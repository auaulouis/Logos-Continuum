[The Saudis]{.underline}, however[, are dependent on expensive U.S.
weapons platforms, and it will be difficult for them to begin buying
weapons from Russia or China. Their weapons systems and aircraft
squadrons are all American, and require almost constant American
repairs]{.underline}. [As a hardball tactic, Congress could try to pass
laws that would effectively ground the Saudi air force. And the next
administration could condition close military systems collaboration on
Saudi behavior.]{.underline} There are other avenues of cooperation, and
the Saudi government's role as the custodian of two of three holiest
mosques in the Islamic faith have made them important symbolic allies.
But gone are the days when Saudis were great financiers of American
foreign-policy adventurism, like funding the mujahideen in Afghanistan
in the '80s. The role of Saudi windfall oil profits and petrodollar
"recycling," which was so important to both U.S. banks and Third World
oil-consuming countries in the 1980s and 1990s, is also long past. [The
human-rights agenda,]{.underline} so often touted as part of U.S.
policy, [**has never held Saudi to much of a standard**.]{.underline} .
Importantly, the Obama administration's support for the 2011 Arab
uprisings frightened the sclerotic Saudi leadership. Washington had sold
out Mubarak, its partner of 30 years. "Clearly, we've given the Saudis a
lesson," Freeman told me. "We reinforced the thought that we can't be
depended on." "A Burgeoning Autocrat" MBS has rattled previous
arrangements to the core. Traditionally, the Royal Court had been a
consultative body that, through consensus with tribes and families,
reached policy decisions. It was a slow process befitting a conservative
kingdom. When King Salman, then 79, took over the throne in 2015, he
appointed his 29-year-old son Mohammed as defense minister, making him
the youngest in the world. MBS in turn launched an impulsive campaign
against a motley militia known as the Houthis who had run much of Yemen
since the state's collapse following the 2011 revolutions. There were
some legitimate threats from unstable Yemen, but the Obama
administration failed to recognize the threats posed by MBS. [Soon the
U.S. was supplying, refueling, and servicing aircraft that Saudi pilots
were using to attack targets in Yemen, killing 971 civilians by late
summer]{.underline}. The prince found support in the Obama
administration. In September 2015, Mohammed bin Salman dined at
Secretary of State John Kerry's home. He took to the piano after dinner
to serenade the guests with Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. "Everybody was
so desperate for change in Saudi that they believed it," Anne Patterson,
who served as the senior Middle East official in the Obama State
Department, told me. While the Yemen war raged, the Obama White House
rolled out the red carpet for the then-deputy crown prince, inviting him
for a meeting with President Obama in June 2016. This wasn't the usual
protocol for a senior court-member's visit. National Security Advisor
Susan Rice, according to the account of a senior Obama official, said,
"Like it or not, he could be the next king." In the process, the Obama
administration had legitimized MBS's rise. "We in the Obama
administration could be faulted for not taking a firmer line with
Mohammed bin Salman on some of the policies saying, hey you can't do
that. Yemen was certainly on our watch," the official told me. "The
signs were there that he could be a burgeoning autocrat." From there,
MBS exhibited a mastery of public relations, inoculating himself from
future criticism by ingratiating himself with so-called thought leaders.
But he didn't hold out the hope of political reform other than on the
role of women, which proved to be a brilliant feint that gulled such
commentators as Thomas Friedman: His much-touted vision for the country
was economic. On his first overseas trip as president, Donald Trump
sword-danced and touched the enigmatic orb in Saudi Arabia. Ever since,
Mohammed bin Salman's destructive actions have accelerated. A 2017 lunch
in the State Dining Room of the White House included President Trump,
his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Saudi Arabia\'s new heir to the
throne, Mohammed bin Salman. "Saudis see themselves as a mirror," said
Patterson, the former diplomat. "As long as they have the king (Donald
Trump) and the crown prince (Jared Kushner)---they're okay. They think
with Trump in their corner they'll be fine." The story we didn't hear at
the time was the prince's reputation as "Abu Rasasa," which translates
idiomatically as Mr. Bullet. As a threat, he had mailed a single bullet
to a Saudi land registry official, as reported by The New Yorker's
Dexter Filkins. MBS's coup, however, didn't require a single bullet. To
become crown prince, he sidelined heir apparent Mohammed bin Nayef, 59,
the longtime security chief and epitome of the Saudi deep state. In June
2017, MBS had put him under house arrest and badmouthed him in the media
as a pain pill--addicted has-been. "As the members of the royal family
look at the crown prince's behavior, they have to be asking the
question, 'Will the House of Saud survive 50 years of Mohammed bin
Salman's decision-making?'" Riedel, the former intelligence official,
told me. "He Is a Saddam, Clearly" [The brutality of MBS can no longer
be overlooked. He has presided over the largest clampdown the kingdom
has ever experienced. Many activists are in prison. Some have been
**tortured or sexually assaulted**. And the Trump administration
**continues to enable him**.]{.underline} Kushner, the president's
son-in-law and adviser, secretly traveled to Saudi Arabia in October
2017. A month later, [Saudi kidnapped and blackmailed Lebanese Prime
Minister Saad Hariri. The U.S. didn't speak up for the Lebanese head of
state.]{.underline} [A few days later, MBS held hostage dozens of
princes, notably Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, among 400 businessmen in the
Riyadh Ritz-Carlton,]{.underline} conducting what might be called the
largest bank robbery in history. [He had effectively neutered the
country's wealthiest. The only major impediments to his absolute power
were activists, journalists, and religious leaders.]{.underline} "[They
are using legal means to kill people because they have different
views]{.underline}, because they demand political change, because they
demand liberties," Abdullah Alaoudh, a law scholar at Georgetown
University, told me. His father, the cleric Salman Alaoudh, was arrested
in 2017. "Just imagine: [They are seeking the death penalty against my
father for holding similar views to Khashoggi." Alaoudh described a
"pattern of cracking down on dissent, irrespective of ideology,"
including liberals, Shiites, and Sunnis.]{.underline} [In early
February, the deadline for the Global Magnitsky Act sanctions against
Khashoggi's killers passed. Under the act, which was passed in 2015, the
president has expansive power to sanction foreign individuals who commit
"gross violations" of human rights, like extrajudicial killings. The
same week, a U.N. rapporteur called the Khashoggi affair "planned and
perpetuated by officials" of Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. "Our leadership
is a red line," the kingdom wrote on social media with a threatening
photo of the king and the crown prince. "We warn against any attempt to
link Khashoggi's crime to our leadership." But in a kingdom where all
decisions are taken by the micromanaging crown prince, the line was
hardly plausible. Expect Congress to be increasingly aggressive in their
condemnations. Eighteen Republicans crossed the aisle to pass a February
13 House resolution to stop aiding the Yemen war, invoking the rarely
used War Powers Resolution. Further action might include holding back
appropriations, blocking arms sales, and maybe passing sanctions
targeting specific individuals in the Saudi government, making it
difficult for them to travel to the U.S. "I think he is a Saddam,
clearly," a senior Senate aide told me. "We need to make clear to Saudi
Arabia: Your relationship is not going to be what it potentially could
be while you have someone like this at the top." [For Congress, the most
urgent task at hand---and the most doable---is ending all support for
the war in Yemen and investing in that country's renewal. The crown
prince's rise is **intimately tied to the grave humanitarian crisis** he
has perpetuated there, fueled by American weaponry and logistical
support.]{.underline} [Ending the Yemen war is a no-brainer given that
the conflict is empowering al-Qaeda and ISIS, while exacerbating human
tragedy that will lead a generation to hate America for selling its
weapons to Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. Halting the war is an important
goal unto itself, and it has the added knock-on effect of punishing
Mohammed bin Salman.

#### Current legislation is insufficient to prevent arms used in violation of human rights, but the aff [reaffirms human rights commitment]{.underline} with a *rebuke* to Saudi Arabia

GMDI

On June 8, while official Washington sat captivated by the testimony of
former FBI Director James Comey, a small group of bipartisan senators
planned to force a vote on a subject near to official Washington's
heart: arms sales to Saudi Arabia. At issue in the vote---which was held
Tuesday afternoon---were precision U.S.-made air weapons systems, part
of a basket of prospective deals worth \$110 billion that the Trump
administration had offered during the president's visit to Riyadh in
May, during his first official trip abroad. They included Paveway bomb
guidance packages, \$350 million of which the Obama administration had
blocked in December over concerns about repeated and deadly Saudi-led
coalition strikes on Yemeni civilians. The vote was close, but the
measure was defeated, meaning the arms sales will go forward. In the
Saudis' view, the refusal to sell the Paveways was only the last of
Obama's many slights. "Any new president has to be better than President
Obama, because no one was worse for us than Obama," the former
editor-in-chief of Asharq al-Awsat, a newspaper owned throughout its
history by members of the Saudi royal family, told The New York Times
ahead of Trump's visit. Never mind that the Obama administration had
been quite good to the Saudis, reportedly boosting the intelligence
support they got from the National Security Agency and offering them
\$115 billion worth of weapons in 42 separate deals over eight years,
more than any previous administration. For the Saudis, nothing made up
for the Obama-led deal to lift sanctions on Iran, their preeminent foe,
in exchange for limits on Iran's nuclear program. Legitimizing Iran was
anathema not only to Saudi Arabia but to much of the Washington
foreign-policy establishment, the "blob" so disparaged by Obama's deputy
national-security adviser Ben Rhodes. Trump's performance in
Riyadh---complete with ardah---was a belly flop into the blob, which has
long supported the seemingly hereditary U.S. alliance with Saudi Arabia,
handed down like an inheritance to generation after generation of Saudi
kings and American presidents. [**A central tenet** of this durable
pro-Saudi dogma, indeed of nearly all U.S. alliances in the Middle East,
is the **sale of U.S. arms**.]{.underline} In 2015, the top three
purchasers among all developing nations worldwide were Qatar (\$17.5
billion), Egypt (\$11.9 billion), and Saudi Arabia (\$8.6 billion). From
2008 to 2015, [Saudi Arabia bought more U.S. weapons than any other
developing nation, agreeing to \$93.5 billion worth of
purchases.]{.underline} (Bruce Riedel of the Brookings Institution has
argued that Trump's Riyadh bonanza was "fake news," a misleading mix of
Obama-era efforts, but while Trump may have been taking credit for past
deals, the weapons have, nevertheless, been offered.) [These sales,
often buoyed by U.S. subsidies known as foreign military financing,
**have continued** **despite** many of the recipients' dark records of
**serious human-rights abuses**]{.underline}---such as the torture,
enforced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings carried out by the
Egyptian military in its campaign against the Islamic State in the Sinai
Peninsula, or the [many possible war crimes committed by the Saudi-led
coalition in its ongoing bombing of Houthi-Saleh forces in Yemen.
Supporters of these sales argue that while these governments may be
ugly, if they don't buy from us, they will buy from the Russians or the
Chinese (or the French), and selling them our weapons gives us greater
say in how those weapons are used, and greater insight into how their
militaries operate]{.underline}. If war breaks out, we'll be able to
work closely with our clients because they'll be using our technology.
Andrew Exum, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for Middle
East policy in the Obama administration, recently argued in this
magazine that progressive politicians should take more credit, not less,
for these sales, given the hundreds of thousands of workers employed in
the U.S. defense industry and the "millions of American mouths" fed by
their salaries. "This might be another area in which progressive elites
... are simply out of touch with the voters they need to win back
control of the Congress and state assemblies, never mind the
presidency," Exum wrote. [But arms sales **don't bring home the jobs**
that supposedly make these deals worth the angst]{.underline}. The
[Costs of War project at Brown University's Watson Institute of
International and Public Affairs has found that "**clean energy and
health care spending** **create 50 percent more jobs** **than** the
equivalent amount of spending on **the military**]{.underline}," while
education spending creates more than twice as many jobs. Boeing's deal
to sell 30 passenger jets to Iran will reportedly support 18,000 U.S.
jobs, the same number Lockheed Martin touted for the air and missile
defense systems, combat ships, and tactical aircraft it may sell to
Saudi Arabia. But passenger jets won't be bombing civilians in Yemen.
Nor were Boeing, Raytheon, or Lockheed Martin even willing to hazard a
guess as to the number of jobs Trump's Riyadh proposals might actually
create, when asked by The Washington Post. In Egypt's case, the
provision of U.S. arms has also not provided the more cynical benefits
put forward by the proponents of such sales. U.S. officials don't always
know how the Egyptian military uses U.S. weapons in the Sinai. In a
leaked video that appeared in April, Egyptian army and militia forces
appeared to have used U.S. Humvees to transport several Sinai men to
their summary executions. More importantly, [**treating values as
negotiable** based on whether they are effective **is a slippery
slope**]{.underline}. (The argument against torture as both
reprehensible and ineffective, for instance, raises the question of how
we would view torture if it worked.) Weapons sales to abusive
governments tweak our conscience, supporters argue, but they offer
benefits. Thou shall not kill, except for votes in swing states. In
theory, [U.S. law came down in favor of values]{.underline} more than
half a century ago, [when Congress passed the F]{.underline}oreign
[A]{.underline}ssistance [A]{.underline}ct in the first year of the
Kennedy administration, [banning security assistance to any government
that "engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of
internationally recognized human rights]{.underline}." U.S. [security
assistance]{.underline}, Congress wrote at the time, [should be provided
in a way that promotes human rights and **avoids identifying** the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [with **abusive
governments**.]{.underline} Fifteen years later, [the A]{.underline}rms
[C]{.underline}ontrol [E]{.underline}xport [A]{.underline}ct [set
up]{.underline} elaborate [procedures to regulate U.S. government and
commercial arms sales and stated that the purpose of such sales should
be limited]{.underline} to essentially three areas: supporting friendly
nations' internal security, legitimate self-defense, or participation in
United Nations-sanctioned actions. The last major piece of legislation,
passed 20 years ago by Democratic Senator Patrick [Leahy]{.underline} as
an [amendment to the F]{.underline}oreign [A]{.underline}ssistance
[A]{.underline}ct[, forbids the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[from training or equipping any unit of a foreign security force if
there is **"credible evidence**"]{.underline} that the unit [has
committed "**gross violations** of human rights." But this]{.underline}
regime of rights-based restrictions [has failed miserably to prevent
U.S. weapons from flowing to abusive governments]{.underline},
especially in the lax environment of the seemingly never-ending conflict
against al-Qaeda, the Islamic State, and whatever progeny will take
their place. Michael Newton, a retired Army officer and professor at the
Vanderbilt University School of Law, recently wrote a persuasive
argument for the American Bar Association's Center for Human Rights that
arms sales to Saudi Arabia, based on that country's various abuses both
domestic and international, violate the conditions of the Foreign
Assistance Act and Arms Control Export Act. ["Saudi Arabia presents an
apparent prima facie case for the immediate cessation of sales under the
FAA," Newton wrote. Even the Leahy Law, which theoretically enables the
State Department to ban aid to abusive units based on even
circumstantial evidence of violations, is riddled with
holes.]{.underline} A 2016 report on military aid to Egypt by the
Government Accountability Office found that the State Department was
failing to record human-rights abuses committed by Egyptian security
forces in its internal database, did not have the organizational charts
necessary to identify problematic Egyptian units and, predictably, could
not track some types of aid, like ammunition, to their final unit. [In
practice, the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, which has
lead responsibility for vetting under the Leahy Law, barely has
the]{.underline} man[power to sift through]{.underline} the billions of
dollars of [arms purchases supported by U.S. subsidies in the form of
foreign military financing, leaving foreign military sales---the
exponentially larger purchases countries make with their own
cash---almost unsupervised.]{.underline} While the Comey hearing may
have rekindled Democrats' dreams of a premature end to the Trump
administration, [the president's arms dealing in Saudi Arabia
highlighted a **deeper strain of U.S. policy** that seems destined to
**outlast him.**]{.underline}

#### The United States is a global model for human rights-- arms sales are a [critical juncture]{.underline} in restoring credibility

GMDI\]

Because [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is the world's
**preeminent** military power,]{.underline} [its use of force is
**watched** **closely**]{.underline}**,** [especially when the White
House has unequivocally pushed for a greater reliance on hard
power]{.underline}. Indeed, the Trump administration has increased
defense spending while reducing foreign aid. It has reversed a policy to
phase out the use of cluster bombs, a particularly indiscriminate
explosive. It has signed secret changes that undo the Obama
administration's more restrictive policies regarding the use of drone
strikes and commando raids, a shift that will inevitably lead to less
transparency and accountability and more civilian deaths. [It
has]{.underline} also **[accelerated arms sales]{.underline}**,
including [to governments **with poor track records** on human
rights]{.underline}, [and has]{.underline} [signaled its intention to
loosen restrictions on arms exports---a shortsighted move that would
prioritize **economic interests** **over values.**]{.underline} In the
fight against the Islamic State, or ISIS, the Trump administration has
demonstrated a noted antipathy toward the laws of war. As a candidate,
Trump promised to "bomb the shit out of" ISIS, and as president, he has
lessened the White House's oversight of air strikes in Iraq and Syria
while giving commanders in the field more control, even as they shifted
to more intense urban warfare. In recent years, the Department of
Defense has sought to make the details of its campaign against ISIS
somewhat more transparent. The Pentagon regularly publishes information
on its website about war costs, and even posts videos of air strikes. It
also publishes a monthly report examining civilian casualties. But over
the last year, human rights groups, the UN, and journalists have found
growing evidence that a dramatically higher number of civilians are
being killed by U.S. forces or U.S.-led coalition forces in Iraq and
Syria (as well as Afghanistan) than what is officially reported. In some
cases, these investigations have found serious violations of the laws of
armed conflict. An exhaustive inquiry by The New York Times Magazine
concluded that the campaign against ISIS may be the least transparent
war in recent U.S. history. The magazine reported that one civilian is
killed for every five coalition air strikes---more than 31 times the
rate the coalition has acknowledged. Parts of this strategic shift began
during the Obama administration. In December 2016, the Pentagon removed
the requirement for a "strike cell" in Baghdad, which had served as a
collection point for information about planned targets for air strikes
in Iraq---an extra check to avoid civilian casualties. But the Trump
administration exacerbated the problem by speeding up the tempo of
operations without doing enough to mitigate civilian harm. The Pentagon
also failed to consistently ensure that there had been adequate checks
on intelligence collection before approving an air strike, and it has
used munitions and firepower generally not considered appropriate for
urban warfare. Investigations to assess allegations of civilian harm in
the aftermath of a lethal strike have become deeply inadequate, hampered
in part by the lack of a clear process for gathering information from
those closest to the ground, such as local activists, emergency
responders, and nongovernmental organizations. SAVING THE SYSTEM
[H]{.underline}uman rights concerns have always competed with national
security considerations. [**For too long,** Washington has adopted
policies in the name of protecting national security that come **at the
expense** of human righ]{.underline}ts, [forgetting the long-term costs
of doing]{.underline} [so.]{.underline} The Obama administration's
[**arms sales** to Saudi Arabia, **despite** the Saudi-led coalition's
unlawful air strikes against civilians in Yemen, **is a prime example**
**of the harm** this approach can do, with **thousands** of civilians
killed and **anti-American sentiment** on the **rise** in the
country.]{.underline} Another is the CIA's secret post-9/11 torture and
rendition program, which the Bush administration launched in violation
of international obligations and U.S. law and which has undermined
Washington's credibility on human rights. [But even as the United States
struggled with how and when to promote human rights, there was always a
common understanding that doing so **was a key part** of what defined
the United States]{.underline}---and what Americans believed was the
right thing for their government to do. Not so under Trump. Although
some lower-level U.S. officials appear committed to keeping human rights
a priority, others have concluded that this may be impossible. In
November, for example, Elizabeth Shackelford, a U.S. Foreign Service
officer who most recently served in Kenya, resigned from the State
Department in protest, writing, "Our government has failed to
demonstrate a commitment to promoting and defending human rights and
democracy." No one who is actually running U.S. foreign policy seems to
believe that the advancement of fundamental rights should be one of its
central pillars. [Given the United States' historically spotty record on
promoting human rights, there are those who think that other governments
can pick up the slack.]{.underline} **[But in reality]{.underline}**,
[the loss of the United States as a champion]{.underline}, **[however
inconsistent]{.underline}** [its support can be]{.underline}, [is likely
to **further encourage governments** to treat their citizens
poorly,]{.underline} [confident that **no meaningful rebuke** will
follow. It is also likely to **create a leadership vacuum**, and the
countries that aim to fill it---such as China, Iran, Russia, and
Venezuela---will no doubt seek to spread their no-strings-attached
approach to global affairs.]{.underline} So what is to be done?
Realistically, the next few years are likely to be hard on human rights.
But despite the absence of U.S. leadership, there have been some bright
spots, with rights-minded countries stepping up. At the UN Human Rights
Council, for example, the Netherlands managed to overcome opposition
from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States to
launch an independent investigation into the Saudi-led campaign in
Yemen. Similarly, Iceland took the lead in drafting and collecting
support from 38 other countries for a joint statement at the council
condemning Duterte's bloody "war on drugs." As long as Trump is in
power, such ad hoc coalitions of like-minded countries will need to
become the norm. [There is also much that other parts of the U.S.
government can do to protect human rights.]{.underline} Just as some
cities and states have decided to comply with the Paris climate
agreement despite the federal government's withdrawal, they can also
find ways to protect immigrants caught up in the Trump administration's
dragnet and keep families and communities intact. [Congress, for its
part, **has already resisted** a number of presidential initiatives in
the interest of human rights.]{.underline} In May, a bipartisan group of
[15 senators sent Trump a letter urging him to "ensure that America
remains a leader in advocating for democracy and human
rights."]{.underline} [Congressional committees are using aid
allocations and authorization bills to push back against the executive
branch]{.underline}. Individual members of Congress are drafting
legislation, holding hearings, and meeting with foreign officials to
stand up for human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Egypt, Russia, and elsewhere. [In December, the Treasury Department,
under pressure from Congress, imposed sanctions on 13
individuals]{.underline}---from Belgium, China, the Dominican Republic,
Gambia, Guatemala, Israel, Myanmar, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Russia, Serbia,
Sudan, and Uzbekistan---for corruption and human rights abuses.

[Of course, U.S. global leadership on democracy and human rights is not
merely based on what it says]{.underline} or does overseas. [What
matters more is the **example** that **America sets**]{.underline}. By
that measure, the Trump administration has already significantly eroded
U.S. credibility. Why would another country listen to the United States
about protecting vulnerable populations, given perceptions that the
immigration and refugee executive order was religiously motivated? What
authority does America have standing up for besieged journalists when
the president of the United States has
[tweeted](https://archive.is/o/2dpsw/https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/832708293516632065?lang=en)
that the news media is the "enemy of the American People?" How can U.S.
diplomats press security partners to protect civilians during military
operations while the White House is
[contemplating](https://archive.is/o/2dpsw/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/12/us/politics/trump-loosen-counterterrorism-rules.html)
loosening drone strike restrictions that seek to prevent civilian
casualties? Rights-abusing countries will have a much easier time
brushing away U.S. criticisms of their behavior so long as these
deficiencies persist at home. Authoritarian governments --- weary of the
United States prodding them on human rights and critical of what they
perceive as Western meddling in their sovereign affairs --- are likely
celebrating this turn of events. The president of Turkey, Recip Tayyip
Erdogan,
[welcomed](https://archive.is/o/2dpsw/www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-turkey-erdogan-idUSKBN1343I8)
Trump's election and heralded an era of greater cooperation.
Increasingly rebuked by the Obama administration for his consolidation
of power and crackdown on the military and judiciary, especially after a
failed coup attempt in July 2016, Erdogan has much to gain by the United
States looking the other way as Turkey creeps toward authoritarianism.
[Countries from Saudi Arabia to Cambodia appear less inhibited in going
after political opponents, assuming that Trump's election means that
they **will get a free pass** on human rights violations]{.underline}.
[By no means is authoritarian retrenchment a new phenomenon. For the
past decade, governments have been dismantling democratic institutions
and curtailing human rights]{.underline}. Freedom House
has[documented](https://archive.is/o/2dpsw/https://freedomhouse.org/article/freedom-world-2017-freedom-decline-continues-amid-rising-populism-and-autocracy)
11 straight years in which there have been more declines in political
and civil liberties than gains. [However, the United States often served
**as a check on the worst impulses** of autocrats]{.underline}. [Without
a champion of human rights in the White House, such regimes will
**likely go unchallenged** as they commit egregious abuses and power
grabs. This capitulation would have major security and economic
consequences for the United States and its closest allies. In addition
to the moral imperative, America has strong interests in supporting
democracy and human rights abroad. First, democratic countries make the
best, **most stable partners**]{.underline}. [Democracies are [more

to get embroiled in conflict. The U.S. military understands the value of
having partners that respect human rights and the rule of law, and thus
invests billions a year in enhancing the professionalism of security
forces overseas]{.underline}. [Recent research has deepened our
understanding of the benefits for American security of having broad and

This Article presents a strategic\--as opposed to ideological or
normative\--argument that [the promotion of human rights should be given
a more prominent place in U.S. foreign policy]{.underline}. It does so
by suggesting a correlation between the domestic human rights practices
of states and their propensity to engage in aggressive international
conduct. [Among the chief threats to]{.underline} U.S. [national
security are acts of aggression by other states]{.underline}. Aggressive
acts of war may directly endanger the United States, as did the Japanese
bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, or they may require U.S. military
action overseas, as in Kuwait fifty years later. [Evidence]{.underline}
from the post-Cold War period  \[\*250\]  [indicates that states that
systematically abuse]{.underline} their own citizens\' [human rights
are]{.underline} also [those most likely to **engage in aggression**. To
the degree that improvements in various states\' human rights records
**decrease the likelihood** of aggressive war]{.underline}, a foreign
[policy informed by human rights can significantly enhance]{.underline}
U.S. and **[global security]{.underline}**. Since 1990, [a state\'s
domestic human rights policy appears to be a **telling indicator** of
that state\'s propensity to engage in international
aggression]{.underline}. A central element of U.S. foreign policy has
long been the preservation of peace and the prevention of such acts of
aggression.

If [the correlation]{.underline} discussed herein is accurate, it
[provides U.S. policymakers with a **powerful new tool to enhance
national security through the promotion of human rights**]{.underline}.
A strategic linkage between national security and human rights would
result in a number of important policy modifications. First, it changes
the prioritization of those countries U.S. policymakers have identified
as presenting the greatest concern. Second, it alters some of the policy
prescriptions for such states. Third, it offers states a means of
signaling benign international intent through the improvement of their
domestic human rights records. Fourth, it provides a way for a current
government to prevent future governments from aggressive international
behavior through the institutionalization of human rights protections.
Fifth, [it addresses the]{.underline} particular [threat of]{.underline}
human rights abusing [states obtaining]{.underline} weapons of mass
destruction (**[WMD]{.underline}**). Finally, it offers a mechanism for
U.S.-U.N. cooperation on human rights issues.

Arabia", June 7, 2019,
<https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/under-trump-arms-deal-high-tech-u-s-bombs-be-n1015346>,
DOA: 6/8/19 GMDI

WASHINGTON --- A controversial [arms deal for Arab allies]{.underline}
approved by the Trump administration [will allow]{.underline} [U.S.
hi-tech bomb]{.underline} [**parts to be manufactured** in Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}, [giving]{.underline} Riyadh unprecedented [access
to a sensitive weapons technology]{.underline}. The [production
arrangement]{.underline} [is part of]{.underline} a larger [\$8.1
billion arms package]{.underline} [for Saudi Arabia,]{.underline} the
United Arab Emirates and Jordan announced two weeks ago. The Trump
administration pressed ahead with the sale without congressional
approval, declaring an \"emergency\" based on what it said was a
heightened threat from Iran. The deal came as a surprise to lawmakers,
who were outraged that the administration chose to bypass Congress. But
most members of Congress only learned days after the [deal]{.underline}
was announced May 24 that it [opens the door]{.underline} [for Saudi
Arabia to host the production of **electronic guidance and control
systems** for Paveway precision-guided bombs]{.underline}, congressional
aides said. The New York Times first reported on the co-production
arrangement. Lawmakers are expected to grill a senior State Department
official --- R. Clarke Cooper, assistant secretary of state for
political-military affairs --- about the arms deal and the bomb
production plan at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing Wednesday.
The U.S. government tends to closely guard technology linked to
sophisticated weapons, and limits how much of that technology is shared
through co-production projects with other countries. Lawmakers opposed
to the deal said the production scheme sent the wrong signal to Saudi
Arabia given its human rights record and its air war in Yemen, raised
security concerns about sharing so-called \"smart bomb\" technology with
Riyadh and undercut one of President Donald Trump\'s arguments for
selling weapons to the Saudis --- to generate jobs in the United States.
\"The concerns over this sale are only one more reason showing the
importance of congressional review and why it is deeply disturbing that
the Trump administration is trying to circumvent the law and Congress to
give the Saudis not only American jobs but also American weapons
technology,\" Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the ranking Democrat on
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said. The co-production plan had
raised eyebrows among some lawmakers more than a year ago when the
administration first tried to secure approval for tens of thousands of
precision-guided bombs to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, a
Democratic congressional aide told NBC News. Menendez held up the sale
of 120,000 precision-guided bombs for Saudi Arabia and the UAE last year
because of numerous accounts of civilian casualties from Saudi-led air
raids in Yemen. The senator has said the administration failed to
persuade him that selling more of the so-called \"smart\" bombs would
prevent more civilian deaths. Human rights, U.N. investigators and aid
groups have accused Saudi Arabia and its allies of striking civilian
targets, including hospitals and schools, in indiscriminate bombing
raids in Yemen since Riyadh launched an armed intervention against
Houthi rebels in 2015. Congressional resistance to weapons sales to
Saudi Arabia only grew after the killing last year of Saudi writer and
Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in
Istanbul. [The Trump administration has defended the arms sale as a way
of ensuring Arab allies can defend themselves amid an allegedly
increased danger from Iran]{.underline}, and that Washington\'s
credibility as a military partner was at risk if it did not deliver
spare parts and other weapons promptly. U.S. officials privately have
also said that maintaining arms sales helps Washington exert a
constructive influence over the kingdom. A State Department official,
who was not authorized to speak on the record, said the production
arrangement \"is not something we would have licensed if we were not
fully confident in both the Saudi ability to protect the technology, as
well as the positive impact on the American defense industrial base.\"
Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, an outspoken critic of U.S.
support for the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen, condemned the production
arrangement. \"[To think that we would co-produce these bombs and in
turn contribute to an **arms race, regional instability, and civilian
deaths** is unfathomable]{.underline},\" Murphy said. \"Congress needs
to put a stop to the way we do business with the Saudis and start acting
like the senior partner in this relationship rather than succumbing to
whatever the kingdom wants.\" \"A secretive monarchy that commits
atrocities in Yemen, that murders dissidents and journalists and lies to
the world about it, and that treats women as property is not one to
which we should be giving some of our most sensitive military
technology,\" Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said. The Paveway bombs can
strike a target within 10 feet when fired from 40,000 feet, according to
William Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the
Washington-based Center for International Policy, and will almost
certainly be used in the war in Yemen. \"The weapons are going to be put
to use in a civilian slaughter,\" he said. The deal fits in with Saudi
Arabia\'s long term economic plan, Saudi Vision 2030, which calls for
the country to dramatically increase its domestic arms production.
[\"They are trying to build up their own military manufacturing
base,\"]{.underline} Hartung said. But [the assembly of bomb parts in
the kingdom raises security and proliferation questions for the United
States]{.underline}, he added. \"[If they can master the production
process, **they could sell it.\"**]{.underline}

The [U.S. Defense Department]{.underline} [announced]{.underline} March
4 that [it]{.underline} recently [awarded Lockheed Martin]{.underline} a
nearly \$1 billion [contrac]{.underline}t [to begin work]{.underline}
[on a]{.underline} [Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)
ballistic missile defense]{.underline} [package for Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}. The **[contract marks the start]{.underline}** of a
\$15 billion deal **[for the kingdom to receive 44 THAAD
batteries]{.underline}**, including 360 missile interceptors. The
contract followed November 2018 letters of offer and acceptance between
the United States and Saudi Arabia formalizing terms for the sale of the
THAAD launchers, missiles, and related equipment. The \$15 billion
package is part of a larger \$110 billion weapons deal that the United
States negotiated with Saudi leaders in 2017. The November letters were
exchanged as the United States was under political pressure to reduce
defense cooperation with Saudi Arabia following the October 2018 murder
of Jamal Khashoggi, a commentator for The Washington Post, and amid
concerns about U.S. support for Saudi military actions in Yemen. [The
initial sale was approved by the State Department]{.underline} and
Congress in August 2017 and November 2017, respectively, when there was
speculation that Riyadh was negotiating to purchase Russian S-400 air
defense systems. Russian-Saudi talks on an S-400 transfer remain
underway this year, according to Alexander Mikheyev, chief executive
officer of Russia's state arms exporter Rosoboronexport.---SHERVIN

#### THAAD purchases by Saudi Arabia fuel [Iranian military modernization]{.underline} that triggers [Iranian proliferation]{.underline} 

**Stein 19** \[Aaron Stein is the Director of the Middle East Program at
the Foreign Policy Research Institute, "Middle East Missile Race: The
Missile Defense Review, Iran, and the Implications for the Gulf",
January 24, 2019,

DOA: 6/9/19 GMDI

Despite these challenges, individual [GCC states remain
committed]{.underline} [to purchasing]{.underline} and fielding Patriot
and [Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD]{.underline})
[anti-missile systems]{.underline}. These two systems are designed for
different purposes: Patriot is designed for point defense from
medium-range ballistic missiles (which have ranges between 1,000 and
3,000 km), whereas THAAD can defend a larger area and engage faster
flying intermediate-range ballistic missiles (3,000 to 5,500 km range).
Saudi Arabia has deployed Patriot, has committed to upgrading its
current missiles to the most advanced PAC-3 interceptor, and has
expressed interest in THAAD. The United Arab Emirates, too, has
purchased Patriot and deployed the more advanced PAC-3 version to a
staging base in Djibouti to protect its forces from Houthi missile
attack. Emirati forces also operate THAAD. Qatar will soon begin
operating Patriot and hosts a U.S. TPY-2 radar, which is used to track
and cue missile interceptors, while Kuwait has operated (and hosted)
Patriot for decades. [The proliferation of ballistic missile
defense]{.underline} [has **prompted Iranian
countermoves**]{.underline}, [designed to **ensure that its missiles**
can defeat U.S.-made defenses]{.underline}. To do so, Iran is pursuing
four distinct approaches. First, [Tehran is investing in more short- and
medium-range **missile**s]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} [when
fired]{.underline} [in large numbers would]{.underline} [overwhelm and
defeat the]{.underline} comparatively [smaller number of missile defense
systems deployed]{.underline}. Second, [Iran is experimenting
with]{.underline} creative and [**asymmetric approaches** to attack
missile defense radars]{.underline}, [including with
low-tech]{.underline}, off-the-shelf [drones]{.underline} that have
reportedly been used in Yemen to target Patriot radars. Third, recent
imagery from a Qiam missile launch in September 2018 shows small fins at
the base of the re-entry vehicle, which could possibly [indicate an
interest in developing]{.underline} some [late-stage maneuvering
capabilities to defeat terminal missile defense]{.underline}, or, at the
very least, to improve stability and increase precision. Finally, the
Islamic Republic [remains interested in the further development of
cruise missiles. These missiles fly low to the ground and, therefore,
pose a challenge for missile defenses designed to track and engage
targets flying a ballistic trajectory]{.underline}. There are also
indications that Iran is more confident using its ballistic missiles. In
June 2017, Iran fired 6 missiles at targets in Syria, two, of which, the
solid-fuel Zolfaqhar missile, hit impact points in Mayadeen, a small
town the Islamic State formerly held in eastern Syria. To monitor battle
damage, and then for propaganda purposes, Iran filmed the impacts with a
Shahed-129 drone deployed in Syria, as part of the Iranian support given
to the Syrian regime. Following the strike in Syria, Iran used ballistic
missiles to strike the headquarters of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of
Iran (KDP-I) in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The Islamic Republic has
also transferred the Qiam ballistic missile to the Houthis in Yemen and
has struck targets throughout the Kingdom, including Riyadh. The war in
Yemen has underscored the difficulty of finding and targeting mobile
missiles before they are launched. The Saudi-led coalition has the tools
to search for missiles on the ground, but the Houthis have still managed
to fire Qiam missiles at least eight times since July 2017 without being
detected from the air. Despite these challenges, it is important for the
defender to include counterforce, specifically the ability to target
missiles before they are launched, in the broader effort to defend
against missile attack. For Iran, the lessons-lessons-learned from the
first Gulf War, when the United States dedicated considerable resources
(albeit with limited success) to find and attack Iraqi Scud missiles
before they were launched, probably informed thinking about future
missile development. Despite the challenges the U.S. faced in actually
finding Iraqi Scuds, investments to ensure that missiles remain
survivable from detection and air attack in the future, when U.S.
sensors and capabilities are certain to improve, probably drove Iranian
interests in fielding a more mobile missile force. In the late-1990s,
the Emirati Air Force purchased the Franco-British air-launched cruise
missile SCALP/Storm Shadow for Mirage and Tornado aircraft---a useful
weapon to target air defense sites and to hit targets of convenience at
long range. Following the Emirati purchase, Saudi Arabia purchased the
same missile in the mid-2000s. As Jeffrey Lewis noted, the United States
objected to the sale of the missile to the UAE in the 1990s because it
violated the voluntary guidelines under the Missile Technology Control
Regime (MTCR), which established a common presumption against the export
of missiles capable of carrying a 500 kg payload to more than 300 km.
The United States was less vocal in its criticism of the Saudi purchase,
but that appears to be linked to the fact that the United Kingdom kept
the sale under wraps and never talked much about it. However, as is the
case with the spread of missile defense, it appears as if the [spread of
more accurate cruise missiles for countries in the Gulf has sparked an
Iranian counter]{.underline}, [focused on the development of
solid-fueled missiles]{.underline}. This fuel type is more operationally
flexible than liquid fuel because solid-fueled missiles can be stored
and transported fully fueled without the larger supporting
infrastructure needed to fire liquid-fueled missiles. One benefit, of
course, is that the aerial signature for solid-fueled missiles is much
smaller, which makes them harder to hit before launch. [Iran's interests
in solid-fueled missiles, like the Zolfaqhar, may be indicative of the
missile race in the region, wherein each side's effort to counter the
other prompts further **technological developments to offset any
advantage**]{.underline}. As the United States develops strategies for
regional missile defense, and announces plans in the MDR about how to
use missile defense to enhance partnerships with regional allies, [it is
worth noting how the Islamic Republic has responded to incremental
American changes in strategy]{.underline}. Rather than try to overcome
U.S. technological dominance, [Iran is using low-cost means to counter
sophisticated defenses and developing missiles to try to
evade]{.underline} ever-more capable [precision-guided
weapons]{.underline} [and sophisticated sensors]{.underline}. [This is
certain to continue]{.underline}, [given]{.underline} that the Gulf Arab
element of the MDR repeats [the long-standing **American effort** to
make regional defenses **more capable**]{.underline}---[a]{.underline}n
entirely reasonable [strategy]{.underline}, but one [destined to invite
countermoves by Iran]{.underline}. Over the longer term, the importance
of missiles for national defense---whether for offense or
defense---shows little signs of abating. Instead, recent events in Iran
and the Gulf underscore how important missiles are becoming for a wide
swathe of countries' self-defined national security priorities. [These
dynamics point to a **near-term missile race** in the Middle East, an
outcome that could further **destabilize a region rife with
conflict**.]{.underline}

#### Nuclear exchanges are likely\-\--Iranian prolif uniquely guarantees it

Eric **Schlosser 14**, the author of Command and Control: the story of
nuclear weapons and the illusion of safety, \"Why we must rid the world
of nuclear weapons,\" 11-27-2014, Guardian,
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/27/nuclear-weapons-near-misses-iran-bomb-peace,
DOA: 1-22-2015, y2k

Much has been written about the nuclear negotiations with Iran. While
diplomacy has received a great deal of attention, one important question
too often gets lost in the details: why Iran must not get the bomb. In
my view, the answer is quite **[simple. [An Iran armed with nuclear
weapons would pose a]{.mark} [grave threat]{.mark}]{.underline}** not
only **[to world peace]{.underline}** but to the Iranian people. Almost
70 years have passed since the destruction of Nagasaki, the last time a
nuclear weapon was used against a civilian target. The cold war ended
without a nuclear exchange, and the dangers of nuclear terrorism remain
speculative, thus far. [[The fact that a nuclear catastrophe hasn't
occurred]{.mark} since 1945]{.underline} [encourages the belief
that]{.underline} because it hasn't happened, [it won't
happen]{.underline}. Or even that it can't happen. An influential
American academic, Kenneth Waltz, considered the proliferation of
nuclear weapons to be a good thing; the more countries that obtained
them, the better. "Those who like peace should love nuclear weapons,"
Waltz argued. "They are the only weapons ever invented that work
decisively against their own use." Many academics now agree with his
contention that nuclear weapons discourage warfare between the states
that possess them, stabilise international relations, and encourage
world leaders to be more cautious. [That argument]{.underline} does, in
fact, accurately describe the recent diplomatic history of nuclear
weapon states. But it [[reveals **nothing about the
future**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It's true -- until one day, it isn't.
[Every country that possesses]{.underline} nuclear [weapons must contend
with]{.underline} their inherent **[risks]{.underline}**. They are the
most dangerous machines ever invented, extremely difficult to manage,
for reasons both technical and administrative. Like every manmade
object, they are imperfect. And so are the people who control them. The
US first devised this technology, perfected it, gained more experience
with it than any other nation -- and yet has come close on numerous
occasions to having American cities destroyed accidentally by American
nuclear weapons. **[[Political instability]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
almost half the countries with nuclear weapons [[has been
**a**]{.mark}]{.underline} potential [**[source of
catastrophe]{.mark}**.]{.underline} **[[Split-second
decision-making]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[has brought the
world]{.underline} [close to **nuclear war**]{.underline}]{.mark} more
than once and then narrowly averted it. The Pentagon has long claimed
that only 32 serious accidents have occurred with American nuclear
weapons. But a document that I obtained through the Freedom of
Information Act listed more than a thousand accidents involving US
nuclear weapons just between the years of 1950 and 1968. Many of those
accidents were trivial; others were more likely to produce a full-scale
nuclear detonation than some of the accidents on the official list.
Seemingly innocuous things could have led to disaster. A tiny metal nut
that came off a screw inside a B-52 bomber created a new electrical
pathway, circumventing a safety switch and fully arming four hydrogen
bombs. A maintenance technician investigating a faulty intruder alarm at
a missile silo pulled the wrong fuse with a screwdriver, caused a short
circuit, and blew the warhead off a missile. Four rubber seat cushions
inadvertently stowed near a heat vent in the cockpit of a B-52 set the
plane on fire, forced the crew to bail out mid-flight, and could have
detonated hydrogen bombs at one of America's most important, top-secret
military installations. Other [countries came up with nuclear weapon
designs that were]{.underline} vastly **[less safe]{.underline}**. Had
Saddam Hussein built nuclear weapons, they might have posed a greater
threat to Baghdad than to any of his enemies. "It could go off if a
rifle bullet hit it," a UN inspector said about an Iraqi weapon design.
"I wouldn't want to be around if it fell off the edge of this desk."
Five years ago [[Iran was racked by]{.underline}]{.mark} massive
[[demo]{.mark}nstrations; the "green movement" seeking democracy was
violently suppressed.]{.underline} **[Political
instability]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[nuclear
weapons]{.underline}** [are not a good combination]{.underline}.
[According to]{.underline} Bruno [Tertrais]{.underline}, a former
official in the French ministry of defence and a proliferation expert,
[four of the nine countries that now possess nuclear weapons are "known
to have undergone severe **political crises**]{.underline} affecting
nuclear security and/or control of use in one way or another". A recent
book edited by Tertrais and Henry Sokolski, a former Pentagon official,
describes how a group of French generals plotting a coup against
President De Gaulle in the spring of 1961 tried to obtain a nuclear
device that France was about to test in the Algerian desert. "Refrain
from detonating your little bomb," one of the generals told the
commander in charge of the test. "Keep it for us, it will always be
useful." De Gaulle ordered the device to be set off earlier than
planned, and the coup was unsuccessful. During the Cultural Revolution
in China, members of the red guards launched a missile with a nuclear
warhead on a flight path over populated areas -- an extremely risky and
perhaps unauthorised launch. For a few days in the summer of 1991, all
three "chegets", the small handheld devices that controlled the Soviet
Union's nuclear arsenal, were in the hands of military officials trying
to seize power and overthrow President Mikhail Gorbachev. And Pakistan,
the nation with the world's fastest-growing nuclear arsenal, has had
three military coups since the late 1960s, four prime ministers removed
from power since the late 1980s, and an Islamist insurgency determined
to topple the government. [[Even with the best of intentions]{.mark} and
a sincere desire to avoid nuclear war, the complexity of weapons
systems]{.underline}, **[[the unreliability of communications
systems]{.underline}]{.mark}** and human fallibility [can
[precipitate]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[disaster]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
During the Cuban missile crisis, John F Kennedy and the Soviet leader
Nikita Khruschev did all they could to avoid a conflict. And yet events
beyond their knowledge or control -- an American U-2 spy plane that
accidentally strayed into Soviet territory, the test of an American
ballistic missile without Kennedy's approval, the delegation of
authority for the use of nuclear weapons to Soviet commanders in Cuba
and the captains of Soviet submarines -- almost started a war that
neither leader wanted. On October 27 1962, off the coast of Cuba, when
American forces dropped practice depth charges to force a Soviet
submarine to the surface, two of the three officers in charge of the sub
voted to respond by firing nuclear weapons. They mistakenly believed the
submarine was under attack. Vasili Arkhipov, the second-in-command,
refused to authorise the use of nuclear weapons, and the vote to do so
had to be unanimous. Arkhipov's refusal prevented the world's first
nuclear war. [[Given Iran's **technical**, **political** and
**leadership** challenges]{.underline}, [its pursuit of nuclear weapons
seems an invitation to disaste]{.underline}r]{.mark}. Moreover, Iran
signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in 1970. Getting the bomb
would violate that treaty, encourage other countries to violate it and
discourage Israel from ever submitting nuclear facilities to
international inspection. **[A nuclear arms race]{.underline}** in the
Middle East [would]{.underline} [endanger every country in the
region]{.underline}; the effects of a nuclear detonation would spread
without regard to national borders. And **[possessing nuclear weapons
would make Iran the target of other nuclear states.]{.underline}** Early
next month, officials from 150 countries meet in Vienna to discuss the
humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons and a treaty to ban them. The
world was lucky in the 20th century to avoid a nuclear Armageddon. In
the 21st century a new international consensus is emerging: nuclear
weapons are only useful for killing or terrorising civilians. The number
of weapons worldwide must be reduced with the goal of some day reaching
zero. [A new nuclear arms race, new states possessing nuclear weapons,
and a breakdown of the nonproliferation regime are the antithesis of
those goals.]{.underline} And **[that]{.underline}**, among many other
reasons, **[is why Iran must not get the bomb]{.underline}**.

Lack of transparency in military matters makes it difficult to determine
the extent to which Saudi Arabia's high levels of military spending and
arms procurement are driven by defensive or offensive motives, military
or prestige considerations, internal power play or the possibility for
government officials to [enrich
themselves](http://government.defenceindex.org/countries/saudi-arabia/).
[However, it is clear that Saudi Arabia is]{.underline} [no longer just
stocking up on weapons]{.underline}. [It is]{.underline} actually [using
them **on a large scale** in]{.underline} an offensive operation in
[Yemen]{.underline}. [Preparations for]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
[future use of armed force]{.underline} [elsewhere]{.underline} should
not be excluded as [a motive for the]{.underline} continuing [high level
of militarization]{.underline}. Saudi Arabia might perceive its failure
to win the war in Yemen as an indication of the limitations of its
military arsenal. On the other hand, [it could perceive the operations
in Yemen as preventing a complete takeover of Yemen by allies of
Iran]{.underline}, forcing the Houthi rebels to agree on negotiations
and providing an opportunity for its armed forces to gain significant
experience of warfare. [Such perceptions combined with further arms
acquisitions that enhance the reach and strike power of its armed forces
may embolden the Saudi leadership to view the use of force as an
**increasingly central part** of its foreign policy]{.underline},
[regional power aspirations and responses to real or perceived threats
from, among others, Iran, Qatar, or internal groups]{.underline}. As
Yemen dramatically illustrates, [there are major risks for national and
regional **security, stability, peace, development** and the
humanitarian situation that relate to militarized foreign and security
policies in the Middle East]{.underline}. States should therefore
reassess the possible short- and long-term consequences of their arms
exports to Saudi Arabia, ensure that a questionable narrative of
economic gain does not drive such arms sales and consider if and how
arms supplies can have a role at all in conflict resolution in the
Middle East

#### Iran-Saudi war goes nuclear

Returning to Netanyahu's speech, while his portrait of an Iran eager to
destroy Israel with nuclear weapons may have been embellished, the prime
minister was nonetheless correct in asserting that proliferation in Iran
will lead to proliferation throughout the region. The recent
announcement that Saudi Arabia will acquire nuclear technology from
South Korea was, in effect, a declaration that Saudi Arabia will pursue
its own nuclear weapons. As the chief Sunni power in the region, Saudi
Arabia looks north, to Iranian forces in Iraq, and south, to Iran's
Houthi allies in Yemen, as evidence of Iranian encirclement. For the
time being, Saudi Arabia and Israel are allied against the idea of a
nuclear Iran, yet [[a nuclear Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [would be]{.mark} far
more [dangerous]{.mark} to the interests of Israel and the United States
than Iran.]{.underline} Like Pakistan, [[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia's [history
of]{.mark} double dealing and [political instability would leave]{.mark}
the [security of its]{.mark} nuclear [arsenal in doubt]{.mark}. On
paper, [Saudi nuc]{.mark}lear [weapons would be aimed at Iran]{.mark},
but [Saudi-supported]{.mark} Sunni [terrorism]{.mark}, which [is]{.mark}
more ubiquitous and --- in the case of ISIS --- **[more apocalyptic than
its Shi'a counterpart]{.mark}**, raises the possibility of so-called
"loose nukes" falling into Islamist hands. Iran, in turn, has a major
incentive to neutralize the Saudi threat on its own. The danger of [a
Saudi nuc]{.mark}lear [weapon]{.mark}, coupled with irredentist designs
on Saudi Arabia's beleaguered Shi'a provinces, [might tempt Iran to
**launch a preemptive war against Saudi**]{.mark}]{.underline} Arabia.
If Iran could acquire a weapon first, then the likelihood of such a war
would increase exponentially. In any case, [[a war]{.mark} between Saudi
Arabia and Iran [would have **dire consequences** for the]{.mark} region
and possibly the [world]{.mark}. [To avoid prolif]{.mark}eration in
Saudi Arabia and the concomitant threat of war, [America
must]{.mark}]{.underline} not only limit the transfer of nuclear
technology to the Arabian peninsula; it must also **[[solve
Saudi]{.mark} Arabia's [security dilemma]{.mark} by rolling back Iranian
hegemonic gains before Iran gets a nuclear weapon]{.underline}** while
credibly providing extended nuclear deterrence against any future
Iranian attack. While the US maintains a strong conventional military
committment to Saudi Arabia, placing Riyadh under the American nuclear
umbrella is still a work in progress.

#### Conflict with Iran spills over\-\--causes Iranian blocking of the Strait of Hormuz 

**Taylor 19** \[Adam Taylor writes about foreign affairs for The

Judging from appearances, the United States and Iran are worryingly
close to conflict. This weekend, only days after the United States
dispatched warships and bombers to the Middle East to deter what it
deemed Iranian threats, two Saudi oil tankers and a Norwegian ship were
damaged in apparent acts of sabotage in the Persian Gulf. The dispute
between a U.S. administration led by a tough-talking Republican
president and an embattled but antagonistic Middle Eastern power has
reminded many observers of the run-up to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq
in 2003 --- a move that, in the years since, has been widely condemned
as disastrous for all involved. Even some of the characters in this
apparent remake are the same: John Bolton, President Trump's national
security adviser, played a key role in President George W. Bush's
buildup to the Iraq invasion as undersecretary of state for arms control
and international security. Bolton's actions at the time earned him a
reputation as reckless. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif
appeared to allude to him on Tuesday, telling reporters that "extremist
individuals in the U.S. administration" were falsely trying to blame
Iran for the incidents in the Persian Gulf. Despite the similarities,
**[a conflict with Iran]{.underline}** [would]{.underline}
[not]{.underline} simply [be a redux of the 2003 war with
Iraq]{.underline}. [It would be]{.underline} quite
[different]{.underline} in many ways --- [and it]{.underline}
[would]{.underline} almost certainly **[be substantially worse.
Present]{.underline}**-day [Iran]{.underline} [is a]{.underline}
significantly [different country compared to Iraq in 2003]{.underline}.
The way it would fight a war is very different, too. If nothing else,
[Iran]{.underline} [is]{.underline} simply [a bigger
country]{.underline} than Iraq was before the 2003 invasion. At the
time, Iraq's population was about 25 million. [Iran's population
is]{.underline} estimated to be [more than 82 million]{.underline}.
[Iran spans 591,000 square miles of land, compared with Iraq's 168,000
square miles]{.underline}. One estimate from 2005 suggested the Iraqi
army had fewer than 450,000 personnel when the invasion began. Recent
estimates suggest that Iran has 523,000 active military personnel, as
well as 250,000 reserve personnel. Just as important, however, is Iran's
location. Unlike Iraq, Iran is a maritime power bordered by the Caspian
sea to the north and the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman to the south.
It shares land borders with several troubled U.S. allies, including
Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkey and Iraq. [Its location in the center of
Eurasia is]{.underline} particularly [important for trade]{.underline}.
About [a third of the world's]{.underline} [oil tanker traffic passes
through **the Strait of Hormuz,**]{.underline} [which is bordered by
Iran]{.underline} and Oman. [At]{.underline} its [narrowest
point]{.underline}, this [shipping route is just]{.underline} under [two
miles wide]{.underline}. [**Blocking it could** lead shipments of daily
global oil exports to **drop by**]{.underline} an estimated **[30
percent]{.underline}**. In terms of conventional military strength,
[Iran]{.underline} is far weaker than the United States. But the country
[has long pursued asymmetric strategies]{.underline} [that]{.underline}
could [allow it to **inflict serious damage** on U.S.
interests]{.underline} in the region. Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps,
a force loyal to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and
separate from the regular military, has an external [special operations
arm]{.underline} [known as the Quds Force]{.underline} that has [helped
build proxy forces in places such as Iraq, Lebanon and
Syria]{.underline}. It funds militias such as Hezbollah, which is
powerful in its own right. Iran has used these type of groups to target
Americans before. Earlier this year, a revised Pentagon estimate found
Iranian proxy forces had killed at least 608 U.S. troops in Iraq between
2003 and 2011. [Iranian proxies could cause **havoc in Iraq and
Afghanistan** again]{.underline}. [Iran's navy has a]{.underline} real
[advantage against the United States]{.underline}, too. [It doesn't need
big ships]{.underline} or firepower [to block]{.underline} off the
[Strait of Hormuz]{.underline}, for example, [but could use mines or
submarines to force a halt in trade]{.underline}. [U.S. war
games]{.underline} [have suggested that speedboat suicide attacks and
missiles could be]{.underline} surprisingly [effective against the
American military]{.underline}. A 2017 report from the Office of Naval
Intelligence found that the navy of the Revolutionary Guard, which is
distinct from Iran's regular navy and focuses on smaller and faster but
still heavily armed vessels, had received more responsibilities to
protect the Persian Gulf. Then there's [Iran's ballistic missile
program]{.underline}, which the Missile Threat Project at the [Center
for Strategic and International Studies describes as "**the largest and
most diverse missile arsenal** in the Middle East]{.underline}." The
threat from Iranian missile technology extends beyond the country's
borders, too: Hezbollah is thought to have an arsenal of 130,000
rockets. If the United States were to engage in a military conflict with
Iran, it would probably require significant manpower that would
otherwise be used to check bigger powers such as China or Russia. The
New York Times reported Monday that Trump's acting defense secretary,
Patrick Shanahan, drew up plans to deploy 120,000 U.S. troops to the
region if Iran attacks American forces or restarts its nuclear program;
this was based on a scenario that did not involve an invasion, which
would require more troops.

#### Aggression in the strait of Hormuz tanks the global economy 

**Friedman 12** George Friedman, PhD in Government from Cornell
University, Founder and Chief Intelligence Officer at Stratfor, "Iran,
the U.S. and the Strait of Hormuz Crisis", Stratfor, 1-17,
https://www.stratfor.com/weekly/iran-us-and-strait-hormuz-crisis

This week, a routine rotation of U.S. aircraft carriers is taking place
in the Middle East, with the potential for three carrier strike groups
to be on station in the U.S. Fifth Fleet\'s area of operations and a
fourth carrier strike group based in Japan about a week\'s transit from
the region. Next week, Gen. Michael Dempsey, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, will travel to Israel to meet with senior Israeli
officials. [And [Iran is scheduling]{.mark} another set of [war
games]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Persian Gulf for February
[[that]{.mark} will [focus on]{.mark}]{.underline} the Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps\' [irregular tactics for [closing the
Strait]{.mark}]{.underline} [of Hormuz]{.underline}.∂ While **[[tensions
are escalating]{.mark} in the Persian Gulf]{.underline}**, the financial
crisis in Europe has continued, with downgrades in France\'s credit
rating the latest blow. Meanwhile, China continued its struggle to
maintain exports in the face of economic weakness among its major
customers while inflation continued to increase the cost of Chinese
exports.∂ Fundamental changes in how Europe and China work and their
long-term consequences represent the major systemic shifts in the
international system. In the more immediate future, however, the
U.S.-Iranian dynamic has the most serious potential consequences for the
world.∂ The U.S.-Iranian Dynamic∂ The increasing tensions in the region
are not unexpected. As we have argued for some time, the U.S. invasion
of Iraq and the subsequent decision to withdraw created a massive power
vacuum in Iraq that Iran needed --- and was able --- to fill. Iran and
Iraq fought a brutal war in the 1980s that caused about 1 million
Iranian casualties, and Iran\'s fundamental national interest is
assuring that no Iraqi regime able to threaten Iranian national security
re-emerges. The U.S. invasion and withdrawal from Iraq provided Iran an
opportunity to secure its western frontier, one it could not pass on.∂
If Iran does come to have a dominant influence in Iraq --- and I don\'t
mean Iran turning Iraq into a satellite --- several things follow. Most
important, the status of the Arabian Peninsula is subject to change. On
paper, Iran has the most substantial conventional military force of any
nation in the Persian Gulf. Absent outside players, power on paper is
not insignificant. While technologically sophisticated, the military
strength of the Arabian Peninsula nations on paper is much smaller, and
they lack the Iranian military\'s ideologically committed manpower.∂ But
Iran\'s direct military power is more the backdrop than the main engine
of Iranian power. It is the strength of Tehran\'s covert capabilities
and influence that makes Iran significant. Iran\'s covert intelligence
capability is quite good. It has spent decades building political
alliances by a range of means, and not only by nefarious methods. The
Iranians have worked among the Shia, but not exclusively so; they have
built a network of influence among a range of classes and religious and
ethnic groups. And they have systematically built alliances and
relationships with significant figures to counter overt U.S. power. With
U.S. military power departing Iraq, Iran\'s relationships become all the
more valuable.∂ [The [withdrawal]{.mark} of U.S. forces [has]{.mark} had
[a]{.mark} **profound [psychological impact]{.mark}** on the political
elites of the Persian Gulf.]{.underline} Since the decline of British
power after World War II, the [United States has been the **guarantor**
of the Arabian Peninsula\'s elites and therefore of the flow of oil from
the region]{.underline}. The foundation of that guarantee has been
military power, as seen in the response to Iraq\'s invasion of Kuwait in
1990. [The **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates still [[has substantial]{.mark}
military [power]{.mark} in the Persian Gulf, and its air and naval
[forces **could**]{.mark} **likely [cope]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} any
overt [provocation]{.mark} by Iran.∂]{.underline} But that\'s not how
the Iranians operate. For all their rhetoric, they are cautious in their
policies. This does not mean they are passive. It simply means that they
avoid high-risk moves. They will rely on their covert capabilities and
relationships. Those relationships now exist in an environment in which
many reasonable Arab leaders see a shift in the balance of power, with
the United States growing weaker and less predictable in the region and
Iran becoming stronger. This provides fertile soil for Iranian allies to
pressure regional regimes into accommodations with Iran.∂ The Syrian
Angle∂ Events in Syria compound this situation. The purported imminent
collapse of Syrian President Bashar al Assad\'s regime in Syria has
proved less imminent than many in the West imagined. At the same time,
the isolation of the al Assad regime by the West --- and more important,
by other Arab countries --- has created a situation where the regime is
more dependent than ever on Iran.∂ Should the al Assad regime --- or the
Syrian regime without al Assad --- survive, Iran would therefore enjoy
tremendous influence with Syria, as well as with Hezbollah in Lebanon.
The current course in Iraq coupled with the survival of an Alawite
regime in Syria would create an Iranian sphere of influence stretching
from western Afghanistan to the Mediterranean. This would represent a
fundamental shift in the regional balance of power and probably would
redefine Iranian relations with the Arabian Peninsula. This is obviously
in Iran\'s interest. It is not in the interests of the United States,
however.∂ The United States has sought to head this off via a twofold
response. Clandestinely, it has engaged in an active campaign of
sabotage and assassination targeting Iran\'s nuclear efforts. Publicly,
it has created a sanctions regime against Iran, most recently targeting
Iran\'s oil exports. However, the latter effort faces many challenges.∂
Japan, the No. 2 buyer of Iranian crude, has pledged its support but has
not outlined concrete plans to reduce its purchases. The Chinese and
Indians --- Iran\'s No. 1 and 3 buyers of crude, respectively --- will
continue to buy from Iran despite increased U.S. pressure. In spite of
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner\'s visit last week, the Chinese
are not prepared to impose sanctions, and the Russians are not likely to
enforce sanctions even if they agreed to them. Turkey is unwilling to
create a confrontation with Iran and is trying to remain a vital trade
conduit for the Iranians regardless of sanctions. At the same time,
while the Europeans seem prepared to participate in harder-hitting
sanctions on Iranian oil, they already have delayed action on these
sanctions and certainly are in no position politically or otherwise to
participate in military action. The European economic crisis is at root
a political crisis, so even if the Europeans could add significant
military weight, which they generally lack, concerted action of any sort
is unlikely.∂ Neither, for that matter, does the United States have the
ability to do much militarily. Invading Iran is out of the question. The
mountainous geography of Iran, a nation of about 70 million people,
makes direct occupation impossible given available American forces.∂ Air
operations against Iran are an option, but they could not be confined to
nuclear facilities. Iran still doesn\'t have nuclear weapons, and while
nuclear weapons would compound the strategic problem, the problem would
still exist without them. The center of gravity of Iran\'s power is the
relative strength of its conventional forces in the region. Absent
those, Iran would be less capable of wielding covert power, as the
psychological matrix would shift.∂ An air campaign against Iran\'s
conventional forces would play to American military strengths, but it
has two problems. First, it would be an extended campaign, one lasting
months. Iran\'s capabilities are large and dispersed, and as seen in
Desert Storm and Kosovo against weaker opponents, such operations take a
long time and are not guaranteed to be effective. Second, the Iranians
have counters. One, of course, is the Strait of Hormuz. The second is
the use of its special operations forces and allies in and out of the
region to conduct terrorist attacks. An extended air campaign coupled
with terrorist attacks could increase distrust of American power rather
than increase it among U.S. allies, to say nothing of the question of
whether Washington could sustain political support in a coalition or
within the United States itself.∂ The Covert Option∂ The United States
and Israel both have covert options as well. They have networks of
influence in the region and highly capable covert forces, which they
have said publicly that they would use to limit Iran\'s acquisition of
nuclear weapons without resorting to overt force. We assume, though we
lack evidence, that the assassination of the Iranian chemist associated
with the country\'s nuclear program last week was either a U.S. or
Israeli operation or some combination of the two. Not only did it
eliminate a scientist, it also bred insecurity and morale problems among
those working on the program. It also signaled the region that the
United States and Israel have options inside Iran.∂ The U.S. desire to
support an Iranian anti-government movement generally has failed. Tehran
showed in 2009 that it could suppress demonstrations, and it was obvious
that the demonstrators did not have the widespread support needed to
overcome such repression. Though the United States has sought to support
internal dissidents in Iran since 1979, it has not succeeded in
producing a meaningful threat to the clerical regime. Therefore, covert
operations are being aimed directly at the nuclear program with the hope
that successes there might ripple through other, more immediately
significant sectors.∂ As we have long argued, the Iranians already have
a \"nuclear option,\" namely, [the prospect of [blockading]{.mark} the
Strait of [Hormuz, through which]{.mark} roughly 35 percent of seaborne
crude and [20 percent of]{.mark} the world\'s traded [oil passes]{.mark}
daily. **Doing so would hurt them, too, of course**. But [failing to
deter]{.mark} an air or covert campaign, [they might]{.mark} choose to
[close off]{.mark} the strait. [**Temporarily** disrupting]{.mark} the
flow of oil, [**even intermittently**, could **rapidly** create a
global]{.mark} economic [crisis given]{.mark} the [**fragility** of
the]{.mark} world [economy]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### [Scenario 2 is Yemen:]{.underline}

#### Arms embargos block Saudi's warfare in Yemen\-\--anything else isn't enough to reform Saudis behaviors

[**Threatening support** for Saudi Arabia's war machine can serve a
variety of purposes. First, such levers present a potentially
significant stick and carrot for achieving policy goals that are broader
than the Yemen war]{.underline}. As Senator Macro Rubio stated earlier
this month on CNN's State of the Union, "Arm sales are important, not
because of the money, but because [it also provides leverage over their
future behavior....They will need our spare parts. They will need our
training. And those are things we can use to influence their
behavior."]{.underline} Options 1-3 can also help curtail Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman's misadventures, if not his leadership of the Saudi
government itself. Bruce Riedel, who served as senior adviser on South
Asia and the Middle East to the last four presidents, explained in a
recent essay, "Responsibility for the war is on Mohammed bin Salman, who
as defense minister has driven Riyadh into this quagmire. [Shaking the
arms relationship is by far **the most important way** to clip his
wings."]{.underline} A former Obama official said as well, ["The message
needs to be that the relationship is being frozen unless MBS moves
aside]{.underline}. [What Yemen and the Gulf crisis and Khashoggi affair
have clarified is that MBS has allows personal pique and vendettas to
override any impulse to reform.]{.underline} He has made the region an
even more dangerous place, and, left to his own devices, is very likely
to drag us into regional conflict. So I would pursue 4 and 2, with the
former underscoring our message that MBS needs to step aside, and the
latter grounding their Air Force, to both add internal pressure on MBS
and to pressure the Saudis to negotiate a resolution to Yemen." Options
1-3 can, indeed, serve purposes specific to the Yemen War, including
distancing the United States from support for Saudi crimes and
encouraging the Saudis and United Arab Emirates to finally bring the war
to a close through political negotiations. In a New Yorker Radio Hour
interview with David Remnick back in March, Riedel explained, "[The
United States is not a direct party to the war, but **we are an enabler
of the war**. If the United States decided today that it was going to
cut off supplies, spare parts, munitions, intelligence, and everything
else to the Royal Saudi Airforce, **it would be grounded
tomorrow."**]{.underline} One former senior official suggested tying arm
sales to different sets of purposes, "I think [Congress should pause all
FMS and end other support to the Saudi campaign in Yemen.]{.underline}
Resumption of arms sales should be conditioned on Riyadh agreeing to a
fully transparent international investigation into the Khashoggi
incident, regular intelligence community assessments of Saudi efforts to
reduce civilian casualties in Yemen, and a report from the
administration outlining their strategy for addressing the humanitarian
crisis in Yemen and producing a peaceful settlement." Another former
[senior official supported]{.underline} **[a clean break]{.underline}**
[from U.S. support for the Yemen war rather than a piecemeal approach.
"On Yemen, the best move would be to]{.underline} support the
Khanna-Murphy War Powers resolution. A clean [end to US military support
for the]{.underline} Saudi-UAE [war in Yemen is better than more
targeted efforts to police that support]{.underline} (like the bar on
in-flight refueling). Suspending existing DCS licenses and [**placing
limits on future foreign military sales** for things like air-to-ground
strike capabilities would be a]{.underline} natural [supplement to this
approach]{.underline}," the former official said. Jeffrey Prescott, who
served as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for
Iran, Iraq, Syria, and the Gulf States on the National Security Council
and now a strategic consultant to the Penn Biden Center expressed a
similar perspective, "My view is that [the callous murder of Mr.
Khashoggi --- and the Trump administration's clear impulse to sweep it
under the rug --- demonstrates how far the relationship with Saudi
Arabia has **gotten off track**, and the need for **serious
consequences**.]{.underline} As a start, [we could use this
moment]{.underline} [to **extricate ourselves** from military
involvement in the disastrous war in Yemen,]{.underline} a step that is
long overdue. Ideally we would simultaneously help push for a diplomatic
resolution of the conflict -- necessary, not easy, and very unlikely
given how little effort the Trump administration has put into serious
diplomacy. But washing our hands of involvement in the war, even in the
absence of a US diplomatic push, will still put pressure on UAE and
Saudi to end the conflict." [Professor Mohamad Bazzi]{.underline}, who
is writing a book on proxy wars between Saudi Arabia and Iran, [had a
similar assessment of the effectiveness of suspending US military
support as a means to effectuate a resolution to the
conflict]{.underline}. Bazzi told me, "Together, actions 1, 2, and 3
(likely in that order of effectiveness) would go significantly beyond
the Obama administration's freeze on the sale of precision-guided
munitions to Riyadh in late 2016. [They would signal to the Saudis and
Emiratis that US military assistance will now truly become **contingent
on progress** in political negotiations.]{.underline} I suspect that's
the [only way Saudi]{.underline} and UAE leaders can [be convinced to
pursue a political settlement, which the Trump administration
agrees]{.underline} (at least rhetorically) is [the path to ending this
war]{.underline}." Notably, in my interviews with former U.S.
officials[, suspension of in-flight refueling (option 3) was generally
considered a weak measure on its own, treated as a supplement or
afterthought to other measures. That may be due to the percentage of
Saudi aircraft that actually depend on such refueling and the Saudis'
ability to replace U.S. in-air refueling with other
substitutes]{.underline}. Concerns about the utility of option 3 as a
pressure point is especially important because it is the only measure
that's triggered by section 1290 of the McCain National Defense
Authorization Act if the Secretary of State fails to certify that the
Saudis are taking appropriate steps to reduce civilian casualties in
Yemen.

In a May 24 letter, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo notified
congressional leaders of the emergency declaration, waiving
congressional review of the weapon sales. Mr. Pompeo said he took into
account "political, military, economic, human rights and arms control
considerations." The State Department on Monday disclosed more details
to Congress, including the nature of the arms sales. "[If Saudi Arabia
is able to develop an indigenous bomb-making capability as a result of
this deal]{.underline}, [it will undermine U.S. leverage to prevent them
from engaging in indiscriminate strikes of the kind it has carried out
in Yemen]{.underline}," said William D. Hartung, director of the Arms
and Security Project at the Center for International Policy, a think
tank. The authorization paperwork signed by Mr. Pompeo offers no
timeline for the shared operations to get underway, and Raytheon
representatives have said they are still negotiating over details with
the Saudi government, according to a congressional aide. [Aside
from]{.underline} potentially [providing the Saudis with more bombs to
use in Yemen airstrikes, the arrangement raised security
concerns]{.underline} among lawmakers, who were seeking assurances [that
the Saudis could prevent the American technology from falling into the
wrong hands.]{.underline} Both Republicans and Democrats also noted that
it called for creating manufacturing jobs in Saudi Arabia that might
otherwise have been located in the United States. And [they expressed
worry that the Saudis might eventually copy the technology and use it to
produce their own weapons, which they would be free to use in Yemen or
sell to whomever they chose]{.underline}.

Authorization Act (NDAA).]{.underline} The US is fueling the world's
largest humanitarian crisis The Trump administration could not make its
priorities more clear: pick friends and sell them weapons, as many as
possible, no matter the consequences for people who will suffer the
fallout. The real [**emergency is** the millions of Yemenis]{.underline}
[who are]{.underline} still [suffering from hunger]{.underline} [and a
broken economy]{.underline}. Over four years of [war]{.underline} have
[left]{.underline} too many [families struggling to
survive]{.underline}. [Disease continues to spread rapidly]{.underline},
[with]{.underline} the world's [largest recorded cholera
outbreak]{.underline} devastating families throughout the country. Now
[the **conflict is at a critical juncture**]{.underline}**. [Peace
negotiations]{.underline} are as [fragile]{.underline}** as ever. Oxfam
and other humanitarian organizations are facing huge obstacles to
deliver life-saving aid that is desperately needed in hard-to-reach
communities. [Powerful states]{.underline} [must demand]{.underline} [a
political agreement]{.underline} [for the millions of Yemenis trapped in
the conflict.]{.underline} The kind of arms ban that will matter A
[bipartisan group of Senators]{.underline} has [introduced
legislation]{.underline} [to block]{.underline} President
[Trump's]{.underline} recently announced [arms sales]{.underline}, but
it faces a likely presidential veto. Even if it could overcome a veto,
it will not stop the billions of dollars worth of bombs, tanks, and
other military equipment that Congress approved in past years and which
are already scheduled for delivery. In short, while standing up to
President Trump's recently announced arms sales will call needed
attention to the issue here in the US, it won't convince anyone fighting
in Yemen to pursue peace with any greater urgency. [The most powerful
way for Congress]{.underline} **[to stand up for Yemen]{.underline}**
[is to]{.underline} simply [**suspend the transfer of weapons** to
Saudi]{.underline}- and Emirati-led [coalition]{.underline} countries in
the upcoming NDAA, a law that Congress passes each year to outline the
budget and expenditures of the US Department of Defense. To be precise,
the arms sale suspension in the NDAA should include the following
elements: It should be long enough to matter (ideally two years); It
should be unconditional and without any presidential waiver with respect
to aerial bombs, which have been consistently used in violation of the
law of war; If other weapons (other than aerial bombs) are conditioned,
they should be conditioned on progress toward a political settlement and
support for the economy and aid delivery; It should apply to all member
countries in the Saudi- and Emirati-led coalition; and It should apply
to all transfers of arms, even those already licensed. This approach
actually enjoys broad support. The Saudi Arabia Accountability and Yemen
Act, introduced by senior Democrats and Republicans in the Senate,
includes an arms transfer suspension with almost all of these elements
(it applies only to Saudi Arabia, not other members of the Saudi- and
Emirati-led coalition). Congress is poised to act---if our leaders are
focused and brave It's likely that majorities would vote for a strong
arms sale ban in both the House and Senate---but Congressional leaders
may not give them the chance. Instead, rather than take on the arms
industry and President Trump, they may try to include weaker arms
transfer language that will be easy for the Trump administration and the
parties fighting in Yemen to ignore. In the Senate, Foreign Relations
Chairman Jim Risch (R-ID) and Armed Services Committee Chairman Jim
Inhofe (R-NE) have indicated they oppose blocking the Trump
administration's arms sales and would prefer a softer touch to Yemen. In
the House, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-NY) and
Ranking Member Michael McCaul (R-TX) are working on Yemen-related
legislation that they may propose adding to the NDAA, but it remains to
be seen whether they will support strong action. The support of Rep.
Adam Smith (D-WA) will be critical for a strong suspension to move
forward. Ironically, the House's Democratic leaders, who [vocally
championed the Yemen War Powers
Resolution](https://adamsmith.house.gov/2018/9/hasc-ranking-member-adam-smith-rep-ro-khanna-cpc-co-chair-mark-pocan-0)
that President Trump vetoed this Spring, have not yet stated their
support for a strict approach to arms transfers. But it's worth
remembering that many of those same leaders only committed to the War
Powers Resolution following substantial public demand. [A]{.underline}n
unconditional [ban on bomb transfers]{.underline}---the kinds of
[weapons that are most likely to be put to use to destroy schools,
hospitals, and family homes]{.underline}---will only become law if House
and Senate leaders make it a top priority in the NDAA. But in full view
of the Trump administration's morally bankrupt Yemen policy---and
following [Democratic
promises](https://www.majorityleader.gov/content/hoyer-statement-arms-sales-saudi-arabia-and-united-arab-emirates)
[to right that
wrong](https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/2019/5/engel-statement-on-arms-sales)---we
cannot demand anything less.

**Technology Wire 19** \[CNN interview with Chris Murphy and an in-depth
story covering the war in Yemen by CNN's Nima Elbagir who traveled
throughout Yemen, "U.S. Weapons Falling into Wrong Hands, Devastation
Left in Yemen; Lawmakers Renew Efforts to End American Military Support
for Saudi-Led Coalition in Yemen", February 5, 2019, Interview with Sen.
Chris Murphy (D-CT). Aired 1:30-2p ET, DOA: 6/8/19 GMDI

BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: [U.S. lawmakers]{.underline} [are
renewing]{.underline} their [efforts]{.underline} to pass a war powers
resolution through Congress in an attempt [to end American military
support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen]{.underline}. As the U.S.
government grapples with its entanglement in Yemen\'s civilwar, CNN\'s
Nima Elbagir has been following the trail of U.S. weaponry and the
devastation left in their wake. After CNN presented its findings, a U.S.
Defense official told CNN exclusively that an investigation into
violations of U.S. arms agreements by coalition partners is ongoing.
This is Nima\'s exclusive report, \"Made in America, Lost in Yemen.\"
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT
(voice-over):[Shells of millions of dollars-worth of abandoned American
armored vehicles litter the roads]{.underline}. [Welcome to **Yemen**
where]{.underline} [**weapons** made in American is
**sold**]{.underline}**, [stolen and abandoned and making its way into
the wrong hands]{.underline}**[.]{.underline} **UNIDENTIFIED TV
ANNOUCER:** M-ATV defense. (GUNFIRE) **ELBAGIR:** We\'re here to trail
of those weapons and the chaos they have left behind. Our journey starts
at the front lines where a cease-fire was recently assigned. Climbing up
a defensive berm for a better look, the Houthi position, we\'re told, is
only around 200 to 300 meters away. **UNIDENTIFIED MALE:** (SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE) **ELBAGIR:** That movement there on the horizon. Did
you hear that? Get down. (GUNFIRE) **ELBAGIR:** There. Another shot
that\'s coming from over there. They want to take us to the actual
position. They want to show us the cease-fire violations. (CROSSTALK)
**ELBAGIR:** (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (CROSSTALK) ELBAGIR (on
camera): So they\'re now firing on us. You can hear it. I can hear a
musa that\'s incoming. (GUNFIRE) **ELBAGIR:** It\'s getting heavier and
we\'re told we have to leave. Even as we are driving away, even now you
can hear that. It\'s getting much, much heavier. (SPEAKING FOREIGN
LANGUAGE) (voice-over): [The **influx of weaponry is prolonging the
conflict**.]{.underline} On our way back from the front line, we spot
what we\'ve come in search of. (on camera): It\'s absolutely incredible
**[driving past]{.underline}**, and [it\'s like a graveyard of American
military]{.underline} [hardware]{.underline}. And [this is not under the
control of coalition forces.]{.underline} [This is in the command of
militias]{.underline}. \[13:35:09\] (voice-over): Which is expressly
forbidden by the arms sales agreement with the U.S. [On the outside
of]{.underline} these [mine-resistant armored vehicles]{.underline},
[MRAPs, there are stickers proudly proclaiming them as property of a
militia allied to the coalition]{.underline}. [We zero in on the serial
numbers, tracing them back to U.S. manufacturer, Navistar, the largest
provider of armed vehicles for the U.S. Army.]{.underline}
**UNIDENTIFIED MALE:** (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) **ELBAGIR:** We\'re
told to stop filming. **UNIDENTIFIED MALE:** (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
**ELBAGIR:** But we\'re able to find another vehicle. This one even has
the export sticker, from Beaumont, Texas, to Abu Dhabi in the United
Emirates. (SHOUTING) **ELBAGIR:** As we arrive back in town, we pass yet
another militia-heldMRAP. Everywhere we look, it seems, it\'s made in
the USA. (SHOUTING)ELBAGIR: Yemen is split between warring factions,
U.S.-backed and Saudi-led in the country\'s south, Iranian-backed Houthi
militias in the north. We can\'t cross front lines to go north, but the
MRAPs have. Captured by Iran\'s allies, the Houthis. (SHOUTING)
**ELBAGIR:** To the backdrop of chants to \"death of America, this
U.S.MRAP was broadcast on a Houthi-backed channel with Mohammad Ali
Houthi(ph), the deputy leader, sitting behind the wheel. CNN was able to
obtain the serial number from one of the Houthi-held MRAPs and verified
that it was part of the \$2.5 billion 2014 U.S. sale to the UAE, a
coalition partner. So why does it matter? Because these very [**MRAPs**
and others like them have]{.underline} already, we\'re told, [**fallen
into** the hands of **Iranian intelligence**]{.underline}. [In
an]{.underline} audio [interview with a member of a secret Houthi
unit]{.underline} of the Preventative Security Force, [CNN was told some
U.S. military technology has already been transferred to
Iran]{.underline}. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation): [Iranian
intelligence are assessing U.S. technology very closely]{.underline}.
There isn\'t a single American weapon that they don\'t try to find out
its details, what it\'s made of,how it works. **ELBAGIR:** [Advanced
improvised explosive devices with Iranian components are now
mass-produced by Houthi forces]{.underline} on a scale only previously
achieved by ISIS. And [the U.S.\'s first line of defense against IEDs,
the MRAP, has been compromised]{.underline}. The Houthi leadership
denied to CNN the existence of the Preventative Security Force. CNN has
also reached out to Iran for comment but received no response.
Regardless, at the very least, [these high-profile captures of American
hardware make them safer and harder to fight.]{.underline} (EXPLOSION)
(CROSSTALK) **ELBAGIR:** Our next stop is the mountain city of Baz (ph),
where we\'re told an Iran-linked militia is in possession of American
weaponry. In these images obtained by CNN, you see the Abalabas militia,
founded by and funded by Abalabas (ph), on the U.S. terror list, proudly
patrolling the streets of Baz (ph) in U.S. MRAPs. If that wasn\'t
unsettling enough, Baz (ph), as we learned, is also a wash with
weaponry. **UNIDENTIFIED MALE:** (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
**ELBAGIR:** [Arms markets are illegal]{.underline} in Yemen, [but that
hasn\'t stopped them from operating]{.underline}. **UNIDENTIFIED MALE:**
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) **ELBAGIR:** Using undercover cameras, we
are able to film arms sellers hidden amid women\'s clothing shops. He
doesn\'t today, but we\'re told we can put in a special order for an
American assault rifle. [Sellers like these are driving a black market
for high-tech American weapons]{.underline}. And that\'s just the tip of
iceberg. **UNIDENTIFIED MALE:** (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) **ELBAGIR:**
CNN was told by coalition forces that a deadlier U.S. weapon system, the
TOW missile, was air dropped in 2015 by Saudi Arabia to Yemeni forces,
an air drop that was proudly proclaimed across Saudi-backed media
channels. Where were they used and by whom? We try to find out. (on
camera): Yes, can you hear me? **UNIDENTIFIED MALE:** (INAUDIBLE)
**ELBAGIR:** Yes. **UNIDENTIFIED MALE:** (INAUDIBLE) **ELBAGIR:** OK.
We\'ve been told we can\'t go ahead with the interviews we had
preplanned. This local government is under the head of the coalition and
they are completely blocking our contacts or any of our ability to do
any work. (voice-over): The intimidation continued throughout that day
and into the night. Ultimately, we\'re chased out of town. \[13:40:00\]
But [we still want to find out what happened to the TOWs. We ask the
U.S. Department of Defense whether they knew what happened to the U.S.
anti-tank missiles. They said that despite Saudi TV coverage, they
weren\'t even aware of the claim that the kingdom of Saudi Arabia used
TOW anti-tank missiles in Yemen]{.underline} in October 2015.After CNN
presented its findings to the DOD, it says it has now launched an
investigation. The Saudi-led coalition has not responded to calls for
comment but a senior UAE official denied to CNN that they were in
violation of the arms sales agreement, saying, \"The Giants Brigade are
part of Yemeni forces that fight the Houthis on the ground and are under
our direct supervision.\" The U.S. DOD statement to CNN added, \"They
did not authorize any transfer of MRAPs or any military hardware from
Saudi Arabia or the UAE to third parties.\" So far, we\'ve focused on
the weapons fueling the war here. (CROSSTALK) **ELBAGIR:** But the
seemingly endless conflict they sustain has also sparked a manmade
catastrophe. Just a short distance from the front lines, the human toll
comes into full view. (CROSSTALK) ELBAGIR (on camera): This is Bashai,
and she is so malnourished, she can\'t walk. Her mother has to carry her
everywhere. There are 200 cases of malnutrition, like Bashai, just in
this one village. (voice-over): The local clinic had to shut down, so
when word that the doctor is here gets around, parents come out into the
street to meet her. Lola is 14 months old but looks far smaller.
(CRYING) **ELBAGIR:** After the doctor finishes her checkup, her father
takes us deeper into the village to meet other families. (on camera):
This is Rehab. She\'s two years old and she is so severely malnourished
that her chest has begun to cave in. But incredibly, this is Rehab after
she started getting better. The doctors said they have been able to get
her to keep some of the nutrition in, and they\'re actually hopeful now.
(voice-over): That hope, though, depends on peace. And what we\'ve seen
here doesn\'t give much hope of a lasting one. [How easy it is to get
your hands on high-tech U.S. weapons]{.underline}. [How a swamp of
uneasy alliances has **led to sensitive U.S. weaponry** **ending up in
both Iranian and al Qaeda-linked hands**]{.underline}. How America\'s
allies are making Americans less safe. Wherever or with whomever the
weapons end up, the war goes on. And ultimately, it\'s the people here
who, as ever, bear the brunt. Nima Elbagir, CNN, Al-Bayda (ph) Province.
(END VIDEOTAPE) **KEILAR:** U.S. weapon manufacturer, Navistar, did not
respond to CNN\'s request for comment. These U.S. arms sales are legally
process and sanctioned by the U.S. government. And CNN\'s exclusive
report has now gotten the attention of American lawmakers. At least one
Senator now calling for the U.S. to end its involvement in the Yemen
civil war. We have Senator Chris Murphy, along with Nima Elbagir, who
had that exclusive report, joining us live, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
\[13:48:10\] KEILAR: A member of the Senate Armed Services Committee is
calling for an end to U.S. involvement in the war in Yemen. This push
from Senator Chris Murphy is coming on the heels of an exclusive CNN
report, \"U.S. Weapons Sold to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates
Following into the Hands of Militias Linked to Iran and alQaeda.\" The
head of the U.S. Central Command was asked about the situation ata
hearing today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) **GEN. JOSEPH VOTEL, COMMANDER, U.S.
ARMY CENTRAL COMMAND:** We have not authorized Saudi Arabia or the
Emirates to retransfer any of this equipment to other parties on the
ground in Yemen. I think we have to look more closely at the allegations
in this particular situation to find out what happened. As we\'ve seen
in Iraq in the past, where we saw our partners overrun, we have seen
American equipment provided to them, lost in the course of a fight, end
up in the hands of our adversaries out there. And so I think we have to
examine that better. (END VIDEO CLIP) **KEILAR:** Senator Chris Murphy
is with us from Capitol Hill. CNN\'sNima Elbagir is in London with more
on her exclusive reporting. Senator, when you heard this CNN that Nima
had on CNN, what did you think? SEN. CHRIS MURPHY, (D), CONNECTICUT:
It\'s infuriating but not surprising. [There\'s a long history of the
United States sending very complicated, very lethal weapons into chaotic
war zones and those weapons ending up in the hands of our
enemies]{.underline}. Just recently, a few years ago, when we were
trying to train a whole bunch of so-called moderate rebels inside Syria,
many of the weapons we gave them ended up in the hands of those they
were supposed to be fight, groups connected to ISIS. This is predictable
and it\'s why many of us have been advocating for years for the United
States to get out of the civil war inside Yemen. [Our support for the
Saudis has been allowing them to intentionally kill civilians. And now
we find out fairly definitively that the weapons we have been giving the
Saudis are ending up in very conservative, very radical Sunni militias
that may end up using those weapons against the United States and our
allies]{.underline}. \[13:50:21\] KEILAR: Nima, you\'ve been, with this
reporting, in a unique position of knowing more than the U.S. government
does about where its weapons are ending up. What did you think about how
Capitol Hill is responding to your report? ELBAGIR: To General Votel\'s
point where he describes weapons being given to allies ending up in a
conflict situation in the hands of enemies, that\'s not what happened
here. These were weapons that were knowingly transferred from the United
Arab Emirates, that they admit to knowingly transferring to groups under
the coalition\'s aegis. Saudi Arabia publicly announce it had on
Saudi-backed media channels in addition to what we heard from coalition
sources. [They publicly announced that they were air dropping \-- which
is incredibly irresponsible. That\'s not a mechanism that you have a lot
of control over. They were air dropping antitank missiles with a
three-kilometer radius to a military front that includes an al
Qaeda-linked group.]{.underline} Where this seems to be breaking down is
that the United Arab Emirates, as they see it, believe that they have
the right to transfer this weaponry, even though the United States has
been pretty categoric that they do not \-- Brianna? **KEILAR:** Senator,
what do you say to that? What can Congress do? That\'s on outstanding
point that Nima makes. This isn\'t as General Votel describes it. [This
is knowingly being transferred in violation of these armed sales
agreements.]{.underline} **MURPHY:** We have raised these concerns with
the administration before. We have known for a long time that the Saudis
and UAE have created coalitions with very dangerous militias on the
ground inside Yemen. This is not news to the administration. Many of us
are worried about those groups that are inside the Saudi-led coalition.
But the Saudis also have been violating the rules of conflicts for years
now. When they use our bombs, they\'re not supposed to intentionally
drop them on civilians, and yet we have all sort of good reporting from
inside Yemen to show they\'ve been using U.S.-made bombs, U.S.-made
targeting systems, U.S. refueling planes to intentionally attack
civilian targets. And so it is also not as if our military didn\'t have
notice that the Saudis have in the past violated the conditions of our
alliance, so this should not be surprising to them given that history.
**KEILAR:** How do you deal with this, Senator, when we\'ve seen the
administration, the president in particular, rhetorically and in very
real ways, be soft on Saudi Arabia, for instance. What is \-- what can
be done aside from the administration where we\'re seeing this reticence
to be tough on the Saudis? **MURPHY:** Congress can pull the United
States out of this civil war. And in a few weeks, we will offer a
resolution on the floor of the Senate to do that, which will likely get
the majority of Senators voting in favor of it, Democrats and
Republicans. The House will take up that resolution. It will have a
majority of the House as well. The president may still veto that
resolution, but that doesn\'t mean that Congress shouldn\'t exercise our
responsibility to be a co-equal branch with the president in setting
foreign policy. As the reporting shows, the danger of staying in this
civil war is not just that [more military hardware will be transferred
to dangerous militias]{.underline}, it\'s that we will continue to be
part of a war that is creating a humanitarian catastrophe that\'s
already resulted in 85,000 little kids dying of starvation or disease.
Congress has got to take a vote to pull us out of this war. KEILAR:
Nima, your report was \-- it took us right to that point that the
Senator is talking about, to see these children who \-- they look\--
they look younger than they are because they\'re so malnourished, and it
is heartbreaking in the story you tell. What needs to be done to stem
this humanitarian crisis? **ELBAGIR:** Well, everyone we\'ve spoken to
on the ground is clear on one point, they need a real cease-fire. [And
the problem, is **when you have so many parties to the conflict
empowered by this easy access to weaponry**, **it\'s very difficult to
police a cease-fire**]{.underline}. And that is what needs to happen.
The parties to the conflict, even on a higher-level, I.E., the
coalition, they need to deliver on their promises to get aid to some of
these areas cut off by the fighting. And we saw very little evidence of
that on the ground \-- Brianna?

[The failure of states in the Middle East]{.underline} since the Arab
Spring [poses]{.underline} greater and more **[immediate
threats]{.underline}** to U.S. security. An imperfect but decent proxy
for the amount of state failure in the international system is [the
number of ongoing civil wars]{.underline}. This number [increased
steadily]{.underline} from the end of the World War II to the early
1990s, when it reached a remarkably high level following the collapse of
the Soviet Union. At that time almost three in ten countries with a
population greater than half a million was experiencing a civil conflict
that had killed at least 1,000 people. Total deaths were substantially
greater in a large majority of these---median total deaths for wars in
progress in 1994 were at least 30,000. Since the mid 1990s we see some
decline and a leveling out, despite the outbreak of several large-scale
conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Quite a few civil
wars, many of them long running, ended in the second half of the 1990s,
in Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, and sub-Saharan Africa (though
almost as many started in the late 90s in Africa). Since 9/11 and the
Arab Spring, however, **[new state failures have been concentrated in
the MENA region]{.underline}**, [with dramatic instances in Iraq, Syria,
Libya, and Yemen]{.underline}. Three of these were middle-income
countries not too long ago. Syria and Iraq had developed business
sectors. Iraq, Syria, and Libya had all attempted nuclear weapons
programs, with various degrees of competence. [Although civil wars are
not new to this region]{.underline} -- or to these states, excepting
Libya---**[the degree of state collapse]{.underline}** [is of a whole
new order in all of them.]{.underline} Further, [the prospects for **a
return of stable central control in Syria and Iraq**]{.underline} [do
not seem good. State collapse and failure in this region is]{.underline}
much more **[consequential for]{.underline}** U.S. economic and
**[security interests]{.underline}** than in sub-Saharan Africa because
[it raises the risk of **a spread of civil wars and state failures to
other states in the region**]{.underline} [that are important
for]{.underline} regional and **[international
stability]{.underline}**---[Lebanon, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain,
Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, and Pakistan]{.underline}. [Refugees put
direct]{.underline} [strains on neighboring]{.underline} [states'
**economies**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[political
balances]{.underline}**. [Regional conflict over the failed states
**increases militarization**]{.underline}, **[cross-border support for
insurgents]{.underline}** or opposition movements in regional
adversaries, [and risks of]{.underline} regional **[interstate military
conflicts]{.underline}** ([including]{.underline}, to give just one
example, [more war between **Israel and Hezbollah**]{.underline} in
Lebanon[). State failure encourages the **transnational jihadi
movement**]{.underline}, [gives it **recruits and
training**]{.underline}, [some of whom will return to plot attacks in
their home countries and perhaps in Western countries as
well]{.underline}. And [all this takes place in a region with states
that **have the capability**]{.underline} (before they suffer major
failure or collapse) **[to mount serious nuclear weapons
programs]{.underline}**, [or to **purchase** weapons]{.underline}. A
major driver of the spread of state failure in this region is the
stunning success of the transnational movement of violent jihadis. This
is a movement explicitly aimed at producing state failure of U.N. member
states whose rulers are seen as beholden to the U.S., Europe, and an
infidel-run international system. The popularity of the movement among
young Muslim men has the effect of rendering all states in the region
more brittle. [Any shock to the capabilities of a state's coercive
apparatus relative to potential armed challengers is much more likely to
develop into a civil war]{.underline}, because the [movement makes it
much more possible for would-be rebel groups to get past a threshold of
military viability]{.underline}. As long as this movement inspires a
high degree of passion and attracts funds from some wealthy state and
non-state supporters, the risks of continued state failure will be
significant in this important area. **[The U.S. does not have the
capabilities it needs to deal with failed states]{.underline}**, in the
sense of bringing them out of failure. But it is not clear that any
third party does. **[Political order has to be built by
locals.]{.underline}** There have been circumstances, such as in Germany
and Japan immediately after World War II, when U.S. support could make a
big difference for state building in the aftermath of state failure (of
a sort). But these circumstances appear to be unusual and do not obtain
in the post-colonial world and present international system. [U.S. state
building interventions have **failed**]{.underline}, for similar core
reasons, [in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan.]{.underline}
[Counterinsurgency by a foreign power is basically "**shuffling the deck
chairs**]{.underline}," unless the supported government is highly
capable -- and if it were, we would not need to intervene heavily in the
first place. The U.S. probably does have policy instruments that can
lower the risk of contagion of state failure, if skillfully applied. But
as I suggested in the last memo, [there is a moral hazard problem that
is very tricky]{.underline}. In many areas, **[the more we do, the less
the governments whose states we aim to shore up do.]{.underline}**
[Unstable, coup-prone regimes have an aversion to developing strong,
capability militaries, and would rather rely on foreign
strength.]{.underline} **[Further, the more we do, the more we play into
the hands of the transnational movement and help them to
recruit.]{.underline}**

[With the administration]{.underline} firmly [behind]{.underline} its
[Saudi and Emirati allies]{.underline}, [Congress offers the best hope
to end]{.underline} [the]{.underline} American role in a
[war]{.underline} that has triggered one of the world's worst
humanitarian crises. In early April, the House voted to cease military
support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, finally approving a bill
to restrain presidential war powers that has taken years to pass both
chambers of Congress. On 16 April, Trump vetoed the bill. Two weeks
later, the bill's supporters in the Senate tried to override the veto
but fell short, 53-45. (It takes two-thirds of the Senate, or 67 votes,
to override a presidential veto.) But the measure was still a turning
point because it focused attention on the extent and unpopularity of
military support for Saudi Arabia and its allies. As the political
jockeying unfolded in Washington, the [United Nations Development
Programme]{.underline} [issued a report underscoring the extent of the
humanitarian disaster being fueled by US weapons and logistical
support]{.underline}. The report warned that [the death toll in Yemen
could rise to 233,000]{.underline} by the end of 2019 -- [far higher
than previous estimates.]{.underline} (The projection includes an
estimate of 102,000 deaths from combat and 131,000 indirect deaths due
to the lack of food, health crises like a cholera epidemic and damage to
Yemen's infrastructure.) "The current conflict in [Yemen is one of the

#### Stabilizing Yemen prevents Iran from establishing a foothold there, and stops it from becoming a terrorist breeding ground for Al-Qaeda

Stopping the Yemen War The ongoing war in Yemen is an extension of the
security scenario in which Saudi Arabia needs to contain an Iranian
threat. If an alternative strategy were conceivable, [Saudi Arabia could
free up public funds for other purposes and avoid the war\'s collateral
damage]{.underline}, [horrific suffering and destruction]{.underline}.
Although the issues of the conflict seem intractable, during my recent
talks in Riyadh I learned of a [parallel Saudi policy, building working
relationships with all parties to the conflict for alleviating suffering
through humanitarian
relief]{.underline}.[**34**](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.mutex.gmu.edu/doi/10.1111/mepo.12367#mepo12367-note-0034_34)
It is a two‐pronged strategy: waging war against the Houthis while
building a working relationship with them to alleviate suffering.
Because the war has failed to produce the intended results, an
alternative strategy of building working relationships holds more
promise. There are several sound reasons, in addition to cutting
expenses and putting an end to human suffering, for building on these
relationships to broker a political solution: The Houthis would need to
form part of any conceivable coalition in Yemen if it is to be
sustainable. Iranian influence --- by way of what the Saudis during my
recent talks denoted the *Hezbollah Model* --- is not the cause of the
conflict. To the contrary, [it is the conflict that enables Iran to
establish a presence]{.underline}. In the Saudi view, the Hezbollah
Model denotes Iran\'s use of militias to undermine negotiated power
sharing, as they do in Lebanon. [Conflict enables the Hezbollah
Model.]{.underline} [Brokering a political deal with the Houthis
would]{.underline}, in other words, both [stop the war and put an end to
Iranian
influence]{.underline}.[35](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.mutex.gmu.edu/doi/10.1111/mepo.12367#mepo12367-note-0035_35)
(In fact, Hezbollah itself is the direct unintended consequence of a
far‐reaching Israeli miscalculation, the invasion of Lebanon in 1982
that had the effect of enabling Iran to establish its presence by proxy
in the window of opportunity Israel created. Actually, the scheming of
one man, Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, forcing the hand of a wiser
government majority against him, led to the ill‐advised
invasion.[36](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.mutex.gmu.edu/doi/10.1111/mepo.12367#mepo12367-note-0036_36))
The Hezbollah Model is, for all practical purposes, operated by the
Al‐Quds Brigade, the branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards for
foreign operations. This represents one among several competing
political factions in
Iran.[37](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.mutex.gmu.edu/doi/10.1111/mepo.12367#mepo12367-note-0037_37)
Therefore, Saudi Arabia could also contain the Hezbollah Model in Yemen
by building alliances with other Iranian factions, such as Foreign
Minister Javad Zarif. [Without war, Al‐Qaeda]{.underline}, which in the
early 2000s posed such a terrorist threat in Saudi Arabia from its haven
in Yemen, [would lose its current political platform]{.underline}: [its
hybrid role of terrorists‐turned‐semi‐co‐combatants against the Houthis,
legitimizing themselves there]{.underline}, [as they try to do in Syria,
by a popular‐front strategy of seeming to be absorbed into a broad
political movement]{.underline}. Finally, the sooner the war in Yemen is
stopped, the sooner Saudi Arabia can halt the dangerous disintegration
of its "soft underbelly" into chaos. With a population comparable to
that of Saudi Arabia, [Yemen\'s turning into a "new Somalia" would pose
an almost unimaginable security threat]{.underline}. The war in Yemen
will effectively block the necessary enabling external environment. One
casualty is the investment climate. To overcome this obstacle, bold
moves are imperative.

#### Terrorism causes extinction- it ensures nuclear retaliation

**Ayson 10** - Professor of Strategic Studies and Director of the Centre
for Strategic Studies: New Zealand at the Victoria University of
Wellington (Robert, July. "After a Terrorist Nuclear Attack: Envisaging
Catalytic Effects." Studies in Conflict & Terrorism, Vol. 33, Issue 7.
InformaWorld.)

But these two nuclear worlds---a non-state actor nuclear attack and a
catastrophic interstate nuclear exchange---are not necessarily
separable. It is just possible that [some sort of terrorist
attack]{.underline}, and especially an act of nuclear terrorism, [could
precipitate a chain of events leading to a massive exchange of nuclear
weapons between two or more]{.underline} of the [states]{.underline}
that possess them. In this context, today's and tomorrow's terrorist
groups might assume the place allotted during the early Cold War years
to new state possessors of small nuclear arsenals who were seen as
[raising the risks of a **catalytic nuclear war** between the
superpowers started by third parties]{.underline}. These risks were
considered in the late 1950s and early 1960s as concerns grew about
nuclear proliferation, the so-called n+1 problem. It may require a
considerable amount of imagination to depict an especially plausible
situation where an act of nuclear terrorism could lead to such a massive
inter-state nuclear war. For example, in the event of a terrorist
nuclear attack on the United States, it might well be wondered just how
Russia and/or China could plausibly be brought into the picture, not
least because they seem unlikely to be fingered as the most obvious
state sponsors or encouragers of terrorist groups. They would seem far
too responsible to be involved in supporting that sort of terrorist
behavior that could just as easily threaten them as well. Some
possibilities, however remote, do suggest themselves. For example, how
might the United States react if it was thought or discovered that the
fissile material used in the act of nuclear terrorism had come from
Russian stocks,40 and if for some reason Moscow denied any
responsibility for nuclear laxity? The correct attribution of that
nuclear material to a particular country might not be a case of science
fiction given the observation by Michael May et al. that while the
debris resulting from a nuclear explosion would be "spread over a wide
area in tiny fragments, its radioactivity makes it detectable,
identifiable and collectable, and a wealth of information can be
obtained from its analysis: the efficiency of the explosion, the
materials used and, most important ... some indication of where the
nuclear material came from."41 Alternatively, if the act of nuclear
terrorism came as a complete surprise, and American officials refused to
believe that a terrorist group was fully responsible (or responsible at
all) suspicion would shift immediately to state possessors. Ruling out
Western ally countries like the United Kingdom and France, and probably
Israel and India as well, authorities in Washington would be left with a
very short list consisting of North Korea, perhaps Iran if its program
continues, and possibly Pakistan. But [at what stage would Russia and
China be]{.underline} definitely [ruled out]{.underline} in this high
stakes game of nuclear Cluedo? In particular[, if the act]{.underline}
of nuclear terrorism [occurred against a backdrop of existing
tension]{.underline} in Washington's relations [with Russia and/or
China]{.underline}, and at a time when threats had already been traded
between these major powers, [would officials and political leaders not
be tempted to **assume the worst**]{.underline}? Of course, the chances
of this occurring would only seem to increase if the United States was
already involved in some sort of limited armed conflict with Russia
and/or China, or if they were confronting each other from a distance in
a proxy war, as unlikely as these developments may seem at the present
time. The reverse might well apply too: should a nuclear terrorist
attack occur in Russia or China during a period of heightened tension or
even limited conflict with the United States, could Moscow and Beijing
resist the pressures that might rise domestically to consider the United
States as a possible perpetrator or encourager of the attack?
[Washington's early response]{.underline} to a terrorist nuclear attack
on its own soil [might]{.underline} also [raise the possibility of an
unwanted]{.underline} (and nuclear aided) [confrontation]{.underline}
with Russia and/or China. For example, [in the noise and confusion
during the immediate aftermath]{.underline} of the terrorist nuclear
attack, [the U.S. president might be expected to place the
country's]{.underline} armed forces, including its [nuclear arsenal, on
a high]{.underline}er [stage of alert]{.underline}. In such a tense
environment, when careful planning runs up against the friction of
reality, [it is]{.underline} just [possible that Moscow and/or China
might mistakenly read this as a sign of U.S. intention]{.underline}s [to
use force]{.underline} (and possibly nuclear force) against them. In
that situation, the [temptations to preempt]{.underline} such actions
might [grow]{.underline}, although it must be admitted that any
preemption would probably still meet with a devastating response. As
part of its initial response to the act of nuclear terrorism (as
discussed earlier) Washington might decide to order a significant
conventional (or nuclear) retaliatory or disarming attack against the
leadership of the terrorist group and/or states seen to support that
group. Depending on the identity and especially the location of these
targets, Russia and/or China might interpret such action as being far
too close for their comfort, and potentially as an infringement on their
spheres of influence and even on their sovereignty. One far-fetched but
perhaps not impossible scenario might stem from a judgment in Washington
that some of the main aiders and abetters of the terrorist action
resided somewhere such as Chechnya, perhaps in connection with what
Allison claims is the "Chechen insurgents' ... long-standing interest in
all things nuclear."42 American pressure on that part of the world would
almost certainly raise alarms in Moscow that might require a degree of
advanced consultation from Washington that the latter found itself
unable or unwilling to provide. There is also the question of how other
nuclear-armed states respond to the act of nuclear terrorism on another
member of that special club. It could reasonably be expected that
following a nuclear terrorist attack on the United States, bothRussia
and China would extend immediate sympathy and support to Washington and
would work alongside the United States in the Security Council. But
there is just a chance, albeit a slim one, where the support of Russia
and/or China is less automatic in some cases than in others. For
example, what would happen if the United States wished to discuss its
right to retaliate against groups based in their territory? If, for some
reason, Washington found the responses of Russia and China deeply
underwhelming, (neither "for us or against us") might it also suspect
that they secretly were in cahoots with the group, increasing (again
perhaps ever so slightly) the chances of a major exchange. If the
terrorist group had some connections to groups in Russia and China, or
existed in areas of the world over which Russia and China held sway, and
if Washington felt that Moscow or Beijing were placing a curiously
modest level of pressure on them, what conclusions might it then draw
about their culpability.

[Arms embargos are often dismissed as symbolic, and therefore
ineffective]{.underline}. But [just because something is symbolic,
doesn't mean that it won't have an effect]{.underline}. A [U.S. arms
embargo against Saudi Arabia **would be a clear signal** **of American
disproval** of Saudi actions in Yemen, and would be an **equally
important signal to Washington's allies**]{.underline}, [who are left
wondering if the United States is ambivalent or uninterested in the
growing Yemeni humanitarian catastrophe.]{.underline} [By continuing to
provide weapons, President Donald Trump tacitly endorses Saudi
policies.]{.underline} This signal is strengthened by Trump's recent
veto of the resolution that called for an end to U.S. support for the
war in Yemen. While Trump justified the veto by saying that the
resolution was a "dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional
authorities," statements from Congressional representatives show they
are aware of the powerful signals sent by arms sales. Sen. Tim Kaine
said that the veto "shows the world \[Trump\] is determined to keep
aiding a Saudi-backed war that has killed thousands of civilians and
pushed millions more to the brink of starvation." [An arms embargo
against Saudi Arabia would be a signal both to leaders of that country,
and other states, that the United States does not endorse Saudi
actions]{.underline}. [Those arguing against a ban are correct on one
point: Embargos as blunt force instruments of coercion are rarely
effective. But arms embargos are effective **as signals of political
dissatisfaction**, and serve an **important communication role** in
international politics. **Arms Embargos Are Signals and Can Build
Coalitions**]{.underline} Policymakers and scholars agree that arms
embargoes are not effective "sticks" in international politics. Rarely
do states cave when faced with punishment in the form of an embargo. But
even if an arms embargo isn't a direct tool of coercion, an embargo
would be an important political signal. There are at least two reasons
for the United States to seriously consider an arms embargo against
Saudi Arabia. [First, arms sales are signals that cut through the noise
of the international system]{.underline}. [Cutting off arms transfers is
a common way that states express their dissatisfaction with others and
try to influence behavior.]{.underline} As Lawrence Freedman observed in
1978, "refusing to sell arms is a major political act. [It appears as a
calculated insult, reflecting on the stability, trust, and
credit-worthiness, or technical competence of the would-be
recipient."]{.underline} Yet this crucial point seems to have been lost
in the current policy debate about whether or not the United States
should continue selling arms to Saudi Arabia. My research shows that
stopping arms transfers or denying requests is an effective way to
signal dissatisfaction and causes the would-be recipient to re-think
their behavior. [Take, for example, the U.S. relationship with Israel in
the 1960s.]{.underline} The United States sold Israel Hawk
surface-to-surface missiles in 1962, M-48 Patton tanks in 1964 and 1965,
and A-4E Skyhawk bombers in 1966. Israeli leaders understood that these
transfers signaled a close U.S.-Israeli relationship. As diplomat Abba
Eban wrote, the arms transfers were "a development of tremendous
political value." Even against this backdrop of close ties and
significant arms sales, [Israeli leaders were extremely sensitive to
arms transfer denials]{.underline}. In April and May [1967, the United
States denied Israeli requests for armored personnel carriers and
fighter jets]{.underline}. Approving the transfers would have signaled
support, and likely emboldened Israel, as tensions were growing in the
region. [Israeli leaders believed these transfer denials overruled prior
signals and demonstrated that the United States was not willing to be a
close political ally for Israel]{.underline}. [Eban described Israel as
"isolated]{.underline}," and the head of Israel's intelligence service
said that the arms transfer denials made it clear that "in Israel, there
existed certain misperceptions \[about the United States\]." [If arms
transfer denials could have such a significant effect on Israeli
thinking --- keeping in mind that there was a close and significant
political relationship between the US and Israel --- imagine what a
transfer denial would mean for U.S.-Saudi relations]{.underline}. Like
Israel, [Saudi Arabia would have **to re-think its impression** that it
has political support and approval from the United States.]{.underline}
We can, and should, ask whether or not withdrawal of U.S. support would
affect Saudi behavior, but it's important that this question not get
overlooked in the current debate. Because arms transfers (and denials)
are powerful signals, they can have an effect even before a transfer is
actually completed. This suggests that even the announcement of an
embargo against Saudi Arabia could have an effect. Take, for example,
Taiwan's recent request for a fleet of new fighter jets. As reports
mounted that Trump had given "tacit approval" to a deal for F-16 jets,
China's protests increased. The United States has not sold advanced
fighter jets to Taiwan since 1992, partially out of fear of angering
China, which views Taiwan as a renegade province. Even if the deal for
F-16s is formally approved, Taiwan is unlikely to see the jets until at
least 2021, and the balance of power between China and Taiwan would not
change. As one researcher observed, the sale would be a "huge shock" for
Beijing, "But it would be more of a political shock than a military
shock. It would be, 'Oh, the U.S. doesn't care how we feel.' It would be
more of a symbolic or emotional issue." Yet China's immediate, negative
reaction to even the announcement of a potential deal shows how powerful
arms transfer signals can be. If this same logic is applied to an arms
embargo against Saudi Arabia, an arms embargo would signal that Saudi
Arabia does not have the support of the United States. [This signal
**would be an important first step** in changing Saudi behavior because
it would override other statements and actions the United States has
sent that indicate support]{.underline}. And Trump has given Saudi
Arabia a number of positive signals: He called Saudi Arabia a "great
ally" and dismissed reports that that the Saudi government was involved
in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. He has expressed interested
in selling nuclear power plants and technology to Saudi Arabia. And he
has repeatedly claimed that he has made a \$110 billion arms deal with
Saudi Arabia (he hasn't). With these clear signals of support, why
should Saudi Arabia alter its behavior based on resolutions that come
out of the House or Senate, which are likely to be vetoed by Trump,
anyway? An arms embargo would be a clear and unambiguous signal that the
United States disproves of Saudi actions in Yemen. The second reason for
supporting an embargo concerns U.S. allies and the logistical
difficulties of making an embargo have an effect. [One of the reasons
embargoes have little material impact is because they require
cooperation among weapons exporting states]{.underline}. A ban on sales
from one country will have little effect if the target of the embargo
can seek arms elsewhere. Germany, instituted an arms ban against Riyadh
in November 2018, and German leaders have pressured other European
states to stop selling arms to the Saudis. Germany understands the
importance of the embargo as a political signal: as a representative of
the German Green Party explained, "The re-start of arms exports to Saudi
Arabia would be a fatal foreign policy signal and would contribute to
the continued destabilization of the Middle East." But the German
embargo has had minimal effect because Saudi Arabia can get arms
elsewhere. According to the 2019 Military Balance, most of Saudi
Arabia's equipment is American or French in origin, such as the M1A2
Abrams and AMX-30 tanks, Apache and Dauphin helicopters, and F-15C/D
fighter jets. Saudi Arabia has some equipment manufactured wholly or in
part in Germany, such as the Eurofighter Typhoon and the Tornado ground
attack craft, but these weapons are a small portion of its complete
arsenal. A [U.S. embargo would send an **important signal to the
allies** who also supply Saudi Arabia, allowing them to explain
participation in the embargo to their own domestic
constituencies]{.underline}. This is especially important for countries
like France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, that need to export arms
to keep their own production lines running. While the research shows
that sustaining an arms embargo is often the most difficult step,
[embargoes can restrain sending states' arms exports.]{.underline} Even
if a U.S. embargo won't have a direct effect on Saudi Arabia on its own,
[an embargo is important for **building coalitions** for a more
expansive embargo that could affect Saudi behavior.]{.underline} The
Difficulty of Stopping Atrocities [Beyond signaling, we know U.S. arms
sales often end up in the wrong hands, and have been used in
Yemen.]{.underline} The Saudi-led war in Yemen has led to starvation
conditions, caused thousands of civilian casualties, and has led to the
displacement of millions of people. The United Nations estimates that 80
percent of Yemen's population -- 24 million people -- require some form
of humanitarian or protection assistance, and that the severity of the
situation is increasing. Would an arms embargo create meaningful change
in Yemen? [An initial effect of an embargo is that Saudi Arabia would
have to work harder to access war materiel. As Jonathan Caverley noted,
more than **60 percent** of Saudi Arabia's arms delivered in the past
five years came from the United States]{.underline}. Even if this
percentage decreases over time, [it **will be costly** for Saudi Arabia
to transition to a primarily Russian- or Chinese-supplied
military]{.underline}. Though Saudi Arabia might be willing to pay this
cost, it would still have to pay, and take the time to transition to its
new weapons systems. [This would represent]{.underline} a brief [**break
in hostilities** that could **facilitate the delivery of aid** **and
assistance** in Yemen.]{.underline}

So far we have argued that [arms sales lack a compelling strategic
justification, amplify risks, and generate a host of unintended negative
consequences. These factors alone argue for significantly curtailing the
arms trade. But the case for doing so is made even stronger by the fact
that greatly reducing arms sales would also produce two significant
benefits for the United States that cannot otherwise be enjoyed. **The
first benefit**]{.underline} from reducing arms sales would be [greater
diplomatic flexibility and leverage]{.underline}. Critics might argue
that even if arms sales are an imperfect tool, forgoing arms sales will
eliminate a potential source of leverage. We argue that, on the
contrary, [the diplomatic gains from forgoing arms sales will outweigh
the potential leverage or other benefits from arms sales. Most
importantly, by refraining from arming nations engaged in conflict, the
United States will have the diplomatic flexibility to engage with all
parties **as an honest broker**]{.underline}. The inherent difficulty of
negotiating while arming one side is obvious today with respect to North
and South Korea. After decades of U.S. support for South Korea, North
Korea clearly does not trust the United States. Similarly, U.S. attempts
to help negotiate a peace deal between the Israelis and Palestinians
have long been complicated by American support for Israel. [To stop
arming one side of a contentious relationship is not to suggest that the
United States **does not have a preferred outcome** in such cases.
Rather, by staying out of the military domain the United States can more
readily encourage **dialogue and diplomacy.** Forgoing arms sales is
likely to be a superior strategy even in cases where the United States
has an entrenched interest]{.underline}. In the case of Taiwan, for
example, though it is clear that Taiwan needs to purchase weapons from
other countries to provide for its defense, those weapons do not have to
be made in the United States. Having Taiwan buy from other suppliers
would help defuse U.S.-China tensions. Even if Taiwan's defenses
remained robust, China would clearly prefer a situation in which
American arms no longer signal an implicit promise to fight on Taiwan's
behalf. This could also promote more productive U.S.-China diplomacy in
general, as well as greater stability in the Pacific region. Most
important, breaking off arms sales would also reduce the likelihood of
the United States becoming entangled in a future conflict between Taiwan
and China. [The second major benefit of reducing arms sales is that it
would imbue the United States with **greater moral
authority**]{.underline}. [Today, as the leading arms-dealing nation in
the world, the United States lacks credibility in discussions of arms
control and nonproliferation, especially in light of its military
interventionism since 2001]{.underline}. [By showing the world that it
is ready to choose diplomacy over the arms trade, the United States
would provide a huge boost to international efforts to **curtail
proliferation** and its negative consequences]{.underline}. This is
important because the United States has pursued and will continue to
pursue a wide range of arms control and nonproliferation objectives. The
United States is a signatory of treaties dealing with weapons of mass
destruction, missile technology, land mines, and cluster munitions, not
to mention the flow of conventional weapons of all kinds. The
effectiveness of these treaties, and the ability to create more
effective and enduring arms control and nonproliferation frameworks,
however, depends on how the United States behaves. This is not to say
that unilateral American action will put an end to the problems of the
global arms trade. States would still seek to ensure their security and
survival through deterrence and military strength. Other weapons
suppliers would, in the short run, certainly race to meet the demand.
[But history shows that global nonproliferation treaties and weapons
bans typically require great-power support. In 1969, for example,
Richard Nixon decided to shutter the American
offensive-biological-weapons program and seek an international ban on
such weapons]{.underline}. [By 1972 the Biological Weapons Convention
passed and has since been signed by 178 nations.]{.underline}98 In 1991
[President George H. W. Bush unilaterally renounced the use of chemical
weapons. By 1993 the United States had signed the Chemical Weapons
Convention]{.underline}, which now has 192 signatories.99 [Both of these
efforts succeeded in part because the United States took decisive early
action in the absence of any promises about how others would
respond]{.underline}.100 [Without U.S. leadership, any effort to limit
proliferation of major conventional weapons and dangerous emerging
technologies is likely to fail.]{.underline}

On October 2, 2018, Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi entered
the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey and never came out. President
Trump initially refused to publicly condemn the Saudis' assassination of
a dissident on foreign soil. In response, Democrats and Republicans have
slowly started rethinking America's Middle East policy. For example, the
House has voted to withdraw American funding for the Saudi war effort in
Yemen in February, even though GOP leadership continues to block the
bill in the Senate. [Trump]{.underline} joins a long list of U.S.
presidents who have [remained silent on the egregious human rights
abuses perpetrated by one of America's chief allies in the Middle
East.]{.underline} The national security establishment in Washington
has, in effect, adopted the unofficial motto of U.S. Cold War foreign
policy with regards to Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman: "He is a
son of a bitch, but he is our son of a bitch." [However, this
realpolitik doctrine has **proven as brainless** **as it is
heartless**.]{.underline} [America's unconcealed favoritism in the cold
war between Saudi Arabia and Iran has had devastating effects for the
**entire region**]{.underline}. While almost all serious observers agree
that America's war on radical Islamism in the past two decades has been
a complete fiasco, few have dared challenge America's special
relationship with the most radical government in the Middle East.
"Sowing Chaos, Death, and Destruction" [The American national security
establishment has been applying double standards to its relationships
with Iran and Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. Presidents from Reagan to Trump
have denounced Iran as the world's number one sponsor of terrorism.
[However, **almost all of the 61 groups** on the State Department's
terrorist watchlist are **funded by the Saudi government,**]{.underline}
private Saudi donors, or both. While it has fought groups affiliated
with the Muslim Brotherhood like ISIS and Al-Qaeda, [the kingdom
has]{.underline} **[escalated the Syrian civil war]{.underline}** [by
funneling money to extremist organizations like Ahrar Al-Sham and the
Al-Nusra Front.]{.underline} [Contrary to its image as an anchor of
stability, Saudi Arabia, in truth, bears much of the responsibility for
the recent **uptick in violence** and **instability** in the
region.]{.underline} [To reinstate embattled Yemeni president Abdrabbuh
Mansur Hadi against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, bin Salman has
conducted massive airstrikes on Yemeni territory, indiscriminately
targeting schools, hospitals, religious buildings, and civilian
infrastructure]{.underline}. The violence has **[placed 14 million
Yemenis at risk of starvation]{.underline}** [in what the United Nations
warns could become "**the worst famine** in the world **in 100 years."**
Still, the United States has supported the crown prince's bloody war
with both intelligence and weapons, culminating in a \$110 billion arms
deal at the 2017 Riyadh Summit]{.underline}. Only a month after the
meeting that saw [Trump merrily swaying along to a traditional sword
dance, the Saudis, **emboldened by U.S. support**, spearheaded a
blockade of oil-rich Qatar in blatant violation of international
law]{.underline}. The American Threat [According to Trump, however, it
is Iran, and not Saudi Arabia, that is sowing "chaos, death, and
destruction." This assessment ignores the importance of fundamental
security considerations in shaping states' behavior. Iran's foreign
policy is guided by fear of the "American devil]{.underline}." In 1953,
the CIA ended Iran's short flirtation with democracy by deposing the
country's first freely elected prime minister. When George W. Bush,
after including Iran in his infamous "axis of evil," invaded neighboring
Iraq in 2003, Iranian elites worried their country would be next.
Feeling vulnerable, Iran even privately proposed a "grand bargain"
including negotiations on Iran's nuclear program and its support for
Hezbollah and Hamas. "We don't talk to evil," replied Vice President
Cheney on behalf of the Bush administration's emboldened neoconservative
wing. [Fearing **American strategic encirclement**, Iran has since
**doubled down** on its deterrence strategy and pushed ahead with its
nuclear weapons program]{.underline}. [Due to its proximity to
U.S.-allied Israel, Hezbollah plays a central role in this deterrence
strategy, with Syria connecting Iran to its Lebanese proxy
fighters.]{.underline} As Saudi Arabia and the United States began to
throw their support behind the Syrian opposition, Iran fought back to
defend the Assad regime, its most important ally in the region. Two
Shaky Pillars [There is no good reason, idealistic or realistic, for the
divergence in U.S. foreign policy towards Saudi Arabia and
Iran]{.underline}. [The shale revolution has significantly **reduced**
U.S. dependence on oil imports]{.underline}. Within only eight months in
2014, [Saudi oil exports to the United States halved.]{.underline}
Today, [Washington has no reason to continue its commitment to an
alliance **that destroys America's international credibility** as a
supporter of human rights.]{.underline} In an ideal world, the United
States would not have to interact with regimes like Saudi Arabia's or
Iran's. However, in order to defend its interests in the Middle East,
America should engage with both without antagonizing either. From 1969
to 1979, the United States pursued a "two-pillar strategy" in the Middle
East, relying on both Iran and Saudi Arabia to uphold order throughout
the Middle East. Today, America should return to a similar balancing
strategy. [Without an American blank check, the Saudis will likely think
twice before invading and bullying their neighboring countries and
arming radical terrorists.]{.underline} [At the same time, assuaging
Iran's fears about drastic American intervention might allow Iran to
shift away from its continued reliance upon Hezbollah, Assad, and Shia
militias in Iraq]{.underline}. By forcing Iran and Saudi Arabia to the
negotiation table, [Trump could bring an end to conflicts in Yemen and
Syria **and the Qatar blockade.**]{.underline} Such a rebalancing would
no doubt present the most significant change in America's Middle East
policy since 1979. However, given the civil war in Syria, the
humanitarian crisis in Yemen, sectarian infighting in Iraq, the
terrorist activity of ISIS and Al-Qaeda affiliates, and persistent
anti-Americanism throughout the region, it is high time for a change. A
new, more balanced foreign policy would be both more fair and more
effective in pursuing American interests in the region.

### 2AC Arms Sales Leverage = Reform 

#### Arms sales are a bargaining chip to force Saudi reforms on human rights 

**Guay 18** \[Terrence Guay, Clinical Professor of International
Business, Pennsylvania State University; "Arms sales to Saudi Arabia
give Trump all the leverage he needs in Khashoggi affair" The
Conversation, 10-19-18;

GMDI

Among Donald Trump's many unusual characteristics as president is his
frankness. Last week, after the disappearance and apparent torture and
murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, Trump argued that
"we would be punishing ourselves" by canceling arms sales to Saudi
Arabia over a human rights concern. Few world leaders, or former U.S.
presidents, would have been so bold as to publicly admit that a Saudi
journalist's life is not worth the loss of arms sales. And it's true
that the armaments relationship between these two countries is
long-established and lucrative for U.S. companies, as my own research on
the global defense industry shows. [However, the president has it wrong
when he argues the U.S. would be "foolish" to use these sales as
leverage with the Saudis, claiming they could just get their tanks and
fighter jets from other countries. In fact it's **one of the best
bargaining chips** he has with the kingdom.]{.underline} An arms-buying
behemoth Saudi Arabia is indeed a major weapons buyer. [Saudi Arabia
spent US\$69.4 billion on military expenditures in 2017, according to
the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute,]{.underline} the
world's leading research organization on conflict, armaments, arms
control and disarmament. Only the U.S. and China spent more. [But since
it doesn't have an arms industry -- like the U.S. and China -- Saudi
Arabia must import most of that from other countries. That's why, over
the past decade, Saudi Arabia **has imported more armaments** than every
country but India.]{.underline} And U.S. companies such as Boeing,
Lockheed Martin and Raytheon have benefited most from all that spending,
making up the 55 percent of its weapons imports from 2008 to 2017. That
has made Saudi Arabia the top buyer of American arms, with 11.8 percent
of all sales over that period. In fact, U.S. defense contractors have
made almost \$90 billion selling arms to Saudi Arabia since 1950. [In
recent years, fighter planes like the F-15 and their spare parts have
become particularly important to the weapons trade with Saudi Arabia
because it needs them to conduct its bombing campaigns in
Yemen.]{.underline} For example, a 2011 contract awarded \$30 billion to
U.S. defense contractors to produce 84 F-15 jets and other weaponry for
the Saudi military. Boeing stands to earn \$24 billion of this total,
which the company claimed will support over 50,000 U.S. jobs. A bargain
over human rights As president, Trump clearly hopes that the money
continues to pour in and helps him with his "America First" campaign,
intended to create jobs for Americans. It's no surprise, then, that he
made his first foreign trip as president to Saudi Arabia in May 2017.
During the trip, he reportedly struck a bargain with Saudi Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman: [Trump wouldn't lecture his kingdom on human
rights, and Saudi Arabia would buy more American weapons.]{.underline}
Unfortunately, Trump's claim to have secured \$110 billion in arms sales
has not materialized. Although the Saudis signed numerous letters of
intent and interest, some of which had been approved by the Obama
administration, no new contracts have resulted, due mainly to lower oil
prices and the Saudis' costly war in Yemen. [So in the Khashoggi affair,
it appears that Trump is eager to keep to his end of the bargain. He has
avoided criticizing the Saudi government over its alleged role in
Khashoggi's disappearance to curry favor with the monarchy over arms
sales. Even in the face of Turkish reports that Saudi agents tortured
Khashoggi and dismembered his body and U.S. intelligence supporting
those allegations, Trump has preferred to blame "rogue killers" for any
crime.]{.underline} In defending this course of action[, Trump claimed
that "if they don't buy \[weapons\] from us, they're going to buy it
from Russia or they're going to buy it from China]{.underline} or
they're going to buy it from other countries." US leverage While it's
true that Russia and China are indeed major exporters of armaments[, the
claim that U.S. weapons **can easily be replaced** by other suppliers
**is not**]{.underline} -- at least not in the short term. First, [once
a country is "locked in" to a specific kind of weapons system, such as
planes, tanks or naval vessels, **the cost** to switch to a different
supplier **can be huge**. Military personnel **must be retrained** on
new equipment, spare parts need to be replaced, and operational
changes]{.underline} may be necessary. [After being so reliant on U.S.
weapons systems for decades, the transition costs]{.underline} to buy
from another country could [**be prohibitive** even for oil-rich Saudi
Arabia. The second problem]{.underline} with Trump's argument [is that
armaments from Russia, China]{.underline} or elsewhere are simply [not
as sophisticated as U.S. weapons,]{.underline} which is why they are
usually cheaper -- though the quality gap is quickly decreasing. [To
maintain **its military superiority** in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia
has opted to purchase **virtually all** of its weapons from
American]{.underline} and European companies. [That is why **the U.S.
has significant leverage** in this aspect of the relationship. Any
**Saudi threat to retaliate** against a ban on U.S. arms sales by buying
weapons from countries that have not raised concerns about the Khashoggi
disappearance **would not be credible**.]{.underline} And is probably
why, despite worries in the White House, such a threat has not yet been
made[.]{.underline} In many ways, Saudi Arabia is locked in to buying
U.S. weapons such as missiles for F-15 fighters. AP Photo/Scott
Applewhite Selling ideals for short-term gains [Since the end of World
War II, the U.S. has developed a **global reputation** as a **moral
authority** championing human rights. Yes, there have been many times
when realpolitik took priority. But despite these moments, the U.S.
managed also to maintain its authority by advocating respect for human
rights as a global norm during the Cold War, and within many repressive
regimes ever since. With Khashoggi, Trump is choosing to give up that
mantle completely by showing his priority is **purely economic**,
regardless of the impact on the United States' global reputation. Such a
bald-faced strategy, in my view,]{.underline} [**sells American values
short** and **weakens U.S. global credibility**.]{.underline}

[The latest Saudi explanation of what happened to journalist Jamal
Khashoggi --- that his murder was premeditated by his assailants --- is
no more acceptable an explanation]{.underline} than the earlier
versions, [that he died accidentally]{.underline} in a fistfight or that
he left the Saudi consulate in Istanbul without leaving a trace. It
defies belief that this operation wasn't ordered at the highest level.
But that's not the point. The Saudis were never going to conduct the
"complete, thorough and timely investigation," as Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo called for after meeting with Saudi leaders this month. Even
President Donald Trump has now acknowledged as much, saying that "the
cover-up was the worst in the history of cover-ups." It marks a notable
change in tone by the president who initially seemed more concerned with
preserving his good personal relations with the Saudis than with getting
to the bottom of what happened. But while the president's tone may have
changed, his policies toward Saudi Arabia have not. "In terms of what we
ultimately do ...," President Trump said recently, "I'm going to leave
it up to Congress." Of course, Congress is not scheduled to return to
session until the middle of next month, making the president's plan more
of an intentional delay on the bet that the outrage will blow over and
less of an appeal for a firm bipartisan response. The delay is just the
latest such bet by Trump. From the outset of his administration, the
president has doubled down on the Saudi king and his young son, Prince
Mohammed bin Salman. After all, they represented the pillar of his
Middle East strategy. [Trump made Riyadh his first stop on his first
overseas trip and assured the Saudis he would not lecture them on their
human rights record and embraced their efforts to counter
Iran.]{.underline} [He **stood by** Prince Mohammed despite a string of
reckless Saudi moves, including **blockading** Qatar, **kidnapping** the
Lebanese prime minister, **imprisoning** hundreds of Saudi royals and
businesspeople **without due process**, and cutting off relations with
Canada over a critical tweet.]{.underline} This [terrible saga is but
the **latest proof** of **Trump's abdication** of America's traditional
global leadership]{.underline}. From day one, he has made a habit of
cozying up to dictators and strongmen, accepting their denials,
explanations and promises even when the U.S. intelligence community said
all the evidence pointed the other way. Think Vladimir Putin's denial of
Russian interference in the 2016 elections. Or Rodrigo Duterte's
insistence that the extrajudicial killing of thousands of Filipinos was
necessary to win the drug war. Or Kim Jong Un's promise to denuclearize.
And now Prince Mohammed's claim that Khashoggi's death was an ordinary
detention gone just a bit wrong. [It wasn't all that long ago that an
American president, faced with such a horrendous abuse of power and
gross violation of human rights, especially by a close partner, would
have made clear his outrage and acted accordingly. Indeed, America's
traditional **global leadership** role --- as leader of the free world
--- would have dictated a very different response than we have seen so
far.]{.underline} What might such leadership entail? • First, Washington
could turn to the United Nations Security Council and demand an
international investigation, including the full cooperation of the
Turkish and Saudi governments, to find out what happened to Khashoggi.
Given the denials and obfuscations from Riyadh, no Saudi investigation
can be considered conclusive. • Second, until such an investigation has
been completed and those guilty are brought to justice, the United
States should suspend all arms sales to Saudi Arabia, and convince its
allies to do the same. The kingdom depends almost entirely upon U.S.,
British and French arms supplies, including for maintenance and
training. That provides real leverage. [The Saudis have too much
invested in U.S. and Western weapons to quickly switch to Russian or
Chinese substitutes.]{.underline} • Third, [the time has come to
pressure Riyadh to end its indiscriminate bombing and brutal war in
Yemen.]{.underline} Prince Mohammed started this ill-fated military
mission two years ago, ostensibly to prevent Iranian inroads onto the
Arabian Peninsula. But the conflict has done little to blunt Iran while
killing tens of thousands of Yemenis, wounding hundreds of thousands of
others and leaving millions destitute, facing wide-scale famine and
disease with no help in sight. [Without U.S. intelligence and weapons
supplies, the Saudi]{.underline} and United Arab Emirates [bombing
effort would quickly end.]{.underline} [Real leadership would begin with
Washington reminding Riyadh that the U.S.-Saudi relationship isn't one
of equals]{.underline}. The White House **[holds most of the
cards]{.underline}**, [and it is high time to use them]{.underline}.
[Doing anything less will embolden Prince Mohammed to continue his
reckless behavior --- and risk triggering an **even greater crisis** ---
while deeply damaging America's credibility as a **defender of human
rights.**]{.underline}

### 2AC A2: Current Legislation Solves

#### Loopholes allow human rights abuses to continue -- Trump is planning to increase sales

[Arms control experts have voiced concerns over possible loopholes in
President Trump\'s new arms export policy, which they argue may make it
**easier for US companies** to sell weapon to governments that violate
human rights, The Intercept reported.]{.underline} In April the Trump
Administration issued its new Conventional Arms Transfer policy. The
[new rules were criticised by human rights groups and arms control
advocates, including Amnesty International and the Arms Control
Association, for prioritising a relaxed arms sales regime over
transparency and human rights.]{.underline} The White House said it
would \"advocate strongly on behalf of United States companies.\" The
Intercept reported. The policy change could ease the path of arms
transfers from the United States to, in particular, its two largest
weapons customers, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Both are
pursuing an ongoing bombing campaign in Yemen which has so far killed
over 5,000 civilians. [The loophole could be created by a one-word
change from Obama\'s Conventional Arms Transfer Policy, issued in 2014.
The old policy prohibited arms transfers to countries that commit
\"attacks directed against civilian objects or civilians,\" whereas the
Trump administration\'s new policy bars transfers that are
\"**intentionally\" directed** against civilian objects or
civilians.]{.underline} A two-month consultation period followed the
release of the new policy in April, which ended last month. On Monday
the State-department published a statement that said [the policy **would
energise** a \"whole-of-government effort to **expedite transfers** that
support \[the administration\'s\] essential foreign policy and national
security objectives.\"]{.underline} Colby Goodman, an arms sales
researcher and director of the Security Assistance Monitor at the Center
for International Policy told The Intercept that arms groups had
objected to the word \"intentional,\" but no changes had been made.
\"Depending on how this policy is implemented, this focus could make it
harder for those in the U.S. government \[with\] legitimate human rights
concerns to block or modify some proposed U.S. arms sales,\" he said.
[The current administration\'s new wording could help the US sell arms
to countries that repeatedly kill civilians, by relying on the argument
that the civilian casualties are unintentional.]{.underline} One Trump
aide, speaking in April on the condition of anonymity, told Reuters that
the Trump adminstration has been aiming to reduce human rights
restrictions which have led to a \"veto\" over some arms deals. Despite
concerns from Amnesty International and other groups over the new
policy, the Obama administration also supported arms sales to the
Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, selling \$20 billion worth of weapons in
the face of opposition from human rights groups and under the pretext
that civilian casualties in Yemen were unintentional. [\"Those hoping
this administration might learn lessons from the past about how U.S.
weapons ended up being misused, or show proper restraint in sales to
countries such as Saudi Arabi]{.underline}a and the UAE, [have nothing
to cheer in the new policy or its implementation plan to
date]{.underline},\" Jeff Abramson, a senior fellow at the Arms Control
Association told The Intercept.

### Yemen Human Rights Violations

#### Saudi abuses in Yemen deck the laws of war

The [Saudi-led coalition]{.underline} and the Houthi armed group
[engaged in a conflict in Yemen]{.underline} which [have turned the
country\'s humanitarian crisis into a full-blown
catastrophe]{.underline}, [Human Rights Watch said]{.underline} today in
its World Report 2019. Since the armed conflict escalated in March 2015,
the [warring **parties** have **committed numerous laws-of-war
violations**]{.underline}, [**worsened** the country\'s **humanitarian
situation**]{.underline}**,** [and failed to hold those responsible for
**war crimes to account**]{.underline}. The United States, United
Kingdom, France, and other weapons suppliers have risked complicity in
abuses through arms sales to Saudi Arabia and other coalition
governments. The [United Nations]{.underline} has [warned that **without
a** dramatic **change** in the situation, **nearly half of Yemen\'s
population will be at risk of starvation**]{.underline}. The [Saudi-led
coalition]{.underline} and Houthi forces [have indiscriminately
attacked]{.underline}, forcibly disappeared, [and blocked food and
medicine to Yemeni civilians]{.underline}, said Sarah Leah Whitson,
Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. Governments
around the globe can either do nothing while millions sink closer toward
famine or use the leverage at their disposal to press the warring
parties to end their abuses and impose sanctions on those obstructing
aid. In the 674-page World Report 2019, its 29th edition, Human Rights
Watch reviewed human rights practices in more than 100 countries. In his
introductory essay, Executive Director Kenneth Roth says that the
populists spreading hatred and intolerance in many countries are
spawning a resistance. New alliances of rights-respecting governments,
often prompted and joined by civic groups and the public, are raising
the cost of autocratic excess. Their successes illustrate the
possibility of defending human rights - indeed, the responsibility to do
so - even in darker times. [Yemen\'s armed conflict has taken a terrible
toll]{.underline} [on the population]{.underline}. [Fighting has killed
and wounded thousands of civilians]{.underline}. Millions suffer from
shortages of food and medical care, yet the warring parties continue
impeding aid. Across the country, civilians suffer from a lack of basic
services, a spiraling economic crisis, and broken governance, health,
education, and judicial systems. [The coalition has conducted scores of
indiscriminate and disproportionate airstrikes killing thousands of
civilians and hitting critical infrastructure and other civilian
structures in violation of the laws of war]{.underline}. Houthi forces
have recruited children, used landmines and fired artillery and rockets
indiscriminately into cities such as Taizz and Aden, and into Saudi
Arabia. Houthi forces, government-affiliated forces, and the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) and UAE-backed Yemeni forces have arbitrarily detained or
forcibly disappeared scores of people. Houthi forces have held people as
hostages. Yemeni officials in Aden have beaten, raped, and tortured
detained migrants and asylum seekers from the Horn of Africa, including
women and children. [The coalition has failed to conduct credible
investigations into abuses, and coalition member countries have sought
to avoid international legal liability]{.underline} by refusing to
provide information on their forces\' role in unlawful attacks. The
Houthi armed group also has not punished its commanders responsible for
war crimes. Senior officials implicated in abuses remain in positions of
authority across the country. One cost of Yemen\'s war has been the
closing space for civil society groups. Warring parties have arrested,
harassed, threatened, and forcibly disappeared Yemeni activists,
journalists, lawyers, and rights defenders. Women activists, who have
played a prominent role documenting abuses and advocating for their end,
have been threatened, subjected to smear campaigns, beaten, and
detained. Humanitarian aid workers have also been killed, wounded and
detained. Rather than risk complicity in the next airstrike on a wedding
or on a bus filled with children, [the US, UK, and France should tell
Saudi Arabia that weapons sales won\'t continue until war crimes stop
and those responsible are prosecuted]{.underline}, Whitson said.

Second, [the U.S. retains a disproportionate level of influence ---
economically and militarily --- that compels other countries to deal
with us.]{.underline} But over time, Trump's leadership will steadily
erode U.S. credibility. The longer Trump stays in power, the higher the
likelihood that U.S. leadership and authority will dramatically
diminish. [Why does credibility matter? A country with a high amount of
credibility is able to build important alliances because potential
allies are not worried about betrayal or potential
abandonment.]{.underline} [Credibility allows a country **to deter
adversaries** **and prevent costly wars** through **strength of
reputation** rather than through **fighting.**]{.underline}
[Conventional wisdom says that a country is only as trustworthy as its
last words or actions]{.underline}, and that credibility can dissipate
swiftly (Will Rogers' quip comes to mind: "It takes a lifetime to build
a good reputation, but you can lose it in a minute"). But that
conventional view of credibility is not accurate. A country's reputation
does not ebb and flow based on the week-to-week actions of its leader.
While current leadership is a critical aspect of credibility, it is just
one of many ingredients that countries use to evaluate reputation. In
other words, a number of factors come into play when it comes to shaping
a country's reputation. For example, what actions has the country
undertaken in the past? What present interests does the country have?
What capabilities and resolve does the country possess in order to
defend those interests? [The good news is that **most of these elements
remain positive** for the U.S. Despite the recent rashness of the Trump
administration, the U.S. **enjoys a solid reputation** for steadfastness
and resolve going back decades.]{.underline} It [retains enormous
capabilities to defend its interests]{.underline}. As ongoing wars
against the Islamic State and the Taliban demonstrate, the U.S. also
maintains sufficient resolve to deploy and wield force when necessary.
**[At the same time]{.underline}**, [past actions and capabilities are
**not permanent conditions**]{.underline}. [The longer Trump lurches the
U.S. along an unpredictable path, the more the world will begin to
forget the United States\' extended history as a guarantor of the
international system]{.underline}.

Substantially more people experience liberty today than at the end of
World War II, but more than half the world's population still lives in
countries where basic political rights and civil liberties are only
partly respected, if at all. The last decade in particular has not been
good for freedom. For ten consecutive years, Freedom House has
documented a worrisome "decline in global freedom." The National
Endowment for Democracy has warned of authoritarian regimes cracking
down at home while also "seeking to reshape the international order and
democratic norms." [From China to Russia to the Middle East, the
challengers to liberalism are gaining ground. It is in the direct and
immediate interest of the United States to **help shift the balance** by
**supporting the advance of human rights** and freedom
abroad.]{.underline} IT IS IN THE DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE INTEREST OF THE
UNITED STATES TO SUPPORT THE ADVANCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOM ABROAD.
THE CURRENT MOOD IN THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT APPEAR CONDUCIVE TO THIS
STRATEGY. The current mood in the United States does not appear
conducive to this strategy. New Pew Research polling shows that 69
percent of Americans believe the United States should "concentrate more
on our own national problems." Seventy percent want the next U.S.
president to focus on domestic policy over foreign policy. [Yet in order
to address the "major threats" that keep Americans awake at night ---
ISIS, foreign cyberattacks, global economic instability, the spread of
infectious diseases, the refugee crisis --- **strong U.S. leadership is
required**, as are strategies that help advance rule of law, good
governance, open markets, and other features of free
societies.]{.underline} So where do we go from here? One step would be
for policymakers, presidential candidates, and other public office
hopefuls to make the promotion of democracy and human rights an
important part of their foreign policy agendas. This March, 139 policy
experts, civil society leaders, and former elected
officials---Republicans and Democrats alike---signed a letter
encouraging the presidential candidates to do just that. While
recognizing that "democracy and human rights cannot be the only items on
the foreign policy agenda," the letter calls [it a "false choice" to pit
the pursuit of democratic ideals against national security.]{.underline}
I was proud to sign that letter. A second step would be to engage the
American people in a conversation about the impact of advancing freedom
on our own peace, prosperity, and security. [At the end of World War II,
for example, many questioned whether democracy was compatible with
Germany and Japan. The United States actively supported the development
of democratic institutions and practices. Today, Germany and Japan are
among our strongest partners and allies in the world, and Americans reap
tangible benefits.]{.underline} In North Texas, where the Bush Institute
is located, the relocation of Toyota's North American headquarters is
expected to create jobs and have an economic impact of \$7 billion in
the first ten years, according to estimates when the move was announced.
[During the Cold War, the United States supported democratic reform in
places like Taiwan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Chile. The end of
the Cold War was a major victory for freedom in Central and Eastern
Europe. After decades of Soviet nuclear threat, it also was a great
victory for American peace and security. Today, the moral and strategic
imperatives of advancing human rights are just as
compelling]{.underline}. In Afghanistan, [investing in women promotes
stability and helps reduce the possibility of future terrorist attacks
on the United States]{.underline} emanating from that country. In the
Middle East, [the spread of]{.underline} Islamic extremism and [ISIS has
had devastating consequences, and the United States is not immune. In
North Korea, a regime that systematically and horrifically abuses the
rights of its own people seeks nuclear weapons that can reach our
shores.]{.underline}

**[S]{.underline}**ea [militarized "islands," Crimea, Ukraine,
Syria]{.underline}---[undergird his argument. This **does not mean** we
are now back in that period of extreme danger]{.underline}, 1940--90,
[when all foreign policy decisions had to be taken in the context of a
Manichean struggle]{.underline}. [Neither China nor Russia has any
intention of]{.underline} waging war against the United States or
[**fully replacing** the global order. But they certainly
are]{.underline}, as Mead says, [**trying to overturn that order in
areas of interest to them**. The best analogy is the 1930s, when there
was a **risk** that world order could collapse, but **no**]{.underline}
such **[inevitability]{.underline}**.

Under such circumstances, [robust reactions to challenges to the system
are]{.underline} not \"choices,\" so much as [**obligations to protect
system integrity**, as challengers **gain strength---and further
temptation---by victories** against the system\'s values]{.underline},
**[especially]{.underline}** rule of law and **[collective
security]{.underline}**. Even in a world under challenge, you can't
defend everywhere (see Tibet), and applying global priorities to
individual problems can fail (Vietnam). But you also cannot react to
assaults on places like Crimea or Aleppo, or the Sudetenland, Manchuria
and Abyssinia, solely on the basis of their "intrinsic value." [In a
collective security system, security **has to be nearly indivisible**,
applying **most everywhere**]{.underline}, and the values that justify
action universal. In such a world, the attitudes Pillar ascribes to
Obama, from no permanent friends to avoiding general labels when dealing
with individual problems to letting others solve them, can be deadly.
[You defend a collective security system with the]{.underline}
**[allies]{.underline}** and friends [**you have, not the ones you
want**; if you are the strongest, you lead, because **anything less
risks failure**; you **value "credibility**]{.underline}," a concept
Obama repeatedly dismissed, [because it is crucial to allies' trust and
**system predictability**]{.underline}.

That is arguably where we need to be today, even acknowledged by Obama
in his September 2015 UN address: "The United States... \[built\] an
international system that imposes a cost on those who choose conflict...
\[but\] dangerous currents risk pulling back into a darker, more
disordered world." But with Goldberg, and with his actions, Obama seems
to have forgotten his wise words. By throwing up his hands because
Russia cares more about the Ukraine, or wanting Saudi Arabia to "share"
the Middle East with Iran, he is not reconciling ancient animosities
with no objective right or wrong; he is [**yielding to those "dangerous
currents**" that **oppose the global status quo**]{.underline}. That [is
the path to **catastrophe**]{.underline}.

Dilemma: US Policy and Practice, 2016, pp. 155-164

[The world is fraught with dangers]{.underline}. [While the specific
risks have changed, history illustrates]{.underline} well
[that]{.underline} [risks]{.underline} [have and will]{.underline}
likely [always abound]{.underline}. [There are numerous
conflicts]{.underline} going on [around the world that pose]{.underline}
[risks for energy supplies and prices]{.underline}. [In the Middle East.
Iran and the United States have signed an]{.underline} [agreement on
Iran's nuclear program]{.underline}: [ISIS controls parts of Iraq and
Syria]{.underline} and is making advances; a coalition in the Middle
East being led by [Saudi]{.underline} Arabia [launched airstrikes in
Yemen]{.underline} in 2014 and is seeking to oust the Iranian-backed
Houthis. who control the countrys capital. [In Europe]{.underline}
[Russia continues]{.underline} [to be at the center of crisis in Eastern
Europe]{.underline} through the support of separatist groups in Ukraine,
[while]{.underline} [holding the threat of disrupting natural
gas]{.underline} supplies. [And in Asia]{.underline}, [China has begun
constructing an airfield]{.underline} and other infrastructure [in the
disputed Spratly]{.underline} and Paraoel [Island chains]{.underline} in
order to bolster its claims of ownership to the uninhabited territories.
The attempt in this chapter is not to thoroughly examine each of these
risks and crises with respect to energy, to solve global energy
problems, or to employ a historical analysis to lay blame, explain
current crises and provide definitive lessons learned. If we did learn
from history, then energy consumers around the world would be likely to
dramatically and permanently reduce dependence on far-flung energy and
natural resource markets for fuels that cause lasting environmental
harm. [The key energy resource]{.underline}---oil ---[that the world
pursues vigorously is **finite in supply**]{.underline} (though new
discoveries and technology advances continue to allow global supplies to
meet global demand) and faces growing demands as developing countries
become richer. [This]{.underline}, n itself, [creates enormous energy
security risks]{.underline} to those who maintain long-term reliance on
petroleum, [International sources of supply will eventually disappear or
become]{.underline} [nearly unmarketable due to the cost of resource
extraction and]{.underline} its [transportation]{.underline} to distant
markets. Consider this: if the United States could start with a clean
slate today and have an opportunity to choose from a variety of energy
sources, it seems highly unlikely that there would be great support for
massive reliance upon an energy source that has to be shipped to the
domestic market from around the world, that is subject to periodic
disruptions resulting from political conflict in the Middle East. that
is characterized by great volatility in prices, that requires large
investments of money. energy and water to produce for consumption, that
pollutes the air and changes the global climate when used as intended.
that periodically spills and causes large and small bodies of water to
become polluted, and that will eventually run out, or more accurately,
will become too expensive to access once the most accessible reserves
have become depleted. Rather than considering these 'What-ifs' this book
examines the energy wants and needs of the United States and highlights
the dilemmas and risks inherent in attempting to meet a plethora of
multifaceted energy security goals. To that end, the focus in this
chapter is on key global issues within the context of US policy concerns
and actions, Emphasizing again the central argument of this book---that
the effort to achieve greater energy security contains its own
contradictions and obstacles---we consider a frameworic for
understanding US energy security objectives and energy policy with
regard to the rest of the world, and how a number of global institutions
and actors impact the energy security of the United States. [While US
energy policy in the domestic realm]{.underline} [has come to be about
moving toward alternative]{.underline}. cleaner renewable
[energy]{.underline} resources, expanding domestic supplies of oil and
natural gas, reducing energy demands, and increasing efficiency. [the
global dimensions]{.underline} of US energy policy [are]{.underline}
generally [about trying to]{.underline} find a better way to [ensure
stable, reliable, global markets and supply chains]{.underline} for oil
and natural gas, while [diminishing the potential for
**energy-related**]{.underline} political and **[military
conflict]{.underline}**, [or at]{.underline} [least]{.underline},
[insulating]{.underline} [the country]{.underline} as much as possible
[from the]{.underline} adverse [impacts]{.underline} of such conflict.
Of course, [these]{.underline} [goals are]{.underline} also
[tied]{.underline} in part [to]{.underline} the question of **[how much
oil and gas can be produced domestically]{.underline}**. A Framework for
the US View of Energy Security On August 1. 2007, sailors from two
[Russian mini-submarines planted a]{.underline} titanium Russian [flag
on the]{.underline} [seabed of the Arctic Ocean]{.underline}, 14.000
feet [under the]{.underline} ice at the [North Pole]{.underline}. As a
technological feat it was a potentially dangerous mission and a
record-breaking dive, even if in practical terms it meant little for
anything the Russians are currently doing in the Arctic. [As a political
matter, it was significant]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} potentially
[troublesome]{.underline}, [as the Russians were making a political
claim]{.underline}, whereby [planting their flag was connected
to]{.underline} the [assertion of a right to exploit natural resources
in the area. Establishing a sovereign right to natural resources in a
maritime setting]{.underline} is nothing new or surprising. Countries do
this ail the tiriie in their territorial waters, and in areas where they
are granted economic tights under international law. [In areas not
globally recognized as part of a particular country's
territory]{.underline}, this type of action [can be
troubling]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} it [is
increasing]{.underline}. Countries such as che United States and Catiada
were quick to dismiss the Russian move as a stunt. As the Canadian
Foreittn Minister said, "This isn't the 15th centur. You can't go around
the world and just pLirit flags and say ''e're claiming this
tei-riwry'."1 But [Russia has made the claim that]{.underline} a portion
of [the Arctic seabed is Russian Maritime territory, and that the vast
energy resources there are]{.underline} tints [Russia's]{.underline}.
[If this]{.underline} type of political conflict over energy resources
[is a sign of things to come, it]{.underline} [represents a **worrisome
development**]{.underline}. [One of the great benefits che United
States]{.underline} and its allies [achieved in the wake of World War Il
was]{.underline} the restoration and strengthening of [an **open global
trading regime**---a set of rules that made it possible for countries to
acquire the resources they wanted by **trading, rather than being
tempted to**]{.underline} seize or [**conquer** lands with resources
they coveted]{.underline}. One of the lessons of the war, in which
[Japan and Germany pursued]{.underline} (among other things) **[economic
strength and self---sufficiency through war]{.underline}** and conquest.
was most [certainly]{.underline} that [there is great value in building
and maintaining a liberal trading order]{.underline}. This type of
approach to the acquisition of goods lias been a consistent feature of
[US foreign policy]{.underline}. which [has long seen US security as
being tied to a mar]{.underline}itime-[based, global trading
system]{.underline}. In the 1 940s, with the adoption of the Gen eral
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), [the US took its preferred way
of]{.underline} [doing business global,]{.underline} leading a global
effort to move countries away from the imperial policies and practices
that led to European colonial control over most of che world. [In the
era of the]{.underline} GATE, and its successor, the World Trade Organi
zation ([WTO]{.underline}), [this liberal economic order has been
**remarkably successful** in helping to **prevent violent conflict over
natural resources**]{.underline}, at least **[among the world's big
powers]{.underline}**. [During this period trading rules and
institutions, along with US]{.underline} [power and leadership, helped
to **break**]{.underline}, or at least greatly diminish. **[the
links]{.underline}** [between]{.underline} [nationalism, violence and
resource sufficiency]{.underline}. In the postwar period, [in
order]{.underline} for the US, or Japan. or Europe [to get]{.underline}
"their" [oil, they have not needed or wanted]{.underline} [to
conquer]{.underline} or colonize [lands]{.underline} [that held the
oil]{.underline}. [Getting to this point has been a key goal of US
global energy policy. encompassing]{.underline} an overarching framework
for the US energy security worldview, namely [the]{.underline}
de-politicization and the **[demilitarization of energy
markets]{.underline}**, which particularly impacts oil and natural gas.
'\[[lie US certainly has a long record of dealings in order to
install]{.underline} or support friendly [goveninwnts. whose energy
policies have conformed to American goals]{.underline} and interests.
The ousting of the government of Iran in 1953 is [a notable
example]{.underline} of this. More recently, [the US-led war
in]{.underline} 1991 to remove Saddam Hussein's [Iraq]{.underline} from
Kuwait, and push back Iraq lest it become too dominant in che region and
control such a large share of the world's petroleum reserves, was indeed
a massive 111(1 violent undert.ikmg. These actions certainly helped to
sustain US power, as well as control over how the global oil market
would operate. [Nonetheless]{.underline}, [these examples are a far
cry]{.underline} from Japan's Greater hast---Asia Co---Prosperity Sphere
of the 1930s and [1940s, in which Japan sought to conquer]{.underline}
and control most of East [Asia]{.underline} and the Western Pacific [to
ensure its economic security and self--- sufficiency]{.underline}. '[The
US has not sought outright control of Iranian or Iraqi land
and]{.underline} [oil]{.underline} resources---for itself or for US oil
companies---in a way that Japan did in East Asia. [The levels of
violence, insecurity, destruction and disorder between the
two]{.underline} [eras are **incomparable**]{.underline}. [One may argue
that the pre---World War II period was a]{.underline} [different world,
but **that is exactly the point**]{.underline}. It was. [Now, the US and
others can largely rely on markets to meet their energy
needs]{.underline}, and even if the US penodi--- cally favors one
government over another in a particular country, such t'avoricisni is.
according to a US---centered viewpoint, aimed at ensuring countries
operate within the trading mies and international norms that govern a
more liberal trad--- ing and economic order. US policy by this
fomulation has not been designed to ensure exclusive
[American]{.underline} access to [oil resources]{.underline}, or even to
assure that contracts go to American companies. Instead, its broad
objectives have largely been aimed toward [assur]{.underline}ing [that a
global energy market can **continue to function**]{.underline}. In other
words, it uses policy and state power to allow a market to allocate oil
resources, rather than using policy and power to supplant a global oil
market. According to chis understanding, the United States characterizes
its policy as one aimed not only at promoting its own interests. hut a
larger, general interest that benefits others (though it is often the
conceit ot the powerful to assUme that other countncs do in fact, or at
least should, share their interests). [With respect to energy. this
system may be starting to **show signs of breaking**]{.underline}
**[down]{.underline}**. [The demand for oil and natural gas]{.underline}
around the world [is **growing**, and is]{.underline} [expected
to]{.underline} do so [for a long time]{.underline}. [The]{.underline}
US **[E]{.underline}**nergy **[I]{.underline}**nformation
**[A]{.underline}**dministration [projects that global oil demand will
rise from 87]{.underline} million hhl/day [to 119 million]{.underline}
[bbl/day by 2040]{.underline}. With respect to [natural gas, demand is
expected to rise from]{.underline} [118 to 185 trillion cubic feet in
the same timeframe]{.underline}. [In the efforts states are]{.underline}
[making to ensure that they will have sufficient and
reliable]{.underline} energy supplies---and this means largely [oil and
natural gas---to fuel their economies]{.underline}, it appears that
[nationalism is becoming **increasingly tied to**]{.underline} the
problem of **[resource sufficiency]{.underline}**. [Countries, including
the United States, want "their]{.underline}" [oil and]{.underline}
natural [gas, and]{.underline} are [increasingly **see**]{.underline}ing
energy **[acquisition as]{.underline}** a **[zero-sum]{.underline}**
game. [This is what drove the Russian expedition to the North
Pole]{.underline}, a development that Michael Klare calls "the race for
what's left," and Britain's Daily Tehraph characterized as [the
beginning]{.underline} [of "the worlds **last colonial
scramble**]{.underline}."4 [It is what drives]{.underline}
[America']{.underline}s goal of [seeking]{.underline} to deny regional
[power]{.underline} and influence [in the]{.underline} Persian
[Gulf]{.underline} to other major powers, while trying to bolster its
own. [It is what drives China's vast undertakings in]{.underline}
[Africa and]{.underline} Central [Asia]{.underline} to secure energy
resources through state-to-state contracts and direct pipelines.
Unfortunately, [this trend seems **likely to increase**]{.underline}.
Oil-Fueled Conflict If the United States, China and others seek to
acquire and use the massive quuititles of thc same fossil flicis the
world has used tor the last 100 years, and to consume energy at the
level they expect and want, while at the same time adding to the mix the
[nationalistic fears and assertions]{.underline} that [are likely to
**increase** as a result of **energy insecurity**]{.underline}, it means
that the diverse and sometimes competing energy secunty objectives we
have identified---iiieeting energy needs, procunng energy
ecoiioniically, protecting national security, and protecting the
environment---will clash with one another. To simply seek out more oil
and natural gas to meet growing needs means that the threats both
domestically arid abroad will he likely to multiply. [US foreign
policyniakers identil' a number of potential threats to
global]{.underline} and US national [security]{.underline} resulting
[from]{.underline} the [worldwide dependence]{.underline} and increased
use [of oil.]{.underline} [First]{.underline} of all, there is the
problem of **[nuclear proliferation]{.underline}**. The number one
example of this from the US perspective has been [Iran]{.underline},
which [benefits greatly]{.underline} [from high oil prices and has been
able to allocate resources to]{.underline}ward [its nuclear]{.underline}
[program]{.underline}. Though the government of Iran has protested that
its nuclear prograni is not meant for the development of weapons, such
claims have been unconvin--- cirig to many other countries, particularly
the United States. [This has led]{.underline} to the framework agreement
arrived at in 2015 by American and Iranian negotiators; it has led the
US and [Israel to consider]{.underline} the possibility of [a **military
strike**]{.underline} [to prevent]{.underline} Iran from developing [a
nuclear weapon in the absence of agreement]{.underline} or úilure of
implementation; [and it leads to concerns about a **regional arms
race**]{.underline}, as neigh boring states may consider building their
own nuclear weapons [in response to any]{.underline} [Iranian
g]{.underline}ains. What's more. [Iran has enjoyed]{.underline} a level
of protection from attack due to [its ability to adversely impact the
oil market by threatening the **Strait of**]{.underline}
**[Hormuz]{.underline}**. This "oil shield" means that if the US, Israel
or others seek to protect their security interests regarding nuclear
proliferation through military action against Iran, they could very well
harm their own, and the world's, economic interests at tne sanie tinie.
[Another consequence]{.underline} of the heavy reliance on oil usage
[can be seen in]{.underline} the level of [**increased violence and
terrorism** from non---state actors in the Middle East]{.underline}.
This has conic in many forms. [Iran has provided longstanding support to
several]{.underline} [organizations]{.underline} iii the Middle East.
[such as Hamas and Hezbollah]{.underline}, who have carried out violent
attacks against Israel. It is expected that such orgaiiiiations would he
even more emboldened by an Iran with nuclear weapons capabilities.
Terrorism also comes indirectly [from other oil---rich states such as
Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, where some portion of the
[petrodollars]{.underline} supplied by the US and other Western
consumers [finds its way into the coffers of]{.underline} organizations
such as [aL---Qaeda]{.underline} that are hostile to the US and its
allies. Petrodollars, at least indirectly, helped to pay for the attacks
of 9/11, as well as ongoing violence by non---state actors in che Middle
East.6 [In]{.underline} [addition, the fallout from US intervention in
Iraq]{.underline} [has led to the rise of ISIS]{.underline} and irs
brand of brutality, violence .uid terronsni [in Iraq and
Syna]{.underline}\_ [The organization's]{.underline} [ability to control
territory and people while **maintaining its fighting capacity**
is]{.underline} [due to]{.underline} the fàct that it finances its
operations predominantly from the sale of [oil]{.underline} (it is also
funded by private donors, "taxation" and extortion of captive
populations, seizure of assets in territories it controls, the sale of
plundered antiquities. kid--- napping ransoms, and the sale of women and
girls in the sex trade).7 This is only part of the list of threats the
United States can identify that tie to America's and/or the world's
energy usage. There are many other circumstances that the LIS would
rather avoid, though it) some cases, the LIS itself' is a coTltnbutor to
the problem it is seeking to address: . [Russian influence over Former
Soviet Republics and the rest of Europe]{.underline}. The taking of
Crimea and the conflict in eastern Ukraine [have taken place
amidst]{.underline} the renationalization of the energy sector in
Russia, and attempts by [Russia's]{.underline} leadership to reestablish
its global [influence through control over energy]{.underline}
[resources]{.underline}. To that end, Russia lias used energy as a tool
of its foreign policy. The energy giant Cazproin. of which 51% is owned
by the Russian gov ernment, has a relationship with the state such that
"Gazproni has become the Krenilin's fiuïthfiil servant and dangerous
sword, and the Krenthn has become Gazprom's protector.tN Russia. via
Gazproni (one of the world's largest energy producers), has repeatedly
cut oW gas supplies to Ukraine and other parts of Europe, it has sought
to gain control over the gas transporta--- tion infrastructure that used
to he part of the Soviet Union's gas supply system, arid it provides
price discounts to countries loyal to Moscow. . [The **growing
assertiveness**]{.underline} and assault on personal liberties

which earn most of their income from oil. In these states, rulers have
ensconced themselves by building up their security forces and taking
greater control of the media! while harassing, jailing and silencing
their critics. At the same time they use their oil revenues to buy off
and divide any potential opposition by providing subsidies and benefits
to citizens and interest groups. As Thomas Friedman of The New York
Times has described this relationship, a trip to the gas station is
effectively saying, 1111 er up with dictators.9 . Competitive arms
transfers and military assistance. Oil consumers have for years provided
military assistance to oil producers The US has done so with Saudi
Arabia for decades, and has in recent years done so among several
Central Asian republics. [China is]{.underline} the newest entrant into
this type of relationship, [providing arms to]{.underline} several
[countries in Africa and Central Asia]{.underline}. It has even been
accepting oil and minerals in lieu of cash to pay for military
equipment.1° These relationships strengthen ongoing relations, win favor
with suppliers, and help to secure favorable terms in supplying oil. .
[Venezuela's pursuit]{.underline} under President Hugo Chavez. and his
successor Nicolas Madura. [of an **anti-US bloc** in Latin America and
the Caribbean]{.underline}. The Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of
Our America, or ALBA, organized and funded by Venezuela, is an
association of eight countries seeking a level of regional economic
integration and ideological solidarity that stands in direct opposition
to US power and influence in the Western Hemisphere. . [Looking the
other way at human rights violations]{.underline}. [Oïl exporters like
Azerbaijan. Kazakhstan, Angola and Sudan receive support at the UN
andlor avoid probes into their violations of human rights]{.underline}.
The larger context to all these developments is that global [dependence
on oil **increases resource competition** as demands grow]{.underline}.
The United States and China have already experienced one instance of
this when the Chinese company CNOCC sought to purchase the American oil
company Unocal in 2006. The outcry in the US Congress was so swift and
loud that the sale was abandoned, but the example serves to underscore
the nationalistic feelings associated with securing energy supplies. [In
places]{.underline} [throughout the world, resource competition occurs
with growing frequency]{.underline}. [There are numerous **claims
to**]{.underline} oil resources in parts of **[the Arctic]{.underline}**
[that Canada asserts are]{.underline} part of [their territorial waters,
and by other countries who claim the]{.underline} undersea
[resources]{.underline} that lie in intemational waters. [**China and
its neighbors** have]{.underline} [made competing claims to the Spratly
Islands in the **S**]{.underline}outh **[C]{.underline}**hina
**[S]{.underline}**ea. [And **Japan and China**]{.underline} also
[have]{.underline} [competing claims to]{.underline} the Chunxiao [gas
fields in the]{.underline} **[E]{.underline}**ast
**[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea, which China has begun to
develop. This dispute was exacerbated by Japan's seizure of a Chinese
fishing boat in 2010 that was operating in waters controlled by Japan
but also claimed by China as well. The fishing boat incident prompted
China to cut off shipments of rare earth metals to Japan for a period of
time. Domestic Production of Fossil Fuels and National Security [Many of
the challenges the US faces abroad have a link,
**directly**]{.underline} or indirectly, [to]{.underline} the [worldwide
reliance]{.underline} [on oil and natural gas]{.underline}. [To the
extent that the United States is able to **add to the global
supply**]{.underline} [through]{.underline} [increased production of
both commodities at home]{.underline}, can [this **diminish
the**]{.underline} national **[security concerns noted
above]{.underline}**? What these newfound energy sources may mean in the
long term for US troop deployments overseas, the assertiveness of
oil-rich dictatorships, the threat of terrorism, and other national and
global security concerns remains to be seen, but there is little
question that [the ups and downs of the global oil]{.underline} [market,
along with the **actions taken by nations**]{.underline} around the
world **[in response]{.underline}** to this market, [have been **greatly
influenced**]{.underline} [by the American energy boom.]{.underline} It
is difficult, if not impossible. to prove a negative, but it is not
unreasonable to think that political [instability and active hostilities
in Iraq and Syria, upheaval]{.underline} and state failure [in Libya,
and concerns over Russia's]{.underline} use of [energy]{.underline} as a
political [weapon" would be **putting**]{.underline} **[upward pressure
on global oil prices]{.underline}** [in the absence of **increased US
production**]{.underline} [of oil and natural gas]{.underline}. [After
all, in the midst of all these conflicts, the increase in US petroleum
production]{.underline}. after several years of growth. [had the effect
in 2014 of pushing oil prices downward **very quickly**]{.underline}.
[They **dropped by more than**]{.underline} [**half** from]{.underline}
June [2014 to]{.underline} January [2015, from over \$100 to \$47 a
barrel]{.underline} in this timeframe.'3 [The growth of **unconventional
oil and gas production**]{.underline} [in the US has led to]{.underline}
a changing understanding about how energy security can potentially be
enhanced [Diminished reliance on foreign suppliers]{.underline} of oil,
along with the potential to export natural gas, suggest that [the United
States could be]{.underline} better [**insulated from disruptions** in
energy supply chains]{.underline} [that stretch around the
world]{.underline}, [while also **reducing the global impacts**
of]{.underline} such [disruptions]{.underline}. In other words, this is
expected to have the effect of [enhancing the]{.underline} **[abundance,
reliability and affordability]{.underline}** [of energy
supplies]{.underline}, while reducing national security vulnerabilities.
Moreover, this type of energy independence' (at best a misnomer, or at
least a term that means different things to different people) has been a
longstanding element of US energy policy. When one considers US military
involvement in the Middle East ever since the pronouncement of the
Carter Doctrine in 1979. and the adverse impact of conflict in the
region on energy supplies and fuel prices, the benefit is not
insignificant. Since the oil embargo of 1973, the American view has held
that the national security vulnerabilities inherent in US dependence on
oil are vast This view was clearly articulated in a report issued in
2006 by the Council on Foreign Relations entitled National Security
Consequences of U.S. Oil Dependency.'4 The task force that wrote the
report was chaired by John Deutch, who had served as CIA Director,
Deputy Secretary of Defense, and Undersecretary of Energy: and James
Schlesinger, who had served as CIA Director, Secretary of Defense. and
Secretary of Energy. If any publication could reflect the American
energy security worldview. this was it. Released in 2006. when US forces
were mired in Iraq, the country was importing two-thirds of its daily
petroleum needs, and oil prices were around \$80'bbl and on the rise,
the report pointed out the following problems (which had a heavy focus
on Iran): . "The Persian Gulf is a region that has been unstable and
includes countries that have periodically used their oil exports for
political purposes unfriendly to the United States." . '[Dependencies in
the world oil market empower oil rich countries]{.underline}---such as
Iran and Venezuela---[to carry out foreign policies that are hostile
to]{.underline} that of [the United States]{.underline}." . [Concern
about losing]{.underline} Iran's 2.5 million barrels per day of world
[oil exports will cause importing states]{.underline} to be reluctant
[to take action]{.underline} against Iran's nuclear program." . "France
and Germany, and with them much of [the European Union. are]{.underline}
more [reluctant to confront]{.underline} difficult issues with [Russia
and Iran because of]{.underline} their [dependence on imported oil and
gas]{.underline}." Cw'r'gflt r" . "[A large fraction of the world's
traded oil]{.underline} already [passes through a handful of strategic
choke points]{.underline}, [such as the Strait of Hormuz]{.underline}.
"The infrastructure for delivering oil has several potential weak links,
including [major oil processing]{.underline} [facilities]{.underline}
that [are]{.underline} vital yet [vulnerable to attack]{.underline} and
difficult to repair" . "Payments for oil lead to large dollar balances
built up by oil producers. '[petrodollars,' giv]{.underline}ing them

respect to **every one of these points**, the growth of US oil

with Russia on terrorism, and with China on North Korea. That help has
not materialized, which will be a test of Trump's mettle. If he fails to
take action against North Korea, and leaves his many concessions to
China in place, he got played. The North [Korean launches are the latest
in decades of events that show an **animosity of authoritarian rulers

disintegrated in the 1990s, many U.S. analysts saw democracy and
liberalism as triumphant over autocracy, and even presaged the "end of
history."]{.underline} Russia and China were proceeding toward market
liberalization and democratization. [The democratic peace would soon
take hold and the world would evolve in a utopic manner]{.underline},
they thought. But **[that dream now seems far-flung]{.underline}**,
[with low-grade Russian and Chinese offensives in Eastern Europe and
Asia respectively.]{.underline} [These offensives are calibrated in such
a manner as to make territorial gains]{.underline}, while not provoking
a military response. [They utilize alliances with Iran and **No**rth
**Ko**rea to **encourage rogue state action**]{.underline} that
distracts global public attention from Chinese and Russian territorial
offenses. Conversely, [the **U**nited **S**tates, Japan, **So**uth
**Ko**rea, Australia, the **E**uropean **U**nion and others are in a
relatively loose alliance based on the common values of democracy, human
rights, and freedom of speech. But the alliance is divided by the strong
democratic desire for peace, and domestic elites with individual
incentives to value trade and investment over the defense of values like
democracy.]{.underline} It is subject to free riding, which President
Trump has successfully pushed, including at an upcoming meeting in
Brussels on May 25. What could be called **[an autocratic bloc is
provoking, through territorial expansion and destabilizing nuclear
development, an interrelated set of conflicts developing in the
direction of a New Cold War between autocracies on one side, and
democracies on the other]{.underline}**. As with the old Cold War,
**[the locus of the conflict is everywhere]{.underline}**, including the
**[South China Sea]{.underline}**, **[East China Sea]{.underline}**,
**[North Korean and Iranian nuclear and ballistic missile
development]{.underline}**, the **[Russian occupation of

Georgia, **[China's attempt to push the U.S. out of Asia]{.underline}**
and claim it as a sphere of influence, the **[Arctic]{.underline}**,
**[space]{.underline}**, **[undersea exploration]{.underline}**, and
Russian and Chinese attempts to influence politicians and even voting
outcomes in democratic countries. To institutionalize its growing power
and leadership of autocratic countries, and many democratic hangers-on,
China attempts to reform global governance not through democratization
that might help countries like Japan, India, Brazil and Germany to
positions of greater influence in places like the U.N. Security Council,
but to uniquely reflect and accommodate China's own growing economic and
military power. **[Democracies are being challenged worldwide by this
autocratic bloc.]{.underline}** **[If democracies do not have a

strategy to defeat or at least deflect the challenge, democracies will
be weakened in such a way as to make future challenges even more

and path dependence greater than in defending democratic voting
processes from autocratic influence, and in defending front-line
democratic territory in places like Eastern Europe, the East China Sea,
the South China Sea, the Himalayas, and Taiwan. [Decisions on defensive

-trades off with intervention and war

**Yulis 17**. (Max Yulis, Penn Political Review. In Defense of Liberal
Internationalism. April 8, 2017.
pennpoliticalreview.org/2017/04/in-defense-of-liberal-internationalism/)

Over the past decade, international headlines have been bombarded with
stories about the unraveling of the post-Cold War world order, the
creation of revolutionary smart devices and military technologies, the
rise of militant jihadist organizations, and nuclear proliferation.
Indeed, **[times are paradoxically promising and
alarming]{.underline}**. [In relation to treating the world's ills,
fortunately, **there is a capable hegemon**-- one that has the ability
to **revive the world order** and traditionally hallmarked **human
rights, peace, and democracy**.]{.underline} **[The United
States]{.underline}**, [with all of its shortcomings]{.underline}, [had
crafted an international agenda that significantly impacted the
post-WWII landscape.]{.underline} **[Countries invested their ambitions
into security communities, international institutions, and international
law]{.underline}** in an effort **[to mitigate]{.underline}** the
**[chances of]{.underline}** a **[nuclear]{.underline}** catastrophe or
another World **[War]{.underline}**. The horrors and atrocities of the
two Great Wars had traumatized the global community, which spurred calls
for peace and the creation of a universalist agenda. T[oday, the world's
fickle and declining hegemon still has the **ability, but not the
will**, to uphold the world order that it had so carefully and eagerly
helped construct.]{.underline} Now, **[the stakes are too
high]{.underline}**, and **[there must be a mighty and willing global
leader to lead the effort of diffusing democratic ideals]{.underline}**
and reinforcing stability through both military and diplomatic means. To
do this, the United States must abandon its insurgent wave of
isolationism and protectionism, and come to grips with the newly
transnational nature of problems ranging from climate change to
international terrorism. First, the [increase in intra-state conflict
should warrant concern as many countries, namely in Africa and the
Middle East, are seeing the total **collapse of civil society and
government.** **These power vacuums are being filled with**]{.underline}
increasingly **[ideological and dangerous tribal and non-state
actors]{.underline}**, [such as **Boko Haram, ISIS, and
Al-Shabaab**]{.underline}. Other [bloody civil wars in Rwanda, Sudan,
and the Congo have contributed to the deaths of millions]{.underline} in
the past two decades. As [the West has seen, however, military
intervention has not been all that successful]{.underline} in building
and empowering democratic institutions in the Far East. **[A civil
crusade]{.underline}**, along [with the **strengthening of international
institutions,** may in fact be the answer to undoing tribal, religious,
and sectarian divisions, thereby mitigating the prospects of civil
conflict]{.underline}. During the Wilsonian era, missionaries did their
part to internationalize the concept of higher education, which has
contributed to the growth of universities in formerly underdeveloped
countries such as China and South Korea.\[1\] In addition, the teachings
of missionaries emphasized the universality of humanity and the oneness
of man, which was antithetical to the justifications for imperialism and
the rampant sectarianism that plagued much of the Middle East and
Africa.\[2\] [Seeing that an increase in the magnitude of human casualty
is becoming more of a reality due to advancements in military technology
and the increasing outbreaks of civil war, **international cooperation
and the diffusion of norms that highlight the importance of stable
governance, democracy, and human rights is the only recourse to address
the rise in sectarian divides and civil conflicts**. So long as the
trend of the West's desire to **look inward** continues]{.underline},
[it is likely]{.underline} that [nation states mired in conflict will
devolve into ethnic or tribal enclaves bent on **relying on war to
maintain their legitimacy** and power]{.underline}. Aside from growing
sectarianism and the increasing prevalence of failed states, [an even
more daunting threat come from **weapons that transcend the costs of
conventional warfare.**]{.underline} The problem of nuclear
proliferation has been around for decades, and on the eve of President
Trump's inauguration, it appeared that Obama's lofty goal of advocating
for nonproliferation would no longer be a priority of American foreign
policy.\[3\] In addition, [now that the American president is
threatening to undo much of the United States' extensive network of
alliances, formerly non-nuclear states may be forced to rearm
themselves]{.underline}. **[Disarmament is central to liberal
internationalism]{.underline}**, [as was apparent by the Washington
Naval Treaty advocated by Wilson, and by the modern CTBT
treaty]{.underline}. The reverse is, however, being seen in the modern
era, with cries coming from Japan and South Korea to remobilize and
begin their own nuclear weapon programs.\[4\] [A world with more nuclear
actors is a formula for chaos, especially if nuclear weapons become
mass-produced.]{.underline} [Non-state actors will increasingly eye
these nuclear sites as was the case near a Belgian nuclear]{.underline}
power [plant]{.underline} just over a year ago.\[5\] [If any government
commits a serious misstep, **access to nuclear weapons on the behalf of
terrorist and insurgent groups will become a reality,** especially if a
civil war occurs]{.underline}. States with nuclear weapons require
domestic stability and strong security, which is why [states such as
Israel, North Korea, and Pakistan could be in serious trouble in the
event of a domestic uprising or military coup]{.underline}. The
disarmament of all states is essential for human survival, and if it is
not achieved, then **[a world full of nuclear weapons and an
international system guided by realpolitik could give rise to nuclear
warfare.]{.underline}** In today's world, nuclear weapons leave all
states virtually defenseless. But, **[for nuclear deproliferation to
become a cornerstone of the global agenda, a pacifying and democratic
power must rise to the limelight to advocate the virtues of peace,
stability, and human rights]{.underline}**. [**Those who equivocate
democratic interventionism as an idealistic crusade cannot be further
from the truth.** Some]{.underline}, however, see [it as an effective
foreign policy that has a grand scheme for peace in
mind]{.underline}.\[6\] [The latter contention]{.underline}, despite
being widely disputed, **[holds the premise for the democratic peace
theory]{.underline}**. Throughout the history of all democracies, **[not
one modern-day democracy has fought against another
democracy]{.underline}**.\[7\] [Whether that's because of ideational
symmetry, similar objectives and morals, or generally pacific foreign
policies, **such a phenomenon must be given attention by
policymakers**]{.underline}**.** According to liberal internationalists,
**[democracies make better partners,]{.underline}** tend to **[move
towards increased political and moral agreement]{.underline}**,
[**oppose illiberal regimes**, and]{.underline} **[support disarmament
policies.]{.underline}** [This supposition is heavily supported by the
smooth post-WWII transitions that the German, Japanese, and Italian
governments underwent]{.underline}. [All of the governments were
formerly fascistic and authoritarian, but with intensive military and
economic support from the West, they became some of the most **shining
exemplars of democratic societies**.]{.underline} Even today, [Germany
is the backbone of the European Union and repeatedly champions
democratic norms]{.underline}, such as human rights, economic freedom,
and individual liberty.\[8\] Equipping other countries with the
necessary foundations for democracy is no easy feat, but **[the fight
for peace far outweighs the costs of inhabiting a world rife with
nuclear-armed authoritarian and belligerent states]{.underline}**. In
conclusion, liberal internationalism can have a lasting legacy on the
prospects for peace if it is executed properly. **[Putting democracy,
humanism, and liberty on a pedestal is what states ought to do if they
seek to save humanity from itself]{.underline}**. Although **[the rise
of transnational issues pertaining to climate change, nuclear weapons,
and civil wars should make international cooperation an increasingly
desired aim]{.underline}**, states seem to be thinking just the
opposite. Only time will tell whether this is a short-lived trend, or a
more ominous warning for the world at large.

**[Drawing from]{.underline}** the **[empirical literature, this paper
identifies]{.underline}** two **[underlying pathways through
which]{.underline}** state **[governance]{.underline}** systems help to
**[build peace. These are: State capacity. If states lack]{.underline}**
the **[ability to execute]{.underline}** their **[policy goals or to
maintain security]{.underline}** and public order **[in the face of
potentially violent groups, armed conflict is more likely. State
capacity refers to two significant aspects: security capacity and social
capacity. Security capacity includes]{.underline}** the **[ability to
control territory and resist armed incursion from other states and
nonstate actors. Social capacity includes the ability to provide social
services and public goods. Institutional quality. Research
suggests]{.underline}** that **[not all governance systems are equally
effective or capable of supporting peace. Governance systems are seen as
more credible and legitimate, and are better at supporting peace,
when]{.underline}** they are **[characterized by inclusiveness,
representativeness, transparency, and accountability]{.underline}**. In
particular, systems allowing citizens to voice concerns, participate
politically, and hold elected leaders accountable are more stable and
better able to avoid armed conflict. **[Both
dimensions]{.underline}**---state capacity and quality---**[are crucial
to]{.underline}** the **[prevention of armed conflict]{.underline}** and
are the focus of part one of this paper. Part two of the paper focuses
on **[democracy as the most common way of structuring state government
to allow for inclusive systems while maintaining state capacity.
The]{.underline}** two **[parts summarize important research findings
on]{.underline}** the **[features of governance that are most strongly
associated with prospects for peace. Our analysis, based
on]{.underline}** an **[extensive review of empirical literature, seeks
to identify]{.underline}** the **[specific dimensions of
governance]{.underline}** that are **[most strongly associated with
peace. We show evidence of a direct link between peace and a state's
capacity to both exert control over its territory and provide a full
range of social services through effective governance
institutions]{.underline}**. We apply a governance framework to examine
three major factors associated with the outbreak of war---border
disputes, ethnic conflict, and dependence on commodity exports---and
emphasize the importance of inclusive and representative governance
structures for the prevention of armed conflict.

### Impact Ext---International Law 

#### Compliance breakdown causes great power conflict 

Heath **Pickering 14**, MA, International Relations, Melbourne School of
Government, 2/4/14, "Why Do States Mostly Obey International Law?,"
<http://www.e-ir.info/2014/02/04/why-do-states-mostly-obey-international-law/>

[All states in the contemporary world,]{.underline} [including **great
powers**]{.underline}, [are compelled to justify their behaviour
according to legal rules and accepted norms]{.underline}. This essay
will analyse the extent to which states comply and the reasons for their
compliance. Essentially, the extent to which states follow their
international obligations has developed over the past 400 years. From a
historical perspective, international obligations and accepted norms
were founded following two key developments in European history. In
1648, the Treaty of Westphalia ended the Thirty Years' War by
acknowledging the sovereign authority of various European princes.\[1\]
This event marked the advent of traditional international law, based on
principles of territoriality and state autonomy. Then in 1945, again
following major wars initiated in Europe, states began to integrate on a
global scale.\[2\] The UN Charter became the international framework for
which norms of sovereignty and non-intervention were enshrined. Now, as
a result of modern technology, communication, transport, and more, the
evolving process of [Globalisation]{.underline}, "The
internationalization of the world",\[3\] [has provided an opportunity
for international law and accepted norms to reach **every corner of the
globe**]{.underline}.¶ However, the development of international law and
accepted norms has not compelled states to comply all the time. Instead,
the trend over the past 400 years has shown that [states have been
mostly compelled to justify their behavior according to legal rules and
accepted norms]{.underline}. The emphasis on mostly should be stressed.
Even though the UN Charter does not permit violating sovereignty through
the use of aggression, the extent to which states follow their
international obligations varies. Louis Henkin's book, How Nations
Behave, articulates the extent of compliance.\[4\] He said, "[Almost all
nations observe almost all principles of international law and almost
all of their obligations **almost all the time**]{.underline}".\[5\] [As
such,]{.underline} [the trend in contemporary international
relations]{.underline} [is that]{.underline} **[war remains
possible]{.underline}**, [but it is much **less acceptable**
now]{.underline} than it was a century or even half a century ago.\[6\]
The benefit of the trend is that [almost full compliance is said to lead
states into a pattern of obedience and **predictable
behaviour**]{.underline}.\[7\] [Therefore]{.underline}, [conflict only
arises when countries fail to comply]{.underline}.¶ [States]{.underline}
attempt to [manage]{.underline} the [friction]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} [ongoing compliance]{.underline}
[through]{.underline} the principle of pacta sunt servanda -- the
[adherence to agreements]{.underline}.\[8\] Over time, such agreements
to norms and treaties have diminished sovereignty, increased
international institutions, given rise to non-state actors, and rapidly
developed the contemporary customary and treaty based rules system.\[9\]
The evolution of the dispute-settlement procedures of the World Trade
Organisation (WTO), the establishment of the International Criminal
Court (ICC), and the establishment of numerous global treaties
illustrate states agreeing voluntarily to give up a portion of their
sovereignty.

#### Its reverse-causal- an effective international treaty system maintains global stability 

David **Knowlton 13**, professor of anthropology at Utah Valley
University, 7/27/13, "Knowlton: Disregarding international law,"
http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/opinion/56579033-82/international-snowden-countries-law.html.csp

**[Global stability depends]{.underline}** [on]{.underline} [checks and
balances on power]{.underline} [in the relationships among countries as
well as a fragile set of norms]{.underline}, often [called international
law]{.underline}, **[established through treaties]{.underline}**. Both
have been thrown out of whack, at a time when the world\'s institutions
are stressed. ¶ The Snowden effect --- his leaks and subsequent
reporting --- opened eyes everywhere on the ordinary surveillance of
communications throughout the world carried out by the United States and
allies with the aid of U.S.-based global telecommunication corporations.
It also is leading to diplomatic fallout, and increasing tension in
international relationships. ¶ In a telling example, on July 3 the plane
of Bolivian President Evo Morales was denied permission to fly over
several European countries and, as a result, was forced to land in
Vienna, Austria, where it was delayed for 18 hours and searched. The
European countries suspected Snowden was on board and wanted to catch
him. ¶ In the process, international law and treaties were violated.
This could be seen as an act of war. It suggests the desire to capture
Snowden took precedence over the legal structure of national sovereignty
and inviolability of heads of state. ¶ As a result, Bolivia is calling
for the structure of international relations to be reexamined and
renegotiated, especially if a handful of nations (probably at the
insistence of the United States) could freely violate the norms of
international respect and sovereignty. ¶ Generally, such a call from a
small country would not be heeded. However, the circumstances today are
different. ¶ Morales\' call comes when, [at one level, the power of the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has never been
greater]{.underline} (as the NSA scandal illustrates). [On another
level]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} set of [organizations
that]{.underline} **[guaranteed stability]{.underline}** [are shifting
in ways that no longer guarantee the maintenance of the standard
order]{.underline}. ¶ The detention of a president of a sovereign
country has been condemned by almost all South American countries,
except for the two or three in the pocket of the United States. Even
among them, serious concerns have been expressed. These have been taken
to The Union of South American Nations. ¶ Interestingly, UNASUR already
has taken the unusual step of openly breaking with the United States. In
2008, it supported Morales against a coup attempt --- widely seen as
having U.S. support --- aimed at checking the spread of leftist
governments in the region. The Monroe Doctrine that had been at the base
of hemispheric stability became tattered as a result. ¶ Furthermore, on
July 9, the Permanent Council of the Organization of American States
condemned the detention of Morales as an illegal action against the
inviolability of a head of state. The OAS has generally been seen as one
of the keys of building hemispheric stability and U.S. power in the
Americas. ¶ Instead of being ignored, Bolivia\'s call for [a
reconsideration of international treaties, and hence the order keeping
the world stable, is more likely to be heeded]{.underline}. [As a
result,]{.underline} [U.S. power may be more and more simply military
and economic,]{.underline} [instead of being grounded in a bevy of
treaties and organizations]{.underline} [that made this country less
overwhelming and violent]{.underline}.

### Alliances AO

#### Alliances preserve great power [stability]{.underline}\-\--causes [allied]{.underline} and US [restraints]{.underline} that reduces [unnecessary]{.underline} wars

[The]{.underline} second [myth that]{.underline} Trump's statements feed
is that United States' alliances provide minimal benefits. Individuals
who agree with this argue that [Washington's]{.underline} [commitments
to]{.underline} its [friends]{.underline} both [limit]{.underline}
[America's ability to establish]{.underline} its [supremacy and **entrap
it into conflict**]{.underline} [because of contractual
obligations]{.underline}. Consequently, by retrenching from formal
defense pacts, the United States could elongate its unipolar status.
**[Inverting this logic]{.underline}**, however[, shows the reality of
the situation]{.underline}. First, [allies **limiting**]{.underline}
[American primacy is a **net benefit**]{.underline}. Frankly, [reducing
the **amount of war**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[conflict]{.underline}** [is inherently **advantageous**]{.underline},
[and can preserve U.S.]{.underline} economic and military
[strength]{.underline}. In his 2015 article, " The Myth of Entangling
Alliances ," Michael Beckley argues that [U.S. defense pacts **reduce
the risks of conflict**]{.underline}. This is because, [by having many
allies across the world]{.underline}, [America faces **conflicting
commitments**]{.underline} [and needs to **restrain**]{.underline}
itself **[militarily]{.underline}** [so that it can satisfy these
varying agreements**. The offsetting obligations allow Washington to
avoid unnecessary conflict**]{.underline}. Thus, similar to investment
portfolios, **[America's]{.underline}** significant number of
[**alliances reduce the risk of future war.**]{.underline} Furthermore,
[because of Washington's dominant position]{.underline} [in]{.underline}
its [alliance hierarchies, it can effectively **restrain**]{.underline}
its **[allies]{.underline}** [from great conflicts]{.underline}.
[Smaller countries]{.underline} that [do not want to
increase]{.underline} their [security risk will **not** engage in wars
that]{.underline} their [**stronger** allies wish to avoid]{.underline}.
These small countries see a security benefit from great power alliances,
and the former is subservient to the latter. For example, in Asia after
World War II, [Washington restrained South Korea from attacking North
Korea and Taiwan from fighting China via threats to reduce
American]{.underline} military and economic [support]{.underline}.
Moreover, the **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[threatened to end]{.underline} its [arms sales to Iran, thus forcing
Tehran to avoid joining the]{.underline} 1973 oil [embargo]{.underline}.
Accordingly, [America's alliances provide it **leverage**]{.underline}
[that increases its **immediate security** and **decrease global
conflict.**]{.underline} Overall, Trump and other critics fundamentally
misunderstand the benefit to the U.S. alliance network. [NATO
and]{.underline} other [allies serve to maintain the current
**rules-based international order**]{.underline}, [reduce **Washington's
risk of war,**]{.underline} [and decrease **levels of global
conflict**]{.underline}. Therefore, abandoning U.S. allies under the
guise of "America first" would harm American security, and just mean
"America alone."

strength**]{.underline} today. [What is lacking is the
**will**]{.underline}. The will [to make the case to the American
people, the will to take risks and invest in the long-term security of
the country, and the world. This will require investments in aid, in
education, in security that allow countries to attain the stability
their people so badly need. Such investment is far more moral and far
cheaper than the cycle of **terror**, **war**, **refugees**, and
**military intervention** that results when **America leaves a vacuum**
of power. The best way to help refugees is to prevent them from becoming

forces of the past are making steady progress against the modern world
order. **Terrorist movements in the Middle East**, **extremist parties

Republican, Reagan. [This bipartisan consistency created the decades of
strategic stability that is the great strength of democracies. Strong
institutions that outlast politicians allow for long-range planning. In
contrast, dictators can operate only tactically, not strategically,
because they are not constrained by the balance of powers, but cannot
afford to think beyond their own survival. This is why a dictator like
Putin has an advantage in chaos, the ability to move quickly. This can
only be met by strategy, by long-term goals that are based on shared

WASHINGTON --- A controversial [arms deal for Arab allies]{.underline}
approved by the Trump administration [will allow]{.underline} [U.S.
hi-tech bomb]{.underline} [**parts to be manufactured** in Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}, [giving]{.underline} Riyadh unprecedented [access
to a sensitive weapons technology]{.underline}. The [production
arrangement]{.underline} [is part of]{.underline} a larger [\$8.1
billion arms package]{.underline} [for Saudi Arabia,]{.underline} the
United Arab Emirates and Jordan announced two weeks ago. The Trump
administration pressed ahead with the sale without congressional
approval, declaring an \"emergency\" based on what it said was a
heightened threat from Iran. The deal came as a surprise to lawmakers,
who were outraged that the administration chose to bypass Congress. But
most members of Congress only learned days after the [deal]{.underline}
was announced May 24 that it [opens the door]{.underline} [for Saudi
Arabia to host the production of electronic guidance and control systems
for Paveway precision-guided bombs]{.underline}, congressional aides
said. The New York Times first reported on the co-production
arrangement. Lawmakers are expected to grill a senior State Department
official --- R. Clarke Cooper, assistant secretary of state for
political-military affairs --- about the arms deal and the bomb
production plan at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing Wednesday.
The U.S. government tends to closely guard technology linked to
sophisticated weapons, and limits how much of that technology is shared
through co-production projects with other countries. Lawmakers opposed
to the deal said the production scheme sent the wrong signal to Saudi
Arabia given its human rights record and its air war in Yemen, raised
security concerns about sharing so-called \"smart bomb\" technology with
Riyadh and undercut one of President Donald Trump\'s arguments for
selling weapons to the Saudis --- to generate jobs in the United States.
\"The concerns over this sale are only one more reason showing the
importance of congressional review and why it is deeply disturbing that
the Trump administration is trying to circumvent the law and Congress to
give the Saudis not only American jobs but also American weapons
technology,\" Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the ranking Democrat on
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said. The co-production plan had
raised eyebrows among some lawmakers more than a year ago when the
administration first tried to secure approval for tens of thousands of
precision-guided bombs to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, a
Democratic congressional aide told NBC News. Menendez held up the sale
of 120,000 precision-guided bombs for Saudi Arabia and the UAE last year
because of numerous accounts of civilian casualties from Saudi-led air
raids in Yemen. The senator has said the administration failed to
persuade him that selling more of the so-called \"smart\" bombs would
prevent more civilian deaths. Human rights, U.N. investigators and aid
groups have accused Saudi Arabia and its allies of striking civilian
targets, including hospitals and schools, in indiscriminate bombing
raids in Yemen since Riyadh launched an armed intervention against
Houthi rebels in 2015. Congressional resistance to weapons sales to
Saudi Arabia only grew after the killing last year of Saudi writer and
Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in
Istanbul. [The Trump administration has defended the arms sale as a way
of ensuring Arab allies can defend themselves amid an allegedly
increased danger from Iran]{.underline}, and that Washington\'s
credibility as a military partner was at risk if it did not deliver
spare parts and other weapons promptly. U.S. officials privately have
also said that maintaining arms sales helps Washington exert a
constructive influence over the kingdom. A State Department official,
who was not authorized to speak on the record, said the production
arrangement \"is not something we would have licensed if we were not
fully confident in both the Saudi ability to protect the technology, as
well as the positive impact on the American defense industrial base.\"
Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, an outspoken critic of U.S.
support for the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen, condemned the production
arrangement. \"[To think that we would co-produce these bombs and in
turn contribute to an arms race, regional instability, and civilian
deaths is unfathomable]{.underline},\" Murphy said. \"Congress needs to
put a stop to the way we do business with the Saudis and start acting
like the senior partner in this relationship rather than succumbing to
whatever the kingdom wants.\" \"A secretive monarchy that commits
atrocities in Yemen, that murders dissidents and journalists and lies to
the world about it, and that treats women as property is not one to
which we should be giving some of our most sensitive military
technology,\" Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said. The Paveway bombs can
strike a target within 10 feet when fired from 40,000 feet, according to
William Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the
Washington-based Center for International Policy, and will almost
certainly be used in the war in Yemen. \"The weapons are going to be put
to use in a civilian slaughter,\" he said. [The deal fits in with Saudi
Arabia\'s long term economic plan, Saudi Vision 2030, which calls for
the country to dramatically increase its domestic arms production.
\"They are trying to build up their own military manufacturing base,\"
Hartung said]{.underline}. But [the assembly of bomb parts in the
kingdom raises security and proliferation questions for the United
States]{.underline}, he added. \"[If they can master the production
process, they could sell it.]{.underline}\"

The [U.S. Defense Department]{.underline} [announced]{.underline} March
4 that [it]{.underline} recently [awarded Lockheed Martin]{.underline} a
nearly \$1 billion [contrac]{.underline}t [to begin work]{.underline}
[on a]{.underline} [Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)
ballistic missile defense]{.underline} [package for Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}. The **[contract marks the start]{.underline}** of a
\$15 billion deal **[for the kingdom to receive 44 THAAD
batteries]{.underline}**, including 360 missile interceptors. The
contract followed November 2018 letters of offer and acceptance between
the United States and Saudi Arabia formalizing terms for the sale of the
THAAD launchers, missiles, and related equipment. The \$15 billion
package is part of a larger \$110 billion weapons deal that the United
States negotiated with Saudi leaders in 2017. The November letters were
exchanged as the United States was under political pressure to reduce
defense cooperation with Saudi Arabia following the October 2018 murder
of Jamal Khashoggi, a commentator for The Washington Post, and amid
concerns about U.S. support for Saudi military actions in Yemen. [The
initial sale was approved by the State Department]{.underline} and
Congress in August 2017 and November 2017, respectively, when there was
speculation that Riyadh was negotiating to purchase Russian S-400 air
defense systems. Russian-Saudi talks on an S-400 transfer remain
underway this year, according to Alexander Mikheyev, chief executive
officer of Russia's state arms exporter Rosoboronexport.---SHERVIN

#### THAAD purchases by Saudi Arabia fuel [Iranian military modernization]{.underline} emboldening Saudi-Iranian tensions 

**Stein 19** \[Aaron Stein is the Director of the Middle East Program at
the Foreign Policy Research Institute, "Middle East Missile Race: The
Missile Defense Review, Iran, and the Implications for the Gulf",
January 24, 2019,
https://www.fpri.org/article/2019/01/middle-east-missile-race-the-missile-defense-review-iran-and-the-implications-for-the-gulf/,
DOA: 6/9/19 GMDI

Despite these challenges, individual [GCC states remain
committed]{.underline} [to purchasing]{.underline} and fielding Patriot
and [Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD]{.underline})
[anti-missile systems]{.underline}. These two systems are designed for
different purposes: Patriot is designed for point defense from
medium-range ballistic missiles (which have ranges between 1,000 and
3,000 km), whereas THAAD can defend a larger area and engage faster
flying intermediate-range ballistic missiles (3,000 to 5,500 km range).
Saudi Arabia has deployed Patriot, has committed to upgrading its
current missiles to the most advanced PAC-3 interceptor, and has
expressed interest in THAAD. The United Arab Emirates, too, has
purchased Patriot and deployed the more advanced PAC-3 version to a
staging base in Djibouti to protect its forces from Houthi missile
attack. Emirati forces also operate THAAD. Qatar will soon begin
operating Patriot and hosts a U.S. TPY-2 radar, which is used to track
and cue missile interceptors, while Kuwait has operated (and hosted)
Patriot for decades. [The proliferation of ballistic missile
defense]{.underline} [has prompted Iranian countermoves]{.underline},
[designed to ensure that its missiles can defeat U.S.-made
defenses]{.underline}. To do so, Iran is pursuing four distinct
approaches. First, [Tehran is investing in more short- and medium-range
missiles]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} [when fired]{.underline} [in
large numbers would]{.underline} [overwhelm and defeat the]{.underline}
comparatively [smaller number of missile defense systems
deployed]{.underline}. Second, [Iran is experimenting with]{.underline}
creative and [asymmetric approaches to attack missile defense
radars]{.underline}, [including with low-tech]{.underline},
off-the-shelf [drones]{.underline} that have reportedly been used in
Yemen to target Patriot radars. Third, recent imagery from a Qiam
missile launch in September 2018 shows small fins at the base of the
re-entry vehicle, which could possibly [indicate an interest in
developing]{.underline} some [late-stage maneuvering capabilities to
defeat terminal missile defense]{.underline}, or, at the very least, to
improve stability and increase precision. Finally, [the Islamic Republic
remains interested in the further development of cruise missiles. These
missiles fly low to the ground and, therefore, pose a challenge for
missile defenses designed to track and engage targets flying a ballistic
trajectory]{.underline}. There are also indications that Iran is more
confident using its ballistic missiles. In June 2017, Iran fired 6
missiles at targets in Syria, two, of which, the solid-fuel Zolfaqhar
missile, hit impact points in Mayadeen, a small town the Islamic State
formerly held in eastern Syria. To monitor battle damage, and then for
propaganda purposes, Iran filmed the impacts with a Shahed-129 drone
deployed in Syria, as part of the Iranian support given to the Syrian
regime. Following the strike in Syria, Iran used ballistic missiles to
strike the headquarters of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran
(KDP-I) in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The Islamic Republic has also
transferred the Qiam ballistic missile to the Houthis in Yemen and has
struck targets throughout the Kingdom, including Riyadh. The war in
Yemen has underscored the difficulty of finding and targeting mobile
missiles before they are launched. The Saudi-led coalition has the tools
to search for missiles on the ground, but the Houthis have still managed
to fire Qiam missiles at least eight times since July 2017 without being
detected from the air. Despite these challenges, it is important for the
defender to include counterforce, specifically the ability to target
missiles before they are launched, in the broader effort to defend
against missile attack. For Iran, the lessons-lessons-learned from the
first Gulf War, when the United States dedicated considerable resources
(albeit with limited success) to find and attack Iraqi Scud missiles
before they were launched, probably informed thinking about future
missile development. Despite the challenges the U.S. faced in actually
finding Iraqi Scuds, investments to ensure that missiles remain
survivable from detection and air attack in the future, when U.S.
sensors and capabilities are certain to improve, probably drove Iranian
interests in fielding a more mobile missile force. In the late-1990s,
the Emirati Air Force purchased the Franco-British air-launched cruise
missile SCALP/Storm Shadow for Mirage and Tornado aircraft---a useful
weapon to target air defense sites and to hit targets of convenience at
long range. Following the Emirati purchase, Saudi Arabia purchased the
same missile in the mid-2000s. As Jeffrey Lewis noted, the United States
objected to the sale of the missile to the UAE in the 1990s because it
violated the voluntary guidelines under the Missile Technology Control
Regime (MTCR), which established a common presumption against the export
of missiles capable of carrying a 500 kg payload to more than 300 km.
The United States was less vocal in its criticism of the Saudi purchase,
but that appears to be linked to the fact that the United Kingdom kept
the sale under wraps and never talked much about it. [However, as is the
case with the spread of missile defense, it appears as if the spread of
more accurate cruise missiles for countries in the Gulf has sparked an
Iranian counter]{.underline}, [focused on the development of
solid-fueled missiles]{.underline}. [This fuel type is more
operationally flexible than liquid fuel because solid-fueled missiles
can be stored and transported fully fueled without the larger supporting
infrastructure needed to fire liquid-fueled missiles]{.underline}. [One
benefit, of course, is that the aerial signature for solid-fueled
missiles is much smaller, which makes them harder to hit before
launch]{.underline}. [Iran's interests in solid-fueled missiles, like
the Zolfaqhar, may be indicative of the missile race in the region,
wherein each side's effort to counter the other prompts further
technological developments to offset any advantage]{.underline}. As the
United States develops strategies for regional missile defense, and
announces plans in the MDR about how to use missile defense to enhance
partnerships with regional allies, [it is worth noting how the Islamic
Republic has responded to incremental American changes in
strategy]{.underline}. Rather than try to overcome U.S. technological
dominance, [Iran is using low-cost means to counter sophisticated
defenses and developing missiles to try to evade]{.underline} ever-more
capable [precision-guided weapons]{.underline} [and sophisticated
sensors]{.underline}. [This is certain to continue]{.underline}, [given
that the Gulf Arab element of the MDR repeats the long-standing American
effort to make regional defenses more
capable]{.underline}---[a]{.underline}n entirely reasonable
[strategy]{.underline}, but one [destined to invite countermoves by
Iran]{.underline}. Over the longer term, the importance of missiles for
national defense---whether for offense or defense---shows little signs
of abating. Instead, recent events in Iran and the Gulf underscore how
important missiles are becoming for a wide swathe of countries'
self-defined national security priorities. [These dynamics point to a
near-term missile race in the Middle East, an outcome that could further
destabilize a region rife with conflict.]{.underline}

#### Arms sales to Saudi Arabia fuels Iranian threat constructions -- enabling Saudi adventurism 

**Wezeman 18** \[Pieter D. Wezeman is a Senior Researcher with the SIPRI
Arms Transfers and Military Expenditure Programme, "Saudi Arabia,
armaments and conflict in the Middle East", December 14, 2018,

DOA: 6/9/19 GMDI

Lack of transparency in military matters makes it difficult to determine
the extent to which Saudi Arabia's high levels of military spending and
arms procurement are driven by defensive or offensive motives, military
or prestige considerations, internal power play or the possibility for
government officials to [enrich
themselves](http://government.defenceindex.org/countries/saudi-arabia/).
However, [it is clear that Saudi Arabia is]{.underline} [no longer just
stocking up on weapons]{.underline}. [It is]{.underline} actually [using
them on a large scale in]{.underline} an offensive operation in
[Yemen]{.underline}. [Preparations for]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
[future use of armed force]{.underline} [elsewhere]{.underline} should
not be excluded as [a motive for the]{.underline} continuing [high level
of militarization]{.underline}. Saudi Arabia might perceive its failure
to win the war in Yemen as an indication of the limitations of its
military arsenal. On the other hand, [it could perceive the operations
in Yemen as preventing a complete takeover of Yemen by allies of
Iran]{.underline}, forcing the Houthi rebels to agree on negotiations
and providing an opportunity for its armed forces to gain significant
experience of warfare. [Such perceptions combined with further arms
acquisitions that enhance the reach and strike power of its armed forces
may embolden the Saudi leadership to view the use of force as an
increasingly central part of its foreign policy]{.underline}, [regional
power aspirations and responses to real or perceived threats from, among
others, Iran, Qatar, or internal groups]{.underline}. As Yemen
dramatically illustrates, [there are major risks for national and
regional security, stability, peace, development and the humanitarian
situation that relate to militarized foreign and security policies in
the Middle East]{.underline}. States should therefore reassess the
possible short- and long-term consequences of their arms exports to
Saudi Arabia, ensure that a questionable narrative of economic gain does
not drive such arms sales and consider if and how arms supplies can have
a role at all in conflict resolution in the Middle East

#### That draws in great powers and causes Middle East Instability

Judging from appearances, the United States and Iran are worryingly
close to conflict. This weekend, only days after the United States
dispatched warships and bombers to the Middle East to deter what it
deemed Iranian threats, two Saudi oil tankers and a Norwegian ship were
damaged in apparent acts of sabotage in the Persian Gulf. The dispute
between a U.S. administration led by a tough-talking Republican
president and an embattled but antagonistic Middle Eastern power has
reminded many observers of the run-up to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq
in 2003 --- a move that, in the years since, has been widely condemned
as disastrous for all involved. Even some of the characters in this
apparent remake are the same: John Bolton, President Trump's national
security adviser, played a key role in President George W. Bush's
buildup to the Iraq invasion as undersecretary of state for arms control
and international security. Bolton's actions at the time earned him a
reputation as reckless. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif
appeared to allude to him on Tuesday, telling reporters that "extremist
individuals in the U.S. administration" were falsely trying to blame
Iran for the incidents in the Persian Gulf. Despite the similarities, [a
conflict with Iran]{.underline} [would]{.underline} [not]{.underline}
simply [be a redux of the 2003 war with Iraq]{.underline}. [It would
be]{.underline} quite [different]{.underline} in many ways --- [and
it]{.underline} [would]{.underline} almost certainly [be]{.underline}
substantially [worse]{.underline}. Present-day [Iran]{.underline} [is
a]{.underline} significantly [different country compared to Iraq in
2003]{.underline}. The way it would fight a war is very different, too.
If nothing else, [Iran]{.underline} [is]{.underline} simply [a bigger
country]{.underline} than Iraq was before the 2003 invasion. At the
time, Iraq's population was about 25 million. [Iran's population
is]{.underline} estimated to be [more than 82 million]{.underline}.
[Iran spans 591,000 square miles of land, compared with Iraq's 168,000
square miles]{.underline}. One estimate from 2005 suggested the Iraqi
army had fewer than 450,000 personnel when the invasion began. Recent
estimates suggest that Iran has 523,000 active military personnel, as
well as 250,000 reserve personnel. Just as important, however, is Iran's
location. Unlike Iraq, Iran is a maritime power bordered by the Caspian
sea to the north and the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman to the south.
It shares land borders with several troubled U.S. allies, including
Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkey and Iraq. [Its location in the center of
Eurasia is]{.underline} particularly [important for trade]{.underline}.
About [a third of the world's]{.underline} [oil tanker traffic passes
through the Strait of Hormuz,]{.underline} [which is bordered by
Iran]{.underline} and Oman. [At]{.underline} its [narrowest
point]{.underline}, this [shipping route is just]{.underline} under [two
miles wide]{.underline}. [Blocking it]{.underline} [could lead shipments
of daily global oil exports to drop by]{.underline} an estimated [30
percent]{.underline}. In terms of conventional military strength,
[Iran]{.underline} is far weaker than the United States. But the country
[has long pursued asymmetric strategies]{.underline} [that]{.underline}
could [allow it to inflict serious damage on U.S. interests]{.underline}
in the region. Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, a force loyal to Iran's
supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and separate from the regular
military, has an external [special operations arm]{.underline} [known as
the Quds Force]{.underline} that has [helped build proxy forces in
places such as Iraq, Lebanon and Syria]{.underline}. It funds militias
such as Hezbollah, which is powerful in its own right. Iran has used
these type of groups to target Americans before. Earlier this year, a
revised Pentagon estimate found Iranian proxy forces had killed at least
608 U.S. troops in Iraq between 2003 and 2011. [Iranian proxies could
cause havoc in Iraq and Afghanistan again]{.underline}. [Iran's navy has
a]{.underline} real [advantage against the United States]{.underline},
too. [It doesn't need big ships]{.underline} or firepower [to
block]{.underline} off the [Strait of Hormuz]{.underline}, for example,
[but could use mines or submarines to force a halt in
trade]{.underline}. [U.S. war games]{.underline} [have suggested that
speedboat suicide attacks and missiles could be]{.underline}
surprisingly [effective against the American military]{.underline}. A
2017 report from the Office of Naval Intelligence found that the navy of
the Revolutionary Guard, which is distinct from Iran's regular navy and
focuses on smaller and faster but still heavily armed vessels, had
received more responsibilities to protect the Persian Gulf. Then there's
[Iran's ballistic missile program]{.underline}, which the Missile Threat
Project at the [Center for Strategic and International Studies describes
as "the largest]{.underline} and [most diverse missile arsenal in the
Middle East]{.underline}." The threat from Iranian missile technology
extends beyond the country's borders, too: [Hezbollah is thought to have
an arsenal of 130,000 rockets.]{.underline} [If]{.underline} the [United
States]{.underline} [were to engage in a military conflict]{.underline}
[with Iran]{.underline}, [it would]{.underline} probably
[require]{.underline} significant [manpower that would otherwise be used
to check]{.underline} bigger powers such as [China or
Russia.]{.underline} The New York Times reported Monday that Trump's
acting defense secretary, [Patrick Shanahan, drew up plans to deploy
120,000 U.S. troops]{.underline} [to the region]{.underline} if Iran
attacks American forces or restarts its nuclear program; this was based
on a scenario that did not involve an invasion, which would require more
troops.

[The failure of states in the Middle East]{.underline} since the Arab
Spring [poses]{.underline} greater and more **[immediate
threats]{.underline}** to U.S. security. An imperfect but decent proxy
for the amount of state failure in the international system is [the
number of ongoing civil wars]{.underline}. This number [increased
steadily]{.underline} from the end of the World War II to the early
1990s, when it reached a remarkably high level following the collapse of
the Soviet Union. At that time almost three in ten countries with a
population greater than half a million was experiencing a civil conflict
that had killed at least 1,000 people. Total deaths were substantially
greater in a large majority of these---median total deaths for wars in
progress in 1994 were at least 30,000. Since the mid 1990s we see some
decline and a leveling out, despite the outbreak of several large-scale
conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Quite a few civil
wars, many of them long running, ended in the second half of the 1990s,
in Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, and sub-Saharan Africa (though
almost as many started in the late 90s in Africa). Since 9/11 and the
Arab Spring, however, **[new state failures have been concentrated in
the MENA region]{.underline}**, [with dramatic instances in Iraq, Syria,
Libya, and Yemen]{.underline}. Three of these were middle-income
countries not too long ago. Syria and Iraq had developed business
sectors. Iraq, Syria, and Libya had all attempted nuclear weapons
programs, with various degrees of competence. [Although civil wars are
not new to this region]{.underline} -- or to these states, excepting
Libya---**[the degree of state collapse]{.underline}** [is of a whole
new order in all of them.]{.underline} Further, [the prospects for **a
return of stable central control in Syria and Iraq**]{.underline} [do
not seem good. State collapse and failure in this region is]{.underline}
much more **[consequential for]{.underline}** U.S. economic and
**[security interests]{.underline}** than in sub-Saharan Africa because
[it raises the risk of **a spread of civil wars and state failures to
other states in the region**]{.underline} [that are important
for]{.underline} regional and **[international
stability]{.underline}**---[Lebanon, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain,
Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, and Pakistan]{.underline}. [Refugees put
direct]{.underline} [strains on neighboring]{.underline} [states'
**economies**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[political
balances]{.underline}**. [Regional conflict over the failed states
**increases militarization**]{.underline}, **[cross-border support for
insurgents]{.underline}** or opposition movements in regional
adversaries, [and risks of]{.underline} regional **[interstate military
conflicts]{.underline}** ([including]{.underline}, to give just one
example, [more war between **Israel and Hezbollah**]{.underline} in
Lebanon[). State failure encourages the **transnational jihadi
movement**]{.underline}, [gives it **recruits and
training**]{.underline}, [some of whom will return to plot attacks in
their home countries and perhaps in Western countries as
well]{.underline}. And [all this takes place in a region with states
that **have the capability**]{.underline} (before they suffer major
failure or collapse) **[to mount serious nuclear weapons
programs]{.underline}**, [or to **purchase** weapons]{.underline}. A
major driver of the spread of state failure in this region is the
stunning success of the transnational movement of violent jihadis. This
is a movement explicitly aimed at producing state failure of U.N. member
states whose rulers are seen as beholden to the U.S., Europe, and an
infidel-run international system. The popularity of the movement among
young Muslim men has the effect of rendering all states in the region
more brittle. [Any shock to the capabilities of a state's coercive
apparatus relative to potential armed challengers is much more likely to
develop into a civil war]{.underline}, because the [movement makes it
much more possible for would-be rebel groups to get past a threshold of
military viability]{.underline}. As long as this movement inspires a
high degree of passion and attracts funds from some wealthy state and
non-state supporters, the risks of continued state failure will be
significant in this important area. **[The U.S. does not have the
capabilities it needs to deal with failed states]{.underline}**, in the
sense of bringing them out of failure. But it is not clear that any
third party does. **[Political order has to be built by
locals.]{.underline}** There have been circumstances, such as in Germany
and Japan immediately after World War II, when U.S. support could make a
big difference for state building in the aftermath of state failure (of
a sort). But these circumstances appear to be unusual and do not obtain
in the post-colonial world and present international system. [U.S. state
building interventions have **failed**]{.underline}, for similar core
reasons, [in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan.]{.underline}
[Counterinsurgency by a foreign power is basically "**shuffling the deck
chairs**]{.underline}," unless the supported government is highly
capable -- and if it were, we would not need to intervene heavily in the
first place. The U.S. probably does have policy instruments that can
lower the risk of contagion of state failure, if skillfully applied. But
as I suggested in the last memo, [there is a moral hazard problem that
is very tricky]{.underline}. In many areas, **[the more we do, the less
the governments whose states we aim to shore up do.]{.underline}**
[Unstable, coup-prone regimes have an aversion to developing strong,
capability militaries, and would rather rely on foreign
strength.]{.underline} **[Further, the more we do, the more we play into
the hands of the transnational movement and help them to
recruit.]{.underline}**

In a May 24 letter, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo notified
congressional leaders of the emergency declaration, waiving
congressional review of the weapon sales. Mr. Pompeo said he took into
account "political, military, economic, human rights and arms control
considerations." The State Department on Monday disclosed more details
to Congress, including the nature of the arms sales. "[If Saudi Arabia
is able to develop an indigenous bomb-making capability as a result of
this deal]{.underline}, [it will undermine U.S. leverage to prevent them
from engaging in indiscriminate strikes of the kind it has carried out
in Yemen]{.underline}," said William D. Hartung, director of the Arms
and Security Project at the Center for International Policy, a think
tank. The authorization paperwork signed by Mr. Pompeo offers no
timeline for the shared operations to get underway, and Raytheon
representatives have said they are still negotiating over details with
the Saudi government, according to a congressional aide. [Aside
from]{.underline} potentially [providing the Saudis with more bombs to
use in Yemen airstrikes, the arrangement raised security
concerns]{.underline} among lawmakers, who were seeking assurances [that
the Saudis could prevent the American technology from falling into the
wrong hands.]{.underline} Both Republicans and Democrats also noted that
it called for creating manufacturing jobs in Saudi Arabia that might
otherwise have been located in the United States. And [they expressed
worry that the Saudis might eventually copy the technology and use it to
produce their own weapons, which they would be free to use in Yemen or
sell to whomever they chose]{.underline}.

President [Trump]{.underline} recently [declared an "emergency" to
bypass Congress]{.underline} [and expedite billions of dollars in **arms
sales to Saudi Arabia**]{.underline} and the United Arab Emirates. It's
the kind **of** [move]{.underline} that only **[entrenches the
US]{.underline}** further [**as a** key **enabler of** the **war in
Yemen**]{.underline}. Following years of unconditional support for the
Saudi- and Emirati-led coalition, our Congressional leaders must now
take bold, comprehensive action that will have an immediate and positive
impact for those most in need. [They must suspend the transfer of
weapons for the Yemen war in the]{.underline} upcoming [National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA).]{.underline} The US is fueling the world's
largest humanitarian crisis The Trump administration could not make its
priorities more clear: pick friends and sell them weapons, as many as
possible, no matter the consequences for people who will suffer the
fallout. The real [**emergency is** the millions of Yemenis]{.underline}
[who are]{.underline} still [suffering from hunger]{.underline} [and a
broken economy]{.underline}. Over four years of [war]{.underline} have
[left]{.underline} too many [families struggling to
survive]{.underline}. [Disease continues to spread rapidly]{.underline},
[with]{.underline} the world's [largest recorded cholera
outbreak]{.underline} devastating families throughout the country. Now
[the **conflict is at a critical juncture**]{.underline}**. [Peace
negotiations]{.underline} are as [fragile]{.underline}** as ever. Oxfam
and other humanitarian organizations are facing huge obstacles to
deliver life-saving aid that is desperately needed in hard-to-reach
communities. [Powerful states]{.underline} [must demand]{.underline} [a
political agreement]{.underline} [for the millions of Yemenis trapped in
the conflict.]{.underline} The kind of arms ban that will matter A
[bipartisan group of Senators]{.underline} has [introduced
legislation]{.underline} [to block]{.underline} President
[Trump's]{.underline} recently announced [arms sales]{.underline}, but
it faces a likely presidential veto. Even if it could overcome a veto,
it will not stop the billions of dollars worth of bombs, tanks, and
other military equipment that Congress approved in past years and which
are already scheduled for delivery. In short, while standing up to
President Trump's recently announced arms sales will call needed
attention to the issue here in the US, it won't convince anyone fighting
in Yemen to pursue peace with any greater urgency. [The most powerful
way for Congress]{.underline} **[to stand up for Yemen]{.underline}**
[is to]{.underline} simply [**suspend the transfer of weapons** to
Saudi]{.underline}- and Emirati-led [coalition]{.underline} countries in
the upcoming NDAA, a law that Congress passes each year to outline the
budget and expenditures of the US Department of Defense. To be precise,
the arms sale suspension in the NDAA should include the following
elements: It should be long enough to matter (ideally two years); It
should be unconditional and without any presidential waiver with respect
to aerial bombs, which have been consistently used in violation of the
law of war; If other weapons (other than aerial bombs) are conditioned,
they should be conditioned on progress toward a political settlement and
support for the economy and aid delivery; It should apply to all member
countries in the Saudi- and Emirati-led coalition; and It should apply
to all transfers of arms, even those already licensed. This approach
actually enjoys broad support. The Saudi Arabia Accountability and Yemen
Act, introduced by senior Democrats and Republicans in the Senate,
includes an arms transfer suspension with almost all of these elements
(it applies only to Saudi Arabia, not other members of the Saudi- and
Emirati-led coalition). Congress is poised to act---if our leaders are
focused and brave It's likely that majorities would vote for a strong
arms sale ban in both the House and Senate---but Congressional leaders
may not give them the chance. Instead, rather than take on the arms
industry and President Trump, they may try to include weaker arms
transfer language that will be easy for the Trump administration and the
parties fighting in Yemen to ignore. In the Senate, Foreign Relations
Chairman Jim Risch (R-ID) and Armed Services Committee Chairman Jim
Inhofe (R-NE) have indicated they oppose blocking the Trump
administration's arms sales and would prefer a softer touch to Yemen. In
the House, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-NY) and
Ranking Member Michael McCaul (R-TX) are working on Yemen-related
legislation that they may propose adding to the NDAA, but it remains to
be seen whether they will support strong action. The support of Rep.
Adam Smith (D-WA) will be critical for a strong suspension to move
forward. Ironically, the House's Democratic leaders, who [vocally
championed the Yemen War Powers
Resolution](https://adamsmith.house.gov/2018/9/hasc-ranking-member-adam-smith-rep-ro-khanna-cpc-co-chair-mark-pocan-0)
that President Trump vetoed this Spring, have not yet stated their
support for a strict approach to arms transfers. But it's worth
remembering that many of those same leaders only committed to the War
Powers Resolution following substantial public demand. [A]{.underline}n
unconditional [ban on bomb transfers]{.underline}---the kinds of
[weapons that are most likely to be put to use to destroy schools,
hospitals, and family homes]{.underline}---will only become law if House
and Senate leaders make it a top priority in the NDAA. But in full view
of the Trump administration's morally bankrupt Yemen policy---and
following [Democratic

[to right that

cannot demand anything less.

BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: [U.S. lawmakers]{.underline} [are
renewing]{.underline} their [efforts]{.underline} to pass a war powers
resolution through Congress in an attempt [to end American military
support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen]{.underline}. As the U.S.
government grapples with its entanglement in Yemen\'s civilwar, CNN\'s
Nima Elbagir has been following the trail of U.S. weaponry and the
devastation left in their wake. After CNN presented its findings, a U.S.
Defense official told CNN exclusively that an investigation into
violations of U.S. arms agreements by coalition partners is ongoing.
This is Nima\'s exclusive report, \"Made in America, Lost in Yemen.\"
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT
(voice-over):[Shells of millions of dollars-worth of abandoned American
armored vehicles litter the roads]{.underline}. [Welcome to **Yemen**
where]{.underline} [**weapons** made in American is
**sold**]{.underline}**, [stolen and abandoned and making its way into
the wrong hands]{.underline}**[.]{.underline} **UNIDENTIFIED TV
ANNOUCER:** M-ATV defense. (GUNFIRE) **ELBAGIR:** We\'re here to trail
of those weapons and the chaos they have left behind. Our journey starts
at the front lines where a cease-fire was recently assigned. Climbing up
a defensive berm for a better look, the Houthi position, we\'re told, is
only around 200 to 300 meters away. **UNIDENTIFIED MALE:** (SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE) **ELBAGIR:** That movement there on the horizon. Did
you hear that? Get down. (GUNFIRE) **ELBAGIR:** There. Another shot
that\'s coming from over there. They want to take us to the actual
position. They want to show us the cease-fire violations. (CROSSTALK)
**ELBAGIR:** (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (CROSSTALK) ELBAGIR (on
camera): So they\'re now firing on us. You can hear it. I can hear a
musa that\'s incoming. (GUNFIRE) **ELBAGIR:** It\'s getting heavier and
we\'re told we have to leave. Even as we are driving away, even now you
can hear that. It\'s getting much, much heavier. (SPEAKING FOREIGN
LANGUAGE) (voice-over): [The **influx of weaponry is prolonging the
conflict**.]{.underline} On our way back from the front line, we spot
what we\'ve come in search of. (on camera): It\'s absolutely incredible
**[driving past]{.underline}**, and [it\'s like a graveyard of American
military]{.underline} [hardware]{.underline}. And [this is not under the
control of coalition forces.]{.underline} [This is in the command of
militias]{.underline}. \[13:35:09\] (voice-over): Which is expressly
forbidden by the arms sales agreement with the U.S. [On the outside
of]{.underline} these [mine-resistant armored vehicles]{.underline},
[MRAPs, there are stickers proudly proclaiming them as property of a
militia allied to the coalition]{.underline}. [We zero in on the serial
numbers, tracing them back to U.S. manufacturer, Navistar, the largest
provider of armed vehicles for the U.S. Army.]{.underline}
**UNIDENTIFIED MALE:** (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) **ELBAGIR:** We\'re
told to stop filming. **UNIDENTIFIED MALE:** (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
**ELBAGIR:** But we\'re able to find another vehicle. This one even has
the export sticker, from Beaumont, Texas, to Abu Dhabi in the United
Emirates. (SHOUTING) **ELBAGIR:** As we arrive back in town, we pass yet
another militia-heldMRAP. Everywhere we look, it seems, it\'s made in
the USA. (SHOUTING)ELBAGIR: Yemen is split between warring factions,
U.S.-backed and Saudi-led in the country\'s south, Iranian-backed Houthi
militias in the north. We can\'t cross front lines to go north, but the
MRAPs have. Captured by Iran\'s allies, the Houthis. (SHOUTING)
**ELBAGIR:** To the backdrop of chants to \"death of America, this
U.S.MRAP was broadcast on a Houthi-backed channel with Mohammad Ali
Houthi(ph), the deputy leader, sitting behind the wheel. CNN was able to
obtain the serial number from one of the Houthi-held MRAPs and verified
that it was part of the \$2.5 billion 2014 U.S. sale to the UAE, a
coalition partner. So why does it matter? Because these very [**MRAPs**
and others like them have]{.underline} already, we\'re told, [**fallen
into** the hands of **Iranian intelligence**]{.underline}. [In
an]{.underline} audio [interview with a member of a secret Houthi
unit]{.underline} of the Preventative Security Force, [CNN was told some
U.S. military technology has already been transferred to
Iran]{.underline}. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation): [Iranian
intelligence are assessing U.S. technology very closely]{.underline}.
There isn\'t a single American weapon that they don\'t try to find out
its details, what it\'s made of,how it works. **ELBAGIR:** [Advanced
improvised explosive devices with Iranian components are now
mass-produced by Houthi forces]{.underline} on a scale only previously
achieved by ISIS. And [the U.S.\'s first line of defense against IEDs,
the MRAP, has been compromised]{.underline}. The Houthi leadership
denied to CNN the existence of the Preventative Security Force. CNN has
also reached out to Iran for comment but received no response.
Regardless, at the very least, [these high-profile captures of American
hardware make them safer and harder to fight.]{.underline} (EXPLOSION)
(CROSSTALK) **ELBAGIR:** Our next stop is the mountain city of Baz (ph),
where we\'re told an Iran-linked militia is in possession of American
weaponry. In these images obtained by CNN, you see the Abalabas militia,
founded by and funded by Abalabas (ph), on the U.S. terror list, proudly
patrolling the streets of Baz (ph) in U.S. MRAPs. If that wasn\'t
unsettling enough, Baz (ph), as we learned, is also a wash with
weaponry. **UNIDENTIFIED MALE:** (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
**ELBAGIR:** [Arms markets are illegal]{.underline} in Yemen, [but that
hasn\'t stopped them from operating]{.underline}. **UNIDENTIFIED MALE:**
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) **ELBAGIR:** Using undercover cameras, we
are able to film arms sellers hidden amid women\'s clothing shops. He
doesn\'t today, but we\'re told we can put in a special order for an
American assault rifle. [Sellers like these are driving a black market
for high-tech American weapons]{.underline}. And that\'s just the tip of
iceberg. **UNIDENTIFIED MALE:** (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) **ELBAGIR:**
CNN was told by coalition forces that a deadlier U.S. weapon system, the
TOW missile, was air dropped in 2015 by Saudi Arabia to Yemeni forces,
an air drop that was proudly proclaimed across Saudi-backed media
channels. Where were they used and by whom? We try to find out. (on
camera): Yes, can you hear me? **UNIDENTIFIED MALE:** (INAUDIBLE)
**ELBAGIR:** Yes. **UNIDENTIFIED MALE:** (INAUDIBLE) **ELBAGIR:** OK.
We\'ve been told we can\'t go ahead with the interviews we had
preplanned. This local government is under the head of the coalition and
they are completely blocking our contacts or any of our ability to do
any work. (voice-over): The intimidation continued throughout that day
and into the night. Ultimately, we\'re chased out of town. \[13:40:00\]
But [we still want to find out what happened to the TOWs. We ask the
U.S. Department of Defense whether they knew what happened to the U.S.
anti-tank missiles. They said that despite Saudi TV coverage, they
weren\'t even aware of the claim that the kingdom of Saudi Arabia used
TOW anti-tank missiles in Yemen]{.underline} in October 2015.After CNN
presented its findings to the DOD, it says it has now launched an
investigation. The Saudi-led coalition has not responded to calls for
comment but a senior UAE official denied to CNN that they were in
violation of the arms sales agreement, saying, \"The Giants Brigade are
part of Yemeni forces that fight the Houthis on the ground and are under
our direct supervision.\" The U.S. DOD statement to CNN added, \"They
did not authorize any transfer of MRAPs or any military hardware from
Saudi Arabia or the UAE to third parties.\" So far, we\'ve focused on
the weapons fueling the war here. (CROSSTALK) **ELBAGIR:** But the
seemingly endless conflict they sustain has also sparked a manmade
catastrophe. Just a short distance from the front lines, the human toll
comes into full view. (CROSSTALK) ELBAGIR (on camera): This is Bashai,
and she is so malnourished, she can\'t walk. Her mother has to carry her
everywhere. There are 200 cases of malnutrition, like Bashai, just in
this one village. (voice-over): The local clinic had to shut down, so
when word that the doctor is here gets around, parents come out into the
street to meet her. Lola is 14 months old but looks far smaller.
(CRYING) **ELBAGIR:** After the doctor finishes her checkup, her father
takes us deeper into the village to meet other families. (on camera):
This is Rehab. She\'s two years old and she is so severely malnourished
that her chest has begun to cave in. But incredibly, this is Rehab after
she started getting better. The doctors said they have been able to get
her to keep some of the nutrition in, and they\'re actually hopeful now.
(voice-over): That hope, though, depends on peace. And what we\'ve seen
here doesn\'t give much hope of a lasting one. [How easy it is to get
your hands on high-tech U.S. weapons]{.underline}. [How a swamp of
uneasy alliances has **led to sensitive U.S. weaponry** **ending up in
both Iranian and al Qaeda-linked hands**]{.underline}. How America\'s
allies are making Americans less safe. Wherever or with whomever the
weapons end up, the war goes on. And ultimately, it\'s the people here
who, as ever, bear the brunt. Nima Elbagir, CNN, Al-Bayda (ph) Province.
(END VIDEOTAPE) **KEILAR:** U.S. weapon manufacturer, Navistar, did not
respond to CNN\'s request for comment. These U.S. arms sales are legally
process and sanctioned by the U.S. government. And CNN\'s exclusive
report has now gotten the attention of American lawmakers. At least one
Senator now calling for the U.S. to end its involvement in the Yemen
civil war. We have Senator Chris Murphy, along with Nima Elbagir, who
had that exclusive report, joining us live, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
\[13:48:10\] KEILAR: A member of the Senate Armed Services Committee is
calling for an end to U.S. involvement in the war in Yemen. This push
from Senator Chris Murphy is coming on the heels of an exclusive CNN
report, \"U.S. Weapons Sold to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates
Following into the Hands of Militias Linked to Iran and alQaeda.\" The
head of the U.S. Central Command was asked about the situation ata
hearing today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) **GEN. JOSEPH VOTEL, COMMANDER, U.S.
ARMY CENTRAL COMMAND:** We have not authorized Saudi Arabia or the
Emirates to retransfer any of this equipment to other parties on the
ground in Yemen. I think we have to look more closely at the allegations
in this particular situation to find out what happened. As we\'ve seen
in Iraq in the past, where we saw our partners overrun, we have seen
American equipment provided to them, lost in the course of a fight, end
up in the hands of our adversaries out there. And so I think we have to
examine that better. (END VIDEO CLIP) **KEILAR:** Senator Chris Murphy
is with us from Capitol Hill. CNN\'sNima Elbagir is in London with more
on her exclusive reporting. Senator, when you heard this CNN that Nima
had on CNN, what did you think? SEN. CHRIS MURPHY, (D), CONNECTICUT:
It\'s infuriating but not surprising. [There\'s a long history of the
United States sending very complicated, very lethal weapons into chaotic
war zones and those weapons ending up in the hands of our
enemies]{.underline}. Just recently, a few years ago, when we were
trying to train a whole bunch of so-called moderate rebels inside Syria,
many of the weapons we gave them ended up in the hands of those they
were supposed to be fight, groups connected to ISIS. This is predictable
and it\'s why many of us have been advocating for years for the United
States to get out of the civil war inside Yemen. [Our support for the
Saudis has been allowing them to intentionally kill civilians. And now
we find out fairly definitively that the weapons we have been giving the
Saudis are ending up in very conservative, very radical Sunni militias
that may end up using those weapons against the United States and our
allies]{.underline}. \[13:50:21\] KEILAR: Nima, you\'ve been, with this
reporting, in a unique position of knowing more than the U.S. government
does about where its weapons are ending up. What did you think about how
Capitol Hill is responding to your report? ELBAGIR: To General Votel\'s
point where he describes weapons being given to allies ending up in a
conflict situation in the hands of enemies, that\'s not what happened
here. These were weapons that were knowingly transferred from the United
Arab Emirates, that they admit to knowingly transferring to groups under
the coalition\'s aegis. Saudi Arabia publicly announce it had on
Saudi-backed media channels in addition to what we heard from coalition
sources. [They publicly announced that they were air dropping \-- which
is incredibly irresponsible. That\'s not a mechanism that you have a lot
of control over. They were air dropping antitank missiles with a
three-kilometer radius to a military front that includes an al
Qaeda-linked group.]{.underline} Where this seems to be breaking down is
that the United Arab Emirates, as they see it, believe that they have
the right to transfer this weaponry, even though the United States has
been pretty categoric that they do not \-- Brianna? **KEILAR:** Senator,
what do you say to that? What can Congress do? That\'s on outstanding
point that Nima makes. This isn\'t as General Votel describes it. [This
is knowingly being transferred in violation of these armed sales
agreements.]{.underline} **MURPHY:** We have raised these concerns with
the administration before. We have known for a long time that the Saudis
and UAE have created coalitions with very dangerous militias on the
ground inside Yemen. This is not news to the administration. Many of us
are worried about those groups that are inside the Saudi-led coalition.
But the Saudis also have been violating the rules of conflicts for years
now. When they use our bombs, they\'re not supposed to intentionally
drop them on civilians, and yet we have all sort of good reporting from
inside Yemen to show they\'ve been using U.S.-made bombs, U.S.-made
targeting systems, U.S. refueling planes to intentionally attack
civilian targets. And so it is also not as if our military didn\'t have
notice that the Saudis have in the past violated the conditions of our
alliance, so this should not be surprising to them given that history.
**KEILAR:** How do you deal with this, Senator, when we\'ve seen the
administration, the president in particular, rhetorically and in very
real ways, be soft on Saudi Arabia, for instance. What is \-- what can
be done aside from the administration where we\'re seeing this reticence
to be tough on the Saudis? **MURPHY:** Congress can pull the United
States out of this civil war. And in a few weeks, we will offer a
resolution on the floor of the Senate to do that, which will likely get
the majority of Senators voting in favor of it, Democrats and
Republicans. The House will take up that resolution. It will have a
majority of the House as well. The president may still veto that
resolution, but that doesn\'t mean that Congress shouldn\'t exercise our
responsibility to be a co-equal branch with the president in setting
foreign policy. As the reporting shows, the danger of staying in this
civil war is not just that [more military hardware will be transferred
to dangerous militias]{.underline}, it\'s that we will continue to be
part of a war that is creating a humanitarian catastrophe that\'s
already resulted in 85,000 little kids dying of starvation or disease.
Congress has got to take a vote to pull us out of this war. KEILAR:
Nima, your report was \-- it took us right to that point that the
Senator is talking about, to see these children who \-- they look\--
they look younger than they are because they\'re so malnourished, and it
is heartbreaking in the story you tell. What needs to be done to stem
this humanitarian crisis? **ELBAGIR:** Well, everyone we\'ve spoken to
on the ground is clear on one point, they need a real cease-fire. [And
the problem, is **when you have so many parties to the conflict
empowered by this easy access to weaponry**, **it\'s very difficult to
police a cease-fire**]{.underline}. And that is what needs to happen.
The parties to the conflict, even on a higher-level, I.E., the
coalition, they need to deliver on their promises to get aid to some of
these areas cut off by the fighting. And we saw very little evidence of
that on the ground \-- Brianna?

[With the administration]{.underline} firmly [behind]{.underline} its
[Saudi and Emirati allies]{.underline}, [Congress offers the best hope
to end]{.underline} [the]{.underline} American role in a
[war]{.underline} that has triggered one of the world's worst
humanitarian crises. In early April, the House voted to cease military
support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, finally approving a bill
to restrain presidential war powers that has taken years to pass both
chambers of Congress. On 16 April, Trump vetoed the bill. Two weeks
later, the bill's supporters in the Senate tried to override the veto
but fell short, 53-45. (It takes two-thirds of the Senate, or 67 votes,
to override a presidential veto.) But the measure was still a turning
point because it focused attention on the extent and unpopularity of
military support for Saudi Arabia and its allies. As the political
jockeying unfolded in Washington, the [United Nations Development
Programme]{.underline} [issued a report underscoring the extent of the
humanitarian disaster being fueled by US weapons and logistical
support]{.underline}. The report warned that [the death toll in Yemen
could rise to 233,000]{.underline} by the end of 2019 -- [far higher
than previous estimates.]{.underline} (The projection includes an
estimate of 102,000 deaths from combat and 131,000 indirect deaths due
to the lack of food, health crises like a cholera epidemic and damage to
Yemen's infrastructure.) "The current conflict in [Yemen is one of the
greatest preventable disasters]{.underline} facing humanity," the report
said, adding that [the conflict has turned into a "war on
children]{.underline}", [with a Yemeni child dying every 12
minutes.]{.underline} The report estimated that 140,000 of those killed
by the end of 2019 would be children under the age of five. Despite a
majority of Congress voting to end support, [American assistance to the
Saudi-led war persists, thanks to Trump's veto]{.underline}. In their
latest effort to stop the weapons sales, [congressional
critics]{.underline} of the war [will]{.underline} likely [need to
secure a veto-proof majority]{.underline}. It is a matter of moral and
political urgency.

their way into the **hands of Iranian-backed rebels** battling the
coalition for control of the country, **exposing** some of America\'s
**sensitive military technology** to Tehran and potentially endangering
the lives of US troops in other conflict zones.]{.underline} Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, its main partner in the war, [have

actors, and influence the complex political landscape]{.underline},
according to local commanders on the ground and analysts who spoke to
CNN. By handing off this military equipment to third parties, [the
Saudi-led coalition]{.underline} [is breaking the terms of its arms
sales with the US, according to the Department of Defense.]{.underline}
After CNN presented its findings, a US defense official confirmed there
was an ongoing investigation into the issue. [The revelations raise
fresh questions about whether the US has lost control over a key ally
presiding over one of the most horrific wars of the past decade, and
whether Saudi Arabia is responsible enough to be allowed to continue
buying the sophisticated arms and fighting hardware.]{.underline}
[Previous CNN investigations established that US-made weapons were used
in a series of deadly Saudi coalition attacks that killed dozens of
civilians, many of them children.]{.underline} The developments also
come as Congress, outraged with Riyadh over the murder of journalist
Jamal Khashoggi last year, considers whether to force an end to the
Trump administration\'s support for the Saudi coalition, which relies on
American weapons to conduct its war. In 2015, Riyadh launched a
coalition to oust Iranian-supported Houthi rebels from the country\'s
capital and reinstate the internationally recognized government of
President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi. The war split the country in two, and
with it came the weapons \-- not just guns, but anti-tank missiles,
armored vehicles, heat-seeking lasers and artillery \-- all flooding
into an unruly and complex state. Since then, some of America\'s
\"beautiful [military equipment]{.underline},\" as US President Donald
Trump once called it, has been [passed on, sold, stolen or abandoned in
Yemen\'s state of chaos]{.underline}, [where murky alliances and
fractured politics mean little hope for any system of accountability or
tracking.]{.underline} Some [terror **groups have gained** from the
influx of US arms]{.underline}, [**with the barrier of entry** to
advanced weaponry **now lowered** by the laws of supply and
demand]{.underline}. Militia leaders have had ample opportunity to
obtain military hardware in exchange for the manpower to fight the
Houthi militias. Arms dealers have flourished, with traders offering to
buy or sell anything, from a US-manufactured rifle to a tank, to the
highest bidder. And Iran\'s proxies have captured American weapons they
can exploit for vulnerabilities or reverse-engineer for native
production. In the narrow, ramshackle streets of Taiz\'s historic
district, weapons shops lie tucked between women\'s clothing stores.
Arms markets are illegal in Yemen, but that doesn\'t stop them operating
openly in this large, mountainous city in the country\'s southwest. To
one side hang veils, abayas and colorful dresses for sale; to the other
are pistols, hand grenades, and US assault rifles available on special
order. In one arms market, sweets were displayed among the ammunition.
\"Do you have American guns here?\" CNN asked. \"The American guns are
expensive and sought after,\" the weapons trader replied, in an exchange
captured by undercover CNN cameras. In another of the city\'s markets, a
very young-looking boy handled weapons like an expert. Men joked and
chewed khat, a commonly used drug, and the atmosphere was casual. But
these shops don\'t just take individual orders, they can supply militias
\-- and it\'s this not-so-hidden black market that in part is driving
the demand for hi-tech American weapons and perpetuating the cycle of
violence in Yemen. Once the intellectual heart of the country, [Taiz is
now a tinder box that set off a war within a war last year, when the
various militias backed by the Saudi-led coalition turned their guns on
each other. Amid the chaos of the broader war**, al Qaeda** in the
Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) made its way to the frontlines in Taiz in 2015,
forging **advantageous alliances** with the **pro-Saudi militias** they
fought alongside. One of those militias linked to AQAP, the Abu Abbas
brigade, now possesses US-made Oshkosh armored vehicles,]{.underline}
paraded in a 2015 show of force through the city. Abu Abbas, the
founder, was declared a terrorist by the US in 2017, but the group still
enjoys support from the Saudi coalition and was absorbed into the
coalition-supported 35th Brigade of the Yemeni army. "Oshkosh Defense
strictly follows all US laws and regulations relating to export
control,\" the firm told CNN. An Oshkosh armored vehicle rolls down a
street in Taiz in 2015. And there are deadlier forms of weaponry that
have made their way into the city. In October 2015, military forces
loyal to the government boasted on Saudi- and UAE-backed media that the
Saudis had airdropped American-made TOW anti-tank missiles on the same
frontline where AQAP had been known to operate at the time. Local
officials confirmed that the airdrop happened, but CNN\'s attempts to
conduct further interviews were blocked and the team was intimidated by
the local government. A local activist joked that the weapons had
probably been sold on. Graveyard of US military hardware At a graveyard
of discarded US-made military hardware near the flashpoint port city of
Hodeidah, it becomes clear that the Alwiyat al Amalqa \-- the Giants
Brigade, a predominantly Salafi, or ultra-conservative Sunni, militia
\-- is a favored faction. Nearly half a dozen Mine-Resistant Ambush
Protected (MRAP) vehicles sit side by side, most bearing stickers with
the insignia of the Giants Brigade. One even has the export label on it
showing it was sent from Beaumont, Texas to Abu Dhabi, in the UAE,
before ending up in the hands of the militia. The serial number of
another MRAP reveals it was manufactured by Navistar, the largest
provider of armored vehicles for the US military. An MRAP made by
Navistar and in the hands of the Giants Brigade. The armored all-terrain
vehicles are built to withstand ballistic arms fire, mine blasts and
improvised explosive devices (IEDs). "It's the vehicle that every crew
wants when they're out in the field," Navistar's website says. The firm
declined to comment on this report. Recipients of US weaponry are
legally obligated to adhere to end-use requirements which prohibit the
transferring of any equipment to third parties without prior
authorization from the US government. That authorization was never
obtained. The Saudi coalition did not respond to multiple requests for
comment. A senior UAE official denied "in no uncertain terms that we are
in violation of end-user agreements in any manner." The Giants Brigade
is a "part of Yemeni forces," the official told CNN, adding that the
group was under the direct supervision of the UAE and, therefore, the
equipment was in the "collective possession" of the coalition. The US
Department of Defense, when asked specifically about the Giants
Brigades, said it had not given Saudi Arabia or the UAE permission to
hand over US weaponry to other factions on the ground. \"The United
States has not authorized the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia or the United Arab
Emirates to re-transfer any equipment to parties inside Yemen,\"
Pentagon spokesman Johnny Michael told CNN. \"The US government cannot
comment on any pending investigations of claims of end-use violations of
defense articles and services transferred to our allies and partners.\"
Iran is 'assessing US military technology closely' [Because a majority
of American troop deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq are caused by IEDs, it
is critical that knowledge of MRAP vulnerabilities does not fall into
enemy hands.]{.underline} But it\'s already too late. In September 2017,
a Houthi-run TV channel broadcast images of Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, the
de facto rebel leader, proudly sitting behind the wheel of a captured
US-made MRAP in the capital Sanaa, as a crowd chanted \"death to
America\" in the background. CNN obtained an image showing the serial
numbers of a second American MRAP in the hands of another senior Houthi
official last year in Hodeidah. The photo was first published by Yemeni
journalist Hussain al Bukhaiti, the official's brother. The vehicle was
part of a \$2.5 billion sale to the UAE in 2014. The sale document, seen
by CNN, certifies that \"a determination has been made that the
recipient country can provide the same degree of protection for the
sensitive technology\" as the United States. MRAPs like these, captured
on the battlefield, have been probed by Iranian intelligence, according
to a member of a secret Houthi unit backed by Iran known as the
Preventative Security Force. The unit oversees the transfer of military
technology to and from Tehran. [The member of the force]{.underline},
speaking to CNN anonymously out of fear for his safety, [revealed that
Iranian and Hezbollah advisers have already gotten their hands on the
armored vehicles and other US military hardware.]{.underline} \"Iranian
intelligence are assessing US military technology very closely,\" the
source said in an audio interview done from Sanaa. \"Listen, there
isn\'t a single American weapon that they don\'t try to find out its
details, what it\'s made of, how it works.\" A barcoded serial plate The
serial numbers of one MRAP captured by Houthi forces trace the vehicle
back to a \$2.5 billion US arms sale to the UAE in 2014. IEDs are now
mass-produced in Yemen by Houthi forces on a scale only previously
achieved by ISIS, according to a report published by Conflict Armament
Research. The group tracks weapons and their supply chains in conflict
zones, and has found IEDs containing Iranian components in Yemen. Hizam
Al Assad, a member of the Houthi Political Council, confirmed to CNN
that the MRAPs were still in Houthi hands but denied the existence of
the Preventative Security Force. Iran has not responded to a CNN request
for comment. Human cost of conflict [The flood of US weaponry is fueling
a conflict that has killed tens of thousands \-- among them children on
school buses and families fleeing violence \-- and pushed millions more

Stopping the Yemen War The ongoing war in Yemen is an extension of the
security scenario in which Saudi Arabia needs to contain an Iranian
threat. If an alternative strategy were conceivable, [Saudi Arabia could
free up public funds for other purposes and avoid the war\'s collateral
damage]{.underline}, [horrific suffering and destruction]{.underline}.
Although the issues of the conflict seem intractable, during my recent
talks in Riyadh I learned of a [parallel Saudi policy, building working
relationships with all parties to the conflict for alleviating suffering
through humanitarian
relief]{.underline}.[**34**](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.mutex.gmu.edu/doi/10.1111/mepo.12367#mepo12367-note-0034_34)
It is a two‐pronged strategy: waging war against the Houthis while
building a working relationship with them to alleviate suffering.
Because the war has failed to produce the intended results, an
alternative strategy of building working relationships holds more
promise. There are several sound reasons, in addition to cutting
expenses and putting an end to human suffering, for building on these
relationships to broker a political solution: The Houthis would need to
form part of any conceivable coalition in Yemen if it is to be
sustainable. Iranian influence --- by way of what the Saudis during my
recent talks denoted the *Hezbollah Model* --- is not the cause of the
conflict. To the contrary, [it is the conflict that enables Iran to
establish a presence]{.underline}. In the Saudi view, the Hezbollah
Model denotes Iran\'s use of militias to undermine negotiated power
sharing, as they do in Lebanon. [Conflict enables the Hezbollah
Model.]{.underline} [Brokering a political deal with the Houthis
would]{.underline}, in other words, both [stop the war and put an end to
Iranian
influence]{.underline}.[35](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.mutex.gmu.edu/doi/10.1111/mepo.12367#mepo12367-note-0035_35)
(In fact, Hezbollah itself is the direct unintended consequence of a
far‐reaching Israeli miscalculation, the invasion of Lebanon in 1982
that had the effect of enabling Iran to establish its presence by proxy
in the window of opportunity Israel created. Actually, the scheming of
one man, Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, forcing the hand of a wiser
government majority against him, led to the ill‐advised
invasion.[36](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.mutex.gmu.edu/doi/10.1111/mepo.12367#mepo12367-note-0036_36))
The Hezbollah Model is, for all practical purposes, operated by the
Al‐Quds Brigade, the branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards for
foreign operations. This represents one among several competing
political factions in
Iran.[37](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.mutex.gmu.edu/doi/10.1111/mepo.12367#mepo12367-note-0037_37)
Therefore, Saudi Arabia could also contain the Hezbollah Model in Yemen
by building alliances with other Iranian factions, such as Foreign
Minister Javad Zarif. [Without war, Al‐Qaeda]{.underline}, which in the
early 2000s posed such a terrorist threat in Saudi Arabia from its haven
in Yemen, [would lose its current political platform]{.underline}: [its
hybrid role of terrorists‐turned‐semi‐co‐combatants against the Houthis,
legitimizing themselves there]{.underline}, [as they try to do in Syria,
by a popular‐front strategy of seeming to be absorbed into a broad
political movement]{.underline}. Finally, the sooner the war in Yemen is
stopped, the sooner Saudi Arabia can halt the dangerous disintegration
of its "soft underbelly" into chaos. With a population comparable to
that of Saudi Arabia, [Yemen\'s turning into a "new Somalia" would pose
an almost unimaginable security threat]{.underline}. The war in Yemen
will effectively block the necessary enabling external environment. One
casualty is the investment climate. To overcome this obstacle, bold
moves are imperative.

#### Terrorism causes extinction- it ensures nuclear retaliation

**Ayson 10** - Professor of Strategic Studies and Director of the Centre
for Strategic Studies: New Zealand at the Victoria University of
Wellington (Robert, July. "After a Terrorist Nuclear Attack: Envisaging
Catalytic Effects." Studies in Conflict & Terrorism, Vol. 33, Issue 7.
InformaWorld.)

But these two nuclear worlds---a non-state actor nuclear attack and a
catastrophic interstate nuclear exchange---are not necessarily
separable. It is just possible that [some sort of terrorist
attack]{.underline}, and especially an act of nuclear terrorism, [could
precipitate a chain of events leading to a massive exchange of nuclear
weapons between two or more]{.underline} of the [states]{.underline}
that possess them. In this context, today's and tomorrow's terrorist
groups might assume the place allotted during the early Cold War years
to new state possessors of small nuclear arsenals who were seen as
[raising the risks of a **catalytic nuclear war** between the
superpowers started by third parties]{.underline}. These risks were
considered in the late 1950s and early 1960s as concerns grew about
nuclear proliferation, the so-called n+1 problem. It may require a
considerable amount of imagination to depict an especially plausible
situation where an act of nuclear terrorism could lead to such a massive
inter-state nuclear war. For example, in the event of a terrorist
nuclear attack on the United States, it might well be wondered just how
Russia and/or China could plausibly be brought into the picture, not
least because they seem unlikely to be fingered as the most obvious
state sponsors or encouragers of terrorist groups. They would seem far
too responsible to be involved in supporting that sort of terrorist
behavior that could just as easily threaten them as well. Some
possibilities, however remote, do suggest themselves. For example, how
might the United States react if it was thought or discovered that the
fissile material used in the act of nuclear terrorism had come from
Russian stocks,40 and if for some reason Moscow denied any
responsibility for nuclear laxity? The correct attribution of that
nuclear material to a particular country might not be a case of science
fiction given the observation by Michael May et al. that while the
debris resulting from a nuclear explosion would be "spread over a wide
area in tiny fragments, its radioactivity makes it detectable,
identifiable and collectable, and a wealth of information can be
obtained from its analysis: the efficiency of the explosion, the
materials used and, most important ... some indication of where the
nuclear material came from."41 Alternatively, if the act of nuclear
terrorism came as a complete surprise, and American officials refused to
believe that a terrorist group was fully responsible (or responsible at
all) suspicion would shift immediately to state possessors. Ruling out
Western ally countries like the United Kingdom and France, and probably
Israel and India as well, authorities in Washington would be left with a
very short list consisting of North Korea, perhaps Iran if its program
continues, and possibly Pakistan. But [at what stage would Russia and
China be]{.underline} definitely [ruled out]{.underline} in this high
stakes game of nuclear Cluedo? In particular[, if the act]{.underline}
of nuclear terrorism [occurred against a backdrop of existing
tension]{.underline} in Washington's relations [with Russia and/or
China]{.underline}, and at a time when threats had already been traded
between these major powers, [would officials and political leaders not
be tempted to **assume the worst**]{.underline}? Of course, the chances
of this occurring would only seem to increase if the United States was
already involved in some sort of limited armed conflict with Russia
and/or China, or if they were confronting each other from a distance in
a proxy war, as unlikely as these developments may seem at the present
time. The reverse might well apply too: should a nuclear terrorist
attack occur in Russia or China during a period of heightened tension or
even limited conflict with the United States, could Moscow and Beijing
resist the pressures that might rise domestically to consider the United
States as a possible perpetrator or encourager of the attack?
[Washington's early response]{.underline} to a terrorist nuclear attack
on its own soil [might]{.underline} also [raise the possibility of an
unwanted]{.underline} (and nuclear aided) [confrontation]{.underline}
with Russia and/or China. For example, [in the noise and confusion
during the immediate aftermath]{.underline} of the terrorist nuclear
attack, [the U.S. president might be expected to place the
country's]{.underline} armed forces, including its [nuclear arsenal, on
a high]{.underline}er [stage of alert]{.underline}. In such a tense
environment, when careful planning runs up against the friction of
reality, [it is]{.underline} just [possible that Moscow and/or China
might mistakenly read this as a sign of U.S. intention]{.underline}s [to
use force]{.underline} (and possibly nuclear force) against them. In
that situation, the [temptations to preempt]{.underline} such actions
might [grow]{.underline}, although it must be admitted that any
preemption would probably still meet with a devastating response. As
part of its initial response to the act of nuclear terrorism (as
discussed earlier) Washington might decide to order a significant
conventional (or nuclear) retaliatory or disarming attack against the
leadership of the terrorist group and/or states seen to support that
group. Depending on the identity and especially the location of these
targets, Russia and/or China might interpret such action as being far
too close for their comfort, and potentially as an infringement on their
spheres of influence and even on their sovereignty. One far-fetched but
perhaps not impossible scenario might stem from a judgment in Washington
that some of the main aiders and abetters of the terrorist action
resided somewhere such as Chechnya, perhaps in connection with what
Allison claims is the "Chechen insurgents' ... long-standing interest in
all things nuclear."42 American pressure on that part of the world would
almost certainly raise alarms in Moscow that might require a degree of
advanced consultation from Washington that the latter found itself
unable or unwilling to provide. There is also the question of how other
nuclear-armed states respond to the act of nuclear terrorism on another
member of that special club. It could reasonably be expected that
following a nuclear terrorist attack on the United States, bothRussia
and China would extend immediate sympathy and support to Washington and
would work alongside the United States in the Security Council. But
there is just a chance, albeit a slim one, where the support of Russia
and/or China is less automatic in some cases than in others. For
example, what would happen if the United States wished to discuss its
right to retaliate against groups based in their territory? If, for some
reason, Washington found the responses of Russia and China deeply
underwhelming, (neither "for us or against us") might it also suspect
that they secretly were in cahoots with the group, increasing (again
perhaps ever so slightly) the chances of a major exchange. If the
terrorist group had some connections to groups in Russia and China, or
existed in areas of the world over which Russia and China held sway, and
if Washington felt that Moscow or Beijing were placing a curiously
modest level of pressure on them, what conclusions might it then draw
about their culpability.

### 2AC A2: No Smart Bomb

#### Raytheon builds high-tech bomb parts needed for the smart bomb

GMDI\]

WASHINGTON --- When the Trump administration declared an emergency last
month and fast-tracked the sale of more American arms to Saudi Arabia,
it did more than anger members of Congress who opposed the sale on
humanitarian grounds. It also raised concerns that the [Saudis could
gain access to technology that would let them produce their own versions
of American precision-guided bombs]{.underline} --- [weapons they have
used in strikes on civilians]{.underline} since they began fighting a
war in Yemen four years ago. [The]{.underline} emergency [authorization
allows Raytheon Company, a top American defense firm, to team with the
Saudis to build high-tech bomb parts in Saudi Arabia.]{.underline} That
provision, which has not been previously reported, is part of a broad
package of information the administration released this week to
Congress. [The move grants Raytheon]{.underline} and the Saudis sweeping
permission to begin assembling the control systems, guidance
[electronics]{.underline} and circuit cards that are [essential to the
company's Paveway smart bombs.]{.underline} The United States has
closely guarded such technology for national security reasons. Multiple
reports by human rights groups over the past four years have singled out
the weapons as being used in airstrikes on civilians. One attack, on a
Sana funeral home in October 2016, led the Obama administration to
suspend bomb sales to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. [The new
arrangement is part of a larger arms package]{.underline}, previously
blocked by Congress, [that includes 120,000 precision-guided
bombs]{.underline} that Raytheon is prepared to ship to the coalition.
These will add to the tens of thousands of bombs that Saudi Arabia and
the United Arab Emirates have already stockpiled, and some in Congress
fear the surplus would let the countries continue fighting in Yemen long
into the future. The move also includes support for Saudi F-15
warplanes, mortars, anti-tank missiles and .50-caliber rifles.

WASHINGTON --- [A]{.underline} controversial [arms deal for Arab
allies]{.underline} approved by the Trump administration [will allow
U.S. hi-tech bomb parts to be manufactured in Saudi Arabia]{.underline},
[giving Riyadh unprecedented access to a sensitive weapons
technology.]{.underline} The production arrangement is part of a larger
\$8.1 billion arms package for Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates
and Jordan announced two weeks ago. The Trump administration pressed
ahead with the sale without congressional approval, declaring an
\"emergency\" based on what it said was a heightened threat from Iran.
The deal came as a surprise to lawmakers, who were outraged that the
administration chose to bypass Congress. But most members of Congress
only learned days after the deal was announced May 24 that [it opens the
door for Saudi Arabia to host the production of electronic guidance and
control systems for Paveway precision-guided bombs,]{.underline}
congressional aides said. The New York Times first reported on the
co-production arrangement. Lawmakers are expected to grill a senior
State Department official --- R. Clarke Cooper, assistant secretary of
state for political-military affairs --- about the arms deal and the
bomb production plan at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing
Wednesday. The U.S. government tends to closely guard technology linked
to sophisticated weapons, and limits how much of that technology is
shared through co-production projects with other countries. Lawmakers
opposed to the deal said [the production scheme sent the wrong signal to
Saudi Arabia given its human rights record and its air war in Yemen,
raised]{.underline} security [concerns about sharing]{.underline}
so-[called \"smart bomb\" technology]{.underline} with Riyadh and
undercut one of President Donald Trump\'s arguments for selling weapons
to the Saudis --- to generate jobs in the United States. \"The concerns
over this sale are only one more reason showing the importance of
congressional review and why it is deeply disturbing that the Trump
administration is trying to circumvent the law and Congress to give the
Saudis not only American jobs but also American weapons technology,\"
Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the ranking Democrat on the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, said. The co-production plan had raised
eyebrows among some lawmakers more than a year ago when the
administration first tried to secure approval for tens of thousands of
precision-guided bombs to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, a
Democratic congressional aide told NBC News. Menendez held up the sale
of 120,000 precision-guided bombs for Saudi Arabia and the UAE last year
because of numerous accounts of civilian casualties from Saudi-led air
raids in Yemen. The senator has said the administration failed to
persuade him that selling more of the so-called \"smart\" bombs would
prevent more civilian deaths. [Human rights, U.N. investigators and aid
groups have accused Saudi Arabia and its allies of striking civilian
targets]{.underline}, including hospitals and schools, in indiscriminate
bombing raids in Yemen since Riyadh launched an armed intervention
against Houthi rebels in 2015. Congressional resistance to weapons sales
to Saudi Arabia only grew after the killing last year of Saudi writer
and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in
Istanbul. The Trump administration has defended the arms sale as a way
of ensuring Arab allies can defend themselves amid an allegedly
increased danger from Iran, and that Washington\'s credibility as a
military partner was at risk if it did not deliver spare parts and other
weapons promptly. U.S. officials privately have also said that
maintaining arms sales helps Washington exert a constructive influence
over the kingdom. A State Department official, who was not authorized to
speak on the record, said the production arrangement \"is not something
we would have licensed if we were not fully confident in both the Saudi
ability to protect the technology, as well as the positive impact on the
American defense industrial base.\" Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of
Connecticut, an outspoken critic of U.S. support for the Saudi-led
campaign in Yemen, condemned the production arrangement. \"To think that
we would co-produce [these bombs]{.underline} and in turn [contribute to
an arms race, regional instability, and civilian deaths]{.underline} is
unfathomable,\" Murphy said. \"[Congress needs to put a stop to the way
we do business with the Saudis]{.underline} and start acting like the
senior partner in this relationship rather than succumbing to whatever
the kingdom wants.\" \"[A secretive monarchy that commits atrocities in
Yemen]{.underline}, that murders dissidents and journalists and lies to
the world about it, [and]{.underline} that [treats women as property is
not one to which we should be giving some of our most sensitive military
technology]{.underline},\" Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said. [The Paveway
bombs can strike a target within 10 feet when fired from 40,000
feet]{.underline}, according to William Hartung, director of the Arms
and Security Project at the Washington-based Center for International
Policy, [and will almost certainly be used in the war in
Yemen]{.underline}. [\"The weapons are going to be put to use in a
civilian slaughter]{.underline},\" he said. The deal fits in with Saudi
Arabia\'s long term economic plan, Saudi Vision 2030, which calls for
the country to dramatically increase its domestic arms production.
\"They are trying to build up their own military manufacturing base,\"
Hartung said. [But the assembly of bomb parts in the kingdom raises
security and proliferation questions for the United States,]{.underline}
he added. [\"If they can master the production process, they could sell
it.\"]{.underline}

[The U.S. Senate is poised to debate a resolution that would force the

numerous senators have asserted that such a measure could help bring an
end to the conflict. [With the White House strongly opposed to this

transpires in the final legislative end game, it is worth examining both
the premise of congressional actions and the likely strategic
consequences. [Unfortunately, calls to "stop the Yemen war," though
morally satisfying, are fundamentally misguided. They ignore what is at
stake in the Yemen conflict]{.underline} and the true identity of the
warring parties[. A precipitous disengagement by the Saudi-led
coalition]{.underline} from militarily backing the UN-backed government
of Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi [in the Yemeni civil war would have calamitous
consequences for Yemen]{.underline}, the Middle East and the world at
large. The urgency to end the war reduces that conflict, and its
drivers, to a morality play, with the coalition of Arab states cast as
the bloodthirsty villain killing and starving Yemeni civilians. The
assumption seems to be that if the coalition's military operations are
brought to a halt, all will be well in Yemen. Everybody seems to have
forgotten that the conflict was triggered in late 2014 when the Houthis,
backed by Iran, toppled the Yemeni government and took over large areas
of the country, including strategic positions on the Red Sea. In seizing
power, the Houthis inflicted massive civilian casualties and crippling
damage to Yemen's rudimentary infrastructure. Presented with a strategic
threat at its doorstep, posed by an Iranian proxy and a humanitarian
crisis, Saudi Arabia, responding to a request by Yemen's legitimate
government and backed by U.N. Resolution 2216, militarily intervened in
the Yemen conflict seeking to restore Yemen's legitimate government. As
has been the case with the Afghan and Iraq wars, prosecuted by U.S.-led
coalitions[, the counterinsurgency campaign in Yemen has been a
difficult enterprise]{.underline}. Because the Houthis have been
fighting in a way that deliberately places civilians at risk, Yemen has
experienced dire security and humanitarian circumstances. [To curtail
the influx of Iranian arms, the Saudi-led coalition periodically has
restricted access to the port of Hodeidah, one of six main ports in
Yemen, and a vital transit area for both humanitarian supplies and
Iranian weapons transfers.]{.underline} The Houthis have exploited both
of these for their war efforts and to consolidate their tactical gains
on the ground, and so, abandoning the coalition efforts would leave
Yemen in the rebels' hands.

TEHRAN --- [Iranian officials lashed out at the United
States]{.underline} on Saturday [after the Trump Administration said it
would allow the sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, the United
Arab Emirates, and Jordan and deploy about 1,500 additional troops to
the Middle East to counter Iran. "[If they commit the slightest
stupidity, we will send these ships to the bottom of the sea along with
their crew and planes using two missiles or two new secret
weapons]{.underline}," Iranian Gen. Morteza Qorbani told the
semiofficial news agency Mizan on Saturday. Iran Foreign Minister
Mohammad Javad Zarif told the state news agency IRNA that the move to
send troops to the Middle East was "extremely dangerous and it threatens
international peace and security." The pending arms deal had drawn
criticism from U.S. lawmakers angry over civilian deaths from the
Saudi-led air campaign in Yemen. [Analysts said that officials in Tehran
were likely to see it as a further deterioration in relations between
the two countries]{.underline}, which have soured since President
Trump's decision last year to leave the Iran nuclear deal. The President
has argued that the nuclear deal failed to sufficiently curb Iran's
ability to develop nuclear weapons or halt its support for militias
throughout the Middle East that U.S. officials say destabilize the
region. Rather than exiting the deal, which is still supported by other
nations, Iran President Hassan Rouhani this month announced a series of
small steps to resume nuclear production restricted under the agreement.
The White House then announced additional sanctions on Iran's steel,
aluminum, iron, and copper sectors, accounting for 10 percent of the
country's exports. The U.S. troop increase is far less than the 20,000
forces that United States commanders in the region had sought. It
includes 600 troops whose deployments will be extended, along with 900
being newly sent to the Middle East. Under White House plans revised
after pressure from national security adviser John Bolton, if Iran were
to accelerate work on nuclear weapons, defense officials envision
sending as many as 120,000 troops to the Middle East. Mr. Trump --- who
has been keen to disengage from conflict zones in the Middle East ---
was seen as unlikely to boost troops by more than 100,000. A few days
ago, Mr. Trump himself sought to put the brakes on open confrontation,
telling the acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan that he did not
want to go to war with Iran. Meanwhile in Baghdad, Iraq's parliament
speaker said Saturday that Iraqi officials are ready to mediate between
the United States and Iran if it is asked to do so. Mohamad al-Halbousi
made the comments, carried by state TV, shortly after Mr. Zarif arrived
in Baghdad for a two-day visit. "We are ready to mediate to solve the
crisis between Washington and Tehran if we are asked for that," Mr.
al-Halbousi said. He added that there has been "no official request for
such mediation." Later in the day, Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi
hosted Mr. Zarif for iftar, the meal that breaks daylong fasting during
the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. A statement released by Mr.
Abdul-Mahdi's office said the two officials discussed "ways of making
the two countries and the region avoid the harms of sanctions and the
dangers of war." They also spoke about the importance of security and
stability in the Middle East and how to maintain the nuclear deal. Mr.
Abdul-Mahdi said last week that Iraq will send delegations to the United
States and Iran to help end tensions between the two countries, adding
that Baghdad is neutral in the conflict. [On May 19, a rocket was fired
into Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone]{.underline}, landing less
than a mile from the sprawling U.S. Embassy. There were no injuries and
no group claimed responsibility, but the rocket was believed to have
been fired from east Baghdad --- which is home to Iran-backed Shiite
militias.

**[[disadvantages]{.underline}]{.mark}** American's [[national security
by **constraining**]{.mark} **[U.S. freedom of
action]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [As the most powerful
country]{.underline} on the planet, [with the ability to project
power]{.underline} to every corner of the globe, [the
United]{.underline} [States has the ability to threaten]{.underline} or
protect [every other state in the international system]{.underline}.
This is a significant source of strategic leverage and maintaining
freedom of action has been an important objective of U.S. national
security policy.63 [[As nuclear weapons]{.mark}
[spread]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [[America's military freedom of
action will be constrained]{.underline}]{.mark}. The United States can
use, or credibly threaten to use, force against nonnuclear states.
**[[The threat]{.mark} of military action]{.underline}** against
nuclear-armed states **[[is much less credible]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
however, [[because]{.mark} [nuclear]{.mark}]{.underline}[-[armed states

threat of]{.mark} **nuclear [retaliation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
January 2012, for example, Iran threatened to close the Strait of
Hormuz, a narrow Persian Gulf waterway through which roughly 20% of the
world's oil flows, and the United States issued a counter-threat,
declaring that Washington would use force to reopen the Strait if
necessary. If Iran had had nuclear weapons, however, Washington's
threats would have been much less credible. Would a U.S. President
really be willing to risk nuclear war with Iran in order to keep the
Strait open? Maybe. But, maybe not. While the United States might not be
deterred in every contingency against a nuclear-armed state, it is clear
that, at a minimum, the spread of nuclear weapons greatly complicates
U.S. decisions to use force. Again, optimists might argue that this
effect demonstrates their argument, but it only partially demonstrates
part of it. It is indeed a reason why proliferation might dampen
conventional conflict, but it is also reason why, from Washington's
perspective, more would be worse, not better

### Prolif Escalates

#### Iranian proliferation demolishes US non-prolif credibility; causes global proliferation

**Bolton 14** (John. 12/5. John R. Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations, is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute. \"Iran\'s pursuit of the Islamic bomb invites copycats.\"
Global Issues in Context) 6/14/15 RK

While [the future of Iran\'s nuclear program has rightly been the focus
of the intense Vienna negotiations, there are other significant
implications extending well beyond Tehran]{.underline}. Because of
President Obama\'s many concessions, **[Iran has made significant
gains]{.underline}**, particularly enhanced international legitimacy for
both its regime and its extensive nuclear activities. Now that the
negotiating \"deadline\" has been extended until June 2015, **[we should
consider the broader global implications]{.underline}** of Mr. Obama\'s
Iran policy. [Other aspiring nuclear-weapons states have carefully
followed the negotiations,]{.underline} drawing conclusions and making
plans accordingly. Very shortly, the wider ripples of die talks will
manifest themselves in two ways. First, Iran\'s near neighbors,
including **[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**, **[Egypt]{.underline}**, and
**[Turkey, will]{.underline}** almost certainly **[accelerate their
nuclear activities,]{.underline}** following a clear path to producing
weapons. Second, **[North Korea]{.underline}**, left to its own devices
(and continuing progress on both weaponization and ballistic-missile
development) these past six years, clearly **[sees a weak negotiating
counterpart in Washington, and will try to achieve many of the same
advantages]{.underline}** Tehran is now harvesting. The Middle Eastern
conventional wisdom has long held that if Iran produced deliverable
nuclear weapons, other states would follow inexorably. As then-Secretary
of State Hillary Clinton said in 2009, \"[A nuclear-armed Iran with a
deliverable weapons system is going to spark an arms race in the Middle
East and the greater region .\"]{.underline} Saudi Arabia will move
first. Indeed, [the Saudis may already have \"options\" on existing
Pakistani warheads]{.underline}, meaning that Riyadh would not need to
build its own nuclear program, but could effectively become a nuclear
power overnight. [Egypt and Turkey]{.underline} would start farther
behind, but they [have already made initial efforts,]{.underline} such
as Cairo\'s 2013 nuclear deal with Moscow. Iran\'s path to weaponization
appears now to be merely a matter of its own timing, absent an Israeli
military strike like those undertaken previously against Iraq and Syria.
Accordingly, none of the potential proliferators have any incentive to
wait for Iran to actually test a nuclear device to prove its existence.
[These regional powers will almost certainly conclude that Iran will
weaponize]{.underline}, and that having their own deterrent capability
is the only appropriate response. Indeed, with Washington accepting
Iran\'s \"peaceful\" program, these and others could move very quickly.
They will definitely not rely solely on U.S. assurances. Given how
meaningless Mr. Obama\'s Iran assurances were, the other potential
proliferators will not bother with subtlety as they proceed. North Korea
obviously stands in a very different position, having itself already
detonated three nuclear devices. While the White House has (so far; at
least) not chased Pyongyang for a nuclear agreement as it has Tehran,
[the North\'s nuclear threat has nonetheless grown]{.underline}. Both
its ballistic-missile program and the critical miniaturization of
nuclear weapons into warheads mated with such missiles for long-range,
even worldwide delivery, have proceeded rapidly. Curtis Scaparrotti,
commander of U.S. forces in Korea, said in October; \"I believe [they
have the capability to miniaturize the device at this point and they
have the technology to potentially actually deliver what they say they
have.\"]{.underline} Pyongyang could readily conclude, based on Iran\'s
successes, that Mr. Obama\'s remaining two years provide the most
propitious period in which to make a nuclear deal with Washington.
Having already twice expelled International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
inspectors, most recently in 2009, the North can go a long way simply by
allowing IAEA renewed access to the known facilities at Yongbyong. Of
course, since everything important in North Korea\'s ongoing
weapons-related program in undoubtedly well concealed far from that
location, Pyongyang\'s risks could be manageable. Given the gullibility
of Mr. Obama\'s negotiators, the omens are good for a North Korean
initiative. There are additional negative consequences. Beyond Russia\'s
Egypt deal, Moscow signed a significant commercial agreement with Iran
in 2014 to build eight new nuclear reactors, in addition to the
already-functioning Bushehr facility. Additional sales throughout the
Middle East and beyond are tempting prospects. Moreover; [Russia has
also allowed]{.underline} (or encouraged) [its citizens to be employed
\"individually\" by would-be proliferators as nuclear and
ballistic-missile experts]{.underline}. **[This]{.underline}** ploy has
allowed Moscow to evade either responsibility or consequences, but
**[nonetheless forms a worldwide proliferation pattern.]{.underline}**
And while A.Q Khan\'s nuclear-enrichment business was brought to a
crashing halt in 2004, [other entrepreneurs could logically conclude
that demand for their skills will rise significantly in coming
years]{.underline}. Finally, much of the damage done by the Obama
administration cannot be easily repaired. **[Once a proliferator crosses
key thresholds, the work cannot be rolled back except through a
strategic decision to abandon the pursuit of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**. While this has happened before (such as South
Africa after apartheid), [it typically requires regime change for a new
government to have the courage and political space to reverse
course]{.underline}. Unfortunately, therefore, Mr. Obama\'s dangerous
nuclear legacy will inevitably be high on the agenda of repair work for
his successor.

The Middle East and North Africa ([MENA]{.underline}) region [is

[Western nations such as the United States and its allies are weary
of]{.underline} an Islamic I[ran that continually repeats anti-west
rhetoric]{.underline}. In the presence of a weapons state of Iran, the
risks of an empowered Iran provoke a set of reactions from western
states and key allies in the region. However, [the anxiety in the region
over the Iranian program goes beyond Israel']{.underline}s. Countries
such as **[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** and other gulf countries,
**[Turkey]{.underline}**, in addition to **[Jordan are]{.underline}**
also **[aware of the overwhelming implications of a nuclear weapons
state of Iran]{.underline}**. The answer to why a nuclear weapons state
of [Iran will produce negative implications in the region]{.underline}
is seen through the risks and explosive results of proliferation in the
region. **[Proliferation is the expected outcome if Iran decides to
declare a nuclear weapons arsenal.]{.underline}** Countries' regional
status and power, political pressure or the existence of conventional
threat in addition to the economic capacity determine proliferation.
[Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Turkey are case examples of nations who will
proliferate due to present evidence of these determinants instigated
by]{.underline} a nuclear weapons state of [Iran]{.underline}. In Saudi
Arabia, [the presence of a Shia crescent]{.underline} in the region
[jeopardizes]{.underline} its [regional status]{.underline}. Political
tension and conventional confrontations in Syria with Iran in addition
to its oil rich economy allow Saudi Arabia to purchase a nuclear arsenal
to deter a nuclearized Iran. In Israel, the case was different because
Israel is a country led by its national security, and it possesses
nuclear weapons as a preemptive preparation to deter its hostile
neighbors. [A]{.underline} [violent Iran that supports Hezbollah and
Hamas puts Israel in an unstable conventional confrontation with these
groups]{.underline}. Israel's strong economy and its ability to maintain
military superiority are all factors explaining why it decided to obtain
its undeclared nuclear weapons. Finally, [Turkey was a difficult state
to assess]{.underline}. [Due to its friendly diplomatic relationship
with powerful states !\", in the region,]{.underline} like Saudi Arabia
and Israel, and a friendly relationship with Iran, [it was not clear
whether a nuclearized Iran would result in proliferation in
Turkey]{.underline}. However, **[there is evidence to confirm that in
light of the conflict in Syria and the instability in Iraq, Turkey is at
risk and in need of securing its borders]{.underline}** and maintaining
its regional status from regressing. The implications of a nuclear
weapons zone in the Middle East produce a dangerous reality for the
region[. This is due to the implications of a multipolar region that
will result in an intense environmen]{.underline}t. One danger produced
by such a world is the access of non-state actors to these nuclear
weapons. **[The risks of nuclear terrorism are at the core of the
consequent instability in the region]{.underline}**. [Due to Iran's
support of non-state actors that pursue terrorist tactics]{.underline}
to advance their political aim, the risks to civilian life, the
**[proliferation of these nuclear weapons to more dangerous non-state
affiliated groups will gravely demolish human life]{.underline}** in the
region. The reality of this world is that the proliferation is fast and
the time needed to contain these risks will be short.

Let\'s start with the powder keg. [[The immediate cause of the fighting
in World War I was the **set of ethnic and religious conflicts in the
Balkans**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} In the second half of the 19th
century, economic development and modernization led to heightened
competition among the region\'s peoples. The drive for
self-determination set Croats, Serbs, Magyars, Kosovars, Bosniaks,
Macedonians, Bulgarians, Greeks and others at one another\'s throats.
The death toll mounted and the hatred grew as massacres and ethnic
cleansing spread \-- and the ability of the outside powers to control
the region\'s dynamics shrank as the imperial powers were themselves
undermined by rising social and nationalist tensions.

[[The Middle East today bears an ominous resemblance]{.mark} to the

Iran belong to clandestine special operations forces and other
government agencies who surreptitiously locate and destroy key targets
or shuttle key insiders out of the war-torn country of Iran. Weeks,
perhaps months later, ammunition stocks depleted, no more major targets
to hit, smoke and dust subside and an uneasy stasis emerges. More likely
than not, the leadership regime in Iran remains in place as a weakened
nation strives to put itself back together. And a nuclear program begins
anew. Earlier this month, Iran's leaders announced that they would
restart uranium processing unless other signers of the 2015 nuclear deal
made between them, the United States, China, France, Germany, Russia,
the United Kingdom and the European Union, could find ways to ease the
harsh sanctions imposed by the United States when it pulled out of the
deal last year. What followed was leaked reports of war plans being
drawn up that could include as many as 120,000 U.S. troops headed to the
region, a number similar in size to the 2003 Iraq invasion. What
followed also included leaders of both Iran and the United States
claiming they didn't want war, yet each preparing in many ways for
exactly that outcome. Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan followed
that up by saying about 900 additional troops were headed to the region,
on top of those manning Patriot batteries already shipped out. The
United States sent a carrier battle group and long-range bombers to the
region. Reports allege that the head of the Iranian proxy groups have
been ordered to prepare for a range of strikes against U.S. and allied
targets across the Middle East. Those involve some Shia groups in the
region, but not all, as some are aligned with Iran but others operated
based on their own, local needs. Could this all be political
saber-rattling? Or could provocations unsheathe that saber? As one
expert told Military Times, with thousands of troops in the region and
more headed that way, there is, "[the opportunity to miscalculate and
watch this spiral out of control is always there."]{.underline}

Europe, and Israel]{.underline}. [With ease and using a primitive
nuclear weapon]{.underline}, a "New Axis" of [those aggressive nations
could "black out" the Western world, **dismantle all electricity and
electronics, end water and food supply, and lead to millions of deaths
in America.**]{.underline} "[Nine of 10 Americans are dead from
starvation, disease, and societal collapse. **The United States of
America ceases to exist**]{.underline}," warned the report declassified
by recently decommissioned U.S. Commission to Assess the Threat to the
United States from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack. [The
report]{.underline}, written by EMP expert Peter Vincent Pry, [revealed
EMP war plans drawn up by Iran, Russia, China, North Korea, and even
ISIS.]{.underline} In "Nuclear EMP Attack Scenarios and Combined-Arms
Cyber Warfare," Pry said that [the Russians have called EMP a
"revolution in military affairs]{.underline}." He explained it this way
to the Washington Examiner: "[This new warfare uses cyber viruses,
hacking, physical attacks, non-nuclear EMP weapons, and a nuclear EMP
attack against electric grids and critical infrastructures. **It renders
modern armies, navies, and air forces obsolete**. It paves the way for
asymmetric warfare by small nations and terrorists]{.underline}." Pry
said that [the U.S. is an easy target because virtually everything,
military and civilian, relies on computers, and **even the Pentagon uses
the civilian Internet**]{.underline}. "Ours is the most technologically
advanced society, and therefore the most susceptible to attack," said
Pry. The commission, [the military]{.underline} and civilian groups
[have begun to take attacks on the U.S. electrical and Internet network
more seriously]{.underline}, and they have discovered that [those would
be far more effective against the United States than a
bomb]{.underline}. "Although it is very difficult to predict exactly
which electronic systems would be upset, damaged, or destroyed by an EMP
attack, [with certainty massive disruption and damage will be inflicted
on unprotected electronics within the EMP field and, because of
cascading failures, far beyond]{.underline}. EMP is analogous to carpet
bombing or an artillery barrage that causes massive random damage that
is specifically difficult to predict, but reliably catastrophic in its
macro-effects," he said. Pry, in calling for greater Pentagon and
Homeland Security attention to the issue, compared the potential for an
attack to Pearl Harbor. He also presented [an "EMP World War" scenario
where **all the countries with EMP warfare plans join in a "New Axis" to
attack the U.S., Europe, and Israel**]{.underline}. Pry even suggested
that [a nuclear explosion in the atmosphere above Omaha]{.underline},
Neb., [could black out Canada, the U.S., and Mexico. He predicted that
an attack would lead to "**damage too broad and too deep to
repair**]{.underline}, requiring years, if the U.S. could survive for
years." Without making relatively inexpensive fixes to the electric grid
and military bases to protect against an EMP attack, Pry said that the
end could come fast. "There is no coming back," said his report, adding:
"[Everything is in blackout and nothing works. The EMP sparks widespread
fires, explosions]{.underline}, all kinds of [industrial
accidents]{.underline}. [Firestorms rage in cities and forests. Toxic
clouds pollute the air and chemical spills poison already polluted lakes
and rivers. In seven days, the **over 100 nuclear power reactors run out
of emergency power and go Fukushima, spreading radioactive plumes**
over]{.underline} the most populous half of [the United
States]{.underline}. There is [not even any drinking water and
the]{.underline} national [food supply in regional warehouses begins to
spoil in three days]{.underline}. There was only enough food to feed 320
million people for 30 days anyway."

## Strait of Hormuz 

### 2AC- Econ

#### **Even is strait doesn't close conflict triggers impact- market perception** 

**Karam 12** Raymond E. Karam, Program Associate and the Washington,
D.C. Representative of the EastWest Institute, "The Strait of Hormuz:
What\'s at Stake", East West Institute, 1-10,
http://www.eastwest.ngo/idea/strait-hormuz-whats-stake

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, daily oil flow
through the strait amounted to almost 17 million barrels in 2011, up
from between 15.5-16.0 million in 2009--2010, that constituted roughly
35 percent of all seaborne traded oil. Roughly [90 percent of all Gulf
oil]{.underline}, or 20 percent of oil traded worldwide, [leaves the
region on tankers]{.underline} that must pass [through this narrow
waterway, as land **[pipelines do not provide sufficient
alternative]{.mark}** export [routes]{.mark}]{.underline}.∂ A Mounting
Standoff∂ Tensions between Iran and the United States fueled fears of
supply disruptions as Iran threatened to take action if the U.S. Navy
moved an aircraft carrier, the USS John C. Stennis, back into the Gulf.
In most analysts' assessments, the jump in oil prices was likely to
continue as long as Tehran continued its threats to use force against
U.S. warships patrolling the strategically vital Strait of Hormuz at the
mouth of the Gulf.∂ The tough rhetoric exchanged between Tehran and
Washington over the waterway comes in the wake of the latest wave of
sanctions that Washington says are designed to discourage the Iranian
state from developing nuclear weapons. Late last month, U.S. President
Barack Obama signed legislation imposing sanctions against Iran's
central bank intended to make it more difficult for the country to sell
its oil. The Iranian escalation is seen in Washington as evidence that
tighter sanctions are finally beginning to bite.∂ Tougher measures
against Tehran are also expected to be announced at the end of this
month by EU foreign ministers who have signaled that they will agree to
impose an embargo on Iranian oil imports. Iranian officials have made
clear they would view an oil embargo as an act of "economic war," and
that they could respond by closing the strait.∂ Exacerbating these
tensions are internal factors in the United States and Iran, where
political groups are positioning themselves in anticipation of crucial
parliamentary elections in Iran in March and the U.S. presidential
elections in November.∂ The Iranians are pledging not to back down
militarily. Iran's latest military exercise is seen as a clear signal
that it has a deterrent capacity, making it capable of inflicting
unacceptable harm on anyone thinking of attacking it. Moreover,
following the Iranian navy's exercises, the naval commander for the
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), Rear Admiral Ali Fadavi,
announced that the IRGC's own drills will take place in February. On the
same day, the Israeli military said it was preparing for joint exercises
with the United States to rehearse missile defense and cooperation
between the forces. Theses maneuvers, which will involve thousands of
troops, have been planned for some time and were hailed by Israeli and
U.S. officials as their biggest ever joint drill. Hopefully, the massive
exercises will remain just that, but with three armies on the playing
board, one spark could be enough to ignite an all-out war.∂ The United
Kingdom has also joined the United States in pledging a tough response
to any Iranian threat. Philip Hammond, the British defense secretary,
said during a visit to Washington: \"Disruption to the flow of oil
through the strait of Hormuz would threaten regional and global economic
growth. Any attempt by Iran to close the strait would be illegal and
unsuccessful.\" Hammond followed on his warning by sending the Royal
Navy\'s newest and most advanced ship, the destroyer HMS Daring, to the
Gulf for its first mission. Meanwhile, there is speculation that Israel
might attack Iran\'s nuclear facilities, claiming that it is a front for
acquiring nuclear weapons, or at least a capacity to make them.∂ A Great
Power's Vulnerability ∂ Although the regional dominance of the U.S.
Fifth Fleet, not to mention the other military assets that Washington
could deploy from local bases, is not in question, Iran has invested
shrewdly in asymmetric warfare capabilities specifically designed to
counter U.S. technological superiority. To that end, it has emphasized
the procurement of numerous types of guided missiles, many of them
placed on light, highly mobile and relatively cheap platforms on land,
in the air and at sea.∂ Iran could also strike at U.S. economic
interests in the Gulf, such as oil facilities and tankers, and block
ships by laying mines, as it did during its war with Iraq in the 1980s.
And, despite the damage that the Syrian uprising is doing to the
relationship between Iran and its other Middle Eastern allies, Tehran
could still call on Hezbollah and Hamas to inflict as much damage as
possible on its adversaries.∂ [The [Market's **Watchful Eye**]{.mark}
∂]{.underline} Extended closure of the Strait of Hormuz would remove
one-fifth of the world's oil from the market causing a supply shock of
the type not seen since OPEC's heyday. [[Even if]{.mark} the [strait
were not to]{.mark} physically [close]{.mark}, a]{.underline} military
[[conflict]{.mark} in the area [could **cause**]{.mark} **oil [prices to
skyrocket in anticipation]{.mark}** of a supply disruption, [and]{.mark}
prices would [remain high until]{.mark} markets are [assured]{.mark}
that]{.underline} free and [safe [passage has]{.mark} been [restored. A
sharp rise]{.mark} in oil prices [would prove **catastrophic** to the
world economy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Energy analysts say even a partial
blockage of the strait could raise the world price of oil by \$50 a
barrel or more within days, and that would quickly push the price of a
gallon of regular gasoline to well over \$4 a gallon in the United
States. [This would have **serious effects on the world economy**,
[and]{.mark} would **[surely send]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates economy back [into recession]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### Just [interrupting shipping]{.underline} links, even if Hormuz stays open

**Lacey 12** (Jim Lacey, Ph.D. in Military History from Leeds
University, retired from the Army Reserves in 2005, after 24 years of
service, 1-4-2012, \"Iran's Hormuz Threat\", National Review Online,
http://www.nationalreview.com/article/287076/irans-hormuz-threat-jim-lacey)

Even this, however, misses the point. [[To create massive global
economic dislocation]{.mark}, the [Iran]{.mark}ians [do not have to keep
the strait closed or **even close it at all**. **All they have to do is
make it difficult for ships to transit**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [On a
daily basis]{.underline} approximately [15
[supertankers]{.mark}]{.underline} make their way through the strait,
[[carry]{.underline}]{.mark}ing over 15 million barrels of oil --- [[a
sixth of]{.mark} the [world]{.mark}'s [supply. **Any**]{.mark} real
**[threat]{.mark}** to]{.underline} these [shipments [would see
insurance]{.mark} rates **[skyrocket]{.mark}**]{.underline}, assuming
that shipping companies, captains, and crews even wanted to risk the
trip.∂ Moreover, [[if]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}ians [did [try to close]{.mark} the strait,
[it is unlikely they]{.mark} would [limit]{.mark} themselves [to **just
that**]{.mark} action]{.underline}. Rather, [we could [expect Iran to
**sow mines**]{.mark}]{.underline} [throughout the]{.underline} Persian
[Gulf, particularly]{.underline} just [outside ports and
within]{.underline} the [shipping lanes]{.underline}. [[Saudi Arabia
would]{.underline}]{.mark} probably [[have to endure]{.mark} a barrage
of [hundreds of missiles]{.mark}]{.underline}, most of them [aimed at
oil-shipment chokepoints]{.underline}, such as the stabilization plant
at Abqaiq. These would be closely followed by as many air sorties as
Iran's 100-plus attack aircraft could launch before they were
overwhelmed by U.S. airpower. [[All]{.mark} of this [would be
**catastrophic to the global economy**]{.mark}, and]{.underline} [we
have not even considered what damage Iran's special forces]{.underline}
or its sponsored terrorist groups [might do]{.underline}. It is also
worth noting that most of Saudi Arabia's oil-rich areas are populated by
Shias, who may have some sympathy for their co-religionists in Iran.
Finally, we have not even considered the possibility that Iranian
conventional forces, taking advantage of our withdrawal from Iraq, might
move into Basra to interrupt Iraqi, and possibly Kuwaiti, oil
shipments.∂ So, [what happens if Iran does strike with its entire
arsenal of options?]{.underline} For one thing, [[oil **immediately
spikes to \$200 a barrel**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the price of gas
tops \$15 or \$20 a gallon. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark}, in turn, [will
[snuff out]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**[nascent]{.mark} global [economic
recovery]{.mark}**, and we can [count on]{.mark}]{.underline} a
**[[sharp recession]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [How fast]{.underline} and
decisively [U.S.]{.underline} and other world [leaders react will decide
the deepness and length of this recession]{.underline}. A rapid release
of the strategic petroleum reserves would soon bring down oil prices.
Moreover, the world has enough oil in strategic reserves to make up
expected losses from Iranian attacks for a little over a year. The
United States, therefore, has that long to both demolish Iranian
offensive capabilities and repair the damage. In short, if the world
acts decisively, an Iranian attack would cause a severe, but
short-lived, economic dislocation.

[A [closure of]{.mark} one of these]{.underline} two

either as a result of an accident or a security incident,
[[represents]{.mark} a [serious risk to **global oil prices**

[threats]{.mark} voiced [by Iran]{.mark} to close]{.underline} the

[[caused]{.mark} the oil [price to rise]{.mark} by almost
**[4%]{.mark}**.]{.underline}110 If the Strait of Hormuz were actually
closed, the subsequent effect on the oil price could be drastic as a
mere fraction of the oil passing through the Strait can be replaced by
pipeline or truck transport.111 Research undertaken by the Netherlands
Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (CPB) indicates that a 20% increase
in the price of oil causes economic growth in the Netherlands to drop by
0.4% within a one year period and 0.6% in a two year period.112

This week, [a]{.underline} routine [rotation of]{.underline} U.S.
aircraft [carriers is taking place in the Middle East]{.underline}, with
the potential for three carrier strike groups to be on station in the
U.S. Fifth Fleet\'s area of operations and a fourth carrier strike group
based in Japan about a week\'s transit from the region. Next week, Gen.
Michael Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will travel to
Israel to meet with senior Israeli officials. [And [Iran is
scheduling]{.mark} another set of [war games]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
Persian Gulf for February [[that]{.mark} will [focus
on]{.mark}]{.underline} the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\'
[irregular tactics for [closing the Strait]{.mark}]{.underline} of
Hormuz.∂ While **[[tensions are escalating]{.mark} in the Persian
Gulf]{.underline}**, the financial crisis in Europe has continued, with
downgrades in France\'s credit rating the latest blow. Meanwhile, China
continued its struggle to maintain exports in the face of economic
weakness among its major customers while inflation continued to increase
the cost of Chinese exports.∂ Fundamental changes in how Europe and
China work and their long-term consequences represent the major systemic
shifts in the international system. In the more immediate future,
however, the U.S.-Iranian dynamic has the most serious potential
consequences for the world.∂ The U.S.-Iranian Dynamic∂ The increasing
tensions in the region are not unexpected. As we have argued for some
time, the U.S. invasion of Iraq and the subsequent decision to withdraw
created a massive power vacuum in Iraq that Iran needed --- and was able
--- to fill. Iran and Iraq fought a brutal war in the 1980s that caused
about 1 million Iranian casualties, and Iran\'s fundamental national
interest is assuring that no Iraqi regime able to threaten Iranian
national security re-emerges. The U.S. invasion and withdrawal from Iraq
provided Iran an opportunity to secure its western frontier, one it
could not pass on.∂ If Iran does come to have a dominant influence in
Iraq --- and I don\'t mean Iran turning Iraq into a satellite ---
several things follow. Most important, the status of the Arabian
Peninsula is subject to change. On paper, Iran has the most substantial
conventional military force of any nation in the Persian Gulf. Absent
outside players, power on paper is not insignificant. While
technologically sophisticated, the military strength of the Arabian
Peninsula nations on paper is much smaller, and they lack the Iranian
military\'s ideologically committed manpower.∂ But Iran\'s direct
military power is more the backdrop than the main engine of Iranian
power. It is the strength of Tehran\'s covert capabilities and influence
that makes Iran significant. Iran\'s covert intelligence capability is
quite good. It has spent decades building political alliances by a range
of means, and not only by nefarious methods. The Iranians have worked
among the Shia, but not exclusively so; they have built a network of
influence among a range of classes and religious and ethnic groups. And
they have systematically built alliances and relationships with
significant figures to counter overt U.S. power. With U.S. military
power departing Iraq, Iran\'s relationships become all the more
valuable.∂ [The [withdrawal]{.mark} of]{.underline} U.S. [forces
[has]{.mark} had [a]{.mark} **profound [psychological impact]{.mark}**
on the political elites of the Persian Gulf.]{.underline} Since the
decline of British power after World War II, the United States has been
the guarantor of the Arabian Peninsula\'s elites and therefore of the
flow of oil from the region. The foundation of that guarantee has been
military power, as seen in the response to Iraq\'s invasion of Kuwait in
1990. [The **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates still [[has substantial]{.mark}
military [power]{.mark} in the Persian Gulf, and its air and naval
[forces **could**]{.mark} **likely [cope]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} any
overt [provocation]{.mark} by Iran.∂]{.underline} But that\'s not how
the Iranians operate. For all their rhetoric, they are cautious in their
policies. This does not mean they are passive. It simply means that they
avoid high-risk moves. They will rely on their covert capabilities and
relationships. Those relationships now exist in an environment in which
many reasonable Arab leaders see a shift in the balance of power, with
the United States growing weaker and less predictable in the region and
Iran becoming stronger. This provides fertile soil for Iranian allies to
pressure regional regimes into accommodations with Iran.∂ The Syrian
Angle∂ Events in Syria compound this situation. The purported imminent
collapse of Syrian President Bashar al Assad\'s regime in Syria has
proved less imminent than many in the West imagined. At the same time,
the isolation of the al Assad regime by the West --- and more important,
by other Arab countries --- has created a situation where the regime is
more dependent than ever on Iran.∂ Should the al Assad regime --- or the
Syrian regime without al Assad --- survive, Iran would therefore enjoy
tremendous influence with Syria, as well as with Hezbollah in Lebanon.
The current course in Iraq coupled with the survival of an Alawite
regime in Syria would create an Iranian sphere of influence stretching
from western Afghanistan to the Mediterranean. This would represent a
fundamental shift in the regional balance of power and probably would
redefine Iranian relations with the Arabian Peninsula. This is obviously
in Iran\'s interest. It is not in the interests of the United States,
however.∂ The United States has sought to head this off via a twofold
response. Clandestinely, it has engaged in an active campaign of
sabotage and assassination targeting Iran\'s nuclear efforts. Publicly,
it has created a sanctions regime against Iran, most recently targeting
Iran\'s oil exports. However, the latter effort faces many challenges.∂
Japan, the No. 2 buyer of Iranian crude, has pledged its support but has
not outlined concrete plans to reduce its purchases. The Chinese and
Indians --- Iran\'s No. 1 and 3 buyers of crude, respectively --- will
continue to buy from Iran despite increased U.S. pressure. In spite of
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner\'s visit last week, the Chinese
are not prepared to impose sanctions, and the Russians are not likely to
enforce sanctions even if they agreed to them. Turkey is unwilling to
create a confrontation with Iran and is trying to remain a vital trade
conduit for the Iranians regardless of sanctions. At the same time,
while the Europeans seem prepared to participate in harder-hitting
sanctions on Iranian oil, they already have delayed action on these
sanctions and certainly are in no position politically or otherwise to
participate in military action. The European economic crisis is at root
a political crisis, so even if the Europeans could add significant
military weight, which they generally lack, concerted action of any sort
is unlikely.∂ Neither, for that matter, does the United States have the
ability to do much militarily. Invading Iran is out of the question. The
mountainous geography of Iran, a nation of about 70 million people,
makes direct occupation impossible given available American forces.∂ Air
operations against Iran are an option, but they could not be confined to
nuclear facilities. Iran still doesn\'t have nuclear weapons, and while
nuclear weapons would compound the strategic problem, the problem would
still exist without them. The center of gravity of Iran\'s power is the
relative strength of its conventional forces in the region. Absent
those, Iran would be less capable of wielding covert power, as the
psychological matrix would shift.∂ An air campaign against Iran\'s
conventional forces would play to American military strengths, but it
has two problems. First, it would be an extended campaign, one lasting
months. Iran\'s capabilities are large and dispersed, and as seen in
Desert Storm and Kosovo against weaker opponents, such operations take a
long time and are not guaranteed to be effective. Second, the Iranians
have counters. One, of course, is the Strait of Hormuz. The second is
the use of its special operations forces and allies in and out of the
region to conduct terrorist attacks. An extended air campaign coupled
with terrorist attacks could increase distrust of American power rather
than increase it among U.S. allies, to say nothing of the question of
whether Washington could sustain political support in a coalition or
within the United States itself.∂ The Covert Option∂ The United States
and Israel both have covert options as well. They have networks of
influence in the region and highly capable covert forces, which they
have said publicly that they would use to limit Iran\'s acquisition of
nuclear weapons without resorting to overt force. We assume, though we
lack evidence, that the assassination of the Iranian chemist associated
with the country\'s nuclear program last week was either a U.S. or
Israeli operation or some combination of the two. Not only did it
eliminate a scientist, it also bred insecurity and morale problems among
those working on the program. It also signaled the region that the
United States and Israel have options inside Iran.∂ The U.S. desire to
support an Iranian anti-government movement generally has failed. Tehran
showed in 2009 that it could suppress demonstrations, and it was obvious
that the demonstrators did not have the widespread support needed to
overcome such repression. Though the United States has sought to support
internal dissidents in Iran since 1979, it has not succeeded in
producing a meaningful threat to the clerical regime. Therefore, covert
operations are being aimed directly at the nuclear program with the hope
that successes there might ripple through other, more immediately
significant sectors.∂ As we have long argued, the Iranians already have
a \"nuclear option,\" namely, [the prospect of [blockading]{.mark} the
Strait of [Hormuz, through which]{.mark} roughly 35 percent of seaborne
crude and [20 percent of]{.mark} the world\'s traded [oil passes]{.mark}
daily. **Doing so [would hurt them, too,]{.mark} of course**. [But
failing to deter]{.mark} an air or covert campaign, [they might]{.mark}
choose to [close off]{.mark} the strait. [**Temporarily**
disrupting]{.mark} the flow of oil, [**even intermittently**, could
**rapidly** create a global]{.mark} economic [crisis given]{.mark} the
[**fragility** of the]{.mark} world [economy]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Iran\'s repeated threats to close]{.underline} the Strait of [Hormuz
are a pivotal part of a]{.underline} military [strategy based on
psychological and asymmetric warfare. Blocking the strategic
waterway]{.underline}, through which 90 percent of Persian Gulf oil
flows to the outside world, [would have sweeping implications for
regional security and global oil markets]{.underline}. It may be [the
Islamic Republic\'s **most potent weapon**]{.underline}. Tehran has also
hinted it would retaliate against U.S. forces, notably the Fifth Fleet
based in the Persian Gulf, if it is attacked.∂ [Since]{.underline} the
[1979]{.underline} revolution, [[Iran has]{.mark} developed
**[sufficient]{.mark} military [capabilities to back up its
threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The]{.underline}]{.mark} Revolutionary

powerful [American vessels]{.underline}. [Iran could]{.underline} also
[fire missiles at U.S. warships]{.underline} from its 1000 mile-long
Gulf coastline. An even more controversial
[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}ian move [[would]{.underline}]{.mark} be
**[[scatter]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing **[[mines]{.underline}]{.mark}**
either [near the Strait]{.underline} or in the Persian Gulf, [[which

that, if that happens, we can defeat that. And [so the simple answer is,
**yes, they can block it.**]{.underline}9∂ Iran's naval capabilities are
divided among the two main branches of its armed forces -- the regular
Islamic Republic of Iran Navy (IRIN, regular Navy), a holdover of the
military of the former Shah of Iran, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard
Corps Navy (IRGC Navy). The IRIN controls the larger coastal combatant
ships such as six Corvette-class (i.e., light frigate) ships. It also
operates Iran's three Kilo-class submarines purchased in the 1990s from
Russia. The more politically powerful IRGC Navy is a branch of the IRGC,
which is considered allied to Iran's hardliners and which plays a role
in internal security and support for pro-Iranian movements in the Middle
East. The IRIN, with its larger ships, has been assigned to patrol the
more open waters of the Gulf of Oman; the IRGC Navy, with its lighter
fleet, is assigned to close-in waters of the Strait of Hormuz and
Persian Gulf. As a hallmark of its role as guardian of the Islamic
revolution, [the [IRGC]{.mark} Navy has long been perceived
as]{.underline} more [willing to [undertake operations **not**]{.mark}

mines of **[[different types]{.underline}]{.mark}**, including moored
mines, advanced mines such as the MDM-3 that can be dropped from

could reduce the risk to mine-clearing forces, but lengthen the total

its [**[small fleet]{.underline}** [and **unconventional
tactics**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [such as
["swarming,"]{.mark}]{.underline} which it has developed since the end
of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988. Swarming is characterized by deployment of
dozens, or perhaps even hundreds of cruise-missile or other armed small
boats, [launched from different bases, to [converge on and attack
a]{.mark} discreet [target]{.mark} such as a warship or oil
tanker]{.underline}.12 [Numerous U.S. observers are particularly
concerned about]{.underline} the use of [such tactics]{.underline},
particularly [[in]{.mark} the]{.underline} relatively **[[close
confines]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of]{.underline} the Strait of
[Hormuz]{.underline}.13 To carry out this tactic, among others, the IRGC
Navy controls a large number of generally smaller ships of many
different classes. These include: 10 China-supplied Hudong-class missile
patrol boats bought in the 1990s and equipped with C-802 sea-skimming
cruise missiles; 9 C-14 missile boats, also made by China and received
in 2006; another China-made boat, the MK-13 patrol craft that can be
armed with cruise missiles and torpedoes; about 40 Iran-made patrol
craft called the PEYKAAP; and 30-40 Swedish-made Boghammer fast-patrol
boats. Iran also has an unspecified number of small boats designed in
Italy (Fabio Buzzi Design) but made in Iran itself.∂ •
**[[Submarines]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Torpedoes]{.underline}]{.mark}
launched from Iran's three Kilo-class submarines or its up to nearly a
dozen mini or midget submarines [could [inflict]{.mark}]{.underline}
potentially [**[devastating damage]{.mark}** on a warship]{.underline},
as shown by the March 2010 sinking of the South Korean corvette Cheonan
by a torpedo that South Korea, United States, and other countries
concluded was fired by a North Korean mini-submarine. Iran's decision to
base its three Russian-made Kilo-class submarines outside the Strait of
Hormuz suggests that the [ships would be used during a confrontation to
threaten surface ships]{.underline} operating in the Gulf of Oman.∂ •
**[Coastal [Cruise Missiles]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The IRGC Navy
controls several batteries of]{.underline} CSS-C-2 "Seersucker" and
China-made C-801 and C-802 [anti-ship missiles]{.underline} emplaced
along Iran's coast. [These]{.underline} missiles [can be [readily

### Yes Closure- A2: Economic Self-Interest 

#### Economic and diplomatic blowback won't check

[[According to the conventional narrative]{.mark} of]{.underline} how
[escalation]{.underline} would progress, in response to the imposition
of \"crippling\" sanctions \-- such as full implementation of central
banking restrictions \-- some sort of oil embargo, or military strikes,
Tehran would have the choice of either mining the strait so as to make
commerce through it extremely hazardous or of forcefully imposing a full
naval blockade, blocking passage between the Persian Gulf and the
Arabian Sea. The U.S. Navy, possibly with the aid of allied states,
would in turn swiftly attempt to clear the strait. If the Iranians did
not back down, all-out war would be the likely result. Those who regard
Iranian threats to close the strait as a bluff base their view on two
assumptions: (1) [[Iran would never close]{.mark} the strait [due
to]{.mark} its [economic dependence]{.mark} upon the vital choke point,
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} (2) [[any attempt]{.underline}]{.mark} to
close the strait [[would bring the weight of the world]{.mark} down on
the Islamic Republic]{.underline}.∂ The Iranian rationale: Why do it?∂
Look at the issue **[[through the Tehran prism,
however]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and **[[both]{.mark} of these
assumptions [appear uncertain]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To comprehend how
Tehran could and would actually retaliate in the strait, one must first
understand the Iranian rationale in dealing with the West. [[For
Tehran]{.mark}, what is [at stake is the]{.mark} concept of the [modern
global commons]{.mark}]{.underline}, in which states trade and otherwise
interact with each other. [Iran believes that international law is
fundamentally incapable]{.underline} of protecting its interests, that
due to the sway the Western powers maintain over international bodies,
which they routinely use to advance their own foreign policy aims, the
cards are stacked against the Islamic Republic no matter what it does.∂
For example, Iran sees itself as a victim of terrorism and thus does not
take seriously the charge that it is responsible for promoting terrorism
itself. For Iran, the logic of the nonproliferation regime, which
supposedly protects the rights of states to peaceful nuclear technology,
is also deeply suspect. Though every International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) report concerning Iran has confirmed that there is no evidence of
diversion of nuclear material from peaceful to potentially military use
and though the IAEA has access to and cameras installed in all of the
country\'s nuclear sites, Iran is still labeled an imminent nuclear
threat by the United States and its allies.∂ The Iranian approach to the
Strait of Hormuz is linked to its general skepticism of international
law. [[Iran feels]{.mark} that [its economy]{.mark}]{.underline}, which
has now been subject to sanctions for over three decades, [[is]{.mark}
being [singled out]{.mark} arbitrarily]{.underline}. It does not accept
the argument that it is being sanctioned due to nuclear proliferation,
terrorism, and human rights concerns, as it is surrounded by neighbors,
some of them client regimes of the West, whose record in those areas it
regards as markedly worse. [If what [Tehran]{.mark} perceives as the
unfair denial of its access to the global economy reaches a certain
level, it [may]{.mark} well [be provoked to disrupt access to a]{.mark}
crucial geographical [facilitator of that economy]{.mark} \-- the Strait
of [Hormuz]{.mark}]{.underline}.∂ The Iranian response:
\"Somalia-ization\" of the strait∂ [[Iran is fully aware]{.mark} that
any [blockade]{.mark}]{.underline} or direct attack on such a crucial
choke point [[would incite]{.mark} massive
[retaliation]{.mark}]{.underline} by the international community, led by
the United States. It understands that such a move would completely
isolate it from its fellow OPEC members and invite a coalitional war on
the country.∂ [[So is Iran bluffing]{.underline}]{.mark} when it claims
that it will use oil and its transport as a weapon? **[[Absolutely
not]{.underline}]{.mark}**.∂ In the event of an escalation of the
Iran-U.S. conflict, [the Iranians will avoid any semblance of the
traditional narrative that involves an overt attempt to shut down the
Strait of Hormuz. Instead, [Iran could]{.mark} seek to [create
perpetual, low-grade instability]{.mark} in the strait, mostly [through
asymmetric means]{.mark}]{.underline}, with the objective of making it
an aquatic \"no-man\'s land,\" similar to what has transpired in the
waters off the Horn of Africa. Rather than follow the example of Gamal
Abdel Nasser in the Suez Crisis, [Iran can utilize highly advanced
[piracy and sabotage]{.mark} tactics, while looking to **[maintain
plausible deniability]{.mark}**]{.underline}.∂ This approach has three
distinct advantages. The first is that [[it will still allow Iran to
utilize]{.mark} the [straits, with **manageable consequences for
its**]{.mark} **own [economy]{.mark}**. The most challenging aspect
would be the adaptations required in transport strategy, but
[the]{.mark} country\'s [long coastline would mitigate]{.mark} that
concern]{.underline}. Second, it will provide Iran with regional and
global leverage without the unified international opprobrium that would
come with a naval blockade. Policy makers and military strategists among
its adversaries might well know who was causing instability in the
strait, but without an overt, conventional attempt to close the passage,
would be unable to stop it. And third, perhaps most importantly, this
enterprise could be extended indefinitely and in direct proportion to
how long and to what extent the United States and its allies maintain
heightened pressure on Iran.∂ The matter of what [specific
[tactics]{.mark}]{.underline} would be employed remains speculative,
contingent upon the regional and global strategic environment present at
the time Iran\'s strategists decide to take action. They [[could run the
gamut of sabotaging]{.mark} ships]{.underline} in all sorts of
asymmetric ways [t[o \"soft\" mining and obstruction]{.mark} tactics
that could be [blamed on \"pirates.\"]{.mark}]{.underline} If regional
exporting states collaborated with the United States on an Iran oil
embargo, those measures could be accompanied by infrastructure sabotage,
as seen in conflicts in southeast Turkey, Nigeria, or Egypt.

#### Iran [perceives]{.underline} closure to be in economic self-interest

**Lacey 12** (Jim Lacey, Ph.D. in Military History from Leeds
University, retired from the Army Reserves in 2005, after 24 years of
service, 1-4-2012, \"Iran's Hormuz Threat\", National Review Online,
http://www.nationalreview.com/article/287076/irans-hormuz-threat-jim-lacey)

For the past two weeks [[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[[committed]{.mark} a sizable portion of its [military to
rehearsing]{.mark} how it would]{.underline} go about
[clos]{.underline}ing the [[Hormuz]{.underline}]{.mark} Strait. For the
most part, [strategic [analysts]{.mark} yawned, and [declared
Iran]{.mark}ian blustering to be [an empty threat]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Judging from the oil markets' relatively muted reaction, it appears that
most of the folks who bet big money on what happens in the Persian Gulf
share this opinion. So what is this consensus based on? First and
foremost, it relies on the belief that the Iranian leadership will make
a number of rational calculations and decisions concerning their own and
their country's future. Personally, I am not sure of the wisdom of
betting on the rationality of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and a few globally
disconnected mullahs.∂ As the "Iran is bluffing" crowd sees it, Iran
does not the [possess]{.underline} the [military
wherewithal]{.underline} to close the strait: disrupt traffic, yes;
close it, no. [[Everyone]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[assumes]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[Iran's leaders
understand]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[closing the strait would]{.mark}
mean]{.underline} that [Iran's own oil shipments would [cease]{.mark}.
As [Iran's oil exports]{.mark} account for]{.underline} a almost [a
fifth of its GDP and]{.underline} fund [60 percent of its national
budget, even]{.underline} a [temporary closing]{.underline} of the
strait [would be an economic catastrophe]{.underline}. Moreover, as Iran
still relies on imports for much of its refined fuel, any closure of the
strait would rapidly shut down huge segments of its non-oil economy.∂ As
the Wall Street Journal pointed out last week, [however]{.underline},
these [Iranian exercises closely coincide with]{.underline} "the U.S.
and Europe at last mustering the gumption to target \[with
[sanctions]{.underline}\] Iran's multibillion-dollar oil industry." If
sanctions do put a serious crimp in Iran's oil and gas exports, the
[[mullahs may decide **there is little difference** between]{.mark} the
[West]{.mark}'s [closing]{.mark} off their [access to export]{.mark}
revenues [and their doing it themselves]{.mark}]{.underline} [---
[except]{.underline}]{.mark} that in the latter circumstance **[[the
rest of the world would share Iran's pain]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [As
the]{.underline} political and [economic situation in Iran moves from
dismal to catastrophic, [one can **easily envision internal
scenarios**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[where closing]{.underline}]{.mark}
the Strait of [[Hormuz]{.mark} begins to [appears]{.mark} as a
**[rational]{.mark} option**]{.underline}.∂ It may be true that, even if
Iran wanted to close the strait, its military, when confronted by the
U.S. Fifth Fleet, would be incapable of doing so. One should not,
however, be sanguine about this being the case. [Iran has hundreds of
ballistic missiles]{.underline}, three Kilo-class [submarines, and a
host of fast attack boats]{.underline} (armed [with anti-ship
missiles]{.underline}). [There is no end to the mischief a clever
opponent can make with such an arsenal]{.underline}. For instance, in
the 2002 Millennium Challenge war game, retired Marine lieutenant
general Paul Van Riper, playing the Iranian side's commander, caused so
much damage to the U.S. and allied fleet that the game had to be
stopped. Only after the fleet was resurrected from the bottom of the sea
was the game able to continue.

#### It's a calculated diversion

Institute and a former senior director for Middle East affairs at the

[What is Iran\'s aim]{.underline}, then, [in threatening to close the
Strait]{.underline} and attack U.S. forces?∂ The [Iran]{.underline}ian
regime \-- like the North Koreans and others \--
[understands]{.underline} that [rattling a saber]{.underline} can be
more beneficial than actually using it. [[Iran\'s]{.mark} bellicose
rhetoric and [behavior are aimed at]{.mark} **both [domestic and
international audiences]{.mark}**]{.underline}.∂ [Inside [Iran]{.mark},
the regime has [struggled with]{.mark}]{.underline} internal divisions,
a growing (if temporarily suppressed) opposition and, perhaps most
urgently, [a [crumbling economy. The regime may
calculate]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[provoking
tensions]{.underline}]{.mark} externally [[can **divert domestic
attention from these**]{.mark} **crises**]{.underline}. If this is its
aim, however, there is little evidence that it is succeeding. Indeed,
these actions may prove counterproductive domestically, as they provide
the regime\'s opponents with ammunition to accuse it of increasingly
reckless and damaging policies. Some observers speculate that [[hardline
groups]{.mark} in Iran]{.underline} \-- for example, the Revolutionary
Guards \-- [[may **want**]{.underline}]{.mark} an [actual]{.underline}
(albeit limited) [[**conflict** to **consolidate**]{.mark} their
**[domestic control]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But so far, the regime has
preferred leveling threats and working through proxies to maintain
plausible deniability.∂ Externally, [Iran]{.underline} may hope that its
actions will produce several responses that will prove useful. First, it
[is relying on the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [to demonstrate restraint to avoid
conflict]{.underline}. [Iran]{.underline} has [engaged in brazen
provocations in recent years \-- including mock attacks on U.S.
vessels]{.underline}, the seizure of Western hostages, and attacks on
U.S. targets \-- [that]{.underline} have [provoked limited
[Western]{.mark} response. This **[restraint]{.mark}**]{.underline} - -
along with the uncertainty about the U.S. regional posture after
withdrawal from Iraq \-- [[may]{.underline}]{.mark} prove
counterproductive by **[[feed]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing **[[Iranian
commanders\']{.mark} sense of [impunity]{.mark}]{.underline}**.∂ Second,
the [Iran]{.underline}ian regime almost certainly
[understands]{.underline} that [Western countries are worried
about]{.underline} an [increase in global oil prices at a fragile time
for the global economy. [Tehran\'s actions]{.mark}]{.underline} [[are
meant to]{.underline} **[sharpen]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[these
[fears]{.mark}]{.underline}** [by increasing oil prices]{.underline} in
the near-term [and holding out]{.underline} the [prospect for sharper
increases down the road. The regime\'s hope]{.underline}, presumably,
[is]{.underline} that [oil-dependent countries]{.underline} \-- both
consumers and producers \-- will [focus on defusing the current
crisis]{.underline} rather than on Iran\'s nuclear program, and may
delay plans to sanction Iran\'s oil exports or even urge the United
States to reduce its military posture in the Gulf. But the United States
and European Union have thus far refused to play along, brushing off
Iran\'s threats and moving forward with oil sanctions.

#### No alternatives

In [[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}\'s confrontation with the West over its
nuclear program, the Islamic Republic [[has]{.mark} one undisputed
weapon: The [ability to block the **most important oil**]{.mark}
**transit [choke point in the world]{.mark}**.∂
[Although]{.mark}]{.underline} military strategists and diplomatic
[[experts]{.mark} have [worried about Iran\'s capability to **throw the
global economy into chaos** for]{.mark} more than three [decades, there
has been **little progress in developing alternative**]{.mark}
**petroleum [routes]{.mark}**]{.underline} to defuse the power of
Iran\'s threat to block the Strait of Hormuz.∂ Tensions increased last
week after Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak issued a blunt warning
that time was running out for stopping Iran\'s nuclear program. Iran has
claimed that its uranium enrichment facilities are for peaceful energy
purposes, not for weaponry. After a visit by United Nations inspectors,
and plans for a return visit later this month, Iran\'s state-run news
agency termed the talks \"positive and constructive.\" But Israel
signaled that the U.N. diplomatic efforts and an oil embargo led by the
United States and Europe were not progressing quickly enough to defuse
Iran\'s nuclear threat. If Iran moved its nuclear facilities into
underground Bunkers, Barak said, it could be \"too late\" to destroy
them. Barak\'s comment raises the fear that Israel might mount a
unilateral air strike.∂ Defense strategists believe such a move would
trigger a retaliatory Iranian action to block the Strait of Hormuz.∂ An
Artery at Risk∂ [There are hundreds of choke points that constrain the
flow of oil around the world]{.underline}, from the Strait of Malacca in
the east to the Panama Canal in the west. [But [**none** matches the
importance of]{.mark} the Strait of [Hormuz]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
2011, an average 16 million barrels of oil per day, or [[20 percent
of]{.mark} the oil [traded]{.mark} worldwide,
[moved]{.mark}]{.underline} by tanker [[through]{.mark} the]{.underline}
173-mile (280-kilometer) [waterway]{.underline} between Iran and Oman
that links the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the seas beyond.∂
The strait\'s narrowest point is 31 miles (50 kilometers) wide, but
navigation is even more constrained. Tankers must move on either an
outbound or an inbound shipping lane, each of them 2 miles (3.2
kilometers) wide, separated by a buffer zone of the same width. In 2011,
about 14 outbound crude oil tankers passed through the conduit daily,
with about 77 percent of the cargo headed toward Asia and the Pacific.∂
[A look at history underscores the **economic risk** that a Hormuz
closure represents. The largest oil market disruption]{.underline} ever
[occurred in]{.underline} August [1990]{.underline}, when Iraq\'s
invasion of Kuwait took 4.3 million barrels per day of oil off the
market---about 6.5 percent of world supply. That [stoppage caused world
oil prices to **double**]{.underline} (from about \$20 to \$40 per
barrel). But a [blockade of Hormuz would cut off nearly four times as
much oil as the Kuwait crisis did, disrupting a share of the oil market
three times greater. And this [unprecedented throttling]{.mark} of
supply [would come]{.mark} at a time [when]{.mark} oil is more than
\$100 per barrel and [the world economy is weak]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Iran to \"shut\" the Strait of Hormuz following a thinly veiled threat
June 28 by Maj. Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, commander of Iran\'s
Revolutionary Guard Corps, to do just that.∂ This back-and-forth
rhetoric makes it worthwhile to examine Iran\'s military capability
along this vital international waterway.∂ The Strait of Hormuz is 21
miles across at its narrowest. The shipping traffic corridor itself is a
mere 6 miles wide, with 2 miles each for incoming and outgoing traffic,
separated by a 2-mile buffer. More than 90 percent of all oil exported
from the Persian Gulf, or nearly 17 million barrels per day (bpd),
transits this outgoing lane. This is nearly two-fifths of the world\'s
oil supply.∂ [[If]{.mark} the strait [were closed, **only**]{.mark}
**about [3 million]{.mark} bpd** of that [could realistically be

[As many as 13 million people in Yemen are facing
starvation]{.underline} [in]{.underline} what could [be the "worst
famine seen anywhere in the world for 100 years]{.underline}", according
to the UN. [The Middle Eastern nation has been embroiled in violent
conflict]{.underline} for more than three years, [its people suffering
desperate privation and living under the constant threat of air
strikes]{.underline}. Here's how the "forgotten war" started. Who are
the two sides? The battle is being fought between Houthi rebels, members
of the Zaidi Shia Muslim minority said to be backed by Iran, and Yemeni
government forces supported by a 10-nation coalition of mostly Sunni
Muslim majority nations led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE. [The foreign
powers involved have been accused of exploiting the crisis to expand
their respective spheres of interest within the region]{.underline}. The
Houthis -- disillusioned with the reign of President Abbrabbuh Mansur
Hadi since he replaced Ali Abdullah Saleh following the Arab Spring
uprising of 2011 -- marched on the capital city of Sanaa from the north
in September 2014 and forced him out office. President Hadi fled to
Riyadh via the Port of Aden and appealed for help. [Saudi Arabia duly
retaliated against the rebels in March 2015, raining down brutal air
strikes as part of operation "Decisive Storm"]{.underline} at the
instigation of Mohammed bin Salman, the country's defence minister prior
to his accession to position of crown prince. While [the Saudi-led
coalition began]{.underline} by targeting Houthi military strongholds,
its [bombing]{.underline} campaign quickly shifted to [civilian
targets]{.underline}, according to Professor Martha Mundy of the World
Peace Foundation (WPF). [These included "water and transport
infrastructure, food production and distribution, roads and transport,
schools, cultural monuments, clinics and hospitals, and houses, fields
and flocks,"]{.underline} the academic states in her recent report on
the crisis, The Strategies of the Coalition in the Yemen War: Aerial
Bombardment and Food War. [The countryside has meanwhile been littered
with landmines and other explosive devices as a result of the
fighting]{.underline}, posing a further threat to human life on terra
firma and making the ploughing of fields impossible. The Saudis allege a
million have been laid by the Houthis as a trap for them over the course
of the last three years, with an estimated 500,000 left over by al-Qaeda
in addition -- a terror group with whom the state is still battling in
the east of Yemen, further complicating the picture. "This is one of
Yemen's toughest problems now. [It will take a lifetime to
sort,]{.underline}" officer Ali Salah told The Independent. Planned
peace talks collapsed last month after the Houthi delegation failed to
attend, prompting accusations from the Yemeni foreign minister Khaled
al-Yamani they were "trying to sabotage the negotiations." But Houthi
leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi insisted his side had been deliberately
prevented from being able to attend by strategic road blocks. Why are
the US and UK supporting Saudi Arabia? While the UK, the US and France
have called on the two sides to negotiate a peace settlement, all three
have been roundly criticised for failing to stand up to Saudi Arabia to
protect their commercial interests. The UK has sold more than £4.6bn
worth of arms to the Saudis since the beginning of the Yemeni conflict
in March 2015, according to the Campaign Against the Arms Trade,
including aircraft, drones, grenades, missiles and tanks. A poll
published in September by YouGov for Save the Children and Avaaz
meanwhile found that 63 per cent of the British public oppose the
British government allowing sales to continue, with just 13 per cent
supporting the trade. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, previously
CIA director, recently elected to continue US support for the Saudi air
strikes rather than risk \$2bn (£1.5bn) of weapon sales to the Gulf.
According to The Wall Street Journal, reporting on a leaked memo, Mr
Pompeo "overruled concerns from most of the state department specialists
involved in the debate who were worried about the rising civilian death
toll in Yemen". While the UK and US do not participate in the Saudi-led
bombings, the US provides aerial refuelling and logistical support while
UK military personnel are stationed in command and control centres. How
many people have died or been forced to flee as refugees? [At least
7,641 people have been killed in the conflict and millions displaced,
although the total is thought to be closer to 10,000.]{.underline} In
August 2018, the bloodiest month of fighting so far this year, 981
civilians were killed, 300 of whom were children, according to the UN's
Human Rights Office. Prior to that, 6,660 civilians were killed and
10,563 injured between March 2015 and August this year, according to
conservative estimates from the UN. Why is Yemen on the brink of a
famine? [Strict Saudi blockades and travel restrictions have prevented
food and aid reaching Yemen]{.underline}, [causing the price of food
within the country to skyrocket]{.underline} and leaving desperate
families unable to afford basic supplies from markets. The WPF report,
accusing the Saudi coalition of using starvation as a weapon of war to
create untenable conditions for the Houthis, states that no fewer than
220 fishing boats have been destroyed by bombs along the country's Red
Sea coast. This has meant the local fish catch is down by 50 per cent.
Air strikes on the Port of Hodeida in June likewise appear a deliberate
attempt to disable a facility from which 70 per cent of imports enter
Yemen. Coalition forces cut a crucial supply route between Sanaa and
Hodeida in September. The prevailing hardships as a result of
bomb-damage have hit supplies of electricity and fuel, making basic
arable farming difficult, while ranchers have been forced to sell their
cattle to make ends meet. [As a result of all this, almost
three-quarters of Yemen's 27.58 million population are currently reliant
on aid]{.underline}. Of that total of approximately 22.2 million[, 8.4
million are starving]{.underline}, [1.8 million of those being children,
according to Unicef.]{.underline} "The problem is not funding but space
-- we have only six beds and can treat a maximum of 35 people a month.
We are forced to turn people away," Dr Abha Abdalla said. ["It is bleak.
We are losing the fight against famine,"]{.underline} UN humanitarian
chief Mark Lowcock recently told the Security Council.

CHEST HEAVING AND EYES FLUTTERING, the 3-year-old boy lay silently on a
hospital bed in the highland town of Hajjah, a bag of bones fighting for
breath. His father, Ali al-Hajaji, stood anxiously over him. Mr. Hajaji
had already lost one son three weeks earlier to the epidemic of hunger
sweeping across Yemen. Now he feared that a second was slipping away. It
wasn't for a lack of food in the area: The stores outside the hospital
gate were filled with goods and the markets were bustling. But Mr.
Hajaji couldn't afford any of it because prices were rising too fast. "I
can barely buy a piece of stale bread," he said. "That's why my children
are dying before my eyes." [The devastating war in Yemen has gotten more
attention recently]{.underline} as outrage over the killing of a Saudi
dissident in Istanbul has turned a spotlight on Saudi actions elsewhere.
The harshest criticism of the Saudi-led war has focused on the
[airstrikes]{.underline} that [have killed thousands of
civilians]{.underline} at weddings, funerals and on school buses, [aided
by American-supplied bombs and intelligence.]{.underline} But [aid
experts and United Nations officials say a more insidious form of
warfare is also being waged in Yemen]{.underline}, [an economic
war]{.underline} [that]{.underline} is exacting a far greater toll on
civilians and [now risks tipping the country into a famine of
catastrophic proportions.]{.underline} Under the leadership of Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi-led coalition and its Yemeni
allies have imposed a raft of punitive economic measures aimed at
undercutting the Houthi rebels who control northern Yemen. But these
actions --- including periodic blockades, stringent import restrictions
and withholding the salaries of about a million civil servants --- have
landed on the backs of civilians, laying the economy to waste and
driving millions deeper into poverty. Those measures have inflicted a
slow-burn toll: infrastructure destroyed, jobs lost, a weakening
currency and soaring prices. But in recent weeks the economic collapse
has gathered pace at alarming speed, causing top United Nations
officials to revise their predictions of famine. "There is now a clear
and present danger of an imminent and great, big famine engulfing
Yemen," Mark Lowcock, the under secretary for humanitarian affairs, told
the Security Council on Tuesday[. Eight million Yemenis already depend
on emergency food aid to survive, he said, a figure that could soon rise
to 14 million, or half Yemen's population.]{.underline} "People think
famine is just a lack of food," said Alex de Waal, author of "Mass
Starvation" which analyzes recent man-made famines. "But in Yemen it's
about a war on the economy." Ali al-Hajaji and his wife, Mohamediah
Mohammed, lost one son to hunger. Now they fear losing a second. When
Shaher became ill, Mr. Hajaji tried a folk remedy and burned him,
leaving scars on his chest. Shaadi, 4 years old, lies in a grave marked
by a single broken rock. The signs are everywhere, cutting across
boundaries of class, tribe and region. Unpaid university professors
issue desperate appeals for help on social media. Doctors and teachers
are forced to sell their gold, land or cars to feed their families. On
the streets of the capital, Sana, an elderly woman begs for alms with a
loudspeaker. "Help me," the woman, Zahra Bajali, calls out. "I have a
sick husband. I have a house for rent. Help." And in the hushed hunger
wards, ailing infants hover between life and death. [Of nearly two
million malnourished children in Yemen, 400,000 are considered
critically ill --- a figure projected to rise by one
quarter]{.underline} in the coming months. "We are being crushed," said
Dr. Mekkia Mahdi at the health clinic in Aslam, an impoverished
northwestern town that has been swamped with refugees fleeing the
fighting in Hudaydah, an embattled port city 90 miles to the south.
Flitting between the beds at her spartan clinic, she cajoled mothers,
dispensed orders to medics and spoon-fed milk to sickly infants. For
some it was too late: the night before, an 11-month old boy had died. He
weighed five and a half pounds. Looking around her, Dr. Mahdi could not
fathom the Western obsession with the Saudi killing of Jamal Khashoggi
in Istanbul. "We're surprised the Khashoggi case is getting so much
attention while millions of Yemeni children are suffering," she said.
"Nobody gives a damn about them." She tugged on the flaccid skin of a
drowsy 7-year-old girl with stick-like arms. "Look," she said. "No meat.
Only bones." The embassy of Saudi Arabia in Washington did not respond
to questions about the country's policies in Yemen. But Saudi officials
have defended their actions, citing rockets fired across their border by
the Houthis, an armed group professing Zaidi Islam, an offshoot of
Shiism, that Saudi Arabia, a Sunni monarchy, views as a proxy for its
regional rival, Iran. The Saudis point out that they, along with the
United Arab Emirates, are among the most generous donors to Yemen's
humanitarian relief effort. Last spring, the two allies pledged \$1
billion in aid to Yemen. In January, Saudi Arabia deposited \$2 billion
in Yemen's central bank to prop up its currency. But those efforts have
been overshadowed by the coalition's attacks on Yemen's economy,
including the denial of salaries to civil servants, a partial blockade
that has driven up food prices, and the printing of vast amounts of bank
notes, which caused the currency to plunge. And the offensive to capture
Hudaydah, which started in June, has endangered the main lifeline for
imports to northern Yemen, displaced 570,000 people and edged many more
closer to starvation. A famine here, Mr. Lowcock warned, would be "much
bigger than anything any professional in this field has seen during
their working lives." WHEN ALI HAJAJI'S SON FELL ILL with diarrhea and
vomiting, the desperate father turned to extreme measures. Following the
advice of village elders, he pushed the red-hot tip of a burning stick
into Shaher's chest, a folk remedy to drain the "black blood" from his
son. "People said burn him in the body and it will be O.K.," Mr. Hajaji
said. "When you have no money, and your son is sick, you'll believe
anything." The burns were a mark of the rudimentary nature of life in
Juberia, a cluster of mud-walled houses perched on a rocky ridge. To
reach it, you cross a landscape of sandy pastures, camels and beehives,
strewn with giant, rust-colored boulders, where women in black cloaks
and yellow straw boaters toil in the fields. In the past, the men of the
village worked as migrant laborers in Saudi Arabia, whose border is 80
miles away. They were often treated with disdain by their wealthy Saudi
employers but they earned a wage. Mr. Hajaji worked on a suburban
construction site in Mecca, the holy city visited by millions of Muslim
pilgrims every year. When the war broke out in 2015, the border closed.
The fighting never reached Juberia, but it still took a toll there. Last
year a young woman died of cholera, part of an epidemic that infected
1.1 million Yemenis. In April, a coalition airstrike hit a wedding party
in the district, killing 33 people, including the bride. A local boy who
went to fight for the Houthis was killed in an airstrike. Bassam
Mohammed Hassan, who suffers from severe malnutrition and cerebral
palsy, at a hospital in Sana, Yemen. "The big countries say they are
fighting each other in Yemen," Mr. Hajaji said. "But it feels to us like
they are fighting the poor people." Ahmed Ibrahim al-Junid, 5 months
old, in Aslam. But for Mr. Hajaji, who had five sons under age 7, the
deadliest blow was economic. He watched in dismay as the riyal lost half
its value in the past year, causing prices to soar. Suddenly, groceries
cost twice as much as they had before the war. Other villagers sold
their assets, such as camels or land, to get money for food. But Mr.
Hajaji, whose family lived in a one-room, mud-walled hut, had nothing to
sell. At first he relied on the generosity of neighbors. Then he pared
back the family diet, until it consisted only of bread, tea and halas, a
vine leaf that had always been a source of food but now occupied a
central place in every meal. Soon his first son to fall ill, Shaadi, was
vomiting and had diarrhea, classic symptoms of malnutrition. Mr. Hajaji
wanted to take the ailing 4-year-old to the hospital, but that was out
of the question: fuel prices had risen by 50 percent over the previous
year. One morning in late September, Mr. Hajaji walked into his house to
find Shaadi silent and immobile, with a yellow tinge to his skin. "I
knew he was gone," he said. He kissed his son on the forehead, bundled
him up in his arms, and walked along a winding hill path to the village
mosque. That evening, after prayers, the village gathered to bury
Shaadi. His grave, marked by a single broken rock, stood under a grove
of Sidr trees that, in better times, were famous for their honey. Shaadi
was the first in the village to die from hunger. A few weeks later, when
Shaher took ill, Mr. Hajaji was determined to do something. When burning
didn't work, he carried his son down the stony path to a health clinic,
which was ill-equipped for the task. Half of Yemen's health facilities
are closed because of the war. So his family borrowed \$16 for the
journey to the hospital in Hajjah. "All the big countries say they are
fighting each other in Yemen," Mr. Hajaji said. "But it feels to us like
they are fighting the poor people." YEMEN'S ECONOMIC CRISIS WAS not some
unfortunate but unavoidable side effect of the fighting. In 2016, the
Saudi-backed Yemeni government transferred the operations of the central
bank from the Houthi-controlled capital, Sana, to the southern city of
Aden. The bank, whose policies are dictated by Saudi Arabia, a senior
Western official said, started printing vast amounts of new money --- at
least 600 billion riyals, according to one bank official. The new money
caused an inflationary spiral that eroded the value of any savings
people had. The bank also stopped paying salaries to civil servants in
Houthi-controlled areas, where 80 percent of Yemenis live. With the
government as the largest employer, hundreds of thousands of families in
the north suddenly had no income. At the Sabeen hospital in Sana, Dr.
Huda Rajumi treats the country's most severely malnourished children.
But her own family is suffering, too, as she falls out of Yemen's
vanishing middle class. In the past year, she has received only a single
month's salary. Her husband, a retired soldier, is no longer getting his
pension, and Dr. Rajumi has started to skimp on everyday pleasures, like
fruit, meat and taxi rides, to make ends meet. "We get by because people
help each other out," she said. "But it's getting hard." Economic
warfare takes other forms, too. In a recent paper, Martha Mundy, a
lecturer at the London School of Economics, analyzed coalition
airstrikes in Yemen, finding that their attacks on bridges, factories,
fishing boats and even fields suggested that they aimed to destroy food
production and distribution in Houthi-controlled areas. [Airstrikes have
destroyed bridges, like this one in Bani Hassan, factories, fishing
boats and fields, suggesting that disrupting the food supply may have
been a goal.]{.underline} The fighting has displaced about a million
Yemenis. Airstrikes have destroyed homes in the Old City of Sana. Saudi
Arabia's tight control over all air and sea movements into northern
Yemen has effectively made the area a prison for those who live there.
In September, the World Health Organization brokered the establishment
of a humanitarian air bridge to allow the sickest Yemenis --- cancer
patients and others with life-threatening conditions --- to fly to
Egypt. Among those on the waiting list is Maimoona Naji, a 16-year-old
girl with a melon-size tumor on her left leg. At a hostel in Sana, her
father, Ali Naji, said they had obtained visas and money to travel to
India for emergency treatment. Their hopes soared in September when his
daughter was told she would be on the first plane out of Sana once the
airlift started. But the agreement has stalled, blocked by the Yemeni
government, according to the senior Western official. Maimoona and
dozens of other patients have been left stranded, the clock ticking on
their illnesses. "First they told us 'next week, next week,'" said Mr.
Naji, shuffling through reams of documents as tears welled up in his
eyes. "Then they said no. Where is the humanity in that? What did we do
to deserve this?" THE SAUDI COALITION IS NOT solely to blame for Yemen's
food crisis. In Houthi-held areas, aid workers say, commanders level
illegal taxes at checkpoints and frequently try to divert international
relief aid to the families of soldiers, or to line their own pockets. At
the United Nations on Tuesday, Mr. Lowcock, the humanitarian official,
said that aid workers in Yemen faced obstacles including delayed visas,
retracted work permits and interference in the work --- problems,
officials said privately, that were greatest in Houthi-held areas.
Despite the harrowing scenes of suffering in the north, some Yemenis are
getting rich. Upmarket parts of Sana are enjoying a mini real estate
boom, partly fueled by Yemeni migrants returned from Saudi Arabia, but
also by newly enriched Houthi officials. Local residents say they have
seen Houthi officials from modest backgrounds driving around the city in
Lexus four-wheel drives, or shopping in luxury stores, trailed by armed
gunmen, to buy suits and perfumes. Tensions reached a climax this summer
when the head of the United Nations migration agency was forced to leave
Sana after clashing with the Houthi administration. In an interview, the
Houthi vice foreign minister, Hussain al-Ezzi, denied reports of
corruption, and insisted that tensions with the United Nations had been
resolved. "We don't deny there have been some mistakes on our side," he
said. "We are working to improve them." "Nobody gives a damn about
them." Wadah Askri Mesheel, 11 months old, arrived at a clinic in Aslam,
Yemen, with severe malnutrition. He died eight hours later. In the
hushed hunger wards, ailing infants hover between life and death. [ONLY
TWO FAMINES HAVE BEEN OFFICIALLY DECLARED by the United Nations in the
past 20 years]{.underline}, in Somalia and South Sudan. [A United
Nations-led assessment]{.underline} due in mid-November [will determine
how close Yemen is to becoming the third.]{.underline} To stave it off,
aid workers are not appealing for shipments of relief aid but for urgent
measures to rescue the battered economy. "This is an income famine,"
said Lise Grande, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Yemen.
"The key to stopping it is to ensure that people have enough money to
buy what they need to survive." The priority should be to stabilize the
falling currency, she said, and to ensure that traders and shipping
companies can import the food that Yemenis need. Above all, she added,
["the fighting has to stop]{.underline}." One hope for Yemenis is that
the international fallout from the death of the Saudi dissident, Jamal
Khashoggi, which has damaged Prince Mohammed's international standing,
might force him to relent in his unyielding prosecution of the war.
Peter Salisbury, a Yemen specialist at Chatham House, said that was
unlikely. ["I think the Saudis have learned what they can get away with
in Yemen --- that western tolerance for pretty bad behavior is quite
high,]{.underline}" he said. "If the Khashoggi murder tells us anything,
it's just how reluctant people are to rein the Saudis in."

DOA: 6/9/19 GMDI

On Tuesday, a [House oversight committee]{.underline} released an
interim report [sounding alarms]{.underline} [about]{.underline} a
secretive [Trump administration]{.underline} [effort to
transfer]{.underline} sensitive [nuclear technology]{.underline} [to
Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. [The plan to help the kingdom build nuclear
power plants]{.underline} apparently dates from the early period of
Trump's presidency, before Congress soured on relations with Saudi
Arabia after Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi was
killed at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Yet the administration
apparently [discussed]{.underline} the plan [as recently as last
week]{.underline}, despite national security officials' objections. As
the oversight committee report makes clear, the Trump plan is highly
unusual. The United States and other countries that possess nuclear
technology have transferred it to nonnuclear countries for decades. But
that process, especially in the United States, is sensitive and closely
regulated. Here are three things to know about nuclear technology
transfer --- and what makes the Trump plan different. **1.** **The Trump
plan would circumvent a long-standing process that includes Congress**
Nuclear technology has both peaceful and military purposes; it can be
used to produce electricity or bombs. As Nobel-winning physicist Hannes
Alfvén once put it, the peaceful atom and the military atom are Siamese
twins. [Trade in nuclear technology can be dangerous because recipient
countries gain the foundation for a nuclear weapons
program.]{.underline} Nuclear suppliers regulate the nuclear marketplace
accordingly. In the United States, the process typically starts when
presidents or other senior officials push for nuclear exports, despite
their security risks, because they generate revenue for U.S. companies
and may help Washington gain political influence with the receiving
country. For example, then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger [advocated
for nuclear
assistance](https://books.google.com/books?id=WHXfP25eMq4C&pg=PA84&lpg=PA84&dq=kissinger+%22attach+highest+value+to+a+partnership+with+iran%22&source=bl&ots=QJhykFk92h&sig=ACfU3U3Wv8eGJaJ_Dl7zRuyh2VWLByo7ag&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiLhcT6gcvgAhVCWq0KHXNlBLQQ6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&q=kissinger%20%22attach%20highest%20value%20to%20a%20partnership%20with%20iran%22&f=false)
to Iran in 1974 --- when Washington and Tehran were allies --- because
he believed this would provide "concrete evidence of our ... interest in
developing closer ties" and show that we "attach highest value to a
partnership" with Iran. In the next step, U.S. diplomats negotiate a
nuclear cooperation agreement (NCA) with their foreign counterparts.
NCAs usually require the importing state to guarantee that it will use
technology and materials only for peaceful purposes, and will accept
international safeguards to verify compliance with this pledge.
According to [Section 123 of the 1954 Atomic Energy
Act](https://www.oecd-nea.org/law/nlbfr/documents/087_090_USAtomicEnergyAct.pdf),
the diplomats' finalized agreement must be submitted to the president,
who must then send it to Congress. Without congressional approval of
what's commonly called a "123 Agreement," U.S. firms are not authorized
to export nuclear technology. The United States has about [two dozen 123
Agreements in force](https://www.state.gov/t/isn/rls/fs/2017/266975.htm)
with countries that include Canada, Egypt, Japan and the United Arab
Emirates --- but not Saudi Arabia. The Trump administration has publicly
[expressed a
desire](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2018-04/news/us-saudi-talks-begin-nuclear-pact)
to conclude such a deal. Selling nuclear technology to Riyadh before
Congress signed off on a 123 Agreement would be illegal. According to
the House committee report, U.S. officials pushing for nuclear
cooperation with Saudi Arabia have [ignored the legal requirement for
congressional
approval](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/us/politics/trump-saudi-arabia-nuclear-power.html).
**2.** **[The risk of nuclear weapons proliferation is high in the Saudi
case]{.underline}** [Does selling peaceful nuclear technology lead to
the proliferation of nuclear weapons]{.underline}? Researchers disagree.
According to [one
view](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1148025?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents),
[helping]{.underline} other [countries develop peaceful nuclear programs
increases the risk]{.underline} that [they will]{.underline} ultimately
[pursue]{.underline} and obtain [nuclear bombs]{.underline}. That's what
[my own
research](http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100285320)
[has
found](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/isec.2009.34.1.7)
--- [especially when]{.underline}, after receiving the nuclear
technology, materials, and know-how, [the]{.underline} recipient
[country finds itself in a military conflict]{.underline}. [By reducing
the barriers to bombmaking]{.underline}, [foreign nuclear aid makes
nuclear proliferation less costly and]{.underline} [therefore more
likely]{.underline}. For example, [after Canada and the United States
gave India]{.underline} [nuclear technology]{.underline} and materials
in the 1950s, [India fought wars with China and Pakistan]{.underline}
over disputed borders --- [and then used that assistance to build and
test a nuclear explosive device]{.underline} in 1974. Iraq's Saddam
Hussein probably intended to use a French-supplied reactor for the same
purpose before Israel [destroyed it in a 1981
attack](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/ISEC_a_00046?casa_token=JNutXSpwDMgAAAAA%3AujfE5g4Cme84NM0iJ-mivbG2OfWVpCTi5iIgMCR0BcX6ih0s0Fa8elMVoU1y1jZRz7iwJ6p3PdFp&).
And before J. Wynand de Villiers headed South Africa's nuclear explosive
program, the [United States trained

in "peaceful" nuclear energy. [Other
scholars](http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100902890)
[dispute](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09636412.2011.549013)
[the
notion](http://stanford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.11126/stanford/9780804784177.001.0001/upso-9780804784177-chapter-8)
that peaceful nuclear assistance leads to nuclear weapons proliferation.
Researcher Nicholas Miller, for instance,
[argues](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/ISEC_a_00293) that
investments in nuclear energy make countries more
[vulnerable](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/ISEC_a_00293)
to economic sanctions, since those would withhold the materials needed
to produce electricity --- and so might be less willing to risk building
bombs. Since nuclear assistance brings factors that push nations both
toward and away from building nuclear weapons, he contends, the net
effect is neutral. Certainly, several countries --- Belgium, Mexico, the
Netherlands and others --- have developed nuclear energy programs
without seriously pursuing nuclear weapons. And researchers Matthew
Kroenig and Alexander Montgomery show that peaceful nuclear assistance
does not make weapons proliferation statistically more likely; it may
actually decrease this danger. So how would Saudi Arabia respond to
nuclear assistance? With its vast oil and natural gas reserves, [Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}'s immediate need for nuclear power is not critical.
But it [is in a dangerous neighborhood and has already waged proxy wars
with Iran]{.underline} [and other regional rivals]{.underline} --- and
will likely have such conflicts again. If my research is correct, [that
combination of security threats and nuclear assistance]{.underline}
would [give]{.underline} the [Saudis]{.underline} both [the will and
opportunity to build a nuclear arsenal.]{.underline} International
safeguards would make it more difficult for Saudi Arabia to use its
nuclear knowledge and supplies into weapons. But a Saudi Arabia with a
well-developed peaceful nuclear program is probably more likely to
behave like Iraq or India than Belgium or the Netherlands.

### Prolif AO 

#### Arms deal will lead to massive Saudi proliferation and nuclear war

**Cunningham 19** \[Finian Cunningham is an award-winning journalist who
has written extensively on international affairs. "Trump accuses Iran
over nukes, all the while risking Saudi regime acquiring the bomb" RT --

GMDI\]

[The Trump administration appears to be on a reckless path of sharing
sensitive nuclear technology with Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, [which
could lead to this]{.underline} notorious [regime acquiring weapons of
mass destruction]{.underline}. This is while President Trump has been
assailing Iran with military threats, over claims that Tehran is
secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons. The duplicity is staggering.
[The Trump administration]{.underline} is posing as a policeman in the
Middle East purportedly to prevent nuclear proliferation. In reality,
[it is fueling a potential nuclear arms race and heightening the danger
of war.]{.underline} It is no secret that Saudi Arabia has ambitions to
build nuclear power plants to meet its civilian energy and water needs
as the future of its oil wealth faces strategic challenges. The US and
several other international players, including Russia and South Korea,
are vying for the contracts to build these multi-billion-dollar power
stations. It is now emerging that the [Trump]{.underline} administration
[has been pushing ahead with licenses to its nuclear companies to share
sensitive technology with the Saudis]{.underline}. What is alarming is
that the White House has been doing so in a secretive manner, which
overrides Congressional oversight rules based on national security
protocols. A further cause for concern is the [Trump administration
appears to be giving the Saudis nuclear knowhow that could lead to the
weaponization of technology]{.underline}. For their part, the Saudis
have pushed back on standards ensuring that civilian energy applications
are kept strictly separated from weapons programs. Disturbingly, the
Trump administration does not seem bothered by the ambiguity. It is
forging ahead with licensing the technology to the Saudi rulers. [Saudi
Arabia's]{.underline} impetuous [Crown Prince]{.underline} Mohammed bin
Salman (MbS) last year [told US media that his country would race to
obtain nuclear weapons]{.underline} "if" Iran were to do so. Given that
MbS is close to the Trump administration and to the Israelis in terms of
viewing Iran as an arch-enemy, it can be fairly assumed that the Saudi
rulers already believe that Tehran is secretly pursuing a nuclear
weapons program. Iran has consistently rejected claims that it is
building nuclear weapons. Its compliance with the 2015 international
nuclear accord banning any such application has been verified in more
than a dozen reports by UN inspectors from the International Atomic
Energy Agency. But that hasn't stopped the Israelis and Trump
administration continually asserting the opposite. That, in turn,
probably means that [the Saudi rulers have decided to go for making the
bomb]{.underline}. [There are several other reasons to fear a nuclear
arms race is on the way in the Middle East.]{.underline} The Trump White
House has been enabling the sharing of sensitive nuclear technology with
Saudi Arabia despite mounting criticism of the kingdom's human rights
record. That record was always notoriously grim but during the Trump
administration, it has plumbed new depths. The horrendous Saudi air war
on Yemen and its death toll among civilians has prompted the US Congress
to ban weapons sales. But just last month, Trump bypassed the
restriction by declaring a multi-billion-dollar arms sale to Saudi
Arabia, because it was "an emergency" allegedly owing to a regional
security threat from Iran. Even more galling are reports that the White
House approved of the nuclear technology transfers in the weeks and
months after the journalist Jamal Khashoggi was brutally murdered in the
Saudi consulate in Istanbul last October. That is in spite of the
American CIA then concluding Crown Prince MbS was complicit in the
killing. If none of these harrowing concerns have paused the Trump
administration's indulgence of the Saudi regime, then the latter is
entitled to think it has a blank cheque to do anything it wants,
including acquiring nuclear weapons. President Trump's enabling of the
Saudis to get the bomb is, of course, fraught with illegalities. It
would be a gross violation of the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
which bans nuclear powers from spreading access to such weapons. There
is also the issue of American law. The Trump administration seems to be
blindsiding Congress in its murky dealings with the Saudis, in breach of
the Atomic Energy Act, which mandates the president to keep lawmakers
informed of any international nuclear cooperation. Trump's feckless
regard for nuclear proliferation and arms controls should not be
surprising, however. This administration unilaterally trashed the Iran
nuclear deal last year, and it has walked away from the 1987
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty with Russia. Russian President
Vladimir Putin said last week that the Trump administration appears
ready to also let a second major arms control treaty, New START,
collapse. So, despite Trump's expressed desire to get rid of nuclear
weapons on a global scale, all the indicators suggest that he has a
reprehensible disregard for inciting arms races. There is founded alarm
among US lawmakers from both parties that [Saudi Arabia is on the path
towards obtaining nuclear weapons]{.underline}. [Recent reports indicate
it has expanded its ballistic missiles capability]{.underline} with
technology transfers from China[. If confirmed, then the next step could
be to fit these missiles with nuclear warheads.]{.underline} The
[Trump]{.underline} administration [appears to be paving the way for the
Saudi regime to achieve that.]{.underline} President Trump's
incorrigible kowtowing towards the Saudi royal family has raised
suspicions that he is looking beyond his presidential office to future
years of expanding the Trump family business empire in the Middle East.
His sycophancy towards the Saudis transcends so many boundaries of
decency and basic morals. There are two other possible motives. Trump
and his son-in-law Jared Kushner want to go down in history for their
"Deal of the Century" settling the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The
overrated and overdue "deal" is seen as a grubby sell-out of Palestinian
rights. But to get acceptance in the wider Arab world, Trump and Kushner
need the Saudis to give it a stamp of approval. That could be one factor
in why the Trump White House may be soliciting the Saudis with the "big
bomb prize". Another motive is Trump using the Saudis and their visceral
hatred of Shia Iran as the ultimate "pressure tool" on Tehran. If the
Iranians see the Wahhabi potentates getting nuclear weapons, Trump may
be calculating that it will bring Iran to the negotiating table and make
strategic concessions, as he has long been pushing for. There again[,
Iran may]{.underline} go another way. It may repudiate its long-standing
disavowal of nuclear weapons and [determine that it has no choice but to
also build the bomb to avert an existential threat from the Saudi
regime.]{.underline} Either way, it all makes a mockery of the Trump
White House's pretensions for peace and security in the region. [This
administration is criminally fueling a]{.underline} potentially
[catastrophic war.]{.underline}

#### Saudi prolif risks regional nuclear war and WMD terrorism- it's rapid

Wall Street Journal, "Saudi Arabia Considers Nuclear Weapons to Offset

[The nuclear deal]{.underline} that the U.S. and other world powers hope
to reach [with Iran would put a 10-year curb on the Islamic republic's
nuclear program.]{.underline} For some of Iran's regional rivals, [that
is also becoming a deadline for developing nuclear arms of their
own]{.underline}. [In Saudi Arabia, there are widespread public calls to
match Iran's nuclear quest]{.underline}. The two other Middle East
heavyweights, Turkey and Egypt, could also feel compelled to follow
suit, senior Western and Arab officials warn. **[Such an arms race would
further destabilize what is already the world's most volatile region,
where the risks of a nuclear war would be compounded by the threat of
radioactive material falling into the hands of terrorist
groups]{.underline}**. While [Saudi]{.underline} Arabia has long
advocated a nuclear-free Middle East, its [leaders are doubtful that
the]{.underline} completed [accord on limiting Tehran's nuclear program
will stop Iran from becoming a threshold nuclear-weapons
power]{.underline} when proposed restrictions on is number of
centrifuges and uranium stockpiles expire in 10 years. They also aren't
willing to bet that the regime in Tehran will somehow become more
moderate and responsible by then, a hope entertained by many in the
West. "We prefer a region without nuclear weapons. But [if Iran does it,
**nothing can prevent us from doing it too, not even the international
community**]{.underline}," said Abdullah al Askar, a member and former
chairman of the foreign affairs committee of Saudi Arabia's advisory
legislature. "[Our leaders will never allow Iran to have a nuclear
weapon while we don't,]{.underline}" added Ibrahim al-Marie, a retired
Saudi colonel and a security analyst in Riyadh. "[If Iran declares a
nuclear weapon, we can't afford to wait 30 years more for our
own]{.underline}---we should be able to declare ours within a week."
Part of the reason for this sense of urgency is that Saudi Arabia and
its Sunni Arab allies are increasingly battling mainly Shiite Iran in
proxy conflicts across the region, from Syria to Yemen. Besides their
fears of a nuclear Iran dominating the Middle East one day, [they are
fretting that the agreement would dramatically tilt the regional balance
of power in Tehran's favor already in the immediate future]{.underline},
especially once the removal of international sanctions revitalizes the
Iranian economy and gives it access to more than \$100 billion in frozen
overseas assets. They also increasingly distrust the U.S., the
traditional guarantor of Gulf security. "Our allies aren't listening to
us, and this is what is making us extremely nervous," said Prince Faisal
bin Saud bin Abdulmohsen, a scholar at the King Faisal Center for
Research and Islamic Studies in the Saudi capital. "If I am basing my
judgment on the track record and our experience with Iran, I will say
they will do anything in their power to get a nuclear weapon. A delay of
10 years is not going to satiate anything," Prince Faisal said. "[Should
Iran gain the ability to produce weapons-grade uranium and ability to
deploy such weapons," developing a Saudi capability in response "would
be considered as part of our homeland security]{.underline}," he added.
Iran claims it doesn't seek nuclear weapons. The
[Obama](http://topics.wsj.com/person/O/Obama/4328) administration has
long argued that the nuclear deal would make it unnecessary for
countries like Saudi Arabia to embark on their own nuclear programs.
U.S. officials also say that the alternative to this agreement is either
war, with unpredictable consequences for the region, or an even faster
development of an Iranian nuclear bomb accompanied by a likely collapse
of the international sanctions regime. Among other worlds powers
currently in talks with Iran, Russia has always been more sympathetic to
Tehran, while France shares many of Saudi Arabia's concerns, one reason
that President François Hollande was the guest of honor at a summit of
Gulf leaders in Riyadh this week. The kingdom's former intelligence
chief and ex-ambassador to Washington, Prince Turki al Faisal, set off
the current nuclear debate by declaring in March that whatever Iran gets
in Geneva, "we will want the same." [King Salman returned to this
issue]{.underline} in a speech at this week's Riyadh summit, [warning
that a nuclear deal without adequate safeguards---something the Saudis
feel is the case with the current draft agreement---risks "plunging the
region into an arms race."]{.underline} The Saudi king and other Gulf
monarchs are slated to discuss these concerns and their request for more
robust U.S. security guarantees against Iran at a meeting with President
Barack Obama at Camp David next week. Secretary of State [John
Kerry](http://topics.wsj.com/person/K/John-Kerry/7196) visited Riyadh on
Wednesday and Thursday for talks with Saudi and other Gulf officials,
part of the U.S. push to reach out to Riyadh on the issue. The
possibility that the nuclear agreement with Iran could set off a nuclear
race in the region has long been a serious U.S. concern, said R.
Nicholas Burns, who led U.S. negotiations on the nuclear program with
Iran and served as the highest-ranking career diplomat at the State
Department before retiring in 2008.

#### Arms sales embolden Saudi Arabia and the UAE in Sudan -- leading to further massacres and destruction -- decks democracy

Since the Arab uprisings of 2011, [Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates have used their considerable resources to promote authoritarian
governments]{.underline} run by military strongmen in the region. They
helped crush Bahrain's uprising, bankrolled a return to military
dictatorship in Egypt, armed a rogue military leader in Libya and
mismanaged a democratic transition in Yemen before launching a
destructive war there. [A]{.underline} ghastly [new chapter in the Saudi
and the Emirati counterrevolution against democratic movements in the
region is unfolding in Sudan]{.underline}, [whose generals have
unleashed terrible violence on supporters of democracy.]{.underline} On
the morning of June 3, [Sudanese armed forces attacked sit-ins in the
capital]{.underline}, Khartoum, and elsewhere, [killing more than 100
people]{.underline} and injuring over 500. Even though [the internet has
been]{.underline} largely [blocked]{.underline}, reports and videos have
trickled out: bloodied protesters being carried away to makeshift
first-aid stations; heartbreaking accounts of gang rapes of doctors;
disfigured bodies of protesters pulled out of the Nile; protesters
burned in their sit-in tents. The two men ultimately responsible for the
troops who committed these atrocities are Lt. Gen. Abdel Fattah
al-Burhan and Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, known as Hemeti, who are heading
the Transitional Military Council that replaced the ousted longtime
president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir. [General Hamdan leads the Rapid
Support Forces]{.underline}, [the paramilitary force created by
rebranding the janjaweed militias that conducted the genocide in
Darfur.]{.underline} The crackdown came after weeks of negotiations
between protest leaders and the military council reached an impasse. The
protest leaders wanted the military to immediately hand over power to
civilians; the council insisted on military rule until elections,
promised to be held within nine months. Protesters feared that elections
under the military council would neither be free nor fair, but simply a
cover to legitimize the appointment of a new military dictator ---
essentially repeating what happened in Egypt in 2014 when Field Marshal
Abdel Fattah el-Sisi won by 97 percent. Mr. el-Sisi rose to power after
the Egyptian Army killed up to 1,000 largely unarmed protesters at a
sit-in at Rabaa Square in Cairo in 2013. Parallels to Egypt were not
lost on the Sudanese protesters, who had been chanting, "Either victory
or Egypt." [Sudan's democracy advocates also feared that]{.underline}
the very forces that catapulted Mr. el-Sisi to power in [Egypt would be
pulling the strings in Sudan]{.underline}. Before and after the Rabaa
massacre, [Egypt received diplomatic support and billions of dollars of
financial assistance from]{.underline} two wealthy Arab monarchies:
[Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.]{.underline} General
al-Burhan [and General Hamdan have had a close working relationship with
the Saudi and Emirati leadership]{.underline} since at least 2015[,
having been directly involved in the Saudi-led war on
Yemen]{.underline}. General al-Burhan has been overseeing Sudan's more
than 10,000 ground troops in Yemen. These troops include thousands of
militiamen from the Rapid Security Forces headed by General Hamdan. When
Mr. al-Bashir was besieged by popular protests in early April, Sudanese
military leaders thought it was time to sideline him. [A delegation
traveled to Cairo to secure political and financial support from Egypt,
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates,]{.underline} which
disapproved of Mr. al-Bashir's ties to Islamists and his outreach to
Turkey and Qatar. [Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates
followed up by reaching out to]{.underline} General al-Burhan and
[General Hamdan]{.underline}. [After the Transitional Military Council
assumed power, the Saudis and the Emiratis made their influence soon
felt]{.underline}: On April 21, [they approved \$3 billion in aid to
Sudan, in a bid to strengthen the council]{.underline}. Yet in the weeks
after, protesters continued to increase the pressure, as the number at
sit-in camps swelled even as tense negotiations continued. In late May,
[General Hamdan met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi
Arabia and reaffirmed his commitment to a close alliance with the
kingdom]{.underline}. General al-Burhan met Mr. el-Sisi in Cairo and the
United Arab Emirates' de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Zayed, in Abu Dhabi.
They seemed to return home emboldened: They declared the breakdown of
negotiations with the Sudanese opposition, rejected calls to hand over
power, declared the sit-in camps to be "a threat to the national
security of the state," and banned Al Jazeera from reporting in Sudan.
[Then came the June 3 attack on the protesters]{.underline}, which
carried echoes of the assault on Bahrain's Pearl Square protest camp in
2011 and the Egyptian massacre. [Videos uploaded]{.underline} on social
media [by citizen journalists clearly showed Emirati-manufactured
military gear deployed by Sudanese militias]{.underline}. Influential
[Saudi-controlled accounts]{.underline} on Twitter [expressed their
support for Sudan's military leaders]{.underline} and warned against the
"folly" of popular uprising. [The Saudi and Emirati reactionary role in
Sudan and their influence over the Transitional Military Council's
actions was highlighted by the reaction from the United
States]{.underline}. After the killings, the under secretary of state
for political affairs, David Hale, called the Saudi deputy defense
minister Khalid bin Salman and the United Arab Emirates' foreign
minister, Anwar Gargash, to express concern over the crackdown and to
note "the importance of a transition to a civilian-led government in
accordance with the will of the Sudanese people." Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates claim that their interventions have been aimed at
staving off Islamist extremism and promoting regional stability. But
Sudan's uprising against Mr. al-Bashir is an uprising against political
Islamists; the protest leaders who have been negotiating with the
military council are not Islamists. [Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates are instead driven by their own fear that should a major Arab
country transition to democracy, it would lead to upheavals at
home.]{.underline} With Sudan's Arab neighbors under Saudi and Emirati
sway, [with the United States doing little beyond expressing
concern]{.underline}, it has fallen to Ethiopia's prime minister, Abiy
Ahmed, to take the lead in mediation between the military council and
the opposition. And outraged at the killings in Sudan, the African Union
has suspended Sudan's membership and called for a civilian-led
transitional government. But as long as the military junta has political
and financial support from the Saudis and the Emiratis, it will have
little reason to back down. The protest leaders continue to be committed
to nonviolence despite another round of attacks by the Sudanese forces
on Sunday to thwart a general strike. Sudan's opposition is embattled,
hurting but defiant.

At dawn on Monday, June 3, [paramilitary forces raided the sit-in
opposite the Army General Command in Khartoum, Sudan, raining fire on
protesters]{.underline} and bringing an end to six months of a largely
peaceful uprising. [Soldiers]{.underline} broke through the
demonstrators' barricades, [burnt their tents to the ground, and shot at
and beat protesters]{.underline}. Witnesses spoke of soldiers shooting
indiscriminately, throwing bodies of slain protesters into the Nile, and
raping two of the medics at the sit-in. [Within forty-eight hours, the
death toll rose to over a hundred,]{.underline} as tens of bodies were
recovered from the Nile. Five hundred more were injured in what could
only be described as a premeditated massacre. The sit-in outside the
military headquarters had become the focal point of the ongoing Sudanese
Revolution, with students and professionals having camped out to protest
the ruling military regime since early April. Led by the Sudanese
Professionals Association, an umbrella group of trade unions that had
previously been banned by the regime, the uprising maintained a
nonviolent and highly organized character, culminating in a two-day
general strike at the end of May. The aim of last week's early-morning
massacre and the ensuing crackdown is clear: [to disperse the
revolutionaries, end the central sit-in, and crush the people's demand
to wrest power from the military.]{.underline} But two months after the
initial protests that ousted dictator Omar al-Bashir, the
revolutionaries were still voicing their same principal demand: an end
to military rule in Sudan and a civilian-led transition government that
could lead the way to fair and democratic elections. Weeks of
negotiations with the military had stalemated, with the military
refusing to relinquish control. Last Monday's attack was led by the
[Rapid Support Forces (RSF)]{.underline}, a state-controlled offshoot of
the Janjaweed, a militia responsible for war crimes in Darfur. After
storming and brutally massacring demonstrators in Khartoum's sit-in, the
[RSF]{.underline} then moved to the surrounding neighborhoods --- which
had also boasted anti-regime protests and ongoing congregations of
demonstrators [--- continuing to disperse, beat, and shoot
activists.]{.underline} Mohammed, a resident of one of the surrounding
neighborhoods, described the scene he witnessed early that morning and
the continued crackdown: The RSF came first in a small band, around
three or four trucks, and they started talking to the army. We thought
that maybe the army --- they were lower-ranked soldiers --- would be on
our side. But the RSF drove through the barricades that we had built,
and the army didn't do anything. Shortly afterwards, the army vehicles
that were in our neighborhood left. At that point most people understood
what was going to come next, and started to clear out. We realized that
the army and the RSF were in coordination with each other --- and that
the RSF were completely in control. They started shooting at us and we
all started running away from the barricades, and running into houses to
hide. I haven't been brave enough to go outside to rebuild the
barricades like some other people have been since then. It's terrifying.
[There's gunshots everywhere]{.underline}. [In my neighborhood there is
reports of a sniper in an abandoned building.]{.underline} I don't know
where specifically so it's really risky[. They want to terrorize us at
home. The RSF also raided three of Khartoum's hospitals, shooting at
wounded protesters]{.underline} who had been brought in for treatment.
At Sudan's Royal Care Hospital last Tuesday, [the soldiers forced fifty
wounded protesters to evacuate after shooting and arresting one of the
doctors]{.underline}, who had been a part of the medical team at the
sit-in. [Other revolutionary sit-ins in various cities]{.underline}
across the country, including in northern Port Sudan, and in eastern
Gadarif and Sinja, [were also raided and attacked by the
RSF]{.underline}. In a further show of force and lockdown, [the military
imposed an internet blackout, crippling most online and phone services
across the country]{.underline}. The internet blackout is still ongoing.
And [Khartoum,]{.underline} as activists have explained[, is essentially
under military occupation.]{.underline} The aim of last week's
early-morning massacre and the ensuing crackdown is clear: to disperse
the revolutionaries, end the central sit-in, and crush the people's
demand to wrest power from the military. The brutal crackdown comes six
years after the Rab'aa massacre in Cairo carried out by then-general,
now-president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, where over a thousand Muslim
Brotherhood protesters were slaughtered, capping the coup carried out by
the Egyptian military and marking a sharper turn of counterrevolution in
the country. Today, the Khartoum sit-in massacre marks a
counterrevolutionary turning point in Sudan, though in Sudan it is the
regime associated with the Muslim Brotherhood that perpetrated the
killings. The forces of counterrevolution in Sudan are outgrowths of the
country's own recent history of genocidal war. As many commentators said
of the [RSF's]{.underline} brutal crackdown, Darfur has come to Khartoum
this week. Indeed, the Rapid Support Forces [have a nearly two-decade
history of racist repression in Darfur in western Sudan, as well as
collusion with the European Union's drive to eliminate migration across
its borders.]{.underline}

[The thorny question of Saudi Arabian political influence across the
Middle East and Africa]{.underline} [is back in the spotlight again with
Washington]{.underline} taking the unusual step of [effectively telling
Riyadh to end Sudan's military crackdown.]{.underline} In an unusual
public statement the [US state department revealed that]{.underline} its
undersecretary for political affairs, the diplomat [David
Hale]{.underline}, [had phoned the Saudi deputy defence
minister]{.underline}, Khaled bin Salman, [to ask him to use the
country's influence to end the brutal repression]{.underline} against
peaceful protesters [by the Sudanese Transitional Military Council (TMC)
in Sudan]{.underline}. [It has hardly been a secret that Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates have gained influence in Sudan]{.underline}
following the overthrow of the dictator Omar al-Bashir in April. Critics
of Saudi Arabia will see a pattern of behaviour, evident in Libya and
Yemen, in which Saudi Arabia moves to marginalise rivals Iran and Qatar,
as well as to install autocratic regimes built on repression. But it is
rare for the Americans, normally so close to Saudi Arabia on regional
issues, to make so public their representations to Riyadh on the need
for civilian rule and for democracy to run its course. Saudi Arabia may
claim the Sudanese crackdown was an independent judgment by the interim
leader, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, but the army general has in recent weeks
paid visits to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt. More importantly the
deputy president of the council, Mohamed Hamdan Dagolo, the Rapid
Support Forces (RSF) militia leader known as Hemedti, met the Saudi
crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, in Jeddah on 24 May, and pledged to
stand with the kingdom against all threats, including Iran. He vowed
Sudanese troops would continue fighting alongside Saudi Arabia against
the Houthi rebels in Yemen. Dagolo is widely seen as the true
decision-maker in Khartoum, and the figure behind moves to stall
negotiations about the transition to democracy and resist protesters'
demands that they be included in the transitional body. That Dagolo
chose Riyadh for his first overseas trip since the fall of Bashir was
hardly surprising. In April Saudi Arabia pledged to provide \$3bn in
funds to Khartoum, a move designed to stabilise the exchange rate and
strengthen the military. [Until recently there was no sign that the US
disapproved of its great ally gaining influence in Sudan]{.underline}.
The US made no complaint when, on 30 May, Sudanese security officers
notified al-Jazeera's office in Khartoum saying the military council had
decided to withdraw the Qatari state-owned TV network's work permits
without providing an official reason. The shutdown came as the
authorities began a clampdown against a protest camp in the capital.
[But the scale of the bloody assault on the Khartoum protesters this
week led to a change in tone in Washington, and an irritation if not
exasperation with Saudi foreign policy.]{.underline} The US national
security adviser, John Bolton, tweeted: "The unprovoked violence of
Sudan's security forces against peaceful demonstrators in Khartoum is
abhorrent. The TMC must respect the right to peaceful demonstration and
speed transition to a civilian-led government, which the Sudanese people
have rightfully demanded." The tweet was followed by the publicised call
between Hale and bin Salman. [Yet the involvement of Saudi and the UAE,
the leading Sunni "counter revolutionary" states, is part of a wider
pattern of jostling for influence across the mainly Muslim Horn of
Africa.]{.underline} Between 2000 and 2017, Gulf states invested \$13bn
in the region, mainly in Sudan and Ethiopia, according to a study by the
Clingendael Institute, a thinktank in the Netherlands. Broadly, on one
side lies Qatar and Turkey, and on the other the counter-revolutionary
states opposed to Islamism. At stake is the capture of strategic ports,
improved maritime security, and privileged access to the rapidly
emerging economies. Saudi has been particularly active across the Horn
of Africa and instrumental last autumn in negotiating a peace treaty
between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia's prime minister, was
given \$3bn in aid and investments from the UAE upon taking office in
April 2018, including a \$1bn deposit in the country's central bank. In
Yemen again it is the UAE and Saudi Arabia that head a coalition that
has led to a four-year civil war aimed at reinstalling Abd-Rabbu Mansour
Hadi, as leader. Hadi spends most of his time in Riyadh and is no poster
boy for democracy but Saudi will not abandon the war, regardless of the
casualties, because it regards Iranian-backed Houthis as a permanent
security threat. Equally in Libya, where a bloody military stalemate
persists in Tripoli, Marshall Khalifa Haftar by most accounts would not
have tried to seize the capital in defiance of a UN peace plan without
UAE military hardware, and Saudi political backing. [The question now is
whether in Sudan, unlike Libya and Yemen, the US government is prepared
to do more than simply dial Riyadh once.]{.underline}

It is probably no coincidence that the sudden, violent crackdown on
protesters in central Khartoum followed a series of meetings between the
leaders of Sudan's military junta and autocratic Arab regimes that are
actively attempting to shape the country's future. [Analysts say the
rulers of Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, no friends to democratic
governance, are acting in concert to thwart the aspirations of Sudan's
reform movement.]{.underline} All three tried to shore up Omar
al-Bashir's regime, and since he was toppled in April by popular
protests they have conspired to foment a counter-revolution. [This
fateful turning point may now have arrived.]{.underline} For Egypt's
president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, the Khartoum violence brings back old
memories. In 2013, Sisi, then an army general, led the assaults on
pro-democracy demonstrators in Cairo's public squares, resulting in
hundreds of deaths and injuries. Sisi's intervention crushed the Arab
spring in Egypt. Mass detentions, executions and de facto dictatorship
ensued. Notwithstanding the Khartoum killings, nothing on that scale has
yet occurred in Sudan. But tolerance for months of non-violent public
protest ended abruptly on Monday. A visit to Egypt by Gen Abdel Fattah
al-Burhan, the head of Sudan's junta, which is officially called the
transitional military council, went ahead after talks with the
opposition on forming a new administration broke down at the end of last
month. Although Sisi has publicly pledged to honour the "will of the
Sudanese people", he values a stable, pliable Sudan helping to fight
Islamists. He may also hope for Sudanese concessions on border and Nile
water disputes in return for backing the generals. Egypt has already
given the junta significant assistance, using its regional influence to
rally support. The African Union, which Egypt currently chairs, set a
15-day deadline for the military to hand over power when Bashir fell.
After Sisi intervened, the deadline was extended to three months. Burhan
and his deputy, Gen Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, have also
been shoring up support in the Gulf. After Cairo, Burhan went to the UAE
which, along with Saudi Arabia, has promised \$3bn in aid since the
security forces seized power. The powerful Emirati crown prince,
Mohammed bin Zayed, vowed to help Burhan "preserve Sudan's security and
stability". Dagalo, head of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces that
reportedly spearheaded Monday's crackdown, meanwhile went to Jeddah to
meet Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince who gained
international notoriety after last year's murder of Jamal Khashoggi.
[Sudan's military already had strong ties to the Gulf monarchies, having
assisted in the Saudi-UAE war in Yemen.]{.underline} "Sudan stands with
the kingdom against all threats and attacks from Iran and the Houthis,"
Dagalo said after the meeting. [Sudan's pro-democracy movement and civil
society activists have deplored all this fraternal back-slapping,
viewing its as foreign meddling in Sudan's sovereign affairs. But
familiar power dynamics are working against them.]{.underline} The
generals rightly fear a reckoning should they bow to the opposition's
demand for majority control over any transitional military-civilian
government[. Regional Arab states want to be able to influence Sudan's
future policy]{.underline}, especially on security issues, terrorism and
Iran. In this respect, the interests of both coincide with those of the
Trump administration. [Washington has been missing in combat as the
Sudan crisis has unfolded]{.underline}. [It has publicly urged dialogue.
But the western world's leading democracy has shown zero interest in
actively supporting Sudan's passionately sought democratic
renaissance]{.underline}. Donald [Trump seems content to let his
autocratic Saudi and UAE allies take the policy lead]{.underline}.
Similar considerations inform American attitudes to the conflict in
Libya, where Trump has favoured the Gulf Arabs' choice of a "strongman"
leader over the UN-backed government. Where is Britain, the former
colonial power, in Sudan's hour of need? Irfan Siddiq, the UK ambassador
to Khartoum, has energetically lobbied for a peaceful, negotiated
settlement. He is very active on Twitter. But the British government as
a whole appears uncaring and unengaged.

[Arms embargos are often dismissed as symbolic, and therefore
ineffective]{.underline}. But [just because something is symbolic,
doesn't mean that it won't have an effect]{.underline}. A [U.S. arms
embargo against Saudi Arabia **would be a clear signal** **of American
disproval** of Saudi actions in Yemen, and would be an **equally
important signal to Washington's allies**]{.underline}, [who are left
wondering if the United States is ambivalent or uninterested in the
growing Yemeni humanitarian catastrophe.]{.underline} [By continuing to
provide weapons, President Donald Trump tacitly endorses Saudi
policies.]{.underline} This signal is strengthened by Trump's recent
veto of the resolution that called for an end to U.S. support for the
war in Yemen. While Trump justified the veto by saying that the
resolution was a "dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional
authorities," statements from Congressional representatives show they
are aware of the powerful signals sent by arms sales. Sen. Tim Kaine
said that the veto "shows the world \[Trump\] is determined to keep
aiding a Saudi-backed war that has killed thousands of civilians and
pushed millions more to the brink of starvation." [An arms embargo
against Saudi Arabia would be a signal both to leaders of that country,
and other states, that the United States does not endorse Saudi
actions]{.underline}. [Those arguing against a ban are correct on one
point: Embargos as blunt force instruments of coercion are rarely
effective. But arms embargos are effective **as signals of political
dissatisfaction**, and serve an **important communication role** in
international politics. **Arms Embargos Are Signals and Can Build
Coalitions**]{.underline} Policymakers and scholars agree that arms
embargoes are not effective "sticks" in international politics. Rarely
do states cave when faced with punishment in the form of an embargo. But
even if an arms embargo isn't a direct tool of coercion, an embargo
would be an important political signal. There are at least two reasons
for the United States to seriously consider an arms embargo against
Saudi Arabia. [First, arms sales are signals that cut through the noise
of the international system]{.underline}. [Cutting off arms transfers is
a common way that states express their dissatisfaction with others and
try to influence behavior.]{.underline} As Lawrence Freedman observed in
1978, "refusing to sell arms is a major political act. [It appears as a
calculated insult, reflecting on the stability, trust, and
credit-worthiness, or technical competence of the would-be
recipient."]{.underline} Yet this crucial point seems to have been lost
in the current policy debate about whether or not the United States
should continue selling arms to Saudi Arabia. My research shows that
stopping arms transfers or denying requests is an effective way to
signal dissatisfaction and causes the would-be recipient to re-think
their behavior. [Take, for example, the U.S. relationship with Israel in
the 1960s.]{.underline} The United States sold Israel Hawk
surface-to-surface missiles in 1962, M-48 Patton tanks in 1964 and 1965,
and A-4E Skyhawk bombers in 1966. Israeli leaders understood that these
transfers signaled a close U.S.-Israeli relationship. As diplomat Abba
Eban wrote, the arms transfers were "a development of tremendous
political value." Even against this backdrop of close ties and
significant arms sales, [Israeli leaders were extremely sensitive to
arms transfer denials]{.underline}. In April and May [1967, the United
States denied Israeli requests for armored personnel carriers and
fighter jets]{.underline}. Approving the transfers would have signaled
support, and likely emboldened Israel, as tensions were growing in the
region. [Israeli leaders believed these transfer denials overruled prior
signals and demonstrated that the United States was not willing to be a
close political ally for Israel]{.underline}. [Eban described Israel as
"isolated]{.underline}," and the head of Israel's intelligence service
said that the arms transfer denials made it clear that "in Israel, there
existed certain misperceptions \[about the United States\]." [If arms
transfer denials could have such a significant effect on Israeli
thinking --- keeping in mind that there was a close and significant
political relationship between the US and Israel --- imagine what a
transfer denial would mean for U.S.-Saudi relations]{.underline}. Like
Israel, [Saudi Arabia would have **to re-think its impression** that it
has political support and approval from the United States.]{.underline}
We can, and should, ask whether or not withdrawal of U.S. support would
affect Saudi behavior, but it's important that this question not get
overlooked in the current debate. Because arms transfers (and denials)
are powerful signals, they can have an effect even before a transfer is
actually completed. This suggests that even the announcement of an
embargo against Saudi Arabia could have an effect. Take, for example,
Taiwan's recent request for a fleet of new fighter jets. As reports
mounted that Trump had given "tacit approval" to a deal for F-16 jets,
China's protests increased. The United States has not sold advanced
fighter jets to Taiwan since 1992, partially out of fear of angering
China, which views Taiwan as a renegade province. Even if the deal for
F-16s is formally approved, Taiwan is unlikely to see the jets until at
least 2021, and the balance of power between China and Taiwan would not
change. As one researcher observed, the sale would be a "huge shock" for
Beijing, "But it would be more of a political shock than a military
shock. It would be, 'Oh, the U.S. doesn't care how we feel.' It would be
more of a symbolic or emotional issue." Yet China's immediate, negative
reaction to even the announcement of a potential deal shows how powerful
arms transfer signals can be. If this same logic is applied to an arms
embargo against Saudi Arabia, an arms embargo would signal that Saudi
Arabia does not have the support of the United States. [This signal
**would be an important first step** in changing Saudi behavior because
it would override other statements and actions the United States has
sent that indicate support]{.underline}. And Trump has given Saudi
Arabia a number of positive signals: He called Saudi Arabia a "great
ally" and dismissed reports that that the Saudi government was involved
in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. He has expressed interested
in selling nuclear power plants and technology to Saudi Arabia. And he
has repeatedly claimed that he has made a \$110 billion arms deal with
Saudi Arabia (he hasn't). With these clear signals of support, why
should Saudi Arabia alter its behavior based on resolutions that come
out of the House or Senate, which are likely to be vetoed by Trump,
anyway? An arms embargo would be a clear and unambiguous signal that the
United States disproves of Saudi actions in Yemen. The second reason for
supporting an embargo concerns U.S. allies and the logistical
difficulties of making an embargo have an effect. [One of the reasons
embargoes have little material impact is because they require
cooperation among weapons exporting states]{.underline}. A ban on sales
from one country will have little effect if the target of the embargo
can seek arms elsewhere. Germany, instituted an arms ban against Riyadh
in November 2018, and German leaders have pressured other European
states to stop selling arms to the Saudis. Germany understands the
importance of the embargo as a political signal: as a representative of
the German Green Party explained, "The re-start of arms exports to Saudi
Arabia would be a fatal foreign policy signal and would contribute to
the continued destabilization of the Middle East." But the German
embargo has had minimal effect because Saudi Arabia can get arms
elsewhere. According to the 2019 Military Balance, most of Saudi
Arabia's equipment is American or French in origin, such as the M1A2
Abrams and AMX-30 tanks, Apache and Dauphin helicopters, and F-15C/D
fighter jets. Saudi Arabia has some equipment manufactured wholly or in
part in Germany, such as the Eurofighter Typhoon and the Tornado ground
attack craft, but these weapons are a small portion of its complete
arsenal. A [U.S. embargo would send an **important signal to the
allies** who also supply Saudi Arabia, allowing them to explain
participation in the embargo to their own domestic
constituencies]{.underline}. This is especially important for countries
like France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, that need to export arms
to keep their own production lines running. While the research shows
that sustaining an arms embargo is often the most difficult step,
[embargoes can restrain sending states' arms exports.]{.underline} Even
if a U.S. embargo won't have a direct effect on Saudi Arabia on its own,
[an embargo is important for **building coalitions** for a more
expansive embargo that could affect Saudi behavior.]{.underline} The
Difficulty of Stopping Atrocities [Beyond signaling, we know U.S. arms
sales often end up in the wrong hands, and have been used in
Yemen.]{.underline} The Saudi-led war in Yemen has led to starvation
conditions, caused thousands of civilian casualties, and has led to the
displacement of millions of people. The United Nations estimates that 80
percent of Yemen's population -- 24 million people -- require some form
of humanitarian or protection assistance, and that the severity of the
situation is increasing. Would an arms embargo create meaningful change
in Yemen? [An initial effect of an embargo is that Saudi Arabia would
have to work harder to access war materiel. As Jonathan Caverley noted,
more than **60 percent** of Saudi Arabia's arms delivered in the past
five years came from the United States]{.underline}. Even if this
percentage decreases over time, [it **will be costly** for Saudi Arabia
to transition to a primarily Russian- or Chinese-supplied
military]{.underline}. Though Saudi Arabia might be willing to pay this
cost, it would still have to pay, and take the time to transition to its
new weapons systems. [This would represent]{.underline} a brief [**break
in hostilities** that could **facilitate the delivery of aid** **and
assistance** in Yemen.]{.underline}

#### Restricting arms sales solves credibility and prolif ADV

So far we have argued that [arms sales lack a compelling strategic
justification, amplify risks, and generate a host of unintended negative
consequences. These factors alone argue for significantly curtailing the
arms trade. But the case for doing so is made even stronger by the fact
that greatly reducing arms sales would also produce two significant
benefits for the United States that cannot otherwise be enjoyed. **The
first benefit**]{.underline} from reducing arms sales would be [greater
diplomatic flexibility and leverage]{.underline}. Critics might argue
that even if arms sales are an imperfect tool, forgoing arms sales will
eliminate a potential source of leverage. We argue that, on the
contrary, [the diplomatic gains from forgoing arms sales will outweigh
the potential leverage or other benefits from arms sales. Most
importantly, by refraining from arming nations engaged in conflict, the
United States will have the diplomatic flexibility to engage with all
parties **as an honest broker**]{.underline}. The inherent difficulty of
negotiating while arming one side is obvious today with respect to North
and South Korea. After decades of U.S. support for South Korea, North
Korea clearly does not trust the United States. Similarly, U.S. attempts
to help negotiate a peace deal between the Israelis and Palestinians
have long been complicated by American support for Israel. [To stop
arming one side of a contentious relationship is not to suggest that the
United States **does not have a preferred outcome** in such cases.
Rather, by staying out of the military domain the United States can more
readily encourage **dialogue and diplomacy.** Forgoing arms sales is
likely to be a superior strategy even in cases where the United States
has an entrenched interest]{.underline}. In the case of Taiwan, for
example, though it is clear that Taiwan needs to purchase weapons from
other countries to provide for its defense, those weapons do not have to
be made in the United States. Having Taiwan buy from other suppliers
would help defuse U.S.-China tensions. Even if Taiwan's defenses
remained robust, China would clearly prefer a situation in which
American arms no longer signal an implicit promise to fight on Taiwan's
behalf. This could also promote more productive U.S.-China diplomacy in
general, as well as greater stability in the Pacific region. Most
important, breaking off arms sales would also reduce the likelihood of
the United States becoming entangled in a future conflict between Taiwan
and China. [The second major benefit of reducing arms sales is that it
would imbue the United States with **greater moral
authority**]{.underline}. [Today, as the leading arms-dealing nation in
the world, the United States lacks credibility in discussions of arms
control and nonproliferation, especially in light of its military
interventionism since 2001]{.underline}. [By showing the world that it
is ready to choose diplomacy over the arms trade, the United States
would provide a huge boost to international efforts to **curtail
proliferation** and its negative consequences]{.underline}. This is
important because the United States has pursued and will continue to
pursue a wide range of arms control and nonproliferation objectives. The
United States is a signatory of treaties dealing with weapons of mass
destruction, missile technology, land mines, and cluster munitions, not
to mention the flow of conventional weapons of all kinds. The
effectiveness of these treaties, and the ability to create more
effective and enduring arms control and nonproliferation frameworks,
however, depends on how the United States behaves. This is not to say
that unilateral American action will put an end to the problems of the
global arms trade. States would still seek to ensure their security and
survival through deterrence and military strength. Other weapons
suppliers would, in the short run, certainly race to meet the demand.
[But history shows that global nonproliferation treaties and weapons
bans typically require great-power support. In 1969, for example,
Richard Nixon decided to shutter the American
offensive-biological-weapons program and seek an international ban on
such weapons]{.underline}. [By 1972 the Biological Weapons Convention
passed and has since been signed by 178 nations.]{.underline}98 In 1991
[President George H. W. Bush unilaterally renounced the use of chemical
weapons. By 1993 the United States had signed the Chemical Weapons
Convention]{.underline}, which now has 192 signatories.99 [Both of these
efforts succeeded in part because the United States took decisive early
action in the absence of any promises about how others would
respond]{.underline}.100 [Without U.S. leadership, any effort to limit
proliferation of major conventional weapons and dangerous emerging
technologies is likely to fail.]{.underline}

A bipartisan group of senators is releasing legislation imposing
sanctions, prohibitions and restrictions against Saudi Arabia and other
entities considered responsible for the humanitarian suffering in
war-torn Yemen, the most punitive proposals to emerge from Congress
since Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered last month. [The
group]{.underline}, which is led by Sens. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) and
Todd C. Young (R-Ind.) and includes Trump confidant Lindsey O. Graham
(R-S.C.), is [calling for a **total prohibition on arms** sales to Saudi
Arabia that could be **used for offensive purposes**]{.underline}. [The
blanket embargo includes a ban on selling Riyadh munitions, bombs,
missiles, aircraft, tanks or armored vehicles, according to a person
familiar with the text, but does **not prevent the sale of purely
defensive systems**, such as missile interceptors. The measure would
also codify the Trump administration's recent decision to stop refueling
Saudi planes engaged in operations in Yemen against the Houthi
rebels]{.underline} and impose sanctions on anyone supporting the Houthi
rebellion --- namely, Iran --- within 30 days of the bill's passage.
Those who prevent the delivery of humanitarian aid to Yemeni civilians
would also be subject to new proposed sanctions in the bill that would
go into effect immediately. "[This bill makes clear that Congress
demands an immediate cessation of hostilities, urgently calls on all
parties to prioritize protection of Yemeni civilians, and makes certain
that only a political settlement will end this war,"]{.underline}
Menendez said in a statement. "[We are **putting teeth behind these
demands** with regular oversight, sanctions, and suspension of weapons
sales and refueling support."]{.underline} The bill came together in
response to mounting outrage among lawmakers of both parties over Saudi
Arabia's conduct, particularly in the murder of Khashoggi at its
consulate in Istanbul. Many lawmakers believe that operation could not
have taken place without the blessing of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman --- whom, thus far, the Trump administration has not sanctioned.
Congress's first response to Khashoggi's murder was invoking the Global
Magnitsky Act --- a law that requires Trump to decide within 120 days
what individuals are responsible for human rights abuses and what
sanctions should be imposed against them. On Thursday, the Trump
administration announced it would sanction 17 individuals under that
authority, just hours before the bipartisan group of senators released
their proposal. But for many, President Trump's move fell short. Sen.
Rand Paul (R-Ky.) ridiculed "putting sanctions on people who are in
prison" as a weak choice, while drafters of the new bill suspected that
Trump was trying to draw attention away from their more comprehensive
proposals. "It looks like some shameless coordination with a government
that has trampled on the rule of law," said a Senate aide familiar with
the bill. "It would defy credulity that the announcement came out today
when they know what we're doing here in the Senate . . . they're willing
to designate individuals in the inner circles of Mohammed bin Salman and
they won't say a damn thing about the crown prince himself." Several of
the provisions of the [new bill are **designed to force Trump to take a
harder stance** against the Saudi kingdom, which he all but fully
embraced upon becoming president while distancing himself from
Iran.]{.underline} The bill would make sanctions mandatory for anyone
found to have responsibility in Khashoggi's murder under the Global
Magnitsky Act. It would also require the administration to produce two
reports on Saudi Arabia. The first of those reports would address the
question of where the activities of the Saudi-led coalition, Houthi
rebels and others have risen to the level of war crimes, or otherwise
violated international humanitarian law and the laws of war. Another
would be focused on documenting Saudi Arabia's human rights abuses,
focusing on the government's suppression of women, bloggers and
religious freedom. The product of those reports, the Senate aide said,
could be easily compared to existing international studies to see if the
Trump administration's assessment of the situation in the Persian Gulf
is notably kinder to Saudi leaders. For Democrats, the bill's provisions
address deep skepticism that the Trump administration will hold
individuals at the highest levels of the Saudi government accountable,
either for the human cost of its actions in Yemen or the murder of
Khashoggi. Republican supporters are trying to strike a more coaxing
tone, encouraging the Trump administration to take advantage of the
tools in the bill. ["This legislation **provides the** Trump
administration **leverage it should use** to push all parties in Yemen
to engage in good faith and urgent negotiations to end the civil war and
address the world's worst humanitarian crisis,"]{.underline} Young said
in a statement. "Our national security interests and our humanitarian
principles demand nothing less." ["Our bill sends an important signal,
and when combined with the efforts announced by the Treasury Department,
goes a long way to address despicable behavior on several
fronts,"]{.underline} Graham said. Senate Armed Services Committee
ranking member Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.),
who sits on both the Armed Services and Senate Foreign Relations
Committees, are also original co-sponsors of the legislation.

The efficacy of withholding military assistance, including grant aid and
arms sales, to modify the behavior of recipient countries is a hotly
debated topic in the U.S. foreign policy community. Last month, War on
the Rocks published another contribution to this discussion. [In "The
Case Against Arms Embargos, Even for Saudi Arabia," Raymond Rounds
opposes what he calls an "arms embargo" on Saudi Arabia, arguing that
suspending U.S. arms sales as leverage over policy disagreements will
only backfire by driving the kingdom to purchase arms from other
countries]{.underline}. He contends that suspending sales to Saudi
Arabia will fail to alter objectionable Saudi conduct, whether in Yemen
or domestically, while "\[damaging\] ties with Saudi Arabia." According
to Rounds, this dynamic is not unique to Saudi Arabia, but a general
proposition that applies to all U.S. arms recipients. If he is correct,
arms embargoes --- a regular tool of U.S. foreign policy --- are
quixotic attempts to shape the behavior of foreign governments and put
the United States at a strategic disadvantage to global competitors.
[While this argument seems reasonable, if depressing, **it suffers
from** **two principal and serious** flaws.]{.underline} [First, **the
empirical record** does not support Rounds' contention that arms
embargoes do not deliver]{.underline}. While these suspensions are not a
silver bullet, [there is **ample evidence** to demonstrate that they
**can be effective** in changing the policy of a target
country.]{.underline} For example, [in 2005, the United
States]{.underline} successfully [used the suspension of a joint weapons
project to persuade Israel to cancel a proposed sale of drone equipment
to China]{.underline}. In another example, then-Secretary of State Rex
[Tillerson secured commitments from Egypt to resolve a longstanding
criminal case against 41 foreign NGO workers,]{.underline} including
Americans and Europeans, and [to suspend military cooperation with North
Korea in exchange for releasing \$195 million in suspended military
aid]{.underline}. More recently, the legislative hold Sen. Robert
Menendez placed on an arms sale to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates, when combined with threatened legislation to impose further
restrictions on transfers to Saudi Arabia, helped pressure the Saudi-led
coalition in Yemen to re-engage in negotiations with the Houthis,
resulting in an imperfect but still important deal on the port of
Hodeidah. [The author's argument that arms embargoes do not work cites
the 2013 suspension of U.S. military aid to Egypt following that
country's military coup]{.underline}. This policy clearly failed to
reverse the military coup led by current President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi,
but [there are good reasons to question the validity of the
example.]{.underline} [Proponents of the suspension argue with good
reason that it was **not given a fair chance** to work.]{.underline}
[Shortly after the decision]{.underline} was announced, senior U.S.
[officials told the Egyptians the aid]{.underline} [would soon be
restored, **undercutting** the coercive value]{.underline} of the
suspension. [From the perspective of the Egyptian government, it would
have been irrational to make serious concessions in response to what
they believed was an idle threat]{.underline}. Just as important, due to
a plethora of exceptions and carve-outs, some U.S. military assistance
to Egypt continued throughout the suspension period, including
maintenance and sustainment, sparing the Egyptian military from the full
force of the hold. BECOME A MEMBER [Despite undercutting its own
suspension, the hold still produced some good. U.S. diplomats were
**able to leverage** the policy to deter the Egyptian government from
enforcing an arbitrary September 2014 deadline for NGOs to register
under Egypt's draconian 2002 NGO law.]{.underline} And, although Egypt
released U.S. citizen Mohamed Soltan from prison two months after aid
was resumed, Cairo was partly motivated by the concern that the Obama
administration could reverse its decision to resume arms shipments. To
be sure, these accomplishments were relatively limited, and we should be
careful not to overestimate the efficacy of arms holds. A foreign
government is unlikely to fundamentally change its position on what it
views as an existential issue. [But prior suspensions have yielded
tangible gains, and they should remain part of the U.S. foreign policy
toolkit.]{.underline} [Second, Rounds also **overstates the costs** of
suspending arms transfers.]{.underline} He is particularly focused on
the potential for losing "access," a term that encompasses relationships
with the recipient country's military leadership; insight into their
views, organization, and doctrine; and permission for the U.S. military
to use that country's bases and airspace. These are legitimate concerns,
but [suspensions do not automatically compromise access. Egypt, for
instance, never curtailed the U.S. military ability to use the Suez
Canal or Egyptian airspace]{.underline} while arms transfers were on
hold. And, while intelligence about a foreign military is valuable, we
often have other, clandestine ways to acquire such information.
Moreover, [we should **not conflate** access with
influence]{.underline}. U.S. military officials had access to their
Egyptian counterparts during the events of 2013, but those channels were
of no use in deterring Egypt's military from removing the country's
democratically elected president. [Nor has U.S access **reduced civilian
casualties** from Saudi-coalition bombing in Yemen. In these cases,
access without influence does not absolve the United States of
complicity]{.underline}. [The author's other major concern is that arms
suspensions could result in the loss of arms sales to strategic
competitors like Russia or China]{.underline}. The jobs created by such
sales are not trivial matters, [but studies have found that they do not
provide the economic benefits or jobs that are often
touted]{.underline}. [Nor are these sales necessary to maintain the
military industrial base,]{.underline} which is powered by billions of
dollars each year from domestic purchases, except in rare cases.
Fundamentally, the author's implicit argument --- that if the United
States reliably supplies weapons to strategically important countries,
they won't seek them elsewhere --- is suspect. Countries, including
close partners like Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, have long sought
to diversify their weapons stockpiles, and in an increasingly multipolar
world, more countries are seeking to diversify their arms suppliers to
maintain their own independence. While U.S. arms will continue to
compete with Russian or Chinese counterparts on a sale-by-sale basis, it
will become increasingly unrealistic to be the exclusive supplier of any
partner country, irrespective of how reliable the United States is. The
reluctance to use the leverage afforded by arms transfers is symptomatic
of a broader pathology in U.S. foreign policy: a fixation on maintaining
relationships without regard to the value they provide. [Relationships
are important, but the United States should receive a commensurate
return on its investments. When this is not the case, the United States
should not hesitate to adjust the status and intimacy of a bilateral
relationship, including through the suspension of arms
transfers]{.underline}. Contrary to Rounds' argument, [such steps can
yield important policy gains. Even if they do not, we can at least avoid
some of the **blowback** of **enabling reckless and rights-abusing
actions**.]{.underline} Distance does not have the allure of access, but
it may ultimately put the United States in a stronger strategic
position.

Knowing that the Saudis are intent on building up their
already-extensive defense capabilities, [President Trump has expressed
fear that if they can't buy what they want from the United States, they
will buy from other countries, possibly including Russia or
China.]{.underline} That, too, **[is unlikely]{.underline}**, because
[much of what the Saudis want consists of upgrades and spare parts for
U.S.-made weapons **they already have.**]{.underline} Moreover, [the
Saudi purchases of modern weapons systems usually come with a training
component]{.underline}, [by which the manufacturer and the U.S. military
teach the Saudis how to operate and maintain the equipment]{.underline}.
[**So deeply** is the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[**embedded** in the Saudi military and domestic security
forces,]{.underline} whose [officers are largely
American-trained]{.underline}, that a **[defection]{.underline}** [from
U.S. supply lines would **represent a major disruption.** In addition,
commanders of the U.S. Central Command]{.underline}, which is
responsible for U.S. military operations all across the Middle East and
South Asia, [have spent most of the past decade]{.underline} [trying to
get Saudi Arabia]{.underline} and its fractious neighbors [to integrate
their operations and weapons systems with each other's and with those of
the United States.]{.underline} In his 2018 annual report to Congress
the current CENTCOM commander, Gen. Joseph Votel, emphasized a strategy
of "operations by, with, and through our partners...The 'total package'
approach with which we pursue equipment support and long-term
sustainment ensures that maintenance support and training are part of
the FMS \[Foreign Military Sales\] plan from the outset." [There is not
much room for Russian or Chinese weaponry in that "total
package."]{.underline} President Trump no doubt has many reasons for his
unwillingness to punish Saudi Arabia or cut off his close relationship
with the crown prince. The prospect of losing out on lucrative military
sales should not be among them.

discourages Saudi Arabia from finding different ones.]{.underline} Mr.
Trump on Thursday cited "four or five alternatives" to American weapons,
and the need to avoid "letting Russia have that money and letting China
have that money." [This, however, **is unlikely** even in the long
term.]{.underline} [Saudi Arabia is in the middle of a major war, and
**more than 60 percent** of its arms deliveries over the past five years
came from the United States.]{.underline} The Saudi [military relies not
just on American tanks, planes and missiles but for a daily **supply of
maintenance, training and support**, such as intelligence and
refueling.]{.underline} In the longer term, almost all of Saudi Arabia's
remaining exports come from Europe. [To truly squeeze Saudi Arabia, **a
coordinated embargo** --- much like the one now in place against Russia
--- would be necessary but relatively easy. European governments already
feel strong domestic political pressure not to export to regimes like
Saudi Arabia.]{.underline} [Transforming the Saudi military to employ
Russian, much less Chinese, weapons would cost a fortune even by Gulf
standards, would require years of retraining and would greatly reduce
its military power for a generation**. Russia cannot produce**
**next-generation** fighter aircraft]{.underline}, [tanks and infantry
fighting vehicles]{.underline} for its own armed forces, much less for
the export market. [**China has not** **produced**, never mind exported,
the sophisticated **aircraft and missile defense systems** Saudi Arabia
wants.]{.underline} Last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo certified
that Saudi Arabia was minimizing civilian casualties in the Yemen air
campaign apparently to avoid jeopardizing \$2 billion in weapons sales.
That small number does not show how powerful the Saudis are so much as
how cheaply the United States can be bought. [Given these sales' low
domestic economic impact and the enormous costs of going elsewhere for
Saudi Arabia, the United States has the **preponderance of influence**
in this arms trade relationship.]{.underline} It should act accordingly.

[Trump\'s claim that Russia or China]{.underline} [will]{.underline}
quickly [swoop in to grab any arms deal]{.underline} [the United States
declines to conclude with the Saudi regime]{.underline} [is]{.underline}
also [suspect]{.underline}. The [**Saudi arsenal** is]{.underline}
heavily **[dependent on U.S]{.underline}.-** and UK-supplied
**[weaponry]{.underline}**. [It **would take** many
**years**]{.underline} [and tens of **billions of dollars to change
course**]{.underline} in any meaningful way - money that Riyadh can ill
afford as it hemorrhages money for its brutal war in Yemen and tries to
cope with unstable oil prices. [It\'s]{.underline} always
[possible]{.underline} that the [Saudi military would make a token
purchase from Russia or China]{.underline} [to send a signal, but the
idea that the United States would lose out]{.underline} on a huge volume
of arms sales [as a result is unlikely in the extreme.]{.underline}

[Saudi Arabia has gone on a massive arms-buying spree]{.underline},
according to a new report by the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute (SIPRI). [In the last five years, Saudi]{.underline} Arabia
[increased]{.underline} [its]{.underline} arms [purchases]{.underline}
[by]{.underline} [225 percent]{.underline} compared to the previous
five-year period. [Yearly sales from Western countries]{.underline} to
Middle Eastern countries [have]{.underline} [increased]{.underline} over
the past decade, [with US arms sales to Saudi Arabia rising from under
\$400 million]{.underline} in 2010 [to \$10 billion in
2017]{.underline}. Sales from the United Kingdom rose from \$550 million
to \$4 billion for the same period. [Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, however,
[has]{.underline} in the process [upped the percentage of its purchases
from **Europe and the U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[to]{.underline}** **[98 percent of its overall arms
imports]{.underline}**. **[This]{.underline}** is a significant
**[dependency that would be]{.underline}** very hard, if not
**[impossible, to break.]{.underline}** **[Saudi Arabia's attempts to
diversify its sources]{.underline}** of weaponry **[has]{.underline}**
thus far **[been unsuccessful]{.underline}**. [This dependency goes
beyond mere dollar figures]{.underline} and percentages **[to the
difficulty of changing weapon systems, personnel training, and war
strategies]{.underline}**. Here **[the]{.underline}** **[dependency is
total because]{.underline}** while **[European weapons
can]{.underline}** easily **[be made interoperable with US
weapons]{.underline}**, **[this is not the case with
weapons]{.underline}** purchased **[from Russia and
China.]{.underline}** **[The Saudis would need a]{.underline}**n
entirely **[different approach and training for their
military]{.underline}** forces. Bruce Riedel, the author of Kings and
Presidents, a book that narrates the story of Saudi dependency on the
United States, says that [of the]{.underline} Gulf Cooperation Council
([GCC]{.underline}) [countries]{.underline}, **[Saudi Arabia would have
the most difficulty in switching]{.underline}** over **[to a different
system of security and weaponry]{.underline}**. [This]{.underline} Saudi
[dependency is not new]{.underline}. [The kingdom has relied on the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates for its security [since the
very beginning]{.underline}, when Franklin D. Roosevelt struck an oil
versus security arrangement with King Abdulaziz toward the end of World
War II.

An initial effect of an embargo is that Saudi Arabia would have to work
harder to access war materiel. As Jonathan Caverley noted, [more than 60
percent of Saudi Arabia's arms]{.underline} delivered [in the past five
years came from the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [Even if
this]{.underline} percentage [decreases]{.underline} over time, **[it
will be costly for Saudi Arabia to transition to a]{.underline}**
primarily **[Russian- or Chinese-supplied military]{.underline}**.
Though [Saudi]{.underline} Arabia might be willing to pay this cost, it
[would]{.underline} still [have to pay, and **take**]{.underline} the
**[time to transition to its new weapons systems]{.underline}**. This
would represent a brief break in hostilities that could facilitate the
delivery of aid and assistance in Yemen.

### A2: Circumvention---General 

#### No circumvention -- durable fiat guarantees a veto-proof majority in congress which means that congress can block Trump's arms sale

DOA: 6/9/19 GMDI

Secretary of State Mike [Pompeo notified Congress]{.underline} on Friday
that President Trump, [citing "Iranian malign activity" and threatened
increased actions by Houthi combatants in Yemen]{.underline}, [would
invoke an emergency provision of the Arms Export Control Act to complete
sales that Congress [had not
approved](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2019-01/news/senate-bucks-trump%E2%80%99s-saudi-approach)]{.underline}.
Except there doesn't seem to be an emergency --- just the president's
inability (once again) to get what he wants from Congress. So he forges
ahead on a pretext and dares someone to stop him. It's a page from [the
same playbook he used to shift Pentagon
money](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-trump-emergency-declaration-20190215-story.html)
--- that Congress had approved for defense purposes --- to augment wall
construction and other security measures along the southwest border that
Congress refused to approve. There are two things going on here. In the
past, when lawmakers assumed the White House would be occupied by
someone with the nation's best interests in mind, Congress gave the
president [various
authorities](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/98-505.pdf) to move quickly
when circumstances demand it. It even limited its own ability to check
that power, a decision that now seems foolish. [Under the National
Emergencies Act, Congress can overrule a presidential declaration, but
the president can veto any such decision]{.underline}. [Which means it
would take two-thirds of both houses to end a national emergency
declaration]{.underline}. Not quite carte blanche for the president, but
awfully close. And naturally, [it would take a veto-proof majority of
both houses to change that law and seize power back from the
president.]{.underline}

**[Congress is not without options]{.underline}** [in responding to this
assault on its powers]{.underline}, however. [Republican and Democratic
senators are joining together to disapprove all 22 "emergency" sales
proposed by the president. Even if there is insufficient time to pass
resolutions of disapproval for these particular sales before the
agreements are signed, **Congress could pass a law** **to prohibit**
**the delivery** of these weapons systems]{.underline}. It could also
override the president's veto of its resolution to end U.S. military
participation in the Saudi-led war in Yemen, which would require the
support of Republican senators. [It could **impose a ban** or strict
conditions **on all future weapons** sales to Saudi Arabia]{.underline}
and the UAE. And it could rewrite the procedures for consideration and
review of arms sales. Instead of allowing weapons to be transferred
unless two-thirds of both houses vote to override the inevitable
presidential veto of attempted blocking legislation, Congress could
treat major arms sales with at least the seriousness it treats trade
agreements, which require affirmative congressional approval to move
forward[.]{.underline} In short, Congress must fight to reclaim its
relevance as an active participant in foreign policy and national
security decisions.Returning from its Memorial Day recess, [Congress
**has no lack of** foreign policy emergencies to respond to]{.underline}
-- [walking the administration back from the brink of war]{.underline}
with Iran chief among them. But if it can't stand up to protect its own
prerogatives on arms sales, then its chances of being heard on anything
else will be permanently diminished.
