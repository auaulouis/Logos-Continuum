Arms Transfers,"

Summary:

Every year, the United States Congress appropriates billions of dollars
to support foreign security forces by supplying training and equipment
in an effort to maintain foreign policy and national security
objectives. However, [few avenues exist to hold foreign governments and
militaries accountable for misusing]{.underline} the [equipment,
**raising concerns about American complicity in human rights abuses
across the globe**]{.underline}. [Several laws place restrictions on
weapons provision to countries who commit human rights abuses, but **the
process for implementing these restrictions is often politicized,
placing short-term priorities over long-term stability**.]{.underline}
[For major arms buyers such as Israel, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia---where
evidence exists that U.S.-manufactured equipment has been used in human
rights abuses---this tradeoff **threatens both domestic and regional
stability in an already volatile region**.]{.underline}

Political Context:

[In the U.S. government, **political motivations to maintain bilateral
relationships often outweigh the enforcement of accountability
mechanisms to enforce human rights conditions** related to U.S. security
assistance. Even when verifiable information of human rights abuses by
specific foreign security units exists, accountability mechanisms have
been sidelined.]{.underline} For example, Congress annually appropriates
around \$3.3 billion in security assistance to Israel, making it the
largest security assistance package the U.S. gives to a single country.
Despite reports by international rights organizations detailing human
rights abuses at the hands of Israeli security forces, including the use
of U.S.-manufactured weapons to harm civilian populations,
[accountability mechanisms have not been enforced to ensure the annual
security assistance package to Israel does not contribute to
violations]{.underline}.

Similarly, growing awareness of violations by Saudi Arabia has raised
questions about U.S. adherence to the Arms Export Control Act of 1976
(AECA) and Leahy Law (further details provided later in this brief),
given that as of March 2019, Saudi Arabia had over \$129 billion in
active arms sales agreements with the U.S. A 2017 report by the American
Bar Association (ABA) analyzed U.S. security assistance to Saudi Arabia
under the AECA in light of growing evidence of gross human rights
violations (GHRVs) at the hands of the Saudi regime. U.S. weapons sold
to the Saudi regime have been used in Yemen, contributing to high
civilian casualties as the result of indiscriminate bombing campaigns.
There is evidence that U.S. arms shipments have been funneled to
militias and extremist groups in Yemen, including al-Qaeda in the
Arabian Peninsula, by Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners.

The ABA report concluded that all arms sales to Saudi Arabia should stop
until measures have been taken to ensure compliance with U.S. export
laws and international law. Although the assessment found that the U.S.
government was in violation of its statutory obligations, arms sales to
Saudi Arabia are still a point of contention among policymakers. In
March 2019, a group of bipartisan lawmakers passed legislation that
called on President Donald Trump to end U.S. support to Saudi Arabia;
Trump vetoed the bill. In May 2019, Trump announced that he would be
invoking an obscure clause in the AECA in order to bypass congressional
review of new arms sales to Saudi Arabia. The clause requires that he
certify the sales are necessary in the case of a national security
"emergency;" this action has drawn harsh criticism from members of
Congress.

Each year, the U.S. appropriates \$1.3 billion in foreign military
financing (FMF) to Egypt. [Although human rights abuses in Egypt have
been detailed in the State Department's annual Country Reports on Human
Rights, a national security waiver has been issued to ensure Egypt
receives U.S. security assistance in successive Democratic and
Republican administrations.]{.underline} In 2018, Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo issued a four-page waiver that outlined a myriad of human
rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, censorship, and
coerced confessions. However, the waiver noted that Egypt's control of
the Suez Canal and overflight approvals in support of counter-terror
operations benefit the U.S., and that the FMF is required under the Camp
David Accords.

Legal Context:

In the United States, [the]{.underline} Arms Export Control Act of 1976
[(AECA) and the Foreign Assistance Act]{.underline} of 1961 (FAA) [are
the guiding statutes for U.S. security assistance to foreign
countries]{.underline}. Together, the two laws regulate arms transfers,
arms sales, security training, and the transfer of nuclear technology.
The laws also dictate conditions in which the U.S. should not provide
security assistance. [Among such conditions is the human rights
situation of the foreign country slated to receive U.S. security
assistance.]{.underline} Specifically, [Section 502B of the]{.underline}
Foreign Assistance Act ([FAA) stipulates that the U.S. is prohibited
from providing military assistance to "any country the government of
which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of
internationally recognized human rights."]{.underline} However,
policymakers often view\[7\] Section 502B as overly restrictive due to
the broad language that any country whose gFovernment engages in human
rights abuses will be denied U.S. assistance. If a country was
blacklisted by Section 502B, the law did not provide any steps by which
the country in question could regain security assistance. As a result,
many lawmakers have complained the law has been a hindrance to achieving
U.S. foreign policy objectives in some areas, and [Section 502B has
seldom been enforced]{.underline}.

[In an effort to make Section 502B more flexible to U.S. foreign policy
and national security interests]{.underline}, congressional officials,
led by Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), introduced [the "Leahy
Law"]{.underline} into annual appropriations bills in 1997, and was made
permanent in 2008 by adding similar language to the Foreign Assistance
Act in 2008. Added to Section 502B, the Leahy Law [includes two
amendments that govern security assistance provided by the State
Department and Department of Defense]{.underline}. Although separate
amendments, [both include language that states "no assistance shall be
furnished under this Act or the **A**]{.underline}rms
**[E]{.underline}**xport **[C]{.underline}**ontrol **[A]{.underline}**ct
[to any unit of the security forces of a foreign country if there is
credible information that such unit has committed a gross violation of
human rights." The law also provides a remediation process for foreign
security units that have been blacklisted, allowing them to regain the
privilege of U.S. security assistance.]{.underline} By narrowing the
scope to the unit level of foreign security forces, many policymakers
feel the Leahy Law provides the necessary flexibility to uphold U.S.
morals while prioritizing national security and foreign policy. Despite
its best intentions, however, the Leahy Law is rarely utilized.

Aside from security assistance, the AECA also governs export licensing.
Typically, the president, in coordination with the secretary of state,
must notify Congress of any sale of defense articles or services under
for \$50 million or more, any design and construction services for \$200
million or more, or any major defense equipment for \$14 million or
more, and allow Congress 30 days to review the sale and register
concern. However, the law also includes a clause\[8\] allowing the
president to override congressional oversight of a sale if the president
"states in the certification that an emergency exists which requires the
proposed export in the national security interests of the United
States."

Process:

[The agencies in charge of enforcing Leahy Law are the State Department
and occasionally the Department of Defense.]{.underline} As previously
mentioned, [the text of the Leahy Law is intended]{.underline}\[9\] [to
ensure human rights vetting for all assistance and training, including
that which falls under the]{.underline} **[A]{.underline}**rms
**[E]{.underline}**xport **[C]{.underline}**ontrol
**[A]{.underline}**ct. [This includes]{.underline} foreign military
sales ([FMS]{.underline}), foreign military financing
([FMF]{.underline}), [and]{.underline} direct commercial sales
([DCS]{.underline}). However, **[in practice, the State Department has
only applied the law to most training programs and some equipment
furnished through assistance programs, but not direct arms
sales]{.underline}**. Although the State Department does review
licensing that falls under DCS, they do not weigh in matters pertaining
to Leahy Law.

[Gaps also exist during the implementation and vetting
process.]{.underline} When foreign security units are slated to receive
U.S. security assistance, in-country embassy personnel conduct initial
vetting using open-source data and information provided by officials
from the foreign security apparatus. The information is subsequently
passed to personnel at the State Department in Washington in the Bureau
of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (DRL) and taken into consideration
along with classified information collected by DRL staff. Although
straightforward, [the process has been known to be marred by a lack of
transparency and obstacles to thorough vetting]{.underline}, as
exemplified in [a]{.underline} 2016 Government Accountability Office
([GAO]{.underline}) [report]{.underline}\[10\] on U.S. security
assistance to Egypt. The report found that Egyptian officials were
uncooperative with security checks and end-use monitoring. The report
also [found that **the State Department did not conduct Leahy Law
vetting for human rights abuses in all cases of arms transfers and
training to Egyptian military forces**]{.underline}. It is unclear what
actions, if any, have been taken to remedy the concerns outlined in the
report.

Trend Analysis:

**[The politicization of the Leahy Law is best evidenced by looking at
the history of its enforcement.]{.underline}** However, the State
Department seldom publicizes cases when Leahy Law has been implemented.
[According to open-source information, the Leahy Law has been enforced
in Colombia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Nigeria. **There is no
evidence that the Leahy Law has been implemented in the Middle East, in
countries that receive weapons and have a history of human rights abuses
such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Israel.**]{.underline}

Implications:

[In their current form, legal mechanisms for accountability in arms
transfers]{.underline} (namely the AECA, FAA and Leahy Law) [are
**weakened by policies that regularly place human rights, application of
the law, and long-term stability aside in favor of short-term national
security objectives**.]{.underline} As mentioned above, [this tradeoff
is best exemplified by the **continual use of national security waivers
to continue providing arms to foreign security forces despite human
rights abuses**]{.underline}. [While the waiver of human rights
conditions stipulates that aid may be restored if the "provision of
assistance is vital to the national security interests of
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates,"
[the term "national security" is left undefined, allowing for a broad
interpretation.]{.underline}

For countries that receive U.S. security assistance, the implications
for the civilian population and overall stability of the country are
most concerning. [Aside from the direct human cost of the use of deadly
force against civilians, **scholarly research**]{.underline} \[11\]
[**has demonstrated that security assistance to "fragile states" may
encourage the government to rely on repressive means in response to
dissent and threats to domestic security, thereby closing off channels
of peaceful expression of popular will, risking further
insecurity**.]{.underline} Additionally, the inability to document end
use, and (as is the case in Yemen) the turnover of American-made
materiel to armed nonstate actors, further risks U.S. national security
interests.

#### American arms manufacturers [profit from death]{.underline} \-\-- they're helping oppressive governments [wage World War 3]{.underline} on vulnerable populations

Manufacturers Are Abetting Crimes against Humanity; Our leading weapons

<https://fpif.org/in-yemen-and-beyond-u-s-arms-manufacturers-are-abetting-crimes-against-humanity/>,

[The Saudi bombing of a school bus in Yemen]{.underline} on August 9,
2018 [killed 44 children and wounded many more]{.underline}. The attack
struck a nerve in the U.S., confronting the American public with the
wanton brutality of the Saudi-led war on Yemen. When CNN revealed that
[the bomb used]{.underline} in the airstrike [was made by U.S. weapons
manufacturer Lockheed Martin]{.underline}, the horror of the atrocity
hit even closer to home for many Americans.

[But the killing and maiming of civilians with U.S.-made weapons in war
zones around the world is an all too regular occurrence.]{.underline}
**[U.S. forces are directly responsible for largely uncounted civilian
casualties in all America's wars, and the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[is also the world's
leading arms exporter]{.underline}**.

**[Pope Francis has publicly blamed the "industry of death" for fueling
a "piecemeal World War III."]{.underline}** The U.S. military-industrial
complex wields precisely the "unwarranted influence" over U.S. foreign
policy that President Eisenhower warned Americans against in his
farewell address in 1961.

The U.S. wars on Afghanistan and Iraq and the "global war on terror"
served as cover for a huge increase in U.S. military spending. Between
1998 and 2010, the U.S. spent \$1.3 trillion on its wars, but even more,
\$1.8 trillion, to buy new warplanes, warships, and weapons, most of
which were unrelated to the wars it was fighting.

Five U.S. companies --- Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin,
Boeing, and General Dynamics --- dominate the global arms business,
raking in \$140 billion in weapons sales in 2017, and export sales make
up a growing share of their business, about \$35 billion in 2017.

In a new report for Code Pink and the Divest from the War Machine
campaign, we have documented how [Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Egypt have
systematically used weapons produced by]{.underline} these five [U.S.
companies to massacre civilians, destroy civilian infrastructure, and
commit other war crimes. **The bombing of the school bus was only the
latest in a consistent pattern of Saudi massacres and air strikes on
civilian targets, from hospitals to marketplaces, and U.S. arms sales to
Israel and Egypt follow a similar pattern.**]{.underline}

**[U.S. laws require the suspension of arms sales to countries that use
them in such illegal ways, but the U.S. State Department has an
appalling record on enforcing these laws.]{.underline}** Under the
influence of Acting Assistant Secretary of State Charles Faulkner, a
former lobbyist for Raytheon, Secretary Pompeo falsely certified to
Congress that Saudi Arabia and the UAE are complying with U.S. law in
their use of American weapons.

The U.S. sells weapons to Saudi Arabia and other allies to project U.S.
military power by proxy without the U.S. military casualties, domestic
political backlash, and international resistance that result from direct
uses of U.S. military force, while U.S. military-industrial interests
are well-served by ever-growing arms sales to allied governments.

These policies are driven by the very combination of military-industrial
interests that Eisenhower warned Americans against, now represented by
Secretary Pompeo, Acting Assistant Secretary Faulkner, and a cabal of
hawkish Democrats who consistently vote with Republicans on war and
peace issues. They ensure that the "war party" always wins its battles
in Congress no matter how catastrophically its policies fail in the real
world.

Republicans derided President Obama's doctrine of covert and proxy war
as "leading from behind." But the [Trump]{.underline} administration
[has doubled down on Obama's failed strategy, surrendering even more
power over U.S. policy to foreign clients like Saudi Arabia, Israel, and
Egypt, and to the "unwarranted influence" of the U.S.
military-industrial complex]{.underline}.

Lockheed Martin is earning \$29.1 billion in sales from the \$110
billion Saudi arms package announced in May 2017, a deal struck as the
war on Yemen was already killing thousands of civilians. Yet no conflict
of interest is too glaring for Lockheed executives like Ronald
Perrilloux Jr., who has taken part in public events to promote the war
and defend Saudi Arabia and its allies, arguing that the U.S. should
"help them finish the job" in Yemen.

Not to be outdone, Boeing, the second largest arms producer in the U.S.
and the world after Lockheed Martin, has also been linked to the deaths
of hundreds of civilians in Yemen. Fragments of Boeing JDAM bombs were
found in the debris of a 2016 attack on a marketplace near the Yemeni
capital of Sana'a that killed 107 civilians, including 25 children.
Human Rights Watch found that the airstrike caused predictably
indiscriminate and disproportionate civilian deaths, in violation of the
laws of war, and called for a suspension of arms sales to Saudi Arabia.

[**To profit from wars on some of the poorest, most vulnerable people in
the world, from Yemen to Gaza to Afghanistan, Raytheon, Northrop
Grumman, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and General Dynamics have developed a
business model that feeds on war, terrorism, chaos, political
instability, human rights violations, disregard for international law,
and the triumph of militarism over diplomacy.** Real diplomacy to bring
peace and disarmament to our war-torn world poses the most serious
"threat" to their profits.]{.underline}

But **[the American people have never voted to funnel the largest share
of our taxes into endless war and ever-growing profits for the "industry
of death." It is time for]{.underline}** the sleeping giant, what
President Eisenhower called **["an alert and knowledgeable citizenry,"
to]{.underline}** wake from its slumber, **[take responsibility for our
country's foreign policies and act decisively for peace]{.underline}**.

#### Arms sales fuels [conflict escalation]{.underline} \-\-- default to [scholarly literature]{.underline}

Accessed: 6-24-2019 //GBS Rudolph)

[Do arms sales cause war? Or do wars cause arms sales?]{.underline}
Critics of arms sales often argue that selling weapons abroad fuels
conflict. And indeed, one can point to one or more sides using American
weapons in many recent conflicts including Syria, Yemen, and Iraq.
Skeptics argue, on the other hand, that weapons don't start the fire and
that conflicts would arise whether or arms exporters like the United
States sell weapons abroad.

[The debate has important implications for foreign policy]{.underline}.
[If selling or transferring weapons abroad makes conflict more likely,
or intensifies conflicts already in process, then **the United States
should rethink its long-held policy of selling weapons** to pretty much
any nation that wants them]{.underline}. If, on the other hand, [arms
sales have no impact on conflict or make conflict less
likely]{.underline}, then the Trump administration's intention of
expanding arms sales should be seen as a positive move.

As it turns out, several academic studies have looked at this question.
The primary conclusion of these works is that although arms sales do not
create conflicts out of thin air, [they do make conflict more likely
when the conditions for conflict are already present]{.underline}.

The basic logic behind this conclusion is fairly straightforward and has
been noted in the academic literature for some time. In a 1998 article,
"Arms Transfer Dependence and Foreign Policy Conflict," David Kinsella
argues that states that enjoy a steady flow of arms -- especially from
multiple countries -- tend to pursue more aggressive foreign policies.
[The increase in the recipient's military capability makes victory in a
potential conflict more likely, which in turn **raises the likelihood
that the state will start disputes, demand concessions from its
neighbors in those disputes, and to escalate to conflict if negotiations
fail to produce the desired outcome**]{.underline}. [Using case studies
from Israel, Egypt, Syria, Iran, Iraq, India, Pakistan, Ethiopia, and
Somalia Kinsella finds that, when a country has more than one weapons
supplier, arms sales drastically increase the chances of
conflict.]{.underline}

In their 2002 article, "The Arms Trade and the Incidence of Political
Violence in Sub-Saharan Africa, 1967-97," Cassady Craft and Joseph
Smaldone identify another mechanism by which arms sales can fuel
conflict. They find that **[autocratic governments importing weapons are
more likely to use those weapons to oppress/mistreat/kill their own
citizens since they now have a greater coercive
capability]{.underline}**.

But despite the straightforward logic behind the arms sales/conflict
connection, most work on the topic to date has relied on case studies,
which are wonderful for highlighting potential causal mechanisms but not
much use for establishing whether those mechanisms hold across the time
and space. Until recently there had not been any work using statistical
methods that would allow scholars to state with confidence which
direction the causal mechanism actually flows -- that is, do arms sales
precede conflict or do impending conflicts lead to increased arms sales?
Happily, the most recent article on arms sales by Oliver Pamp and his
colleagues in the January 2018 issue of the Journal of Peace Research
entitled, "The Build-Up of Coercive Capacities: Arms Imports and the
Outbreak of Violent Intrastate Conflict," uses a simultaneous equations
model to overcome this problem. Looking at the relationship between arms
sales and the outbreak of civil conflicts, the authors confirm the
general thrust of previous research, concluding that:

["...while arms imports are not a genuine cause of intrastate conflicts,
**they significantly increase the probability of an onset in countries
where conditions are notoriously conducive to conflict**]{.underline}.
In such situations, [arms are not an effective deterrent but rather
spark conflict escalation]{.underline}."

This new confidence in the arms sales/conflict connection should compel
serious revision to American arms sales policies. Since 2002 the United
States has sold over \$286 billion dollars of weapons to 167 countries.
These exports have gone to numerous countries where the conditions were
or remain ripe for conflict. [U.S. arms transfers to an unstable Iraq
preceded the emergence of the Islamic State, but wound up helping
amplify the Islamic State's military capability when it took vast
quantities of American weapons from defeated Iraqi army units. U.S. arms
sales over the past decade also helped prepare Saudi Arabia to launch
its disastrous intervention in Yemen and enabled the Nigerian government
to unleash more effective violence on its own citizens, just to list a
few examples.]{.underline}

Academic research often gets a bad rap in policy making circles. In the
case of arms sales and arms transfers, however, **[the scholarly
literature has correctly pointed out the serious risks]{.underline}**
involved. [If the United States is serious about preventing conflict and
managing regional stability in trouble spots around the globe, **it
would do well to stop pouring gas on the fire**]{.underline}.

#### Unregulated arms sales magnify atrocities like [genocide]{.underline} and [crimes against humanity]{.underline} and directly contribute to [famine]{.underline}, [family segregation]{.underline}, [disease]{.underline}, [lack of education]{.underline}, and [refugees]{.underline} \-\-- a [state-based solution]{.underline} is necessary

**Musa, Lecturer in International Law at The University of Manchester,
17** (Winter 2017, Shavana, Journal of Conflict & Security Law, "The
Saudi-Led Coalition in Yemen, Arms Exports and Human Rights: Prevention
Is Better Than Cure," doi:10.1093/jcsl/krx013, JMP) **\*\*\*CAAT =
Campaign Against the Arms Trade**

Despite the impact of arms transfers, as shown by the Saudi-led
Coalition's actions in Yemen, there is a drought in the number of
international lawyers contending with issues on the regulation of the
arms trade and thus, on the prevention of violations. It has become
apparent that international lawyers have a general preoccupation to deal
with the international applicability of laws after the fact, usually
after a violation has occurred and how it can be remedied. The judicial
review case brought by CAAT concerning UK arms transfers to Saudi
Arabia, which the High Court subsequently rejected, is a prime example
of legal work (including critical scholarship) taking effect after mass
atrocity. Much more international legal work to properly assist
governments in the application of international laws on the arms trade
is needed. [If the arms trade is regulated properly, it could
potentially prevent, or at least reduce the exponential rises in human
rights and humanitarian law violations and the commission of crimes such
as **genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity**.]{.underline}
This is because **[the global arms trade is the substrate for these
violations and crimes]{.underline}**. There is a causal link between
strict international law considerations preexport and levels of deaths
and casualties post-export. [There is]{.underline} also [an indirect
socio-economic impact from armed conflicts and international crimes, as
fuelled by poorly regulated arms, including famine, family segregation,
disease, lack of education, refugee levels and even a decline in foreign
investment]{.underline}---the list is not exhaustive.1 It is also
believed that **[conventional weapons, such as small arms, cause far
more deaths than any other weapon]{.underline}**.2

[These links affirm the greater obligations that must be placed upon
States and suppliers to effectively control arms transfers and provide a
basis to reinforce the evolving norm against these specific actors,
rather than merely those pulling the trigger.]{.underline}3 While the
Yemen case has perhaps placed a more magnified spotlight on the
responsibility of States with regard to authorized transfers, there have
been endless examples of authorized transfers that were utilized for the
purposes of infringing human rights and humanitarian law. Belgium, has
in the past, approved the transfer of arms to Nepal, even though its
government had been involved in violations such as summary executions,
as well as the torture and abduction of civilians.4 Past transfers to
Rwanda, the DRC and Sri Lanka5 have also caused the shift towards a
stronger link between arms transfers and the responsibility of States,
not just the end-user. While international law has come a long way in
terms of content, legal developments on the arms trade has been somewhat
lacking.

Perhaps the most significant of developments is the entering into force
of the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT).6 While the Arms Trade Secretariat in
Geneva is the main organ responsible for the Treaty's implementation,
there is still a long road ahead before standardized human
rights-adhering arms export processes can be integrated within national
frameworks, as per the Treaty text. This was apparent from discussions
between states during the preparatory process for the Third Conference
of States Parties (CSP3), which took place in September 2017. A number
of issues on effective treaty implementation, transparency and reporting
and treaty universalization came to the fore and were the basis of
working groups for the ATT's application in national states.7

This article pays specific attention to the importance of integrating
human rights and humanitarian laws within arms exporting processes. It
will analyse the development of international law on arms transfers, but
do so within the context of the Yemen conflict, and thus the involvement
of the British and the USA in their supply of weapons to the Saudi-led
Coalition. This article, however, will not deal with the political
context of the conflict itself, only as it relates to UK and US sales to
Saudi Arabia. **[Ultimately, it is national governments that authorize
licences for the sale of arms to importers. Therefore, States must apply
arms control laws strictly to prevent human rights
abuses.]{.underline}** The difficulty surrounding that implementation is
no better exemplified than the Yemen case. In addition, [there is the
need for exporting states to recognize that their duty to abide by
international law is not relinquished upon the completion of an arms
transaction and additional measures must be undertaken to also ensure
the prevention of human rights and humanitarian law
violations]{.underline}, as will be dealt with later on in the article.
Given the involvement of the UK and USA, the article will focus on these
national frameworks and then broadly assess how all [states
can]{.underline} in general [strengthen their arms trade national
processes to conform to international law]{.underline}---particularly
the ATT---[and **prevent the diversion of arms to countries in
precarious or fragile situations, which results in the commission of
extensive human rights and humanitarian law violations**]{.underline}.

4 THE EFFECTS OF THE ARMS TRADE?

Researchers have predicted that [over \$1.739 trillion dollars are spent
on military expenditure and arms worldwide]{.underline}. Thus, [the arms
trade has had a large effect on the world in different ways. This
exchange of arms and war material **increases the probability of
conflict**]{.underline} and can therefore be a threat to peace (SIPRI
Year Book 2018). **[The transfer of important qualities of arms and war
material had increased the possibilities of conflict and is therefore a
threat to peace.]{.underline}** In addition, the arms trade has
sometimes prolonged and sustained wars, for example that of the Iran/
Iraq conflict.

[The Iraq and Iran war]{.underline} in September 1980 lasted for 8
years. This war [accumulated huge amount of money mainly due to the
expenditure used in arms and man power. The war had over 500,000
casualties]{.underline}. To kill that many people, both sides had spent
around \$500,000 billion dollars, a substantial proportion of this on
weapons, in what was the single largest bonanza for freelance arms
dealers seen anywhere in the world at any time (Adams, 1992).

In this case, **[the arms trade had maintained this war which would have
ended a lot sooner. But instead it because so gruesome that it resulted
in many deaths, destroyed the infrastructure and environment of the
countries]{.underline}**. [The]{.underline} arms [trade eventually led
certain countries into very expensive arms race. It can be stated that
the arms trade can reduce the chance of political conflicts being
resolved peacefully and successfully.]{.underline}

[The resulting arms competition increase political tension]{.underline}.
In extreme circumstances, one of the nations may conclude that war is
inevitable, that the balance of power is likely to worsen in the future,
and that it should take pre-emptive military action to remove the threat
poised against it. For example: that of Pakistan and India. Pakistan had
purchased some expensive fighter aircraft (F-16s) from the USA in the
early 1980s and therefore had qualitatively improved its air forces
offensive capabilities. In return India bought advanced fighter aircraft
from France (Mirage 2000s) and Russia (Mig-29s) in order to counter
Pakistan. Also in other defence related areas, each side continued
buying advanced and therefore very expensive systems. From tanks,
ballistic missiles and eventually to nuclear weapons and despite this,
still both countries were buying more firepower --- [the acquisition of
further arms was actually undermining their security]{.underline}. It
was really to all intents and purposes making them more insecure. **[The
insecurity that had resulted could on the balance of probabilities lead
to a potential war with terrible devastation]{.underline}** for both
countries. **[All of this was a result of the arms trade]{.underline}**
(Cordesman, 1988). All of this was a result of the arms trade.

Both of the above countries are very poor and experience many domestic
problems. [Poverty, child labour, homelessness are a few serious issues
internally for both countries. **The money they spend in arms could be
utilised to improve the conditions of its people, and try and eradicate
poverty and diseases, provide education and have adequate health
facilities for its people.**]{.underline}

Some countries have supplied arms in a bid to become friendly with other
governments, so that it becomes hostile towards the supplier and
therefore the weapons it sold being used against it. For example: that
of the United Kingdom and Argentina. The Falklands war, showed that the
weapons the UK had supplied were used against it, inflicting many
casualties over it (Freedman, 1985).

**[The arms trade has]{.underline}** also **[proved that it can support
and intensify conflicts due to different groups support for the war such
as Vietnam War]{.underline}** (supplied by America on the one side and
Russia on the other side), **[the Arab/lsraeli conflict, Gulf wars, and
wars in Africa, South America and Asia]{.underline}** (Freedman, 1985).
[**Resulting with millions of death and vast damage to the environment,
destruction of cities. Causing poverty, hunger, hunger related diseases,
refugees etc.**]{.underline}

It can be stated that the arms trade has affected governments in that it
has stimulated and indirectly persuading them to spend more money on
buying arms, rather than spending that money to improve the quality of
life of its people (Freedman, 1985).

[The arms trade]{.underline} is such that it [has become a mechanism to
spend more money to defend citizens against a possible attack, **rather
than spending money against everyday ravages of poverty, life
threatening diseases, and social issues such as employment in many
countries.**]{.underline} [The arms trade diverts funds from addressing
current needs but it has a long term effect on issues like productivity
in civilian industries, price hikes, a slowing economy etc]{.underline}.
It can be concluded that [the arms trade has become a mechanism to
divert vital funds from significant issues such as poverty and
hunger.]{.underline} Hunger has a detrimental effect and many countries
currently are facing huge problems. [According to]{.underline} some
sources [(WHO)]{.underline} [**over 800 million individuals are
chronically undernourished, and face a long and gruelling death. Death
related to hunger and starvation average 50,000 a day.** In Africa
alone, 5 million children died from hunger-related causes.]{.underline}

#### Ongoing conflicts should be prioritized -- we should focus on what is happening [rather than what could]{.underline}

[The number of deaths, refugees and internally displaced people due to
the conflicts and civil wars in Africa is astounding.]{.underline} If
these statistics were **[scaled down to proportion and occurred in
Europe, the situation would be called World War III by the
media]{.underline}**. [The rest of the world would rush to defuse and
mediate the situation, and the mainstream Western media would provide
in-depth coverage. In terms of numbers of people who have been displaced
and killed]{.underline}, Africa has been largely ignored by the media
when compared to the coverage of fomenting tensions and following crises
of geographical locations like Palestine and Israel, Iraq and Kosovo.

In one study, [it was shown that 88 percent of the conflict-related
deaths occur in Africa]{.underline}, but it did not even figure into 10
percent of the coverage by mainstream Western media outlets. The study's
author, Virgil Hawkins, is a former NGO worker in Asia and Africa and a
current associate professor at the Osaka School of International Public
Policy, as well as a research associate at the University of the Free
State, South Africa. In Hawkins' book Stealth Conflicts: How the World's
Worst Violence Is Ignored, he declares it his mission "**[to shed light
on...the mechanisms that are behind \[these conflicts'\]
marginalization."]{.underline}**

AfricaThe book features a set of maps called New World Maps that are
designed to give readers a "[fresh perspective on the way things are,
and the way they are shown to us]{.underline}." **[They use
conflict-related deaths as the parameter for size]{.underline}**. Other
maps depict the way various media outlets (CNN, BBC, New York Times, Le
Monde, Yomiuri) perceive the world. Hawkins notes that [the purpose of
these maps is "not to suggest that levels of media coverage should be
proportionate to the...sheer scale of a conflict (death
toll)]{.underline}," although she says they should certainly be a
factor.

Why is the media coverage, for example, of [conflicts in Nigeria and the
Central African Republic important to countries in the West that do not
appear to be involved in them]{.underline}? Anup Shah, author and owner
of the Global Issues website, offers some answers to that question.
**[Shah points out that simplistic views, at worst, are racist, whether
intentional or not, and at best, offer no platform on how to move
forward.]{.underline}**

[Hawkins says his research led him to the quick and obvious fact that
those conflicts that have dominated the agendas of people in a position
to respond--such as policymakers, the public, the media, and
academia--are often small in scale in comparison to many of those that
have consistently failed to attract attention]{.underline}. The issues
need to be put in front of people who are, as Hawkins says, "in a
position to respond." [Countries such as those in the West have direct
and indirect influence when it comes to international
affairs]{.underline}. And finally, the opposite is just as true--all
countries have direct and indirect effects on all other countries. To
understand this best, Shah provides a quotation from J. Brian Atwood,
the former head of U.S. foreign aid policy: "Failed states threaten our
nation. They cost us too much...They destabilize other nations.
They...deny us economic opportunity in the largest new marketplace ---
the developing world."

**[The media tends to ignore the conflicts in Africa or oversimplify
them]{.underline}**. Provocative images abound, but conflict analysis is
[lacking. There is little understanding how monetary aid both helps and
hinders Africa, and the issue is not being addressed enough by
mainstream Western media, nor are the reasons for Africa's exportation
of crops despite its persistent famine and hunger]{.underline}. As
Hawkins says, "**[The marginalization of these conflicts is the result
of a series of deliberate choices on the part of those in a position to
respond.]{.underline}**" The media, in large part, [chooses to respond
inadequately to the conflict in Africa. In turn, its response affects
the present and future of those conflicts.]{.underline}

#### Defenses of arms sales rely on academically disproven statements \-\-- lobbyists do everything in their power to distort the truth so [public debates]{.underline} about arms sales are critical to pierce the secrecy that shrouds the military-industrial-complex

**Castagno, MA in International Conflict Resolution, 19** (2/20/19,

Accessed: 6-24-2019 //GBS Rudolph)

[**The revolving door between public officials and defense contractors
has long distorted U.S. foreign policy to serve war profiteers at the
expense of the public interest and basic humanitarian norms.** From U.S.
weaponry ending up in the hands of ISIS, to supplying arms fueling civil
conflict and therefore contributing to the world's worst humanitarian
catastrophe in Yemen,]{.underline} **[the lack of oversight on arms
deals has enabled human rights atrocities]{.underline}**.

The global arms trade is experiencing its greatest boom since the Cold
War, fueled by horrific wars in the Middle East and revitalized power
rivalries among China, Russia and the United States. In their most
recent report, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
revealed a 44 percent increase in arms sales from 2002 to 2017.
[The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [is
the world's biggest arms exporter by far, holding 34 percent of total
market share]{.underline} --- a 58 percent lead on Russia, its closest
competitor. From 2017 to 2018, U.S. arms sales to foreign governments
[increased 33 percent, in part due to]{.underline} the
**[Trump]{.underline}** administration**['s]{.underline}** **[diminished
legal restraints on supplying foreign militias]{.underline}**.

"\[T\]he people that are making these deals for the government, they
should never be allowed to go to work for these companies," President
Trump said during an interview with "Fox News Sunday" in December 2016.
"You, know, they make a deal like that and then a year later, or two
years later, or three years later you see them working for these big
companies that made the deal."

Before entering the White House, Trump asserted his belief in a
"lifetime restriction" on top defense officials working for private
defense contractors after their public service. Two years later, the
Project on Government Oversight released a detailed analysis of the
defense sector, revealing 645 instances of federal employees working for
the 20 largest Pentagon contractors in fiscal year 2016, the latest year
with complete data. Of the 645 instances of former public servants
transitioning to work for private defense corporations, 90 percent were
hired to work as lobbyists, where they seek to influence public policy
to benefit their private employers.

[Trump Cabinet Conflicts]{.underline}

[After the resignation of]{.underline} Gen. James [Mattis, Deputy
Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan filled the post]{.underline} as
interim head of the Defense Department. [Before joining the]{.underline}
Trump **[administration, Shanahan spent three decades working for Boeing
--- a blatant conflict of interest for the person responsible for
overseeing federal contracts with private defense
contractors]{.underline}**. [Col.]{.underline} Lawrence
[Wilkerson]{.underline}, Colin Powell's former chief of staff, **[called
Shanahan "a living, breathing product of the military-industrial
complex,"]{.underline}** and asserted that **["this revolving door keeps
the national security elite very small, and very wealthy, and increasing
its wealth as it goes up the chain."]{.underline}**

One egregious example of that revolving door is Heather Wilson, who has
been secretary of the Air Force since 2017. In 2015, Lockheed Martin
paid a \$4.7 million settlement to the Department of Justice after the
revelation it had used taxpayer funds to hire lobbyists for a \$2.4
billion contract. One of the lobbyists was former New Mexico
Representative Wilson, ranked as one of the "most corrupt members of
Congress" by the nonprofit government watchdog group Citizens for
Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Wilson was later confirmed as
Air Force secretary in the Senate by a 76-22 vote.

Mark T. **[Esper, the secretary of the Army, worked as vice president of
government relations for Raytheon before joining the Trump
administration in 2017]{.underline}**. The Hill recognized Esper as one
of Washington's most powerful corporate lobbyists in 2015 and 2016,
where he fought to influence acquisition policy and other areas of
defense bills. Esper's undersecretary, Ryan McCarthy, is a former
Lockheed executive.

Armament Industry's Influence on Foreign Policy

The Trump administration's commitment to advancing arms sales is not
only apparent in the legion of officials with severe conflicts of
interests occupying the cabinet, but also through directives in official
arms export policy. [The State Department's updated Conventional Arms
Transfer]{.underline} (CAT) [Policy Implementation Plan]{.underline} was
[released in November 2018]{.underline} and detailed loosened
restrictions on the sale of drones and other weapons, new financing
options for countries who can't afford U.S. weaponry, and aims to put
pressure on diplomats to put arms deals at the forefront of their
mission. Rachel Stohl, an arms trade expert with the Stimson Center,
described the updated policy, saying, "If you read between the lines,
**[it could be a green light for the U.S. to sell more with less
restraint."]{.underline}**

[A glaring example of the arms industry's influence on State Department
policy is demonstrated by]{.underline} a September 20, 2018, [report
from The Wall Street Journal]{.underline}. According to the report,
[Secretary of State]{.underline} Mike [Pompeo was convinced to continue
support for the Saudi campaign in Yemen for the sake of a \$2 billion
arms deal with U.S.-based defense contractor Raytheon. **The State
Department's legislative affairs staff, who influenced Pompeo's
decision, is led by Assistant Secretary of State**]{.underline} Charles
[**Faulkner, a former Raytheon lobbyist**.]{.underline}

Recent developments by the Trump administration have clarified the
nature of the relationship between defense contractors and the federal
government, but it would be erroneous to place the majority of the blame
on him for the greater trend in global arms sales. Under President
Barack Obama, arms exports doubled compared to President George W. Bush,
reaching more than \$200 billion in total approved deals (approved deals
don't represent actualized contracts, as deals can take years to be
ordered and completed). The rapid increase in exports was part of a
broader strategy to replace U.S. soldiers with surrogates in allied
countries, as well as to placate allies in Israel, Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) --- countries incensed by the
administration's nuclear deal with Iran.

[Despite brokering more arms deals than any administration since World
War II]{.underline}, President [**Obama did enforce holds on arms
exports to some countries deemed guilty of human rights abuses**,
including Bahrain, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. **[All of
these holds were lifted shortly after]{.underline}** the
**[Trump]{.underline}** administration **[took power]{.underline}**.

The Trump administration's priorities on arms sales were further
demonstrated after the CIA confirmed Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin
Salman's role in ordering the savage execution of journalist Jamal
Khashoggi. President Trump resisted calls to punish the Saudi prince on
the grounds that punitive action would jeopardize lucrative arms deals
with the kingdom. President Trump's claims vastly overstated the amount
of jobs and money to be lost if the U.S. withdrew support for Saudi
military adventurism.

Realigning US Priorities

Research from Brown University shows domestic investment in education
and health care creates more than twice as many jobs as military
spending. Trump's argument that we have to provide Saudi Arabia or the
UAE with bombs that land on school buses, hospitals and weddings in
order to preserve jobs is unconscionable and demonstrates a warped sense
of priorities. We don't have to contribute to what a United Nations
Children's Fund official has labeled a "war on children" to maintain
what accumulates to a total of less than 0.5 percent of U.S. jobs. We
can invest in productive sectors of the economy like renewable energy
and create jobs that truly serve our society.

**[A real debate on the arms trade is nearly absent from public
conversation because the industry can only thrive in secrecy and
duplicity.]{.underline}** Consider former House Speaker Paul Ryan's
final move as a public official, in which he snuck a provision to
curtail debate on Saudi support in Yemen into the U.S. farm bill in
December.

Fortunately, Ryan's manipulative tactics would fail to prevent the House
from finally passing a resolution to end U.S. support for the war in
Yemen on February 13. [Trump has indicated the Yemen resolution will be
his first veto, as it represents a]{.underline} major check to executive
power and a direct [rebuke to his arms export-based style of
diplomacy]{.underline}.

After Trump pulled out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,
commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal, defense companies enjoyed an
immediate boost to their stock. This is because demand in the arms trade
surges alongside geopolitical instability. Heightened volatility
encourages higher arms sales, and the dissemination of weapons to
despotic regimes increases volatility, creating a vicious cycle further
entrenched by a revolving door of defense contractors who influence
public policy to benefit private weapons manufacturers.

In his famous farewell speech, President Dwight [Eisenhower warned the
U.S. public of this exact predicament, what he called the
"military-industrial complex."]{.underline} President [Eisenhower's
warning remains prescient nearly 60 years later, as the failure to
regulate the defense sector has led the U.S. to arm its enemies, enable
humanitarian crises and desecrate its values.]{.underline} While the
historic House resolution to end U.S. support for the war in Yemen is
proof we can take concrete action to confront the military industrial
complex, **[greater public awareness is needed to transform U.S. foreign
policy in a profound manner]{.underline}**. Just as President Eisenhower
suggested, **[it is time for an alert and knowledgeable citizenry to
challenge the reasoning behind the U.S.'s endless wars and fight for a
more peaceful future]{.underline}**.

#### Arms suspensions are [powerful signaling mechanisms]{.underline} \-\-- they change countries' behavior by conveying U.S. dissatisfaction and building a coalition for a more expansive embargo

Governance and Policy Center (5/14/19, Jennifer, "The Case for
Suspending American Arms Sales to Saudi Arabia,"

accessed on 5/27/19, JMP)

[Arms embargos are often dismissed as symbolic, and therefore
ineffective.]{.underline} But just because something is symbolic,
doesn't mean that it won't have an effect. **[A U.S. arms embargo
against Saudi Arabia would be a clear signal of American disproval of
Saudi actions in Yemen, and would be an equally important signal
to]{.underline}** Washington's **[allies, who are left wondering if
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[is ambivalent or uninterested in the growing Yemeni humanitarian
catastrophe]{.underline}**.

[By continuing to provide weapons]{.underline}, President Donald [Trump
tacitly endorses Saudi policies]{.underline}. This signal is
strengthened by Trump's recent veto of the resolution that called for an
end to U.S. support for the war in Yemen. While Trump justified the veto
by saying that the resolution was a "dangerous attempt to weaken my
constitutional authorities," statements from Congressional
representatives show they are aware of the powerful signals sent by arms
sales. Sen. Tim Kaine said that the veto "shows the world \[Trump\] is
determined to keep aiding a Saudi-backed war that has killed thousands
of civilians and pushed millions more to the brink of starvation." **[An
arms embargo against Saudi Arabia would be a signal both to leaders of
that country, and other states, that the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[does not endorse
Saudi actions]{.underline}**. Those arguing against a ban are correct on
one point: [Embargos as blunt force instruments of coercion are rarely
effective. But **arms embargos are effective as signals of political
dissatisfaction, and serve an important communication role in
international politics**]{.underline}.

Arms Embargos Are Signals and Can Build Coalitions

Policymakers and scholars agree that arms embargoes are not effective
"sticks" in international politics. Rarely do states cave when faced
with punishment in the form of an embargo. But even if an arms embargo
isn't a direct tool of coercion, **[an embargo would be an important
political signal]{.underline}**. There are at least two reasons for the
United States to seriously consider an arms embargo against Saudi
Arabia.

First, **[arms sales are signals that cut through the noise of the
international system]{.underline}**. [Cutting off arms transfers is a
common way that states express their dissatisfaction with others and try
to influence behavior]{.underline}. [As]{.underline} Lawrence [Freedman
observed]{.underline} in 1978, ["refusing to sell arms is a major
political act. It appears as a calculated insult, reflecting on the
stability, trust, and credit-worthiness, or technical competence of the
would-be recipient."]{.underline} Yet this crucial point seems to have
been lost in the current policy debate about whether or not the United
States should continue selling arms to Saudi Arabia. **[My research
shows that stopping arms transfers or denying requests is an effective
way to signal dissatisfaction and causes the would-be recipient to
re-think their behavior]{.underline}**.

Take, for example, the U.S. relationship with Israel in the 1960s. The
United States sold Israel Hawk surface-to-surface missiles in 1962, M-48
Patton tanks in 1964 and 1965, and A-4E Skyhawk bombers in 1966. Israeli
leaders understood that these transfers signaled a close U.S.-Israeli
relationship. As diplomat Abba Eban wrote, the arms transfers were "a
development of tremendous political value." Even against this backdrop
of close ties and significant arms sales, Israeli leaders were extremely
sensitive to arms transfer denials. In April and May 1967, the United
States denied Israeli requests for armored personnel carriers and
fighter jets. Approving the transfers would have signaled support, and
likely emboldened Israel, as tensions were growing in the region.
Israeli leaders believed these transfer denials overruled prior signals
and demonstrated that the United States was not willing to be a close
political ally for Israel. Eban described Israel as "isolated," and the
head of Israel's intelligence service said that the arms transfer
denials made it clear that "in Israel, there existed certain
misperceptions \[about the United States\]." [If arms transfer denials
could have]{.underline} such [a significant effect on Israeli
thinking]{.underline} --- keeping in mind that there was a close and
significant political relationship between the US and Israel ---
[imagine what a transfer denial would mean for U.S.-Saudi
relations]{.underline}. Like Israel, **[Saudi Arabia would have to
re-think its impression that it has political support and approval from
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. We
can, and should, ask whether or not withdrawal of U.S. support would
affect Saudi behavior, but it's important that this question not get
overlooked in the current debate.

**[Because arms transfers (and denials) are powerful signals, they can
have an effect even before a transfer is actually
completed.]{.underline}** This suggests that **[even the announcement of
an embargo against Saudi Arabia could have an effect]{.underline}**.
Take, for example, Taiwan's recent request for a fleet of new fighter
jets. As reports mounted that Trump had given "tacit approval" to a deal
for F-16 jets, China's protests increased. The United States has not
sold advanced fighter jets to Taiwan since 1992, partially out of fear
of angering China, which views Taiwan as a renegade province. Even if
the deal for F-16s is formally approved, Taiwan is unlikely to see the
jets until at least 2021, and the balance of power between China and
Taiwan would not change. As one researcher observed, the sale would be a
"huge shock" for Beijing, "But it would be more of a political shock
than a military shock. It would be, 'Oh, the U.S. doesn't care how we
feel.' It would be more of a symbolic or emotional issue." Yet China's
immediate, negative reaction to even the announcement of a potential
deal shows how powerful arms transfer signals can be.

If this same logic is applied to an arms embargo against Saudi Arabia,
**[an arms embargo would signal that Saudi Arabia does not have the
support of the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. **[This signal would be an important first
step in changing Saudi behavior because it would override other
statements and actions the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[has sent that indicate
support]{.underline}**. And [Trump has given Saudi Arabia a number of
positive signals]{.underline}: He called Saudi Arabia a "great ally" and
dismissed reports that that the Saudi government was involved in the
murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. He has expressed interested in
selling nuclear power plants and technology to Saudi Arabia. And he has
repeatedly claimed that he has made a \$110 billion arms deal with Saudi
Arabia (he hasn't). With these clear signals of support, why should
Saudi Arabia alter its behavior based on resolutions that come out of
the House or Senate, which are likely to be vetoed by Trump, anyway?
**[An arms embargo would be a clear and unambiguous signal that
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[disproves of Saudi actions in Yemen]{.underline}**.

The second reason for supporting an embargo concerns U.S. allies and the
logistical difficulties of making an embargo have an effect. [One of the
reasons embargoes have little material impact is because they require
cooperation among weapons exporting states. A ban on sales from one
country will have little effect if the target of the embargo can seek
arms elsewhere.]{.underline} Germany, instituted an arms ban against
Riyadh in November 2018, and German leaders have pressured other
European states to stop selling arms to the Saudis. Germany understands
the importance of the embargo as a political signal: as a representative
of the German Green Party explained, "The re-start of arms exports to
Saudi Arabia would be a fatal foreign policy signal and would contribute
to the continued destabilization of the Middle East." But the German
embargo has had minimal effect because Saudi Arabia can get arms
elsewhere.

According to the 2019 Military Balance, **[most of Saudi Arabia's
equipment is American or French in origin]{.underline}**, such as the
M1A2 Abrams and AMX-30 tanks, Apache and Dauphin helicopters, and
F-15C/D fighter jets. [Saudi Arabia has some equipment manufactured
wholly or in part in Germany]{.underline}, such as the Eurofighter
Typhoon and the Tornado ground attack craft, [but these weapons are a
small portion of its complete arsenal]{.underline}. **[A U.S. embargo
would send an important signal to the allies who also supply Saudi
Arabia, allowing them to explain participation in the embargo to their
own domestic constituencies.]{.underline}** [This is especially
important for countries like France, Germany, and the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[K]{.underline}**ingdom, [that need to export
arms to keep their own production lines running]{.underline}. While the
research shows that sustaining an arms embargo is often the most
difficult step, embargoes can restrain sending states' arms exports.
**[Even if a U.S. embargo won't have a direct effect on Saudi Arabia on
its own, an embargo is important for building coalitions for a more
expansive embargo that could affect Saudi behavior.]{.underline}**

The Difficulty of Stopping Atrocities

Beyond signaling, we know [U.S. arms sales often end up in the wrong
hands, and have been used in Yemen]{.underline}. [The Saudi-led war in
Yemen has led to starvation conditions, caused thousands of civilian
casualties, and has led to the displacement of millions of
people.]{.underline} The United Nations estimates that 80 percent of
Yemen's population -- 24 million people -- require some form of
humanitarian or protection assistance, and that the severity of the
situation is increasing. Would an arms embargo create meaningful change
in Yemen?

**[An initial effect of an embargo is that Saudi Arabia would have to
work harder to access war materiel.]{.underline}** As Jonathan Caverley
noted, **[more than 60 percent of Saudi Arabia's arms delivered in the
past five years came from the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. Even if this percentage decreases over time,
**[it will be costly for Saudi Arabia to transition to a primarily
Russian- or Chinese-supplied military]{.underline}**. Though Saudi
Arabia might be willing to pay this cost, it would still have to pay,
and take **[the time to transition to its new weapons
systems]{.underline}**. This **[would represent a brief break in
hostilities that could facilitate the delivery of aid and assistance in
Yemen]{.underline}**.

The United States could, in theory, impose stricter end-user controls on
Saudi Arabia. This would have the advantage of keeping Saudi Arabia
within the world of U.S. weapons systems, and might prevent it from
diversifying its suppliers, which would ultimately weaken any leverage
the United States might have. Longer-term, it would not be to America's
advantage if Saudi Arabia takes a lesson from Turkey, and starts
courting Russia as a new arms supplier. It is difficult to enforce
end-user controls, since, once a weapon is transferred, the recipient
can use it however it wishes. It might also be the case that Saudi
Arabia would object to stricter end-user controls, and would seek new
suppliers as a result.

An arms embargo will not be a panacea. But [**not doing something sets a
problematic precedent**, and allows the difficulty of coordinating an
arms embargo outweigh the potential benefits of one]{.underline}. An
embargo is unlikely to have an immediate effect on Saudi behavior,
because an embargo would be a political signal, rather than a blunt
instrument of coercion. [It will take time for a multilateral embargo to
emerge and be put into place, and the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [should work with its
allies to help support their ability to participate in the
embargo]{.underline}. **[Not acting]{.underline}**, however, **[would
continue to implicitly endorse Saudi behavior, and would make it more
difficult for U.S. allies to believe that future threats of an embargo
are credible]{.underline}**.

accessed on 4/30/19, JMP)

The Case for a New Approach

So far we have argued that arms sales lack a compelling strategic
justification, amplify risks, and generate a host of unintended negative
consequences. These factors alone argue for significantly curtailing the
arms trade. But the case for doing so is made even stronger by the fact
that [greatly reducing arms sales would]{.underline} also
[produce]{.underline} two significant benefits for the United States
that cannot otherwise be enjoyed.

The first benefit from reducing arms sales would be **[greater
diplomatic flexibility and leverage]{.underline}**. [Critics might argue
that even if arms sales are an imperfect tool, forgoing arms sales will
eliminate a potential source of leverage.]{.underline} We argue that,
**[on the contrary, the diplomatic gains from forgoing arms sales will
outweigh the potential leverage or other benefits from arms
sales]{.underline}**. Most importantly, [by refraining from arming
nations engaged in conflict, the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [will have the diplomatic flexibility to engage
with all parties as an honest broker]{.underline}. The inherent
difficulty of negotiating while arming one side is obvious today with
respect to North and South Korea. After decades of U.S. support for
South Korea, North Korea clearly does not trust the United States.
Similarly, U.S. attempts to help negotiate a peace deal between the
Israelis and Palestinians have long been complicated by American support
for Israel. [To stop arming one side of a contentious relationship is
not to suggest that the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [does not have a preferred outcome]{.underline}
in such cases. Rather, **[by staying out of the military domain
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[can more readily encourage dialogue and diplomacy]{.underline}**.

Forgoing arms sales is likely to be a superior strategy even in cases
where the United States has an entrenched interest. In the case of
Taiwan, for example, though it is clear that Taiwan needs to purchase
weapons from other countries to provide for its defense, those weapons
do not have to be made in the United States. Having Taiwan buy from
other suppliers would help defuse U.S.-China tensions. Even if Taiwan's
defenses remained robust, China would clearly prefer a situation in
which American arms no longer signal an implicit promise to fight on
Taiwan's behalf. This could also promote more productive U.S.-China
diplomacy in general, as well as greater stability in the Pacific
region. Most important, breaking off arms sales would also reduce the
likelihood of the United States becoming entangled in a future conflict
between Taiwan and China.

The second major benefit of **[reducing arms sales]{.underline}** is
that it **[would imbue the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[with greater moral authority]{.underline}**.
Today, [as the leading arms-dealing nation in the world,
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[lacks credibility in discussions of arms control and
nonproliferation]{.underline}, especially in light of its military
interventionism since 2001. [By showing the world that it is ready to
choose diplomacy over the arms trade, the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [would provide a huge
boost to international efforts to curtail proliferation]{.underline} and
its negative consequences. This is important because the United States
has pursued and will continue to pursue a wide range of arms control and
nonproliferation objectives. The United States is a signatory of
treaties dealing with weapons of mass destruction, missile technology,
land mines, and cluster munitions, not to mention the flow of
conventional weapons of all kinds. **[The effectiveness
of]{.underline}** these **[treaties, and the ability to create more
effective and enduring arms control and nonproliferation
frameworks]{.underline}**, however, **[depends on how the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[behaves]{.underline}**.

This is not to say that unilateral American action will put an end to
the problems of the global arms trade. States would still seek to ensure
their security and survival through deterrence and military strength.
Other weapons suppliers would, in the short run, certainly race to meet
the demand. But [history shows that global nonproliferation treaties and
weapons bans typically **require great-power support**]{.underline}. In
1969, for example, Richard [Nixon decided to shutter the American
offensive-biological-weapons program and seek an international
ban]{.underline} on such weapons. [By 1972 the]{.underline}
**[B]{.underline}**iological **[W]{.underline}**eapons
**[C]{.underline}**onvention [passed and has since been signed by 178
nations]{.underline}.98 In 1991 President George H. W. [Bush
unilaterally renounced the use of chemical weapons]{.underline}.
[By]{.underline} 19[93]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [had signed
the]{.underline} **[C]{.underline}**hemical **[W]{.underline}**eapons
**[C]{.underline}**onvention, which now has 192 signatories.99 [Both of
these]{.underline} efforts [succeeded in part because the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[took decisive early
action in the absence of any promises about how others would
respond]{.underline}**.100 [Without U.S. leadership, any effort to limit
proliferation of major conventional weapons and dangerous emerging
technologies is likely to fail.]{.underline}

### 1ac LIO Advantage

#### Contention 2 is the Liberal Order

#### Trump's arms sales policy is rooted in his [transactional]{.underline} foreign policy \-\-- [each sale]{.underline} [signals]{.underline} to the world that liberal ideals like [human rights don't matter]{.underline}

**Abramson, 18** \-\-- nonresident senior fellow for arms control and
conventional arms transfers at the Arms Control Association (8/8/18,
Jeff, "U.S. Arms Transfer Policy: Shaping the Way Ahead,"
<https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-arms-transfer-policy-shaping-way-ahead>,
accessed on 6/5/19, JMP)

Now, [every Conventional Arms Transfer Policy is kind of a word
soup]{.underline}. You can find almost anything you want in there. And
as mentioned, the priorities there are not weighted, they're just
listed.

[I'm concerned that the optics and the reality of how this policy might
be implemented are looking at the wrong problem.]{.underline} So I just
want to frame a few things so that I can explain how I see this
differently, and then talk about how I think this matters to the world.

[There are some assumptions]{.underline} I'm hearing [that
I]{.underline} sort of [reject as a frame]{.underline}.
[One]{.underline}, that if others do it, [[if others]{.mark} are going
to [fill the gap]{.mark}, we have to fill it. **[I don't think
that's]{.mark} ever [a rationale for transferring]{.mark} what is not a
trade commodity. These are [weapons]{.mark}. These are killing
machines.**]{.underline} And it's easy to talk about them in the
abstract, but that is their purpose.

And in our economy, they aren't that huge a piece of our economy. [But
for those of us who care about it, **they have an outweighing impact on
our world**, our country and the world. And we never need to forget
that. And we can't talk about the arms trade as sort of an anodized,
clean system. It is dangerous.]{.underline} And I don't think we've
figured out exactly how to do it right over time.

And we can easily go through the litany of past arms transfers that
seemed to make sense that no longer do. And that's the problem, I think,
that [every conventional arms transfer policy should take at its
root]{.underline}, which is, [how do we make sure we do it
responsibly?]{.underline}

And I appreciated **[Ambassador Kaidanow]{.underline}**'s message that
we do want to continue to do this responsibly. And I do believe that is
what is in people's hearts. But as she **[said, [each delivery sends a
message]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And my concerns here are, **[when we
stress the economic side of this, that is what is seen]{.underline}**.

And [when]{.underline} President [Trump meets with the Saudis and holds
up posters of weapons and the amounts of sales, **[the message being
perceived]{.mark} [in the world is that]{.mark}**]{.underline} the
**[[human rights]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the other concerns, the
security, they **[[don't matter, it's a transactional approach]{.mark},
it's about faster and more]{.underline}**. **[And faster and more could
be a recipe for disaster.]{.underline}** These are some of the concerns
that are in -- that need to be taken into account.

There is this idea that the higher-technology weapons are the only ones
that matter, and so there's an export control reform process on
categories one to three of the USML, which was briefly mentioned, which
I find really alarming, the prospect that we'll be actually making it
much easier for semiautomatic weapons to go around the world. These are
often the weapons used in conflict. These are often the weapons that are
driving human rights abuses. The rationale that, well, these aren't
high-sophistication weapons so we don't need to pay as much attention is
driven from this idea that our approach needs to be more and faster and
we need to protect only the crown jewels, which is a continuation of the
Obama administration, but never got to these pieces. So there's all
these parts that are going on that I think are the wrong message.

And one of the other portions of this is, if we do want to create
responsibility -- and this is where I'll be interested and as we have
the panel to discuss this -- where there might be some overlaps. There's
a lot of discussion in here about timelines and milestones, right? I
mean, I understand industry is wont for that. I understand the idea that
you want to move faster.

A number of us have met with the people working on the policy and I
think most of us are disappointed that none of our suggestions about a
little bit more transparency in those timelines and milestones would be
helpful. I think industry would probably also support that.

I think also, if we're going to move faster and more, we need to have at
the tail end a better sense of how we're going to use end-use
restrictions and end-use monitoring. And we need to have better
transparency afterwards so we can test. And I appreciated Melissa
talking about there is a much greater push today to assess whether our
security assistance, our efforts are actually achieving the goals.

My concern is we're going to move faster and we're going to not improve
our transparency or our processes along the way such that we can assess
later whether this was an experiment that was worth taking.

I think it's also critical, as we mentioned, that along the process, if
there are these milestones, that those are insertion points where you
can reevaluate whether the deal that was made, however many months or
years ago, still makes sense. And a small piece of this could be
Congress gave itself the power to get a predelivery notification. It's
only used its power once in a Middle East sale, but this could be a
standard process. And it could be public similar to direct commercial
sales which get notified to Congress, but don't have the same website as
foreign military sales. Those could be made public at the same time.

My thinking here is that if we're going to do this, if this is the drive
for the administration to faster and more, that we need to have at the
same time a more transparent process and one that the public can engage
in a little bit more frequently. Because I think we are seeing,
interestingly in this new, first two years of the Trump administration,
Congress is paying a bit more attention. You have some holds right now
on some sales that have been really concerning that I thought were going
through on weapons to Saudi Arabia and the UAE on precision-guided
munitions. You have some holds on appointments and so on and so forth.
But Congress needs to step up its game, but it needs to be helped by the
public.

And I don't think that can be inconsistent, I think it could be worked
into the policy. But I think **[[the message of the policy]{.mark} is
not one that promotes international responsibility, but instead one that
[promotes transactions and sales, not human
rights]{.mark}.]{.underline}** And **[that is very
alarming.]{.underline}**

#### Transactionalism in the area of arms sales [saps U.S. authority]{.underline} to counter autocrats and check the slide toward authoritarianism globally

**Baker, 18** \-\-- chief White House correspondent for The New York
Times (10/14/18, Peter, "In Trump's Saudi Bargain, the Bottom Line
Proudly Wins Out,"
<https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/14/us/politics/trump-saudi-arabia-arms-deal.html>,
accessed on 5/28/19, JMP)

WASHINGTON --- [When]{.underline} President [Trump made Saudi Arabia his
first foreign destination after taking office]{.underline} last year,
[he struck]{.underline} what amounted [to a fundamental
bargain]{.underline} with the royal family: [He would not lecture them
about human rights, and they would buy plenty of American weapons and
military hardware]{.underline}.

So as the world recoils at reports that the Saudis sent agents to Turkey
to kill and dismember a Saudi dissident journalist with a bone saw, Mr.
Trump faces the most profound test of that trade-off. For days, he has
rebuffed pressure to punish the Saudis by canceling arms sales that he
secured during his visit, arguing that it would cost Americans money and
jobs.

That he would prioritize potentially tens of billions of dollars for the
United States over moral outrage about the apparent death of a single
dissident may not be a major surprise. [Other presidents have tempered
concerns about human rights overseas with what they perceived to be
America's own security or economic interests. **What is different is how
open**]{.underline} Mr. **[[Trump has been]{.mark} in
[expressing]{.mark} that [realpolitik calculation]{.mark} no matter how
crass or cynical it might appear]{.underline}**.

"Any president's going to be stuck in this awkward place," said Steven
A. Cook, a specialist on the region at the Council on Foreign Relations.
"The one thing about Trump is he's basically willing to say: 'I don't
really care. He's not an American citizen. Yes, it's terrible, but we've
got all this business with them.' He doesn't shy away from saying that."

But [that approach could put]{.underline} Mr. [Trump on a collision
course with Congress, where there is sentiment among members of both
parties to use the leverage of arms sales to send a message to Saudi
Arabia that it cannot get away with killing a journalist with American
ties on foreign soil]{.underline}.

Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said on Sunday that curbing
arms sales would be on the menu of possible responses if it is
determined that the Saudi government did kill the journalist, Jamal
Khashoggi, who lived in Virginia and wrote columns for The Washington
Post. Turkish officials have concluded that Mr. Khashoggi was murdered
as he visited the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago; the Saudi
government has rejected the accusations.

Mr. [Rubio said it was **important for the**]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[to have the [moral
authority to criticize autocrats like]{.mark}]{.underline}** President
Vladimir V. **[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Russia
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** President **[Bashar al-[Assad]{.mark} of
Syria]{.underline}**. **["All of that [is undermined]{.mark} and
compromised [if we]{.mark} somehow decide that because an ally who is
important did that [we're not going to call it
out,"]{.mark}]{.underline}** he said on "Meet the Press" on NBC.

"So I will just say this to you with full confidence: If this is proven
to be true, there is going to be a response from Congress," he went on.
"It's going to be nearly unanimous. It's going to be swift. And it's
going to go pretty far. And that could include arms sales. But it could
include a bunch of other things as well."

The Saudi government reacted harshly on Sunday to the specter of a
punitive American response, saying it would respond to any action "with
greater action," backed by its economic might.

The threat came in response to a promise Mr. Trump had made in an
interview on "60 Minutes" to exact "severe punishment" if the Saudis'
complicity in Mr. Khashoggi's apparent killing is demonstrated.

But the seriousness of his commitment to that vow was unclear. Asked by
reporters on Saturday what specifically he had in mind, he offered no
examples and instead asked a senator visiting the Oval Office for his
thoughts.

Mr. Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia in May 2017 was meant to be a signal
of his foreign policy priorities. He was hoping to realign the region by
rebuilding America's alliance with Riyadh, which had frayed under
President Barack Obama, and by making clear that he was getting the
United States out of the business of lecturing friends about domestic
matters.

"We are not here to tell other people how to live, what to do, who to be
or how to worship," he told the Saudis in a message heard elsewhere
around the world. Instead, he focused on the economic benefits of the
relationship, boasting that he had secured \$110 billion in arms sales
during his trip.

That figure, though, was wildly inflated and misleading. Mr. Trump's
package essentially consisted of letters of intent or interest, not
actual contracts, and the possible deals began in the Obama
administration, when the Saudis bought \$112 billion in aircraft,
missiles and other military equipment over eight years.

Seventeen months later, the Trump arms bonanza still has not
materialized. The kingdom has not bought any new arms platform during
the Trump administration, noted Bruce Riedel, a former C.I.A. official
and a Saudi expert at the Brookings Institution who advised the Obama
administration on Middle East policy.

The possible deal with the highest profile, a \$15 billion purchase of a
missile defense system known as Thaad, seems stalled as the Saudis let a
September deadline with Lockheed Martin pass, Mr. Riedel pointed out in
a paper last week.

Even so, Mr. Trump has remained committed, citing the package as a
signal accomplishment and explicitly rejecting any pause, much less
cancellation.

"I worked very hard to get the order for the military," he told
reporters on Saturday. "If they don't buy it from us, they're going to
buy it from Russia or they're going to buy it from China, or they're
going to buy it from other countries."

Mr. Trump has a point about competitors. As the Saudis hedge on Thaad,
they have been in talks with Russia for the purchase of its S-400 air
defense system. But more broadly, Saudi Arabia would find it hard to
switch wholesale to other arms suppliers. The Royal Saudi Air Force
depends on American and British support for its fleet of F-15 fighter
jets, Apache helicopters and Tornado aircraft, Mr. Riedel pointed out.
Its army is likewise dependent on Western parts and support.

But Mr. **[Trump's focus on the bottom line sends an unmistakable
message]{.underline}**. "**[[The president]{.mark}, through his
reluctance to scuttle the arms deal, [is telegraphing to authoritarian
regimes]{.mark} that [they can buy a pass on repressive, brutal measures
without]{.mark} incurring [consequences]{.mark} from the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates," [said]{.underline}
David J. [Kramer, an assistant secretary of state for human rights
under]{.underline} President George W. [Bush]{.underline} and now a
senior fellow at Florida International University.

Elisa [Massimino, former president of Human Rights First, an advocacy
group, said]{.underline} that every president had to navigate complex
relationships with allies, balancing sometimes competing interests, but
that Mr. **[Trump did not understand the [power]{.mark} that [came from
being clear about values]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

**["His short-term, [transactional approach not only undermines those
working for democratic change in their own countries, but robs
the]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[of key leverage on strategic
interests]{.mark} across the board,"]{.underline}** she said.

[Other presidents have continued arms sales to countries with loathsome
human rights records and, in moments like this one, tried to find ways
around cutting off such transactions.]{.underline} After Egypt's
military overthrew its elected president in 2013, Mr. Obama skirted a
law requiring the halt of military aid to countries that experience a
coup by refusing to declare whether the situation in Cairo amounted to
one.

He ultimately ordered a modest and temporary suspension of some military
aid, delaying delivery of F-16 aircraft, Harpoon missiles and M1A1
Abrams tanks, and then resumed them 17 months later.

**[But]{.underline}** Mr. **[[Trump's predecessors justified their
decisions]{.mark} to keep arms flowing to wayward allies [by warning
of]{.mark} the national [security implications of]{.mark}
[cut]{.mark}ting them [off]{.mark} --- [not by focusing on the financial
well-being of defense contractors]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Egypt and
Saudi Arabia are both important partners of the United States in
regional issues, particularly the fight against terrorism.

["What [Trump]{.mark} is doing here is not claiming that American
national security should weigh more heavily than our human rights
commitments]{.underline} --- an argument many Americans would accept,"
said Tamara Cofman Wittes, a State Department official under Mr. Obama
who is now at Brookings. ["Instead, **he [is claiming]{.mark} that
commercial transactions with private [American weapons manufacturers
should weigh more heavily than]{.mark} our [human rights]{.mark}
commitments, [because]{.mark} the spending produces
[jobs]{.mark}."**]{.underline}

#### Maintaining the [appearance]{.underline} of a values-based narrative on arms sales is vital to the [survival]{.underline} of the liberal international order

**Palacio, 18 -** Ana Palacio, a former Spanish foreign minister and
former Senior Vice President of the World Bank, is a member of the
Spanish Council of State, a visiting lecturer at Georgetown University
and a member of the World Economic Forumʹs Global Agenda Council on the
United States ("Did the global order die with Khashoggi?" Project
Syndicate, 10/29,
<https://en.qantara.de/content/trump-mbs-and-the-aftermath-did-the-global-order-die-with-khashoggi>

Principled leaders on the world stage need to reinforce the rules on
which we all depend, sending a clear signal that what happened in
Istanbul is not acceptable. Otherwise, we will effectively be giving up
the discourse of values and rules -- a decision that could well leave us
with no coherent and stabilising discourse at all, argues Ana Palacio

Earlier this month Jamal Khashoggi -- a Washington Post columnist and
prominent critic of the Saudi government -- walked into Saudi Arabiaʹs
consulate in Istanbul to pick up documents that would enable him to
marry his Turkish fiancee. Instead of receiving help from his countryʹs
government, he was tortured, murdered and dismembered by a team of its
agents.

It is a shocking crime that raises some serious questions, not least
regarding the appropriate balance between defending human rights and
maintaining long-standing (and lucrative) alliances. More fundamentally,
[the sheer brazenness with which the Saudi government had Khashoggi
killed]{.underline} -- not to mention Western leadersʹ weak response --
[has underscored for people around the world just how coldly calculated
geopolitical machinations really are.]{.underline}

Transparency is usually a virtue to be encouraged. Here, however, the
revelation comes at a cost. [[The belief that]{.mark} principles,
[values and rules hold]{.mark} at least some [weight]{.mark} in
international relations [has a stabilising effect]{.mark}. **[As that
belief is shaken]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- say, by the poisoning earlier
this year of the former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his
daughter on British soil -- **[[the global order is
damaged]{.underline}]{.mark}**, perhaps beyond repair.

Beware an absence of common values

The de-legitimising effect of such episodes is exacerbated by a broader
abandonment of formalities -- such as workplace dress codes and
standards for communication -- that has been fuelled by the rise of
social media. As our public and private lives are blurred, public
figures are under pressure to appear as \"real\" and \"normal\" as our
neighbours and colleagues.

Of course, not all of these shifts are necessarily bad. The breakdown of
formal structures can create space for independent thinking and
innovation. The danger comes when no new framework emerges to help guide
our behaviour -- and, more important, the behaviour of our leaders -- to
ensure that it adheres to some shared values or reasonable expectations.

U.S. President Donald Trump embodies this risk. Since coming onto the
political scene, Trump has shattered expectations about how a U.S.
presidential candidate -- and, subsequently, a U.S. president -- should
behave. While there is nothing fundamentally wrong with a political
leader communicating frankly and directly with his or her constituents,
the tone and style of Trumpʹs delivery -- largely via Twitter -- is
highly damaging.

His below-the-belt insults, racist dog whistles and unfounded attacks on
the media and other democratic institutions are deepening political and
social divisions, while diminishing respect for the presidency and the
U.S. more generally.

[Trumpʹs unprecedentedly transactional]{.underline} -- and highly
erratic -- [approach to foreign policy is]{.underline} similarly
[destabilising]{.underline}. To be sure, Trumpʹs deal-making was
initially framed to some extent by broader values, especially increasing
the \"fairness\" of U.S. relationships, from security co-operation with
NATO allies to trade ties with China. Despite Trumpʹs \"America first\"
rhetoric, such actions seemed to be focused more on rebalancing the
system than destroying it.

[[Trumpʹs response to the Khashoggi episode]{.underline}]{.mark},
however, [is fully decoupled from any overarching values]{.underline}.
To be clear, [U.S. presidents]{.underline}, together with European
leaders, [have been coddling Saudi Arabia for decades and leaders
worldwide often base their foreign-policy decisions on realpolitik,
rather than moral considerations.]{.underline}

But **[this is the first time a U.S. president [has unabashedly
acknowledged the purely transactional nature of their policy
decisions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The Saudis, Trump declares bluntly,
are \"spending \$110 billion on military equipment and on things that
create jobs\" in the United States. \"I donʹt like the concept of
stopping an investment of \$110 billion into the United States.\"

When life is cheap

Notwithstanding the dubiousness of the figures involved, [Trumpʹs
comments are a bald statement of monetised interest]{.underline}. The
comfort, even pride, with which he makes such statements indicates that
we really have entered a new era, in which we cannot expect our leaders
to clear even the low bar of trying to fit their decisions into **[[a
rules- or values-based narrative]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

This is dangerous, because such narratives [**[are vital to maintain the
credibility of the global order and]{.mark} the support of [domestic
constituencies]{.mark} for it**.]{.underline} [Just like effective
leadership and respect for the rule of law, a certain amount of [faith
in the system]{.mark}]{.underline} -- even if it is qualified by
frustration with inequality or impunity [-- [is **essential to its
survival**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

A world in which all that matters is the deal, in which there is no
ethos guiding our actions and underpinning our governance systems, is
one where citizens do not know what to expect from their leaders and
countries do not know what to expect from their allies. Such an
unpredictable and unstable world is not one that we should blindly
accept.

For more moral leadership

[It is not too late to respond to Khashoggiʹs brutal murder in a way
that reinforces, rather than undermines, the rules]{.underline} on which
we all depend. German Chancellor Angela [Merkelʹs [**suspension of arms
sales** to Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [is a good start]{.mark}]{.underline},
even if it was driven largely by her desire to shore up support for her
Christian Democratic Union ahead of regional elections in Hesse; so,
too, is the current push-back from Washington against a
business-as-usual approach to Saudi Arabia.

But more must be done, with principled leaders declaring clearly that
what happened in Istanbul is not acceptable. Otherwise, we will
effectively be giving up the discourse of values and rules -- a decision
that could well leave us with no coherent and stabilising discourse at
all.

#### This [U.S. policy tilt]{.underline} toward authoritarian states will [quickly finish off]{.underline} the liberal international order

WASHINGTON --- [Sometimes a particular event, the fate of a particular
individual, becomes a symbol of a global, historical trend.]{.underline}
[The]{.underline} reported [murder of]{.underline} the Saudi journalist
Jamal [[Khashoggi]{.underline}]{.mark}, a Washington Post contributor,
in a consulate in Istanbul is one of those moments. It
**[[symbolizes]{.mark} the [departure of the]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[as a restraining force]{.mark} against evil actors in the
world]{.underline}**.

Saudi Arabia is a small nation that cannot defend itself without the
support of the United States, and therefore [[no]{.underline}]{.mark}
Saudi **[[leader would have made such a brazen move without
confidence]{.mark} that [Washington]{.mark}, once the leader of the
liberal world order, [would do nothing]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

There have been many other similar warning signs: China's arrest of the
head of Interpol; Myanmar's military campaign of genocide against the
Rohingya; the systematic and deliberate slaughter of civilians in Syria,
including by outlawed chemical weapons; the Russian invasion of Ukraine
and seizure of Crimea.

Nor are the rise of right-wing nationalist forces in Europe and
elsewhere unrelated to the loss of strength and vitality among the
democratic nations. **[Doubts about America have been reverberating
across the globe for more than a decade, and others have been responding
accordingly.]{.underline}**

When Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban spoke out to celebrate the
"illiberal state" a few years ago, he claimed he was only responding to
new realities: "the great redistribution of global financial, economic,
commercial, political and military power that became obvious in 2008."

So [welcome to the breakdown of the liberal world order the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [once upheld. You're
seeing just the beginning]{.underline}.

[World order is one of those things people don't think about until it is
gone.]{.underline} That's what Americans learned in the 1930s, as what
had remained of the old European order collapsed and the United States
refused to step in either to prop it up or to replace it. That's when
[Americans discovered that there are always dangerous people out there,
lacking only the power and opportunity to achieve their destiny. They
can be suppressed by a reasonably stable international
order]{.underline}, whether of a Rome, a united Christendom, a European
concert of powers, or whatever might pass for "civilization" at a given
time and place.

During such times, [they live under the rocks, but they are never gone.
When the prevailing order breaks down, when the rocks are overturned,
the things living beneath them, the darkest elements of the human
spirit, crawl out.]{.underline} That was what happened in the first half
of the 20th century. The circumstances in which **[Hitler, Stalin and
Mussolini rose to power]{.underline}** gave them ample opportunity to
show what they were capable of. **[[Had there been an order]{.mark} in
place [to blunt those ambitions, we might never have come to know them
as]{.mark} tyrants, [aggressors and mass killers.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[Today the rocks are being overturned again.]{.underline}** [Those who
have been arguing that we should pull back from the world and show
greater restraint tell us we need to accept the world "as it is." But
they have no idea what the world "as it is" really looks like. They grew
up inside the bubble of protection provided by U.S. power and the
liberal world order it sustained]{.underline}, a world in which other
nations were forced to adjust their behavior to those realities of
power.

**[[Russian behavior was shaped by what]{.mark} Russian [leaders
believed the]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[would]{.mark} or had to [tolerate,
as well as]{.mark} by [their sense of the liberal order's
strength]{.mark} and cohesion.]{.underline}** **[[The same was true of
China]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s behavior, and
**[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s, and **[[Saudi]{.mark}

differently if America had]{.mark} behaved differently, [and so

world]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

We want to believe that Hitler and Stalin were bizarre products of
another era. But **[the Hitlers and Stalins are all around us, waiting
to reveal themselves if given half a chance.]{.underline}** Today we
know a Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} who [has grand ambitions but not yet
the capacity to realize them. He reveres Stalin]{.underline}, but he is
not Stalin. But [what would a less constrained Putin be?]{.underline}

Today a more powerful [[China is abandoning]{.mark} the [cautious
foreign policies]{.mark}]{.underline} of Deng Xiaoping's weaker China.
What will an even less constrained China be like? [Who can say whether
either of these powers might in time become a threat on a par with those
we faced in the past if they are allowed to expand their regional and
global influence by military means?]{.underline}

And **[how quickly might this happen? Quicker than we

asked how he went bankrupt, responds, **["[Gradually]{.mark} and then

[The liberal world order is under assault]{.underline}. Polls suggest an
American ambivalence about upholding the rules-based global system.
Populists are besieging governing elites in the West while [[Russia
works]{.mark} strategically [to **destabilize**]{.mark} **European and
American [governments]{.mark}**]{.underline} through propaganda and
proxies. A rising [China wants to create a global system that is not
U.S.-centric, one in which]{.underline} smaller powers defer to bigger
ones and norms of [democracy and rule of law do not
prevail]{.underline}. Meanwhile, **[[the U.S. alliance system looks
adrift]{.underline}]{.mark}** while competitors in China and Russia
appear to be on the march.

If it holds, [this trend could produce a **[spheres-of-influence
world]{.mark}** ]{.underline}--- which many, including the current
presidents of the United States, China, and Russia, find intuitively
attractive. But were such an order to replace one based on global
integration and American leadership in the geopolitical cockpits of
Europe and Asia, [it [would]{.mark} only [engender]{.mark} insecurity
and [conflict.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In a spheres-of-influence world, great powers order their regions. [The
United States would go back to a "Monroe Doctrine" version of grand
strategy; **[Russia would dominate]{.mark} the former [Soviet space;
China would govern East Asia, and India South
Asia]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The problem with this kind of order,
however, is several-fold.

Too many spheres overlap in ways that would generate conflict rather
than clean lines of responsibility. [[Japan
would]{.underline}]{.mark} oppose Chinese suzerainty in East Asia,
including by [[develop]{.mark}ing [nuclear weapons]{.mark}; [India and
China would compete]{.mark} vigorously]{.underline} in Southeast
Asia; [[Russia and China would contest]{.underline}]{.mark} the
resources and loyalties of [[Central Asia]{.mark}; [Europe and Russia
would clash]{.mark} over]{.underline} primacy of Central and [Eastern
Europe. [The Middle East would be a]{.mark}n ]{.underline}even more
likely arena for [[hot war between Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [and Iran, and
Turkey would contest regions also claimed by Russia, Europe,
and]{.mark}]{.underline} possibly [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[A [spheres of influence]{.mark} world [would]{.mark}]{.underline} also
**[[sharpen great power competition]{.mark}]{.underline}** outside of
each region**[. [Regional hegemony is a springboard for global
contestation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[China would]{.mark} be more
likely to [challenge the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates out-of-area if
it had subdued strategic competition in its own
region. [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, like the Soviet Empire before
it, [[would keep pushing west]{.mark} [until it met]{.mark} enough [hard
power]{.mark} to stop it]{.underline}. (The fact that Russian troops
marched through Paris during the Napoleonic Wars demonstrates that the
limits of Russian power need not be confined to the former Warsaw Pact).

American leaders have long understood that a "Fortress America" approach
is a source of national insecurity. Franklin Roosevelt made this case in
a series of "fireside chats" in the run-up to America's participation in
World War II --- even before the advent of the far more sophisticated
power-projection technologies that exist today. Roosevelt and his
generals well understood that the United States could not be safe if
hostile powers controlled Europe and Asia, despite the wide oceans
separating North America from both theaters.

A spheres-of-influence world would also crack up the integrated global
economy that underlies the miracle in human welfare that has lifted
billions out of poverty in past decades. It would replicate the
exclusive economic blocs of the 1930s, including an East Asia
"co-prosperity sphere," seeding conflict and undercutting prosperity.

A real-world and real-time example of what happens when American power
retreats in an effort to encourage regional powers to solve their own
problems is the mess in Syria. It has produced the greatest refugee
crisis since 1945 --- a stain on the consciousness of human
civilization --- and has led many to conclude that the Middle Eastern
order of states dating to the end of World War 1 is collapsing.

President Obama pursued an express policy of retracting American
military power from the Middle East, including withdrawing all troops
from Iraq and refusing to intervene militarily when President Assad used
chemical weapons against his own people, despite a red-line injunction
from the United States not to do so. Obama and his White House political
advisors believed that American withdrawal from the Arab Middle East (if
not from the ironclad U.S. commitment to Israel) would lead a new
balance of power to form, one policed by regional powers rather than by
America.

This flawed, amoral, and un-strategic approach has led to a series of
hot wars --- in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen --- the collapse of Arab allies'
confidence in the United States as an ally, as well as an intensified
cold war with Iran. Despite the international agreement freezing Iran's
nuclear program, Iran's support for terrorism and hostile insurgencies
targeting American allies across its region actually intensified during
this period.

This experience underlines a core problem with [[a spheres-of-influence
world]{.underline}]{.mark}. It [[leaves weaker states to become the
victims of stronger or more aggressive ones]{.underline}]{.mark}, and it
seeds insecurity by removing the reassuring variable of American
military guarantees and presence. [**It emboldens American adversaries**
and leads American allies to take self-help measures that themselves may
undercut American security interests]{.underline}.

A spheres-of-influence world would also produce contestation of the open
global commons that are the basis for the unprecedented prosperity
produced by the liberal international economic order. Should the Indian
and Pacific Oceans, or the Arctic and Mediterranean Seas, become arenas
of great-power conflict (like the South China Sea already has thanks to
China's militarization and unilateral assertion of sovereignty over it)
as leading states seek to incorporate them into their privileged zones
of control, economic globalization would collapse, harming the economies
of every major power.

The United States, because of its sheer power and resource base as well
as its relative geographical isolation, might do OK in a
spheres-of-influence world. Most of America's friends and allies would
not. Their weakening and insecurity would in turn render the United
States weaker and more insecure --- since U.S. allies are
force-multipliers for American hard and soft power, and since norms like
freedom of the global commons are in fact underwritten by that power.

More broadly, [such [a transition would]{.mark} also likely [lead
to]{.mark} the kind of [hot wars]{.mark}]{.underline} that reorder the
international balance of power, including **[by [incentivizing
aggressive states to]{.mark} push out and [assert regional
dominion]{.mark},]{.underline}** [knowing that America does not have the
will or interest to oppose them.]{.underline}

The fact that U.S. competitors such as Russia, China, and Iran --- all
of whom want to weaken the American-led world order --- would welcome a
spheres-of-influence world is another reason for Americans to oppose it.
It would also be ironic if the United States were to back away from its
historic commitment to shaping a world that is an idealized vision of
America itself --- one ruled by laws, norms, institutions, markets, and
peaceful settlement of disputes.

 

#### Global rule of law solves a myriad of existential threats. 

**Brooks, 14** -- Professor of Law at Georgetown and a senior fellow
with the New America/Arizona State University Future of War Project
(Rosa, "Embrace the Chaos", Foreign Policy,
11/14, <https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/11/14/embrace-the-chaos/>

In numerous ways, [[life has gotten substantially better in this]{.mark}
more crowded and [interconnected era]{.mark}]{.underline}. Seventy years
ago, global war killed scores of millions, **[but [interstate conflict
has declined sharply]{.mark} ]{.underline}**since the end of World War
II, and [the creation of [the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations [ushered]{.mark} in a far more
egalitarian and [democratic]{.mark} form of [international
governance]{.mark} ]{.underline}than existed in any previous era.
Today, [[militarily powerful states are]{.mark} far [less free]{.mark}
than in the pre-U.N. era [to use overt force]{.mark}]{.underline} to
accomplish their aims, [and [the
world]{.mark} now [has]{.mark}]{.underline} numerous transnational
courts
and [[dispute-resolution ]{.mark}bodies]{.underline} [[that]{.underline}]{.mark} collectively [[offer
states a]{.mark} viable [alternative to]{.mark} the use of
[force]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The modern international]{.underline}]{.mark}
order is no global utopia, but
it sure [[beats]{.underline}]{.mark} colonial domination and [[world
wars.]{.underline}]{.mark}

In the 50 years that followed World War II, [[medical and
ag]{.underline}]{.mark}ricultural [[advances brought unprecedented
health]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and prosperity]{.underline}]{.mark} to
most parts of the globe. More recently, the
[[communications]{.underline}]{.mark} revolution has
[[enabled]{.underline}]{.mark} exciting new forms of nongovernmental
cross-border alliances to emerge, empowering, for instance, [[global
human rights and environmental movements]{.underline}]{.mark}. In just
the last two decades, the near-universal penetration of mobile phones
has had a powerful leveling effect: All over the globe, people at every
age and income level can use these tiny but powerful computers to learn
foreign languages, solve complex mathematical problems, create and share
videos, watch the news, move money around, or communicate with far-flung
friends.

All this has had a dark side, of course. As access to knowledge has been
democratized, so too has access to the tools of violence and
destruction, and greater [[global interconnectedness enables disease,
pollution, and conflict to spread quickly and easily beyond
borders.]{.underline}]{.mark} A hundred years ago, no single individual
or nonstate actor could do more than cause localized mayhem; today, [[we
have to worry about]{.underline}]{.mark} massive [[bioengineered
threats]{.mark}]{.underline} created by tiny terrorist cells
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} globally [[devastating
cyberattacks]{.underline}]{.mark} devised by malevolent teen hackers.

Even as many forms of power have grown more democratized and diffuse,
other forms of power have grown more concentrated. A very small number
of states control and consume a disproportionate share of the world's
resources, and a very small number of individuals control most of the
world's wealth. (According to a 2014 Oxfam report, the 85 richest
individuals on Earth are worth more than the globe's 3.5 billion poorest
people).

Indeed, [[from a species-survival perspective, the world has grown
vastly more dangerous]{.underline}]{.mark} over the last century.
Individual humans live longer than ever before, but a small number
of [[states now possess the]{.underline}]{.mark} unprecedented [[ability
to destroy]{.underline}]{.mark} large chunks of the human race and
possibly [[the Earth itself]{.underline}]{.mark} --- all [[in a matter
of]{.underline}]{.mark} days or even [hours]{.mark}. What's more, though
the near-term threat of interstate nuclear conflict has greatly
diminished since the end of the Cold War, nuclear material and know-how
are now both less controlled and less controllable.

Amid all these changes, our world has also grown far more uncertain. We
possess more information than ever before and vastly greater processing
power, but the accelerating pace of global change has far exceeded our
collective ability to understand it, much less manage it. This makes it
increasingly difficult to make predictions or calculate risks. As I've
written previously:

We literally have no points of comparison for understanding the scale
and scope of the risks faced by humanity today. Compared to the long,
slow sweep of human history, the events of the last century have taken
place in the blink of an eye. This should ... give us pause when we're
tempted to conclude that today's trends are likely to continue. Rising
life expectancy? That's great, but if climate change has consequences as
nasty as some predict, a century of rising life expectancy could turn
out to be a mere blip on the charts. A steep decline in interstate
conflicts? Fantastic, but less than 70 years of human history isn't much
to go on....

That's why one can't dismiss the risk of catastrophic events \[such as
disastrous climate change or nuclear conflict\] as "high consequence,
low probability." How do we compute the probability of
catastrophic events of a type that has never happened? Does 70 years
without nuclear annihilation tell us that there's a low probability of
nuclear catastrophe --- or just tell us that we haven't had a nuclear
catastrophe yet?...

Lack of catastrophic change might signify a system in stable
equilibrium, but sometimes --- as with earthquakes --- pressure may be
building up over time, undetected....

Most analysts assumed the Soviet Union was stable --- until it
collapsed. Analysts predicted that Egypt's Hosni Mubarak would retain
his firm grip on power --- until he was ousted. How much of what we
currently file under "Stable" should be recategorized under "Hasn't
Collapsed Yet"?

This, then, is the character of world messiness in this first quarter of
the 21st century. So on to the next question: Where, in all this
messiness, does the United States find itself?

II\. The United States in the Mess: Goodbye, Lake Wobegon?

For Americans, the good news is that the United States remains an
extraordinarily powerful nation. The United States has "the most
powerful military in history," Obama declared in a recent speech.
Measured by sheer destructive capacity, he is surely right. The United
States spends more on its military than China, Russia, Saudi Arabia,
France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, and India combined. The U.S.
military can get to more places, faster, with more lethal and effective
weapons, than any military on Earth.

The United States also manages to gobble up a disproportionate share of
the world's wealth and resources. By the year 2000, wrote Betsy Taylor
and Dave Tilford, the United States, with "less than 5 percent of the
world's population," was using "one-third of the world's paper, a
quarter of the world's oil, 23 percent of the coal, 27 percent of the
aluminum, and 19 percent of the copper." In 2010, Americans possessed 39
percent of the planet's wealth.

The bad news for Americans? U.S. power and global influence have been
declining. In part, this is because various once-weak states have been
growing stronger, and in part, it's because no state can be as
autonomous today as it might have been in the past. The United States'
geographical position long helped protect it from external interference,
while its strong military and economy enabled it to dominate or control
numerous less powerful states. But globalization has reduced every
state's autonomy, creating collective challenges --- from climate change
to the regulation of capital --- that no state can fully address on its
own.

U.S. power and global influence have also declined in absolute terms, as
America's own political and economic health has been called into
question. The United States now has greater income inequality than
almost every other state in the developed world --- and most states in
the developing world. American life expectancy ranks well below that of
other industrialized democracies, and the same is true for infant
mortality and elementary school enrollment. Meanwhile, the United States
has the world's highest per capita incarceration rate, and on
international health and quality-of-life metrics, the United States has
been losing ground for several decades. This domestic decline
jeopardizes the country's continued ability to innovate and prosper; it
also makes American values and the American political and economic
systems less appealing to others.

Worse, the political system that Americans rely on for reform and repair
seems itself to be broken; the federal government shutdown in 2013
offered the world a striking illustration of U.S. political dysfunction.
Add to this the divisive national security policies of George W. Bush's
administration --- many of which were continued or expanded by the Obama
administration --- and it's no surprise that the United States has
recently become less admired and less emulated around the globe,
reducing American "soft power."

No matter how you slice it, it comes to the same thing: Compared with 30
years ago, the United States today has a greatly reduced ability to
control its own destiny or the destiny of other states. The United
States still has unprecedented power to destroy (Saddam Hussein and
Osama bin Laden both discovered this, to their detriment). But the
country's capacity for destruction is not equaled by its capacity to
shape the behavior of other states or their populations, and the United
States has less and less ability to insulate itself from the world's
woes.

Unfortunately, American political leaders share a bipartisan inclination
to deny these realities. Mostly, they succumb to the Lake Wobegon
effect: "Declinism" and "declinist" have entered the American political
vocabulary, but only as purely pejorative terms.

This is both stupid and dangerous. How can we adapt our global strategy
to compensate for the ways in which U.S. power has been declining if we
refuse to admit that decline?

Continued U.S. decline is certainly not inevitable, and some argue that
the United States is in fact poised for an economic and political
resurgence. There is no way to know for sure --- but it's worth
recalling that, historically, every significant empire has eventually
declined. Are we prepared to bet that the United States will prove an
exception?

There is also no way to know for sure what form continued or eventual
U.S. decline will take. We don't know whether it will be fast or slow;
we don't know whether the American Empire is in for a hard landing or a
soft one. Will the United States crash, like the former Soviet Union? Or
will a slow decline in power leave the country an intact and influential
nation, like the United Kingdom? Will America's future be more like
Canada's present, or more like Brazil's?

III\. Behind the Veil of Ignorance: Uncertainty as Lodestone

We don't know what America's future will look like, and we can make
fewer and fewer geopolitical predictions with confidence. The world has
changed too much and too fast for us to accurately assess the
probabilities of many types of future events. Perhaps this is why it's
so tempting for Americans to stay in Lake Wobegon, with eyes closed and
fingers crossed. Uncertainty is frightening.

But paradoxically, this very uncertainty should be a lodestone, pointing
realists and idealists alike toward a sensible, forward-looking global
strategy. In fact, radical uncertainty can be a powerful tool for
strategic planning.

That may seem oxymoronic, but consider one of the 20th century's most
influential thought experiments: In his 1971 book, A Theory of Justice,
philosopher John Rawls famously sought to use a hypothetical situation
involving extreme uncertainty to derive optimal principles of justice.

Imagine, said Rawls, rational, free, and equal humans seeking to devise
a set of principles to undergird the structure of human society. Imagine
further that they must reason from behind what Rawls dubbed a "veil of
ignorance," which hides from them their own future status or attributes.
Behind the veil of ignorance, wrote Rawls, people still possess general
knowledge of economics, science, and so forth, and they can draw on this
knowledge to assist them in designing a future society. Their ignorance
is limited to their own future role in the society they are designing:
"no one knows his place in society, his class position or social status,
nor does any one know his fortune in the distribution of natural assets
and abilities, his intelligence, strength, and the like."

If we were collectively designing social structures and rules, but could
not know our own individual future positions in that social structure,
what structures and rules would we come up with? Applying a version of
decision theory, Rawls concluded that in the face of such radical
uncertainty, rational, free, and equal beings behind the veil of
ignorance would be drawn toward a "maximin" (or "minimax") rule of
decision, in which they would seek to minimize their losses in a
worst-case scenario. Since those behind the veil of ignorance don't know
whether they'll be among the haves or among the have-nots in the society
they are designing, they should seek to build a society in which they
each will be least badly off --- even the luck of the draw leads them to
start with the fewest advantages.

Rawls posited that such a rule of decision should lead those behind the
veil of ignorance to support two core principles: the first relating to
liberty ("each person \[should\] have an equal right to the most
extensive basic liberty compatible with a similar liberty for others"),
and the second relating to social and economic goods. (Social goods
should be distributed equally, unless an unequal distribution would
serve the common good and be "to the greatest benefit of the least
advantaged," while "offices and positions \[should remain\] open to all
under conditions of fair equality of opportunity.")

This is in some ways intuitive: On a national level, it is the reason
Americans across the political spectrum continue to express substantial
support for the maintenance of unemployment benefits, Social Security,
Medicare and Medicaid, and so on. Any one of us might someday face a job
loss or illness; nearly all of us will eventually face old age. We know
we might someday need those benefits ourselves. In the face of
uncertainty about the future, we all recognize the value of insurance,
savings, and at least some minimal social safety net.

In the international arena, the same is true.

This has obvious implications for global strategy. Empires, like
individuals, can sink into poverty, illness, or simple old age --- and
in an era of uncertainty, empires, like individuals, would do well to
hedge against the possibility of future misfortune.

Indeed, two decades after the publication of A Theory of Justice, Rawls
sought to apply a form of this thought experiment to derive the core
principles that he believed would characterize a just global order. His
arguments are complex, and I can't do justice to them here --- but
fortunately, unlike Rawls, I am not interested in coming up with
abstract principles of global justice. My less lofty agenda is limited
to arguing that a crude version of Rawls's thought experiment can help
us delineate the contours of a sensible U.S. global strategy --- a
"maximin" strategy that is well-suited to protecting the interests of
the United States and its people, both in today's messy world and in a
wide range of future messes.

Here's my thought experiment.

Imagine a crude version of Rawls's veil of ignorance, with only the
United States behind it. This veil of ignorance doesn't require us to
disavow what we know of history (America's or the world's), nor does it
require us to disavow what we know of recent trends, present global
realities, U.S. values, or our current conception of the good. It only
hides our future from us: Behind this veil of ignorance, we don't know
whether energy, food, water, and other vital resources will be scarcer
or more plentiful in the decades to come; we don't know whether global
power will be more or less centralized; we don't know whether new
technologies and new forms of social organization will make existing
technologies and institutions obsolete.

Most of all, we don't know whether, in the decades to come, the United
States will be rich or poor, weak or strong, respected or hated. For
that matter, we don't know whether the United States --- or even the
form of political organization we call the nation-state --- will exist
at all a century or two from now. In the face of such radical
uncertainty, what kind of grand strategy should a rational United States
adopt?

Of course, this shouldn't really be called a "thought experiment" at
all: The United States already operates behind a veil of ignorance, if
we could only bring ourselves to admit it. We know the past; we have a
reasonable understanding of recent trends; we know that the world is
messy and dangerous; we know that the potential for rapid and
potentially catastrophic change is real; and we know that our ability to
predict future changes and quantify various risks is profoundly limited.

This knowledge is profoundly unsettling. Thus, we try our best to know
and not know, at the same time: We speak glibly of complexity,
accelerating change, danger, and uncertainty, but then fall back into
the comfortable assumption that continued U.S. global dominance is a
given and that catastrophic change is unlikely to occur. As long as we
remain willfully ignorant of the veil of ignorance that hangs over us,
we can avoid asking hard questions and making harder choices.

But this is shortsighted and dangerous. Empires that refuse to accept
reality tend to rapidly decline. A clear-eyed acceptance of uncertainty
and risk is the surest route to a more secure future. Instead of
blinding us or paralyzing us, the uncertainty of our future should
motivate us to engage in more responsible strategic planning.

If the United States can manage to be as rational as Rawls's
hypothetical decision-makers, it should adopt a similar maximin rule of
decision: It should prefer international rules and institutions that
will maximize America's odds of thriving, even in a worst-case future
scenario. In fact, we should wish for international rules and
institutions that will be kindest to the individuals living in what is
now the United States and their descendants, even if the United States
should someday cease to exist entirely.

Could happen, folks. Look around you. Do you see the Roman Empire, or
the Aztec Empire, or the Ottoman Empire?

IV\. From Messiness to Strategy: A Preliminary Sketch

This has urgent implications for U.S. strategic planning. Precisely
because U.S. global power may very well continue to decline, the United
States should use the very considerable military, political, cultural,
and economic power it still has to foster the international order most
likely to benefit the country if it someday loses that power.

[[The]{.mark} ultimate [objective]{.mark} of U.S. grand strategy [should
be]{.mark} the creation of [an]{.mark} equitable and
peaceful [international
order with]{.mark} an [effective]{.mark} ]{.underline}system of [[global
governance --- one that is built upon]{.mark} respect for human
dignity, [human rights, and]{.mark} the [rule of
law]{.mark}, ]{.underline}with robust mechanisms for resolving thorny
collective problems.

We should seek this not because it's the "morally right" thing for the
United States to do, but because a maximin decision rule should lead us
to conclude that this will offer the United States and its population
the best chance of continuing to thrive, even in the event of a radical
future decline in U.S. wealth and power.

But, one might argue, the United States already tries to promote such a
global order --- right?

Sure it does --- but only inconsistently, and generally as something of
an afterthought. We pour money into our military and intelligence
communities, but starve our diplomats and development agencies. We
fixate on the threat du jour, often exaggerating it and allowing it to
distort our foreign policy in self-destructive ways (cf. Iraq War),
while viewing matters such as United Nations reform or reform of global
economic institutions or environmental protection rules as tedious and
of low priority. [[If we take seriously the many
potential dangers lurking]{.underline}]{.mark} in the unknowable future,
however, [[fostering a]{.underline}]{.mark} stronger, fairer, and [[more
effective system of international governance would
become]{.underline}]{.mark} a matter of urgent national self-interest
and [[our highest strategic priority]{.underline}]{.mark} --- something
that should be reflected both in our policies and in our budgetary
decisions.

An effective global governance system would need to be built upon the
recognition that states remain the primary mode of political and social
organization in the international sphere, but also upon the recognition
that new forms of social organization continue to evolve and may
ultimately displace at least some states. An effective and dynamic
international system will need to develop innovative ways to bring such
new actors and organizations within the ambit of international law and
institutions, both as responsible creators of law and institutions and
as responsible subjects.

#### Holding allies accountable for human rights conduct [by reducing arms sales]{.underline} strikes the right balance in dealing with friendly dictators \-\-- doesn't sever relationships but [is necessary to check the global slide toward illiberalism]{.underline} 

**Brands, Professor of Global Affairs at the Johns Hopkins, 18**
(10/15/18, Hal -- Henry Kissinger Distinguished Professor at Johns
Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies, "Saudi
Crisis Shows the U.S. Needs a New Way to Deal With Dictators; Washington
has to recognize the downsides of alliances with nations that quash
democracy and human rights,"

The disappearance of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi has precipitated [a
new crisis in U.S.-Saudi relations]{.underline}. Yet that crisis
[has]{.underline} also [revived a]{.underline} much older
[dilemma]{.underline} in American strategy: [How to deal with allies
that also happen to morally abhorrent, even murderous,
dictatorships.]{.underline}

The basic predicament has been around for over a century. As the U.S.
established its dominance in the Western Hemisphere in the late 19th and
early 20th centuries, it often cooperated with local strongmen who could
provide some semblance of stability. [Throughout the Cold War,
containing communism required working with partners that were far from
morally pure]{.underline} --- dictators who ruled key allies such as
South Korea, Turkey, Portugal and Greece at various points, as well as a
clutch of Latin American and Middle Eastern despots.

The rapid spread of democracy from the 1970s through the early 2000s
eased this dilemma, by aligning the frontiers of freedom more closely
with the frontiers of America's European and Asia-Pacific alliances. Yet
the problem has now returned, and not just in the Middle East, because
of two factors.

The first is **[the]{.underline}** so-called **[[democratic
recession]{.mark} that began around 2006]{.underline}**, and which
**[[has]{.mark} subsequently [weakened]{.mark} democracy in [dozens of
countries]{.mark} around the world]{.underline}**. Illiberal and
anti-democratic practices have taken hold in key NATO countries: Turkey,
Poland and Hungary. In the Asia-Pacific, one U.S. ally --- Thailand ---
has been under military rule since 2014, while another --- the
Philippines --- has reverted to a bloody form of illiberal democracy
under Rodrigo Duterte. **[In [the Middle East]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
George W. Bush's Freedom Agenda and the hopes of the Arab Spring have
faded; **[[authoritarianism and instability are]{.mark} again [the
status quo]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

The challenge of handling these friendly authoritarians is greater
because of the second trend: [**the [resurgence of]{.mark} geopolitical
[revisionism]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As **[[hostile authoritarian
powers]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- China, Russia and Iran --- challenge
existing regional orders across Eurasia, they **[[are putting U.S.
power]{.mark} and influence [under pressure]{.mark} and sharpening the
dilemmas America faces in handling its more autocratic
allies.]{.underline}** Poland, Hungary, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the
Philippines may be acting in deeply distasteful ways, but they occupy
critical geostrategic real estate in today's most important geopolitical
competitions.

There have traditionally been two schools of thought on coping with this
problem. One was expressed most forcefully by Jeane Kirkpatrick, whose
famous article "Dictatorships and Double Standards," was published in
1979 and vaulted her to the forefront of U.S. policy-making during the
Ronald Reagan years.

Kirkpatrick argued that insisting that authoritarian allies adhere to
U.S. standards of political freedom and individual rights was an
invitation to disaster. It would destabilize those regimes internally,
raising the likelihood of a takeover by more radical and hostile forces.
This, Kirkpatrick alleged, was just what had happened in Nicaragua and
Iran in 1979, where U.S. pressure to respect human rights had weakened
authoritarian allies against the revolutionaries who toppled them.
Preserving a stable strategic environment in which the U.S. and its
allied democracies could thrive, and aggressive dictatorships such as
the Soviet Union could be contained, meant partnering with some friendly
devils along the way.

The second school of thought, expressed most prominently by Reagan's
secretary of state, George Shultz, held that this choice between
interests and ideals was a false one. Supporting dictators was no
guarantee of stability, because those regimes provoked hatred and
discontent that could eventually erupt into revolution.

Even supposedly friendly dictators could prove dangerous and
unpredictable, as the Argentine junta showed when it invaded the
Falkland Islands in 1982 and triggered a war with the U.K. And surely
the U.S. --- the world's leading democracy --- would be more secure and
influential in a world populated more fully by other democracies. The
U.S. could not promote democracy and confront authoritarians everywhere,
Shultz acknowledged. But generally speaking, spreading human rights and
democracy, while also holding friendly authoritarian regimes to account,
was a geopolitical imperative as well as a moral one.

Shultz's view won out in the Reagan administration, which played a
critical supporting role in the triumph of democratic forces in
countries from the Philippines and South Korea to El Salvador and Chile.
Yet because democracy was spreading like wildfire in the 1980s, and
because the Soviet threat was starting to fade, the choices were in many
ways less difficult for U.S. policymakers than they are now. Today,
Washington can usefully embrace insights from both schools of thought.

[From the Kirkpatrick school comes the hard truth that the U.S. can't
afford a break with many of its authoritarian allies today.]{.underline}
If holding the line against Chinese expansionism in the Asia-Pacific
seems hard now, just wait until the already-weak U.S. alliance with the
Philippines falls apart. Putting relations with Turkey, Poland or
Hungary into the deep freeze might be morally satisfying; it would also
create more opportunities for Russian mischief on NATO's eastern flank.

In the Middle East, [the U.S.-Saudi partnership remains
important]{.underline} for counterterrorism cooperation and as a bulwark
against Iranian ambitions. [Isolating Saudi Arabia might push Riyadh to
deepen its relations with Moscow and Beijing.]{.underline} Iran, Russia
and China are seeking to expand their influence by weakening the
strength and cohesion of U.S. alliances: Washington should not do its
rivals' work for them.

**[Yet [neither should America]{.mark}]{.underline}** do what the Trump
administration often seems included to do: **[[Give its allies a green
light to violate human rights and]{.mark} flout the [rule of
law]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Doing so simply **gives incentive for
further misdeeds**]{.underline}. **[[It erodes U.S. moral
standing]{.mark} by [leaving Washington vulnerable to charges of
selective morality and outright hypocrisy.]{.mark}]{.underline}** And
**[as [illiberalism]{.mark} spreads, it [weakens]{.mark} the liberal
ideological [glue that helps bind]{.mark} the U.S. to its closest
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}**; **[it [creates ideological
affinities]{.mark} between Washington\'s friends and its
rivals]{.underline}** (just look at the warm relationship between
Vladimir Putin and Hungary's strongman, Viktor Orban); **[[it
raises]{.mark} the longer-term [dangers of serious domestic instability
and]{.mark} even [revolution]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [One can
hardly look at]{.underline} Turkey or [Saudi Arabia today and wonder
whether harsh, autocratic rule is not driving up the likelihood of
debilitating internal strife]{.underline}.

**[[The U.S. must]{.mark} therefore [exact a cost]{.mark}, measured but
real, on the illiberal actions of its allies. This could mean
[reducing]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- but not fully halting --- **[[arms
sales]{.underline}]{.mark}**, speaking out more strongly against
repressive behavior, and perhaps even excluding quasi-authoritarian
allies such as Hungary from NATO exercises. Also helpful would be quiet
but consistent advocacy of respect for basic human rights in bilateral
diplomatic discussions, and --- where feasible --- increased support for
embattled democratic actors through institutions such as the National
Endowment for Democracy.

These measures can be calibrated according to the specifics of the case
and the degree of leverage Washington possesses: America can probably
take a harder line with Poland, which has nowhere else to go, than it
can with the Philippines, which has already been repositioning itself
closer to Beijing.

**[Above all, [the U.S. must avoid conveying]{.mark} its
[approval]{.mark} of [or]{.mark} simple [indifference to illiberal
practices]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Unfortunately, President **[Trump has
repeatedly done just this]{.underline}**, by praising Duterte's vicious
drug war, by singling out a backsliding Poland for praise in major
international speeches, by uncritically backing Crown Prince Mohammed
bin Salman and his power grab in Saudi Arabia, and **[by cultivating an
air of presidential indifference to issues of human rights and
democracy]{.underline}**. In fairness, [the president's comments that
the U.S. would exact punishment on Saudi Arabia if it\'s proved that
Riyadh was responsible for Khashoggi's disappearance were a good sign in
this regard; **[his pre-emptive public refusal to]{.mark} even [consider
restricting U.S. arms sales]{.mark}**]{.underline}, however, **[was a
very bad one]{.underline}**.

[[Striking the right balance]{.mark} in dealing with friendly dictators
[will]{.mark} always [be difficult. But]{.mark} **[the U.S. risks
compromising]{.mark} its [ideals and]{.mark} its [interests]{.mark} if
it doesn't even try**.]{.underline}

#### **Suspending arms sales allows the U.S. to [rebalance these relationships]{.underline} \-\-- avoids [reckless blowback]{.underline} without compromising military access** 

**Miller and Binder 19** -- Miller is the deputy director for policy at
the Project on Middle East Democracy and served as the director for
Egypt and Israel military issues at the U.S. National Security Council
from 2014 to 2017; Binder is the advocacy officer at the Project on
Middle East Democracy. Previously he served as the program manager and
research associate at the Center for International Policy's Security
Assistance Monitor program, where he focused on U.S. security assistance
and arms sales policy (Andrew Miller and Seth Binder, 5-10-2019, \"The
Case for Arms Embargoes Against Uncooperative Partners,\" War on the
Rocks,

DOA: 6-29-2019, smarx ) //SS

The efficacy of [withholding military assistance, including]{.underline}
grant aid and [arms sales, to modify the behavior of recipient countries
is]{.underline} a [hotly debated]{.underline} topic [in]{.underline} the
U.S. [foreign policy]{.underline} community. Last month, War on the
Rocks published another contribution to this discussion. In "The Case
Against Arms Embargos, Even for Saudi Arabia," Raymond Rounds opposes
what he calls an "arms embargo" on Saudi Arabia, arguing that suspending
U.S. arms sales as leverage over policy disagreements will only backfire
by driving the kingdom to purchase arms from other countries. He
contends that suspending sales to Saudi Arabia will fail to alter
objectionable Saudi conduct, whether in Yemen or domestically, while
"\[damaging\] ties with Saudi Arabia." According to Rounds, this dynamic
is not unique to Saudi Arabia, but a general proposition that applies to
all U.S. arms recipients.

If he is correct, [arms embargoes]{.underline} --- a regular tool of
U.S. foreign policy --- are quixotic attempts to shape the behavior of
foreign governments and [put the United States at a strategic
disadvantage]{.underline} to global competitors. While this
[argument]{.underline} seems reasonable, if depressing, it [suffers from
two principal and serious flaws]{.underline}.

First, [the empirical record does not support Rounds' contention that
[arms embargoes]{.mark} do not deliver]{.underline}. While these
suspensions are not a silver bullet, **[there is [ample evidence]{.mark}
to [demonstrate]{.mark} that they [can be effective in changing the
policy of a target country]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For example, in 2005,
[the United States successfully used]{.underline} the [[suspension
of]{.mark}]{.underline} a joint [[weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} project
[[to persuade Israel]{.mark} to cancel a]{.underline} proposed [sale of
drone]{.underline} equipment [to China]{.underline}. In another example,
then-Secretary of State Rex [Tillerson secured commitments from Egypt to
resolve a]{.underline} longstanding [criminal case against]{.underline}
[41 foreign NGO workers]{.underline}, including Americans and Europeans,
[and]{.underline} to [suspend military cooperation with North
Korea]{.underline} [in exchange for releasing]{.underline} \$195 million
in [suspended military aid]{.underline}. More recently, [[the
legislative hold]{.mark}]{.underline} Sen. Robert Menendez [placed [on
an arms sale to Saudi]{.mark} Arabia]{.underline} and the United Arab
Emirates, when [combined with threat]{.underline}ened legislation [to
impose further restrictions]{.underline} on transfers to Saudi Arabia,
[[helped pressure the]{.mark} Saudi-led [coalition]{.mark} in Yemen [to
re-engage in negotiations]{.mark} with the Houthis]{.underline},
resulting in an imperfect but still important deal on the port of
Hodeidah.

[The]{.underline} author's [argument that arms embargoes do not work
cites]{.underline} the [2013 suspension of U.S. military aid to
Egypt]{.underline} following that country's military coup. This policy
clearly failed to reverse the military coup led by current President
Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, but [there are good reasons to question the
validity of the example]{.underline}. [Proponents of the suspension
argue with good reason that it was not given a fair chance to
work]{.underline}. [Shortly after the decision was
announced]{.underline}, [senior U.S. officials told the Egyptians the
aid would soon be restored, undercutting the coercive value of the
suspension]{.underline}. From the perspective of the Egyptian
government, [it would have been irrational to make serious concessions
in response to]{.underline} what they believed was [an idle
threat]{.underline}. Just as important, due to a plethora of exceptions
and carve-outs, [some U.S. military assistance to Egypt continued
throughout the suspension period]{.underline}, including maintenance and
sustainment, sparing the Egyptian military from the full force of the
hold.

Despite undercutting its own suspension, [the hold still produced some
good.]{.underline} U.S. [diplomats]{.underline} were able to [leverage
the policy to deter]{.underline} the [Egypt]{.underline}ian government
[from]{.underline} [enforcing an arbitrary]{.underline} September 2014
[deadline for NGOs to register under Egypt's draconian 2002 NGO
law]{.underline}. And, although Egypt released U.S. citizen Mohamed
Soltan from prison two months after aid was resumed, [Cairo
was]{.underline} partly [motivated by the concern that the Obama
administration could reverse]{.underline} its decision to resume [arms
shipments]{.underline}. To be sure, these accomplishments were
relatively limited, and we should be careful not to overestimate the
efficacy of arms holds. A foreign government is unlikely to
fundamentally change its position on what it views as an existential
issue. But **[[prior suspensions have yielded tangible gains,
and]{.mark} they [should remain part of the U.S. foreign policy
toolkit.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Second, [Rounds also overstates the costs of suspending arms
transfers]{.underline}. He is particularly focused on the potential for
losing "[access]{.underline}," a term that [encompasses relationships
with the]{.underline} recipient [country's military
leadership]{.underline}; [insight into their views]{.underline},
organization, and doctrine; [and permission for the U.S. military to use
that country's bases and airspace]{.underline}. These are legitimate
concerns, but **[[suspensions do not]{.mark} automatically [compromise
access]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Egypt]{.underline}]{.mark}, for
instance, [[never curtailed the U.S. military]{.mark} ability to use the
Suez Canal or Egyptian airspace while arms transfers were on
hold]{.underline}. And, [while intelligence about a foreign military is
valuable]{.underline}, [we often have other, clandestine ways to acquire
such information]{.underline}. Moreover, **[[we should not conflate
access with influence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [U.S. military officials
had access to their Egyptian counterparts]{.underline} during the events
of 2013, [but those channels were of no use]{.underline} in deterring
Egypt's military from removing the country's democratically elected
president. Nor has U.S access reduced civilian casualties from
Saudi-coalition bombing in Yemen. In these cases, **[access without
influence does not absolve the United States of
complicity]{.underline}**.

The author's other major concern is that arms suspensions could result
in the loss of arms sales to strategic competitors like Russia or China.
The jobs created by such sales are not trivial matters, but studies have
found that they do not provide the economic benefits or jobs that are
often touted. Nor are these sales necessary to maintain the military
industrial base, which is powered by billions of dollars each year from
domestic purchases, except in rare cases. Fundamentally, the author's
implicit argument --- that if the United States reliably supplies
weapons to strategically important countries, they won't seek them
elsewhere --- is suspect. Countries, including close partners like Egypt
and the United Arab Emirates, have long sought to diversify their
weapons stockpiles, and in an increasingly multipolar world, more
countries are seeking to diversify their arms suppliers to maintain
their own independence. While U.S. arms will continue to compete with
Russian or Chinese counterparts on a sale-by-sale basis, it will become
increasingly unrealistic to be the exclusive supplier of any partner
country, irrespective of how reliable the United States is.

**[The reluctance to use the leverage afforded by arms transfers is
symptomatic of a broader pathology in U.S. foreign
policy]{.underline}**: **[a fixation on maintaining relationships
without regard to the value they provide]{.underline}**.
[**[Relationships are important, but the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**n]{.mark}ited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[should receive a commensurate return on its investments.]{.mark}
[When]{.mark} this is [not]{.mark} the case, [the]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited [**[S]{.underline}**t]{.mark}ates
**[[should]{.mark} not hesitate to [adjust the status and intimacy of a
bilateral relationship]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} including
**[[through]{.mark} the [suspension of arms
transfers]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Contrary to Rounds' argument, [such
steps can yield important policy gains]{.underline}. Even if they do
not, **[[we can]{.mark} at least [avoid]{.mark} some of the [blowback of
enabling reckless]{.mark} and rights-abusing
[actions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Distance does not have the allure of
access, but it may ultimately put the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[in a stronger strategic
position]{.underline}**

#### A [clear signal from Congress]{.underline} will rein in Trump's [commercially centered policy]{.underline} and [end U.S. complicity]{.underline} in war crimes

**Austin-Hillery & Margon, 19** \-\-- US program director and the
Washington director at Human Rights Watch (1/7/19, Nicole Austin-Hillery
and Sarah Margon, "Congress should put human rights first at home and
abroad. Prove some Americans care,"
<https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/01/07/new-congress-reverse-donald-trump-disrespect-human-rights-column/2424243002/>,
accessed on 5/10/19, JMP)

**[[The new Congress can show allies and adversaries]{.mark} that while
Trump may embrace cruel foreign leaders and policies, [US voters still
respect human rights.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[The new 116th Congress]{.underline}, with its diverse pool of new
members ushered in by a record number of voters, [has an opportunity to
demonstrate that human rights remain a priority]{.underline} for the
American people.

[For years, the U.S. has promoted respect for these rights]{.underline},
even if it has not always abided by the laws and treaties that protect
them. [This has advanced the long-term strategic interests of the U.S.,
as well as peace and security in the rest of the world.]{.underline}
After all, these rights --- to be free from discrimination, to have due
process, to have an adequate standard of living and to participate in
free and fair elections --- benefit not just Americans but everyone,
everywhere.

President Donald Trump, with his "America First" agenda, has all but
scrapped this approach. [To varying degrees, all U.S. presidents have
downplayed or overlooked [human rights]{.mark} concerns when other
interests were in play. But [Trump has gutted support]{.mark} for them
by]{.underline} embracing abusive foreign leaders who are jailing,
torturing and killing dissidents, by [[selling weapons to militaries
committing massive war crimes]{.underline}]{.mark}, and by undermining
international institutions and courts that seek justice for some of the
world's worst atrocities. At home, Trump has turned his back on
refugees, detained immigrant children, and rolled back regulations that
protect women's health, LGBT rights, and the water we drink.

Members of this new Congress have an opportunity to reverse course,
reiterate the importance of respect for human rights, and make clear
that the current path is not acceptable.

They can do this by protecting gains made under the Affordable Care Act,
which has expanded access to health care for millions of Americans, and
ensuring that coverage includes the full range of sexual and
reproductive health care services. They can pass even stronger criminal
justice reform that eliminates mandatory minimum sentencing and the
racial disparities that permeate the criminal justice, education and
health systems.

They should also protect Dreamers, and hold oversight hearings into
family separation and dangerous detention conditions. To help protect
and restore the right to vote in the federal elections, they should pass
the Democracy Restoration Act, and hold oversight hearings on voter
suppression tactics.

Bipartisan legislation has been proposed to reverse the transgender
military ban --- a discriminatory policy that met with immediate
opposition from military leadership, lawmakers in both parties, the
public, and federal courts. They should pass this legislation, as well
as the Equality Act, which would curb the administration's wider efforts
to roll back federal protections of transgender rights.

Use power of the purse to shape foreign policy

**[On foreign policy, although the executive branch has predominant
power, [Congress can be a vital check while]{.mark} also vigorously
[promoting a foreign policy that]{.mark} not only defends but also
[safeguards basic rights]{.mark}. Congress can let both allies and
adversaries know that even if the White House isn't invested in human
rights promotion overseas, the rest of America is.]{.underline}**

Congress can also aggressively influence U.S. foreign policy by using
the power of the purse to ensure that U.S. programs and policies
overseas align more explicitly with the promotion of basic rights. And
building on bipartisan support in the current Senate, Congress should
permanently repeal the "Global Gag rule," which restricts the use of
U.S. funds for programs critical for women's health care abroad.

It should also take up legislation in other areas on which the
administration has failed to engage constructively, including forced
political re-education camps in China's Xinjiang region and the need to
make human rights a key element of US relations with Saudi Arabia.
**[[Systematically blocking weapons sales]{.mark} to repressive leaders
[would rein in]{.mark}]{.underline}** President **[[Trump's commercially
centered approach to arms transfers while]{.mark} also [sending a clear
message: the US will not be complicit]{.mark} in other countries' war
crimes]{.underline}**.

Congress needs to course-correct on rights

Regular oversight hearings should explore the administration's
uncritical support of autocratic and abusive governments, including in
Hungary, Poland and Thailand. Congress should look at the State
Department's move to strike reproductive rights from its annual global
human rights report, and the troubling likelihood that Sudan will be
removed from the state sponsors of terrorism list. Finally, regular
meetings with and statements to support independent activists,
journalists and lawyers as well as overseas travel are all ways Congress
can revive a more inclusive and rights-respecting foreign policy.

[As lawmakers lay out their agenda and attempt to repair the damage done
over the last two years, a crucial part of their leadership requires
asserting basic rights as a core policy component --- whether domestic
or foreign.]{.underline} That\'s not just the right thing to do, it is
in America's best interests.

#### Congressional action is necessary to [convince other countries]{.underline} that there is [still strong U.S. support]{.underline} to challenge authoritarianism \-\-- unilateral Trump action will just be read as [hypocrisy]{.underline} and [cynicism]{.underline}

Amid the endless post-mortem of Donald Trump's first overseas trip,
[human rights advocates have focused more fire on what the president
didn't say than what he did: His failure to call out rights abuses in
Saudi Arabia or anywhere else left activists aghast.]{.underline} Yet,
nearly five months into Trump's administration, his attitude toward
human rights can come as no surprise. [The president doesn't go much for
strictures of any kind, much less international legal standards and
softer norms developed by humanitarians, activists, and
lawyers.]{.underline} He has little regard for precepts and edicts
enshrined in treaties and overseen by U.N. institutions. He isn't moved
by the invocation of universal values, principles, or truths. He isn't
even moved by the courage of the powerless citizen who challenges the
strongman; **[between [authoritarian rulers and]{.mark} the
[dissidents]{.mark} who challenge them, [he chooses the former]{.mark}
almost [every time]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

In light of this, [it is time for human rights advocates to pivot from
voicing outrage at the president's failure to press for rights in his
global pronouncements and appearances and instead double down on making
sure the rest of the world understands he does not speak for all
Americans]{.underline}. The idea that the current White House will press
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to release his country's jailed
journalists and academics, urge China's Xi Jinping to loosen
restrictions on anti-government speech, or persuade Arab leaders to
usher in democratic reforms is fantasy. Moreover, **[coming from [this
president]{.mark}, speeches and [statements on human rights would ring
hollow]{.mark}, [compounding the global propensity to read]{.mark}
hypocrisy and [cynicism into American articulations of
values]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Rights advocates would be better
off]{.underline}]{.mark}** working to temper the worst in Trump's
domestic policies and **[[finding other vehicles and voices to uphold,
and]{.mark} ultimately [restore]{.mark}, the [credibility]{.mark} of
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[as a global human rights standard-bearer]{.underline}**. Advocates
may find **[there is a silver lining]{.underline}** of sorts **[in
[Trump's silence]{.mark} on rights: It [creates an opportunity for more
credible actors]{.mark} --- from]{.underline}** members of
**[[Congress]{.mark} to intellectuals and activists --- [to remind the
world]{.mark} that [despite Trump]{.mark}]{.underline}**[']{.mark}s
election, **[[liberal values]{.mark} and support for dissidents [remain
strong]{.mark} across the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates.

Consider Trump's speech in Saudi Arabia, which aimed to rally Sunni
Muslim nations to redouble the fight against terrorism. [Trump promised
Arab allies, "We are not here to lecture --- we are not here to tell
other people how to live, what to do, who to be, or how to worship."
Trump's sojourn in Saudi Arabia made no mention of the country's
imprisoned and brutalized political dissidents, no comment on its
repressive policies toward women, gays and lesbians, or minority
groups.]{.underline} Foregoing critique of any kind, he pronounced the
kingdom "magnificent." And just weeks before, Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson gave a tour d'horizon speech to diplomats that stressed
national security and economic interests and slighted human rights and
democratic values.

Make no mistake: [Trump]{.underline} and Tillerson['s]{.underline}
[silence on human rights issues is a betrayal to rights advocates and
those they defend]{.underline}. [[There is every reason to voice
alarm]{.mark} that [the U.S. president is]{.mark} surrendering American
credibility as a force for human rights, betraying rights defenders and
dissidents who have long looked to Washington as an ally, and even
undercutting years of rights-oriented policy by]{.underline}
**[[demonstrating that America's commitment to its]{.mark} professed
[values is]{.mark} politically [contingent and
expendable]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The damage caused by Trump's
reversals will be real and lasting. However fraught and uneven, the U.S.
commitment to human rights has long imbued its foreign policy with a
sense of moral conviction and uplift, tempered some of Washington's most
bellicose and self-serving instincts, and made international affairs
into something more purposeful than a grinding, cyclical power game.

[But the real blow to U.S. global human rights leadership
is]{.underline}, of course, [a function of beliefs, policies, and
actions --- not simply the rhetoric that reflects them]{.underline}.
Trump was quick to remake the Obama administration's standoffish
relationship with Egyptian military ruler Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, ending
the cold shoulder with the warm embrace of a high-profile visit to
Washington and praise for the autocrat's "fantastic job" as president.
Neither Trump nor anyone in the administration has spoken about Egypt's
killing of protesters and arrests of tens of thousands of political
dissidents. Trump's affection has given Sisi license to issue a
draconian new law regulating nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), never
mind that such laws have previously been used to target and even jail
American NGO workers. In late March, [[Tillerson greenlighted]{.mark}
large-scale [arms shipments]{.mark} including F-16 airplanes [to
Bahrain, lifting human rights conditions]{.mark} that the Obama
administration imposed after a harsh crackdown on
protesters]{.underline}. [The most heavily touted "deliverable" of
Trump's Middle East junket was a \$110 billion [arms sale to
Saudi]{.mark} Arabia. **[No amount of homage]{.mark} to jailed activists
or pleas for women's rights [could]{.mark} ever [have made up for
that.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Earlier, Tillerson had skipped the public release of the State
Department's annual global human rights report, an event traditionally
attended by his predecessors regardless of party. In his initial weeks
in office, Trump made clear that he favored reintroducing torture as an
interrogation technique and only demurred because Defense Secretary
James Mattis talked him out of it. **[[Top human rights posts]{.mark} in
the administration either sit [empty or have been filled with officials
who lack]{.mark} any human rights [background or expertise]{.mark} ---
meaning that when key decisions are made, no one will be at the table to
advocate that rights be considered.]{.underline}** Trump's one grand
"humanitarian" gesture since taking office, ordering cruise missile
strikes on a Syrian air base that was used to launch a chemical weapons
attack, was, by his own account, an act of intuition and impulse, driven
by outrage and possibly by compassion but not by fealty to an
international norm under assault.

The Trump administration has also pursued domestic policies that call
into question America's claim to international leadership in areas
including press freedom, tolerance for political dissent, women's
rights, and the protection of religious minorities, refugees, and
immigrants. Trump's attacks on the press and false cries of fake news
make it impossible for him to act as a champion for the rights of
journalists or independent media globally. His indignation at criticism
and propensity to lash out against opponents make him an uneasy ally for
dissidents worldwide. His slashing of funding for women's health care
and reproductive rights would hollow out any pronouncements he might
offer on women's rights. His restrictive approach to refugees, plans for
a wall to block migrants from Mexico, and indifference toward immigrant
workers render him unfit to extoll the virtues of a humane approach to
global migration. Beyond that, Trump's refusal to respect the integrity
and independence of federal law enforcement institutions, his cronyism,
nepotism, lack of transparency, and proclivity toward self-dealing make
him an impossible exponent for the values of good governance,
accountability, transparency, and rule of law that underpin the defense
of human rights.

Given all this, human rights advocates need to do more than decry each
and every missed opportunity for the president to articulate a set of
values that he manifestly does not share. [Even those U.S. presidents
most passionate about the spread of rights and freedoms]{.underline} ---
Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and Barack Obama --- [walked a tightrope in
trying to maintain America's credibility on human rights while seeking
to advance a breadth of foreign-policy interests, many of which directly
contradicted rights-respecting policies]{.underline}. [For as long as
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has
had an articulated human rights policy Washington has been dogged by
charges of selectivity, hypocrisy, and empty rhetoric]{.underline}.
[Against this backdrop]{.underline}, **[[Trumpian pronouncements]{.mark}
on human rights seem liable to [hurt more]{.mark} than they help,
[making it easier to impugn other American leaders and future
presidents]{.mark} as equally insincere]{.underline}**.

[This is not to suggest that advocates should give up on the role of
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [as a
defender of human rights]{.underline}. [Now, with authoritarianism on
the rise in China, Russia, Turkey, the Philippines, and Hungary and
intact in much of the Middle East and Africa --- and **backsliding
likely to accelerate amid an absence of leadership from the White
House** --- brave rights defenders and dissidents in those countries
need more international support]{.underline}, not less. **[Left to their
own interests, governments like Russia and China that wish to weaken
international human rights institutions and instruments will seize
opportunities to expand their influence.]{.underline}** [Progress made
in advancing norms of international accountability, LGBT rights, and the
protection of journalists and human rights defenders will almost
certainly atrophy.]{.underline}

But **[crocodile tears from]{.underline}** President **[Trump, should
they even be offered, will address none of that]{.underline}**. **[[Much
more important are efforts to show the world]{.mark} that [the current
administration is neither the]{.mark} only [face of America's role in
the world nor the sole vessel for U.S. values]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Most foreign governments and informed citizens know that most of
Washington regards his leadership with skepticism and that his public
approval ratings are at historic lows. **[Members of
[Congress]{.mark}]{.underline}**, civil society organizations, and other
institutions **[work to defend human rights globally and can speak out
and step up where the current administration won't]{.underline}**.
**[The [role of]{.mark} these actors]{.underline}** in showing
solidarity with dissidents, **[[calling out repressive
policies]{.underline}]{.mark}**, supporting rights defenders, **[[and
advocating for]{.mark} the role of [institutions and norms should
redouble]{.mark} as the White House retreats]{.underline}**. [That Trump
won't --- and can't credibly --- speak out doesn't mean that American
society or even the American government must go quiet]{.underline}.
**[Members of [Congress can]{.mark}]{.underline}** hold hearings, send
letters, take meetings with visiting advocates, take part in
delegations, and **[otherwise [demonstrate]{.mark} that [the U.S.
government]{.mark} as a whole [takes seriously its role as a human
rights standard-bearer,]{.mark} even if the current administration
amounts to an egregious lapse]{.underline}**.

Funders should step up to help alleviate the strain that civil society
organizations face in trying to address the challenges posed by the
president's domestic policies while simultaneously trying to fill the
vacuum created by the administration's retreat from America's
traditional role as a rights defender globally. These groups should not
be forced to choose now that the agenda at home has grown so imperative
as well.

In recent years, private funders of human rights campaigns have been
shifting their support away from U.S.- and European-based groups in
favor of direct help to advocates working in hotspots around the world.
The logic is simple: The solution to human rights abuses in Turkey,
Russia, or China won't be found in Washington. The Obama administration
reinforced these efforts through its own campaign to buttress local
civil society organizations around the world, offer them financial
support, and elevate their participation in international diplomacy.
Importantly, this assistance in funding and organizational development
came backed with the moral leadership of the U.S. government voiced at
the highest levels and through its diplomatic missions.

But with President Trump's budget dramatically scaling back such
support, foundations should reinvest additional resources in
organizations and partners who can keep faith with international
counterparts, raise the global media profile of rights violations and
crises, and apply pressure through international mechanisms and forums.
Such efforts will help blunt the impact of the Trump administration's
indifference, catalyze the engagement of Capitol Hill on human rights
issues, and sustain and strengthen connections internationally. Trump's
retreat from leadership on human rights can be mitigated if
nongovernmental groups lean in. Just as civil society organizations and
the media are tempering some of the president's most constitutionally
and morally dubious domestic policies, so they should also help to
bridge shortfalls in funding, speak out for those who counted on the
United States for support, and fortify civil society groups that the
Trump administration is abandoning.

**[[The best way to preserve America's]{.mark} global human rights
[leadership is not to put words in Trump's mouth but to
demonstrate]{.mark} that the [U.S. system of government]{.mark}, strong
independent civil society, and claim to global leadership [are strong
enough to withstand his]{.mark} term of [office.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### Israel Violates Human Rights

#### Leahy Law is necessary in order to combat abundant human rights violations by Israel

**SHIHADAH 18**-- advocate for Palestinian liberation (Kathryn, \"Leahy
Law would cut aid to Israel, but no one wants to enforce it,\" If
Americans Knew ssBlog,
<https://israelpalestinenews.org/leahy-law-would-cut-aid-to-israel-but-no-one-wants-to-enforce-it/>,
4-19-2018 )ML

[The Leahy Laws were designed to uphold human rights in countries that
receive United States aid.]{.underline} These laws enable the US to
withhold military assistance from units and individuals in foreign
security forces if they have committed a gross violation of human rights
(GVHR).

The laws -- one for the State Department and a similar one for the
Department of Defense -- are implemented through a vetting process based
on annual Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights, reports
from reliable NGOs, and other sources. According to principal sponsor
Senator Leahy (D-VT), the legislation "makes it clear that when credible
evidence of human rights violations exists, US aid must stop."

GVHRs (Gross Violations of Human Rights) that can trigger Leahy include

extrajudicial killing

torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment

prolonged detention without charges and trial

causing the disappearance of persons by the abduction and clandestine
detention of those persons

other flagrant denial of the right to life, liberty, or the security of
person

politically motivated rape

[Since its founding in 1948, Israel has received nearly \$125 billion in
aid from the US; the current rate amounts to over \$10 million a
day.]{.underline} Is anyone keeping an eye on the recipient of 50% of
our total foreign military aid? The answer is a resounding Yes.

Dozens of NGOs monitor and report on Israel's actions; our State
Department has generated a Country Report on Human Rights every year
since 1976. If Israel is regularly committing GVHRs, it is easily
verifiable.

\[See below for additional U.S. laws that Israel violates\]

The Great March of Freedom

The border between occupied Gaza and Israel is the site of a 6-week mass
protest which started on March 30th and is planned to last till May
15th, 2018. The event, called the Great March of Freedom, recalls
several important events in Palestinian history.

March 30th is Land Day, when Palestinians commemorate that moment in
1976 in which Israel institutionalized the theft of Palestinian land,
the day that Israeli forces killed 6 peaceful protesters.

May 15th is Independence Day in Israel, but for Palestinians it is Nakba
Day, commemorating the "catastrophe" in which Israel took over 78% of
their land in 1948 and sent 800,000 Palestinians into exile. Within
months, the United Nations passed a resolution guaranteeing them the
right of return to their land and homes.

Tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza -- 70% of whom are refugees
from 1948 or their descendants -- have been gathering nonviolently to
protest the occupation and blockade of their land, and to demand the
right of return.

[Israeli forces have responded to unarmed Palestinians with snipers and
live fire, killing at least 32 and injuring over 2,870 in the first 3
weeks of the Great March.]{.underline}

[Most of the world has condemned Israel's actions from the start, as it
did for many Israeli incursions into Palestinian territory which
resulted in massive casualties]{.underline}. In fact most of the world
has criticized Israel for consistently for years. Pro-Israel NGO UN
Watch has been tracking global censure of Israel in the United Nations
since 1993 with the stated goal of "monitor\[ing\] the performance of
the UN by the yardstick of its own Charter" and the unspoken objective
of proving that the UN has an anti-Israel bias. The organization
reports:

UN Human Rights Council: From its creation in June 2006 through June
2016, 68 out of 135 resolutions (over 50%) have been against Israel

UN Nations General Assembly: From 2012 through 2015, 83 out of 97
resolutions (86%) have been against Israel

UNESCO: Each year, this body adopts around 10 resolutions a year
criticizing only Israel (UNESCO does not criticize any other UN member
state in a country-specific resolution -- except Syria once in 2013)

Although Israel is a signatory of the Geneva Conventions, it has also
chosen to disregard parts of this international treaty as well.

[In spite of worldwide outcry, and with the Leahy Laws on the books for
years, American military aid to Israel has increased year after year.
American politicians apparently don't find Israel's actions worthy of
reprimand.]{.underline}

Human Rights

Israel regularly uses a broad definition of "terrorist" to excuse human
rights abuses against Palestinians. When soldiers shot a boy in the
face, they explained that he was climbing the wall around their compound
-- he might have been a terrorist. When they detained a 3-year-old child
who was running toward them with a zucchini scraper -- they pointed out
that he might be booby-trapped. When 2 million people are denied
medicine and food for 10 years, it is easily rationalized: they support
Hamas, which shoots rockets into Israel. In Defense Minister Avigdor
Lieberman's words, "There are no innocent people in the Gaza Strip."

And now: killing and injuring unarmed, nonviolent protesters is
justifiable because Israel's border is sacred and must not be
approached, let alone compromised. "The border fence between Israel and
the Gaza Strip separates a sovereign state and a terrorist
organization."

[Israel justifies the use of lethal force against peaceful protesters --
and decades of other illegal or questionable actions -- so effectively
that American politicians remain unwavering in their loyalty. American
taxpayers need to judge the virtue of the Israeli rationale on the basis
of hard facts. Set Israel's actions next to the Leahy list of gross
violations of human rights, and it becomes clear that it time for the
Leahy Laws to be enforced. It is past time.]{.underline}

Extrajudicial killing violates international law

International law restricts the lethal use of firearms to a last resort;
however, Israeli officials have repeatedly contravened this standard in
public statements.

After the first weekend of the Great March, army spokespeople indicated
that all of the Palestinians killed had been taking violent action or
tampering with the border fence, and at least 10 of the victims were
members of Hamas. They were all executed without trial.

On the second weekend of the March, Gazan journalist Yasser Murtaja, who
was lethally shot while wearing a clearly marked "PRESS" vest, was
rebuffed by Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman as a "Hamas terrorist."
No evidence was produced. The U.S. State Department had vetted him and
he was set to receive funds from USAID. Murtaja was executed without
trial.

These were not aberrant killings by rogue soldiers: Israeli leaders
regularly encourage extrajudicial killing and excessive force.

Transportation Minister Yisrael Katz stated in 2016, that "we cannot let
attackers remain alive, risking the lives of Jews."

In 2015, Jerusalem Police District Commander Moshe Edri stated that
"Everyone who stabs Jews or harms innocent people -- should be killed."

Also in 2015, Israeli Police Minister Gilad Erdan declared that "if a
terrorist has a knife or screwdriver in his hand, you should shoot to
kill him without thinking twice." He added, "every attacker who sets out
to inflict harm should know that he will likely not survive the attack."

And Avigdor Lieberman, who is now defense minister, advocated in a 2015
Facebook post for a policy in which "no attacker, male or female, should
make it out of any attack alive."

Defense for Children International-Palestine reports that 2015 saw
Israeli forces execute at least 28 Palestinian children alone, thanks in
part to the environment created by its leaders and a broad shoot-to-kill
policy.

Amnesty International has also been tracking Israel's extrajudicial
killings for years.

The Leahy Laws remain untouched.

Torture

Torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment is
another Leahy trigger. In international law, torture is forbidden; in
Israeli law, a small window called "extraordinary circumstances" has
enabled authorities to make abundant use of the practice.

Palestinians have registered least 1,000 complaints of torture since
2000, but this year -- 2018 -- is the first time one has led to a
criminal investigation. The rest were summarily dismissed.

Abdel Nasser Farwana, head of the Palestinian Detainees and Ex-Detainees
Committee Studies and Documentation Unit, reports that 71 Palestinian
prisoners have died from torture since 1967, and dozens of others have
died shortly after release. Farwana adds, "Israel...is the only country
in the world that legalizes torture in its jails and detention camps and
protects its perpetrators. Israel uses torture on institutional level
against Palestinian and Arab detainees."

[A report in Foreign Service Journal reported that Israeli torture has
also extended at times to American citizens.]{.underline}

The Leahy Law should have kicked in years ago, cutting off aid to
Israel's prison establishment.

Prolonged detention without charges and trial

Administrative detention is a process meant only for rare cases: for a
detainee who has not committed an offense, on the grounds that s/he
plans to break the law at some future time. The detainee is not charged
and does not stand trial. Like torture, administrative detention is
overused in Israel.

In a recent report, Addameer reveals that during the first 2 months of
2018, Israeli forces had already detained 1319 Palestinians, including
274 children, 23 women, and 4 journalists. Since 2000, Israel has
detained at least 12,000 children alone.

Addameer crunched the numbers and found that since 1967, more than
800,000 Palestinians have been detained. [This amounts to approximately
20% of the total Palestinian population in the occupied Palestinian
territories, and upwards of 40% of the total male Palestinian
population. Approximately 10,000 women have been detained since
2000.]{.underline}

While international law permits detention without trial under extremely
limited, emergency circumstances, critics argue that Israel has
exploited the measure, instituting it on a massive scale, and denying
detainees due process.

Ultimately, about 95% of detainees are released without charge or trial.

B'tselem summarizes the practice:

How many more years does Israel need to misappropriate administrative
detention before the Leahy Law is activated?

Abduction and clandestine detention

The Women's Centre for Legal Aid and Counselling (WCLAC), a Palestinian
NGO, estimates that the Israeli military conducts nearly 1,400 night
raids per year (in addition to daytime operations) -- over 65,000 since
1967.

These raids have been heavily criticized by human rights organizations
as especially damaging to children. Usually conducted around 2 am, they
start with loud banging on the door or an explosion to blast the door
open. Homes are ransacked, family members threatened, and children often
see a parent abducted -- or are abducted themselves during these raids.

On one night in August 2017, 15 Palestinians were detained in a single
raid in East Jerusalem; 160 were arrested in 12 days in July 2017, 30 of
them minors.

Politically motivated rape

Actual rape has been reported in Israeli prisons: in 2005, doctors
verified the violent abuse of a Lebanese prisoner by an Israeli
interrogator; counselors have witnessed confidential descriptions from
Palestinian women of rape by Israeli soldiers. Rasmea Odeh has publicly
discussed horrific torture and rape.

While the subject of rape is socially taboo in Palestine and statistics
are impossible to gather, it is important to note that the United
Nations Istanbul Protocol states that "verbal sexual threats, abuse and
mocking are also part of sexual torture." In the Palestinian culture,
threats of a sexual nature are a very serious matter, and are globally
they are considered to be a form of torture.

According to a 2017 report from Addameer, the practices of sexual
harassment, threats of rape (directed at themselves and family members),
sexually degrading insults, and strip and body searching of female
prisoners are "common and systematic."

Male prisoners have been somewhat more willing to speak up on the
subject. Israeli clinical psychologist Daniel J.N. Weishut published a
report in 2015 which reveals that "Israeli authorities are systemically
involved with torture and ill-treatment of a sexual nature."

He also notes that while dozens of cases have come up, no convictions
have been returned; in all but one case, the complaints were rejected by
the authorities.

In 2010, a study by Defense for Children International-Palestine led to
the conclusion that "sexual harassment and sexual abuse" have been used
across the board in the interrogation of child prisoners.

Other flagrant denial of the right to life, liberty, or the security of
person

Statistics on punitive demolitions of Palestinian homes are easy to
find; as are reports on the demolitions of entire villages, destruction
of crops, collective punishment, and unnecessary delays at checkpoints
even for medical emergencies. The list is long.

This is in addition to the ongoing theft of land and resources, the
ongoing blockade of Gaza and occupation of both Gaza and the West Bank,
and other human rights abuses.

Accountability

Implementing the Leahy Law, the U.S. government vets foreign security
forces to ensure that aid recipients have not committed gross human
rights abuses, and engages with governments to promote accountability
and measures to prevent future abuses.

The purpose of the Leahy Law is to hold states accountable for their
actions. Israel considers itself immune from accountability, all the
while collecting over \$10 million a day in military aid from the United
States. The Jewish State makes little attempt to hide its human rights
abuses.

Even before the Great March of Return began, Israeli rhetoric and
actions pointed to a massacre. Prime Minister Netanyahu employed at
least 100 snipers, with orders to shoot anyone trying to breach the
border fence. Senior IDF officers were quoted as saying that they were
perfectly willing to produce a high body count: it was a "price
\[Israel\] would be willing to pay to prevent a breach" of the border
fence.

After the first weekend of the Gaza Great March of Return, condemnation
came from (almost) all sides and calls for investigation from both the
UN secretary-general and the EU chief of foreign policy. Israel's
Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman would have none of it: "Israeli
soldiers did what was necessary. I think all our soldiers deserve a
medal." He added, "As for a commission of inquiry -- there won't be
one."

In fact, quite the opposite was true. Major General Yoav Mordechai,
Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, called on the
World Health Organization (WHO) to restrain Gazans who planned to burn
tires during the second weekend of protest. Mordechai insisted that it
was "irresponsible behavior" that would cause "unprecedented air
pollution.

This is part of an ongoing pattern of blatant refusal of accountability.

In 2016, after being denied entrance to the occupied Palestinian
territories for 18 months, UN rapporteur for human rights Makarim
Wibisono gave up and resigned his position. Israel's foreign ministry
spokesman explained the refusal: "Israeli human rights are violated too,
every day, by Palestinians, and until this ends the council will not be
taken seriously as a body that respects human rights."

[In 2016, 10 Congress people -- one of which was Senator Leahy -- sent a
letter to Secretary of State John Kerry, urging him to investigate
extrajudicial killings and other possible GVHRs in Israel, and
recommending application of the Leahy Law.]{.underline}

When Netanyahu got wind of the letter, his response was swift and
decisive:

The Prime Minister was apparently comfortable making this statement, in
spite of the fact that a week earlier, Israeli soldier Elor Azaria had
been caught on video shooting a Palestinian man in the head at zero
range, as the man lay wounded and unarmed on the ground. (Netanyahu
later called for pardon for Azaria, stating that there had already been
enough pain "first and foremost for Elor and his family, IDF soldiers,
and many citizens and parents of our soldiers, myself included.")

The viral video notwithstanding, Netanyahu also called Secretary Kerry
and insisted that he go on record declaring that Israel is not guilty of
extrajudicial assassinations.

All of this was in the context of Netanyahu's panhandling to increase
military aid from the United States to \$4.5 billion a year.

[In 2011, then Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak literally got away
with murder when the Leahy Law came under discussion. Barak explained to
Senator Leahy, "the difference between Israel and terror groups or other
countries in the Middle East is that we give an accounting and there is
monitoring."]{.underline}

He also reminded the senator that Palestinians who feel they have been
wronged are welcome to approach the High Court of Justice. According to
B'tselem, this judicial body routinely refuses to grant any semblance of
justice to Palestinians.

The vast majority of US politicians are enablers of Israel in its
crimes.

In 2015, Israel launched an attack on Gaza, "Operation Protective Edge,"
in which over 2,000 Palestinians died and 10,000 were injured (71
Israelis were killed and 1,300 were injured). Rather than censuring
Netanyahu for this ferocious attack, President Obama agreed to sell
Israel \$1.9 billion in arms -- this in addition to the extra munitions
Israel helped itself to when running low on mortar rounds and grenades
just 2 weeks into that incursion.

A Pentagon spokesman commented on Palestinian casualties: "The high
civilian death toll makes clear that Israel can and must do more to meet
its own high standards for protecting civilians from being killed."

The spokesman was quick to state America's eternal support for "Israel's
right to defend itself."

While turning a blind eye to its own human rights abuses, Israel takes
up the gauntlet against Palestinians when it comes to any resistance,
even when it is nonviolent. The Gaza Great March of Return is regularly
recast as a "violent movement" or a "cover for terrorism"; the BDS
movement is "an existential threat to the existence of the state."

Meanwhile, up on the Hill

[The Leahy Laws allow for waivers: if a country fails the vetting
process, State Department may call for an exception if the foreign
government "has taken all necessary corrective steps," or in the event
of "humanitarian or national security emergencies." DOD can also waive
the prohibition on funding in "extraordinary circumstances"; in such
cases, the Secretary of Defense is required by law to report to Congress
the nature of the GVHR as well as the "circumstances that necessitate
the waiver."]{.underline}

[But with all the human rights violations going on in Israel-Palestine
even today, the Leahy law sits on the shelf.]{.underline}

[Our Congress people (with a few notable exceptions) drink the Koolaid,
take the campaign donations from AIPAC and other lobbies,, and sign the
checks. If they have read the annual Department of State Country Reports
on Human Rights, or the multitude of human rights reports from
nongovernmental organizations, there has been no impact.]{.underline} To
understand why, read They Dare to Speak Out or The Israel Lobby,
(shorter version here).

On the contrary, Congress has pushed through the Taylor Force Act, which
is harmful to Palestinians; both houses are currently entertaining
anti-BDS laws --the House version contains strong wording that opposes a
United Nations Human Rights Council resolution.

When the TV cameras are rolling, or the lobbyists are outside the door
(read: all the time), it would appear that our Congressional
representatives do not really believe in human rights after all -- at
least when those humans are Palestinian.

#### Israel is blatantly misusing arms from the U.S. to commit human rights violations

**Kane, 18**- freelance journalist who writes on Israel/Palestine and
civil liberties (Alex \"American Laws Can Help Stop Israeli Massacres in
Gaza,\" Nation,
<https://www.thenation.com/article/american-laws-can-help-stop-israeli-massacres-in-gaza/>4-13-2018
) ML

The videos that have streamed out of the Gaza Strip over the last two
weeks are disturbing, digital testaments to extreme force and terror.

In one widely circulated video taken on March 30, on the first day of
what has been dubbed the "Great Return March," 19-year-old Abdul Fattah
al-Nabi can be seen running with a tire, his back turned to the Israeli
snipers who have perched on hills overlooking Gaza. Then a shot rings
out and al-Nabi falls to the ground, becoming one of 17 people killed
that day by Israeli snipers who gunned down Palestinians as they
protested Israel's blockade of the enclave and demanded their rights as
refugees.

In another clip, taken on April 6, Palestinian journalist Yasser Murtaja
is seen using a video camera to film Palestinian demonstrators as smoke
from burning tires envelops the area he is in. In the next scene,
Murtaja, who was wearing a vest marked with the words "PRESS," is being
carried by colleagues while he bleeds from an Israeli gunshot wound. He
later died.

As the first of these images began to circulate, the Israeli
human-rights group B'Tselem launched a media campaign with a simple
message aimed at those tasked with responding to Gaza's ongoing protest
encampment. The organization took out ads in Israeli newspapers with the
words "Sorry commander, I cannot shoot"---an attempt to encourage
snipers to "refuse to open fire on unarmed demonstrators," as the group
put it in a statement.

[Thus far, however, B'Tselem's campaign hasn't worked. Israeli snipers
have continued to shoot down unarmed Palestinians protesting near the
fence that cages in Gaza, a practice human-rights groups say is a crime
under international law.]{.underline} And as the Great Return protest
heads into the third of its planned six weeks, rights advocates fear
more deaths and more bloodshed at the hands of the Israeli military.
Already, some 1300 Palestinians have been shot and wounded, and more
than 30 killed.

[But there's another strategy for stemming the bloodshed, one that does
not rely on the conscience of soldiers---and **it starts in the United
States**. Palestinian-rights groups here have begun urging Congress to
demand an investigation into alleged Israeli violations of US laws
governing arms exports, and they are **calling on the State Department
to enforce those laws and cut off the flow of US weapons to
Israel**.]{.underline} These efforts parallel calls by the Palestinian
Boycott National Committee to implement a global arms embargo against
Israel, and a call by British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn for a
review of UK arms sales to Israel, but they keep a tight focus on
Israel's most munificent ally.

The United States gives Israel over \$3 billion in annual military aid
and, under the terms of US-Israeli agreements, 75 percent of that aid
must be spent on US-made weapons. At the same time, [laws governing the
sale of US-made weapons to foreign countries require that these
countries do not misuse this weaponry on civilians. Human-rights groups
say strict enforcement of these laws would send a statement that the
US-Israel alliance is predicated on respect of Palestinian human rights.
They also believe that strict enforcement of these laws could deter
future Israeli human-rights violations.]{.underline}

["The **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [**could send a
very strong message to the Israelis about the unacceptability of these
human-rights abuses by simply making it clear that there's no blank
check when it comes to military support if they engage in behavior like
this,"** said]{.underline} Yousef [Munayyer, executive director of the
US Campaign for Palestinian Rights.]{.underline}

The US Campaign is among the chief groups calling for accountability and
has been encouraging activists to contact members of Congress and call
for "an investigation to hold Israel accountable for violating" laws
that prohibit US-manufactured arms from being used to violate human
rights. Other groups demanding an investigation include the
American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee as well as prominent
human-rights organizations like Amnesty International USA, whose Middle
East and North Africa advocacy director, Raed Jarrar, explained to The
Nation: ["The fact that live ammunition has been used against unarmed
Palestinian protesters might not only be in violation of international
law, it might also violate US law: US military aid cannot be used by
recipient forces to violate human rights."]{.underline}

Amnesty and the US Campaign have focused their calls around two laws in
particular: the Foreign Assistance Act, which prohibits US assistance to
countries that consistently violate human rights, and the Leahy Law, a
provision of the Foreign Assistance Act that prohibits the United States
from sending arms to individual units of foreign security forces that
commit gross human-rights violations[. The Leahy Law is narrower, but
could ultimately prove more effective, some advocates have suggested,
since it may be easier to cut off aid to singular units that misuse US
weaponry than to a whole army]{.underline}. It also helps that Leahy
himself has said, in a statement issued by his office to another
publication, that he wants to know whether his law applies to the
Israeli military units who killed protesters in Gaza.

While it is difficult without investigation to determine what role, if
any, US aid and weapons played in the recent killings at the Gaza
border, experts who monitor US assistance to Israel told me, for a story
published previously in The Intercept, that US aid "of one type or
another" is assumed to benefit virtually all Israeli military units. At
a minimum, images released by the Israel Defense Forces show some of the
rifles that soldiers on the Gaza border are equipped with, and at least
two seem to have a US provenance. According to Sarit Michaeli, who
tracks Israeli weapons as the international advocacy officer for
B'Tselem, one photo shows an Israeli soldier surveying Gaza while
holding a Remington M24 sniper rifle, a gun made in the United States by
the New York--based company Remington Arms. In another photo, a soldier
holds what looks like an SR-25 semiautomatic sniper, a gun made by the
Florida-based Knight's Armament Company.

The Nation asked the Israeli army about whether it was using
US-manufactured weapons like the Remington or SR-25. An army
spokesperson did not respond to those questions, and only said: "The IDF
uses means such as warnings, riot dispersal means, and, as a last resort
firing live rounds in a precise, measured manner. The IDF is committed
to preventing infiltration into Israeli territory and threats against
its troops and Israeli citizens."

[In theory, a finding by the State Department that the Israeli army
extrajudicially killed Palestinians in violation of international
law---as human-rights group allege---could lead the United States to cut
off the flow of arms to Israel.]{.underline} The problem is that theory
and practice rarely, if ever, meet when it comes to the application of
laws governing the sale of US-made weapons. There is too much pressure
from the defense industry and other interest groups, and too little
political will, to enforce these laws---on Israel or on any other allied
country the United States supplies with weaponry, like Saudi Arabia and
Egypt, both of whom also use US weapons to fire indiscriminately on
civilians.

"Recipients of US weapons understand that they're very unlikely to be
held accountable for \[a use of\] US equipment \[that results\] in
civilian casualties," said Brittany Benowitz, an expert on arms-exports
laws who worked as a defense adviser to former senator Russ Feingold[.
"This is creating a perception around the world that the US is
indifferent to human suffering."]{.underline}

There have been occasional exceptions, moments when legislators and even
presidents have made moves, however small, to stanch the flow of arms to
flagrant perpetrators. President Barack Obama, for instance, temporarily
halted the flow of Hellfire missiles to Israel during the country's
deadly assault on Gaza in 2014. (No other US-made weapons were stopped,
however.) The Obama administration also criticized Israel over the
Israeli army's killing of civilians during that assault.

But such interventions are rare, and, in the case of Israel, have grown
even less likely under President Donald Trump, who has fully aligned US
policy with the wishes of Israel's far-right government and promised not
to publicly air disagreements with Israel. Indeed, the Trump
administration has said nothing about Israel's use of deadly force
against unarmed civilians. Instead, Jason Greenblatt, the White House
envoy in charge of Israel/Palestine, criticized the Palestinian
protesters.

As for Congress, only a handful of members have criticized Israel's
actions. The State Department did not respond to requests for comment
from The Nation on whether it was concerned about Israel firing on
unarmed civilians in Gaza, in possible violation of US law.

"That sends a message to the Israelis that the United States is fully
behind the use of lethal force on protesters. That is dangerous," said
Munayyer, the head of the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights. "That the
American administration is shielding an Israeli military engaged in
those kinds of brutally repressive acts is a new low."

Still, Munayyer told The Nation it remained important to press the
United States to enforce its arms-export laws as they apply to Israel.

["This is an opportunity for people to communicate with their
representatives and demand action on this front, because it is a
question of whether or not US law has been violated," he said. "It's an
opportunity for accountability."]{.underline}

#### U.S. arms sales fuels systematic human rights abuses by Israel

**Ruebner, 11** -- national advocacy director of the U.S. Campaign to
End the Israeli Occupation(Josh, \"Hold Israel accountable with Leahy
law,\" TheHill,
<https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/177199-hold-israel-accountable-with-leahy-law>,
8-17-2011 ) ML

In response to an article in the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz suggesting
that the Vermont Senator will attempt to apply sanctions to certain
units of the Israeli military for human rights violations, Carle
explained that "the \[Leahy\] law applies to U.S. aid to foreign
security forces around the globe and is intended to be applied
consistently across the spectrum of U.S. military aid abroad. [Under the
law the State Department is responsible for evaluations and enforcement
decisions and over the years Senator Leahy has pressed for faithful and
consistent application of the law."]{.underline}

The possibility of Senator Leahy consistently applying this eponymous
legislation and holding Israel to the exact same standard as every other
country has Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak, whose office may have
leaked the story in an effort to kill the initiative, in a tizzy.

[The "Leahy Law,"]{.underline} as it is commonly known, [prohibits the
United States from providing any weapons or training to "any unit of the
security forces of a foreign country if the Secretary of State has
credible evidence that such unit has committed gross violations of human
rights."]{.underline} In the past, this law has been invoked to curtail
military aid to countries as diverse as Indonesia, Colombia, Pakistan,
and the Philippines. Along with other provisions in the Foreign
Assistance Act, of which it is a part, and the Arms Export Control Act,
it forms the basis of an across-the-board policy that is supposed to
ensure that U.S. assistance does not contribute to human rights abuses.

Ha'aretz reports that the Senator is looking to invoke this prohibition
regarding "Israel Navy\'s Shayetet 13 unit, the undercover Duvdevan unit
and the Israel Air Force\'s Shaldag unit." [The inclusion of specific
units in the story may indicate that Leahy already has findings from the
Secretary of State that these Israeli military units have committed
human rights abuses.]{.underline}

[If so, then this could be a much-overdue watershed in holding
accountable Israel, the largest recipient of U.S. military aid, for its
**gross misuse of U.S. weapons to commit systematic human rights abuses
of Palestinians** living under Israel's illegal 44-year military
occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza
Strip.]{.underline} During the last decade, on at least five occasions,
Members of Congress have requested the State Department to investigate
Israel's misuse of U.S. weapons; to date, the State Department has
failed to notify publicly the Congress about any such violation. The
State Department also has refused to disclose documents related to these
investigations in response to a long-standing Freedom of Information Act
request filed by the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation.

[It is time to end Israel's impunity and hold up to the light of day the
devastating impact that U.S. weapons transfers have on Palestinian
civilians.]{.underline} From 2000 to 2009, according to research
conducted by the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation and
published at www.weaponstoisrael.org[, the United States appropriated
more than \$24 billion in taxpayer-funded weapons for Israel. With this
munificence, the United States licensed, paid for, and delivered to
Israel more than 670 million weapons and pieces of related military
equipment. In just three years (2007-2009), the United States gave
Israel more than 47 million pieces of ammunition, or enough bullets to
kill every Palestinian living under Israeli military occupation more
than 10 times over.]{.underline}

Tragically, the prospect of Israel misusing these U.S. weapons to kill
Palestinian civilians has been borne out too frequently. According to
the Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem, from September
2000-December 2009, the Israeli military killed 2,969 Palestinians who
took no part in hostilities, including 1,128 children. One such child,
10-year-old Abir Aramin, was killed by a rubber bullet, possibly
supplied by the United States, which was shot into the back of her head
when she was walking home from school.

For the sake of Abir and all Palestinians who are maimed, killed, or
whose homes, farms, and infrastructure are wantonly destroyed in the
course of Israel's brutal military occupation, the United States must
end taxpayer-funded weapons transfers to Israel Josh Ruebner is the
National Advocacy Director of the US Campaign to End the Israeli
Occupation, a Washington, D.C.-based coalition of several hundred
anti-Israel groups from across the United States. [The US Campaign is
one of the primary organizers of anti-Israel strategies and initiatives
in the U.S. and is a driving force behind the campaign to end U.S.
foreign aid to Israel.]{.underline}

#### Arms sales to dictatorships is not limited to just Saudi Arabia and Egypt -- it's the rule rather than the exception

**Whitney, 17** (9/23/17, Rich - attorney, actor, radio commentator and
disk jockey, Illinois Green Party activist and former Green Party
candidate for governor, "US Provides Military Assistance to 73 Percent
of World's Dictatorships,"
<https://truthout.org/articles/us-provides-military-assistance-to-73-percent-of-world-s-dictatorships/>,
accessed on 6/11/19)

For decades, the American people have been repeatedly told by their
government and corporate-run media that acts of war ordered by their
president have been largely motivated by the need to counter acts of
aggression or oppression by "evil dictators." We were told we had to
invade Iraq because Saddam Hussein was an evil dictator. We had to bomb
Libya because Muammar Gaddafi was an evil dictator, bent on unleashing a
"bloodbath" on his own people. Today, of course, we are told that we
should support insurgents in Syria because Bashar al-Assad is an evil
dictator, and we must repeatedly rattle our sabers at North Korea's Kim
Jong-un and Russia's Vladimir Putin because they, too, are evil
dictators.

This is part of the larger, usually unquestioned mainstream corporate
media narrative that the US leads the "Western democracies" in a global
struggle to combat terrorism and totalitarianism and promote democracy.

I set out to answer a simple question: Is it true? [Does the US
government actually oppose dictatorships and champion democracy around
the world, as we are repeatedly told?]{.underline}

The truth is not easy to find, but federal sources do provide an answer:
[No.]{.underline} According to Freedom House's rating system of
political rights around the world, there were 49 nations in the world,
as of 2015, that can be fairly categorized as "dictatorships." As of
fiscal year 2015, the last year for which we have publicly available
data, the federal government of the United States had been providing
military assistance to 36 of them, courtesy of your tax dollars.
[The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[currently supports over 73 percent of the world's
dictatorships!]{.underline}**

Most politically aware people know of some of the more highly publicized
instances of this, such as the tens of billions of dollars' worth of US
military assistance provided to the beheading capital of the world, the
misogynistic monarchy of Saudi Arabia, and the repressive military
dictatorship now in power in Egypt. But [apologists for our nation's
imperialistic foreign policy may try to rationalize such support,
arguing that Saudi Arabia and Egypt are exceptions to the rule. They may
argue that our broader national interests in the Middle East require
temporarily overlooking the oppressive nature of those particular
states, in order to serve a broader, pro-democratic
endgame.]{.underline}

Such hogwash could be critiqued on many counts, of course, beginning
with its class-biased presumptions about what constitutes US "national
interests." But **[my survey of US support for dictatorships around the
world demonstrates that our government's support for Saudi Arabia and
Egypt are not exceptions to the rule at all. They are the
rule.]{.underline}**

### Arms Sales Morally Bankrupt

Business Management as well as an Examiner for A Level History and
Business; Making a Killing: The Scourge of the Global Arms Trade; p.
57-58 //GBS Rudolph)

The arms trade has had adverse consequences on many nations. **[The arms
trade is immoral and cannot really be justified in any way. It does not
do any good to the human race where millions of people are dying due to
wars, poverty, hunger, lack of proper health facilities and
environmental damage caused due to many reasons, mainly
war.]{.underline}**

The arms trade won\'t stop unless people will unite themselves and say
strong \'NO\' for the corruption. [People need to realise that this
problem must be solved,]{.underline} otherwise [it will get only
worst.]{.underline} If we will let it happen, [we will fight for the
countries or country which never cared about any human rights or better
future. **It never been our fight, it never been our war**.]{.underline}
People want to live peacefully and arms should be used only to make sure
people are safe and secure. [Arms must be limited and have positive
impact using it to reduce crime level inside and outside the
countries.]{.underline} Instead of spending billions [governments could
use the money to raise economy and help pure countries. If money would
be used wisely, we would face brighter future with new technologies,
which would help us to invent and explore. Every regular person should
care more about the issues which stays in the shadow.]{.underline}

The arms trade has shown us that the developed world supplies more arms
than aid to the developing nations, therefore contributing more to
conflict. [The arms trade has helped many developing governments to
build up a mighty military machine to crush internal opposition, to
threaten neighbouring countries or to supporters for new
territory]{.underline} (as in the case of Iraq\'s invasion of Kuwait).
[To that extent it has made the world a more dangerous and bloody
place.]{.underline}

Moreover, it was revealed how [the trade exacerbates conflict, promotes
human rights abuses and worsens poverty in developing
countries]{.underline}. The **[most obvious adverse impact of the arms
trade on health is loss of life and maiming from the use of weapons in
conflicts]{.underline}**. [Developed countries suffer damage to their
health and human services when considerable resources are diverted to
military expenditure]{.underline}. However, [the relative impact of
military expenditures and conflict on developing countries is much
higher, and often catastrophic, **by depriving a large portion of the
population of essential food, shelter, medicine, economic opportunities
and education**]{.underline}. Furthermore, [the physical and
psychological damage inflicted specifically on children is harmful ---
through loss of]{.underline} (or separation from) [families, loss of
education, destruction of homes, **exposure to murder and other
violence, sexual abuse, abduction, torture, slavery, and forcible
conscription as soldiers.**]{.underline}

[The money used to buy arms can instead be used to solve the world
problems. The amount of money the world spends on arms if used for
humanitarian needs would wipe out all diseases/poverty and hunger in
many countries in the world. **The arms trade is in no doubt but immoral
the buying and selling of arms cannot be morally
justified.**]{.underline}

### Arms Sales =\> Increased Conflicts

#### U.S. weapons allow governments to engage in [war crimes]{.underline} and [perpetuate bloody civil wars]{.underline} 

**Thrall and Dorminey 18** (A. Trevor Thrall and Caroline Dorminey; A.

and Government at George Mason University and a senior fellow at the
Cato Institute. Caroline Dorminey is a policy analyst at the Cato
Institute; 3-13-2018; \"Risky Business: The Role of Arms Sales in U.S.

Three important observations immediately emerge from the analysis.
First, there are a large number of risky customers in the world, and the
United States sells weapons to most of them. Thirty-five nations (21
percent) scored in the highest-risk category on at least two metrics,
and 72 (43 percent) were in the highest-risk category on at least one of
the five measures. There simply are not that many safe bets when it
comes to the arms trade.

Second, the data provide compelling evidence that the United States does
not discriminate between high- and low-risk customers. The average sales
to the riskiest nations are higher than those to the least risky
nations. Considering discrete components of the index, for example, the
22 countries coded as "highest risk" on the Global Terrorism Index
bought an average of \$1.91 billion worth of American weapons. The 28
countries in active, high-level conflicts bought an average of \$2.94
billion worth of arms.

[Applying our risk assessment framework to the list of 16 nations
currently banned from buying American weapons helps illustrate the
validity of our approach.]{.underline} The average score of banned
nations is 11.6, with 12 nations scoring 10 or higher. [The
highest-scoring nations were Syria, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic
of the Congo, with Iran, Eritrea, and the Central African Republic not
far behind. Clearly these are nations to which the United States should
not be selling weapons.]{.underline} **[What is especially troubling is
that the United States sold weapons to several of these countries in the
years right before sales were banned, when most of the risks were
readily apparent]{.underline}**. Moreover, America's customer list
includes 32 countries with a risk score above the average of those on
the banned list. This reinforces our concern that the U.S. government
does not block sales to countries that clearly pose a risk of negative
consequences.

The third major observation is [that this lack of discrimination is
dangerous]{.underline}. As simple as it is, **[our risk assessment is a
useful guide to forecasting negative consequences.]{.underline}** The
five countries that scored as high risk on all five measures provide a
clear illustration of the risks of arms sales. This group, which
purchased an average of \$1.8 billion in U.S. weapons since 9/11,
includes Libya, Iraq, Yemen, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and
Sudan[. These five countries, recall, are classified by the various
metrics as: "terror everywhere," "not free," "most fragile," "large
impact from terrorism," and as being involved in high-level
conflicts]{.underline}. These **[governments have used their American
weapons to promote oppression, commit human rights abuses, and
perpetuate bloody civil wars]{.underline}**.

Within the Very Risky category, each country rated as "highest risk" on
at least one measure, and 30 scored as "highest risk" on at least two
measures. [This group also represents the full range of unintended
consequences from arms sales. Afghanistan, Egypt, Somalia, and Ukraine
fall into this category. This]{.underline} group collectively spent an
average of \$1.38 billion over the time period. [Since 9/11, the Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia]{.underline} (which scored a 12) [invaded Yemen,
intervened in Tunisia and Syria, and provoked a crisis with Qatar, while
cementing a track record of human rights abuses and government
oppression. Other states in this category, such as
Afghanistan]{.underline} (score of 14), [have entangled the United
States in counterproductive conflicts since 9/11 and continue to do so
today.]{.underline}

Even arms sales to the less risky nations do not come without risk. For
example, the Somewhat Risky category includes the United Arab Emirates,
which is involved in an active conflict in Yemen, as well as Georgia,
which has dangerous neighbors. Finally, the Lowest Risk category
includes most of the NATO nations, Taiwan, South Korea, and a range of
other, mostly smaller nations with stable governments, such as Barbados
and Grenada, located in friendly neighborhoods. These countries pose
little risk for problems like dispersion, destabilization, or misuse of
weapons for oppression. In some cases, however, arms sales could alter
regional balances of power in ways that increase tensions and the chance
of conflict. U.S. arms sales to NATO allies, as part of the European
Reassurance Initiative, for example, have upset Russian
leaders.[14](about:blank#_idTextAnchor014) Similarly, arms sales to
Taiwan, itself not a risky customer, have nonetheless raised tensions
between China and the United States.[15](about:blank#_idTextAnchor015)

In short, [**even a relatively simple risk assessment makes it clear
that the policy of the United States is to sell weapons to just about
any nation that can afford them without much concern for the
consequences.** Though the United States does limit its most advanced
weapons to allies and maintains a ban on the sale of materials related
to weapons of mass
destruction]{.underline},[17](about:blank#_idTextAnchor017) [the United
States has sold just about everything else, in many cases to countries
**embroiled in interstate and civil conflicts**, to countries with
**horrendous human rights records**, and to countries that **represent a
risk for entangling the United States in unwanted
conflicts.**]{.underline}

#### US arms nations in ethnic conflicts \-\-- risk assessments failing

**Thrall and Dorminey 18** (A. Trevor Thrall and Caroline Dorminey; A.

Accessed: 6-24-2019 //GBS Rudolph)

Historically, [the United States has sold weapons to almost any nation
that wanted to buy them]{.underline} --- suggesting **[that the risk
assessment process is rigged to not find risk]{.underline}**. From 2002
to 2016, America delivered \$197 billion in weapons to 167 states
worldwide.[6](about:blank#_idTextAnchor006) Thirty-two of these
countries purchased at least \$1 billion in arms. The Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia was America's biggest client, purchasing \$25.8 billion worth of
weapons --- including F-15s and a litany of helicopters, naval assets,
and associated munitions. As shown in Table 1, [the top 10 clients
collectively bought \$124 billion in arms --- accounting for roughly
two-thirds of the value of America's total global exports since 2002.
Given the amount of chaos, instability, and conflict in the world, it is
difficult to imagine what sort of process would assess as many as 167 of
the world's roughly 200 countries as safe bets to receive American
weapons.]{.underline}

Moreover, the United States has a long history of selling weapons to
nations where the immediate risks were obvious. From 1981 to 2010, the
United States sold small arms and light weapons to 59 percent and major
conventional weapons to 35 percent of countries actively engaged in a
high-level conflict. The United States sold small arms to 66 percent and
major conventional weapons to 40 percent of countries actively engaged
in a low-level conflict.[7](about:blank#_idTextAnchor007) As one author
noted, [in 1994 there were 50 ongoing ethnic and territorial conflicts
in the world and the United States had armed at least one side in 45 of
them]{.underline}. Since 9/11, the United States has sold weapons to at
least two dyads in conflict: Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and Turkey and the
Kurds.[8](about:blank#_idTextAnchor008)

### Arms Sales =\> Security Tensions 

#### **US arms have virtually no influence in** practice \-\-- they heighten security tensions

The Uncertain and Limited Benefits of Arms Sales

**[Attempts to manage the balance of power and generate influence around
the world are heavily contingent on a number of factors, most of which
lie outside American control]{.underline}**. Upon closer review, [most
of the benefits of arms sales are less certain and less compelling than
advocates claim.]{.underline}

Managing the Balance of Power: The Illusion of Control. [The hidden
assumption underlying the balance of power strategy is that the United
States will be able to predict accurately what the impact of its arms
sales will be]{.underline}. If the goal is deterrence, for example,
**[the assumption is that an arms sale will be sufficient to deter the
adversary without spawning an arms race.]{.underline}** [If the goal is
to promote stability, the assumption is that an arms sale will in fact
reduce tensions and inhibit conflict rather than inflame tensions and
help initiate conflict]{.underline}. These assumptions, in turn, depend
on both the recipient nation and that nation's neighbors and adversaries
acting in ways that don't make things worse.

As it turns out, these are often poor assumptions. [Although arms sales
certainly enhance the military capability of the recipient nation, the
fundamental problem is that arms sales often initiate a long chain of
responses that the United States generally cannot control]{.underline}.
The **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, after all, **[is
not the only country with interests in regional balances]{.underline}**,
especially [where the survival and security of local actors is at
stake]{.underline}. [The United States is neither the only major power
with a keen interest in critical regions like Asia and the Middle
East]{.underline}, nor the only source of weapons and other forms of
assistance. Nor can it dictate the perceptions, interests, or actions of
the other nations involved in a given region. For example, [though a
nation receiving arms from the United States may enjoy enhanced
defensive capabilities, it is also likely to enjoy enhanced offensive
capabilities]{.underline}. With these, a nation's calculations about the
potential benefits of war, intervention abroad, or even the use of force
against its own population may shift decisively. Saudi Arabia's recent
behavior illustrates this dynamic. Though the Saudis explain their arms
purchases as necessary for defense against Iranian pressure, Saudi
Arabia has also spent the past two years embroiled in a military
intervention in Yemen.

Likewise, **[arms sales can heighten regional security
dilemmas]{.underline}**. [Neighbors of nations buying major conventional
weapons will also worry about what this enhanced military capability
will mean]{.underline}. This raises the chances that they too will seek
to arm themselves further, or [take other steps to shift the balance of
power back in their favor, or, in the extreme case, to launch a
preventive war before they are attacked]{.underline}. Given these
dynamics, **[the consequences of arms sales to manage regional balances
of power are far less predictable and often much less positive than
advocates assume.]{.underline}**[54](about:blank#_idTextAnchor054)

This unpredictability characterizes even straightforward-seeming efforts
to manage the balance of power. [The most basic claim of arms sales
advocates is that U.S. arms sales to friendly governments and allies
should make them better able to deter adversaries]{.underline}. The best
available evidence, however, suggests a more complicated reality. In a
study of arms sales from 1950 to 1995, major-power arms sales to
existing allies had no effect on the chance that the recipient would be
the target of a military attack. Worse, recipients of U.S. arms that
were not treaty allies were significantly more likely to become
targets.[55](about:blank#_idTextAnchor055)

Nor is **[there much evidence that arms sales can help the United States
promote peace and regional stability by calibrating the local balance of
power]{.underline}**. On this score, in fact, the evidence suggests that
the default assumption should be the opposite. [Most scholarly work
concludes that arms sales exacerbate instability and increase the
likelihood of
conflict]{.underline}.[56](about:blank#_idTextAnchor056) One study, for
example, found that during the Cold War, U.S. and Soviet arms sales to
hostile dyads (e.g., India/Pakistan, Iran/Iraq, Ethiopia/Somalia)
"**[contributed to hostile political relations and imbalanced military
relationships" and were "profoundly
destabilizing.]{.underline}**"[57](about:blank#_idTextAnchor057)

There is also good reason to believe that several factors are making the
promotion of regional stability through arms sales more difficult. The
shrinking U.S. military advantage over other powers such as China and
the increasingly competitive global arms market both make it less likely
that U.S. arms sales can make a decisive difference. As William Hartung
argued as early as 1990, "the notion of using arms transfers to maintain
a carefully calibrated regional balance of power seems increasingly
archaic in today's arms market, in which a potential U.S. adversary is
as likely to be receiving weapons from U.S. allies like Italy or France
as it is from former or current
adversaries."[58](about:blank#_idTextAnchor058)

In sum, [the academic and historical evidence indicates that although
the United States can use arms sales to enhance the military
capabilities of other nations and thereby shift the local and regional
balance of power, its ability to dictate specific outcomes through such
efforts is severely limited]{.underline}.

Arms for (Not That Much) Influence. Successful foreign policy involves
encouraging other nations to behave in ways that benefit the United
States. As noted, the United States has often attempted to use arms
sales to generate the sort of leverage or influence necessary to do
this. History reveals, however, that the benefits of the arms for
influence strategy are limited for two main reasons.

First, [the range of cases in which arms sales can produce useful
leverage is much narrower than is often imagined]{.underline}. Most
obviously, arms sales are unnecessary in situations where the other
country already agrees or complies with the American position or can be
encouraged to do so without such incentives. This category includes most
U.S. allies and close partners under many, though not all,
circumstances.

Just as clearly, [the arms for influence strategy is a nonstarter when
the other state will never agree to comply with American demands. This
category includes a small group of obvious cases such as Russia, China,
Iran, and other potential adversaries]{.underline} (to which the United
States does not sell weapons anyway), [but it also includes a much
larger group of cases in which the other state opposes what
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[wants, or in which complying with U.S. wishes would be politically too
dangerous for that state's
leadership]{.underline}.[59](about:blank#_idTextAnchor059)

#### Arms sales don't increase US security -- politicians use it as a ploy for support

**Thrall and Dorminey 18** (A. Trevor Thrall and Caroline Dorminey; A.
Trevor Thrall is an associate professor at the Schar School of Policy
and Government at George Mason University and a senior fellow at the
Cato Institute. Caroline Dorminey is a policy analyst at the Cato

Foreign Policy\"; Cato Institute;

Accessed: 6-24-2019 //GBS Rudolph)

The Case against Arms Sales

[Under the right circumstances, we agree that arms sales can be a useful
tool of foreign policy]{.underline}. More often, however, we argue that
the benefits of U.S. arms sales are too uncertain and too limited to
outweigh the negative consequences they often produce. Though presidents
like them because they are relatively easy to use, in most cases arms
sales are not the best way to achieve U.S. foreign policy objectives.
[The strategic case for radically reducing arms sales rests on four
related arguments. First, arms sales **do little to enhance American
security**]{.underline}. Second, [the nonsecurity benefits are far more
limited and uncertain than arms sales advocates
acknowledge.]{.underline} Third, the negative and unwanted consequences
of arms sales are more common and more dangerous than most realize.
Finally, [the United States would enjoy significant diplomatic benefits
from halting arms sales.]{.underline}

**[Arms Sales Provide Little Direct Benefit to U.S. National
Security]{.underline}**

At the strategic level, the United States inhabits such an extremely
favorable security environment in the post-Cold War world that most arms
sales do little or nothing to improve its security. [Thanks to its
geography, friendly]{.underline} (and weak) [neighbors, large and
dynamic economy, and secure nuclear arsenal, the United States faces
very few significant threats.]{.underline} There is no Soviet Union bent
upon dominating Europe and destroying the United States. China, despite
its rapid rise, cannot (and has no reason to) challenge the sovereignty
or territorial integrity of the United States. [Arms sales --- to allies
or others --- are unnecessary to deter major, direct threats to U.S.
national security in the current
era.]{.underline}[47](about:blank#_idTextAnchor047)

Nor are arms sales necessary to protect the United States from "falling
dominoes," or the consequences of conflicts elsewhere. The United States
enjoys what Eric Nordlinger called "strategic immunity." Simply put,
[most of what happens in the rest of the world is irrelevant to U.S.
national security]{.underline}. The United States has spent decades
helping South Korea keep North Korea in check, for example, but division
of territory on the Korean peninsula does not affect America's security.
Likewise, civil wars in the Middle East and Russia's annexation of
Crimea might be significant for many reasons, but those events do not
threaten the ability of the United States to defend itself. As a result,
a **[decision to sell weapons to Ukraine, Taiwan, or South Korea could
significantly affect those nations' security; doing so is not an act of
ensuring U.S. national security.]{.underline}**

### Solves Dangerous Transfers

#### [Regulating]{.underline} arms transfers by [integrating]{.underline} and [enforcing]{.underline} human rights standards into the law prevents dangerous transfers

**Musa, 17** \-\-- Lecturer in International Law at The University of
Manchester, UK (Winter 2017, Shavana, Journal of Conflict & Security
Law, "The Saudi-Led Coalition in Yemen, Arms Exports and Human Rights:
Prevention Is Better Than Cure," doi:10.1093/jcsl/krx013, JMP)

5\. Concluding Remarks

[The link between violations of human rights and humanitarian law and
security has been established]{.underline} by many, with its recognition
rising rapidly.149 It is apparent that [such **violations can often lead
to the prolongation of civil war and high numbers of lost civilian
lives**]{.underline}. One of the ways in which national and
international security can be strengthened is through the proper
regulation of the arms trade. With this, human rights should be more
comprehensively integrated into the way in which States assess
transfers. While the ATT prescribes this, **[the importance of human
rights is]{.underline}** **[also evident in national legal
frameworks]{.underline}**.

This article has focused on the national arms regulation of the UK and
the USA, given their sale of arms to Saudi Arabia. [While international
treaties and both national legal systems explicitly require a
consideration of human rights before an arms transfer is authorized, it
is difficult to establish how stringent these national frameworks are in
practice.]{.underline} Both the UK and the USA have **[secretive
licensing procedures, making]{.underline}** their [**practices quite
opaque**.]{.underline} A mere analysis of the law is not indicative of
how the UK and the USA have in fact applied it. **[The lack of cohesion
between the law and the practice is evident]{.underline}** [from arms
transfers to Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, where violations of human rights
and humanitarian law have meant the loss of countless innocent lives.
[It is crucial that for countries like the UK and the USA to avoid these
types of violations for the protection of civilians, that **they more
stringently apply the law, fully integrating particular measures in the
process**]{.underline}, as outlined in the previous section. **[In not
doing so, would leave the law as a hollow feckless gesture, with rights,
but no realization.]{.underline}**

### Solves Complicity

#### Human rights often take a back seat to other considerations -- plan would resolve complicity

accessed on 6/8/19, JMP)

1\. Review all pending and future arms sales to consider potential human
rights risks. [Although considering the human rights impact of U.S. arms
sales is mandated by U.S. law, **human rights often take a back seat to
other policy considerations when determining whether to authorize an
arms sale**.]{.underline} Indeed current [Chair of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee]{.underline}, Senator Bob [Corker,
announced]{.underline} recently that [human rights concerns do not
belong in arms transfer decisions and could be dealt with in other
ways]{.underline}. However, [**conditioning arms sales to ensure that
human rights are protected helps uphold U.S. foreign policy values,
protects U.S. industry from complicity in human rights abuses**, and
ultimately serves key strategic interests]{.underline}.

### Solves Countries Behavior

#### Arms embargoes can successfully change countries' behavior

**Miller & Binder, 19** \-\-- \*deputy director for policy at the
Project on Middle East Democracy and served as the director for Egypt
and Israel military issues at the U.S. National Security Council from
2014 to 2017, AND \*\*advocacy officer at the Project on Middle East
Democracy (5/10/19, Andrew & Seth, "The Case for Arms Embargoes Against
Uncooperative Partners,"
<https://warontherocks.com/2019/05/the-case-for-arms-embargoes-against-uncooperative-partners/>,
accessed on 5/27/19, JMP)

The efficacy of withholding military assistance, including grant aid and
arms sales, to modify the behavior of recipient countries is a hotly
debated topic in the U.S. foreign policy community. Last month, War on
the Rocks published another contribution to this discussion. In "The
Case Against Arms Embargos, Even for Saudi Arabia," Raymond
[Rounds]{.underline} opposes what he calls an "arms embargo" on Saudi
Arabia, arguing that suspending U.S. arms sales as leverage over policy
disagreements will only backfire by driving the kingdom to purchase arms
from other countries. He [contends that suspending sales to Saudi Arabia
will fail to alter objectionable Saudi conduct]{.underline}, whether in
Yemen or domestically, [while "\[damaging\] ties with Saudi
Arabia."]{.underline} According to Rounds, this dynamic is not unique to
Saudi Arabia, but a general proposition that applies to all U.S. arms
recipients.

If he is correct, arms embargoes --- a regular tool of U.S. foreign
policy --- are quixotic attempts to shape the behavior of foreign
governments and put the United States at a strategic disadvantage to
global competitors. While this argument seems reasonable, if depressing,
it suffers from two principal and serious flaws.

First, **[the empirical record does not support Rounds' contention that
arms embargoes do not deliver]{.underline}**. [While]{.underline} these
[suspensions are not a silver bullet, **there is ample evidence to
demonstrate that they can be effective in changing the policy of a
target country**]{.underline}. For example, [in]{.underline}
20[05]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [successfully used the suspension of a joint
weapons project to persuade Israel to cancel a proposed sale of drone
equipment to China]{.underline}. In another example, then-Secretary of
State Rex Tillerson secured commitments from Egypt to resolve a
longstanding criminal case against 41 foreign NGO workers, including
Americans and Europeans, and to suspend military cooperation with North
Korea in exchange for releasing \$195 million in suspended military aid.
[More recently, the legislative hold]{.underline} Sen. Robert [Menendez
placed on an arms sale to Saudi Arabia and the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[A]{.underline}**rab
**[E]{.underline}**mirates, [when combined with threatened legislation
to impose further restrictions on transfers to Saudi Arabia, helped
pressure the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen to re-engage in negotiations
with the Houthis, resulting in an imperfect but still important deal on
the port of Hodeidah.]{.underline}

[The author's argument that arms embargoes do not work cites the 2013
suspension of U.S. military aid to Egypt]{.underline} following that
country's military coup. This policy clearly failed to reverse the
military coup led by current President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, but there
are good reasons to question the validity of the example. Proponents of
[the suspension]{.underline} argue with good reason that it [was not
given a fair chance to work]{.underline}. Shortly after the decision was
announced, **[senior U.S. officials told the Egyptians the aid would
soon be restored, undercutting the coercive value of the
suspension]{.underline}**. [From the perspective of the Egyptian
government, it would have been irrational to make serious concessions in
response to what they believed was an idle threat.]{.underline} Just as
important, due to a plethora of exceptions and carve-outs, some U.S.
military assistance to Egypt continued throughout the suspension period,
including maintenance and sustainment, sparing the Egyptian military
from the full force of the hold.

[**Despite undercutting its own suspension, the hold still produced some
good.** U.S. diplomats were able to leverage the policy to deter the
Egyptian government from enforcing an arbitrary September 2014 deadline
for NGOs to register under Egypt's draconian 2002 NGO law.]{.underline}
And, [although Egypt released U.S. citizen Mohamed Soltan from prison
two months after aid was resumed, **Cairo was partly motivated by the
concern that**]{.underline} the **[Obama]{.underline}** administration
**[could reverse its decision to resume arms shipments]{.underline}**.
To be sure, these accomplishments were relatively limited, and we should
be careful not to overestimate the efficacy of arms holds. [A foreign
government is unlikely to fundamentally change its position on what it
views as an existential issue. But **prior suspensions have yielded
tangible gains**, and they should remain part of the U.S. foreign policy
toolkit.]{.underline}

### Conventional Conflict Impacts

#### Conventional warfare kills hundreds of millions of soldiers, civilians, men, women, and children, inflicts severe psychological trauma, and drives mass refugee crises

**Hedges 3** -- Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, a New York Times
best-selling author, a professor in the college degree program offered
to New Jersey state prisoners by Rutgers University (Chris Hedges,
7-6-2003, \"\'What Every Person Should Know About War\',\" New York
Times,
https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/06/books/chapters/what-every-person-should-know-about-war.html/,
DOA: 7-1-2019, smarx ) //SS

What is a war? War is defined as an active conflict that has claimed
more than 1,000 lives. Has the world ever been at peace? Of the past
3,400 years, humans have been entirely at peace for 268 of them, or just
8 percent of recorded history. How many people have died in war? **[At
least 108 million people were killed in wars in the twentieth
century]{.underline}**. [Estimates for the total number killed in wars
throughout all of human history range from 150 million to 1
billion]{.underline}. War has several other effects on population,
including decreasing the birthrate by taking men away from their wives.
The reduced birthrate during World War II is estimated to have caused a
population deficit of more than 20 million people. How many people
around the world serve in the military? The combined armed forces of the
world have 21.3 million people. China has the world\'s largest, with 2.4
million. America is second with 1.4 million. India has 1.3 million,
North Korea 1 million, and Russia 900,000. Of the world\'s 20 largest
militaries, 14 are in developing nations? How many wars are taking place
right now? At the beginning of 2003 there were 30 wars going on around
the world. These included conflicts in Afghanistan, Algeria, Burundi,
China, Colombia, the Congo, India, Indonesia, Israel, Iraq, Liberia,
Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Somalia, Sudan, and
Uganda. Is there a genetic reason why we fight? There is no single \"war
gene.\" Combinations of genes can predispose a person to violence.
However, aggression is a product of biology and environment. In America,
sources of aggressive dispositions include domestic violence, the
portrayal of violence in the media, threats from enemies, and combat
training. Is war essentially male? Worldwide, 97 percent of today\'s
military personnel are male. This is thought to be a reflection of
culture and biology. Fifteen percent (204,000) of American military
personnel are female. Can women fight as effectively as men do? Yes.
While fewer women are \"natural killers,\" and women are on average
smaller than men, there are many women who have the psychological makeup
and the physical ability to fight. There are many men without either.
Women have shown valor in combat. Dr. Mary Walker won the Medal of Honor
during the Civil War. Why are civilians so attracted to war? War is
often regarded by observers as honorable and noble. It can be viewed as
a contest between nations, a chance to compete and be declared the
victor. Does the American public support war? Between 65 and 85 percent
of the American public will support a military action when it begins.
Vietnam had 64 percent support in 1965. As American casualties mount,
support often decreases. The Korean and Vietnam Wars ended with support
levels near 30 percent. World War II support levels never fell below 77
percent, despite the prolonged and damaging nature of the conflict. The
Gulf War enjoyed similar levels of support. How large is the American
military? The active peacetime force of the U.S. armed services includes
1.4 million people, with the Army making up almost 500,000 of that
number. The Navy has approximately 380,000 men and women on active duty.
The Air Force has approximately 365,000, and the Marines have
approximately 175,000. Approximately 1.3 million Americans serve in
Reserve and National Guard branches that can be activated in time of
war. How many Americans have died in wars? **[More than 650,000
Americans have been killed in combat]{.underline}**. **[Another 243,000
have died while wars were being fought, due to training accidents,
injury, and disease]{.underline}**. In the twentieth century,
approximately 53,000 Americans were killed in combat in World War I,
291,000 in World War II, 33,000 in the Korean War, 47,000 in Vietnam,
and 148 in the Gulf War. Including deaths from disease, accidents, and
other factors, each war\'s total was much higher: approximately 116,000
died in World War I, 400,000 in World War II, 53,000 in the Korean War,
90,000 in Vietnam, and almost 400 in the Gulf War. How deadly is the
American military? It is difficult to measure how many enemy deaths
American armed forces have inflicted. [Americans and their allies
typically cause 10 to 20 times more combat casualties than American
forces suffer]{.underline}. Estimates of Iraqi soldiers killed in the
Gulf War range from 1,500 to 100,000. The lowest figure would still be
10 times the number of Americans killed in the war. **[Approximately
850,000 Vietcong died in the Vietnam War, 18 times the 47,000 U.S. dead.
More than 600,000 North Korean and 1 million Chinese fighters died in
the Korean War, almost 50 times the 33,000 American dead]{.underline}**.
**[In World War II, 3,250,000 German and 1,507,000 Japanese soldiers,
sailors, and pilots were killed]{.underline}**, 16 times the 291,000
American servicemen who were killed. How much does it cost the United
States to maintain its armed forces? Since 1975, America has spent
between 3 and 6 percent of its gross domestic product on national
defense, or approximately 15 to 30 percent of each year\'s federal
budget. In the first years of the twenty-first century, this meant
spending roughly \$350 billion per year. In comparison, annual spending
for other programs included roughly \$15 billion on state and
international assistance and \$60 billion on education. From 1940 to
1996 (a period that includes several cycles of war and peace, including
the arms race of the cold war), America spent \$16.23 trillion on the
military (\$5.82 trillion of that on nuclear weapons), versus \$1.70
trillion on health care and \$1.24 trillion on international affairs.
How much does war cost? The cost of the Gulf War was approximately \$76
billion. Vietnam cost \$500 billion; the Korean War, \$336 billion; and
World War II, almost \$3 trillion. Put another way, the Gulf War cost
each person in the United States \$306; Vietnam, \$2,204 per person;
Korea, \$2,266 per person; and World War II, \$20,388 per person. At its
outset, estimates for the cost of the Iraqi War were \$50 to \$140
billion, and an additional \$75 to \$500 billion for occupation and
peacekeeping, or from \$444 to \$2,274 per person. How big is the
military industry in the United States? Besides the 1.4 million active
duty personnel, the military employs 627,000 civilians. The defense
industry employs another 3 million. In total, the military and its
supporting manufacturing base employs 3.5 percent of the U.S. labor
force. In 2002, the Department of Defense spent \$170.8 billion with
military contractors such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin. How has the
size of the industry changed over time? The 2003 level of 3.5 percent of
the labor force is historically low. In 1987, toward the end of the cold
war, defense (including the military) made up 5.7 percent of the U.S.
labor market; in 1968, during Vietnam, 9.8 percent; in 1943, during
World War II, 39 percent. After World War II, defense employment dropped
to 4.5 percent, but jumped back to 11 percent in 1951 with the Korean
War and the start of the cold war. Does the military industry help make
defense spending decisions? Yes. In 2000, defense lobbying groups spent
approximately \$60 million. Defense political action committees also
contribute roughly \$14 million per congressional election cycle.
Defense aerospace, defense electronics, and miscellaneous defense are
the 31st-, 44th-, and 46th-ranking industries, respectively. How many
weapons does the U.S. military industry export each year? In 2001, U.S.
arms manufacturers exported \$9.7 billion in weapons worldwide. The
United Kingdom was second in international exports with \$4 billion. In
addition, the United States made new sales of \$12.1 billion. Russia was
second with \$5.8 billion. The United States is the world\'s largest
arms manufacturer, supplying almost half of all the arms sold on the
world market. What kinds of arms does the United States export? In 2002,
U.S. manufacturers planned to export arms including Cobra and Apache
attack helicopters, Black Hawk helicopters, KC-135A Stratotanker
air-to-air tanker/transport aircraft, Hellfire and Hellfire II
air-to-surface antiarmor missiles, Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, TOW
2A and 2B missiles, M-16 rifles, M-60 machine guns, grenade launchers,
MK-82 (500 lb.) and MK-83 (1,000 lb.) bombs, Sentinel radar systems,
GBU12 Paveway series laser-guided bombs, standard assault amphibious
personnel vehicles, assault amphibious command vehicles, and CBU-97
sensor fused weapon antitank cluster bombs. How many of the weapons U.S.
companies export go to developing countries? Approximately half. From
1994 to 2001, the United States exported \$131 billion in arms, with
\$59 billion going to developing nations. The United States is the
leading exporter to developing countries, with Russia and France second
and third. How do American arms exports affect the American people? Arms
exports are an important source of American jobs and help maintain U.S.
military manufacturing capacity. They also have some negative
consequences. When American weapons are used in a conflict-for example,
by Israel against the Palestinians-America is also blamed for the
attacks. U.S. forces regularly find themselves up against sophisticated
weaponry of American origin, which is harder to defend against. How
dangerous is war for civilians? Very dangerous. **[Between 1900 and
1990]{.underline}**, **[43 million soldiers died in wars. During the
same period, 62 million civilians were killed]{.underline}**. **[More
than 34 million civilians died in World War II]{.underline}**. **[One
million died in North Korea. Hundreds of thousands were killed in South
Korea, and 200,000 to 400,000 in Vietnam. In the wars of the 1990s,
civilian deaths constituted between 75 and 90 percent of all war
deaths.]{.underline}** What is **[the civilian experience in
war]{.underline}**? **[They are shot, bombed, raped, starved, and driven
from their homes]{.underline}**. During World War II, 135,000 civilians
died in two days in the firebombing of Dresden. A week later, in
Pforzheim, Germany, 17,800 people were killed in 22 minutes. In Russia,
after the three-year battle of Leningrad, only 600,000 civilians
remained in a city that had held a population of 2.5 million. One
million were evacuated, 100,000 were conscripted into the Red Army, and
800,000 died. In April 2003, during the Iraqi War, half of the 1.3
million civilians in Basra, Iraq, were trapped for days without food and
water in temperatures in excess of 100 degrees. How many refugees axe
there? In 2001, 40 **[million people were displaced from their homes
because of armed conflict]{.underline}** or human rights violations.
Refugees have been a concern throughout the twentieth century. [Five
million Europeans were uprooted from 1919 to 1939. World War II
displaced 40 million non-Germans in Europe, and 13 million Germans were
expelled from countries in Eastern Europe]{.underline}. Approximately
2.5 million of the 4.4 million people in Bosnia and Herzegovina were
driven from their homes during that region\'s war in the early 1990s.
More than 2 million Rwandans left their country in 1994. In 2001,
200,000 people were driven from Afghanistan to Pakistan. In early 2003,
45,000 Liberians were displaced from their homes. What are the
consequences of becoming a refugee? [Refugees have very high mortality
rates, due primarily to malnutrition and infectious
disease]{.underline}. Rwandan refugees in Zaire in 1994 had a death rate
25 to 50 times higher than prewar Rwandans. Iraqi Kurdish refugees in
Turkey in 1991 had a death rate 18 times higher than usual. How does war
affect children? **[More than 2 million children were killed in wars
during the 1990s. Three times that number were disabled or seriously
injured]{.underline}**. **[Twenty million children were displaced from
their homes in 2001. Many were forced into prostitution. A large
percentage of those will contract AIDS. Children born to mothers who are
raped or forced into prostitution often become outcasts.]{.underline}**
How many child soldiers are there? More than 300,000 worldwide. Soldiers
are sometimes recruited at age 10 and younger. The youngest carry heavy
packs, or sweep roads with brooms and branches to test for landmines.
When children are hostile, the opposing army is more likely to consider
every civilian a potential enemy. Why do children join armies? They are
often forced to. Some are given alcohol or drugs, or exposed to
atrocities, to desensitize them to violence. Some join to help feed or
protect their families. Some are offered up by their parents in exchange
for protection. Children can be fearless because they lack a clear
concept of death. How can war affect women? Women often take on larger
economic roles in wartime. They must find ways to compensate for their
husband\'s military deployment or unemployment. Those in war zones must
search for food, water, medicine, and fuel despite shortages. Some
**[women in war zones are forced into prostitution to provide for their
family. Famine and stress cause increased stillbirth and early infant
death. AIDS risk increases for many women in war, from prostitution,
husbands who return from military duty with HIV, or rape.]{.underline}**

**Avery 15** -- theoretical chemist noted for his research publications
in quantum chemistry, thermodynamics, evolution, and history of science.
Since the early 1990s, Avery has been an active World peace activist

Age Peace Foundation,

The direct and indirect costs of war

**[The costs of war, both direct and indirect, are so enormous that they
are almost beyond comprehension]{.underline}**. Globally, the
institution of war interferes seriously with the use of tax money for
constructive and peaceful purposes.

Today, despite the end of the Cold War, the world spends roughly 1.7
trillion (i.e. 1.7 million million) US dollars each year on armaments.
This colossal flood of money could have been used instead for education,
famine relief, development of infrastructure, or on urgently needed
public health measures.

The World Health Organization lacks funds to carry through an
antimalarial program on as large a scale as would be desirable, but the
entire program could be financed for less that our military
establishments spend in a single day. Five hours of world arms spending
is equivalent to the total cost of the 20-year WHO campaign that
resulted in the eradication of smallpox. For every 100,000 people in the
world, there are 556 soldiers, but only 85 doctors. Every soldier costs
an average of \$20,000 per year, while the average spent on education is
only \$380 per school-aged child. With a diversion of funds consumed by
three weeks of military spending, the world could create a sanitary
water supply for all its people, thus eliminating the cause of almost
half of all human illness.

A new drug-resistant form of tuberculosis has recently become widespread
in Asia and in the former Soviet Union. In order to combat this new and
highly dangerous form of tuberculosis and to prevent its spread, WHO
needs \$500 million, an amount equivalent to 1.2 hours of world arms
spending.

Today's world is one in which roughly ten million children die every
year from starvation or from diseases related to poverty. Besides this
enormous waste of young lives through malnutrition and preventable
disease, there is a huge waste of opportunities through inadequate
education. The rate of illiteracy in the 25 least developed countries is
80%, and the total number of illiterates in the world is estimated to be
800 million. Meanwhile every 60 seconds the world spends \$6.5 million
on armaments.

It is plain that if the almost unbelievable sums now wasted on the
institution of war were used constructively, most of the pressing
problems of humanity could be solved, but today the world spends more
than 20 times as much on war as it does on development.

**[Medical and psychological consequences; loss of life]{.underline}**

While in earlier epochs it may have been possible to confine the effects
of war mainly to combatants, in the 20th century [the victims of war
were increasingly civilians, and especially children]{.underline}. For
example, according to Quincy Wright's statistics, [the First and Second
World Wars cost the lives of 26 million soldiers, but the toll in
civilian lives was much larger: 64 million]{.underline}.

Since the Second World War, [despite the best efforts of the UN, there
have been over 150 armed conflicts]{.underline}; and, if civil wars are
included, there are on any given day an average of 12 wars somewhere in
the world. [In the conflicts in Indo-China, the proportion of civilian
victims was between 80% and 90%,]{.underline} while [in the Lebanese
civil war]{.underline} some sources state that [the proportion of
civilian casualties was as high as 97%.]{.underline}

[Civilian casualties often occur through malnutrition and through
diseases]{.underline} that would be preventable in normal circumstances.
**[Because of the social disruption caused by war, normal supplies of
food, safe water and medicine are interrupted, so that populations
become vulnerable to famine and epidemics.]{.underline}**

http://www.cadmusjournal.org/article/volume-2/issue-2-part-3/lessons-world-war-i

http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/27201-the-leading-terrorist-state

**[Effects of war on children]{.underline}**

According to UNICEF figures, **[90% of the casualties of recent wars
have been civilians, and 50% children]{.underline}**. The organization
estimates that in recent years, **[violent conflicts have driven 20
million children from their homes]{.underline}**. [They have become
refugees or internally displaced persons within their own
countries.]{.underline}

During the last decade **[2 million children have been killed and 6
million seriously injured or permanently disabled as the result of armed
conflicts, while 1 million children have been orphaned or separated from
their families]{.underline}**. Of the ten countries with the highest
rates of death of children under five years of age, seven are affected
by armed conflicts. UNICEF estimates that [300,000 child soldiers are
currently forced to fight in 30 armed conflicts throughout the world.
Many of these have been forcibly recruited or abducted.]{.underline}

Even when they are not killed or wounded by conflicts, **[children often
experience painful psychological traumas]{.underline}**: the [violent
death of parents or close relatives]{.underline}, [separation from their
families]{.underline}, [seeing family members tortured]{.underline},
[displacement from home]{.underline}, [disruption of ordinary
life]{.underline}, [exposure to shelling and other forms of combat,
starvation and anxiety about the future]{.underline}.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2080482/

**[Refugees]{.underline}**

Human Rights Watch estimates that in 2001 there were **[15 million
refugees in the world, forced from their countries by war, civil and
political conflict, or by gross violations of human
rights]{.underline}**. In addition, **[there were an estimated 22
million internally displaced persons, violently forced from their homes
but still within the borders of their countries.]{.underline}**

In 2001, 78% of all refugees came from ten areas: Afghanistan, Angola,
Burma, Burundi, Congo-Kinshasa, Eritria, Iraq, the Palestinian
territories, Somalia and Sudan. A quarter of all refugees are
Palestinians, who make up the world's oldest and largest refugee
population. 45% of the world's refugees have found sanctuaries in Asia,
30% in Africa, 19% in Europe and 5% in North America.

[Refugees who have crossed an international border are in principle
protected by Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights]{.underline}, which affirms their right "to seek and to enjoy in
other countries asylum from persecution". In 1950 the Office of the High
Commissioner for Refugees was created to implement Article 14, and in
1951 the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees was adopted by
the UN. By 2002 this legally binding treaty had been signed by 140
nations. However [the industrialized countries have recently adopted a
very hostile and restrictive attitude towards refugees, subjecting them
to arbitrary arrests, denial of social and economic rights, and even
forcible return to countries in which they face
persecution.]{.underline}

The status of internally displaced persons is even worse than that of
refugees who have crossed international borders. In many cases [the
international community simply ignores their suffering, reluctant to
interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign states.]{.underline} In
fact, the United Nations Charter is self-contradictory in this respect,
since on the one hand it calls for non-interference in the internal
affairs of sovereign states, but on the other hand, people everywhere
are guaranteed freedom from persecution by the Charter's Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.

**[Damage to infrastructure]{.underline}**

Most insurance policies have clauses written in fine print exempting
companies from payment of damage caused by war. The reason for this is
simple[. The damage caused by war is so enormous that insurance
companies could never come near to paying for it without going
bankrupt.]{.underline}

We mentioned above that the world spends roughly a trillion dollars each
year on preparations for war. A similarly colossal amount is needed to
repair the damage to infrastructure caused by war. Sometimes this damage
is unintended, but sometimes it is intentional.

During World War II, one of the main aims of air attacks by both sides
was to destroy the industrial infrastructure of the opponent. This made
some sense in a war expected to last several years, because the aim was
to prevent the enemy from producing more munitions. However, during the
Gulf War of 1990, the infrastructure of Iraq was attacked, even though
the war was expected to be short. Electrical generating plants and water
purification facilities were deliberately destroyed with the apparent
aim of obtaining leverage over Iraq after the war.

In general, **[because war has such a catastrophic effect on
infrastructure]{.underline}**, it can be thought of as the opposite of
development. **[War is the greatest generator of poverty]{.underline}**.

**[Ecological damage]{.underline}**

[Warfare during the 20th century has not only caused the loss of 175
million lives]{.underline} (primarily civilians) -- **[it has also
caused the greatest ecological catastrophes in human
history]{.underline}**. The damage takes place even in times of peace.
Studies by Joni Seager, a geographer at the University of Vermont,
conclude that "**[a military presence anywhere in the world is the
single most reliable predictor of ecological damage]{.underline}**".

**[Modern warfare destroys environments to such a degree that it has
been described as an "environmental holocaust]{.underline}**." For
example, [herbicides use in the Vietnam War killed an estimated 6.2
billion board-feet of hardwood trees in the forests north and west of
Saigon,]{.underline} according to the American Association for the
Advancement of Science. Herbicides such as Agent Orange also made
enormous areas of previously fertile land unsuitable for agriculture for
many years to come. In Vietnam and elsewhere in the world, [valuable
agricultural land has also been lost because land mines or the remains
of cluster bombs make it too dangerous for farming]{.underline}.

**[During the Gulf War of 1990, the oil spills amounted to 150 million
barrels, 650 times the amount released into the environment by the
notorious Exxon Valdez disaster]{.underline}**. During the Gulf War [an
enormous number of shells made of depleted uranium were fired. When the
dust produced by exploded shells is inhaled it often produces cancer,
and it will remain in the environment of Iraq for decades]{.underline}.

**[Radioactive fallout from nuclear tests pollutes the global
environment and causes many thousands of cases of cancer, as well as
birth abnormalities]{.underline}**. **[Most nuclear tests have been
carried out on lands belonging to indigenous peoples.]{.underline}**
Agent Orange also produced cancer, birth abnormalities and other serious
forms of illness both in the Vietnamese population and among the foreign
soldiers fighting in Vietnam

## Refugees

### 1ac/2ac Refugees Scenario

#### Arms sales fuel wars that drive the global refugee crisis

**Hartung, 18** \-\-- director of the Arms and Security Project at the
Center for International Policy (4/20/18, William, "How War and Weapons
Trading Are Fueling the Global Refugee Crisis,"
<https://lobelog.com/how-war-and-weapons-trading-are-fueling-the-global-refugee-crisis/>,
accessed on 5/9/19, JMP)

Few would argue that the world faces a refugee crisis, but [not nearly
enough is being done to prevent the creation of new refugees or to help
those already displaced from their homes]{.underline}. And while
statistics can't fully capture the human suffering involved, it is
sobering to learn that the **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[N]{.underline}**ations [reports that over 20 million people have been
driven from their countries by war, famine, and poverty, with over 40
million more displaced within their own nations]{.underline}.

There is no science involved in figuring out which factors have the most
impact on creating the massive flow of refugees that characterize our
world, but one thing is clear--**[war is a major driver of this
humanitarian catastrophe]{.underline}**. According to the most recent
report by the United Nations refugee agency, [more than half of the
world's refugees come from three countries that have been the sites of
brutal, multi-year conflicts--Syria, Afghanistan, and South Sudan. War
is a direct cause of displacement]{.underline}, but it also increases
the risks of famine and disease, which also play a major role in driving
people from their home communities.

There is plenty of blame to go around for this dismal state of affairs,
from the role of Russia and Iran in propping up the murderous Assad
regime in Syria, to internal factions in South Sudan, to the Taliban and
the U.S.-backed government in Afghanistan. But this article will focus
on the role of the United States, not because it is the worst or only
culprit, but because there is--or should be--a better chance at changing
misguided policies in a democracy than there is in undemocratic regimes.

The United States Role In The Global Refugee Crisis

[The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [is
currently involved in eight wars--in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Niger,
Yemen, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Together, these conflicts have
generated millions of refugees, and displaced millions more within their
home countries.]{.underline} U.S. military intervention isn't
necessarily the primary cause of the refugee flow in all cases, but it
has generally made matters worse--in some cases much worse. [If
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[wants to make a constructive contribution to stemming worldwide refugee
flows, we need to rethink our all-war-all-the-time foreign
policy]{.underline}.

So far, Donald Trump hasn't started any new wars, but his administration
has doubled down on the wars he inherited, dropping more bombs,
launching more drone strikes, and causing more civilian casualties. We
can only hope that Trump and his new "war cabinet" of John Bolton and
Mike Pompeo (yet to be confirmed as Trump's Secretary of State) don't
get us involved in yet another conflict, in Iran, North Korea, or
elsewhere.

The recent U.S., French, and U.K. cruise missile strikes on Syria are a
case in point of what's wrong with the current foreign policies of the
United States and its allies. The Assad regime's chemical attacks on its
own population are horrific, but raining more bombs on Syria--however
accurate the strikes may or may not be--is no solution to the suffering
of the Syrian people. But there was a groundswell of support in the
media and some segments of the public to "do something" about Assad's
attack. And as Emma Ashford of the Cato Institute noted in an op-ed in
the New York Times, all too often "doing something" is defined narrowly
to mean taking military action. According to this militarized logic,
diplomacy--which is practically a dirty word in Trump World--doesn't
count. This is odd given the utter failure of the United States'
post-9/11 wars to achieve their stated objectives, but old, bad ideas
die hard.

If President Trump were truly concerned with the fate of the Syrian
people, there are a number of non-military steps that would do far more
to help them than lobbing yet more bombs and missiles at their country.
For starters, he could agree to admit significant numbers of Syrian
refugees into the United States, rather than blocking virtually all of
them--according to a recent report on NPR, the Trump administration has
let in a grand total of 11 Syrian refugees this year.

The United States could also increase its funding for U.N. humanitarian
efforts on behalf of refugees. There's plenty of money to be had if the
administration chose to spend even a little bit less on the Pentagon and
related agencies, which will receive \$700 billion this year, and more
on non-military tools of foreign policy.

The Role Of The Arms Trade In Fueling Conflict And Displacement

**[The global arms trade is on the rise, and the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[is by far the
dominant supplier]{.underline}**, as has been the case for 25 of the
last 26 years. And [the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[has supplied weapons to over 60 countries
involved in conflicts large and small]{.underline}**. Even more
impressive--if that's the right word for it--is the Cato Institute's
finding that [the U.S. has provided weaponry to 85% of the world's
nations during this century. **This is not a recipe for peace or
conflict reduction.**]{.underline}

The most egregious case of the use and abuse of U.S.-supplied arms is
the U.S.-backed, Saudi-led war in Yemen, which has killed thousands of
civilians through Saudi air strikes and put millions at risk of famine
and fatal disease due to a blockade that has limited the availability of
food, medicine, and clean water. Most of Yemen's displaced people are
still in the country, as the Saudi-led coalition has made it extremely
difficult for them to leave.

[An unintended consequence of U.S. arms sales that has also
**contributed greatly to the refugee crisis** is the leakage of
U.S.-supplied arms to non-state actors like ISIS and the Taliban, and
the wide dispersal of Libya arms caches throughout North Africa after
the overthrow of the Qaddafi regime.]{.underline}

What Is To Be Done?

Reducing conflict and its crushing human consequences will not be easy.
But the first step is putting more energy into resolving conflicts than
is currently being poured into fighting them with bombs and troops or
fueling them through weapons trafficking. As noted above, opening our
doors to many more refugees and generously funding humanitarian aid
efforts should be another pillar of a new approach.

Stopping wars will require beefing up diplomacy, not proposing deep cuts
in the State Department, denigrating career diplomats, and failing to
even appoint ambassadors to key nations. It will also require working
closely with allies and listening to the concerns of current and
potential adversaries, as was done in the negotiation of the landmark
deal to curb Iran's nuclear weapons capability. And finally, **[we need
a new arms transfer policy that curbs shipments to human rights abusers
and war zones--not through lip service, but through actual reductions in
sales]{.underline}**.

All of the above may seem like a pipe dream under the "America First"
approach of the current administration. But administrations change, as
does Congress, and if large numbers of people don't demand an end to our
policy of perpetual war and a resurgence of diplomacy, it will never
happen. It's time to get to work towards building a better world,
however long it may take to get there.

#### That triggers [intervention]{.underline} to stop migration and [forced returns]{.underline} which will escalate to [global war]{.underline}

**[[Migration Will Drive the Next Wave of World
Wars]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Today, not only does war continue to cause mass migration, but migration
can itself become a cause of war.

[[MASS MIGRATION]{.underline}]{.mark}, [on the]{.underline} sustained
and [massive scale that western Europe continues to experience, [creates
tensions]{.mark}]{.underline} not only within states but also between
them. These tensions will sometimes [[erupt into open
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}; already [[a new age of "Migration Wars"
has begun]{.underline}.]{.mark}

This represents a curious inversion. Across the centuries, war has been
a major, and often the main, driving force behind mass migration. Most
obviously, an indeterminable number of civilians was forced to flee the
fighting that raged in Europe and elsewhere during the Second World War,
while the ongoing civil war in Syria has created perhaps 5.3 million
refugees, in addition to many others who are "internally displaced."
Today, however, not only does war continue to cause mass migration, but
it can itself become a cause of war.

[This is]{.underline} the case [because of the sheer scale of the
current migrant]{.underline} crisis. The UNHCR estimates that [there
are]{.underline} around [65.6 million "forcibly displaced"
people]{.underline} in the world. Most of these are internally displaced
within their own countries, but around 22.5 million are refugees from
their native lands. Huge numbers of people have fled from countries ("of
departure"), notably Syria, to start new lives in the West, risking
their lives by undertaking often extremely hazardous journeys across the
Mediterranean or overland through countries ("of transit") such as
Turkey and Greece: in the first seven months of 2017 alone, 115,109
migrants succeeded in crossing the Mediterranean. And the total number
of asylum applications to western Europe jumped considerably in
2014--15, from 0.6 million to 1.4 million, falling slightly to 1.3
million in 2016, while many other migrants, unquantifiable in number,
have illicitly reached Western territory without formally requesting
asylum.

Parts of the world besides western Europe are also affected: since
August 2017, for example, around half a million Rohingya people have
fled violence and persecution in their native Myanmar for the relative
sanctuary of neighboring states, notably Bangladesh, Thailand, Indonesia
and Malaysia. Above all, [in sub-Saharan Africa millions are fleeing
poverty f]{.underline}rom the landlocked states of the Sahel and heading
for the relative prosperity of West Africa: around one fifth of Côte
d'Ivoire's population, for example, comprises people who were born
elsewhere.

The sheer vastness of this contemporary refugee crisis does not
represent any increase in the number of wars and conflicts, although it
is arguable that, because of the proliferation of small arms in recent
decades, this is one cause: in a speech in 2000, for example, UN
secretary-general Kofi Annan warned that the bloodshed created by small
arms and light weapons meant that "they could well be described as
'weapons of mass destruction.'" But more important is the proliferation
of economic migration, as increasing numbers flee poverty at home. The
causes of this may be varied---some blame overpopulation, or the
destructive impact of climate change upon food sources---but one driving
force is the heightened awareness that many refugees have. Because of
images broadcast on satellite television, mobile phones and the
internet, they are aware, in a way earlier generations were not, of the
relative material comfort the developed world can offer. This is
probably the reason why some relatively affluent African countries, such
as Senegal, also have high outflows of migrants.

Another difference lies in the proliferation of criminal gangs that, in
return for exploitative fees, organize and finance their journeys. Such
trafficking gangs are prevalent in two major hubs of migrant movement:
Thailand, which is a transit point for Rohingya refugees, and Libya.

Whatever the causes, this major movement of people has now acquired its
own momentum. Because so many refugees have reached the shores and
borders of, in particular, western Europe, and because so much media
attention has focused on this new phenomenon, an idea has taken hold in
the minds of many people who would never otherwise have contemplated
undertaking the hazardous crossing of the Mediterranean Sea or overland
journey through Central Asia or the Balkans: that it is possible to
start a new life in distant but affluent countries. This has been
accentuated by the decision of the German government, taken in 2015, to
open its borders to around one million refugees. In other words, many of
the millions who have fled to Europe in the past few years have climbed
on a bandwagon, following what they have seen others do rather than what
they have been forced, by adverse circumstance, to undertake. Despite
the determined efforts of Western governments to stop them, there is no
reason they will not continue trying to do so.

[SUCH [A vast migrant flow]{.mark}]{.underline}, or even its mere
threat, [[will tempt Western governments to
intervene]{.underline}]{.mark} in foreign lands---either countries of
departure or transit countries, such as Libya---in a bid [[to curb
those]{.underline} [flows]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} This, of
course, is nothing new. One country always has an interest and motive to
intervene in the affairs of another if it is being affected by a flow of
refugees from that country; this was true, to take one obvious example,
of Western involvement in the Balkan Wars of the early- to mid-1990s.
But the advent of sustained mass migration, from so many different
venues and across so many different routes and borders, is a new
phenomenon that is prompting changes of strategic direction in Western
capitals.

Such "[[migration interventionism" could]{.underline}]{.mark} of course
be entirely peaceful---such as the provision of foreign aid, for
example, to specific programs and initiatives that are designed to
reduce the level of migration. But it could also
[[take]{.underline}]{.mark} more ambitious, [[militaristic
forms]{.mark}, such as troop deployments to stabilize foreign
countries]{.underline}, or regions within them, that are experiencing,
or could potentially experience, a significant outflow of population.
[[This would]{.underline}]{.mark} not only reduce or eliminate any
incentive for putative migrants to leave, but also [[allow]{.mark} those
[foreign governments to deport and return]{.mark} existing
[migrants]{.mark} to a "safe country"]{.underline}: many international
and domestic laws (Article 16a of German Basic Law is an example)
prohibit the deportation of a refugee to a country that is not "safe."
However, the legal and practical difficulties of deporting migrants may
mean that "migration interventionism" will, in the years ahead, be
undertaken more as a preventive exercise---to prevent any possible
outflow---than a reactive one.

The emergence of migration interventionism became clear at the Munich
Security Conference in February 2017, when the UK defense secretary, Sir
Michael Fallon, justified the ongoing , if limited, British presence in
Afghanistan on the grounds that the collapse of the country would lead
to a massive refugee crisis. "We here will feel the consequences, very
directly," he claimed. "There could be three to four million young
Afghan men sent out by their villages to migrate westwards, and they are
heading here." This was a new justification for the allied presence in
Afghanistan, which had previously been rationalized on a number of other
grounds, varying from combating terrorists who presented a threat to the
West to preventing the flow of narcotics and establishing democracy and
human rights.

It is possible that any future [[Chinese military intervention in North
Kore]{.mark}a]{.underline}, in a bid to resolve the ongoing deadlock
surrounding Kim Jong-un's nuclear provocation,
[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[become]{.underline}]{.mark} a kind
of [[migration interventionism]{.underline}]{.mark}. Any conflict
between North Korea and the United States, or perhaps merely heightened
risk of such a conflict, would provoke a huge exodus of North Korean
refugees over the northern border, overwhelming Chinese resources.

Instead of committing their own troops overseas in order to prevent or
reduce migration into their territory, governments can also sponsor
foreign armies to act on their behalf. An example is the G5 Sahel Joint
Force, which the French government, supported by other Western
countries, began to establish in the Sahel in the course of 2017.
Comprising five thousand soldiers drawn from the armies of Burkina Faso,
Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Chad, the force is funded by the EU, whose
leaders regard it partly as an anti-insurgent force, but also as a means
of reducing the flow of migrants. "Our support will be an important
contribution to the efforts to counter terrorism in the Sahel region, as
well as irregular migration from West Africa to Europe," the Danish
minister for foreign affairs, Anders Samuelsen, has said . The force is
also sanctioned by UN Security Council Resolution 2359, which points to
the "serious challenges posed by . . . the smuggling of migrants \[and\]
trafficking in persons" from the Sahel. In the future, such a force
could also guard any Western nationals who are posted on foreign soil in
order to process asylum claims. (It was just such a proposal that the
French president, Emmanuel Macron, appeared to make in the summer of
2017 when he said France could establish processing "hotspots" in
Libya---which, since the overthrow of Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011, has
been a major departure point for millions of refugees.)

[Countries]{.underline} that are [seeking to stem the migrant
flow]{.underline} into their own territory [are]{.underline} also
increasingly [diverting their]{.underline} existing [military
resources]{.underline}, not just within departure states, but also
outside their borders. In the summer of 2015, for example, the EU began
EUNAVFOR MED, a naval operation in the Mediterranean Sea that was
intended to end human smuggling from Libya by seizing or destroying some
of the boats that the gangs were using. Under its mandate, this €12
million operation involved "boarding, searching, seizing and diverting"
smugglers' boats, and wherever possible, efforts to "dispose" of those
vessels. "This important transition," as an EU official argued , "will
enable the EU naval operation against human smugglers and traffickers in
the Mediterranean to conduct boarding, search, seizure and diversion on
the high seas of vessels suspected of being used for human smuggling or
trafficking, within international law." Vessels, drones and aircraft
drawn from at least ten member states formed part of what the EU's
foreign-policy chief, Federica Mogherini, called a "holistic" approach
to the migrant crisis.

[Such operations raise the prospect of]{.underline} confrontation and
[military clashes between recipient states and countries of departure
and transit.]{.underline} When the Italian government sent two patrol
ships close to the Libyan coast in August 2017, for example, Gen.
Khalifa Haftar, the ruler of a large swath of Libya, threatened to
attack them if they entered Libyan waters to search and destroy refugee
boats: "Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, Field Marshal Khalifa
Haftar, issues orders to the Libyan naval bases in Tobruk, Benghazi, Ras
Lanuf and Tripoli to confront any marine unit that enters the Libyan
waters without the permission of the army," a statement from the Libyan
National Army proclaimed. His warning reflected a growing popular anger
among Libyans against Italian interference in their domestic affairs.

Such clashes may be more likely if a foreign government threatens to
exploit or manipulate a refugee crisis in a bid to extort concessions
from other countries toward which those migrants are likely to head.
This appears to have been true of the Libyan government under the rule
of Qaddafi. Addressing a gathering in Rome in August 2010, Qaddafi had
claimed that unless he was given large sums of money, Europe would
experience the "advance of millions of immigrants" that would transform
it into "another Africa." He had added that "tomorrow Europe might no
longer be European and even black as there are millions who want to come
in," and alleged that "we don't know if Europe will remain an advanced
and united continent or if it will be destroyed, as happened with the
barbarian invasions." Demanding a payment of €5 billion to prevent this
from happening, his comments were condemned as "unacceptable blackmail"
by Italian parliamentarians. In the context of these remarks, it is
possible that the Anglo-French attack on Libya in 2011 was the first
migration war of the contemporary age: this may explain why, from the
onset of the crisis, in March 2011, the French president, Nicolas
Sarkozy, and the British leader, David Cameron, sought to oust Qaddafi
from power and ignored his offers of peace talks.

Turkey, which is the host of over three million refugees, has made
similar sallies at political blackmail in recent years against the
European Union: in March 2017, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan
threatened to tear up a key migrant deal with the EU, in apparent
retaliation for a ban placed by the German and Dutch governments on
political rallies by his followers living in those countries. Istanbul
had already struck a hard bargain when negotiating the deal, which came
into effect in March 2016, having demanded in return a \$3.3 billion aid
package and new negotiations on its membership in the European Union.
Should other states use similar tactics against more powerful ones in
the future, they may risk provoking armed attack.

BESIDES FOREIGN intervention in countries of departure, or armed clashes
with governments that seek to manipulate migration, the world will
witness other types of migration wars. In particular, foreign powers may
deliberately create, or exacerbate, a refugee crisis in another country
in order to divert the resources of the countries where those refugees
are likely to go. Of course, innocent civilians have always been
deliberately targeted in times of war: during World War Two, the Allied
bombing campaign was designed to undermine German civilians' morale and
shorten the war. However, deliberate attempts to drive civilians out of
a country, in a bid to weaken a third party, have historically been much
less common. Such a scenario is more likely to happen today for the
simple reason that a sustained mass migration of people is already under
way. This means that a government or militia has more opportunities to
manipulate the phenomenon, because it is easier to accentuate any such
movement than to create one; it is also less likely to risk
international condemnation by observers who cannot so easily blame
foreign intervention.

An example is the post-2011 Syrian refugee crisis. In March 2016,
several months after Russia had openly intervened in the conflict on the
side of President Bashar al-Assad, Gen. Philip Breedlove---the Supreme
Allied Commander Europe and head of U.S. European Command---claimed that
Vladimir Putin and Assad had "weaponized" migration through a campaign
of bombardment against civilian centers. Their agenda, he continued, was
to undermine NATO and western Europe: "Together, Russia and the Assad
regime are deliberately weaponizing migration in an attempt to overwhelm
European structures and break European resolve," General Breedlove told
the Senate Armed Services Committee. In particular, Russia's
indiscriminate use of weapons, such as barrel bombs, seemed to have "no
other purpose" other than to get civilians "on the road."

It is also likely that the Islamic State (ISIS) has deliberately created
or accentuated the flow of refugees from Iraq and Syria. Its shocking
acts of cruelty, such as the beheading of captives, and the careful
propagation of such images on the Internet, had a clear rationale: to
strike fear into the hearts of civilians and force them to flee. Its
advances during 2014--16 led to the displacement of three million in
Iraq, with far more internally displaced---more than 1.5 million in the
Kurdish region alone.

ISIS calculated that this would not only clear a path for its own foot
soldiers, but also overwhelm the resources of neighboring and perhaps
pro-Western regimes, such as Lebanon and Jordan, while adding to the
flow of refugees into western Europe. In the long term, this would
probably be seen as a way of "Islamizing" the West---increasing the
numerical presence of Muslims---but most obviously, in the short and
medium terms, it was a means of infiltrating Europe with sympathizers:
there have been numerous attacks across Europe, including Paris, Nice,
Manchester, London and Berlin, by ISIS-linked insurgents. And in
December 2016, Europol published a report that pointed out another
danger: "A real and imminent danger is the possibility of elements of
the \[Sunni Muslim\] Syrian refugee diaspora becoming vulnerable to
radicalization once in Europe and being specifically targeted by Islamic
extremist recruiters," argued the authors of "Changes in Modus Operandi
of Islamic State Revisited."

However, it is also possible that Islamic State had another motive.
Instead of deliberately creating a flow of refugees in order to carry
out attacks or overwhelm its enemies' resources, it may have been trying
to provoke them to undertake a "migration intervention." Its motive for
doing this would have been either to spark a confrontation with other
regional actors or to tie down foreign troops in a protracted insurgency
and steadily drain its resources. For example, if NATO had undertaken a
large-scale deployment into parts of Syria to fight ISIS, then its
presence would have sparked a conflict not just with President Assad but
also with his chief supporter, Russia. Alternatively, NATO troops would
have faced sustained casualties from a protracted insurgency, comparable
to the conflict that they (and the Russians) fought in Afghanistan as
well as the experiences of the United States in Vietnam in the 1960s,
and Israel in Lebanon in the 1990s.

THE ADVENT of [[sustained mass migration could]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[trigger conflict if a country tried to **forcibly
return**]{.underline}]{.mark} or expel some or all of [[its new
arrivals.]{.underline}]{.mark} This scenario is, of course, also a
recipe for civil unrest. The migrants themselves may resist: such
violence broke out at Calais in northern France in the fall of 2016, for
example, when the French riot police forcibly removed thousands of
refugees from a camp known as "The Jungle." However, [violence could
also break out between neighboring states, for instance if one tried to
drive refugees away from its own territory onto the soil of the other;
or if it closed its own border to stop a column of refugees crossing its
own borders]{.underline}, thereby forcing them to move into, or remain
within, another country.

[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} scenario [[is already
causing]{.underline}]{.mark} political [[conflict within the
EU]{.underline}]{.mark}, as the Polish and Hungarian governments
continue to resist demands for a quota of refugees that other member
states, notably Italy, Germany and France, are already hosting. However,
[[it could]{.underline}]{.mark} in some circumstances [[spark military
confrontation]{.underline}]{.mark}---for example, [[between countries
that]{.mark} already [have]{.mark} unstable and [tense
relations]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [or]{.underline} even [when
countries of destination are severely overstretched by the strains of
coping with a large influx of people. This nearly happened in Southeast
Asia]{.underline} in the late 1980s, when a huge exodus of civilians
from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia threatened to overwhelm neighboring
countries---Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and
Indonesia---which, in return, used naval and police boats and
helicopters to push back refugees away from their coasts. The prime
minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, admitted, "All we are doing is
preventing foreign vessels from entering our waters."

Another variety of migration wars will break out when migrants from one
country will be pursued and persecuted by militias---or perhaps by
government forces---based in their countries of origin. This may be
because, for example, those soldiers seek to take revenge, or to destroy
a political cause that the refugees are seen to represent. Such
cross-border attacks would then trigger conflict with the host country
in which those migrants have taken refuge. Such a scenario took place in
Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) in the mid-1990s, as
Rwandan troops crossed the border, killing thousands of Hutu refugees
who had fled there. This provoked resistance from the Zairean army,
whose leader was broadly sympathetic to the Hutu cause. More recently,
in September 2017, there were also reports that Myanmar helicopters had
crossed into Bangladeshi airspace in hot pursuit of Rohingya refugees.

But because of the vociferous international condemnation it inevitably
provokes, this type of conflict is only likely to occur in relatively
obscure parts of the world, and at moments when events elsewhere
distract international attention. Otherwise, a more likely outcome is an
intelligence-led war against elements within a refugee population,
comparable to Soviet spies assassinating émigrés during the Cold War.

Tension might also arise if one country demands the repatriation of any
number of its civilians who have fled for the sanctuary of another. Such
tensions are nothing new, and have previously arisen not only between
countries of origin and destination but, on occasion, with third parties
too. After the 1848 revolutions in Europe, for example, the fate of
Hungarian and Polish exiles, whom the Russian government wanted to
extradite from Turkey, became a cause célèbre in Britain. However, such
international tensions are likely to become more frequent in the years
ahead and may conceivably erupt into confrontation. The most obvious
single example was the American invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, after
the Taliban regime refused to hand over its "guest," Osama bin Laden.

There may also be occasional circumstances in which mass migration will
prompt states not to fight against each other, but to join forces and
wage a collective war against innocent refugees. During the Rohingya
migrant crisis of August and September 2017, for example, Sheikh
Hasina's secular Awami League government in Bangladesh proposed joint
military operations with Myanmar against Rohingya insurgents. But such a
campaign---where innocents are extremely difficult to distinguish from
militants---could easily spiral into a wider war against all Rohingya
refugees.

Finally, the phenomenon of mass migration may spark armed clashes
between states and activists that act---or claim to act---either on
behalf of migrants or, in some cases, to defend their own homeland from
migrants. In the summer of 2017, for example, a far-right German group,
"Defend Europe," sent a vessel into the Mediterranean to confront
refugee boats and send them "back to Africa." Such clashes, which could
also erupt between activists, are of course not likely to be sustained
or large-scale, but could be brief and bloody. The violence at Calais in
2016 was orchestrated by activists who confronted the police, while in
August 2017 the Libyan authorities expressly warned ngos that had been
helping some refugee boats in crossing the Mediterranean to steer clear
of its territorial waters. The low-level clashes that could erupt
between states and activists are exemplified by the tension between the
French government and Greenpeace in the 1970s and 1980s over the issue
of nuclear testing in the South Pacific. French warships harassed
Greenpeace vessels, and on occasion used violence: French commandos
stormed aboard Vega in 1973, for example, to seize its equipment and, in
a notorious case in July 1985, used explosives to sink the Rainbow
Warrior .

However, such [[low-level clashes could]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[spark a more serious]{.underline}]{.mark} type of
[[confrontation]{.underline} i]{.mark}f, in the process, one government
is deemed responsible for injuring or killing foreign nationals. This
would certainly create very serious political tension, just as the
Rainbow Warrior incident provoked a loud chorus of excoriation from
across the world, particularly from the two governments that represented
the Dutch-Portuguese activist who was killed in the bombing. Another
example was the tension between Tel Aviv and Ankara that followed
Israel's attack on the "Gaza Peace Flotilla" in May 2010, which led to
the deaths of ten activists. However, it could in some circumstances
also trigger war, just as in August 1998, the death of eleven Iranian
diplomats in Afghanistan came perilously close to sparking a full-scale
conflict between Iran and the Taliban.

The new migration phenomenon, in other words, is not just a humanitarian
tragedy, but [[it]{.mark} also [threatens to destabilize **whole
regions** of the world]{.mark}]{.underline} in far-reaching ways. This
means that it is imperative for every country---in the developing as
well as the developed world---not just to manage the flow of people, but
to tackle the causes of the migration problem at their source. More
attention must focus on the phenomenon's root causes, whether it is
attributed to war, corruption or population growth. The ongoing
situation in Myanmar, where discrimination against Rohingya remains
institutionalized, also illustrates the dangers of injustice. More
radical, drastic solutions will need to be considered. The consequences
of inaction will be profound for all; the new age of migration wars has
already begun.

#### This is an existential risk that causes great power wars

**Krasner, 18** -- Stephen David Krasner is an international relations
professor at Stanford University and is a former Director of Policy
Planning at the United States Department of State (Daedalus, Winter,
"Conclusion", <https://www.amacad.org/publication/conclusion>

Migration, regional instability, and great-power conflict. Civil wars
are also dangerous because they could lead to greater refugee flows,
regional destabilization, and great-power conflict. Not every civil war
has the potential for generating these global crises, but if generated,
they would be a product not just of civil strife but also of policy
choices that were made by advanced industrialized countries. In this
regard, they should be contrasted with possible pandemics and
transnational terrorism that, arguably, would occur regardless of the
policies adopted by wealthy democratic states.

As Sarah Lischer's essay shows, the number of migrants -- especially
people displaced by civil wars -- has increased dramatically in recent
years.4 Most of these migrants have been generated by three conflicts,
those in Afghanistan, Syria, and Somalia. [The wave of migrants entering
Western Europe has destabilized traditional politics]{.underline} and
contributed to the success of Brexit in the UK, the increased share of
votes secured by right-wing parties in a number of Western European
countries, and the electoral gains of a number of right-wing parties in
Eastern Europe. Anxiety about immigration contributed to Donald Trump's
victory in the United States. European countries, even those on the left
like Sweden, have responded to rising numbers of refugees by tightening
the rules for potential migrants. The European Union reached a deal with
Turkey in 2016 to provide financial resources in exchange -- among other
things -- for an increase in acceptance of refugees. At the same time,
[[the sheer number of refugees in Jordan and Lebanon
can]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially [[undermine government
control]{.underline}]{.mark} in those countries.

[The impact of [civil wars in one country can spread]{.mark} to
surrounding areas]{.underline}. ISIL's ambitious campaigns have
afflicted Syria and Iraq. Civil strife in Somalia has, as Seyoum Mesfin
and Abdeta Beyene write, influenced the policies of Ethiopia.5 The FARC
insurgency in Colombia impacted Venezuela and Ecuador. [[Conflict in
the]{.underline}]{.mark} Democratic Republic of the Congo ([[DRC) drew
in several neighboring states. Some regional conflicts have resulted in
**millions of deaths**,]{.underline}]{.mark} most notably the war in the
DRC, with limited impact on and attention from wealthy industrialized
countries. [[Wars in the Middle East]{.underline}]{.mark}, however,
[have been more consequential because they have [led to the involvement
of Russia and the]{.mark}]{.underline} [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, they are closer to Europe and have
therefore generated more refugees, and Middle Eastern oil is a global
commodity on which much of the world depends. Regional destabilization
in the Middle East does matter for the West; regional destabilization in
Central Africa may only matter for those who live in the neighborhood.

Direct confrontation between major powers has not occurred since the end
of World War II. [[In well-governed areas]{.underline}]{.mark}, where
civil wars are absent, [[the likelihood of great-power conflict is
small]{.underline}]{.mark}. Territorial conquest has been delegitimized
(though Russia's annexation of Crimea stands as a recent exception to
this norm). The existence of [[nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[[removed uncertainty about the costs]{.underline}]{.mark} of a
confrontation between nuclear-armed states with assured second-strike
capability. [[Great-power confrontations are]{.underline}]{.mark},
however, **[[more likely]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[in areas that are
afflicted by civil strife, because instability]{.mark} and appeals from
local actors [could draw in major state actors]{.mark} with vested
interests]{.underline}. This is especially true for the Middle East.
Moreover, in countries on the periphery of Russia that were formerly
part of the Soviet Union, especially those with sizeable Russian ethnic
populations, the government in Moscow has demonstrated that it can
increase the level of internal unrest. There is no guarantee of
stability, even in countries that might have been stable absent external
support for dissident groups that would otherwise have remained
quiescent.

As Barry Posen suggests in his essay, [[multipolarity makes]{.mark} all
aspects of [external involvement]{.mark} in civil wars [more fraught,
including the possibility of a]{.mark} **conflict among the major
powers**]{.underline}.6 In a multipolar world, [no single pole is likely
to be able to dictate outcomes to potential combatants.]{.underline}
[The possibility of]{.underline} a hurting [stalemate declines because
all sides hope that their fortunes could be resurrected by some outside
power]{.underline}. Absent a hurting stalemate, which makes the standard
treatment including UN Peacekeeping Operations (UN PKOs) and other forms
of assistance attractive to major combatants, civil wars are more likely
to continue. The contemporary international environment is more
multipolar than was the case during the bipolarity of the Cold War or
the unipolarity of the United States that lasted for a little over a
decade after the Soviet Union collapsed. Managing civil wars will now be
more difficult. [The possibility of [great-power conflict]{.mark} has
increased]{.underline}. And because wars will prove harder to end,
refugee flows will persist.

### IL -- Refugees

#### Instability magnifies refugee crises -- Turkey proves

**Lischer 17** (Sarah Kenyon; associate professor in the department of
Politics and International Affairs at Wake Forest University. She is the
author of Dangerous Sanctuaries: Refugee Camps, Civil War, and the
Dilemmas of Humanitarian Aid (Cornell University Press, 2005); Dædalus
Vol 146 No. 4 pg. 85-95; MIT Press //GBS Rudolph)

Unsurprisingly, [refugee crises tend to occur in unstable and
high-conflict regions, which begets further violence and
displacement]{.underline}. Trying to resolve a crisis in isolation of
the **[regional security environment generally leads to frustration and
a waste of resources.]{.underline}** For example, the return of hundreds
of thousands of Iraqi refugees who had been in Syria does not indicate
improvement in the Iraq conflict; it merely demonstrates the decreasing
options available to the Iraqis who, for the most part, remain displaced
within Iraq. [Rather than solving a problem, refugee return merely
relocated it.]{.underline}

The [dangerous security environment has clearly affected the Turkish
government's response to Syrian refugees and has created a precarious
situation for them on the border]{.underline}. Turkey does not grant
Syrians refugee status or allow them to register with the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (unhcr); rather they are granted
"temporary protection." In 2013, Turkey adopted the Law on Foreigners
and International Protection to establish an immigration process for
Syrians. **[The law recognizes Syrians as "guests" rather than as
refugees and uses the term "guest camps" rather than refugee
camps]{.underline}**.

The mixed Turkish government response to Syrians stems, in part, from
conflicts and tensions with its own Kurdish population. As President
Erdoğan stated, "What happens in Syria \[is\] an internal affair of
Turkey and not a foreign policy issue."19 A Kurdish homeland is anathema
to Turkey, yet the displacement patterns of Kurds are increasing the
geographical clustering among Kurds in Iraq, Syria, and Turkey. Foreign
policy scholars Elizabeth Ferris and Kemal Kirişci have explained that
"[the Turkish government considers the prospect of an uninterrupted
Kurdish-controlled zone along its border a threat to national security."
They continue, "this complicates Turkey's relationship with the United
States, which maintains very close cooperation with the \[Syrian Kurdish
rebel group\] pyd in the fight against isis."]{.underline}20 In
addition, Syria's [Kurds have been effective in countering isis; thus,
military action to weaken them creates tension between Turkey and the
United States. The main losers in the high politics and negotiations
have been the refugees, who see a continual decline in their
humanitarian and legal protection.]{.underline}

Regional violence also surrounds the issue of displacement in Kenya, a
host state in a supremely bad neighborhood. The surrounding states
include Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Uganda--countries
that have variously suffered civil war, international war, famine,
terrorist attacks, and crushing poverty. Cross-border refugee flows and
rebel attacks coexist in this unstable region.

The Kenyan government views its Somali refugee population as intertwined
with the larger security issue of cross-border attacks by Al Shabaab.
Kenya cited the need to relocate refugees to support its 2011 invasion
of Somalia and the establishment of a buffer zone on the Somali side of
the border. Abdeta Beyene and Seyoum Mesfin highlight the regional
security strategy of buffer zones, "which can be established in a shared
territory or created unilaterally through force and monitored
exclusively by one state or through proxies in a nonshared area in (a)
relatively weaker state(s), or on the other side of the enemy's
territory that harbors a threat to the stronger state."21 The Kenyan
government continues to battle Al Shabaab and intermittently revives the
threat to close the refugee camps.

[Regional security issues remain important during conflict resolution
and peace-building,]{.underline} as well. [The way in which displaced
populations are integrated into a peace plan, and whether they are
offered a durable solution to their situation, can influence
postconflict stability]{.underline}. **[Refugees from the most
protracted conflicts, such as in Afghanistan, include people who were
born into refugee status and have never seen their
"homeland]{.underline}**." The concept of voluntary return often does
not appeal to the generations who grew up in Pakistan and live in
established communities there. [This creates tensions between the host
state, which urges the refugees to return, and the refugees who resist
repatriation.]{.underline} Reporting from Pakistan, Human Rights Watch
claimed that "in the second half of 2016, a toxic combination of
deportation threats and police abuses pushed out nearly 365,000 of the
country's 1.5 million registered Afghan refugees, as well as just over
200,000 of the country's estimated 1 million undocumented Afghans."22
The government of Afghanistan, which cannot meet the needs of its
existing inhabitants, finds itself overwhelmed by returning refugees. A
November 2016 report describes instances of "returning refugees clashing
with locals over resources and land," and explains that "[the displaced
are often rejected, or pushed into squalid camps. They also face the
threat of forced eviction and rarely have access to clean water or
food]{.underline}."23 The internal displacement crisis in Afghanistan
demonstrates the need to develop a feasible survival plan for the
returnees. Otherwise, conflict can erupt and displacement will continue
to grow.

[The negative effect of bad neighborhoods indicates that peacemakers
must take a coordinated regional approach to conflict
resolution]{.underline}. In conflict clusters, such as Central Africa,
the attempt to resolve one crisis usually results in the relocation of
violence rather than resolution. As Congolese rebels (and refugees) were
pushed from Uganda, for example, they merely resurfaced in other weak,
conflict-ridden states in the region. [The destabilizing effect of
refugee repatriation in Afghanistan offers another example of
traditional peace-building measures that can actually worsen a
situation. In the short term, policy-makers may find it easier to focus
on piecemeal solutions to displacement crises, but such measures can
actually undermine long-term peace efforts.]{.underline}

#### Refugee crises exacerbate regional stability -- their suffering is downplayed

Politics and International Affairs at Wake Forest University. She is the

Protection; Dædalus Vol 146 No. 4 pg. 85-95; MIT Press //GBS Rudolph)
**IDP=internally displaced people**

[Millions of people around the world today have fled their homes to
escape civil war and other violence]{.underline}. Recent United Nations
figures report 22.5 million refugees and 38 million internally displaced
persons (idps). Statistics from 1996 to 2016 show that refugee numbers
are at a twenty-year high. [Internal displacement, in which people are
forced from their homes but cannot cross the border, is also at a
twenty-year high]{.underline}. Remarkably, 55 percent of the world's
refugees come from three states experiencing protracted civil wars:
Syria (5.5 million), Somalia (1.4 million), and Afghanistan (2.5
million).1 [Contrary to their expectations of sanctuary, many of these
people continue to experience security threats in their new
locations]{.underline}. **[Manipulation of refugee groups for political
and strategic purposes generally reduces their safety and downplays the
human suffering associated with the crisis]{.underline}**. In addition
to being a [tragic output of civil war, massive and intractable refugee
crises often become deeply enmeshed in the politics, security, and
economics of the conflict]{.underline}.

Early responses to refugee flows usually address functional and
practical issues, actions such as meeting basic needs and working out
the logistics of displacement, [but these **rarely require direct
attention from national political leaders**. As the crisis grows
geographically and numerically, national leaders are confronted by the
broader implications of refugee populations, though government discourse
focuses more on the humanitarian disaster, rather than the conflict
itself, increasing the likelihood of **scapegoating** and
**manipulation**]{.underline}. [Temporary situations begin to seem more
permanent, increasing displacement-related tensions within and between
affected states]{.underline}. [A major concern of international
negotiation then revolves around dealing with the "excess" people
produced by the conflict, sometimes even eclipsing the focus on conflict
resolution.]{.underline}

[**Many host states express concern about the destabilizing effects of
sizeable refugee populations**. Large-scale forced displacement places
an immense strain on the resources of the host states, the refugees, and
international donors]{.underline}. Some governing parties fear a loss of
power due to popular anger over economic hardship and social pressures
sparked by large refugee populations. **[Refugee crises may exacerbate
existing political, ethnic, or religious tensions within the host state
or between the host and sending states]{.underline}**. [Refugee
demographics can create an unstable ethnic balance that encourages a
previously oppressed minority to confront the government]{.underline}.
Host states struggling to meet the needs of both displaced people and
their own citizens resent the lack of assistance from wealthier, more
distant states. [In the worst-case scenario, destabilization of the host
state and threats to refugee protection can **exacerbate civil and
international conflict.**]{.underline}

In Lebanon, a country already coping with political and economic
difficulties, Syrian refugees now account for more than 20 percent of
the population. Local Lebanese citizens blame the influx of refugees for
increasing food and housing prices and for undermining wages.2 The
mostly Sunni Arab newcomers affect the delicate sectarian balance, which
also includes Christians and Shia Muslims. The antigovernment Shia
group, Hezbollah, actually offers significant military assistance to the
Assad government in Syria. The International Crisis Group explained that
"the specter of renewed conflict has led the Lebanese authorities to
adopt a heavy-handed security approach toward the refugees" that has
included raids on refugee encampments and arrests of refugee men.3
Governments such as Lebanon's that bear the brunt of regional crises
therefore express resentment when the United States and other wealthy
countries refuse to accept even a miniscule proportion of the displaced
people. [Regional governments have increasingly used refugees as
leverage in negotiations with Western states desperate to prevent the
mass arrival of asylum seekers]{.underline}. **[Humanitarian
organizations, refugees, and sympathetic governments condemn the
manipulation of displaced populations for political
reasons]{.underline}**. [Advocates are particularly critical of
measures, such as forced return to conflict zones, that contravene the
international legal principles of refugee protection]{.underline}. In
some situations, **[overwhelmed or hostile host states reduce legal
protection and humanitarian aid, which can lead to violence and renewed
displacement.]{.underline}** [Destabilization and human rights abuses in
the first country of asylum can spur secondary displacement, as we have
seen in the mass movement of refugees from the Middle East to
Europe.]{.underline}

[The most extreme outcome is the spread of violence across borders,
which occurs if the original conflict spreads from the refugee-sending
state via cross-border attacks, rebel activity, or
invasion]{.underline}. Militants may mix among the refugees, as occurred
when the militarized Rwandan Hutu state inexile fled to Zaire among
millions of refugees following the 1994 genocide. Refugee related
violence remains rare, however, and observers caution against treating
all refugees "**[as potential threats to be controlled, rather than as
displaced victims of conflict in need of asylum."]{.underline}**4
Indeed, drawing on Stephen Stedman and Bruce Jones's argument, which
downplays the current rhetoric about global chaos, [one could argue that
attention to the global refugee crisis has more to do with its influence
on Europe and the Middle East than a qualitative change in the nature of
displacement. Stedman and Jones have labeled as "preposterous" the idea
that refugees from the Middle East fundamentally threaten European
security.]{.underline}

**[In addition to displacement across international borders, most
conflicts include large numbers of idps. In conflicts such as Syria,
Iraq, and Colombia, there are more people displaced within the borders
than outside them]{.underline}**. As of 2015, 6.7 million Colombians
were displaced within the country due to the decades-long conflict
there, whereas 360,000 Colombians were registered as refugees in
neighboring countries.6 Both refugees and idps suffer from similar
humanitarian needs, and both generally lack security. In terms of
international law and security, the situation differs for these
populations since IDPs are supposed to be protected by their own
government. **[Concerns with sovereignty complicate efforts to protect
and assist the internally displaced, particularly when the government is
a main driver of displacement]{.underline}**. [A major concern in
conflict resolution is that returning refugees end up internally
displaced, creating an impediment to peace-building and stability.
Unlike refugee populations, idps present less risk to regional stability
or the international spread of civil war.]{.underline}

[The violence directed at refugees and idps generally far outweighs
criminal or militant activity emanating from the
population]{.underline}. For example, Palestinian refugees within Syria
have faced mounting difficulties now that they are also internally
displaced. The Brookings Institution reported that, in 2011, the Yarmouk
camp near Damascus held 150,000 to 200,000 Palestinians, as well as
650,000 Syrians. Later, in 2012, "intense fighting broke out in the camp
between pro-regime and opposition forces, with the Free Syrian Army and
the Al Nusra Front taking control of the camp by the end of the year."7
Most of the Syrians left the camp. The Syrian government imposed a siege
on the camp in mid-2013. After the siege was "relaxed" in early 2014, it
then suffered attack by isis in April 2015. As of fall 2015, five to
eight thousand people remained in Yarmouk.8 The Palestinian refugees in
Syria thus suffered the effects of multiple types of displacement.

Large-scale forced migration initially affects the specific hosting
states and refugee groups, however, those trends can also have a much
broader reach. [Considering the potential for exacerbating conflict or
undermining peace efforts, this essay explores the following questions:
Under what circumstances does a refugee crisis contribute to
destabilization in the host state? What conditions are most likely to
promote violations of humanitarian and legal protection for the
displaced? In what ways do host-state destabilization and refugee
insecurity interact with the wider dynamics of a civil war? Answering
these questions requires an examination of the historical context in the
host state, the regional security environment, the response by Western
states, and the human geography of the crisis.]{.underline}

Political scientist Myron Weiner's classic article on refugees and
conflict, "Bad Neighbors, Bad Neighborhoods," **[explains how regional
conflict contributes to the likelihood of refugee-related
violence]{.underline}**.17 Certainly, both the Horn of Africa and the
Middle East qualify as "bad neighborhoods" in which conflicts tend to
cluster[. In assessing the likelihood of further conflict, one can ask
how many neighboring states experience violent conflict and whether
there is cross-border violence or rebel group activity. Those questions
highlight the role of weak or fractured governments, particularly those
that lack control of their periphery, in exacerbating potential
destabilization. The relationship between the host and the sending state
will also **determine the level of tension and risk of violence based on
the refugee crisis.**]{.underline}

## Nigeria

### IL -- Arms Sales =\> Human Rights Abuses / Don't Solve Relations

#### Super Tucano aircraft sales destroy the Nigerian governments finance, greenlight HR abuses and don't solve military relations

**Page 16** -- formerly the State Department's top expert on Nigeria,
worked on Nigeria at the Department of Defense and for the U.S. Marine
Corps  ( Matthew \"Five Reasons Washington Should Rethink Selling
Warplanes to Nigeria,\" War on the Rocks,
<https://warontherocks.com/2016/11/five-reasons-washington-should-rethink-selling-warplanes-to-nigeria/>
11-8-2016)

[The Department of Defense will soon notify Congress [it plans to
sell](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-nigeria-arms-idUSKCN0XX09M) 12
A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft to Nigeria]{.underline}. Both
countries hope that the propeller-driven warplanes --- [tailored for
counterinsurgency
operations](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/low-and-slow) --- will
bolster Nigerian efforts to combat Boko Haram, one of the world's
deadliest terrorist groups.

U.S. policymakers also want the sale to be a visible symbol of their
strong desire to do more to help Nigeria combat terrorism.
Unfortunately, [the sale will be a Pyrrhic victory for five reasons: It
is way too expensive, it undermines U.S. corruption policy, it overlooks
recent human rights abuses, it won't help Nigeria fight the Boko Haram
of tomorrow, and it won't foster closer defense
cooperation.]{.underline}

[Nigeria can't afford it.]{.underline}

For Nigeria, [the cost of the planes is staggering]{.underline}, given
that [its economy is in deep recession and its currency,
the naira, [lost 50 percent of its value against the
dollar](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-06/free-float-flounders-as-nigeria-s-naira-hits-black-market-record) over
the last year]{.underline}. Based on [similar deal with
Lebanon](http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/defense/2015-09-08/lebanon-may-get-armed-super-tucanos-despite-instability),
[the sale]{.underline} --- which probably includes munitions, spare
parts, and a maintenance package --- [may total over \$500
million:]{.underline} [roughly half of Nigeria's [2016 defense
budget](http://www.budgetoffice.gov.ng/pdfs/2016pro/DEFENCE.pdf) and
over twice as much as the Nigerian Army's entire annual salary
bill.]{.underline}

U.S. policymakers should recognize that the government of President
Muhammadu [Buhari]{.underline} ---even if it wants to buy the planes ---
[has many other more pressing humanitarian and socioeconomic
need]{.underline}s. In northeast Nigeria, for example, [[over two
million internally displaced
people](http://www.voanews.com/a/humanitarian-crisis-grips-northeast-nigeria-united-nations-agency-says/3472418.html) are
threatened by famine and disease.]{.underline} Acknowledging the
country's fiscal constraints, Nigeria's Senate President, in August
2016, [called for more international financial and logistical
help](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/23/nigeria-gathering-humanitarian-crisis-food-insecurity-boko-haram-bukola-saraki) to
address crisis and to reconstruct the region so it is no longer the
"perfect breeding ground for Boko Haram." [In lieu of costly warplanes,
Nigeria would be wise to invest half of a billion dollars in its
marginalized northeast to address long-term drivers of conflict like
chronic underdevelopment, poverty, and food insecurity.]{.underline}

Beyond the northeast, [Nigeria could use \$500 million to help remedy a
litany of other problems. It could begin resuscitating its failing
universities, fixing its dilapidated public hospitals, or constructing
solar-powered mini-grids in thousands of rural communities.]{.underline}
Nigeria --- a country of over 170 million people that [generates as much
power as the city of
Edinburgh](http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21693971-nigeria-has-about-much-electricity-edinburgh-problem-powerless) ---
desperately needs dozens of new power plants.

It sends mixed messages on corruption.

Sticker shock aside, [the sale undermines statements by [President
Barack
Obama](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/07/20/remarks-president-obama-and-president-buhari-nigeria-bilateral-meeting), [Secretary

and [Treasury Secretary Jacob
Lew](https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl0125.aspx) that
helping Nigeria fight corruption is a top U.S. policy
priority.]{.underline} The U.S. effort to sell weapons to the Nigerian
Air Force --- whose last three chiefs, along with several other of its
top officers, [are currently on
trial](http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/05/efcc-to-arraign-ex-chief-of-air-staff-md-umar-wednesday/) for
embezzlement and procurement fraud --- is incongruous with U.S.
rhetoric. Nigerian Air Force corruption is not ancient history: [The
senior air force officer who the U.S. Defense Attaché brought to
Washington in July 2015 to discuss the Super Tucano sale [has since been
charged with
corruption](https://efccnigeria.org/efcc/index.php/news/1999-efcc-docks-avm-ojuawo-for-n40m-bribe)]{.underline}.
Furthermore, it is not clear that the Nigerian Air Force become any more
transparent about its finances, procurement, or contracting processes
over the last year.

**[Washington's other partner in the deal --- Brazilian aircraft
manufacturer Embraer --- just last month [agreed to pay \$205 million in
fines](http://www.fcpablog.com/blog/2016/10/24/embraer-pays-205-million-to-settle-fcpa-charges.html) to
resolve criminal violations of the [Foreign Corrupt Practices

admitted](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/embraer-agrees-pay-more-107-million-resolve-foreign-corrupt-practices-act-charges) that
it bribed officials to sell Super Tucanos to the Dominican Republic and
other aircraft to Saudi Arabia, Mozambique, and India. [Brazilian
authorities, meanwhile, [have charged several former top
executives](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-embraer-corruption-idUSKCN0WJ20Z) at
Embraer with corruption and money laundering in connection with the sale
of Super Tucanos to the Dominican Republic.]{.underline}

**[It overlooks Nigerian military human rights abuses.]{.underline}**

U.S. policymakers have repeatedly voiced their concerns about the
Nigerian military's human rights record. In September 2013, a [State
Department spokesperson
said](http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2013/10/215414.htm#NIGERIA)[:  "We
continue to emphasize...that abuses by the \[Nigerian\] security forces
undermine our security goals," noting that President Obama had discussed
the issue with then-President Goodluck Jonathan.]{.underline}

In May 2014, Undersecretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy,
and Human Rights [Sarah Sewall told
Congress](https://www.c-span.org/video/?319459-1/threat-boko-haram) that
"[some fifty percent of the Nigerian military, at this point in time,
are not eligible" for training and materiel support because of
the [Leahy
Amendment](http://www.humanrights.gov/dyn/an-overview-of-the-leahy-vetting-process.html)]{.underline}.
In 2015, [the United States declared Nigeria in violation of the [Child
Soldiers Prevention
Act](http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/135981.pdf), citing
the [use of underage boys by a government-sponsored
militia](http://watchlist.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2111-Watchlist-Nigeria_LR.pdf)]{.underline}.

Even though the Nigerian air force has a better human rights record than
the army, [policymakers have long debated whether the Nigerian Air Force
is doing enough to minimize civilian deaths.]{.underline} As recently as
May 2016, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Linda
Thomas-Greenfield specifically mentioned U.S. concerns over Nigeria's
use of airpower [in her testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee](https://www.c-span.org/video/?409337-1/federal-officials-testify-terrorism-subsaharan-africa):

Last year you will know that [we turned them \[the Nigerian government\]
down for Cobras \[attack helicopters\] because we were concerned about
their ability to use those and not have them have an impact on their
communities...]{.underline}

[The [decision to block the
sale](http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/169264-why-nigerian-military-has-difficulty-getting-arms-from-america-u-s-govt.html) angered
Nigerians and some U.S. officials, but it took place only a few months
after Nigerian warplanes [bombed and
strafed](http://www.latimes.com/world/africa/la-fg-nigeria-military-abuses-20150603-story.html)
residential areas during a joint operation that [killed several hundred
military
detainees](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-26819965) that escaped
in a March 2014 jailbreak.]{.underline}

Yet, [the Super Tucano sale suggests that Washington's concerns about
Nigerian military abuses have waned over the last year]{.underline},
despite the Buhari government's own mixed record. In December 2015,
soldiers reportedly perpetrated gross human rights violations during in
two separate military crackdowns
in [Zaria](http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/195620-zaria-massacre-human-rights-watch-says-over-300-killed-buried-by-soldiers.html)and [[Onitsha](http://www.premiumtimesng.com/investigationspecial-reports/204902-special-report-inside-massive-extrajudicial-killings-nigerias-south-east.html).
The Buhari government also has not prosecuted anyone involved in
the [grisly deaths, between 2011 and 2014, of thousands of
detainees](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr44/1657/2015/en/) from
starvation, torture, and disease at the Giwa Barracks military
priso]{.underline}n. Such deaths continue to occur at there, albeit at a
slower pace, [according to human rights
groups](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-36259126). Just last
month, **[the United Nations Children's Fund revealed that the military
was [detaining hundreds of children at Giwa
Barracks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/un-has-negotiated-release-of-876-children-detained-by-nigerian-military-this-year/2016/10/28/50a07e90-9d43-11e6-9980-50913d68eacb_story.html).]{.underline}**

Boko Haram isn't especially vulnerable to airpower.

[The Super Tucano]{.underline}, [seen here conducting live fire
exercises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkgeladdlaI), [is
devastatingly effective in the right operational context]{.underline}.
In Brazil, the government [used it to destroy drug smugglers'
hideouts](https://warisboring.com/the-best-little-air-force-youre-barely-aware-of-9eea17dedf55) deep
in the jungle. The Colombian Air Force used the Super Tucano over the
last decade to [strike targets across large parts of the
country](https://warisboring.com/the-deadly-super-tucanos-of-south-america-32934b879627) controlled
by the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) insurgent
group. [Afghanistan's fledgling air force is [using its 20 new Super

[Boko Haram]{.underline}, however, [is a more slippery target than the

Washi[ngton's sale of C-130 military transport planes to Nigeria in the

goodwill over the year]{.underline}s. Despite being relied upon to ferry

On August 3, 2017, [DoD issued a press release 1 announcing the approval
of the sale to Nigeria of twelve Embraer A-29 Super Tucano aircraft and
weapons, valued at an estimated \$593 million]{.underline}.2 Super
Tucanos are armed with two wing-mounted machine guns and can carry up to
1,550 kg (3,417 pounds) of munitions and ordnance.3 [The public
announcement was made 198 days after the Nigerian Air Force killed an
estimated 115 civilians in the errant bombing of a refugee camp in Rann,
Borno State on January 17, 2017]{.underline}.4 The [Nigerian Air Force
insisted that the strike was an accident and set up two boards of
inquiry to investigate after the event, at least partly in response to
international criticism]{.underline}. [Nigerian Air
Commodore]{.underline} Adesanya, Director of Public Relations and
Information for the Nigerian Air Force, [released a statement on July
24, 2017 acknowledging military responsibility for the
incident]{.underline};5 however, no [investigation results have been
made public at the time of writi]{.underline}ng, and concerns about the
lack of transparency and accountability for those involved persist.6

Three months prior to the announcement of the sale, [several prominent
human rights organizations expressed concerns about the sale in a letter
to Congress, citing the "lack of adequate safeguards and accountability
mechanisms to ensure that the Tucano aircraft would be used consistently
with international human rights and humanitarian law by the Nigerian
military]{.underline}".7 The [Rann bombing was one of a succession of
similar incidents that led to civilian casualties, and the letter echoed
concerns the organizations had raised in a separate letter a year
prior]{.underline}. According to Human Rights Watch, **[bombings
conducted on two prior occasions by the Nigerian Air Force killed up to
30 civilians in two separate villages]{.underline}**.8 On June 8,
Senators Corey Booker and Rand Paul sent a letter to Secretary of State
Rex Tillerson in which they too expressed concerns over the possible
sale, warning that [the "decision to proceed with this sale will empower
the government to backtrack even further on its commitments to human
rights, accountability, and upholding international humanitarian law,
which in turn could spur greater unrest and violence, particularly in
the northeastern part of the country"]{.underline}.9

To address the concerns raised by Congress and NGOs, as well as many in
the US government itself regarding the Nigerian armed forces' competence
and willingness to reduce the risk of future accidents and civilian
casualties, DSCA noted in its release that the sale would be accompanied
by "special training on the law of armed conflict and human rights, and
air-to-ground integration to minimize civilian harm in air
operations."10 This public commitment to customize training on the basis
of risk may signal a welcome change to the status quo of arms sales.

[The sale of the Super Tucanos raises additional questions given the
real counterterrorism needs of the Nigerian military. As observed
by]{.underline} Matthew [Page, until recently the State Department's top
expert on Nigeria:]{.underline}

\[The Super Tucano\] is devastatingly effective in the right operational
context \[\....\] [Boko Haram]{.underline}, however, [is a more slippery
target than the Taliban, FARC, or narcotraffickers' Amazonian
airstrips]{.underline}. [The Super Tucano's unique capabilities might
have been handy two years ago, when Boko Haram controlled large parts of
three northeastern states]{.underline}. Even then, however,
**[terrorist-held towns and villages housed many
civilians]{.underline}**. **[Experts agree that new warplanes will be
less effective now that the group has dispersed and is once again
operating clandestinely and conducting asymmetric
attacks.]{.underline}** Boko Haram fighters no longer operate en masse
and many have taken refuge in remote communities in the Mandara
Mountains or on the islands of Lake Chad. [Even the Sambisa
Forest**---the group's traditional stronghold--- is not well suited to
aerial bombardment....** hundreds of camp followers**---mostly women and
children---live among the terrorists sheltering there.**]{.underline}11

Page also noted **[the staggering cost of the aircraft relative to
Nigeria's resources, which amounts to "roughly half of Nigeria's 2016
defense budget]{.underline}** and over [twice as much as the Nigerian
Army's entire annual salary bill," funds that could "address long-term
drivers of conflict like chronic underdevelopment, poverty, and food
insecurity]{.underline}."12

[While allocating Nigeria's budget is not the responsibility of the US
government, US officials are responsible for working with partner
governments tomatch desired items with legitimate defense needs and real
capabilities]{.underline}, as described in the Pre-Case Development and
Evaluation phases of the FMS process. The sale therefore calls into
question how the Departments of State and Defense arrived at the
conclusion that the Super Tucanos corresponded strongly enough with a
legitimate security need to warrant approval of the sale in light of the
risks involved.

### IL -- Arms Sales =\> Boko Haram Recruitment 

#### Human rights abuses by Nigeria fuel terrorist recruitment

**Margon, 14**- Washington Director of Human Rights Watch(Sarah,
Testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee On Africa,
Global Health, Global Human Rights and International Organizations
"Human Rights Vetting: Nigeria and Beyond," 7-10-14 ProQuest)// gcd

Ms. Margon. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, thank you for inviting me to
testify today. I am really pleased this subcommittee is looking at the
details of human rights vetting and its application in Nigeria and
beyond.

It is a timely hearing, given the impending U.S. redeployment from
Afghanistan and the inevitable shift in resources and priorities that
will occur. In fact, this shift has already begun with President
Obama\'s recent creation of the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund and
other correlated efforts to strengthen the capabilities of foreign
military partners.

It is a renewed and expanded approach to security assistance that calls
for reinvigorated attention to [[the Leahy law]{.underline}]{.mark} as
[[a critical tool to finding the right balance between incentivizing
institutional reform and addressing ongoing and systemic abuses that
undermine larger U.S. security goals.]{.underline}]{.mark}

As you have noted, Mr. Chairman, [[the Leahy laws are an important means
to ensure that the U.S. is not complicit in grave human rights abuses
abroad, and that it upholds its international legal
obligations]{.underline}]{.mark}. But it also makes sense within the
larger foreign policy context, since [[militaries that commit abuses can
also exacerbate longstanding grievances, escalate atrocities, foment
political instability, and provide abusive armed opposition groups and
terrorist organizations with a very powerful recruiting
tool]{.mark}.]{.underline}

As examples, I would like to talk a little bit about our research in
Nigeria, and then move off the continent for a second to talk about
Iraq, given that it has returned to media pretty heavily.

Since long before the Chibok abductions, and the Bring Back Our Girls
campaign captured the world\'s attention, [Human Rights Watch has been
reporting on the crisis in northern Nigeria and the serious abuses the
security forces have perpetrated in responding to it]{.underline}. In
2009, we denounced the government\'s killing, while in custody, of Boko
Haram leader Mohammed Yusuf and many others, acts which are widely
believed to have spurned further violence by the group.

In October 2012, we released a report that looked not only at Boko
Haram\'s atrocities, but also [at the impact of Nigeria\'s heavy-handed
security response. We found that in an attempt to halt increasing
violent attacks between 2010 and 2012, Nigeria\'s security forces killed
hundreds of Boko Haram suspects, along with members of local communities
who were apparently attacked at random]{.underline}. Our research made
clear that the members of the security force used excessive force, were
physically abusive, detained suspects secretly, stole money, and burned
homes.

In May 2013, Human Rights Watch issued another report examining massive
destruction in the northern town of Baga[. We used satellite imagery and
witness evidence to confirm that while Boko Haram did attack a military
patrol, kill a soldier, and wound five others, the government\'s
response was directed at the local community, as government forces
burned homes and killed local residents.]{.underline}

Our satellite images actually indicated high levels of building
destruction, but because we were not able to visit the north we weren\'t
able to confirm death figures from witnesses of almost 200 people.

[Security force abuse in Nigeria is not limited to the Boko Haram
crisis, as I am sure you know. It is deeply systemic.]{.underline} Over
the years, we have documented many cases of abuse and apparent
indiscriminate or [excessive use of force outside of insurgency-related
situations, from the oil-producing Niger Delta region, to arbitrary
killings in response to intercommunal violence in Nigeria\'s middle
belt]{.underline}, to [political violence that often accompanies
elections at all levels of governme]{.underline}nt, to even small events
such as one that occurred about a 1\\1/2\\ weeks ago in the city of
Lagos, where it appeared soldiers went on a bus-burning rampage,
randomly beating and harassing city residents after a bus ran over and
killed one of their fellow fighters earlier that morning.

[This abusive conduct completely undermines the security force\'s
effectiveness and creates strong resentment within the communities they
are ostensibly there to]{.underline} protect. In the case of Boko Haram,
[many Nigerians have expressed reluctance to share any information that
might help stop the group]{.underline}, because they are afraid it will
be used against them.

Worse still, [the Nigerian Government has largely failed to undertake
any kind of credible investigation in the ongoing and pervasive
security]{.underline} force abuses that have repeatedly been brought to
their attention. [More than 10 years on, the government has still not
held any members of the security forces accountable for a 2001 massacre
of more than 200 people in Benue State.]{.underline}

#### Army Behavior in the Lake Chad area are destroying U.S HR cred and strengthening a resurgent Boko Haram by fueling its recruitment

**Matfess 17** -- doctoral candidate in political science at Yale
University whose research focuses on insurgencies and gender dynamics in
sub-Saharan Africa. (Hilary, \"In Partnering With Nigeria's Abusive
Military, the U.S. Is Giving Boko Haram a Lifeline,\" World Politics

10-24-2017)

Given that Maiduguri is where Boko Haram was founded, it might have been
reasonable to suspect that the group was behind the raid. Having formed
in the early 2000s as a largely nonviolent dissident sect, Boko Haram
launched an insurgency in 2009 that has displaced millions and,
according to Amnesty International, killed more than 20,000 people. [The
insurgency's devastation has triggered a broader food shortage and
humanitarian crisis in the Lake Chad basin.]{.underline} As it turned
out, however, [the assault on the U.N. compound was actually perpetrated
by members of the Nigerian military]{.underline}. According to an
internal U.N. memo obtained by AFP, the [Nigerian soldiers may have
[been acting on a far-fetched
rumor](http://www.dw.com/en/nigerian-forces-conduct-unauthorized-search-of-un-main-base/a-40059452)
circulating on social media that Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau,
was being housed there.]{.underline} Those familiar with humanitarian
aid operations in sub-Saharan Africa describe the raid as unprecedented,
and say it's stunning that the military would engage in such an
operation on the basis of nothing more, apparently, than a rash of
WhatsApp messages. Even more shocking, though, is the silence of the
international community in the wake of the incident. While a spokeswoman
for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said
the U.N. was "extremely concerned" about what happened, [Nigeria's other
partners kept quiet. Given that the United States is a significant
military partner of Nigeria, the lack of condemnation from U.S.
officials of what likely amounted to a violation of international
humanitarian law was especially jarring.]{.underline} Yet Washington's
silence is consistent with a broader pattern: **[The U.S. has routinely
turned a blind eye to abuses by the Nigerian military in the northeast
of the country despite the fact that the U.S. is supporting Nigerian
forces battling Boko Haram.]{.underline}** So far, there is every
indication that [this bilateral military engagement will continue
under]{.underline} President Donald [Trump]{.underline}. In early
August, a little more than a week before the U.N. raid, [the U.S.
[approved the
sale](https://www.defensenews.com/air/2017/08/03/us-approves-a-29-super-tucano-sale-to-nigeria/)
of some \$593 million in military hardware and training to Nigeria. The
transaction's big-ticket item was a dozen A-29 Super Tucano light-attack
aircraft.]{.underline} The Nigerian government had originally sought
permission to procure the aircraft in 2015, but the military's human
rights record prompted the Obama administration to put the sale on hold.
[In particular, the Nigerian air force has been accused of bombing
civilians on multiple occasions, including a January strike on a camp
for displaced people in Rann, in the northeastern state of Borno, that
killed at least 100 people, [according to The Associated
Press](https://www.apnews.com/a3d177b5c7254fabb5bdea37d7a93379/Trump-to-sell-attack-planes-to-Nigeria-for-Boko-Haram-fight)]{.underline}.
The Rann bombing is an extreme example of an array of abuses, including
arbitrary detentions and extrajudicial killings, committed by Nigerian
security forces in the campaign against Boko Haram. [These abuses
persist even as the government of President Muhammadu Buhari has
undertaken a concerted effort to lionize Nigerian soldiers as national
heroes. **Tactics used by Nigeria's military in the fight against Boko
Haram make it easier for the group to recruit**]{.underline}. A frequent
refrain in Washington policy circles, on the rare occasions when events
in Africa manage to break through the frenetic domestic news cycle of
the Trump era, is that it is imperative to depend on "strategic regional
partners" to advance America's security objectives. But **[while
security partnerships, both multilateral and bilateral, are a valuable
component of America's national security toolkit, events in the Lake
Chad basin suggest that Washington's strategic partners are engaging in
counterproductive behavior]{.underline}**. A recent report published by
the U.N. Development Program, titled "[Journey Into Extremism in
Africa](http://journey-to-extremism.undp.org/content/downloads/UNDP-JourneyToExtremism-report-2017-english.pdf),"
draws from [interviews with former combatants in Nigeria, Mali and
Somalia to show that many people who join extremist groups have suffered
abuses at the hands of the security sector. The takeaway is clear:
Combating terrorist groups with tactics that make it easier for them to
recruit is quite literally self-defeating. The behavior of the Nigerian
military, therefore, demands that Washington recalibrate its security
strategy in the region, emphasizing professionalization over weapons
acquisition and improved capacity for combat.]{.underline} As
Destructive as Boko Haram The Nigerian military's abuses in the fight
against Boko Haram are so extensive that they are the subject of an
ongoing investigation by the International Criminal Court.
[Extrajudicial killings and illegal detention practices have been
documented at length by several nongovernmental organizations, including
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.]{.underline} Among the
most comprehensive and distressing accounts was a 2015 report by Amnesty
International titled "[Stars on Their Shoulders, Blood on Their
Hands](https://www.amnestyusa.org/reports/stars-on-their-shoulders-blood-on-their-hands-war-crimes-committed-by-the-nigerian-military/),"
which tallied more than 7,000 deaths in Nigerian government detention
centers, 1,200 additional extrajudicial killings and the arbitrary
arrest of more than 20,000 people in counterterrorism operations.
According to Amnesty, the military "extrajudicially executed people
after they had been captured and when they presented no danger." The
victims included people who "were shot dead inside detention facilities,
while others were either shot or had their throats cut after being
captured during cordon-and-search operations." In one especially
gruesome incident, [soldiers responding to a Boko Haram attack in the
northeastern town of Baga in April 2013 carried out a "mop-up" operation
that killed nearly 200 people. More recent accounts from activist groups
and people living in the Lake Chad basin suggest these abusive practices
have continued.]{.underline} A woman I interviewed in December 2015 in
the Fufore refugee camp, located in the northeastern state of Adamawa,
survived attacks by both Boko Haram and the army. She said that of the
two, [the army left more destruction in its wake. "My town was along the
Boko Haram route, so they attacked us regularly but never ruled over
us," said the woman, who is from Borno and who spoke on condition of
anonymity for her safety. "We were just trapped in our
town."]{.underline} But when the soldiers came, the woman said, they
"burned all of our houses and our fields." She said she had no time to
collect her possessions before the inferno began. Another woman from the
town of Walasah, also in Borno, similarly reported that when the
Nigerian army entered her community, "They did not stop to ask who was
Boko Haram; they just burned down the whole village." [For civilians, it
makes little difference if a village is burned by Boko Haram insurgents
or by soldiers. They are left without their livelihoods and property,
facing an uncertain future.]{.underline} **[The Nigerian military often
claims that such fires are set by Boko Haram. However, this contradicts
the testimony of displaced people, journalists and even some military
personnel.]{.underline}** While there is arguably a strategic
justification for burning villages---namely, to deprive Boko Haram of
resources to loot---the same cannot be said for other abuses carried out
during village raids, which seem to be the result not of strategic
logic, but rather a lack of professionalism. A [UNICEF employee who has
worked on protection issues throughout northern Nigeria reported that,
in March 2016, when Nigerian soldiers entered communities in Adamawa to
liberate them from Boko Haram's rule, the soldiers announced they would
"kill local men and take their wives]{.underline}." Some Nigerians who
have survived attacks by both Boko Haram and the army say the army is
more destructive. [With a resigned shrug, the aid worker said, "You can
never have security forces acting to code 100 percent of the time
anywhere." Yet in Nigeria's case, such behavior has hampered
counterinsurgency efforts by reducing citizens' trust in the
military. ]{.underline}

WHY NIGERIA MATTERS

[Africa is a critical geostrategic priority for the United States due to
its sustained economic growth, abundant natural resources, and growing
entrepreneur class.\[]{.underline}4\] Within Africa, [Nigeria is,
relatively speaking, a super-power---the largest economy, the largest
producer of oil, and the most populated]{.underline}.\[5\] Economically,
[Nigeria runs a trade surplus with the United States importing over
\$5.5 billion in U.S. goods annually]{.underline}.\[6\] Despite
experiencing a slight recession in 2016 for the first time in two
decades, [the Nigerian economy continues to recover thanks to gross
domestic product growth in 2017 and even better estimates for
2018]{.underline}.\[7\] Recently, much of the recovery is anchored by
increased oil and natural gas production, along with higher petroleum
prices. [Though abundant in many natural resources, oil and natural gas
are the country's mainstays. Nigeria is Africa's largest petroleum
producer, 12th largest in the world, and boasts the largest natural gas
reserves on the continent]{.underline}.\[8\] Astoundingly, [Nigeria is
also the world's fourth largest democracy, and the population is
projected to surpass that of the United States before 2050---Nigeria is
on track to become the third largest country in the world in just over
three decade]{.underline}s.\[9\] As the beacon of Africa, **[the
long-term stability and economic growth of Nigeria is inextricably
linked to the continent's future]{.underline}**.

CONTINUING CHALLENGES TO SOVEREIGNTY

Since the [Boko Haram insurgency began in earnest in 2009, it continues
to serve as a credible challenge to sovereignty in Nigeria and other
states in the the region]{.underline}. Their stated goal is to overthrow
the Nigerian government and replace it with a religious state.\[10\]
Accordingly, the U.S. Department of State officially designated Boko
Haram a Foreign Terrorist Organization on November 14, 2013.\[11\] The
[violence perpetrated by Boko Haram is responsible for generating a
humanitarian emergency, displacing over two million people and creating
a food crisis for an additional eight million]{.underline}.\[12\] The
humanitarian and refugee crisis [also creates regional challenges to
sovereignty throughout the Lake Chad Region, to include Chad, Niger, and
Cameroon]{.underline}. These nations are unable to control their
borders, quell cross-border violence, or support the influx of displaced
persons due to already-severe humanitarian situations within their
territories. Complicating matters, Boko Haram factions are also aligning
with Islamic State factions, giving way to new streams of manning and
resources for both groups.\[13[\] The result is a distressed region in
dire need of assistance to address the Boko Haram challenge to
sovereignty.]{.underline}

Reporting(Claire, \"Nigeria's Battle With Boko Haram,\" Council on
Foreign Relations,
<https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/nigerias-battle-boko-haram> 8-8-2018)

Nigeria's record of political corruption and inequality have also
contributed to the group's rise, analysts say. [Despite being Africa's
biggest economy and home to a wealth of natural resources, Nigeria has
one of the continent's poorest populations. Roughly half of its two
hundred million people [live on less than \$1.90 per
day](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/26/africa/nigeria-overtakes-india-extreme-poverty-intl/index.html);
poverty is higher in the Muslim-majority northern regions.]{.underline}
Oil has played a major role in driving economic inequality across the
country[: A small number of elites has long maintained a tight hold on
oil revenues, and corrupt government ministers have been charged with
embezzling tens of billions of dollars from the sector.]{.underline}

"[The emergence of Boko Haram signifies the maturation of long-festering
extremist impulses that run deep in the social reality of northern
Niger]{.underline}ia," [writes analyst Chris
Ngwodo](http://chrisngwodo.blogspot.com/2010/10/understanding-boko-haram-theology-of.html).
"The group itself is an effect and not a cause; it is a symptom of
decades of failed government and elite delinquency finally ripening into
social chaos."

Since gaining independence in 1960, Nigeria has suffered waves of
political instability, including at least half a dozen coups, decades of
military rule, and a civil war (1967--1970) that claimed up to two
million lives, many perishing from a blockade-induced famine.

How did the group emerge?

In Boko Haram's formative years, Yusuf criticized northern Muslims for
participating in what he saw as an illegitimate, non-Islamic state.
"Yusuf's vision was extreme in the northern Nigeria context, but not so
extreme that it was unrecognizable," writes Alexander Thurston in
his [2017 book on the
group](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/11094.html). "In diverse ways,
most northern Muslims believe that Islam provides a framework that
should shape public life."

The group began to radicalize [amid episodic
clashes](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2010/01/201012314018187505.html) between
Christians and Muslims and as security forces adopted harsher tactics
against suspected militants. A flash point for the group came in 2009,
when a police crackdown set off an armed uprising in Bauchi State that
soon spread in the northeast. Government forces killed more than eight
hundred people, including many suspected Boko Haram members, in ensuing
protests. Following the uprising, Yusuf was murdered while in police
custody.

How has Boko Haram evolved in recent years?

Boko Haram [splintered
into](http://africanarguments.org/2016/09/20/making-sense-of-boko-harams-different-factions/) at
least two factions following Yusuf's death. Today, Abubakar Shekau heads
one faction, which appears to remain focused on fighting the Nigerian
government in the northeast. Several times, Nigeria's military claimed
to [have killed
Shekau](https://www.yahoo.com/news/nigeria-claims-killed-man-posing-boko-haram-leader-160236483.html),
but videos of the leader have emerged as recently as 2018.

For at least the last two years, Abu Musab al-Barnawi, Yusuf's son, has
led a second faction, which CFR's Campbell says has the same ultimate
goals as Shekau's but a less strict view as to what constitutes
apostasy. Some analysts say the increasingly grisly nature of Boko
Haram's atrocities [sparked
rifts](https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-islamic-states-west-africa-province) within
the group.

[Boko Haram analysts and Nigerian security officials have offered
varying assessments of the group's links to other militant Islamist
groups]{.underline}, including al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and
**[the self-proclaimed Islamic State]{.underline}**. The group declared
allegiance to the Islamic State in 2015, rebranding itself as the
Islamic State's West Africa Province. Some say that focusing on an
affiliation to these groups downplays the context in which Boko Haram
emerged. Others argue that ignoring evidence of Boko Haram's ties to
other Islamist militant groups may [hinder an
understanding](https://www.lawfareblog.com/boko-harams-al-qaeda-affiliation-response-five-myths-about-boko-haram) of
the insurgency.

What are its tactics?

Many of the group's activities are those typically associated with
terrorism, including suicide bombings, kidnappings, and destruction of
property, particularly [schools. In recent years, it has increased
attacks on soft targets, or relatively unprotected places, and used more
women and children as suicide bombers.]{.underline} Beyond Nigeria, [the
group is [most
active](https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/central-africa/cameroon/cameroon-confronting-boko-haram) in
northern Cameroon, Chad, and Niger.]{.underline}

[Boko Haram has been linked to the deaths of more than thirty-seven
thousand people since 2011]{.underline}, according to [CFR's Nigeria
Security
Tracker](https://www.cfr.org/nigeria/nigeria-security-tracker/p29483),
which monitors political violence in the country. [About half of those
killed were suspected Boko Haram militants, while roughly 45 percent
were civilians and 5 percent were security forces.]{.underline}

How has the Nigerian government responded?

Nigerian security forces have made sizable gains against Boko Haram with
the help of neighboring states, but the momentum to stamp out the
insurgent group appears to have slowed in recent years, and communities
in the country's northeast remain beleaguered.

In 2013, President Goodluck Jonathan launched a major offensive against
Boko Haram, declaring a state of emergency in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe
States. While national forces [claimed some
success](https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc272109/m1/1/high_res_d/RL33964_2013Nov15.pdf)\[PDF\]
in pushing militants out of cities, attacks in rural areas continued
with regularity. Nigerian troops [have been
accused](https://www.hrw.org/report/2012/10/11/spiraling-violence/boko-haram-attacks-and-security-force-abuses-nigeria) of
human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings.

Boko Haram attacks escalated in 2014 and 2015, raising doubts about the
government's progress toward containing the group. In particularly
brazen operations, the group claimed a [bombing of an Abuja bus
station](https://www.cfr.org/blog/nigerias-boko-haram-we-are-abuja) that
killed nearly one hundred people on April 14, 2014, the same day it
abducted more than two hundred schoolgirls from the northeastern town of
Chibok. The latter attack prompted an international outcry and evoked
harsh criticism among many Nigerians of the Jonathan administration's
slow response.

Elected president in 2015, Muhammadu Buhari has [made some modest
reforms](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R43558.pdf) \[PDF\] to improve the
military's effectiveness against Boko Haram. Buhari, a former military
dictator (1983--1985), moved the military's headquarters from Abuja to
Maiduguri, increased funding for operations in the area, and appointed
new military leadership.

What support have other states provided?  

Nigeria has sought military support from its neighbors, who increasingly
suffered attacks during Boko Haram's upsurge. Since 2015, Cameroon,
Chad, and Niger have deployed thousands of troops as part of a
multinational force authorized by the African Union. The coalition has
been credited with helping the Nigerian military [retake much of the
territory](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL33964.pdf) \[PDF\] claimed by
Boko Haram and reduce violence linked to the group to levels seen prior
to 2014.

Security partners beyond Africa have also come to Nigeria's aid. [The
United States designated Boko Haram a foreign terrorist organization in
late 2013, but at times Washington has [withheld military
assistance](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/IF10173.pdf)\[PDF\] out of
concern over Nigeria's counterterrorism strategy and alleged human
rights abuse]{.underline}s. Following the abductions in Chibok, France,
the United Kingdom, and [the United States pledged additional
assistance, including equipment and intelligence support. U.S.
assistance related to Boko Haram [totaled more than \$400
million](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R43558.pdf)\[PDF\] by early
201]{.underline}6. In early 2018, U.[S. President Donald J. Trump pushed
through a roughly \$600 million deal to sell a dozen Super Tucano
aircraft to Nigeria to support its counterterrorism
efforts.]{.underline}

For its part, [the UN Security Council imposed economic sanctions and an
arms embargo on the insurgent group in 2014]{.underline}. Analysts said
the [move was largely
symbolic](http://www.thecitizen.co.tz/oped/Will-Boko-Haram-sanctions-work-/1840568-2326780-ej412hz/index.html), as
the financial assets and movements of Boko Haram militants are difficult
to track.

What are the broader risks to the region?

[Boko Haram has fueled instability across the Lake Chad Basin. It has
displaced millions and put them at risk of starvation, jeopardized
education and health services, stalled humanitarian aid efforts, and
undercut government authority in Nigeria and abroad.]{.underline}

Boko Haram represents an ugly paradox: [its ideas have limited appeal
but significant staying power.]{.underline}

Moreover, [the insurgency has scared off international investors,
particularly in Nigeria, where it adds to a list of threats that
includes other militant groups, which target oil infrastructure in the
Niger Delta, and sectarian conflict in the country's Middle Belt.
Foreign direct investment inflows to the country have plummeted since
2011, falling from a high of almost \$9 billion to \$3.5 billion in
2017.]{.underline}

[Recent attacks and
abductions](https://ctc.usma.edu/the-terrorist-calculus-in-kidnapping-girls-in-nigeria-cases-from-chibok-and-dapchi/) signal
that, despite being pushed into remote areas, **[Boko Haram will likely
continue to disrupt the region's development for some time. "Boko Haram
represents an ugly paradox: its ideas have limited appeal but
significant staying power. The group can be crushed militarily, yet
state violence fuels its narrative of victimhood,"]{.underline}** writes
Thurston.

### S -- Leahy Laws

#### Leahy Law doesn't currently block FMS and DCS to Nigeria \-\-- applying the law would help the government effectively combat Boko Haram

- helps ensure that Nigerian forces operate as professional soldiers and
  law officers and that they are seen as accountable to the law

**Lumpe & Pray, 15** \-\-- Senior Policy staff at Open Society
Foundations (7/25/15, Lora & Sarah, AllAfrica.com, "How the Leahy Law
Can Help Nigeria," proquest database)

The [Leahy Law does not apply to arms sales financed with Nigeria\'s own
funds. It **only applies to assistance being drawn from the U.S.
Treasury**]{.underline}. [Decisions by]{.underline} the
[Obama]{.underline} Administration [to refrain from selling U.S. weapons
or technologies to Nigeria in the recent past may have been due to
concerns about the human rights (or corruption) record of Nigerian
forces, but those decisions **were not based on the Leahy
Law**]{.underline}.

In a speech at the U.S. Institute of Peace that largely focused on his
desire to address impunity and corruption in his country, President
Muhammadu Buhari mischaracterised the U.S. law known as the \"Leahy
Law.\" He asserted that application of this law by the U.S. Government
\"has aided and abetted Boko Haram\" by denying the Nigerian government
sophisticated weaponry. However, [the unwillingness of the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [to sell arms to
Nigeria has nothing to do with the Leahy Law, which only applies to
military assistance that is funded by the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. [The Nigerian
government has had challenges procuring weapons with its own
resources.]{.underline} 

[Most importantly, **the law supports**]{.underline} President
**[Buhari\'s previously stated objective of Nigerian forces that are
accountable to rule of law]{.underline}**. As he has noted, disciplined,
accountable armed forces will do more to end the reign of Boko Haram\'s
predations than will undisciplined forces. [The Leahy Law supports this
conviction and seeks to **incentivise internal
accountability**.]{.underline} What does this law actually mandate, and
why?

Named after Senator Patrick Leahy, who authored it in 1997, the Leahy
Law originally focused only on U.S. assistance to Colombian armed
forces. He wrote the law after finding out that several Colombian army
units that massacred poor civilians had been receiving assistance and
training from the United States. Instead of cutting off all U.S. aid to
Colombian police and military, then engaged in fighting two insurgencies
and narco-traffickers, he prohibited assistance to any particular
Colombian security force units (battalions or brigades) that the U.S.
State Department believed had committed gross violations of basic human
rights until the Colombian government investigated the crimes and held
the responsible members of the units accountable.

[The law has been expanded over the years and now prevents the U.S.
government from providing U.S. taxpayer-funds to any foreign military or
police units anywhere in the world, if the U.S. government believes
those particular units have engaged in the worst human rights
violations: murder, torture, rape, and forced disappearances with
impunity.]{.underline}

In his speech, President Buhari said that the law \"has denied us access
to appropriate strategic weapons to prosecute the war against the
insurgents. In the face of abduction of innocent school girls from their
hostels, indiscriminate bombings of civilians in markets and places of
worship, our forces have remained largely impotent because they do not
possess the appropriate weapons and technology which they could have
had, had the so-called human rights violations not been an obstacle.\"

[The Leahy Law does not apply to arms sales financed with Nigeria\'s own
funds.]{.underline} It only applies to assistance being drawn from the
U.S. Treasury. Decisions by the Obama Administration to refrain from
selling U.S. weapons or technologies to Nigeria in the recent past may
have been due to concerns about the human rights (or corruption) record
of Nigerian forces, but those decisions were not based on the Leahy Law.

Moreover, in 2014 the United States provided Nigeria with at least \$5
million in military assistance grants, all of which were subject to
Leahy Law screening. In this process, [the U.S. State Department relies
on their own information and that of Nigerian and international rights
groups and the media to determine whether particular units (battalions
or brigades) have credibly been implicated in rape, prison shootings,
executions, and razing villages to the ground. If so, those units could
not receive the U.S. taxpayer funds until the Nigerian government
investigates and brings the responsible parties to book.]{.underline}

Even with the Leahy Law, many requests to arm and train Nigerian units
have been approved. In 2013, 187 Nigerian military units and 173
Nigerian police units - including those most likely to conduct a rescue
operation - were vetted and cleared to receive U.S. assistance. The U.S.
was also helping stand up a new counterterrorism unit until the Nigerian
government put an end to the effort.

Testifying before the Senate in February 2015, Secretary of State Kerry
said that the limiting factors on U.S. assistance to the Nigerian
military \"have to do with governance itself, choices in the military,
leadership, absence of and other problems\... not the Leahy Law.\"

President Buhari appealed directly to the Obama Administration and
Congress \"to examine how the U.S. Government can provide us with far
more substantial counter-terrorism assistance with minimal strings. The
longer we delay, the deadlier the Boko Haram gets.\"

As Senator Leahy notes on his website, **[the Leahy Law \"provides the
necessary flexibility to allow the U.S. to advance its foreign policy
objectives in these countries (with human rights
violations)]{.underline}**. In addition, [**it gives foreign governments
an incentive to correct the problem**: U.S. aid can resume if they bring
to justice people who commit such crimes.\"]{.underline}

**[This law should help]{.underline}** President **[Buhari in his effort
to combat Boko Haram by helping ensure that Nigerian forces operate as
professional soldiers and law officers and that they are seen as
accountable to the law]{.underline}**.

#### Leahy will sustain U.S. credibility in host countries

**Cicilline, 14**\--Member of the Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health,
Global Human Rights, and International Organizations and congressman
from New Jersey (David, Testimony before the House Foreign Affairs
Subcommittee On Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights and
International Organizations "Human Rights Vetting: Nigeria and Beyond,"
7-10-14 ProQuest)// gcd

Mr. Cicilline. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to you and Ranking
Member Bass for calling this important and timely hearing.

As we all know, the security situation in Nigeria has deteriorated
seriously in recent months with the expansion of Boko Haram, which in
April brazenly kidnapped hundreds of young schoolgirls. This committee
and this Congress passed a resolution condemning these kidnappings, and
I think we all remain committed to providing as much U.S. assistance and
advice as can be effective to support the Nigerian Government\'s efforts
to secure the return of these schoolgirls and to stem the violence of
this brutal and violent terrorist organization.

[Maintaining robust enforcement of the Leahy laws]{.underline}, which
serves as the primary safeguard, [assuring that the United States is not
contributing to human rights violations through its military foreign
assistance]{.underline} [is]{.underline}, I believe, [a **necessity if
we are to maintain credibility with local populations**]{.underline},
not to mention [do the right thing by ensuring that we are not
supporting or assisting those violating basic human rights]{.underline}.

So I look forward to hearing the testimony today, and I am particularly
interested in hearing our witnesses address [how we can move forward in
a constructive way to assist the Nigerian Government while ensuring that
the units we support honor the most basic tenets of human rights and
international law.]{.underline}

With that, I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and yield.

#### Leahy law will prevent Nigeria from getting arms that fuels corruption and systematic human rights violates

**McKinney, 16** \-\-- private security adviser with hands-on experience
in multiple conflict areas around the world (6/2/2016, Edward, "Don\'t
Bend the Law to Fight Terror in Nigeria; America shouldn't give weapons
to human-rights
abusers," <https://nationalinterest.org/feature/dont-bend-the-law-fight-terror-nigeria-16440>,
accessed on 6/22/19)

Earlier this month, the Obama administration revealed that it is poised
to sell up to twelve light attack aircraft to Nigeria in a bid to
support the country's fight against Boko Haram.

This might sound laudable at first glance, but in reality, [selling arms
to Nigeria would mean the United States essentially breaking the
so-called Leahy Law]{.underline}. Passed in 1997 by amending the Foreign
Operations Appropriations Act, it prohibits the United States from
exporting arms to "any unit of the security forces of a foreign country
if the Secretary of State has credible information that such unit has
committed a gross violation of human rights."

**[The Leahy Law's three-stage vetting process is
stringent.]{.underline}** [It]{.underline} begins with the appropriate
U.S. embassy carrying background checks on the individuals or units
applying for assistance, by analyzing the Department of State (DoS)
International Vetting and Security Tracking (INVEST) system, DoS Country
Reports, cooperating with local police forces or even interviewing
individual victims where necessary. If any credible information is
found, the embassy can bar further support or refer to Washington.

In Washington, [the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and
Labor]{.underline} (DRL) [receives the results of the ambassadorial
vetting and conducts investigations of its own]{.underline}. Again, [if
credible information that the violation or issue is serious enough to
prohibit U.S. involvement is found, support is refused and the findings
recorded in INVEST.]{.underline} Lastly, if further review of the
information is required, [then DRL will assemble a broader team of State
Department representatives, who may request further information from the
embassy in the country in question before a decision is
made]{.underline}. With such a meticulous evaluation process[, it is
puzzling that there is any expectation that the Nigerian military will
possibly pass the test.]{.underline}

Indeed, [the Nigerian military is currently being investigated by
the]{.underline} International Criminal Court [(ICC) on charges of
illegal killings and unlawful incarcerations]{.underline}. In June of
last year, an Amnesty International report claimed that, in the course
of Nigeria's war against Boko Haram, brutal conditions while in
government detention have led to the death of at least seven thousand
people, while an [additional 1,200 have been "extrajudicially executed"
by Nigerian security forces. A further twenty thousand have been
"arbitrarily arrested."]{.underline}

And the man elected to clean up the country, President Muhammadu
[Buhari, seems to be either thoroughly naive or thoroughly
complacent]{.underline}. In June of last year, [he called for a lifting
of the Leahy Laws, arguing that the "unproven allegations" of Nigerian
security forces' human-rights violations had rendered his forces
impotent against the might of Boko Haram]{.underline}. His statement
ignored two very crucial facts. The first that, as the later proven
human-rights abuses showed, the Nigerian military was certainly not
sitting on its hands waiting **[for U.S. support in the fight against
Boko Haram and second, the application of the Leahy Laws, never results
in a "blanket ban" on whole countries, it is individuals or units who
are assessed before assistance is either granted or
refused.]{.underline}**

[Buhari's questionable relationship with reality came to the forefront
once more in December 2015]{.underline}, when he declared that Boko
Haram had been "technically defeated"---a curious statement given the
fact that the group's body count rose by 62 percent in 2015, and in the
first quarter of 2016 more than thirty-six attacks that left 422 dead
were staged. And worryingly, [Muslim herdsmen of the Fulani tribe also
seem responsive to the clarion call of Islamic extremism, launching
systematic attacks on the people of the largely Christian Benue state in
north central Nigeria.]{.underline}

[Terrorism and human-rights abuses aside, the country is]{.underline},
in UK Prime Minister David Cameron's words, ["fantastically
corrupt."]{.underline} And despite Buhari's spokesman Garba Shehu
retorting that Cameron "must be looking at an old snapshot of Nigeria,"
the evidence suggests otherwise. **[In a survey of 168 countries carried
out by Transparency International in its annual "Corruption Perception
Index," Nigeria ranks thirty-second from bottom]{.underline}**. Sambo
Dasuki, a former national security advisor in charge of weapons
procurement was arrested in 2015 and [accused of "stealing more than \$2
billion from the military" by awarding phantom contracts to buy twelve
helicopters, four fighter jets, bombs and ammunition---they were never
delivered.]{.underline}

**[In a country like Nigeria, adding weapons contracts would only fan
the flames of corruption and provide]{.underline}**, quite literally,
[**further ammunition to an army that is already making a name for
itself for its flagrant disregard of human rights**.]{.underline} The
Leahy Law is there for a very good reason. The process of vetting
individuals and countries is rigorous, and individuals and entities are
considered on a case-by-case basis.

[If Nigeria's military keeps failing the assessment, the solution is for
it to address the serious issues that permeate the nation, not for
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [to
bend the rules. ]{.underline}

#### Increased Leahy Law enforcement increases deployment, diplomatic connections and inter-military connections-increasing funding of vetting is necessary

**Aubrey, 14**- Retired Colonel and President of Strategic Opportunities
International( Peter, Testimony before the House Foreign Affairs
Subcommittee On Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights and
International Organizations "Human Rights Vetting: Nigeria and Beyond,"
7-10-14 ProQuest)// gcd

Colonel Aubrey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I agree with Lauren about the
ICRC. The only thing I would say, if\--having dealt with the Nigerian
Army, if they are putting it on their Web site, I assume it has the
blessings from the highest level, and that means it is probably being
checked.

As we all know, you know, soldiers do what they know that their officers
are checking on. If they are taking it seriously, it is a positive
movement forward.

Trafficking, I understand what you are saying. I know that any military
member going into the SOUTHCOM area, one of the things that is required
for entry is to complete\--it is listed under force protection, but it
really is training on human trafficking.

It is, once again, things that get checked, people do. If they are
sitting down there\--if that is a standard that becomes across the
board, you will see a greater emphasis from the military. Obviously, in
the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility, human trafficking had been a
concern for the SOUTHCOM commander, and he acted accordingly.

INVEST\--I understand the State Department has 13 people doing it. Mr.
Rickard\'s number was 530,000 units checked. With one boss and 12
workers, that is a horrendous workload. I defer to Ms. Margon\'s bit
about \$5 million is much better than the \$2 million. Obviously, it is
a huge workload when you look at U.S. global engagement and having to
validate a significant number of military units globally.

And the last comment on vetting, for that particular mission, we were
able to reschedule. [U.S. Army Africa has no dedicated forces to it. It
is a headquarters. The Army\'s solution for that is to implement
through\--on the global manning process is to earmark what they call the
regionally aligned force]{.underline}. And every year [an Army brigade
or a brigade equivalent is designated to the combatant commander to use
for engagement opportunities.]{.underline}

[There are finite periods]{.underline}. You know, [that brigade
commander or that unit commander has requirements that he or she has to
meet]{.underline}. If they cannot deploy because the unit to be trained
has not been vetted, it\--you know, [it will depend on what else the
United States Army has earmarked for that unit the next quarter or the
next fiscal year]{.underline}.

It [might not ever recur. It could be an opportunity lost. It is very
much dependent on the particular training being desired and when it is
being scheduled.]{.underline}

Mr. Smith. Colonel, before going to Ms. Massimino, did you find that the
names that were tendered to you were more likely to be pre-cleared and
to be of soldiers who are likely to make it, so in a way it is already
having a laudatory effect on the Nigerian Army? And does it then begin
to create a culture where human rights are the way forward for a soldier
to really make it in the military, particularly if he is
career-oriented?

Colonel Aubrey. [The quality of U.S. training is superb. Most foreign
nations\--much broader than just Nigeria\--select their best and
brightest to come to the United States to go to our
schools]{.underline}. So it is definitely a [career enhancing move to be
selected to come to the United States under the IMET
program.]{.underline}

For training in theater, our soldiers are good. The [quality of training
that we give is good. Their soldiers benefit. So, yes, it would be a
career-enhancing move to it.]{.underline}

As far as pre-clear on vetting, the Nigerians, when I was there, they
understood what our requirements were. [They knew far enough in advance
because we were talking battalion level training, that we would check
the names of every member of that battalion, and they had enough time to
do it]{.underline}. And there was the political will at that time\--and
it was already addressed as\-- you know, then, [peace support operations
was very important to Abuja.]{.underline}

ASO Iraq did what was necessary and had the defense establishment do
what was necessary to meet those terms. It is still, what is their
political will to do so?

Mr. Smith. Thank you.

Ms. Massimino?

Ms. Massimino. Thank you. I don\'t have a lot to add to that. I want to
also say that I don\'t know the content of the ICRC training for the
Nigerian military, but I can\'t imagine that that is not a huge net
plus, to have that happening. So it is good to hear that.

On trafficking, I am really glad you brought that up. [I know that Leahy
vetting sometimes includes things beyond what the law requires, but I
would be also curious to know, and I don\'t know, whether engagement in
trafficking by militaries is part of that]{.underline}.

I don\'t think I have had a chance to talk to you yet about the fact
that Human Rights First is launching a major campaign on
anti-trafficking efforts. And at a recent meeting with General Kelly,
SOUTHCOM, at the human rights roundtable, we had a specific discussion
about the concerns that criminal networks engaging in human trafficking
are diversified and also are, you know, supporting terrorism, and it is
becoming one large weapons, people, drugs, and terrorism network, profit
network.

And so you could certainly make an argument that it ought to be, and I
[think we are going to be working closely with the U.S. military and
others to try to ramp up efforts to identify those in foreign militaries
that are engaging in trafficking.]{.underline}

And then, on the appeals process, Ms. Blanchard is far more
knowledgeable about that than I am, but I did want to flag this, because
it goes back to the importance of the duty to inform. [Leahy really,
again, to get the full benefit, it is not really going to work unless we
are telling the people who are being excluded why they are being
excluded, and then start working with them.]{.underline}

And I think there is sometimes a reluctance to do that, to make the
relationship awkward, or we don\'t want to, or the governments aren\'t
going to like it, and that has bled into sometimes kind of putting
people in a strategic limbo where there is not a decision made. [They
don\'t want to make a negative decision, so they just put them in a
closet and it never gets made. And that is not helpful
either.]{.underline}

So those are things that it would be good to find some ways to tackle.

Ms. Margon. Just very quickly, you know, I think on the \$5 million, my
response will speak both to the \$5 million in the Senate appropriations
bill and the tensions. What is very important to remember about Leahy is
that there is both an Embassy side of this, so the U.S. Embassies are
taking care of this, and there is the Washington side. That can breed
tensions, not just along civ-mil lines, but also from posts back to
Washington.

The \$5 million, if you think about it, there is at least \$15 billion
of security assistance globally, the centerpiece of the President\'s
counterterrorism plans as we redeploy from Afghanistan, is going to be
this Counterterrorism Partnership Fund[. Five million dollars to do the
vetting is, assuming it is legislated correctly with Leahy requirements,
we would hope, is that that is what needs to happen]{.underline}. It is
[a basic need to continue to expand the vetting pool that
way.]{.underline}

So it would go to basic things like [supporting staff and computers in
Washington, but also enabling the Embassies]{.underline}, as I
understand, to be better trained. It is desperately needed, and in the
grand scheme it is not a lot of money to help move the process forward
and make it easier, so [when defense attaches at post have to do this
vetting, it doesn\'t result in delay]{.underline}s, [it doesn\'t result
in a misunderstanding, and names dropped off of people who should
be.]{.underline}

The final thing that I would just mention is on the trafficking. As far
as I understand, Leahy doesn\'t cover trafficking, since we are looking
at just the gross human rights violations. But what I think it is
important to note is that Leahy often works hand in glove with other
conditions that have been put on through various bills, appropriations,
and otherwise.

I think what we have seen in Indonesia and the Philippines is [that
Leahy has been the minimal basis along with some other conditions that
have helped move those countries in the right direction.]{.underline}
And so in considering next steps on trafficking, it may not mean Leahy
has to change per se, but that [there are additional alternative
expansions that can be made and other bills that can work in a
correlated way]{.underline}.

Mr. Smith. Thank you. And just to add for your consideration, but I do
think section 502(b) and the language clearly would cover trafficking.
Look at the disappearance of persons, degrading treatment, cruel and
inhuman, I mean, it is ready-made for that.

We will ask the administration, if they haven\'t, if they will include
it, because it needs to be I think, and get the TIP office to weigh in
as well, hopefully they will agree.

I do have one final question, and maybe\--Ms. Blanchard, you answered
it, [but the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund, the \$5 billion proposal
which had legislative language\--and I read the language and it right
from your testimony, which came up on June 26, so just a few weeks
ago\--seems to not include the Leahy amendment.]{.underline}

I mean, with notwithstanding language red flags go up as soon as that
language is anywhere, and it says notwithstanding any limitation in the
provision of law that would otherwise restrict the amount or recipients
of such support, [does this bypass Leahy? Or am I misreading the
language?]{.underline}

Ms. Blanchard. [It could potentially, if enacted in that
way.]{.underline} And the difficulty with these notwithstanding
provisions, [we don\'t always know how they are
implemented]{.underline}. So it is not always clear when the
administration makes a policy decision to use that notwithstanding
authority or not.

But, yes, potentially that could, if that makes it into law, leave ways
to\--I [don\'t want to use the term \`\`go around Leahy,\'\' but
potentially.]{.underline}

If I could make one comment, CRS doesn\'t make policy recommendations,
but on the issues of resources for vetting the new DoD definition of
\`\`assistance,\'\' again, significantly broadens the amount of security
assistance-type activities that the State Department will now have to be
vetting for. And DoD is still, to my understanding, working on the
definition of what all that includes, but it is significantly larger
than the training that they were vetting for previously.

[And if you then add on top of this the potential \$5 billion new
counterterrorism capacity-building program, that is a massive potential
amount of vetting that needs to be done.]{.underline}

Ms. Massimino. Yes. I just wanted to underscore that that is also in our
recommendations about the \$4 billion for the Counterterrorism
Partnership Fund. And it is a huge red flag, and I think it is hard to
understand that language in any other way. But Congress has an
opportunity. You should not let that go past.

If [there is, you know, any place where the Leahy vetting requirements
should really be, you know, doubled down on, it is in this new strategy
that the United States has for countering terrorism]{.underline} through
these partnerships. That makes [Leahy even more critical than it has
ever been]{.underline}. And if this goes through with that
notwithstanding language in it, it risks really gutting these important
human rights laws.

Ms. Margon. I would second that. It is a huge red flag for us, and very,
very concerning. And it doesn\'t quite align with what the President
said in his West Point speech. And if you look at the Syrian opposition,
nobody in the administration talks about this new fund to go to the
Syrian opposition unless they are talking about the vetted Syrian
opposition.

And so the language that was sent up to Capitol Hill doesn\'t meet with
the rhetoric that we have been hearing out of the administration, so it
is very worrisome if it is implemented in that way.

Mr. Smith. I do have one final question, because I did ask about INVEST.
The Google search, INVEST\--and thank you for your patience, especially
with that very long voting that we had on the House floor, but\--and
then the input that comes in from NGOs and the human rights community,
does the State Department, and DRL in particular, as well as the
Embassies, have a sufficiently broad net to receive information from
whistleblowers and people who\--like a mayor who may know of something
that needs to be told about what happened in his city, or an NGO that is
indigenous in Nigeria, are we getting enough by way of a channel of
information in that third part of the information flow?

Yes?

Ms. Margon. I can talk about that a tiny bit, since we do a lot of the
work. I think, again, it depends. It is case by case. It depends a lot
on both the international and local organizations, the contacts that the
officers have with the defense attache, and the political officers in
the Embassy.

In the case of Nigeria, I think there is a lot of information flow. For
Human Rights Watch, one of the things we have been trying to do a better
job on [when we do our research and reporting is be as clear as we can
about the units that we observe and to get the information that will
enhance Leahy vetting,]{.underline} whether it be the name we are told
repeatedly from the State Department, date of birth, which obviously is
very hard to get, but [we try to include as much specific detailed
information as we can to help that, and to pass that through both the
Embassy channels and then back it up here in Washington]{.underline}.

And we work with some of the local organizations to do that as well, and
we encourage the Embassy officers to reach out and to hold meetings in
as much capacity as they can.

Mr. Smith. Yes?

Ms. Massimino. Again, I would just underscore that there are these human
rights defender principles that, if they were fully implemented
everywhere, there is nothing about them that specifically relates to
Leahy, but it would in essence make it the practice of the U.S.
Government to establish the kinds and depths of relationships with NGOs
in these countries that would produce more detailed information that
would make the Leahy vetting process work better.

Mr. Smith. Yes. Ms. Blanchard?

Ms. Blanchard. One comment on the INVEST system. I think this online
database is an incredible tool. You mentioned the issue of trafficking
earlier. From my understanding, the State Department is trying to input
a variety of other not necessarily gross human rights abuse related
information, including on corruption and trafficking and other serious
concerns on units when they have that information. But then, of course,
that goes back to the issue of time and resources to actually put that
information into the system. So, again, going back to the 13 people
staffing this at headquarters.

Mr. Smith. I want to thank all of you for your extraordinarily incisive
testimony, the expertise that you have brought to the subcommittee. This
will be widely shared with my colleagues, and so thank you so very much,
because I think it comes at a very, very important pivotal point.

[And our hope is that more service members will be trained and trained
to be effective, but also adequately and robustly vetted for human
rights abuse]{.underline}s, so that these troops are the kind of people
we can be proud of, and [Nigerians and others in other countries can be
proud of.]{.underline}

I thank you, and the hearing is adjourned.

\[Whereupon, at 5:12 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.\]

### S -- Condition on Human Rights

#### Curbing Arms sales based on HR concerns to Nigeria solves- sends a clear signal and forces the Nigerian Army to change their behavior

University whose research focuses on insurgencies and gender dynamics in

Military, the U.S. Is Giving Boko Haram a Lifeline,\" World Politics

The Need for a New Approach \
[Nigeria is not the only country fighting Boko Haram that has received
American military assistance despite concerns about human rights abuses.
In neighboring Cameroon, which has been hit hard by Boko Haram's use of
suicide bombers, more than 2,000 of the country's soldiers were trained
by the U.S. military in 201]{.underline}5. That year, Cameroon also
received more than \$44 million in U.S. military assistance. \
But just last month, Human Rights Watch [released a
report](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/27/cameroon-mass-forced-return-nigerian-refugees) that
detailed how Cameroon's military forcibly returned 100,000 Nigerian
asylum-seekers fleeing Boko Haram, denying them access to the U.N.
refugee agency in the process. Human Rights Watch also found that
Cameroonian soldiers had engaged in physical and sexual violence against
asylum-seekers. 

**[There is a depressing contrast between chronic underfunding of the
humanitarian response in northeastern Nigeria and the seemingly
limitless funds available for military assistance.]{.underline}**

While the details of the report were alarming, such violence did not
come as a surprise to many human rights activists familiar with
Cameroon's track record. [In July, after all, Amnesty International
published a report suggesting that Cameroonian soldiers were torturing
suspected terrorists "at a base that was also frequently used by U.S.
military advisers," prompting U.S. Africa Command to launch an
investigation. \]{.underline}
Despite such allegations, [there is no sign that U.S. military
assistance to countries in the Lake Chad basin will be
curbed.]{.underline} Indeed, there is a depressing contrast between
chronic underfunding of the humanitarian response in the region and the
seemingly limitless funds available for military assistance. [As of
August, [less than
half](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/23092017_nga_ocha_ne_humanitarian_situation_update_august_2017.pdf) of
the \$1.05 billion requested by the U.N. for humanitarian programming
had been provided by donors, leaving a gap of \$545
million]{.underline}. \
No one is arguing that cultivating partnerships with regional
governments and their militaries shouldn't be a central component of
America's security strategy in Africa. However, [**these partnerships
should not be predicated on a definition of security that ignores the
threats militaries pose to their own civilian populations**. \
**As a significant donor of military and nonmilitary aid, an ostensible
proponent of international human rights norms and "[the largest exporter
of conventional weapons in the
world](https://www.upi.com/News_Photos/Features/Worlds-Top-5-arms-exporters/fp/3105/),"
the U.S. is in the best position to both demand that African militaries
become more professional, and to assist them in that process. \**
In the Lake Chad basin, a failure to do so will ultimately undermine the
goal of promoting peace and stability that prompted the U.S. to engage
militarily in the first place]{.underline}. 

### AT: Arms Sales Key to Defeat Boko Haram

#### U.S. airpower can't solve Boko Haram

Boko Haram isn't especially vulnerable to airpower.

[The Super Tucano]{.underline}, [seen here conducting live fire
exercises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkgeladdlaI), [is
devastatingly effective in the right operational context]{.underline}.
In Brazil, the government [used it to destroy drug smugglers'
hideouts](https://warisboring.com/the-best-little-air-force-youre-barely-aware-of-9eea17dedf55) deep
in the jungle. The Colombian Air Force used the Super Tucano over the
last decade to [strike targets across large parts of the
country](https://warisboring.com/the-deadly-super-tucanos-of-south-america-32934b879627) controlled
by the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) insurgent
group. [Afghanistan's fledgling air force is [using its 20 new Super

troops](http://www.military.com/daily-news/2016/05/10/a29-ground-attack-planes-tally-more-260-sorties-afghanistan.html) and
to strike concentrations of Taliban in the country's restive
south.]{.underline}

[Boko Haram]{.underline}, however, [is a more slippery target than the
Taliban, FARC, or narcotraffickers' Amazonian airstrips]{.underline}.
The Super Tucano's [unique capabilities might have been handy two years
ago, when Boko Haram [controlled large parts of three northeastern
states](http://blogs.cfr.org/campbell/2014/09/19/boko-haram-control-in-northeast-nigeria/)]{.underline}.
Even then, however, [terrorist-held towns and villages housed many
civilians]{.underline}. [Experts
agree](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-nigeria-arms-idUSKCN0XX09M) that
[new warplanes will be less effective now that the group has dispersed
and is once again operating clandestinely and conducting [asymmetric
attacks](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/29/africa/nigeria-bomb-blasts-maiduguri/index.html)]{.underline}.
**[Boko Haram fighters no longer operate en masse and many have taken
refuge in remote communities in the [Mandara Mountains or on the islands

#### Boko Haram is adapting to current counter-insurgency campaigns

**Abbott, et al 18**\-- the founder and executive director of Open
Briefing, Matthew Clarke is a researcher at Open Briefing and NGO
researcher, Scott Hickie is a senior analyst at Open Briefing. He is a
lawyer, urban planner and former political adviser (Scott, "Remote
Warfare and the Boko Haram Insurgency," Oxford Research Group,
<https://www.oxfordresearchgroup.org.uk/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=5a9c97dc-cf3e-4e4b-93ac-5ab8b306984c>
January 2018)

Despite the secrecy surrounding international involvement in the fight
against Boko Haram, it is clear that [many foreign actors are playing a
significant role in the conflict]{.underline}. [The UK, US and others
are attempting to bolster the capabilities of local and regional forces
through training, military aid and equipment, intelligence and air
support for these groups, who undertake the bulk of frontline
fighting.]{.underline}

While **[remote warfare had some initial success in the conflict, it has
not been enough to defeat the insurgency. Intelligence sharing, ISR and
armed UAVs, private military contractors and SOF advise and assist
missions have been opportunistically, not strategically, employed in the
conflict.]{.underline}** Moreover, the simple objective of the Nigerian
government and their MNJTF partners to defeat Boko Haram is not
necessarily the same objective as its foreign allies. Foreign forces
have multiple and varied reasons for participating in or supporting
operations against Boko Haram. These objectives strongly influence the
nature of the assistance provided, regardless of the economic, security
or social costs being borne by Nigeria and its neighbours.

The UK's provision of humanitarian aid and military training to Nigeria
is spurred by its status as the former colonial power. This has created
strong historical ties between the Commonwealth partners and ongoing
support programmes from London. However, its continued involvement in
combatting the insurgency is as likely driven by the desire to forge new
trade partnerships as it is by security concerns.92 [From a security
perspective, piracy in the Gulf of Guinea is more likely to preoccupy
London than the insurgency in north-eastern Nigeria.]{.underline}

Russia's limited involvement in combatting Boko Haram is likely driven
by the bi-lateral trade relationship it has built with Nigeria based on
arms sales. Discussions between Moscow and Abuja during 2017 highlight
the opportunities that the [Russian defence industry sees to supply
modern military hardware, such as Sukhoi SU-30 fighter jets, to a
regional power in Africa.]{.underline} [Training and advisory assistance
to Nigeria is provided in this context. Russia's interest is not so much
in helping defeat Boko Haram as it is in expanding its defence industry
and encouraging Nigeria and its security partners to procure Russian
military hardware]{.underline}.

[For France and the US, the motive for helping combat Boko Haram is a
combination of protecting national interests in the Lake Chad Basin and
building the capacity of regional security and trade
partners]{.underline}.93 Both countries appear to take a greater
interest in the broader security and political environment across West
Africa and the Sahel than the insurgency in north-eastern Nigeria.
Furthermore, the US objective may be to contain Boko Haram rather than
dismantle the group and defeat the insurgency, as the latter goal would
require considerable political and economic costs and risk mission
creep. Meanwhile, China is likely pre-occupied with protecting its
energy infrastructure projects and expatriate workers in Nigeria rather
than defeating Boko Haram per se.

This diversity of objectives and the incremental and reactive
application of remote warfare may be having unintended consequences.
**[Boko Haram has adapted both organisationally and tactically to the
push and pull of counter-insurgency campaigns. This first encouraged the
militants to consolidate and centralise in Sambisa Forest and then to
disburse and decentralise across Borno State, to the Nigeria-Cameroon
border and around Lake Chad.]{.underline}**

[The 2013 troop surge during the state of emergency in Nigeria forced
the insurgency to consolidate geographically. This unintentionally
created the critical mass of Boko Haram fighters required to launch
larger-scale swarm attacks against military and law enforcement
targets.]{.underline} The subsequent air and ground campaign against
Boko Haram in Sambisa Forest and the counter-terrorism operations
supported by private military contractors appears to have had the
inverse effect of dispersing and decentralising Boko Haram's presence
across the Lake Chad region.

The sustained operations against Boko Haram during 2015-16, which
included SOF training and ISR support from external actors, resulted in
the splintering of Boko Haram into multiple factions. Political and
military leaders have welcomed the fragmenting of Boko Haram, but also
decried it for stretching the limited resources of the local and
regional forces arrayed against the group and, ultimately, for making
defeating the insurgency much harder.

[The polycentric operational structure that now characterises Boko Haram
is driving the militant's use of more frequent suicide attacks on soft
targets over the last 12 months.]{.underline} These attacks require less
coordination, fighters and weapons. This tactical shift is necessitating
a corresponding shift among local and regional forces from reclaiming
territory to protecting soft targets. This is a relative move from a
proactive strategy to a reactive stance. This may negate the advantages
of remote warfare technologies and tactics, and render their further
deployment less attractive to external actors.

It is likely that more-traditional physical security measures, and a
clearer strategy, [utilising HUMINT and investing in de-radicalisation
programmes, could mitigate the rise in suicide attacks from a
decentralised group more effectively than kinetic
operations]{.underline}. In fact, prioritisation of a light footprint
approach aimed at targeting individual members of Boko Haram without a
broader strategy may impede conventional counter-terrorism operations
against Boko Haram and undermine regional stabilisation. Furthermore, it
seems likely that the incremental and reactive use of remote warfare
tactics in Nigeria has played a role in driving the adaptive
organisational restructuring and tactical repositioning of Boko Haram,
and thus resulted in the continual deferment of decisive defeat. If this
is the case, then there may be important lessons to learn that are
applicable in both Nigeria and in other theatres where insurgencies
consolidate then fragment and metastasise.

### AT: Russia Fill-in

#### Non-unique \-\-- Nigeria already receives arms from Russia

**Abbott, et al 18** -- founder and executive director of Open Briefing,

[Russian special forces have reportedly provided limited training to
Nigerian and Cameroonian forces]{.underline}. In September 2014, [Russia
hosted 400 Nigerian SOF operators for four months while Russian
instructors provided training in COIN tactics.72 This was extended to a
further 800 SOF operators in late 2014 and in 2015.]{.underline}

[Russian media reports suggest that Nigeria is purchasing 12 Su-30
fighter jets from the Moscow-based Sukhoi Company. Two of the \$30
million aircraft have already been delivered. The Su-30s will most
likely be used by the Nigerian Air Force in air-to-ground operations
against Boko Haram.]{.underline}

The Nigerian Foreign Minister, Geoffrey Onyeama, visited Russia on 1
June 2017 for bilateral talks on economic development and military
co-operation. Onyeama told the media that Nigeria was negotiating the
purchase of Russian military hardware, including helicopters, to aid
Nigerian military operations against Boko Haram. [Onyeama also
highlighted the importance of Russian intelligence sharing and Russia's
potential role as a bulwark in the UN Security Council against any
budget cuts to UN peacekeeping missions in Africa]{.underline}. In
January, [the Nigerian government had received two of the multirole
Mi-35M (Hind) attack helicopters it purchased from Russian Helicopters
in September 2015.]{.underline} The new round of negotiations included
the delivery schedule for the remaining 10 Mi-35Ms Nigeria purchased,
which will be delivered in 2018[. Two further helicopters are due for
delivery in 2018. Nigeria is also considering buying MiG fighters,
Yak-130 aircraft and various military vehicles from
Russia.74]{.underline}

The Defence Minister of Nigeria, Mansur Dan Ali, held talks with
Russia's Defence Minister, Sergei Shoigu, on the sidelines of the
International Army Games 2017 forum held in Moscow on 23 August. [The
meeting resulted in a new bilateral military cooperation and training
agreement.]{.underline} The agreement reportedly includes **[joint troop
training, peacekeeping exchanges and counter-terrorism and piracy
training]{.underline}**. The bilateral agreement is likely to underpin
further arms deals between the two countries, which the Nigerian defence
minister flagged to journalists reporting on the games. Specifically,
Ali was quoted as saying that [Nigeria is looking to procure Yakovlev
Yak-130 trainer aircraft and mineresistant vehicles.]{.underline}

[If Nigeria has its heart set on spending \$500 million on
counterterrorism gear, it could get a lot more for its
money]{.underline} than a squadron of Brazilian-American turbo-props[.
It **could**]{.underline}, for example, [**buy twice as many [MI-35M

helicopters](http://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/mi-35m-hind-e/).
Nigeria already operates the MI-35M, a versatile tool that weapon that
is rugged, well-armored, and now available with state-of-the-art
avionics**.]{.underline} Or it could train and equip [a scout sniper
company](http://www.marines.com/being-a-marine/roles-in-the-corps/ground-combat-element/scout-sniper) to
gather intelligence and conduct surgical strikes inside Boko Haram's
Sambisa Forest, Lake Chad, and Mandara Mountain safe havens. It might
even consider investing in a vast array of "spy rocks", [unattended
ground sensors](https://www.wired.com/2012/05/spy-rock/) capable of
covertly monitoring human and vehicle movement in remote areas.

[Washington]{.underline}, for its part, [needs to rethink its military
engagement strategy with Nigeria. It needs to make battalion-level
training and major equipment transfers contingent on tangible efforts by
the Nigerian military to address its human rights deficiencies and make
its security spending more transparent and accountable]{.underline}. At
the same time, the United States should expand the scope and scale of
its lower-level engagement by doing things like tripling Nigerian
participation in the [International Military Education and Training
program](http://www.dsca.mil/programs/international-military-education-training-imet) or
sending U.S. military doctors to spend a year teaching their Nigerian
counterparts about treating battlefield casualties. [Doing so would
demonstrate Washington's lasting commitment to help make Nigeria more
secure without compromising core U.S. principles.]{.underline}

## Bahrain

### Bahrain Violates Human Rights

#### Bahrain human rights is horrible\-\--international complacency is a result of their propaganda

Ahead of the Bahrain Formula One Grand Prix this weekend (Friday 29 to
Sunday 31 March), Amnesty International has highlighted the grim human
rights record of the country.

[Beneath the glamour of the F1, there is a far more **sinister** side to
Bahrain, revealing the country as **a deeply repressive** state where
anyone critical of the government can be jailed **merely** for posting a
tweet]{.underline}

"Beneath the glamour of the F1, there is a far more sinister side to
Bahrain, revealing the country as a deeply repressive state where anyone
critical of the government can be jailed merely for posting a tweet.

[Prominent human rights defenders are under **relentless attack** in the
country]{.underline}

"Prominent human rights defenders are under relentless attack in the
country. Nabeel Rajab was shamefully convicted and sentenced to five
years in prison for tweeting about the conflict in Yemen and torture
allegations in Jaw Prison.

"[Instead of just "sportwashing" its image and glossing over its dismal
human rights record through high speed sport, the Bahraini government
should immediately repeal laws that **criminalize freedom of
expression** and fast track the release of all prisoners of
conscience]{.underline}."

Since mid-2016, the [Bahraini authorities have embarked on a systematic
campaign to **eliminate** organized political opposition in the
country]{.underline}. The [main targets of this **far-reaching
repression** have been human rights defenders, journalists, political
activists, Shi'a clerics and peaceful protesters]{.underline}. Political
[leaders from the majority Shi'a population have been
**disproportionately targeted** througho]{.underline}ut, there [is not
one Shi'a political leader of national stature left who has not been
detained, imprisoned, or stripped of Bahraini nationality.]{.underline}

Earlier this month, Ebrahim Sharif was sentenced to six months in
prison, suspended for three years, for a tweet criticizing Sudanese
President Omar al-Bashir. Sheikh Ali Salman, the leader of al-Wefaq, the
main political opposition group, was sentenced to life in prison for his
views perceived to be critical of the authorities.

[Bahrain has used draconian legislation such as Law No. 58 of 2006 on
the Protection of Society from Terrorist Acts, the Law on Political
Associations, and repressive provisions of the Penal Code including
Articles 134, 160, 165, 168, 214, 215, 216 and 310 to target
protesters]{.underline} and other critics of the government.

Since 2011, [more than 800 people have been stripped of their
nationalities. Of those, 115 lost their citizenship following a
ludicrous mass trial that relied on confessions extracted **under
torture.**]{.underline}

[In the country's notorious Jaw Prison, the lack of medical care is
shocking. In some instances, individuals with serious conditions like
cancer, multiple sclerosis and sickle-cell anemia have been
denied]{.underline} specialist [care]{.underline} and medication.

#### US is aware of Bahrain human rights issues

**Lippman**, 3-28-20**19** (\"An Uncomfortable Alliance: The United
States and Bahrain\", LobeLog, 3-28-2019,
https://lobelog.com/an-uncomfortable-alliance-the-united-states-and-bahrain/)\-\--RKM

Every year in late winter or early spring, the commander of all U.S.
military forces in the Middle East and Central and South Asia delivers
an extensive report to Congress about operations, strategy, planning,
and training across his vast area of responsibility.

And every year [this "Posture Statement" report demonstrates the extent
to which the]{.underline} U.S. Central Command ([CENTCOM) relies on
partnerships with oppressive and dictatorial regimes whose perceived
strategic value overrides concerns about **human rights and political
and religious freedom.**]{.underline}

Saudi Arabia is the best-known example of this uncomfortable reality
among the 20 countries with which CENTCOM has or is seeking some forms
of military cooperation, but hardly the only one. Egypt, which has been
busily cracking down on all forms of dissent, is another, as is
Uzbekistan, where according to Amnesty International, "President Shavkat
Mirziyoyev as taken some steps to improve the country's abysmal human
rights record" but "grave rights violations such as torture, politically
motivated imprisonment, and forced labor in the cotton fields remain
widespread."

[And then there is Bahrain,]{.underline} the tiny island state in the
Persian Gulf [where a monarchy controlled by a small group of Sunni
Muslims keeps a tight grip over a restive, mostly Shiite
population.]{.underline}

So close is its strategic partnership with [the United States that
Bahrain is officially designated a "**major non-NATO ally**," a
distinction that gives it enhanced access to U.S. weapons and
training]{.underline}. [The classification puts Bahrain in the same
legal category as allies such as Australia, Japan, and
Israel]{.underline}. As close as Saudi Arabia has been to the United
States for decades, the kingdom has never been elevated to that status.

At 293 square miles, Bahrain is a dot on the map with fewer than 1.5
million residents, about half of them foreign workers. It is deeply
dependent on Saudi Arabia for economic support and domestic stability.
The Saudis have had troops in the island state since they helped put
down a popular uprising during the Arab Spring unrest of 2011.

Yet, as Gen. Joseph L. Votel noted in his 2019 "Posture Statement,"
"[Bahrain is a strong security partner" for the United States as the
home port of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet and "the only operating U.S.
naval base in the Central Region.]{.underline}" Votel also said that
[Bahrain is fully supportive of U.S. efforts to limit Iranian ambitions
in the Gulf region and "is a strong partner in countering threat
financing,]{.underline} especially helping curtail Iran's efforts to
circumvent financial sanctions."

According to a report issued in February by the Congressional Research
Service:

The [Bahrain government's **repression** has long presented a policy
dilemma for the United States]{.underline} because Bahrain is a longtime
ally that is pivotal to maintaining Persian Gulf security. The country
has hosted a U.S. naval command headquarters for the Gulf region since
1948; the United States and Bahrain have had a formal Defense
Cooperation Agreement since 1991; and Bahrain was designated by the
United States as a "major non-NATO ally" in 1992. There are over 7,000
U.S. forces, mainly Navy, in Bahrain.

[To enlist Bahraini support for his campaign against Iran, the CRS
report said, President Trump lifted some restrictions on arms sales that
the Obama administration had imposed because of Bahrain's
**less-than-stellar human rights record**.]{.underline}

As the CRS report indicated, [the U.S. government as a whole is well
aware of Bahrain's suppression of dissent and systematic discrimination
against its Shia majority.]{.underline} The latest versions of the State
Department's annual report on human rights around the world and of the
department's [Office of International Religious Freedom report contain
**strong criticism** of Bahrain]{.underline}. The Human Rights report
cited "[allegations of torture; arbitrary detention; political
prisoners; arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; restrictions
on freedom of the press" and revocation of the citizenship of
dissidents.]{.underline}

Human rights problems

"On several occasions [government forces used unnecessary and
disproportionate force to disperse protesters]{.underline} ... [the
government used excessive force on February 17 when it used tear gas,
shotguns, batons, sound bombs, and rubber bullets to disperse protesters
from the GCC/Pearl Roundabout.]{.underline} Approximately 1,000 MOI
\[Ministry of Interior\] personnel entered the GCC/Pearl Roundabout at 3
a.m. to disperse camping protesters. Personnel from the BNSA, CID, and
BDF Intelligence were also on site. Security forces fired numerous
rounds of tear gas to disperse protesters and engaged protesters
directly. [The MOI indicated that a number of protesters assaulted
police officers with rocks, sticks, metal rods, swords, knives, and
other sharp object]{.underline}s. As a result, more than 40 officers
sustained injuries, including severe cuts to limbs. [The clearing
operation and subsequent clashes between security personnel and
protesters led to the deaths of four individuals from shotgun wounds and
injuries to 50 protesters]{.underline}. Soon after the police crackdown,
BDF tanks occupied the GCC/Pearl Roundabout to stop demonstrators from
occupying the area. On February 19, security forces withdrew from the
GCC/Pearl Roundabout, allowing demonstrators to retake control of the
area."

"\[In prisons\] [Many reports followed a similar pattern of abuse:
arbitrary arrest, beating without interrogation, beating with
interrogation, harassment and intimidation without further physical
abuse, and then release of the detainee after any visible wounds or
signs of mistreatment had healed]{.underline}."

training]{.underline}. [The classification puts Bahrain in the same
legal category as allies such as Australia, Japan, and
Israel]{.underline}. As close as Saudi Arabia has been to the United
States for decades, the kingdom has never been elevated to that status.

At 293 square miles, Bahrain is a dot on the map with fewer than 1.5
million residents, about half of them foreign workers. It is deeply
dependent on Saudi Arabia for economic support and domestic stability.
The Saudis have had troops in the island state since they helped put
down a popular uprising during the Arab Spring unrest of 2011.

Yet, as Gen. Joseph L. Votel noted in his 2019 "Posture Statement,"
"[Bahrain is a strong security partner" for the United States as the
home port of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet and "the only operating U.S.
naval base in the Central Region.]{.underline}" Votel also said that
[Bahrain is fully supportive of U.S. efforts to limit Iranian ambitions
in the Gulf region and "is a strong partner in countering threat
financing,]{.underline} especially helping curtail Iran's efforts to
circumvent financial sanctions."

According to a report issued in February by the Congressional Research
Service:

The [Bahrain government's **repression** has long presented a policy
dilemma for the United States]{.underline} because Bahrain is a longtime
ally that is pivotal to maintaining Persian Gulf security. The country
has hosted a U.S. naval command headquarters for the Gulf region since
1948; the United States and Bahrain have had a formal Defense
Cooperation Agreement since 1991; and Bahrain was designated by the
United States as a "major non-NATO ally" in 1992. There are over 7,000
U.S. forces, mainly Navy, in Bahrain.

[To enlist Bahraini support for his campaign against Iran, the CRS
report said, President Trump lifted some restrictions on arms sales that
the Obama administration had imposed because of Bahrain's
**less-than-stellar human rights record**.]{.underline}

As the CRS report indicated, [the U.S. government as a whole is well
aware of Bahrain's suppression of dissent and systematic discrimination
against its Shia majority.]{.underline} The latest versions of the State
Department's annual report on human rights around the world and of the
department's [Office of International Religious Freedom report contain
**strong criticism** of Bahrain]{.underline}. The Human Rights report
cited "[allegations of torture; arbitrary detention; political
prisoners; arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; restrictions
on freedom of the press" and revocation of the citizenship of
dissidents.]{.underline}

[The U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified
Congress]{.underline} on Sept. 8 [of nearly \$4 billion in **proposed
foreign military sales** to Bahrain]{.underline}, including 19 F-16V
fighter aircraft and upgrades to 20 other F-16s already in the Bahraini
air force. [The notification marks the official intention
of]{.underline} the [Trump]{.underline} administration [to proceed with
a third major arms sale, each to different countries, that the Obama
administration had held up due to **human rights
concerns**.]{.underline} In May, the administration provided
notification of a sale of precision-guided missiles to Saudi Arabia and
in August proposed selling Super Tucano light aircraft to Nigeria. [Once
notified, Congress has 30 days to review potential sales before the
administration can proceed, but deals are often delayed during a
preceding informal stage when leaders]{.underline} of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee [can vet arms
deals.]{.underline}

On June 26, [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker
(R-Tenn.) said the committee would hold up any further arms sales to
Gulf Cooperation Council countries until there is "a **path to
resolve"** its internal disputes]{.underline}, notably one with Qatar.
Corker indicated [during a Sept. 12 nomination hearing that this would
apply to future sales because the Bahrain deal had **been cleared
previously** during the informal review period.]{.underline} Further,
[Corker said arms sales to Bahrain and human rights should be
**delinked**, and the nominee to become U.S. ambassador to
Bahrain]{.underline}, career diplomat Justin Hicks Siberell, stated that
"[enhancing our security cooperation with Bahrain does not diminish the
enduring emphasis we place on human rights issues."]{.underline}
Siberell added, "[We continue to be concerned with government actions
against **nonviolent** political and human rights actors."]{.underline}

[Though the US is in the process of deepening its already close ties to
the Bahraini security establishment, American officials have clearly
acknowledged its **sectarian policies** and repeatedly expressed concern
over continued **discrimination**]{.underline}. As early as 2011,
current [Secretary of Defense James Mattis]{.underline}, then heading US
Central Command (CENTCOM), reportedly [urged General Daij bin Salman Al
Khalifa]{.underline}, then the BDF's Chief of Staff, [to address the
**sectarianization** of the armed forces, offering lessons learned from
the American military's own history of racial integration.]{.underline}
General Daij, who is now the Secretary-General of the SDC, [Bahrain's
chief defense body, declined Secretary Mattis' offer]{.underline}.103
[The US Government has also publicly urged Bahrain's authorities to
implement BICI recommendation 1722e to "establish urgently, and
implement vigorously, a programme for the **integration** into the
security forces of personnel from all the communities in
Bahrain]{.underline}," [and recommendation]{.underline} 1724c [to
"undertake measures to prevent incitement to **violence**, **hatred**
and **sectarianism** in violation of **human rights**, regardless of
whether the source is public or private."]{.underline}104 During
Bahrain's second UN Universal Periodic Review (UPR) cycle in 2012, [the
US formally recommended that the government increase the diversity of
the security forces so that they become more "reflective of
society]{.underline}." 105 During Bahrain's third cycle in 2017, [the US
reiterated this recommendation]{.underline} in an Advance Question,
[additionally emphasizing the importance of demographic integration at
the leadership level]{.underline}. In both the 2012 and 2017 UPR cycles,
the US also joined dozens of other states in calling for the full
implementation of the entire BICI reform package. [Despite official
Bahraini claims to the contrary,106 the vast majority of these
recommendations have not yet been implemented]{.underline} --
specifically including 1722e and 1724c.

Moreover, [in August 2016]{.underline}, while launching the State
Department's 2016 International Religious Freedom report, Secretary of
State Rex [Tillerson explicitly named Bahrain as a **leading violator of
the right to free belief**, criticizing the government for systematic
and widespread discrimination against the Shia population more
broadly]{.underline}. 107 Specifically, the report confirmed that "t[he
\[Bahraini\] government continued to recruit Sunnis from other countries
to join the security forces, granted them expedited naturalization, and
provided them with public housing while excluding Shia
citizens.]{.underline}"108 Similarly, the US Commission on International
Religious Freedom [(USCIRF) in April raised Bahrain to a Tier 2 violator
of religious freedom for the first time, finding that "amidst an overall
worsening of human rights conditions during the past year, religious
freedom for the majority-Shi'a community deteriorated]{.underline}"
against a backdrop of longstanding structural discrimination, including
in the security apparatus. 109 Current CENTCOM commander General Joseph
Votel also recently called on "the government of Bahrain to reverse
steps it has taken over the past year to reduce the space for peaceful
political expression in its \[Shia\] population and ... \[encourage\]
the Bahrainis to implement needed political reforms in the country."110

However, [despite the fact that Bahrain's authorities have refused to
adhere to either the private exhortations or public recommendations of
the US Government, the Trump administration has removed existing reform
conditions from a pending arms deal with the kingdom's armed forces and
even expanded the range of defense articles on offer.]{.underline} The
US maintains an informal ban on security assistance to the MOI
(excluding the Coast Guard) that could be used against peaceful
demonstrators -- and has cancelled planned anti-terror assistance over
vetting concerns over abusive conduct as recently as 2014 -- [but the
Department of State **authorized** a variety of sales to the BDF in
September 2017, including: two 35-Meter Fast Patrol Boats at an
estimated cost of \$60.25 million; 16-19 F-16V aircraft with support at
an estimated cost of \$2.785 billion; TOW Missiles, equipment and
support at an estimated cost of \$27 million; and the upgrade of F-16
Block 40 Aircraft to F16V configuration at an estimated \$1.082
billion.111]{.underline} In October 2017, the US sent an official
delegation to the Bahrain International Defence Exhibition and
Conference ([BIDEC]{.underline}), [the kingdom's first major arms expo,
contributing warships to the display and authorizing the Navy SEALs to
conduct joint demonstrations with units from the BDF, MOI, National
Guard, Naval Special Forces, and Royal Guard Special Forces -- all
institutions implicated in sectarian discrimination, among other
abuses]{.underline}. The conference, which was [organized by Sheikh
Nasser, the Royal Guard commander accused of **torturing** protesters,
also received **sponsorship from high-profile US companies**, like
Lockheed Martin.]{.underline}

### ! -- Sectarian Conflict / Democracy 

#### Arms sales to Bahrain destabilize the regime, trigger a sectarian conflict and undermine democratic reforms across the region

**Washington Post, 17** (3/13/17, The Washington Post (Online), "Trump
is letting human rights deteriorate, and Bahrain is Exhibit A: The
administration appears willing to go forward with an arms sale despite
Bahrain\'s brazen crackdowns against opponents," Proquest database, JMP)

[IF THERE is an Exhibit A for how]{.underline} the ascent of the
[Trump]{.underline} administration [is leading to the deterioration of
human rights in other countries, it is Bahrain]{.underline} \-- an
island kingdom in the Persian Gulf that is the host of the U.S. 5th
Fleet. [Since 2011, when its majority-Shiite population revolted during
the Arab Spring, **the Sunni monarchy has engaged in serial campaigns of
repression**, interspersed with gestures at liberalization aimed at
appeasing the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates.

In September, [fed up with Bahrain\'s backtracking on the imprisonment
of dissidents and refusal to engage with peaceful opposition
parties]{.underline}, the [Obama]{.underline} administration
[conditioned a \$3 billion sale of 19 F-16 warplanes to the country on a
private list of human rights concessions]{.underline}. They were steps
U.S. officials believed Bahrain could fulfill without risk \-- such as
the release of prominent human rights advocate Nabeel Rajab.

[The regime]{.underline} of King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa [did not
comply. Instead it waited for the results of the U.S. presidential
election. When]{.underline} Donald [Trump won, **it appealed for the
F-16 sale to go forward without conditions \-- and meanwhile launched a
new crackdown on opponents at home**]{.underline}. In the past few
weeks, the government moved to dissolve a moderate, secular opposition
party, restored the power of a domestic intelligence agency to make
arrests, and pushed a measure through parliament authorizing military
trials of civilians.

[Despite these brazen measures \-- the last two of which reverse reform
steps Bahrain previously took in response to U.S. criticism]{.underline}
\-- the [Trump]{.underline} administration [appears to be preparing to
go forward with the F-16 sale]{.underline}. Congressional sources say
they believe that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary
Jim Mattis have agreed to divorce political conditions from military
cooperation with Bahrain and other Persian Gulf allies, and that the
State Department may soon send notification of the F-16s to the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee. That would please Chairman Bob Corker
(R-Tenn.), who has publicly called for the deal to proceed without
conditions.

Other members of the committee, from both parties, remain disturbed by
Bahrain\'s behavior and by the prospect of an unconditional sale.
Ranking Democratic member Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland raised the
issue in a recent phone call with Mr. Tillerson. They are right:
**[The]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[has considerable leverage over the Gulf emirates, and it is wrong not
to use it to check abuses of human rights]{.underline}**. **[The problem
is not just a moral one; the Bahraini regime\'s abuses risk further
destabilizing the country and triggering a sectarian conflict that
nearby Iran could exploit.]{.underline}**

It is difficult for Congress to block an arms sale \-- it must pass a
resolution within 30 days of a formal notification. But Mr. Cardin and
other Foreign Relations Committee members should insist that before
going forward with the Bahrain deal, the administration come up with a
strategy to reverse the ongoing repression. Mr. Rajab and other
nonviolent opponents should be released and peaceful opposition
political parties allowed to organize. **[If]{.underline}** the
**[Trump]{.underline}** administration **[signals toleration for the
crackdown, it will betray liberal reformers across the
region]{.underline}**.

#### Bahrain economy is linked with ME stability\-\--Saudi partnership means economic collapse tanks the region

Reuters in various locations, including Japan, Netherlands, the United
States and United Arab Emirates (Reed, \"Analysis: Bahrain unrest may

DUBAI (Reuters) - [Bahrain may be tiny, and fairly insignificant as an
oil producer, but nearly \$10 billion parked in **mutual funds** in the
kingdom mean plenty is at stake if protests]{.underline} inspired by
Egypt and Tunisia [spiral out of control.]{.underline}

It is [the Gulf Arab state seen as most vulnerable to unrest because of
deep-rooted discontent among its majority Shi'ite population against the
ruling Sunni dynasty]{.underline}, the al-Khalifas. [The populace
complains of economic hardships, lack of political freedoms and
**discrimination in jobs** in favor of Sunnis.]{.underline}

[This has always sat awkwardly with its status as a **regional banking,
trading** and Islamic **finance hub**]{.underline}, [but its
advantages]{.underline}, as a diversified economy and relatively liberal
society, [have outweighed the risks --- **thus far.**]{.underline}

["If you're trying to set yourself as a financial hub you need to
provide security and stability above all else,"]{.underline} said Sven
Richter, managing director and head of frontier markets at Renaissance
Asset Management.

So far there is no sign of money leaving. [The stock market is flat this
week and funds say they are still waiting to see how protests, in which
two people have died this week, play out.]{.underline}

Markets are open and banks are functioning as usual on the island, home
to 1.3 million people, half of whom are foreigners.

[Yet the cost of insuring Bahrain's debt climbed to its highest level
since August 2009 with 5-year credit default swaps rising 13 percent in
two days to 275 basis points.]{.underline}

Investors are watching the situation closely.

[In Saudi Arabia, connected to Bahrain via a causeway, the main share
index **fell 1.2 percent** on Wednesday.]{.underline}

Aqber Naqvi, a fund manager with Al Masah Capital in Dubai, said he
could consider changing his exposure to Bahrain if the unrest grew: "[If
there is traction to these protests, we might take a call," he said.
"But as of now it's too early to say."]{.underline}

SAUDI LINKS

[The financial industry accounts for 25 percent of Bahrain's GDP and is
an important provider of jobs. Assets of Bahraini banks more than
tripled between 2002 and 2008 to \$252 billion]{.underline}, [but have
since **fallen** to \$217 billion]{.underline} as of October 2010.

[The key will be the degree of outflows]{.underline}, if any. With a
currency pegged to the dollar, [Bahrain's \$3.77 billion in foreign
exchange and gold reserves could be quickly depleted.]{.underline}

[Bahrain's **stability is important** for]{.underline} neighbouring
Saudi Arabia, a key supporter of Bahrain's royal family and where key
oilfields are home to an oppressed and occasionally restive Shi'ite
minority. [Bahrain also hosts a major U.S. naval base]{.underline}.

The Shi'ites have long complained of government neglect and
discrimination, well before uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt emboldened
activists across the region. Discontent has been expressed in on-and-off
unrest since the mid-1990s.

[With little oil of its own, Bahrain has little spare cash to throw at
social problems]{.underline}. But it said last week it would spend an
extra \$417 million on social items, including food subsidies.

Protesters want the removal of the prime minister, Sheikh Khalifa bin
Salman al-Khalifa, who has governed since British rule ended in 1971.
For now, they have not sought change at the very top --- his nephew King
Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa has ultimate control over the kingdom.

King Hamad announced last week he would give 1,000 dinars (\$2,650) to
each local family, and the government has indicated that it may free
minors arrested under a security crackdown last year ahead of
parliamentary elections.

"That hasn't seemed to really calm the situation," said Richter at
Renaissance.

POVERTY

The introduction of a new constitution and parliamentary elections a
decade ago helped quell Shi'ite unrest then[. But tensions have risen
again in recent years as Shi'ites have been disappointed with the
assembly's limited clout.]{.underline}

[Shi'ites want their rulers to stop granting Sunnis from outside Bahrain
citizenship and jobs in the armed forces and security
services.]{.underline} They see that as a tactic to change the
demographic balance of the nation.

The government had been planning to cut subsidies to improve its
finances, after posting a 10 percent budget deficit in 2009, and one
factor making spending possible is oil's climb well above Bahrain's
budget break-even price of about \$80 per barrel.

[There is great income disparity in Bahrain]{.underline}, but not to the
degree seen in Egypt. Per capita gross domestic product in Bahrain is
over \$40,000, ranked 20th in the world. But while no Bahraini lives on
less than \$1 a day, an internationally used guide to extreme poverty,
many live on just a few dollars.

[As unrest spread from Tunisia to Egypt, Gulf states were in the
spotlight but mostly seen immune to similar unrest, thanks to an
unwritten pact under which their rulers have traded a share of **their
oil wealth** for their subjects' loyalty.]{.underline}

"Bahrain is on the end of that scale," said Lars Christensen, emerging
markets senior analyst at Danske Bank, referring to Bahrain's lower
level of social stability compared with its Gulf neighbors. "I can't
really see this in Qatar or Kuwait. That's hard for me to imagine."

Neighbouring [Saudi Arabia, Bahrain's biggest trading partner, is
already **watching events closely.**]{.underline}

Both countries are also close U.S. allies --- [Bahrain is home to the
U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, which Washington depends on to curtail the
**regional influence of Shi'ite Iran.**]{.underline}

[Saudi Arabia will **likely step in** to provide aid if Bahrain becomes
unstable. Bahrain is part of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), a loose
economic and political bloc that also includes, the **United Arab
Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Kuwait**.]{.underline}

Christian Shomber, Chief Investment Officer at asset management firm
KMEFIC in Kuwait, said: "[I am confident the GCC has an **interest** in
getting this resolved quickly."]{.underline}

### IL -- Arms Sales =\> Instability / Human Rights Abuses

#### US arms sales are [directly]{.underline} contributing to [Bahrain instability]{.underline}\-\--US arms are being used in domestic fights and human rights abuses

**Vittori**, 2-26-20**19**\-\--Nonresident scholar in the Democracy,
Conflict, and Governance Program(Jodi, \"Bahrain's Fragility and
Security Sector Procurement\", Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace, 2-26-2019,

[Potential instability in Bahrain poses a significant threat to U.S.
**strategic interests**.]{.underline} [The United States gains immensely
from basing rights in Bahrain]{.underline}, which is a key location in
the Persian Gulf with its deepwater port and good airfield access.
Nowhere else in the region provides such useful geography or
facilities.1 [Yet another sudden **uprising** by Bahrainis could
endanger U.S. military personnel and their families living in Bahrain
and could threaten the ability of the United States to keep its
bases.]{.underline}

Aside from relying on the United States for protection, [Bahrain also
**prioritizes its own security sector** as it faces both internal and
external threats.]{.underline} Internally, [the country was roiled by
protests sparked by the Arab Spring in 2011, with smaller-scale protests
continuing to this day. Externally, it considers Iran to be a potential
existential threat, and Bahrain is also taking part in operations
**against Yemeni rebels**.]{.underline}

Especially since restrictions on U.S. arms sales to the country were
lifted by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, [Bahrain
has been on a massive military spending binge]{.underline}: in 2017 and
2018, just the publicly known defense procurement [contracts with the
United States amounted to over \$**6 billion**. That is a tall order for
a country with an overall budget of about **\$10 billion** per
year.]{.underline}

This military procurement splurge is occurring against a backdrop of
long-term Bahraini financial trouble. Bahrain spends much more money
than its oil, financial, and other sectors bring in. It is thus in the
midst of negotiating a five-year, \$10-billion bailout package with its
Arab allies that will include low-interest loans, spending cuts, and a
new value-added tax. The \$10-billion aid package will help the country
plug fiscal holes in the short term, but will not substantially alter
the long-term rent-seeking activity by the country's elites that keeps
Bahrain in dire economic straits.

As Bahraini citizens are being asked to tighten their financial belts
due to the country's economic constraints, there are legitimate
questions of how Bahrain will come up with the money to pay for new
military purchases, as well as what they contribute to the kingdom's
defense.

The answer is that no one outside the Bahraini royal family seems to
know. The Bahraini royal family is not obligated to put many public
accounts---including security sector procurement--- to scrutiny, so
[there is little transparency or accountability to these
purchases]{.underline}. [This breakneck but unaccountable security
sector procurement spending may create pressures on the **legitimacy**
and, ultimately, the **stability** of the Bahraini regime]{.underline}.
[Large purchases of weapons come at the expense of paying for other
items like housing and economic development.]{.underline} [Those same
arms are also often **turned on the population itself**, especially the
politically **marginalized Shia majority**, to repress
dissent]{.underline}. The [lack of transparency and accountability over
the security sector, as well as the repression it metes out, allows the
regime to largely resist both internal and external calls for democratic
reforms.]{.underline} With a population holding significant grievances
with the monarchy and a political economy on shaky ground, large
purchases without clear national security purposes, means to pay for
them, or public accountability only further hurt the legitimacy of the
regime.

This potential for instability has important strategic ramifications for
the United States, given Bahrain's role as a key basing location and
ally in the Persian Gulf. [It is thus in the United States' interest to
strongly encourage the Bahraini royal family to improve its security
sector accountability and transparency]{.underline}, lest the lack
thereof fuels domestic political grievances that may boil over and
jeopardize U.S. objectives in the region.

[Bahrain's monarchy has ruled through a combination of **coercion,
patronage, and sectarianism** while extracting significant rents from
Bahrain's economy]{.underline}. Yet [this extractive and absolutist
regime has fostered discontent among Bahrain's Shia majority and the
population at large]{.underline}. The Bahraini security sector---and in
particular [its unaccountable purchases of security-related equipment
and services---contributes **decisively** to the problem of state
fragility. Given its pivotal role in providing for Bahrain's security
and supplying nearly all its weapons, the United States has
leverage]{.underline}. [It should use that leverage to push the Bahraini
monarchy to reform its security sector procurement
practices.]{.underline} Otherwise, [unchecked security spending and
endemic corruption will threaten to destabilize the Bahraini regime and
imperil U.S. interests.]{.underline}

in Focus, and Mondoweiss (\"Does U.S. Believe Arms Deal With Bahrain
Will Encourage Human Rights?\", Institute for Policy Studies, 2-1-2012,
https://ips-dc.org/does_us_believe_arms_deal_with_bahrain_will_encourage_human_rights/)\-\--RKM

[A US\$53 million arms sale, put on hold in November pending an
investigation by the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry into
Bahraini security forces' **human rights violations**]{.underline}, is
being pushed forward by the Obama Administration [in defiance of
Congressional opposition and **criticism from human rights
observers**]{.underline}. In the meantime, [a new arms sale is going
through, which the US State Department claims has nothing to do with the
original one]{.underline}. The Cable reports that the new deal was going
to be done "without any formal notification to the public," and that the
[State Department told Congress that it has "gone above and beyond what
is legally or customarily required" to address critics' human rights
complaints.]{.underline}

At the same time, [the Kingdom of Bahrain is **denying entry** to
observers from the US-based **Physicians** for Human Rights and **Human
Rights** First organizations, which have been **sharply critical** of
how security forces and the judiciary have behaved towards
demonstrators.]{.underline}

I think the logic behind the Obama Administration's approach works (in
theory) as follows: a trickle of aid coming at the same time the
government is reportedly taking investigators' reports into
consideration will compel the royal family to do more to democratize the
country in exchange for more aid.

If the royal family changes its mind about those observers, I'll start
entertaining more optimistic thoughts about the efficacy of this "behind
the scenes diplomacy." Why? Because [if they were being let in, it would
demonstrate that the US is actually accomplishing a conditional aid
policy that is pushing the government to fully implement the
recommendations in the Commission's report]{.underline}. I often turn to
the concept of "uncivil society" to discuss entrenched interests in
countries experiencing democratic protests, and it's clear [that the US
is going to have to offer tastier carrots, and brandish much heavier
sticks, if it is truly committed to democratization in
Bahrain]{.underline} (and Egypt).

Granted, if these observers' entry became permissible (and it's not an
impossibility), [it could just as easily be read as a decision by the
government to chaperone these people around to mute further
criticism]{.underline} --- something their PR firms back in the US have
already been working very hard at (the Kingdom of Bahrain has retained
the US lobbying group Qorvis for US\$40,000 a month since 2010, with a
particular emphasis on English-language media management).

[Nothing signals "**our priorities**" like using a legal backdoor to
funnel arms to a key Arab ally in the face of **human rights
criticism**]{.underline}, and this holds true along the coastlines of
both American littorals, the Mediterranean and the Gulf. How we respond
to growing pressure on NGOs in Egypt will address the dichotomies facing
Egyptians willing to work with Western NGO. The resumption of arms sales
to Bahrain, alongside the lockout of these groups, offers a much more
concrete lesson of what Bahrainis can expect in the coming months.

#### Bharani [instability is coming now]{.underline}\-\--arms sales [tradeoff]{.underline} with state programs and are used to [squash]{.underline} peaceful reform 

**Vittori**, 2-26-20**19**\-\--Nonresident scholar in the Democracy,
Conflict, and Governance Program(Jodi, \"Bahrain's Fragility and
Security Sector Procurement\", Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace, 2-26-2019,
<https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/02/26/bahrain-s-fragility-and-security-sector-procurement-pub-78443)---RKM>

In the long term, however, [Bahrain's procurement practices are causing
fiscal problems, aggravating societal grievances, and obstructing
reforms that would shore up the monarchy's legitimacy.]{.underline}
First, very high levels of security sector spending and the associated
potential for corruption have imperiled Bahrain's long-term fiscal
stability. It is unclear where Bahrain's regime will get the money for
the purchases---whether from the privy purse, Saudi Arabia, or some
other donor. In addition, neither parliament nor the populace know
whether the country will need to make an immediate one-time payment or
pay in various installments.122 The needed funds will not be coming from
the United States: all U.S. assistance to Bahrain amounted to just a bit
more than \$1 million in 2017.123

Second, [excessive spending on security depletes **funding for social
programs** that could address sectarian and cross-sectarian
grievances.]{.underline} Only [the leftovers from defense spending are
available to provide housing, education, or infrastructure for the
average Bahraini citizen.]{.underline} Within even that paltry
allocation to larger social needs, [Shia then receive the **barest
minimum state resources** required for basic social order.]{.underline}

Third, [arms purchases have been used to **put down protests and
peaceful calls for reform**, thereby preventing democratic and economic
reforms that would enhance the regime's legitimacy]{.underline}. Despite
the repression, the protests continue to pressure the current Bahraini
political settlement. [Bahrain's monarchy has thus backed itself into a
corner: in order to achieve its primary goal of maintaining an absolute
monarchy, it fears opening up even a bit to the needed democratic and
economic reforms that would give the regime greater legitimacy. The
royal family must therefore rely on a combination of coercion,
patronage, and sectarianism.]{.underline} A regime reliant on such a
foundation is threatened if any of those three pillars should fall.
Should the coercive apparatus of the state fail for any reason,
localized demonstrations might swell again, as witnessed in 2011.
Without patronage to key actors, those actors may seek other, better
options.

Sectarianism, in particular, is far from a sturdy pillar for the regime.
Sunni and Shia could overcome the animosity by rallying around
grievances common to both groups. There have been several occasions when
reformists from the two sects have worked together, including in 1996
when both jointly protested the Bahraini government's decision to renege
on promised democratic reforms.124 During the initial days of the 2011
uprisings, the protests were largely nonsectarian, and the General
Federation of Bahrain Trade Unions, the main trade union in the country,
which has both Sunni and Shia members, twice called for general strikes
to protest the use of force against demonstrators.125 The Wa'ad society,
a left-leaning, secular opposition society that was disbanded in May
2017 by the government,126 included both Shia and Sunnis and continued a
long-running trend of cross-sectarian movements that advocate for unity
across religions being especially targeted by the Bahraini security
sector.127 Reformists have overcome sectarian divides to demand
government action and could do so again---it would not be easy, but it
is also not impossible.

Alternatively, if [the regime increases its demonization of Shia,
especially in the armed forces, it could accidentally ignite a
**sectarian conflict** in a country where its co-religionists are the
minority.]{.underline}128 [The regime has been publishing and
distributing hyper-sectarian material to the BDF that encourages
discrimination against non-Sunnis and even labels Shia as heretics who
must repent or be killed.129 One indicator of rising anti-Shia extremism
is that over 100 Bahrainis joined the self-proclaimed **Islamic State**,
including a former police lieutenant from a family close to the
monarchy]{.underline}.130 By relying excessively on sectarianism to
maintain its power, the monarchy, combined with various sectarian
identity entrepreneurs on all sides, could accidentally light the very
spark of an uprising it seeks to avoid.

COERCION, PATRONAGE, AND SECTARIANISM: THE PILLARS OF BAHRAINI REGIME
SURVIVAL

Above all, [the Sunni royal family maintains its power through
**absolute control** over politics. The king, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa,
has the power to appoint all ministers, judges, and one of the two
houses of a **very weak parliament**]{.underline}. He can amend the
constitution at will. His family holds twelve of twenty-six cabinet
posts, including the roles of prime minister, deputy prime ministers,
and ministers of interior, finance, justice, and foreign affairs.4 [Most
political organizations have been **ruled illegal**, nonviolent
opposition leaders are regularly **arrested** or exiled, and the last
relatively free media outlet was **closed** in 2017.]{.underline} The
Bahraini population is not quiescent; [protests have been a near
constant reality over the decades, including widespread demonstrations
that threatened the monarchy's hold on power during the Arab Spring in
2011. However, the regime's practice of **surveilling, arresting, and
punishing** its citizens keeps a lid on larger protests, so small-scale
protests are the norm.]{.underline}

Second, the monarchy selectively distributes patronage from oil rents to
preserve a small but crucial coalition of supporters, particularly
within the security sector. Thus, while Bahrain has a per capita gross
domestic product (GDP) of nearly \$50,000 per year,5 the nation's oil
wealth is highly unequally distributed throughout the population, as is
the case in many other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Many
GCC states, Bahrain included, maintain various overstaffed and
inefficient state agencies to absorb much of the labor force and spend
huge sums on relatively large, well-equipped militaries.6

[By providing targeted patronage to the **security sector**, the
monarchy keeps its ruling coalition as small as possible and protects
the regime from any potential challengers.]{.underline} As scholar
Justin Gengler notes:

Indeed, why waste limited resources chasing citizens opposed to the
status quo when they might be used to reward those who already have a
material stake in its preservation? Rather than deploy limited resources
inefficiently upon the whole of society, rulers of distributive states
such as those of the Gulf generally seek to maximize their own share by
rewarding disproportionately a finite category of citizens whose support
is sufficient to keep them in power, while the remaining population is
comparatively excluded from the private rentier benefits of
citizenship.7

In determining which citizens may be most loyal to the regime and
deciding questions of resource allocation, [the Bahraini regime
deliberately exploits sectarian divisions.]{.underline} The regime's
policy, as described by Gengler, can be described as an "ethnic
subsidy," whereby [a ruler co-opts one's co-ethnics as a relatively
cheap support base that is large enough to ensure regime
survival.]{.underline}8 Thus, [rather than trying to temper sectarianism
in Bahrain, the regime **reinforces** it]{.underline}. The government
uses electoral and legislative rules, plus hiring practices and the
media, to institutionalize sectarian cleavages rather than ameliorate
them. [The regime also moves aggressively against cross-sectarian
political movements and leaders, limiting their ability to unite under
common grievances]{.underline}.

[Using the **politics of fear** so common in authoritarian states, the
monarchy portrays the Shia majority not as an aggrieved group of fellow
Bahraini citizens but as a mob backed by Bahrain's arch enemy, Iran,
that poses an **existential threat** to Bahrain.]{.underline} In a
version of "protection racket politics,"9 [the regime portrays democracy
as **dangerous to the Sunni** minority and stirs up fear that the Shia
majority could vote in an Iranian-style government.]{.underline} The
Bahraini regime can also point to the results of other Arab Spring
revolutions in places like Syria, where civil war and chaos resulted.
The regime can thus win the allegiance of its key supporters by
highlighting that it is better for Sunnis to remain under the security
umbrella of an oppressive state and receive the regime's largesse rather
than risk civil war or subservience under Shia rule.10

Given its reliance on the three pillars of coercion, patronage, and
sectarianism, the Bahraini regime has created three distinct groups.
First is the Sunni monarchy and the inner circle of key supporters,
including elites within the security sector, who receive an outsize
share of the overall rents. Second is the larger Sunni population who
are generally supportive of the regime. Though this group receives a
greater share of rents than Shia, it is still rather poorly compensated
by the regime for its support. Last are [the Shia, who make up the
majority of the country but receive the fewest benefits]{.underline}.11

### IL -- Arms Sales Hurt Economy 

#### Shia majority faces massive [structural inequality]{.underline}\-\--arms sales are fueling economic struggles for local Shia

**Vittori**, 2-26-20**19**\-\--Nonresident scholar in the Democracy,
Conflict, and Governance Program(Jodi, \"Bahrain's Fragility and
Security Sector Procurement\", Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace, 2-26-2019,
<https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/02/26/bahrain-s-fragility-and-security-sector-procurement-pub-78443)---RKM>

[Shia grievances center primarily on their **political and economic
marginalization** under the Bahraini regime, particularly a lack of
voice and representation.]{.underline} [Bahrain's political system has
been designed to exclude the Shia majority, as well as the regime's
opponents more generally.]{.underline} While Bahrain has a parliament,
it is advisory only and its upper house is entirely appointed. Moreover,
severe gerrymandering has been used to ensure the election of supposed
independents who are friendly to the royal family.38 When even that was
not enough, [the Bahraini government made it illegal for anyone in the
opposition to actually run for parliament. Opposition leaders of
peaceful political "societies" (since political parties are illegal) are
regularly imprisoned, stripped of their citizenship, or sent into
exile.]{.underline} The prominent political societies have all been
dissolved by the government.

[Sunni and Shia communities are very segregated]{.underline},39 so
another significant grievance involves the lack of housing and access to
basic public services, with many [Shia villages missing even paved
roads]{.underline}. Furthermore, in [Shia communities, many basic
services are supplied by local charities rather than the
state]{.underline}.40 According to a 2009 poll, [Shia respondents were
much more likely than Sunnis to report difficulty in claiming official
**documents**, enrolling a child in public **school**, receiving medical
**treatment**, or receiving help from the **police** when
needed]{.underline}.41 The ghettoization of many Shia also has a
secondary benefit for the regime: by pushing most Shia into isolated
villages, protest movements are easy to contain in local areas with a
few roadblocks, preventing larger protests from reaching the city
center, as they did in 2011.42

The lack of employment opportunities is also a major grievance. [Shia
are explicitly **forbidden** from working in some sectors, and
informally **barred** from others.43 Anyone seeking a sensitive job
position in the bureaucracy needs a "certificate of good history and
conduct" from the police to show they have never been arrested or
detained, including for political reasons]{.underline}. This discourages
many Shia applicants and restricts many others to only the lower rungs
of state jobs.44 [Shia have many fewer opportunities for public sector
employment than Sunnis with identical employment attributes, while Shia
were likely to be in lower paying, lower prestige jobs than equally
qualified Sunnis.]{.underline}45 A 2003 survey found that Shia held only
18 percent of the 572 high-ranking government posts,46 and in a 2009
survey, all those surveyed who were employed in semi-skilled, unskilled,
or agricultural labor were Shia.47

[One of the job sectors largely unavailable to Shia is the **security
sector.**]{.underline}48 [A leaked March 2009 confidential list of over
1,000 employees in Bahrain's security sector showed that only **4
percent of employees were Shia** while 64 percent were "non
citizens]{.underline}, most of Asian nationalities." [The aforementioned
2009 survey did not find a single Shia who worked for the police or
armed forces]{.underline}, despite the fact that the security sector is
one of the largest employers on the island.49 The Ministry of Interior
is believed to employ the most Shia of any security agency, yet even
here the personnel is only estimated to be about 10 percent Shia.50

Furthermore, the Bahraini regime has stocked the lower ranks of the
security sector with non-Bahrainis.51 As early as 1998, a Financial
Times article reported that 8,000 to 10,000 Sunnis and their families
had been brought from Jordan, Pakistan, Syria, and Yemen into the
Bahraini security sector,52 and they continue to be the most common
groups, along with a smattering of British in senior positions. [In
2011, a pro-government media outlet reported that about 40 percent of
the Ministry of Interior was composed of foreign nationals.53 In
addition, the National Guard and police force are thought to be
primarily staffed by foreigners]{.underline}, especially Pakistanis and
Yemenis. In 2009, the Bahrain Center for Human Rights reported that
almost two-thirds of the National Security Agency's personnel were
non-Bahraini.54 [Shia are also concerned that foreign Sunnis are being
brought in to change the sectarian makeup of Bahrain.]{.underline} In a
country of less than 1.4 million people, it does not take many new
immigrants to change the sectarian balance, especially when Shia hold
only a slight majority of the country.55

[Grievances over the security services were a major motivator in the
2011 uprisings, and thus were a central aspect of the reforms promised
by the monarchy in 2012.]{.underline} These reforms quickly stalled,
however, in part because the [exclusion of Shia from the security sector
is fundamental to the Bahraini regime's **strategy of
survival**.]{.underline}56 According to a leaked 2006 U.S. diplomatic
cable, "The King noted that many Shia complain that there are no Shia in
the military leadership of the country. This is a question of loyalty,
he stated. As long as \[Iranian Supreme Leader\] Khamenei has the title
of Commander-in-Chief, Bahrain must worry about the loyalty of Shia who
maintain ties and allegiance to Iran."57

[Shia exclusion from the security sector exacerbates discontent with the
Bahraini state overall in three ways.]{.underline} First, it ensures
Sunnis, especially the royal family, maintain control over the organs of
power, despite being a minority of the population. Second, [the Bahraini
security sector is a major employer in the country, and exclusion from
that sector means fewer good, middle-class jobs for Shia]{.underline}.
And third, with an enlisted force largely made up of noncitizens, and
very recently naturalized citizens, who speak little or no Arabic and
have no social ties to the areas they patrol, [the Bahraini security
sector leadership can better oppress civilians where locals might
balk]{.underline}. Locals blamed non-Bahraini security members for much
of the violence during the Arab Spring protests.58

[Even while the administration campaigns against Assad it **continues to
back** Bahrain's autocracy]{.underline} and the latter's chief
autocratic sponsor, Saudi Arabia. In typical even-handed fashion,
[American officials have called for restraint on both sides---Bahrainis
demonstrating for democracy and Bahrainis shooting those demonstrating
for democracy.]{.underline}

No doubt, the situation in Syria is worse than that in Bahrain. And no
amount of hypocrisy in Washington can justify the conduct of Damascus.
Nevertheless, the [Obama administration's discreditable behavior **makes
a mockery** of the American government's alleged commitment to
**democracy** and **human rights.**]{.underline}

Bahrain, like most of the other Gulf States, is essentially a royal
dictatorship. [A Sunni royalty manipulates the system to advantage the
minority Sunni population.]{.underline} [The Shia population is
disadvantaged and oppressed]{.underline}. Last year the Shiites rose up,
only to face ruthless repression by Manama's rulers, who employed the
full power of the state. [Peaceful demonstrators were attacked. Scores
were killed. Many were arrested, **even doctors** caring for wounded
protestors]{.underline}. The Bahrain Youth Society documented scores of
deaths and beatings of demonstrators over the last year. [An independent
human rights review revealed torture to be a "**systematic
policy."**]{.underline}

[According to the State Department's latest human rights assessment of
Bahrain: "egregious human rights problems reported in 2011]{.underline}
included the inability of citizens to peacefully change their
government; the dismissal and [expulsion of workers and
students]{.underline} for engaging in political activities; the
[arbitrary arrest]{.underline} and detention of thousands, including
medical personnel, human rights activists, and political figures,
sometimes leading to their [torture and/or death in
detention]{.underline}; [and the lack of due process."]{.underline}

That's not all. The State Department added: "[Other significant human
rights concerns included arbitrary deprivation of life; detention of
prisoners of conscience; reported violations of privacy and restrictions
on civil liberties]{.underline}, including [freedoms of speech, press,
assembly, association, and some religious practices]{.underline}. In
some instances the government imposed and enforced travel bans on
political activists." When it comes to religion, explained State, "the
Sunni Muslim citizen population enjoyed favored status, and the Shia
population faced discrimination." And on State went.

Nor did Bahrain's Shia residents face only Bahraini oppression. [The
regime naturally blamed local unrest on Iran, without producing any
evidence ofTehran's involvement.]{.underline} However, other Gulf
nations, led by Saudi Arabia, sent troops to bolster Bahrain's royals.
[The House of Saud is both family kleptocracy and Sunni]{.underline}
dictatorship. Riyadh certainly is no friend of human liberty. Noted the
latest State Department human rights report: "[problems reported
included citizens' lack of the right and legal means to change their
governmen]{.underline}t; pervasive restrictions on universal rights such
as freedom of expression, including on the Internet, and freedom of
assembly, association, movement, and religion; and a lack of equal
rights for women and children, as well as for workers."

[Other issues included "torture and other abuses, poor prison and
detention center conditions, holding political prisoners and detainees,
denial of due process and arbitrary arrest and detention, and arbitrary
interference with privacy, home, and correspondence]{.underline}." Given
the controls over personal lives, including religious practice, [the
system is essentially **totalitarian**]{.underline}. The U.S. went to
war with Iraq while allied with Saudi Arabia, but a Christian woman
would have been far better off living in Baghdad than Riyadh.

[The Saudi royals know they live the good life and are prepared to shed
**as much blood as necessary** to preserve their system.]{.underline}
That means stifling the incubus of Shia revolt in next-door Bahrain.
Indeed, Riyadh has proposed a quasi-union with its small neighbors,
which naturally horrifies Bahrain's Shiites. Not that Saudi brutality
bothers American presidents, who have routinely feted rulers from the
House of Saud. Indeed, rarely has the word "democracy" passed the lips
of an American diplomat in the presence of a Saudi prince.

Admittedly, [Washington was **embarrassed** by the protests in Bahrain.
It tut-tutted about the brutal suppression of democracy protests and
said the al-Khalifa royal family should be nicer to the people it was
mulcting]{.underline}. Most recently the Obama administration professed
itself to be "deeply disappointed" by a Bahraini decision to uphold the
earlier conviction of medical personnel for treating protestors: "These
convictions appear to be based, at least in part, on the defendants'
criticisms of government actions and policies." Who would have imagined?

[But Bahrain's King Hamad recently threatened the opposition for
"insulting" the army, which is the regime's **primary too**l of
repression.]{.underline} He announced that "the executive agencies must
take the necessary legal measures to deter these violations." Which,
based on past behavior, presumably means arrest, torture, and
imprisonment, if not death, for violators. Still, Washington wants to be
even-handed. Earlier this month State Department spokeswoman Victoria
Nuland said: "We urge all sides to work together to end the violence and
refrain from incitement of any kind." If only the Shia would stop
criticizing the oppressors they might not get shot.

The administration's dilemma is obvious. [The U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet is
based in Manama. And the U.S. doesn't want a little thing like some
state-sponsored human rights violations to get in the way of an
otherwise beautiful friendship.]{.underline}

However, [the U.S. doesn't stop with acquiescing to the Bahraini royals
and their plundering and torturing. Washington is **actively
strengthening** the regime]{.underline}. [Last year the Obama
administration reluctantly held up in **arms sales** under congressional
pressure]{.underline}. Now Washington is releasing [\$**53 million** in
"previously notified equipment needed for Bahrain's external defense and
support of 5th Fleet operations."]{.underline} Other security assistance
will remain on hold, at least for now."Bahrain is an important security
partner and ally in a region facing enormous challenges," explained
Nuland.

[**No matter how the administration attempts to spin its decision, it is
seen as an affirmation of the al-Khalafi dictatorship.**"You really
should be nicer to the people you are oppressing; oh, by the way, **here
are the weapons you were expecting**]{.underline}" is what Manama will
hear from Washington. Complained Mohammed al-Maskati, a Bahraini human
rights activist: **["It's a direct message that we support the
authorities and we don't support democracy in Bahrain, we don't support
protestors in Bahrain."]{.underline}**

The administration recognizes how its action looks. One unnamed U.S.
official told the Christian Science Monitor: ["We've made this decision
mindful of the fact that there remain a number of serious unresolved
human rights issues in Bahrain which we expect the government of Bahrain
to address." No doubt, after **filling his armory** the king will rush
to oblige!]{.underline}

Tom Malinowski, Washington director for Human Rights Watch, credited
Washington with advocating political reform, but argued ["the number one
U.S. security interest in Bahrain right now is not making sure they have
slightly better F-16 engines, it's **making sure that they implement the
reforms needed** to make the relationship sustainable over the
long-term."]{.underline}

#### Arms sales deck American credibility in the region\-\--arms to Bahrain are being used against protesters

**Lobe**, 6-29-20**11** (\"BAHRAIN: U.S. Congress Urged to Reject Arms

WASHINGTON, Sep 29 2011 (IPS) - [More than a dozen U.S. and
**international human rights** and arms control groups are urging
Congress to block a proposed 53- million-dollar arms sale to
Bahrain]{.underline}, which hosts the U.S. Fifth Fleet, [until it ends
its crackdown against the opposition and adopts serious
reforms.]{.underline}

[In a letter sent to lawmakers]{.underline} Wednesday, the
[groups]{.underline}, which include Human Rights First (HRF), Human
Rights Watch (HRW), and the Open Society Policy Centre, [said Washington
risked losing more credibility, particularly in the Arab world, as a
force for freedom if it went through with the sale.]{.underline}

["This prioritisation of security interests over political reform stands
in stark contrast to]{.underline} President (Barack) [Obama's
declaration of support]{.underline} in May [to those protesting for
freedom throughout the region, when he said: 'If you take the risks that
reform entails, you will have the full support of the United
States,\'"]{.underline} according to the letter.

"The people Bahrain have taken those risks for reform," the letter
added, noting that protests in the tiny kingdom last February "were the
largest of the Arab Spring ...(r)elative to the country's size."

The letter's release coincided with Thursday's sentencing by a Bahraini
military court of 20 doctors and other health professionals who treated
injured protestors during the pro-democracy protests that erupted
against the government of King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa earlier this
year.

The defendants, who were charged with stealing medicine, stockpiling
weapons, inciting hatred against the government and occupying Manama's
Salamaniya Medical Complex, face between five and 15 years in prison.

Those sentences, as well as the affirmation by a special security court
Wednesday of life sentences for eight prominent Shiite political figures
who helped lead the protests, will almost certainly add to sectarian
tensions in Bahrain and intensify the debate within both the
administration and Congress here about how best to press the royal
family, who are Sunni Muslims, toward a more conciliatory stance
vis-à-vis majority Shi'a population.

"We're deeply disturbed by the severity of the sentences handed down
today," a State Department spokesperson told IPS regarding the
sentencing of the health professionals, a number of whom reportedly
confessed under torture.

"We've raised our concerns at the highest levels of the Bahraini
government regarding Bahrain's use of military courts to try civilians,
and we continue to urge it to abide by its commitment to transparent
judicial proceedings and due process conducted in full accordance with
Bahraini law and its international legal obligations," he added.

"We call on the government of Bahrain to create a climate conducive to
national reconciliation, meaningful dialogue, and reform that ... brings
peaceful change that is responsive to the aspirations of all Bahrainis."

In relation to the arms transfer, he also said, ["We have closely
monitored the internal security situation in Bahrain since the civil
unrest that occurred earlier this year, and we continually examine all
relevant information to fulfil our obligations under the Leahy
law."]{.underline}

[The Leahy law forbids the transfer of any military aid or equipment to
military or security units that are credibly reported have committed
human rights abuses.]{.underline}

Thursday's sentences were also condemned by a host of human rights
groups here. Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), which also signed the
letter to Congress, called the sentences "unconscionable", while Amnesty
International assailed the original guilty verdicts and prison sentences
against the medical personnel, insisting that the charges against them
were "ludicrous".

[Although]{.underline} the [Obama]{.underline} administration [initially
denounced the Bahraini government's crackdown against the pro-democracy
movement]{.underline} when it first broke out last February, [Washington
has been relatively quiet since mid-March when it objected publicly to
the dispatch of some 1,500 troops]{.underline} and police from Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to Bahrain in support of the regime.

[Washington's reticence has been attributed primarily to its
**geostrategic interests**; specifically, the continued use and planned
expansion of its naval base in Bahrain]{.underline}, and its desire to
avoid further straining ties with Riyadh.

Already angry over what it regarded as Obama's abandonment of Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, Saudi Arabia was further aggravated by
Washington's initial support for the opposition's demands for democratic
reform.

Such reform, in Riyadh's view, risked empowering Bahrain's Shi'a
majority which, in turn, could spur similar protests among the Shi'a
population in Saudi Arabia's oil-rich Eastern Province and strengthen
Iran's influence and position in the Gulf.

At the same time, U.S. officials have been worried that Manama's
repression would radicalise the Shi'a population, which is believed to
make up about 70 percent of the kingdom's citizenry, and drive it closer
to Iran

For most of the past year, Washington quietly tried to promote the
position of Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, who is
regarded as a reformist. But he has been "effectively sidelined" by the
king's hard-line uncle, Prime Minister Khalifa ibn Sulman al- Khalifa,
according to a recent paper by Gulf expert Thomas Lippman. Backed by
Riyadh, the prime minister has held his post since Bahrain's
independence from Britain in 1971.

Under his leadership, the repression has been sustained. [More than 40
people have been killed, most of them in the first weeks of the
demonstrations. More than 1,600 people have been arrested and many of
them have been abused or tortured while in custody, according to local
and international human rights monitors]{.underline}.

Moreover, the authorities have carried out what the letter to Congress
called "a large-scale campaign of retribution against anyone supporting
or participating in protests, including arrests and detentions of
internationally respected human rights activists, medical
professionals... journalists and bloggers reporting on protests, and
union activists and other workers calling for a boycott to address
grievances in the workplace."

More than 2,500 people have been fired from their jobs, and more than 40
Shi'a mosques and religious sites have been destroyed in raids that have
also targeted Shi'a neighbourhoods and villages.

[Nonetheless, the administration notified Congress two weeks ago that it
intends to sell 53 million dollars worth of military equipment to
Bahrain, mostly armoured Humvees, which could conceivably be used by the
kingdom's security forces against protestors, and anti-tank
missiles.]{.underline}

In its notification, the Pentagon asserted that the sale "will
contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United
States by helping to improve the security of a major non-NATO ally that
has been, and continues to be, an important force for political
stability and economic progress in the Middle East."

Under the law, Congress can block the sale by passing a joint resolution
of disapproval, a procedure that has very rarely been invoked.

In the letter, the groups, which also included the Project on Middle
East Democracy (POMED), the Norwegian Forum for Environment and
Development, and the Friends Committee on National Legislation (FCNL),
urged lawmakers to "request a formal briefing from the Department of
State on how this sale will affect the process of political reform and
accountability for serious human rights violations in Bahrain, and how
(it) will affect public sentiment toward the United States and its
presence in Bahrain."

In his report, which was published this week by POMED, Lippman called
for the administration to send a high-level official to Bahrain "in the
coming weeks" to publicly express the administration's concern about
ongoing human rights abuses.

He also suggested that the Pentagon "explore and develop alternative
locations for Fifth Fleet headquarters, and let the Bahraini government
know, discreetly, that this activity is taking place."

Since the release of the BICI report in 2011, [human rights violations
and the culture of impunity have continued largely unabated in
Bahrain]{.underline}. Protests remain a near daily occurrence. [Critics
of the government face relentless harassment and arrest, and reports of
**torture, ill-treatment, sexual assault, and death** in detention
persist]{.underline}. Freedoms of association, expression and assembly
were further restricted through legislation passed by the National
Assembly in August 2013, and the authorities have increasingly wielded
specialized laws -- like the cybercrime and anti-terror laws -- to
suppress activism. [The Bahraini government continues to utilize
**sectarian language** to describe the protests and distort the
country's political crisis, though the grievances aired by those
protesting affect all Bahrainis.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, [Bahraini **security forces** weaponize and indiscriminately
use "non-lethal weapons" such as tear gas and birdshot against peaceful
protesters]{.underline}, leading to the death of more than 30
individuals and sparking international complaints about the government's
disproportionate crackdown. In May 2017, five demonstrators were killed
when the authorities violently raided a peaceful sit-in in Diraz,
marking the kingdom's deadliest day since before the 2011 uprising.

Although the Government of Bahrain established an Office of Ombudsman to
investigate claims of mistreatment by government officials and security
forces, [not a single senior official has been held accountable for
human rights violations.]{.underline} Rather, since the Office's
establishment, there has been an increase in arbitrary arrests and
politically motivated charges including a recommended 5-year jail
sentence for 'insulting the King', while government officials accused of
mistreatment and torture continue to be acquitted at alarming rates.
[Other bodies meant to monitor human rights abuses like the National
Institution for Human Rights (NIHR) have so far similarly failed to
uphold international standards and drive reform in Bahrain]{.underline}
-- in January 2017, the [NIHR actually commended the government for
ending a de facto moratorium on the death penalty and executing three
victims of torture after a trial rife with due process
violations.]{.underline}

On November 22 2014, the Government of Bahrain held parliamentary and
municipal elections, the first since the beginning of political unrest
in 2011. While the government heralded these polls as the culmination of
Bahrain's reform efforts, a broad coalition of opposition societies
chose to boycott them. Since then, these societies have faced relentless
judicial harassment by the authorities, culminating in the outright
dissolution of the two largest groups Al-Wefaq and Wa'ad in 2016 and
2017, respectively. [Ahead of the next round of parliamentary elections
set for 2018, the government has effectively **dismantled** the formal
opposition.]{.underline}

As a longtime security partner, [the United States Government is
**uniquely positioned** to influence the state of human rights and
democratic reform in Bahrain: both countries share a **mutual interest**
in maintaining the presence of the US Fifth Fleet in Manama and overall
**regional stability**.]{.underline} Yet, [if the Government of Bahrain
continues to choose repression over reform -- undermining independent
civil society and peaceful political opposition -- the kingdom will
remain at **severe risk of conflict and instability**.]{.underline} The
[American Government must ensure that **human rights are at the center**
of the US-Bahrain bilateral relationship and support the democratic
aspirations of the Bahraini people]{.underline}, recognizing that
security and reform are symbiotic rather than competing objectives. It
is imperative that [US policymakers use all points of leverage in order
to move the Bahraini government toward a true path of reform and
reconciliation before the crisis escalates even further.]{.underline}

[Policy Recommendations]{.underline}

It is clear that [existing policies have neither compelled the
Government of Bahrain to honor its stated commitments to reform nor
contributed to improving the deteriorating political situation that
threatens both Bahrain's stability and international security interests
in the Gulf region.]{.underline} ADHRB [presents the following policy
recommendations in order to more effectively promote fundamental human
rights and political freedoms in the country while simultaneously
**advancing America's broader strategic goals**:]{.underline}

[United States Congressional and Executive Branch
Recommendations]{.underline}

Sustained high-level public as well as private calls on the Government
of Bahrain to adhere to its human rights commitments and enact
meaningful reforms. Such reforms include the release of all political
prisoners and accountability for torture and other serious human rights
crimes, along with the full implementation of the remaining BICI and UPR
recommendations.

Ensure clear and consistent messaging from all levels of the U.S.
Government encouraging the Government of Bahrain to adhere to its human
rights commitments, including through accountability for torture and
other serious human rights abuses and the release of all political
prisoners.

[Ensure full compliance with the intent of the "**Leahy Law**" to avoid
U.S. **complicity** with human rights violations]{.underline}. As a
first step, [the U.S. **should suspend arms sales** and security
assistance to the Government of Bahrain until the U.S. Government
determines **which Bahraini security force units are ineligible** for
transfers and can verify that **U.S.-origin weapons are not enabling**
human rights abuses in Bahrain.]{.underline}

Support the establishment of an independent international monitoring
mechanism to oversee the implementation of the BICI recommendations and
other reforms that the Government of Bahrain has committed to enacting.

Prioritize human rights and democracy promotion funding for Bahrain,
including through the Democracy Fun and the Middle East Partnership
Initiative.

### S -- Conditioning Arms Sales

#### Conditioning arms solves\-\--forces Bahrain to embrace Human Rights

**ADHRB**, 11-28-20**17**\-\-- (\"Sectarian Discrimination and Extremism
in Bahrain's Security Forces Questions for US Policy\", Americans for
Democracy and Human Rights in Bahrain,11-28-2017,
https://www.adhrb.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.Sectarianization-of-Security-Forces_White-Paper.pdf)\-\--RKM

[Amidst these **sales** and **cooperative** initiatives, the Bahraini
security forces have implemented no new reforms, and have instead
**taken new discriminatory and abusive measures**]{.underline}. In fact,
since the election of President Donald Trump, Bahrain has seen a
dramatic uptick in both institutional and extemporaneous lethal violence
employed by the Bahraini security forces: just in 2017, among other
abuses, the authorities ended a de facto moratorium on capital
punishment by executing three men tortured into providing false
confessions; amended the constitution to allow military courts to try
civilians; restored domestic arrest powers to the NSA after this
authority was revoked in accordance with BICI recommendation 1718; and
launched two deadly raids on a peaceful sit-in in the town of Diraz,
ultimately killing six demonstrators and injuring hundreds.113 The
second raid, on 23 May 2017, came just days after President Trump met
with Bahrain's king and assured him that there would be no "strain" in
the US-Bahrain bilateral relationship.114 It was the bloodiest single
security operation in Bahrain since before 2011.

[As demonstrated by the persistent deterioration of Bahrain's human
rights situation**, deepening unconditional assistance** to the security
establishment will only embolden **further discrimination and
abuse**]{.underline}. [The US must instead reaffirm its commitment to
creating strong, sustainable national armed services that are force for
long-term stability and reconciliation in Bahrain, not a source of a
division and extremism. As currently constituted, however, Bahrain's
security forces remain sectarian institutions that directly undermine
American objectives to establish sustainable security frameworks in the
Gulf, combat terrorism, and advance democracy and human
rights]{.underline}. Existing US security policy toward the kingdom
fails to address these concerns, and risks directly arming and abetting
sectarian extremism and repression.

[We therefore call on the US Government to take the following steps to
reduce these risks and encourage positive security sector reform in
Bahrain.]{.underline}

To the administration: • [Impose new **human rights and reform
conditions** on any future arms transfers to Bahraini security
institutions with specific, measureable, and public criteria, including
programs for demographic integration and the elimination of extremist
and/or sectarian training materials]{.underline}. • [Vet thoroughly all
Bahraini security units to verify eligibility for US assistance and to
ensure full compliance with the intent of **the Leahy Law** and other
**end-use monitoring requirements** to prevent American material from
being utilized in the commission of human rights
violations.]{.underline} • Publicly raise concerns over sectarian
discrimination within the Bahraini security forces and launch a
multi-agency review of any training or instruction materials produced
by, or disseminated within, units receiving arms and assistance from the
US. • Take steps to incorporate demographic integration support into
Bahrain-US defense sector collaboration, modeled off of Secretary
Mattis' proposal to mirror racial integration programs implemented by
the US military.

To Congress: • [Vote to hold the current set of arms sales intended for
Bahraini military until it meets the previous set **of reform
conditions** removed by the administration, or an updated set of
conditions agreed upon Congress]{.underline}. • [Legislate a ban on
additional weapons transfers to Bahrain until it implements all 26
recommendations of the BICI]{.underline}. • [Request a report by the
Department of State and/or the Department of Defense based on an
official review of sectarian discrimination and extremist materials
produced by, or disseminated within, the units of the BDF receiving arms
and assistance from the US, as well as the broader Bahraini security
establishment.]{.underline}

### S -- U.S. Leverage

#### Using [U.S. arms leverage]{.underline} solves\-\--it sends a [credible]{.underline} message to Bahrain and promotes [reform]{.underline} 

**Vittori**, 2-26-20**19**\-\--Nonresident scholar in the Democracy,
Conflict, and Governance Program(Jodi, \"Bahrain's Fragility and
Security Sector Procurement\", Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace, 2-26-2019,
<https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/02/26/bahrain-s-fragility-and-security-sector-procurement-pub-78443)---RKM>

Under the Obama administration, [the United States made some **limited**
steps to check the Bahraini regime's authoritarianism.]{.underline} His
administration withheld some arms purchases from Bahrain following the
2011 uprisings and publicly chastised the Bahraini regime in 2016,
[though no sanctions were imposed on any Bahraini officials nor was
military cooperation interrupted]{.underline}. Since 2012, the United
States had an administrative hold on providing weapons to the Ministry
of Interior, though that hold did not apply to the Coast Guard or to the
military, nor did it affect U.S. training for the MOI.[131 In 2017, the
Trump administration **dropped human rights conditions** for arms sales,
though some restrictions remain on weapons that can be used for crowd
control]{.underline}.132

[The United States and other **Western powers have tremendous leverage**
over Bahrain, which receives almost all its **weapons** from the United
States and relies on its more powerful security partners to defend it
from a major attack by Iran]{.underline}. [The United States can
mitigate its strategic risks by **using that leverage** to nudge the
monarchy toward greater reform before it is too late.]{.underline}
Security sector procurement reform will encounter fierce resistance from
the monarchy as well as from its local patron, Saudi Arabia. But [slow,
painful reforms now can help lessen the chances of popular unrest and
political instability in Bahrain, which would be highly detrimental to
U.S. interests in the region]{.underline}.

For decades, Western governments have usually focused on efforts to
integrate the Shia into the security sector as a means of enhancing the
Bahraini government's legitimacy. This is a noble goal that Western
countries should continue to pursue. Fixing this problem, however, is a
long-term task: even if Shia were recruited into the security services
today, it would be a decade until they made it to mid-level ranks. And
many Shia may not even apply given the poor opinion they hold of the
regime and the likelihood of being seen as traitors by their own
communities. Efforts to foster Shia integration will also be wrenching
for society and have encountered resistance from the Bahraini monarchy.

In the meantime, [working on procurement issues is a less controversial
place to start]{.underline}, and the results can be seen more quickly
without as much social turmoil. In order to build the legitimacy of the
Bahraini monarchy and make it more accountable to the population in a
shorter timeframe, [Western governments should use their leverage to
influence the Bahraini monarchy to improve security sector procurement
**transparency and accountability**]{.underline}. [Procurement reform is
a less controversial and more advantageous place for larger government
reforms for several reasons.]{.underline}

First, [issues of transparency and accountability, as well as security
sector abuses, already crosscut most of Bahraini society.]{.underline}
[Focusing on common ground can build more trust between Sunni and Shia
communities.]{.underline} Bahraini society has already shown a clear
concern for procurement: on social media, [Bahrainis raise doubts about
large military purchases, especially about where the country will get
the money, and parliamentarians have tried to raise such questions as
well]{.underline}.133

Second, the procurement sector is so large that even limited reforms
would go a long way toward fixing Bahrain's fiscal imbalances and
freeing up resources for social programs. In 2012, the Bahraini
parliament tried to formulate a strategy to handle the budget deficit
and the country's debt, and it highlighted that military spending was
reducing the resources available for spending on health and
education.134 Yet without the basic facts and figures of security sector
procurement, parliament cannot hope to balance the overall budget.135

Third, procurement reform would be an important start in addressing
larger civil-military relations issues by gradually bringing the
security sector under a level of civilian, nonmonarchical control

[The first efforts should focus on influencing Bahrain to publish a
national security strategy]{.underline}. The strategy should be
unclassified, though there may be a need for some classified annexes.
With that strategy in hand, Bahraini citizens and [Western powers can
better evaluate how Bahraini security sector procurement contracts are
or **should** be aligned with Bahrain's national security
goals]{.underline}, as well as U.S. interests such as containing Iran
and fighting terrorism. This step can help ensure that Bahrain's budget
is more rationally spent, [ideally **leaving more money** for economic
and social development projects.]{.underline}

Second, given how Western defense contracts can be abused to bolster the
Bahraini regime's coercive apparatus, [Western governments should insist
on **extra scrutiny** of all contracts associated with
Bahrain.]{.underline} Governments should mandate that all [contracts
associated with the Bahraini state be published to improve transparency
and accountability]{.underline}. Any U.S.-associated contracts or
contract licenses that cannot be made public due to national security
concerns should have to be reported to Congress, along with the national
security justification. [Offset contracts should be forbidden, and the
beneficial owners of all subcontractors, agents, and other
intermediaries should be made publicly known.]{.underline} All
[contracts should include corruption clauses]{.underline} to make
contract termination easier should malfeasance be discovered, thereby
incentivizing better contract delivery.

Third, Western countries should encourage Bahrain to develop a timeline
and action plan for adherence to international contracting standards
like the Open Contracting Partnership standards, including their data
standards. These standards lay out best practices for the entire
contracting process, from contract tenders to eventual contract
completion. Some contracts will need to be classified, but those
contracts should be the exceptions, not the rule. Which contracts will
remain secret should be explicitly spelled out to the public and
approved by parliament. Parliamentary committees should be established
with clearances and the legislative authority to be briefed on and
approve secret security contracts, just as is done in the United States.
The timelines involved must be enforced with credible sanctions for
noncompliance.

Signing up to such standards would signal to key actors within Bahrain
that this particular form of patronage would be ending. [The Bahraini
government would build legitimacy, as the public could better see that
Bahraini security spending is more accountable]{.underline}. And public
tendering and fewer secret contracts could [improve the Bahraini
economy, as smaller contractors could compete on price and quality
rather than on connections, helping to bring in new economic actors and
bolstering existing, smaller ones.]{.underline}

Eventually, along with better contracting, the government should be
required to submit audited statements of security sector procurement,
with an eye to ultimately putting the entire government budget to public
audits, with limited, specified exceptions for national security
concerns. Bahrain already has a National Audit Court that produces a
professional and detailed annual public report on financial and
administrative activities and irregularities. Unfortunately, it does not
cover all government revenues, nor can it report on royal court
expenditures, much of the security sector, or the sovereign wealth
fund.136 Various scandals, like the aforementioned land scandals,
indicate it is not capturing all spending either.

However, the example of Bahrain's GCC ally, Kuwait, demonstrates that
auditing Bahrain's expenditures is feasible. Kuwait has a relatively
open and transparent system of publicly available audited accounts.
While some money may not be accounted for, the declared value of oil and
gas exports compared to oil and gas revenues showed deviations that were
within typical international norms, indicating that much less of the
country's revenue was being illicitly siphoned off.137

Given that security procurement is a key component of the regime's
survival strategy, [the monarchy will fight back with threats to revoke
Western basing rights or to buy weapons from other suppliers, especially
Russia and China.]{.underline} There is precedent for this: when
Congress froze a sale of small arms to Bahrain in 2011, Bahrain bought
the small arms elsewhere.138 When the United States froze sales of
Humvees that same year, Bahrain purchased Turkish-made Cobra armored
personnel carriers instead (though in September 2017, Bahrain announced
it was purchasing U.S. Humvees again).139 Bahrain also publicly stated
that it would buy Russian S-400 missiles, though no details of the
purchase were offered.140 [Bahrain should be reminded that such
purchases would endanger the U.S. security umbrella overall and
jeopardize Western military aircraft operations there. Bahrain, as well
as its patron Saudi Arabia, recognize that they need the U.S. bases in
Bahrain at least **as much** as the United States does]{.underline}, and
the United States should be willing to use that leverage to push for
security procurement-related reforms. [Using its leverage over
procurement should be coupled with other leverage, such as limiting high
level engagement, additional audits of prior weapons deliveries, and
heightened congressional scrutiny of purchases to further pressure
Bahrain.]{.underline}

At the same time, the United States should explore viable alternatives
to basing the Navy's Fifth Fleet in Bahrain. This is prudent planning,
given the importance of the base and the potential risks to the
stability of the regime. Viable basing alternatives would lessen the
Bahraini regime's leverage for unconditional support. There have been a
few proposals in this direction. In 2013, a U.S. Navy captain published
a paper on Fifth Fleet basing alternatives.141 That same year, former
director of national intelligence Admiral Dennis Blair argued for moving
the Fifth Fleet headquarters back aboard a U.S. Navy flagship (as it was
before 1993) both to signal U.S. resolve for the need for Bahraini
government reforms and because of the vulnerability of U.S. bases there
given prior instability.142 The House version of the FY2016 National
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) contained a provision to require the
Department of Defense to report on alternative locations for the U.S.
Navy, but the final bill did not contain the provision.143 That
provision should be reinstated in the FY2020 NDAA. After all, Bahrain
does not have a viable external protector besides the United States:
neither China nor Russia at this time has the willingness or capability
to take on that role. Thus, the time is now while the balance of power
is in the United States' favor.

[The United States continues to support the Bahraini regime without
demanding reform, despite the fact that the monarchy's form of rule
violates **democratic principles** and **engenders** risks to Bahrain's
stability]{.underline}. As the United States learned from the Arab
Spring, deals with such dictatorships can rapidly collapse, and the
domestic conflicts that ensue can lead to much larger strategic
dilemmas. [Thus, though fraught and difficult, the reasonable approach
is to use existing Western leverage to push for gradual reforms that
give the Bahraini people hope for a better future under a constitutional
monarchy]{.underline}. A relatively stable, legitimate constitutional
monarchy will be a better guarantee of Western interests in the region
in the long run, especially when compared to the potential results of
continuing to support a brittle, absolute monarchy.

Given the size of the security sector procurement budget, the importance
of these purchases in sustaining coercion, the role the security sector
plays in the Bahraini people's grievances, and the leverage Western
governments have, security sector procurement reform is a good place to
start. [Gradual reform can act as a catalyst to rein in a free-spending
regime, giving foreign investors more confidence that Bahraini debt may
be worth purchasing and keeping the state better afloat.]{.underline} It
can also help bring more accountability to the regime and reduce human
rights abuses, thereby improving the legitimacy of the monarchy. Such
measures to mitigate against popular unrest can help better ensure in
the long term that the United States maintains its basing rights and
freedom of movement in the Persian Gulf region. [The reforms will not be
easy, but the rewards can be substantial, and the consequences of not
doing so **disastrous**.]{.underline}

Bahrain and Human Rights

The Al-Khalifa minority [ruling regime in Bahrain has participated in
the extrajudicial **killing** of Bahraini citizens from the Shia
majority and used **illegal arrests** and a pliant judiciary to jail
peaceful dissidents. The regime's **security forces** have frequently
invoked the so-called anti-terror laws to dissolve law-abiding political
groups]{.underline}, such as al-Wefaq and al-Waad, arrest their leaders,
and muzzle the few remaining semi-independent media outlets such as
al-Wasat newspaper.

The [regime has employed the security tentacles of the Bahraini "deep
state" to destroy all opposition to the regime.]{.underline} The
Al-[Khalifa autocrats have spent a lot of money through **lobbying**,
**compliant media**, "friendly" **think tanks**, well-funded
consultants]{.underline}---[many of whom are retired diplomats, military
officers, corporate executives, and sympathetic members of **Congress**
and the **executive** branch]{.underline}---to peddle a pro-regime
narrative. [The Bahraini regime has no shortage of "experts" and
**Washington insiders** willing to sing its praises.]{.underline}
Although a tiny monarchy, Bahrain has highlighted its central role in
serving American interests in the region. [As payback, the regime has
lobbied the Trump administration to support its domestic policies of
repression.]{.underline}

According to a recent Washington Post article, [the Bahraini government
claimed that it seized a secret bomb factory in a Bahraini
home]{.underline} containing lathes and hydraulic presses to make
tank-piercing explosively-formed projectiles or EFPs. By [claiming that
Iran supplied the weapons-making equipment]{.underline}, Bahraini
security officials are making every effort to convince Western
governments that Tehran is behind the anti-regime protest movement. [The
regime has conveyed this supposedly "breaking news" discovery to
Washington through such friendly think tanks as the Washington Institute
for Near East Policy]{.underline}.

[The regime has previously made similar assertions to discredit the
opposition and to paint it with a broad brush of terrorism]{.underline}.
The recent find, however, is arguably more ominous than previous ones.
Second, although in recent years certain elements of the opposition
movement have become more militant and have turned toward violence and
terrorism---the Iranian supported al-Ashtar Brigades is one example of
such Shia militancy---[the bulk of the opposition **remains
peaceful**]{.underline}.

Third, despite the regime's claims to the contrary, [violent Shia groups
in Bahrain do not represent the large majority of anti-regime
dissidents, whether individuals or groups. The regime's efforts to link
peaceful opposition with terrorists are disingenuous]{.underline}, and
it would be sad for Western countries to fall for this dubious claim.
Fourth, the [regime's draconian response to peaceful protests in the
past six years has fueled the rise of militancy within the Shia
majority. It was a calculated policy designed to produce the
self-fulfilling prophecy that the opposition consists of terrorists. In
this regard, the Al-Khalifa regime has followed a pattern established by
other autocrats in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and
elsewher]{.underline}e.

The New York Times reported last Thursday that the [US State Department
has decided to **lift human rights** as a condition for the sale of F-16
fighter jets and other weapons to Bahrain]{.underline}, a small, Sunni,
family-ruled kingdom in the Persian Gulf. Ostensibly, [the justification
that]{.underline} Secretary of State Rex [Tillerson gave for his
decision was that Bahrain is a key ally in the fight against
Iran-supported Houthis in Yemen]{.underline}. The US Navy Fifth Fleet is
also home-ported in Bahrain.

[This policy, however, clearly shows the growing influence of Bahrain's
lobbyists in Washington and the cozy relationships that Tillerson, the
former head of global giant Exxon, as well as Secretary of Defense James
Mattis and some current and retired military officers and diplomats,
have forged with Bahrain]{.underline}, the United Arab Emirates, and
other member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council. [These Sunni
countries]{.underline}, the largest of which is Saudi Arabia, [are ruled
by tribal potentates who violate their citizens' basic human rights
**blatantly, viciously, and systematically.**]{.underline}

In addition to Bahrain, the Trump [White House and the Tillerson State
Department are planning to jettison the human-rights requirement as a
condition for arms sales to other Middle Eastern autocratic
regimes]{.underline}, including Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.
These countries, especially the UAE, have been feverishly lobbying
Washington's power elites and opinion makers, including think tanks and
high-powered consultants, to remove the human-rights requirement and
focus instead on Iran and terrorism. Trump plans to convey this "good"
news to Egypt's autocrat Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on the latter's visit to
Washington. The same message would be relayed to Jordan's King Abdullah
when he comes calling.

[To the dismay of human rights organizations and many foreign-policy
experts who believe that a rational, effective foreign policy should be
to balance American national interest and democratic
values]{.underline}, a disquieting pattern is emerging in Trump's
management of relations with other nations.

[Promoting a narrow definition of the national interest at the expense
of human rights is shortsighted and, in the long run, a **losing
proposition**]{.underline}. [Washington often coddled dictators before
the Arab Spring because American policymakers believed in those
dictators' narrative that all was well and everything was under
control]{.underline}. They told American leaders not to worry about
their peoples' frustrations and anger.

Andrea Thompson, US Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and

increase in arms spending of Southeast Asian countries.

[Thompson met with her ASEAN counterparts at the sidelines of the 2019
Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore]{.underline}, including Philippine
Defense Undersecretary Ricardo David.

Last year, US President Donald Trump implemented a new strategy called
the Conventional Arms Transfer policy that added efficiency and
transparency in both foreign and commercial military sales
process[.]{.underline}

Thompson added that Washington received positive feedback from allies
and partners following the new policy.

\"So whether it's the importance of maritime security, which obviously
is so incredibly important to the Philippines, as well as equipment in
the counterterrorism fight. So added transparency, added a feedback
mechanism,\" Thompson said in a telephone press briefing Monday.

While the sales reflect the efficiency of the policy, Thompson noted
that it also indicates a long-term defense cooperation with partners and
allies.

### Philippine Human Rights Impacts

#### The human rights crisis in the Philippines causes a litany of impacts including extrajudicial killings and an HIV epidemic 

**Human Rights Watch, 18** ("Philippines Events of 2018", World Report
2019,
<https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/philippines)//SD>

[Extrajudicial Killings]{.underline}

[The Duterte administration's "war on drugs" continued in 2018 and
expanded into areas outside the capital,]{.underline} Metro Manila,
including to the provinces of Bulacan, Laguna, Cavite, and the cities of
Cebu and General Santos.

According to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA), [4,948
suspected drug users and dealers died during police operations
from]{.underline} July 1, [2016 to]{.underline} September 30,
[2018]{.underline}. [But this does not include the thousands of others
killed by unidentified gunmen]{.underline}. According to the Philippine
National Police (PNP), [22,983 such deaths since the "war on drugs"
began are classified as "homicides under investigation."]{.underline}

The exact number of fatalities is difficult to ascertain because [the
government has failed to disclose official documents about the "drug
war]{.underline}." It has issued contradictory statistics and, in the
case of these "homicides under investigation," stopped releasing the
figures altogether.

[Masked gunmen taking part in killings appeared to be working closely
with police]{.underline}, casting doubt on government claims that most
killings have been committed by vigilantes or rival drug gangs.

Duterte has vowed to continue his anti-drug campaign until his term ends
in 2022. [In July 2018, he again pledged to continue the "war on drugs,"
saying "it will be as relentless and chilling as on the day it
began."]{.underline}

Duterte has also vowed to protect police officers and agents carrying
out the "drug war" from prosecution. Except for a few high-profile
cases, [the killings have not been investigated.]{.underline}

[Human Rights Defenders]{.underline}

Since February 2017, [Senator Leila de Lima has been jailed on
politically motivated drug charges filed against her]{.underline} in
apparent retaliation for leading a Senate inquiry into the "drug war"
killings. Her plight has prompted international expressions of support.

In September, Duterte ordered the arrest of a colleague of de Lima's,
Senator Antonio Trillanes IV, by revoking his amnesty, forcing him to
remain at the Senate premises for weeks. In October, a Manila court
dismissed the government's petition to issue the arrest warrant against
Trillanes. Trillanes has been Duterte's most vocal critic since de Lima,
accusing the president and his family of corruption.

In February, the Department of Justice issued a petition that labeled
more than 600 people---among them Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, the United
Nations special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, and
dozens of leftist activists---as members of the Communist Party of the
Philippines (CPP) and its armed wing, the New People's Army (NPA). That
action put those individuals at risk of extrajudicial execution.
Tauli-Corpuz called the allegation "baseless, malicious and
irresponsible." In August, a Manila court removed her name from the
petition.

Philippine presidential spokesman Harry Roque alleged in March that
"some human rights groups have become unwitting tools of drug lords to
hinder the strides made by the administration." That echoed comments
made days prior by Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano
equating efforts of some unnamed human rights organizations to stop
Duterte's murderous "war on drugs" with "being used by drug lords."

[Children's Rights]{.underline}

The Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency
([PDEA]{.underline}) [announced]{.underline} in June [that it was
seeking to impose annual unannounced drug screening tests on teachers
and schoolchildren starting in the fourth grade]{.underline}. PDEA
sought to justify the move as an attempt to identify 10-year-old
potential drug users so they "can get intervention while they are still
young."

[Imposing drug testing on schoolchildren when Philippine police are
summarily killing alleged drug users endangers children should they fail
such a drug test]{.underline}. Mandatory testing may also violate
children's right to bodily integrity, constitute arbitrary interference
with their privacy and dignity, and may deter children from attending
school for reasons unrelated to any potential drug use.

[Police have killed dozens of children since the start of the "war on
drugs" in June 2016, deaths which Duterte has dismissed as "collateral
damage]{.underline}." In February, police arrested three police officers
implicated in the execution-style summary killing of 17-year-old Kian
Lloyd delos Santos in August 2017.

Attacks on Journalists

[The Duterte administration ratcheted up its attack on media freedom in
January 2018 by threatening the closure of Rappler.com, an online news
outlet critical of the "war on drugs." In November, the Department of
Justice indicted Rappler and its editor and founder, Maria Ressa, for
tax evasion. This followed months of attacks and harassment of Rappler
by the Duterte government and its supporters.]{.underline}

New draft regulations by the Philippine House of Representatives in May
would allow Congress to ban reporters who "besmirch" the reputation of
lawmakers from covering the national legislature. Journalists and some
members of Congress have denounced the proposed rule as dangerously
ambiguous and stifling.

[The killings of journalists continued in 2018, with six murdered by
unidentified gunmen in different parts of the country.]{.underline}

[HIV Epidemic]{.underline}

[The Philippines faces the fastest-growing epidemic of HIV in
Asia]{.underline}. According to the Joint United Nations Programme on
HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), [the number of new HIV cases jumped from 4,400 in
2010 to 12,000 in 2017]{.underline}, the last year for which data were
available. Most new infections---up to 83 percent---are among men and
transgender women who have sex with men. [There are now an estimated
68,000 Filipinos living with HIV]{.underline}.

[This increase has been attributed to government policy failures to
respond to the epidemic.]{.underline} Human Rights Watch research shows
that many sexually active young Filipinos have little or no knowledge
about the role of condoms in preventing sexually transmitted diseases
because the government fails to promote condoms vigorously, among other
factors.

[Human Rights Watch documented that workers and employees in
the Philippines living with HIV may suffer workplace discrimination
including refusal to hire, unlawful firing, and forced resignation of
people with HIV. Some employers may also disregard or actively
facilitate workplace harassment of employees who are HIV
positive]{.underline}. In February, Duterte suggested to a group of
returning overseas migrant workers that they avoid using condoms because
they "aren't pleasurable." 

In October, the Senate and House of Representatives approved a bill that
would amend the country's 20-year-old AIDS law. The new law outlines a
rights-based response to the epidemic and prohibits discrimination
against people with HIV in the workplace and other settings. It also
makes it unlawful to disclose the HIV status of an individual without
their consent. However, the law does not include specific provisions
directing the government to promote condom use.

[Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity]{.underline}

The Philippine Supreme Court heard a long-awaited argument in June that
could open the door to same-sex marriage in the overwhelmingly Catholic
country. In May, the city of Mandaluyong approved an ordinance to
protect the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)
people---the latest in a slew of similar local laws passed across the
country.

The House of Representatives unanimously passed a federal
nondiscrimination bill protecting LGBT people in September 2017, but
opponents have stalled a companion bill in the Senate. Representatives
also introduced a bill that would create civil partnerships and give
same-sex couples rights in adoption, insurance, inheritance, property,
and medical decision-making.

Key International Actors

In January 2018, the European Commission expressed strong concerns about
the Philippines' compliance with the human rights obligations related to
the trade preferences scheme from which it benefits.

In February, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC)
announced that she would open a preliminary examination into the "drug
war" killings in the Philippines. The Duterte administration responded
by withdrawing from the Rome Statute, which takes effect in one year. In
April, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on the
Philippines to put an end to the drug war and ensure accountability, and
on the EU to use all available mean---including suspending trade
benefits if necessary---to persuade the Philippines to reverse its
abusive trend.

Asian governments have expressed implicit or explicit support for the
anti-drug campaign. The Indonesian government in
February awarded then-Philippine National Police Director-General Ronald
dela Rosa its highest honor, the Medal of Honor, for his "rock star-like
inspiration to the Indonesian national police and the Indonesian people
on how to fight the war on drugs."

In May, the South Korean Embassy in Manila and the Korean Police
National Agency donated more than 130 vehicles to the Philippines
National Police despite its role in the "drug war" killings.

[The US Congress regularly appropriates assistance to the Philippine
government, including substantial financing for arms sales]{.underline}
as well as funds for law enforcement and military training. Law
enforcement funding is restricted to drug user treatment projects and
marine and international interdiction programs. [The US military also
routinely provides the Philippines military with second-hand military
vehicles, ships, and non-lethal equipment.]{.underline}

Iceland led a joint statement on behalf of 38 states at the June session
of the United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC), building on two
previous joint statements, condemning the extrajudicial killings and
calling for "a more formal Council initiative" if needed to hold the
Philippines to its obligations as a member of the Council. It also
called for the Philippines to "cooperate with the international
community" to ensure investigations into these deaths. On October 12,
the Philippines was elected to serve a second three-year term on the UN
HRC, starting January 2019.

this, [assassinations of human rights lawyers, journalists, labor and
peasant organizers, indigenous leaders, clergy, teachers, and activists
are spiraling out of control.]{.underline}

[Duterte has systematically silenced voices of political dissent,
jailing Senator Leila DeLima, an early drug war critic; ousting Supreme
Court Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno, who opposed the imposition of
martial law in Mindanao; and now arresting Maria Ressa, internationally
renowned journalist and executive editor of the indy
outlet [Rappler](https://www.rappler.com/).]{.underline}

Meanwhile, less known to U.S. audiences, [Duterte has repeatedly dropped
bombs on Philippine soil, impacting
over [368,000](https://www.karapatan.org/2018-Karapatan-HR-Report) people ---

have been displaced by militarization]{.underline}. After scuttling
peace talks with the National Democratic Front of the Philippines
(NDFP), [Duterte has jailed internationally protected peace consultants.
And in January, consultant Randy Malayao
was [murdered](https://www.rappler.com/nation/222301-human-rights-groups-statements-death-ndf-consultant-randy-m) in
cold blood by armed hit men.]{.underline}

Ever [since the Philippines attained formal independence in 1946, the
U.S. has maintained a military presence on its former colony, guiding
and supporting "counter-insurgency" operations]{.underline}to put down
constant rebellions against an oligarchic government. Today, t[he
Philippine armed forces overwhelmingly direct violence not against
outside invaders, but at poor and marginalized people within its
borders. U.S. military aid is only making internal conflict
worse.]{.underline}

[U.S. taxpayer funds are bankrolling the worsening human rights crisis
in the Philippines.]{.underline}

[Duterte's repressive regime is
the [largest](http://philippineslifestyle.com/military-aid-usa-philippines/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank%22%20%5Co%20%22largest) [recipient](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/0) of

military [aid](https://explorer.usaid.gov/agencies/?agency=7&year=2017&measure=Obl)]{.underline} in
East and Southeast Asia.

In 2016, the U.S. helped inaugurate Duterte's drug war by giving [[\$32
million]{.underline}](http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/07/27/1607298/us-pledges-32m-philippine-law-enforcement) to

in "policing standards" and "rule of law,"
besides [[equipment]{.underline}](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/de)). In
July 2018, the United States announced an additional [[\$26.5
million]{.underline}](https://ph.usembassy.gov/united-states-to-b) in
U.S. tax dollars to beef up support for Philippine police, in the name
of "counter-terrorism."

[In FY2018, the Defense Department provided [roughly \$100
million](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2019-02/OPEP_Q119_Dec2018_final.pdf%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank%22%20%5Co%20%22roughly%20$100%20million) in
military aid, including equipment, weapons, and aerial surveillance
systems, to the Philippine military and police, though Operation Pacific
Eagle --- a so-called "overseas contingency operation" that
is [exempt](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R44519.pdf%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank%22%20%5Co%20%22exempt) from

FY2019 --- ]{.underline}even as[the Defense Department
has [admitted](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/defa) it lost track of
transactions for 76 of 77 arms sales conducted ]{.underline}under
bilateral agreements[with the Philippines.]{.underline}

[In 2018]{.underline}, on top of the above, [the U.S. sold the
Philippine [police](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2019-02/OPEP_Q119_Dec2018_final.pdf%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank%22%20%5Co%20%22police) and [military](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2018-11/lig-oco-op) over
\$63 million worth of arms. It]{.underline}also [donated [2,253 machine

over [5 million](https://ph.usembassy.gov/us-government-provide) rounds
of ammunition, surveillance equipment, and other
weapons. ]{.underline}Military aid totaled at least \$193.5 million last
year, not including arms sales, and donated equipment of unreported
worth. At least \$145.6 million is already pledged for 2019.

In January, Trump authorized \$1.5 billion annually for the Asian
Pacific region, including the Philippines, from 2019 to 2023. Although
this authorization includes
a [[stipulation]{.underline}](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2736/text%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank%22%20%5Co%20%22stipulation) that
counter-narcotics funds will not go to the Philippines ("except for drug
demand reduction," a potential loophole), it's too little, too late. The
set-aside has no restrictions on weapons funding for the Philippine
military. And separately, the State Department already plans to
deliver [[\$5.3 million]{.underline}](https://www.state) this year to
the Philippine police for anti-narcotics activities. Worse, rampant
corruption together with a total lack of transparency means it's hard to
ensure where military aid could actually end up.

[U.S. military equipment forms the backbone of Duterte's "military
modernization" program.]{.underline}

Although the above aid is tiny compared to the U.S.'s own bloated
military budget, [this tremendous transfer of weapons and surveillance
technology is significant in propping up the Philippine armed forces'
capacity.]{.underline}

Du[terte has embarked on an ambitious program to "modernize" the
Philippine military, massively increasing funding and pouring more money
towards this than spent in [the last 15
years](https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2018/10/21/1861787/)]{.underline}.
(Meanwhile, he's [doubled](https://news.abs-cbn) the salaries of
military and police.) [He could not do so without U.S. aid and
arms.]{.underline}

For its part, the U.S. is particularly interested
in [[expanding]{.underline}](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/) aerial
"intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance" missions over Mindanao,
the largest island in the Southern Philippines, rich in untapped mineral
resources. Without U.S. aid, the Philippine military would lack the
airplanes and technology to perform this surveillance.

What's more, this year's Operation Pacific Eagle budget sets aside an
extra [[\$3.5
million]{.underline}](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2019-02/OPEP_Q119_Dec20) for
U.S. military efforts to collect and analyze "local media in native
languages" --- underscoring that the U.S. is striving for an upper hand
in directing Philippine military operations. And in winning an
information war over public opinion.

In recent years, the U.S. has had up
to [[5,000]{.underline}](https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/your-marine-corps/2018/08/09/pentagon-tripl) troops
deployed in the Philippines at any one time. Officially, U.S. troops are
limited to "joint exercises" and war games. But questions have been
raised over [[possible U.S.
personnel]{.underline}](https://www.ma) involvement in secretive
missions, resulting in killings of civilians and human rights abuses.

In the case of the
2015 [[Mamasapano]{.underline}](https://www) [[massacre]{.underline}](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/669237/moro-group-7-civilians-killed-3-wounded-in-mamasapano-clash),

guidance and surveillance support, despite U.S. denials. Meanwhile, U.S.
troops who themselves commit human rights abuses, murder, or sexual
assault, are insulated from being held accountable by the
U.S.-Philippines Visiting Forces Agreement.

What are the consequences of the bonanza of military aid for Duterte? 

The bottom line is, [the U.S. government is complicit in --- and
actively supporting --- the deepening human rights crisis in the
Philippines.]{.underline}

In June 2018, [72](https://www.philstar.com/headli) schools were unable
to hold classes because of military

students could not attend school because of nearby military encampments.

The schools under attack are part of
a [movement](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/07/11/1831716/lumad-schools-even-holding-class-struggle%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank%22%20%5Co%20%22movement) led
by indigenous groups, together with NGOs and church partners, to provide
relevant education for their youth, a service largely neglected by the
government. [Ninety

indigenous children lack access to formal education. In the 2000s,
indigenous

their struggles for self-determination, in hopes that education would
help protect them from land-grabbing. The military has sought to brand
community schools as "training camps" for communist insurgents, recently
launching Facebook campaigns towards this purpose.

[U.S. military aid is intensifying the conflict in Mindanao,
exacerbating its impact on civilians.U.S. investment in aerial
surveillance will escalate an air war that has a brutal and
indiscriminate effect on people as well as the
environment. ]{.underline}The integration of "intelligence" activity in
counter-terrorism is dangerous. It will likely worsen repression against
anyone organizing for indigenous, labor, and human rights --- [feeding a
growing bloodbath as paramilitaries are employed to undermine these
local struggles, while providing cover for government troops to escape
accountability.]{.underline}

[Today's violence is inseparable from the U.S.'s imperial shadow. The
drug war is a purge of humans deemed worthless in a society where social
safety nets were never allowed to be developed, where the failure of
neoliberal economic reforms now plays into the hands of despotism, and
where U.S.-backed elites regularly employ state-paid goons to undermine
democracy.]{.underline}

Placed in historical context, Mindanao, and those lands of indigenous
communities under attack, were some of the last outposts resisting
Spanish and U.S. rule. The islands --- dubbed by [Trump]{.underline} "a
prime piece of real estate from a military standpoint" --- have long
served as a stepping stone towards U.S. aspirations of dominance in the
Asia-Pacific. [U.S. military aid continues a long process of
"pacification" --- and colonial conquest, now unfolding in neocolonial
forms.]{.underline}

People's movements in the Philippines are calling for international
solidarity, to end the U.S.-backed militarization of their communities. 

They demand also peace with justice --- a peace process that adopts
structural reforms like those outlined
in [CASER](https://www.ndfp.org/sayt/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/NDFP-CASER-2017-Web-version-Ver2.0.pdf%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank%22%20%5Co%20%22CASER),
a program the NDFP sought to reach agreement on implementing via peace
talks, that includes land reform, rescinding neoliberal economic
policies, and respecting indigenous land and self-determination.

In 2016, [[Sandugo]{.underline}](http://sandugo.org/), a historic
alliance of indigenous and Moro groups from across the Philippines,
formed, uniting for self-determination and a just peace. Three thousand
delegates met in Manila, and protesters converged on the U.S. embassy,
under a banner calling for an end to U.S. intervention and
militarization. At the gates of the U.S. embassy, the Philippine police
responded by beating people indiscriminately, and a [[police van ran
over the
crowd]{.underline}](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/philippines-police-van-rams-protesters-outside-us-embassy-in-manila%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank%22%20%5Co%20%22police%20van%20ran%20over%20the%20crowd),
injuring dozens.

Three years later, the call to end U.S. military aid and lift martial
law continues.

In terms of the drug war, one of the first groups to come out in vocal
opposition was [Kadamay](https://www.facebook.com), a mass-based
organization of urban poor people. Instead of killings, Kadamay has
called for addressing poverty and the root causes of the drug problem
--- in short, for drug addiction to be treated as a health, not
criminal, issue. More recently, an organization of family members of
those killed in the drug war has formed, [Rise Up For Life and
Rights](https://www.facebook.com/Rise-Up-for-Life-and-for-Rights-363258137385786/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank%22%20%5Co%20%22Rise%20Up%20For%20Life%20and%20Rights).

When the Philippine Senate tried to [restrict
funding](https://www.rappler.com/nation/189915-philippine-senate-approves-2018-national-budget%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank%22%20%5Co%20%22restrict%20funding) for
Duterte's drug war in late 2017, the U.S. stepped in to provide funds
that filled the shortfall.

To evade accountability, Duterte has [shifted](http://cnnphilipp) drug
war operations from under the Philippine National Police (PNP) to the
Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency and back to the PNP's general
operation funds. Recently,
he [eliminated](http://nine.cnnphilippines.com/news/2018/08/30/PN) keeping
a separate budget item for the drug war --- obscuring how much money is
being expended on it. The Philippine Congress has not been able to
provide effective oversight.

The continuing drug war killings and rampant human rights abuses only
underscore that [there is no way to ensure U.S. military aid to the
Duterte regime does not enable human rights violations]{.underline}. For
its part, [U.S. military spending is not only overblown, but also often
untraceable, secretive, and unaccountable]{.underline}. From Central
America to Palestine to the Philippines,[U.S. military aid has a sordid
legacy of fueling atrocities.]{.underline}

A growing movement is calling on Congress to cut military aid, arms
gifts, and arm sales to the Philippines --- as well as to end support
for the Duterte regime.

[**Congress must exercise its powers to ensure the Leahy Law, **which
stipulates no funding shall be furnished to foreign security forces if

Current Human Rights Situation 

[The Philippine government continues to commit human rights violations
with impunity]{.underline}. According
to [Karapatan](http://karapatan.org/), President Aquino's implementation
of the counterinsurgency program Oplan Bayanihan (Operation Shoulder to
Shoulder) **[has thus far resulted in 152 documented cases of
extrajudicial killings, 168 attempted killings, 18 instances of forced
disappearance, 80 cases of torture, 608 cases of illegal arrest, and
more than 30,000
forced [evacuations](http://karapatan.org/files/Karapatan_Monitor_Issue2_2013_WEB.pdf%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank%22%20%5Co%20%22evacuations).]{.underline}**

General Jovito [Palparan [faces a 2011 warrant of
arrest](http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/01/31) from a Bulacan court for his
involvement in the 2006 disappearance of two student activists in
Central Luzon]{.underline}. He is still in hiding, probably with the
assistance of the Philippine armed forces. Palparan is regarded as the
key implementer of Oplan Bantay Laya and was promoted by Arroyo at the
height of the extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances.

[The promotion of military generals who are known human rights violators
is an indication of the persistent climate of impunity]{.underline}
under the Aquino administration. **[The military, private armies, and
paramilitary units [silence independent media
outlets](http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/545429/killing-of-jo) and
journalists with impunity]{.underline}**. Journalists [face rampant
vandalism of their offices, constant intimidation and surveillance, and
abduction and killings]{.underline}. In December 2013, Rogelio Butalid,
a block-timer for 107.9 FM Radyo Natin, was shot dead by a lone killer
in Tagum City in Davao del Norte province shortly after he finished his
radio program. That same month, radioman Michael Milo was gunned down in
Tandag City in Surigao del Sur province.

This has also affected U.S. citizens active in Philippine solidarity, as
evidenced by the 2009 abduction and torture of BAYAN USA member and
Filipina-American activist Melissa Roxas by the Philippine military.
Roxas has [filed
complaints](http://justiceformelissa.org/press/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank%22%20%5Co%20%22filed%20complaints) with
the U.S. Department of State and the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture,
in addition to exhausting the domestic court system in the Philippines.

[Lawyers and human rights groups providing counsel to activists
imprisoned on trumped up charges have become targets of repression
themselves.]{.underline} They are **[subject to extra-judicial killings,
violent harassment, illegal detention, and surveillance by a state
apparatus keen to silence dissent]{.underline}**. For example, Army
chief Lt. Gen. Noel Coballes recently named the human rights
organization Karapatan an "[enemy of the
state](http://www.businessweekmindanao.com/2013/07)" for its objection
to the promotion of Brig. Gen. Aurelio Baladad. Baladad faces a string
of credible charges, including the illegal arrest of 43 community health
workers in a dawn raid in Morong by a swarm of Philippine Army and
police personnel just before Arroyo's term ended.

According to the National Union of People's Lawyers (NUPL) --- which has
been at the forefront of efforts to legally challenge government
repression --- "[This statement from a top military official is
dangerous and betrays what various organizations and concerned groups
have said all along, that the present counterinsurgency program Oplan
Bayanihan is no different from the deadly Oplan Bantay
Laya]{.underline}."

Leaders of people's organizations are also [facing criminal
charges](http://www.philstar.com/metro/2013/08/01/1036741/militant-groups-sued-over-sona-protest%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank%22%20%5Co%20%22facing%20criminal%20charges) over
a protest held during President Aquino's State of the Nation Address
last July. According to NUPL, in the course of negotiating with police
representatives for a resolution to the impasse, the police suddenly
attacked protesters, hurting scores of people --- including the NUPL
Secretary General.

U.S. Intervention

The Philippines, a U.S. colony for the first half of the 20th century,
is considered a key strategic partner for U.S. economic and strategic
interests. The large Subic and Clark bases, for example, played a key
role in the Vietnam War. In return, from 1972 to 1986, the [United
States supported the Marcos military dictatorship with massive economic
and military aid.]{.underline}

In the mid-1980s, the Philippine people ousted Marcos and enacted a
new constitution that banned "foreign military bases, troops, or
facilities" unless duly ratified by Congress or a national referendum.
In 1991, the Philippine government banned all permanent foreign bases
from its soil, and in 1992, the last American base closed down after
relentless street protests and campaigning.

But in 1998, Washington and Manila signed a [Visiting Forces Agreement
(VFA),](http://ph.news.yahoo.com/blogs/the-inbox/us-access-talks-pr-1730542) which
allowed the United States to establish 22 "semi-permanent" bases in the
archipelago to get around the ban that opposition to U.S. bases had
prompted. Former U.S. ambassador to the Philippines Thomas Hubbard
signed the VFA as an executive agreement rather than a treaty,
eliminating the need for the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate.
Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon signed the VFA on behalf of the
Philippines, and the Philippine Senate ratified the agreement.

After the 9/11 attacks, President Arroyo was one of the first heads of
state to [pledge
support](http://www.bulatlat.com/news/4-31/4-31-911.html%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank%22%20%5Co%20%22pledge%20support) to
President George W. Bush's "war on terror." Since 2002, the Joint
Special Operations Task Force Philippines, which comprises about 500
members of the U.S. military, has been stationed at a "temporary" base
in the southern Philippines. [Constitutional
challenges](http://manilasta) to the VFA by human rights lawyers have
been thus far unsuccessful. On June 27, 2013, Philippine Defense
Minister Voltaire Gazmin and his Japanese counterpart announced that the
Philippines would be establishing basing arrangements with both the
United States and Japan, which would increase the U.S. troop presence in
the Philippines. Human rights lawyers quickly pointed out that the
arrangement would circumvent [the constitution and the VFA](http://ww).

In early November, disagreements between U.S. and Filipino
negotiators [prolonged](http://www.10news.com/news/military/philippines-us-disagree-in-talks-to-escalate-american-troop-deployments11052013%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank%22%20%5Co%20%22prolonged) the
talks on the increased U.S. troop presence. But after Typhoon Haiyan,
both Manila and Washington are justifying more U.S. troops as part of
humanitarian aid missions, and [negotiations are back on
track](http://www.voanews.com/content/philippines-us-typhoon-response-sho).

[The Philippines, as one of the closest U.S. allies in Asia, is crucial
to the [Obama administration's "pivot" to
Asia](http://www.reuters.com/articl), which aims to counter the rising
influence of China on the world stage. The United States provided more
than [\$507 million](http://globalnation.inquirer.net/16777/us-has) in
military assistance]{.underline} to the Philippines from 2001 to 2010.
After pressure from human rights groups inside the Philippines ---
[which were supported by international efforts to bring attention to
extrajudicial killings, disappearances, and other human rights
violations]{.underline} --- U.S. military aid decreased and the United
States withheld the release of some military financing. A March 2007
Senate hearing resulted in the [cutting of a
portion](http://www.laborrights.org/end-violence-against-trade-unions/philippines/military-aid-to-the-philippines%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank%22%20%5Co%20%22cutting%20of%20a%20portion) of
the 2008 U.S. Foreign Military Financing package to the Armed Forces of
the Philippines due to the latter's involvement in human rights abuses.

[U.S. funding]{.underline} was down to \$11.9 million in 2011. It [is on
the rise again]{.underline}, however, [and with it a dramatic increase
in human rights violations against activists, many of whom are
farmworkers, peasants, and indigenous people opposed to the incursions
of multi-national corporations and the theft of their land.]{.underline}
The most [recent incident
happened](http://www.karapatan.org/Karapatan+enraged+by+we) on February
5, when two unidentified men onboard a red motorcycle shot and killed
41-year old peasant leader Julieto Lauron, who was with organizer Nermie
Lapatis on their way to the village of Haindangon, Valencia
City. Lapatis had recently moved to Valencia City because of threats
against her life. As an organizer among indigenous peoples in Bukidnon,
Lapatis campaigned against the entry of large-scale mining companies in
the area, earning the ire of the military and paramilitary groups.

[Military aid in
2012](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/03/us-philippines-usa-idUSBRE8420IU20120503%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank%22%20%5Co%20%22Military%20aid%20in%202012) rose
to \$30 million, and the Philippine foreign ministry recently announced
that the United States has increased the [military assistance

Bolivian government expelled him and President Evo Morales declared
him [persona non grata](http://www.teleg) for "conspiring against

signal the U.S. government's renewed support for [Oplan
Bayanihan](http://www.karapatan.org/Aquino+Oplan+Bayanihan+failure+waste+of+people's+mo),
the Aquino administration's counter-insurgency program and the latest
attempt to end a 45-year-old insurgency led by the Communist Party of
the Philippines and its armed wing, the New People's Army (NPA). Oplan
Bayanihan has adopted a similar framework and similar techniques to
Oplan Bantay Laya, and has led to human rights violations. These
techniques include [smearing all opposition activists as
Communists](http://www.asienhaus.de/menschenrechte-philippinen/tl_files/aktionsbuendnis/dok) and
treating them no differently than the NPA.

[Systematic human rights violations are]{.underline} also [being
committed in the very same places where foreign interests are currently
operating]{.underline} or exploring new ventures in highly destructive
industries such as open-pit mining, cash-crop agriculture, oil and gas
extraction, and logging. For example, Human Rights Watch has
documented [cases](http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/philippines?page=2%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank%22%20%5Co%20%22cases) in
which critics of mining and energy projects have been killed, allegedly
by paramilitary forces under military control. The activists had been
vocal in opposing mining and energy operations that they said threatened
the environment and would displace tribal communities from their land.
These include the southern Philippine island of Mindanao, where [massive

Time to End U.S. Military Aid

U.S. military aid to the Philippines violates U.S. laws regulating aid
to human rights-violating militaries. [The U.S. Arms Export Control Act,
as well as the Leahy Law, stipulates that no funding shall be furnished
to foreign security forces if the United States has knowledge that those
forces have committed "a gross violation of human rights." Yet human
rights violations committed by the Philippine military do not currently
affect the frequency or quantity of U.S. military aid provided to the
Philippines.]{.underline}

[Human rights groups in the Philippines, such as Karapatan, have called
for an end to U.S. [military
involvement](http://www.karapatan.org/US+troops+in+PH+violates+sovereignty,+perpetuates+impunity%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank%22%20%5Co%20%22military%20involvement) that
"violates the sovereignty of the Philippines and perpetuates the culture
of impunity" for rights abusers.]{.underline}

As Americans, we must ask why the U.S. government is sending millions of
our taxpayer dollars to the Philippine military at the same time as this
institution is committing systematic human rights violations. [U.S.
military involvement in the Philippines must end.]{.underline}

### AT: Fill-in

#### Russia or China fill-in takes too long -- no interoperability 

**Reuters, 16** (Thomas, "Philippine president\'s threat to stop buying
weapons from U.S. would face obstacles", CBC, 10/4/16,
<https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/philippine-us-weapons-1.3791657)//SD>

Philippine President Rodrigo [Duterte would face major obstacles to
following through on his threat to reduce purchases of U.S. weapons in
favour of Russian and Chinese arms]{.underline}, including retraining a
military deeply accustomed to working with the United States, experts
said on Tuesday.

Duterte said in speeches in Manila on Tuesday that the United States did
not want to sell missiles and other weapons to the Philippines, but that
Russia and China had told him they could provide them easily.

His comments were the latest in a near-daily barrage of hostility toward
the United States that has raised questions about the long-standing
alliance that is important to the U.S. strategy of rebalancing its
forces toward Asia and countering an assertive China.

Angered by U.S. expressions of concern over his war on drugs, Duterte
has called President Barack Obama a \"[[son of a
bitch,\"]{.underline}](http://cbc.ca/1.3749291%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) threatened
to call off joint military exercises with Washington and started to
contrast the former colonial power with its geopolitical rivals Russia
and China.

U.S. officials have downplayed Duterte\'s remarks, focusing instead on
the decades-long alliance which they have sought to bolster in recent
years in response to China\'s moves to enforce its claims over the South
China Sea. The White House said on Tuesday the United States had not
received any formal communications from Duterte\'s government about
changing the relationship.

Largest provider of arms

The United States is the single largest provider of arms to the
Philippines, according to figures maintained by the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), which tracks military
expenditures globally.

The two countries have become more intertwined militarily in the last
two years, holding more exercises and training, and making more U.S.
ship and aircraft visits under Obama\'s shift of U.S. military forces
and diplomatic efforts toward Asia in the face of China\'s rise.

[The Philippines is the largest recipient of U.S. funds in the
Asia-Pacific region under the foreign military financing
program]{.underline}, which is provided by the United States to help
countries purchase American-made weapons and equipment. It received \$50
million under the program in the 2015 fiscal year.

[That dependence on U.S. weapons and systems means the Philippine
military would have to retool its command-and-control structure if it
wanted to switch to Chinese or Russian systems,]{.underline} said
Richard Javad Heydarian, a professor at De La Salle University in Manila
and a former adviser to the Philippines House of Representatives.

\"[There will be some problems with configuration,\"]{.underline}
Heydarian said[. \"It takes years for the Philippines\' army to reorient
itself with new technology.\"]{.underline}

The Philippines spent \$3.9 billion on its military in 2015, according
to SIPRI data. That spending has risen nearly every year since 2010,
when it stood at \$2.4 billion, the data shows.

Weapons have to work together

[Though Russia in particular could offer high-quality weapons systems,
the Philippines would have to take into account their interoperability
with existing American stock,]{.underline} said Lyle Goldstein, an
expert on Chinese maritime issues at the U.S. Naval War College.

\"[You can\'t just buy radar from this country and a missile from that
country,\"]{.underline} Goldstein said[. \"The weaponry has to work
together.\"]{.underline}

## Transactionalism / LIO Adv

### Trump Arms Sales Policy =\> Transactionalism

#### Trump's policy towards arms sales is rooted in transactionalism.

No one should be surprised at President Trump\'s reaction to the alleged
assassination of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the hands
of the Saudis. From even before he announced his candidacy and through
the earliest days of his presidency, [Trump has been completely
consistent in his approach to Saudi Arabia,]{.underline} always
[stressing the royal family\'s wealth and pushing for more of that money
to be given to the United States.]{.underline} In 2014, Trump tweeted,
\"Tell Saudi Arabia and others that we want (demand!) free oil for the
next ten years or we will not protect their private Boeing 747s. Pay
Up!\" In 2015, he tweeted \"they must pay dearly! NO FREEBIES.\"

\"[**His is an extremely transactional foreign policy**, quid pro

science at Duke University and a veteran of the National Security
Council staff in both the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush White Houses.
[That]{.underline} helps [explain why the president is putting heavy
emphasis on pending sales of]{.underline} American equipment and
[arms]{.underline} and is adopting a cautious, go-slow response to
Khashoggi\'s disappearance and presumed death. In his travel to 19
countries and in the 91 visits to the United States by foreign leaders,
the president has repeatedly been the Salesman in Chief, hawking U.S.
equipment and arms.

Over and over again, [the president has warned other leaders that they
needed to pony up the dollars if they wanted U.S. protection or
favors.]{.underline} That was on display prior to his very first foreign
trip, a two-day visit to Saudi Arabia in May 2017. In an interview with
the Christian Broadcasting Network, Trump boasted of twisting Saudi arms
to get them to purchase American equipment. \"Saudi Arabia put up
hundreds of billions of dollars of money going into buying our planes
and our military equipment and investing in our country,\" he said.
\"And I said you have to do that, otherwise I\'m not going.\"

In an interview with Fox Business on Wednesday, Trump said the Saudis
\"committed to purchase \$450 billion worth of things, and \$110 billion
worth of military.\" He called those \"the biggest orders in the history
of this country, probably the history of the world.\" Numerous
fact-checkers at several news organizations have pointed out, though,
that this wildly overstates what the Saudis have agreed to buy and that
much of the total comes from deals previously announced by President
Obama. As Defense News reported Thursday, the Pentagon notes that Saudi
Arabia has signed new letters of offer and acceptance for only \$14.5
billion in \"helicopters, tanks, ships, weapons, and training.\" Other
fact-checkers trace less than \$4 billion in actual sales to Trump\'s
announcement in Riyadh.

The hyperbole is another constant in the president\'s transactional
approach to foreign policy. Here are 10 ways that policy has played out:

Saudi Arabia \"peanuts\"

No words were necessary when Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman
dropped in to the Oval Office on March 20. The president had charts with
colorful pictures of military equipment and planes. \"In terms of
dollars\--\$3 billion, \$533 million, \$525 million,\" he said, rattling
off price tags of the pictured equipment. \"That\'s peanuts for you,\"
he added to laughter. \"You should have increased it.\"
[Trump]{.underline} also [brushed aside an Obama administration delay on
precision-guided munitions that]{.underline} U.S. officials believe
[have been used by the Saudis to kill civilians in the war against
Yemen.]{.underline}

Embracing the military-industrial complex

In 1961, President Eisenhower warned against the \"unwarranted influence
\... by the military-industrial complex.\" Fifty-seven years later,
another Republican president has made the care and feeding of that
complex official government policy. Earlier this year, the
administration released its new Conventional Arms Transfer policy. The
first CAT, issued by President Carter in 1977, contained a presumption
of denial of arms deals that was embodied in what came to be known as
the \"leprosy letter\" sent to all U.S. embassies. Trump\'s policy turns
that on its head, putting the burden of proof on those who oppose any
deals. Significantly, the new policy was announced by the architect of
Trump\'s trade policy, Peter Navarro, and not by anyone with expertise
on foreign policy or national security. [**The White House also eased
export restrictions and promised speedier approval of
deals.**]{.underline} In April, Trump complained that some deals did not
get approval for years. \"It\'s now going to be a matter of days,\" he
promised.

[Enlisting diplomats as salesmen]{.underline}

The White House described the new arms policy as a \"whole of
government\" approach. That has real implications for military attaches
and American diplomats, according to Caroline Dorminey, a defense-policy
analyst at the Cato Institute. \"The change,\" she wrote earlier this
year, \"[will effectively turn civil servants who had been third-party
brokers between foreign governments and American defense contractors
into de facto salespeople.\"]{.underline}

A bull market in drones

[U.S. manufacturers of drones have]{.underline} long chafed at
restrictions on their sales to foreign governments. [In Trump, they
found an ally.]{.underline} In a still-classified order [in April, the
president]{.underline} stopped short of lifting all restrictions but he
[made it much easier for them to sell American drones in the Middle
East]{.underline} and elsewhere.

Fast forward to the current Administration. President [Trump's clear
affinity for strongmen leaders, his failure to fill the position at the
State Department responsible for democracy, human rights, and labor two
years into his term, his undemocratic rhetoric, and his efforts to cut
aid in this field have done enormous harm to the leadership role played
by the United States over the years]{.underline}. Despite the problems
associated with Bush's Freedom Agenda and Obama's seeming lack of
interest in the issue, [human rights activists and
dissidents]{.underline} still turned to the United States for moral,
financial, and political support. These days, they [are not sure where
to turn.]{.underline}

Under the current Administration, **[human rights simply are not a
priority, a position made crystal clear by Trump's recent comments
concerning Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**, despite the Kingdom's abominable
treatment of human beings and the murder of Khashoggi. Former Secretary
of State Rex [Tillerson warned that prioritizing]{.underline} American
values ([human rights) could harm other American interests]{.underline},
a position for which he was roundly criticized. Trump's admiration for
leaders like Egypt's Sisi, the Philippines' Duterte, Russia's Putin, and
North Korea's Kim is demoralizing to human rights advocates everywhere.
Despite Kim's unparalleled brutality in North Korea, Trump at a campaign
rally said that he and Kim "[fell in
love](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-north-korea-kim-jong-un-love-1145179)"
through their various exchanges; one can only imagine if Obama had said
such a thing. There are two positive exceptions to this record: 1) the
current Administration has maintained sanctions under the Magnitsky Act
on Russian officials and imposed additional sanctions under the global
version of it, albeit under Congressional pressure, and 2) the
Administration has spoken out on the abuses committed by the Maduro,
Castro and Ortega regimes in Latin America.

[What Is to Be Done?]{.underline}

Supporting human rights and democratic governance around the world does
not and should not mean imposing American values on others or staging
military interventions. Each country, if given the opportunity, will
develop in its own unique way. But our support does involve peacefully
aiding local activists who look to the United States for moral,
political, diplomatic, and sometimes material support. These activists
often risk prison, torture, and death struggling for a more democratic
society; helping them reflects our own highest principles. It is the
least we can do.

Today, with the current wave of nationalism and populism, human rights
are facing new challenges from some unexpected places, including the
United States---but don't expect advocates to quit. NATO and the
European Union, along with the OSCE have played a key role on the
European continent in supporting the cause of human rights and freedom;
while not a member of the European Union, the United States is a key
member of NATO and the OSCE.

In the Western Hemisphere, despite a long history of authoritarian rule,
sometimes  aided and abetted by the United States, individuals have
challenged human rights abuses. With the support of the Organization of
American States (OAS), the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties
of Man in 1948 established a vehicle for the investigation of human
rights abuses throughout the hemisphere with the Inter-American
Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), which was followed 20 years later by
the establishment of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. Here,
too, the United States has played an important role.

[Safeguarding the institutionalization of human rights within these
organizations is absolutely critical to guarantee that defenders and
advocates have a strong voice]{.underline}. As long as they keep on
taking the risks to do so, they deserve to have the United States
standing with them. [But this requires speaking out consistently when
abuses occur.]{.underline} **[It mandates placing human rights and
advancing the cause of freedom high on the foreign policy priorities
list.]{.underline}** **[It means distancing ourselves from authoritarian
regimes]{.underline}**, recognizing that the way they treat their own
people is often indicative of how they will behave in foreign policy and
toward other countries. It means not whitewashing gross human rights
abuses.

In his address before the UN General Assembly this past September,
President Trump underscored the idea of sovereignty, declaring: "We will
never surrender America's sovereignty to an unelected, unaccountable
global bureaucracy. America is governed by Americans. We reject the
ideology of globalism. And we embrace the doctrine of patriotism."
[Trump went on to inform his fellow leaders that "the United States will
not tell you how to live or work or worship. We only ask that you honor
our sovereignty in return."]{.underline}

[Such a declaration both misrepresents what the United States had sought
to do over the past seven-plus decades in maintaining and nurturing the
international order---**which has largely been a huge net gain for human
rights and democracy,**]{.underline} albeit with significant
exceptions---[and telegraphed to authoritarian leaders that they could
get away with bloody murder without worrying about repercussions from
the United States,]{.underline} either bilaterally or through
multilateral organizations. **[That became even more explicit with the
murder of Khashoggi.]{.underline}**

"[Democracy has spread and endured,"]{.underline} writes Robert Kagan in
his most recent book, The Jungle Grows Back, "[because it has been
nurtured and supported: by the norms of the liberal order, by the
membership requirements of liberal institutions like the European Union
and NATO, by the fact that the liberal order has been the wealthiest
part of the world, and by the security provided by the world's strongest
power, which happens to be a democracy."]{.underline}

And yet, in 2018, as Patricia O'Toole writes in her book, The Moralist:
Woodrow Wilson and the World He Made, "as Woodrow Wilson's 100 years
came to an end, the peaceful world order of his dreams was nowhere in
sight. Nationalism and autocracy were on the rise and democracy was
under attack in some of the most democratic countries on earth,
including the United States."

President [Trump's latest dismissal of human rights as a matter of
interest will be welcomed not only by the Saudi Kingdom but by
authoritarian regimes around the world.]{.underline} **[Buy enough arms
and pledge to invest enough in the United States and the Trump
Administration will turn a blind eye to gross human rights
abuses.]{.underline}** Human rights defenders, by contrast, will feel
abandoned. They need and deserve the support of the United States and
that of other democracies. [American leadership]{.underline}, hard to
envision right now, [must be restored to carry on this indispensable
mission.]{.underline}

Regime Formation

[U.S. treatment of international law also has consequences for regime
formation and norm diffusion. International regimes may form more
readily under the leadership of a hegemon able to coax (or coerce)
others to join and continue to cooperate over time]{.underline} (Keohane
1984). [**When the hegemon is uninterested in or actively opposes
cooperation, the prospects for regime formation are uncertain**. Some
scholars cast grave doubt on regime creation without a willing hegemon
acting in its own material interest to facilitate interstate
cooperation]{.underline} (Krasner 1983). Others counter that the
landmine treaty formed in the hands of middlepower leadership and
succeeded without bending to U.S. preferences. In the case of
"responsible" arms export controls, U.S. opposition until late 2009 both
helped and hindered regime formation and norm diffusion.

[Certainly, **the absence of one of the most powerful players in the
creation of an international regime might cast doubt on that regime's
legitimacy**]{.underline} (Franck 1990), [and opposition from any state
will stall cooperation when institutional rules require consensus. Lead
states]{.underline} and NGOs have made a particular effort to
[accommodate U.S. "red lines," hoping to create a treaty that covers a
signifi cant portion of the global arms trade by including the United
States. In doing so, they simultaneously increase the fi nal product's
legitimacy but weaken its contents.]{.underline} 15 Yet despite initial
U.S. opposition and in part because of U.S. opposition, lead states were
able to initiate the process to form a legally binding regime. In fact,
when the hegemon's reputation is damaged, its opposition may not be
wholly detrimental to regime formation. The opportunity to "look better"
than (or not as bad as) the United States has helped garner support for
(and lessen opposition to) shared arms transfer controls. [The negative
perception of a hegemon by a majority of states for eschewing its social
obligations may therefore provide an opportunity for others to advance
their social standing by behaving "better" than the most prominent
objector.]{.underline}

Although the ATT process was pushed forward by U.S. opposition, it
nevertheless entered a holding pattern without U.S. support---or at
least had to decide how to move forward without U.S. support. [This
suggests that the conditions under which regime formation may occur and
the outcome itself may still be circumscribed in the face of hegemonic
opposition]{.underline}. Leaders reduced the scope of the ATT---by
excluding regulations on transfers to nonstate actors, ammunition, and
civilian possession---simply to keep the U.S. engaged in the process and
in hopes of its eventually coming on board. And even as U.S. support in
late 2009 catalyzed formal negotiations, behind the scenes the United
States sought to maintain the more limited treaty scope and create some
wiggle room in the language of treaty obligations.

The strength of changed expectations for "responsible" policy choices
may affect lead states' ability to rally a critical mass of supporters
in addition to the hegemon's reputation. [When consensus over norms
becomes more widely diffused through regional initiatives and UN
discussions,]{.underline} 16 [these conditions can work together to the
regime leaders' advantage: the hegemon's reputation will visibly suffer
as a result of its opposition, and other states will perceive greater
social obligations and reputational consequences linked to their own
policy choices.]{.underline} The social pressures to cooperate therefore
may be strong even when the hegemon does not contribute to them. If the
spread of new norms becomes truncated, however, lead states may have
diffi culty inspiring cooperation in the absence of hegemonic support.

### AT: LIO Bad Turns -- Top Level

#### The liberal order is good---the alternative is great power conflict over overlapping spheres of Influence. 

**Kagan, 18** \-\-- senior fellow at the Brookings Institution (9/28/18,
Robert, "The World America Made---and Trump Wants to Unmake; The
U.S.-led global order created peace and prosperity for millions. So why
are the president's critics teaming up with him to tear it apart?"

accessed on 6/28/19, Dhruv)

So, yes, [the liberal order has been flawed]{.underline}, with its share
of failure and hypocrisy. Liberal goals have sometimes been pursued by
illiberal means. Power, coercion and violence have played a big part.
The order has been the product of American hegemony and it has also
served to reinforce that hegemony. But to note these facts is hardly to
condemn the order. No order of any kind can exist without some element
of hegemony. The Roman order was based on the hegemony of Rome; the
British order of the 18th and 19th centuries was based on the hegemony
of the Royal Navy; such order as existed briefly in Europe after the
defeat of Napoleon---the so-called Concert of Europe---rested on the
collective hegemony of the four victorious great powers. The idea of a
peaceful, stable multipolar world where no power or powers enjoy
predominance is a dream that exists only in the minds of one-world
idealists and international relations theorists.

The same is true of those who would condemn the liberal world order
because of the persistence of violence, coercion, hypocrisy,
selfishness, stupidity and all the other evils and foibles endemic to
human nature. [Perhaps in the confines of academia it is possible to
imagine a system of international relations where our deeply flawed
humanness is removed from the equation]{.underline}. **[But in the real
world, even the best and most moral of international arrangements are
going to have their dark, immoral aspects.]{.underline}**

[The question is, as always, compared to what?]{.underline} Patrick
Porter, the author of a widely discussed critique of the liberal world
order, acknowledges that "if there was to be a superpower emerging from
the rubble of world war in midcentury, [we should be grateful it was the
United States, given the totalitarian alternatives on
offer]{.underline}. **[Under America's aegis, there were islands of
liberty where prosperous markets and democracies grew."]{.underline}**
Indeed, that would seem to be the key point. At any given time [there
are only so many alternatives, and usually the choice is between the bad
and the worse.]{.underline}

Are the alternatives on offer so much better now? Graham Allison,
dismissing any return to the "imagined past" when the United States
shaped an international liberal order, proposes that we instead make the
world "safe for diversity" and accommodate ourselves to "the reality
that other countries have contrary views about governance and seek to
establish their own international orders governed by their own rules."
[Others]{.underline}, such as Peter Beinart, similarly [argue that we
should accommodate Russian and Chinese demands for their own spheres of
interest]{.underline}, even if that entails the sacrifice of sovereign
peoples such as Ukrainians and Taiwanese. [This wonderfully diverse
world would presumably be run]{.underline} partly [by Xi]{.underline}
Jinping, partly by Vladimir [Putin]{.underline}, and partly, too, by the
Ayatollah [Khamenei]{.underline} [and]{.underline} by [Kim]{.underline}
Jong Un, [who]{.underline} would also like to [establish orders governed
by their own rules]{.underline}. We have not enjoyed such diversity
since the world was run partly by Hitler, Stalin and Mussolini.

[The idea that this is the solution to our problems is
laughable.]{.underline} Porter points out American policy has led to
"multiplying foreign conflicts" and put the United States "on a
collision course with rivals." Setting aside the fact that
**[multiplying foreign conflicts and collisions between rivals is the
natural state of international relations]{.underline}** in any era, [it
is hard]{.underline} for any student of history [to imagine that these
problems would lessen if]{.underline} only [we returned to the
competitive multipolar world]{.underline} of the 19th and early 20th
centuries. [To suggest that there could be a world with no collisions
and no foreign conflicts, if only the United States would pursue an
intelligent policy, is the very opposite of realism]{.underline}.

Strikingly absent from all these critiques of the liberal world order,
too, is any suggestion of an alternative approach. The critiques end
with lists of questions that need to be answered. Allison calls for a
"surge of strategic thinking." Others call for "new thinking" about
"difficult trade-offs." Some critics even complain that so long as
people continue to talk about a U.S.-dominated liberal order, it will be
"impossible for us to construct a reasonable alternative for the
future."

The most the critiques will offer are suggestions that sound more like
attitudes than policies. They throw around words like "realism,"
"restraint" and "retrenchment." Allison proposes that the United States
"limit its efforts to ensuring sufficient order abroad." Beinart comes
closest to offering an alternative, but he clearly has not yet thought
it through fully. He wants to grant other powers their spheres of
interest, for instance, but he mentions only Russia and China. [Does
this mean Russia should be granted full sway in, say, Ukraine, the
Balkans, the Baltics and the Caucuses? Should China be able to impose
its will on the Philippines and Vietnam]{.underline}?

And what of the other great powers? [Does Japan get its own sphere of
interest? Does India? Do Germany, France and Britain? They all had their
spheres a century ag]{.underline}o, and of course **[it was the clashes
over those inevitably overlapping spheres that led to all the great
wars]{.underline}**. Is Beinart suggesting we should return to that
past?

Of course, we may be moving toward that world, anyway. That is the
implication of Trump's "America First" foreign policy philosophy, his
attacks on "globalism" and his recent suggestion that all nations look
out strictly for themselves. [Trump's]{.underline} speech at the U.N.
was an invitation to global anarchy, a struggle of all against all. His
[boasting about American power put the world on notice that the United
States was turning from supporter of a liberal order to rogue
superpower.]{.underline} [This breakdown may be our future, but it seems
odd to choose that course as a deliberate strategy,]{.underline} as
Allison and others seem to do. Little wonder that they don't wish to
spell out the details of their alternative but prefer to carp at the
inevitable failures and imperfections of the liberal world we have. As
John Hay once remarked, "Our good friends are wiser when they abuse us
for what we do, than when they try to say what ought to be done."

No honest person would deny that [the liberal world order has been
flawed and will continue to be flawed]{.underline} in the future. [The
League of Nations was also flawed]{.underline}, as was Woodrow Wilson's
vision of collective security. [Yet the world would have been better had
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[joined in upholding it, given the genuine alternative.]{.underline} The
enduring truth about **[the liberal world order]{.underline}** is that,
like Churchill's comment about democracy, it is **[the worst
system---except for all the others]{.underline}**.

#### Multipolarity is inevitable, but only sustained US leadership can avert a violent transition to regional power blocs and failed cooperation 

**Lissner & Rapp-Hooper 18** (Rebecca Friedman, PhD Candidate in the
Government Department at Georgetown University and an International
Security Studies, and \*Mira Rapp-Hooper, PhD, Adjunct Senior Fellow
with the Asia-Pacific Security Program at CNAS, "The Liberal Order Is
More Than a Myth," July 31,

Granted, the phrase "liberal international order" has always been
shorthand for U.S. global leadership---a structure sustained by American
power in service of largely Western preferences. As the most powerful
state in the system, the United States has disproportionately shaped its
rules while reserving the right to periodically flout them. But
acknowledging this relationship does not imply that the international
liberal system order is purely a reflection of raw power. Even as the
U.S.-Soviet Cold War rivalry emerged from bipolarity, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' [embrace of liberal
internationalism guided its approach to international institutions and
structured cooperation within the Western bloc]{.underline}. Unrivaled
in the unipolar moment, [U.S. grand strategy has been more remarkable
for its restraint than its unfettered exercise of coercive power,
despite]{.underline} a slew of [regrettable excesses]{.underline}.
Indeed, the concept of [international order is]{.underline} relevant
even in a hard power world precisely because it is [not reducible to
unilateral U.S. interests or to the global distribution of military and
economic might. Rather, it emerged and endured through many states'
collective efforts]{.underline}. [Where rules are institutionalized in
organizations or legal regimes, they reflect painstaking diplomatic
efforts to identify convergent interests and codify standards of state
behavior]{.underline}. Where [rules]{.underline} develop organically, in
norms or customary law, they [reflect **decades** of **strategic
interaction**, during which repeated patterns of conflict and
cooperation have generated **predictability**]{.underline}. By design,
[the U.S.-led liberal system incorporated such attributes. As a result,
it offered]{.underline} both **[stability]{.underline}** and
considerable political, economic, **[and security]{.underline}** gains
to other states. [When]{.underline} Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Japanese Premier Shinzo Abe,
and other [U.S. allies invoke the]{.underline} beleaguered [liberal
order]{.underline} today, [it is because they want to **preserve those
advantages**]{.underline}. [Far from dismissing the order as
a]{.underline} mere [euphemism for U.S. hegemony, they see their own
national interests at stake]{.underline} in it. They also recognize that
[those interests cannot be protected without a]{.underline}
powerful---and [committed]{.underline}---[U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. Even China, the order's most formidable
challenger-in-waiting, finds value in selectively embracing its tenets.
THE COMING ENTROPY? [The liberal international order is a useful frame
for understanding the contours and endurance of U.S. grand
strategy]{.underline} over the past 70 years, but it will not persist
immutably for another seven decades. Never having achieved the universal
acceptance to which post--Cold War triumphalists aspired, [the present
order is threatened by adverse shifts in the balance of power: **China
is revisionist in its ascent**, and **Russia is revanchist in its
decline**]{.underline}. Global influence is shifting eastward, pushing
the United States and Europe into second place. [The formal and informal
arrangements that govern interstate interaction]{.underline}---which is
to say, the international order---[must adapt to this new reality if it
is to avoid abject decay]{.underline}. But changing power balances alone
do not make the order's demise a foregone conclusion. [For the next
several decades, the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will
still remain the world's most powerful state in military, economic, and
diplomatic terms]{.underline}. [No other country will have the same
capacity to shape international order]{.underline}, even as Washington
will wield its authority on fundamentally different terms. Put
differently, [**the twilight of the unipolar moment is not the same as
the end of U.S. global leadership or preeminence**. Given this, how the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [adapts its grand
strategy]{.underline} to domestic turmoil and considerable flux abroad
[will matter a great deal for the future of global order.]{.underline}
Other states, chief among them [China, will cement their own power in
regional and global rules and institutions]{.underline}. This trend is
well under way, and some aspects of it are nonthreatening, such as when
Beijing requests a greater voting share at the International Monetary
Fund. Elsewhere, however, [Beijing is fashioning new institutions
governed by rules that are decidedly illiberal]{.underline}, as with its
Belt and Road Initiative. [It would be a grave mistake for the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to abandon]{.underline} the
idea of [international order as an empty grand strategic ambition and
settle for regional influence]{.underline} over its own neighborhood.
[**Spheres of influence**]{.underline} are a form of balance-of-power
order but **[have historically been]{.underline}** a **[fundamentally
less stable]{.underline}** one and would certainly degrade U.S. security
and prosperity. [**Instead of letting rivals carve out spheres of
influence**, the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [needs a novel
grand strategic vision that **rejects both** radical retreat and
creativity-numbing nostalgia]{.underline}. [Any new approach must
account for rapidly shifting power relations and technological
change]{.underline}. It should also reflect more critically on the
universalist ambitions of post--Cold War U.S. grand strategy and may
require a greater tolerance for regime diversity than liberal
triumphalists could have possibly imagined at the apex of U.S. power.
For the United States to lead abroad, it must also confront the
dysfunction that is hollowing out support for internationalism at home.
As we have argued, and as Allison rightly points out, Trump may be more
avatar than architect of the United States' domestic unraveling. To be
sure, [**Trump's transactional and visceral approach to foreign policy
is**]{.underline} itself [**wreaking havoc on the predictability
underlying the postwar order**]{.underline} and will require global
recompense of epochal proportions from any new leader. But we cannot
assess the extent or endurance of his destructiveness just 18 months
into his term. What we do know is that Trump's victory was not an
isolated political shock---a fact that many analysts miss by fixating on
Trump's heterodox administration and anticipating his eventual exit. In
some ways, Trump's policies are merely a modern projection of old
impulses, most notably the deep unilateralism of the Jacksonian school
of foreign policy. Trump's contemporary version, however, rests on
populist and nativist impulses activated in part by socioeconomic
dislocation that will only intensify. Automation and the changing nature
of work, inequality, political and media polarization, and demographic
changes are likely to intersect with an increasingly turbulent
international environment, making it more difficult still to articulate
a coherent foreign policy built around age-old liberal values and
institutions. These domestic undercurrents must be faced squarely---not
only for the sake of restoring a sustainable U.S. social compact but in
order to build a consensus on the United States' role in the world. NEW
ORDER Less than halfway through Trump's first term, the U.S. foreign
policy establishment, cut off from the levers of power, watches in a
state of shock as the country stumbles from one international indignity
to another. But the domestic and international forces that carried Trump
to power will accelerate with his presidency and outlast his tenure. The
United States, in other words, is only just commencing a strategic
reckoning, the likes of which it has not undertaken since the years
immediately following World War II. In the new strategic environment,
[the old liberal order built on unrivaled U.S. power will no doubt
prove]{.underline} obsolete and [untenable]{.underline}. **[But that
should not imply giving up on the system
altogether]{.underline}**---[particularly since it has advanced U.S.
interests at a lower cost than any known alternative]{.underline}. As in
previous eras, the United States' global power position will condition,
but not predetermine, Washington's strategic choices. In this process of
reorientation, domestic renewal and international restoration are not,
as Allison suggests, mutually exclusive. In fact, they are complements,
and any serious reevaluation of U.S. strategy must address them
simultaneously. The liberal international order may be less foundational
than often argued, but it serves more than just narrative purposes. In
its hour of duress, a new vision for [U.S. strategy must assess
threats]{.underline} and advantages at home and [abroad and adapt the
institutions that have been the foundation of American
power]{.underline}. [If successful, the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [will navigate an epoch of disruptive change, both
domestic and international, in a manner that is peaceful and redounds to
U.S. interests]{.underline}. It is a formidable task to be sure, but
this moment demands no less.

#### Criticisms of the liberal order are incorrect \-\-- it causes economic prosperity, prevents great power conflict, and reduces a myriad of human rights violations. 

**Brands, 18** \-\-- Henry Kissinger Distinguished Professor at Johns
Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies (8/14/18,
Hal, "America's Global Order Is Worth Fighting For; The longest period
of great-power peace in modern history is not a "myth."

accessed on 6/28/19, Dhruv)

Yet because there have always been authoritarian powers that do not
share this vision, the liberal order is backstopped by hard-power tools,
such as America's unparalleled military capabilities and global network
of alliances.

The liberal order, then, simply reflects America's effort to forge a
world conducive to its own interests and values. [Between 1945 and 2017,
every U.S. president was committed ---]{.underline} albeit to varying
degrees and in varying ways [--- to that ambitious project]{.underline},
which gradually expanded over time.

[Today]{.underline}, however, [the system is facing
challenges]{.underline}, [and not just from a president who clearly
dislikes both economic and political liberalism]{.underline} and the
outsized role that the U.S. has typically played in sustaining global
order.

[It is also under fire from foreign policy mandarins who]{.underline}
level three strong [critique]{.underline}s against [the liberal order
and its proponents]{.underline}.

First, the **[critics argue that the accomplishments of the liberal
order are overstated]{.underline}** --- and even, as Harvard's Graham
Allison puts it, that the order itself is a "myth." Second, [they
contend that the U.S. was never really committed to anything beyond the
promotion of its own narrow interests, and they highlight]{.underline}
--- in the phasing of the University of Chicago's Paul Staniland ---
["how coercive, violent, and hypocritical U.S. foreign policy has often
been.]{.underline}" Third, [they contend that Washington would be better
off]{.underline} foregoing "teary-eyed nostalgia," as the historian and
retired Army colonel Andrew Bacevich writes, and [embracing the
inevitable transition to a different and less U.S.-centric
world.]{.underline}

The first argument is easily disposed of. [Yes, the postwar world has
been]{.underline} thoroughly [imperfect]{.underline}, featuring nuclear
arms races, genocides, widespread poverty and other scourges. [But the
world has always been imperfect, and by any meaningful comparison, **the
last seven decades have been a veritable golden age.**]{.underline}

[**The liberal international economic order has led to an explosion of
domestic and global prosperity**:]{.underline} [According to World Bank
data, both U.S. and global per capita income have increased roughly
three-fold]{.underline} (in inflation-adjusted terms) [since
1960,]{.underline} with U.S. gross domestic product increasing nearly
six-fold. [The U.S. system of alliances and forward military deployments
has contributed]{.underline} critically to **[the longest period of
great-power peace in modern history]{.underline}**, [and the incidence
of war and conquest more broadly have dropped dramatically]{.underline}.
[The number of democracies in the world has increased from perhaps a
dozen during World War II to well over 100 today]{.underline}; [respect
for basic human rights has also reached impressive levels.]{.underline}

As a bevy of scholarship has shown, **[the policies that the U.S. has
pursued and the international order it has built have contributed
enormously and directly to these outcomes]{.underline}**. If the liberal
international order can't be considered a smashing success, no
international order could be.

The second critique is also overstated. [It is true that Washington,
like all great powers]{.underline} throughout history, [has been willing
to bend the rules to get its way.]{.underline} It is hard to reconcile
Cold War-era interventions in Guatemala, Chile and other countries with
a professed solicitude for human rights and democracy; the Iraq War of
2003 is only one instance in which the U.S. brushed aside the concerns
of international organizations such as the U.N. Security Council.
Likewise, when the U.S. government determined that the Bretton Woods
system of monetary relations no longer suited its interests in the
1970s, it terminated that scheme and insisted on creating a more
favorable one.

But again, [the proper standard here is not sainthood but
reality]{.underline}. And the U.S. has generally enlisted its power in
the service of universal values such as democracy and human rights; [it
has,]{.underline} more often than not, [promoted a positive-sum
international system in which like-minded nations can be secure and
wealthy.]{.underline} This goes back to the very beginning of the
liberal order: [Washington did not seek to hold its defeated adversaries
in subjugation after World War II; it rebuilt Japan and western Germany
into thriving, democratic allies]{.underline} that became fierce
economic competitors to the U.S.

[The U.S. has taken this approach]{.underline} not simply because it
wanted to do good in the world --- powerful as this motivation is ---
but [because of a hard-headed desire to do good for itself]{.underline}.
In an interdependent global environment, [American officials have long
calculated, the U.S. cannot divorce its own well-being from that of the
wider world.]{.underline} And **[in contrast to how other great powers
--- Imperial Japan, for instance, or the Soviet Union --- ruled their
spheres of influence, American behavior has been positively
enlightened]{.underline}**. It is this relatively benign behavior that
has convinced so many countries to tolerate American leadership --- and
[it is the emergence of a darker form of U.S. hegemony
under]{.underline} the [Trump]{.underline} administration [that so
profoundly worries them today.]{.underline}

As for the third critique, the premise is right but the conclusion can
easily go too far. It is always dangerous to become so enraptured by
past achievements that one loses sight of the need for adaptation in the
future. This is particularly true today, [because the strength of the
liberal order is being tested from]{.underline} within and without, by
issues ranging from [unequal burden-sharing among American allies
to]{.underline} the ambivalence of the [American people
themselves]{.underline}. [There is little evidence to
suggest]{.underline}, however, that either American power or [the
liberal order]{.underline} it supports [have eroded so dramatically that
Washington's postwar project cannot be sustained]{.underline}. Quite the
contrary --- the U.S. is likely to remain the world's strongest power
for decades to come.

This being the case, [the proper response to today's challenges
is]{.underline} not to abandon America's order-building project, but [to
refine it while recommitting to it.]{.underline} U.S. presidents have
done this before: In the 1970s, Richard Nixon renegotiated the terms of
the international monetary system, adjusted America's role in the
defense of Asia from communism, and opened new diplomatic relationships.
Yet he did all this to extend the lifespan of an international order
that was under strain. That's the sort of effort that is again required
--- and is what I'll address in greater detail in my next column.

### LIO Good -- Democracy / Heg 

#### Chinese-Russian revisionism will erode global democracy and US hegemony. 

**Brands 18** \-\-- PhD from Yale (Hal Brands is the Henry A. Kissinger
Distinguished Professor of Global Affairs at the Johns Hopkins School of
Advanced International Studies, and Senior Fellow at the Center for
Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, "Democracy vs Authoritarianism: How
Ideology Shapes Great-Power Conflict," Survival vol. 60 no. 5, Oct-Nov,
https://halbrands.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/60-5-07-Brands.pdf)

**\*Note -- also AT Democracy Promotion Bad**

Ideology has gotten a bad name in US foreign policy in recent years,
because it is often taken to signify a dogmatic adherence to faith in
the face of reality, or a commitment to dangerous, moralistic crusades.
[What would be truly dangerous]{.underline}, however, [would be to
ignore the unmistakable ideological content of contemporary great-power
rivalry]{.underline}. America's competitions with Russia and China are
not dry, value-free affairs. They are infused with the ideas, values and
proclivities that flow from the opposing systems of the competitors.
Grasping how ideological differences sharpen geopolitical antagonisms,
shape great-power strategies and influence the competitive strengths and
weaknesses of America and its rivals is thus critical to accurately
assessing the global challenges the United States confronts. It also
highlights four additional points American policymakers should keep in
mind. Firstly, a focus on ideology reminds us that the stakes of today's
competitions are even higher than they might initially seem. [The
US--China and US--Russia rivalries would be deadly serious if they
concerned 'only' the future balance of power and influence. Yet they
have equally fundamental ramifications for the future ideological
balance between democracy and autocracy, liberalism and
illiberalism]{.underline}. [It is no coincidence that the global advance
of democracy seems to have stalled]{.underline}, and perhaps gone into
reverse, [at a time when resurgent authoritarian powers are challenging
a global order founded on America's liberal precepts]{.underline}.148
[Insofar as Russia and China succeed in further revising that order,
they will bring about a world that is not just **less amenable to US
influence**, but one that is **less hospitable to democratic
values**]{.underline}. [That]{.underline}, in turn, [could trigger a
**vicious cycle**: a world in which democracy is weaker might also be a
world in which it is harder for a liberal superpower to rally global
opposition to the depredations of illiberal rivals]{.underline}. [The
present competitions concern the fate of]{.underline} ideas as well as
the fate of [nations]{.underline}. To recognise that fact is to engage
not in melodrama but in simple realism. Secondly, understanding the
ideological components of great-power rivalry helps dispel certain
illusions about the ease of resolving those conflicts. Academics and
certain policymakers -- including President Trump -- have proposed
various 'grand bargains' that would dramatically reduce tensions between
Washington and its challengers by clearing away certain geopolitical
disputes that divide them.149 Let us leave aside, for a moment, whether
it would be wise to trade away Taiwan in hopes of gaining Chinese
restraint elsewhere, or to abandon Ukraine with an eye to purchasing
Russian cooperation on other issues. Leave aside, also, whether such
bargains would stay struck or simply encourage further revisionism. The
fact remains that today's competitions are so fraught because they are
not simply about clashing desires for geopolitical influence, but about
contradictory conceptions of governance, political values, even
morality. They involve fundamental questions about what sort of nations
America, Russia and China are, and what kind of world their political
nature leads them to envision. History suggests that such conflicts tend
to be protracted and inherently difficult to resolve.150 This is
certainly not to say that competitions with Russia and China are
struggles to the death, or that shrewd negotiation has no role to play
in managing tensions and even forging select areas of cooperation. But
it is a reminder that competitions combining geopolitical tensions with
ideological conflict often frustrate efforts at transcendent
diplomacy.151 Thirdly, if there is a pronounced ideological dimension of
great-power competition, then there should be a pronounced ideological
component of American strategy. US rivals are pushing for advantage in
the political and ideological spheres; to refrain from answering in kind
would be a form of unilateral disarmament. Limits are important here:
**[ideological competition need not entail actively promoting regime
change]{.underline}** in Russia or China, and there is room for debate
on precisely how forward-leaning the United States should be -- and what
tactics it should embrace or eschew -- in the ideological realm. [Yet
the robust defence and promotion of democratic values abroad should be a
key part of any comprehensive effort to shore up the liberal
international order against illiberal Russian and Chinese
challenges]{.underline}. The United States might also explore, with
appropriate caution and prudence, whether there are ways of manipulating
the domestic weaknesses of the Russian and Chinese systems for
geopolitical advantage, just as Moscow and Beijing are doing to
Washington today, and just as America did against the Soviet Union
during the Cold War. Indeed, if today's competitions are as encompassing
as recent US policy statements indicate, fighting back on all fronts
would seem warranted.152 Finally, [all of these considerations reinforce
the overriding strategic imperative that America remain true to the
better angels of its nature]{.underline}. All things being equal, the
United States is likely to enjoy great long-term advantages in today's
strategic competitions simply by virtue of being a liberal democracy.
Yet all things are not equal right now, because at the presidential
level, the United States seems to be practising an extraordinarily
abrasive, illiberal diplomacy that is eroding its alliances, spending
down its soft power and causing many international observers to wonder
whether American leadership is still less threatening than the
alternatives. So far, the other elements of the American foreign-policy
apparatus have done a decent job of containing the damage. The US
president clearly disdains America's democratic allies, for instance,
but day-to-day cooperation remains quite robust. Trump openly praises
dictators, but his Treasury Department has employed sanctions meant to
punish human-rights violators fairly vigorously.153 And as this quiet
campaign to contain the president indicates, some of the most troubling
aspects of Trump's diplomacy appear to have more to do with the
particular personal qualities of the president than with deeper
structural shifts in the way the United States approaches foreign
policy.154 It seems unlikely, then, that Trump's presidency -- as
diplomatically destructive as it has been -- represents a permanent move
toward a strategically illiberal America. Yet [Trump's
behaviour]{.underline} nonetheless [illuminates the fact
that]{.underline} individuals and [individual policy choices still
matter in the larger clash between rival systems.]{.underline} Trump's
approach does not represent 'smart' or 'tough' diplomacy. It is not what
the 'National Security Strategy' claims -- a more competitive and
effective approach to great-power relations. [The president's
conduct]{.underline}, rather, [is a recipe for devaluing]{.underline}
many of [the assets that have traditionally benefited a democratic
superpower, and]{.underline} thereby [weakening America's strategic
competitiveness]{.underline} for as long as Trump's ethos persists. At
the outset of another great-power competition, George Kennan argued that
the most important thing America could do was to 'measure up to its own
best traditions and prove itself worthy of preservation as a great
nation'.155 It was good advice then, and it is good advice now.

I disagree, though. [Yes, the United States has often been selective,
inconsistent and hypocritical in translating its espoused principles
into policy. But the liberal international order was neither a myth nor
an accident]{.underline}. [The broad thrust of U.S. policy, under 13
U.S. administrations before]{.underline} Donald [Trump, was to support
the gradual emergence of an open, rule-bound international system in
which all sovereign states could ultimately pursue shared peace,
prosperity and freedom]{.underline}.

[America's grand strategy of building a liberal world order explains
important aspects of postwar international history. One is why relations
were so harmonious between the massively powerful United States and
other Western market democracies; in earlier eras, they might well have
become geopolitical rivals. Another is why this period of U.S. global
dominance coincided with an extraordinary proliferation of international
institutions]{.underline}, which today help coordinate and regulate
interstate relations in virtually every conceivable sphere. [Ultimately,
support for a liberal international order is what distinguishes the
United States from the many leading world powers that preceded
it.]{.underline}

### LIO Good -- War / Economy

#### Breakdown of the liberal order ensures [global instability]{.underline} and [economic collapse]{.underline} -- every possible alternative is worse.

[The liberal world order]{.underline} established by the United States a
little over seven decades ago [is collapsing]{.underline}. This should
not be surprising. It was always a historical anomaly. The long period
of prosperity, widespread democracy and peace among the great powers was
a dramatic departure from the historical norm. It certainly was not
where the world had been heading before 1945. Less than [80 years ago,
liberalism outside North America was on its death bed]{.underline}.
[Dictatorships were thriving, the great powers were fighting their
second global conflagration]{.underline}, and acts of unspeakable
inhumanity were being committed in the very heart of Western
Judeo-Christian civilization and in the ancient civilizations of the
East. The very idea of progress seemed absurd. The dramatic change of
course after 1945 was not due to some sudden triumph of our better
angels or embrace of Enlightenment principles that had been around for
centuries, nor was it the natural unfolding of Universal History in the
direction of liberalism. Liberal ideals triumphed because, for the first
time, they had power behind them. A new player arose on the
international scene: the United States. It possessed a unique and
advantageous geography, a large, productive population, unprecedented
economic and military power, a national ideology based on liberal
principles, and a willingness, after the war, to use its power to
establish and sustain a global order roughly consistent with those
principles. That order---with its mutually reinforcing security,
economic and political components---has created a geographical and
geopolitical space in which liberalism has taken root, spread and
evolved. But it was always artificial and tenuous, challenged from
within and without by natural forces---the always potent antiliberal
aspects of human nature and the competitive and anarchic tendencies of
geopolitics. [Like a garden, it can last only so long as it is tended
and protected.]{.underline} Today, the U.S. seems bent on relinquishing
its duties in pushing back the jungle. Among the many complaints heard
now against the liberal order is that it was imposed by an often
oppressive, selfish, hypocritical and incompetent American hegemony. And
there is truth in that---the liberal order was erected and defended by
humans. But what, in the real world, was the better alternative? [The
world the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [confronted after
World War II had been on a steady course toward destruction]{.underline}
since the 19th century. [The rise of Germany and Japan, and]{.underline}
the relative [decline of Great Britain]{.underline}, had [produced
a]{.underline} seemingly [endless cycle of war in Europe]{.underline}
(1870, 1914, 1939) [and in East Asia]{.underline} (1894, 1904, 1914, and
1931-1945). [The global economy had broken down into protectionist
enclaves and become an arena for geopolitical competition.]{.underline}
Fascism and communism had been on the rise since the 1920s. Even after
the defeat of Germany and Japan, populations were devastated and
inclined to radical or authoritarian solutions. No one contemplating the
direction of history in those years put their money on the triumph of
either peace or liberalism. And [had the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates simply [gone home after World War II]{.underline},
as it did after World War I, [the old patterns would]{.underline} likely
[have persisted]{.underline}. Regretting their abstention in the
interwar years, Americans decided that they could no longer sit "in the
parlor with a loaded shotgun, waiting," as Secretary of State Dean
Acheson put it in 1950. Protecting what he called the "American
experiment of life" required creating "an environment of freedom" in the
world and deterring aggressors before they gained control of distant
continents. [The only guarantee of peace was "the continued moral,
military and economic power of the United States."]{.underline} America
would have to be "the locomotive at the head of mankind." [The
architects of the new order]{.underline} were not utopian idealists.
They [believed in]{.underline} the inherent sinfulness of humans, [the
competitiveness of nations and the tendency of all orders to
collapse]{.underline}. They had stared into the abyss and seen the
depths to which humankind could fall. They knew the world they created
would be flawed and costly to defend, but they believed **[an imperfect
liberal order was better than none at all]{.underline}**. We tend to
view the decades after 1945 through the lens of the Cold War, and Soviet
communism certainly preoccupied Americans. Yet the response to the
Soviet threat, which included the deployment of U.S. forces permanently
in both Europe and East Asia and the creation of the global alliance
structure, produced a geopolitical revolution. Within the confines of
that system, normal geopolitical competition all but ceased. [Nations
within the order]{.underline}, in Western Europe and East Asia, [didn't
compete with each for military superiority, form strategic alliances
against one another or claim spheres of influence]{.underline}. Since no
balance of power was necessary to preserve the peace among them, as it
always had been in the past, they could shift substantial resources and
energy from military to economic and social purposes. Today, some call
this "[free-riding]{.underline}," but that [misunderstands the
revolutionary transformation that proved essential to global peace and
prosperity]{.underline}. Historically, [Japanese and German economic
success]{.underline} had translated into military power and a challenge
to the geopolitical hierarchy. But after 1945, their economic miracles
simply [added to the strength of the liberal world order against
potential challengers]{.underline}, most notably the Soviet Union. The
liberal world order was not really "rules-based," as some say today, at
least not in military and strategic matters. The U.S. generally paid
little more than lip-service to the United Nations when it used force,
and often did not even consult with allies. Yet it did make substantial
concessions. At the heart of the order was a grand bargain: The other
liberal powers ceded strategic hegemony to the U.S., but in return the
U.S. would not use that hegemony to constrain their economic growth. It
could not insist on winning every transaction. There had to be a
relatively level playing field---at times even one that favored the
other liberal powers. The success of the order was critical to the
peaceful conclusion of the Cold War. The Soviets, deprived of
opportunities for geopolitical gain, saw themselves falling dangerously
behind economically, to the point where they ultimately sued for peace.
And yes, the success of the liberal order was accompanied by disasters
like the Vietnam War, and American policies were often misguided,
selfish, oppressive and resented. Nor in the end did Russia and China,
the two great powers outside the order, ever choose to join it except as
trading partners. Yet American hegemony was never so intolerable as to
drive other members out. On the contrary, nations banged on the door to
come in. [Participants]{.underline} in the order, then and now, [have
shared the implicit understanding that however flawed the American-led
liberal world order might be, **the realistic alternatives would almost
certainly be far worse**]{.underline}. Today many Americans seem to have
lost sight of that eminently realistic judgment, and this has happened,
unfortunately, just at the moment when the world is slipping back into
old patterns. Autocracy, not so long ago dismissed as an anachronism,
has shown a strength and resilience that Franklin Roosevelt's generation
would have recognized, while the democracies suffer from paralysis and
self-doubt, as they did in the 1930s. Advanced communications and
computing technologies, once thought to be forces for cooperation and
freedom, have been turned into weapons of illiberalism. [The globalized
economy]{.underline}, instead of producing convergence, [remains an
arena for great-power competition. Nationalism and tribalism are
re-emerging. Territorial aggression and obsessions with borders have
returned]{.underline}. In short, the forces of history and powerful
elements of human nature are bringing us back to where we were before
the U.S. took responsibility for global peace and the preservation of
liberalism. And Americans today are responding much as they did then.
Some still believe in the inevitable march of progress, putting their
faith in social and economic revolution. Others bid the liberal order
good riddance. On college campuses it is synonymous with imperialism and
white capitalist exploitation. In the White House and on the American
and European right, it is seen as an international elite conspiracy
working against the interests of ordinary people. And across the
political spectrum, there is broad agreement that American foreign
policy since the end of the Cold War has been a series of disasters.
This is said to include not just the Iraq and Afghan wars but also a
range of longstanding strategies and attitudes: supporting democracy
overseas, expanding NATO and regarding the U.S., hubristically, as the
world's "indispensable nation." None of this began with Donald Trump.
His "America First" is a pithier version of Barack Obama's call to focus
on "nation-building at home," and the policies of the two
administrations have more in common than either would like to admit. A
new "realism" is in vogue, best articulated by thinkers such as Barry
Posen and John Mearsheimer. It calls for paring back commitments in
Europe and Asia, pulling out of the Middle East and adopting a policy of
strategic "restraint." It is time to accept the world "as it is," not as
we might wish it to be. It all sounds so sensible. The problem is that,
[after decades of living within the protective bubble of the liberal
world order, we have forgotten what the world "as it is" looks
like]{.underline}. [To believe that the quarter-century after the Cold
War has been a disaster is to forget what disaster means in world
affairs.]{.underline} Which other quarter-century would we prefer? [The
first quarter of the 20th century included World War I and the birth
of]{.underline} communism and [fascism. The second saw the triumph of
Hitler and Stalin, the Ukrainian famine, the Holocaust, World War II
and]{.underline} the invention and use of [nuclear weapons]{.underline}.
Even the quarter-century beginning in 1950 included the Korean War, the
Vietnam War, three Arab-Israeli Wars and the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[Perhaps our biggest failure is our unwillingness to imagine that things
could look again as they did in the first half of the 20th century, with
a few besieged democracies hanging on in a world dominated by
dictatorships]{.underline}. **[Aggression was the norm
then]{.underline}**, not the exception, [and every weapon invented by
scientists was eventually put to use.]{.underline} It should be hard to
have a 1930s mentality today, since we know what happened next. But we
comfort ourselves that those past horrors cannot be repeated. [We see no
Hitlers or Stalins on the horizon, forgetting that our forebears did not
see them either]{.underline}. [Those ambitious tyrants rose to power at
a time when they faced few constraints: No nation or group of nations
was willing or able to sustain an international order]{.underline} of
any kind, much less one [that might resist them]{.underline}. Today [we
know]{.underline} that Vladimir [Putin has grand ambitions]{.underline}
but not yet the capacity to realize them. He reveres Stalin, but he is
not Stalin. What would a less constrained Putin do? [A Russia that
restored its Soviet and imperial borders would be a far different player
on the international scene]{.underline} than the Russia now confined
east of Ukraine and the Baltic nations. Today [a more powerful
China]{.underline}, with a new premier-for-life, [is moving away
from]{.underline} the [cautious foreign policies]{.underline} of the
Deng era. We cannot yet know what an even more powerful and less
constrained China will want or do as it expands its regional and global
influence, especially if it does so by military means. We should also
recall that the European peace established since the Cold War is less
than three decades old. Prior to World War II, wars in Europe were
brought on by a combination of growing nationalism, collapsing
democracies and global instability, all of which are visible today.
Those who oppose the American promotion of democracy abroad generally
have non-Western nations in mind, but let's not have too much faith in
the West. Few of Europe's democracies date back before World War II. It
was in the West that fascism and communism arose, and it is in the West
that democracy is at risk once again. [The emerging
consensus]{.underline} today [is]{.underline} that [the U.S. has been
doing too much]{.underline}. [But what if we have been doing too
little?]{.underline} [We wanted to believe that the course of history
was taking us away from the war, tyranny and destruction of the first
half of the 20th century, but it may be taking us back toward them,
absent some prodigious effort on our part to prevent such
regression]{.underline}. Those who call themselves realists today
suggest that we can do less in the world and get more out of it. It is a
lovely fiction. [Our real choice is between maintaining the liberal
world order,]{.underline} with all its moral and material costs, [or
letting it collapse and preparing for the **catastrophes**]{.underline}
that are likely to follow. [Nothing is determined, not the triumph of
liberalism or its defeat.]{.underline} As we have seen these past 70
years, [tremendous human progress and]{.underline} human [betterment are
possible even in a dangerous world]{.underline}. To know that the jungle
will always be there is not to despair of keeping it at bay, as we have
done more or less successfully for decades. But make no mistake: [The
liberal order is as precarious as it is precious]{.underline}. It needs
constant tending lest the jungle grow back and engulf us all.

contemporaries. Yet it was hard to miss the import of [Xi]{.underline}
Jinping['s]{.underline} [address]{.underline} to the 19th Congress of
the Chinese Communist Party in October [2017]{.underline}. Xi's
three-hour speech, the culmination of a congress that cleared the way
for him to remain China's ruler indefinitely, [offered the most explicit
statement to date that a rising China would no longer be content to hide
its capabilities and bide its time. Xi declared]{.underline} that [China
was ready to 'take centre stage in the world']{.underline} -- to seek
global influence commensurate with its growing power. [He]{.underline}
also [argued]{.underline} that [China]{.underline} now [represented a
successful alternative to]{.underline} the combination of [liberal
democracy and free markets]{.underline} espoused by the reigning
superpower, the United States. Because China had achieved great
prosperity and power through its model of authoritarian capitalism, it
offered 'a new option for other countries and nations who want to speed
up their development while preserving their independence'.1 Xi's
address, then, was not simply a declaration of geopolitical ambition. It
was a reminder that [modern great-power competition revolves around
clashes of ideologies and systems of government]{.underline} no less
than around clashes of national interests. Today, it verges on cliché to
observe that [great-power competition is back]{.underline} -- that
[resurgent rivalry between the most powerful states is once again a
defining feature of global politics]{.underline}. After a period of
historically low geopolitical tensions, [revisionist powers -- namely,
China and Russia -- are **increasingly testing** the liberal
international order]{.underline} created and led by the United States.2
From the Western Pacific to Eastern Europe, [they are seeking to carve
out privileged spheres of influence and dominate their strategic
peripheries]{.underline}. They are [contesting]{.underline} global
'rules of the road' such as [freedom of navigation and
non-aggression]{.underline}, [and using tools ranging from]{.underline}
inducement to [intimidation to military coercion to make the
international environment more receptive to their
ambitions]{.underline}. They are [competing for influence]{.underline}
in pivotal countries and regions across Eurasia; they are [probing the
vulnerable peripheries of US power]{.underline}. As all this occurs,
they are [coming into progressively sharper rivalry with Washington
and]{.underline} other [defenders of the]{.underline} post-Second World
War [international system]{.underline}. [Whether these intensifying
rivalries will ultimately climax in **great-power war** is]{.underline}
perhaps [the central question of twenty-first-century
geopolitics]{.underline}. But **[the era of deep great-power
peace]{.underline}** that followed the Cold War **[is undoubtedly
over]{.underline}**.3 Less widely appreciated, however, is the extent to
which [ideological competition]{.underline} -- tensions between the
ideas around which societies organise themselves, and between the forms
of government they adopt -- [is fuelling geopolitical
competition]{.underline}.4 **[States are not interchangeable billiard
balls]{.underline}**, distinguishable only by the level of power they
possess. The chief defender of the existing international order is a
liberal democracy that has traditionally sought to shape the global
environment in accordance with its ideological values as well as its
strategic interests. [The leading revisionists are autocracies that
practise]{.underline} a distinctly [authoritarian]{.underline} version
of [capitalism and see]{.underline} the advance of [liberal ideals as
a]{.underline}n existential [threat]{.underline} to their legitimacy and
power. These divergent approaches to governance and society are never
far from the surface in world politics. We may not be witnessing a new
cold war, in which two diametrically opposed, universalistic ideologies
square off in a contest to propagate themselves around the globe. But
[it is no coincidence that today's sharpest geopolitical conflicts break
down along ideological lines]{.underline}.

### LIO Good -- Genocide / Social Alternatives

[**Of all the geopolitical transformations confronting the liberal
democratic world these days, the one**]{.underline} for which **[we are
least prepared is the]{.underline}** ideological and strategic
**[resurgence of authoritarianism]{.underline}**. We are not used to
thinking of authoritarianism as a distinct worldview that offers a real
alternative to liberalism. Communism was an ideology --- and some
thought fascism was, as well --- that offered a comprehensive
understanding of human nature, politics, economics and governance to
shape the behavior and thought of all members of a society in every
aspect of their lives.

[We believed that]{.underline} "traditional" [autocratic governments
were devoid of grand theories about society]{.underline} and, for the
most part, left their people alone. Unlike communist governments, they
had no universalist pretensions, no anti-liberal "ideology" to export.
Though hostile to democracy at home, they did not care what happened
beyond their borders. They might even evolve into democracies
themselves, unlike the "totalitarian" communist states. [**We even got
used to regarding them as "friends**," as strategic allies]{.underline}
against the great radical challenges of the day: communism during the
Cold War, Islamist extremism today.

Like so many of the theories that became conventional wisdom during the
late 20th and early 21st centuries, however, this one was mistaken.
Today, **[authoritarianism has emerged as the greatest challenge facing
the liberal democratic world]{.underline}** --- a profound ideological,
as well as strategic, challenge. Or, more accurately, it has reemerged,
for authoritarianism has always posed the most potent and enduring
challenge to liberalism, since the birth of the liberal idea itself.
[Authoritarianism has now returned as a geopolitical force,
with]{.underline} strong [nations such as China and Russia championing
anti-liberalism as an alternative to]{.underline} a teetering [liberal
hegemony]{.underline}. [It has returned as an ideological force,
offering the]{.underline} age-old [critique of liberalism]{.underline},
and [just]{.underline} at the moment [when the liberal world is
suffering its greatest crisis of confidence]{.underline} since the
1930s. It has returned armed with new and hitherto unimaginable tools of
social control and disruption that are shoring up authoritarian rule at
home, spreading it abroad and reaching into the very heart of liberal
societies to undermine them from within.

Dawn of the struggle

We in the liberal world have yet to comprehend the magnitude and
coherence of the challenge. We do not know how to manage the new
technologies that put liberalism at a disadvantage in the struggle. Many
of us do not care to wage the struggle at all. Some find the
authoritarian critique of liberalism compelling; others value liberalism
too little to care if the world order that has sustained it survives. In
this new battle of ideas, we are disarmed, perhaps above all because we
have forgotten what is at stake.

We don't remember what life was like before the liberal idea. We imagine
it as a pre-ideological world with "traditional autocrats" worshiping
"traditional gods" who did not disturb "the habitual rhythms" of
people's everyday life, as Jeane Kirkpatrick, a former U.S. ambassador
to the United Nations, once put it. This is a fantasy. Traditional
society was ruled by powerful and pervasive beliefs about the cosmos,
about God and gods, about natural hierarchies and divine authorities,
about life and afterlife, that determined every aspect of people's
existence.

Average people had little control of their destiny. They were imprisoned
by the rigid hierarchies of traditional society --- maintained by brute
force when necessary --- that locked them into the station to which they
were born. Generations of peasants were virtual slaves to generations of
landowners. People were not free to think or believe as they wished,
including about the most vitally important questions in a religious age
--- the questions of salvation or damnation of themselves and their
loved ones. The shifting religious doctrines promulgated in Rome or
Wittenberg or London, on such matters as the meaning of the Eucharist,
were transmitted down to the smallest parishes. The humblest peasant
could be burned at the stake for deviating from orthodoxy. Anyone from
the lowest to the highest could be subjected to the most horrific
tortures and executions on the order of the king or the pope or their
functionaries. People may have been left to the "habitual rhythms" of
work and leisure, but their bodies and their souls were at the mercy of
their secular and spiritual rulers.

Only with the advent of Enlightenment liberalism did people begin to
believe that the individual conscience, as well as the individual's
body, should be inviolate and protected from the intrusions of state and
church. And from the moment the idea was born, it sparked the most
intense opposition. Not only did Enlightenment liberalism challenge
traditional hierarchies, but its rationalism also challenged the
traditional beliefs and social mores that had united communities over
the centuries. Its universalist understanding of human nature and the
primacy of the individual cut against traditional ties of race and tribe
--- and even of family.

The new revolutionary liberalism, therefore, never existed peacefully
side by side with traditional autocratic society. Traditional rulers and
societies fought back with an anti-liberal worldview --- an "ideology"
--- as potent and comprehensive as liberalism itself.
Counter-Enlightenment thinkers such as Joseph de Maistre condemned the
Enlightenment's extolling of the individual's will and desires,
insisting on "individual abnegation" in a well-ordered, hierarchical,
authoritarian society.

The autocracies of Russia, Austria and Prussia that crushed the French
Revolution during the early 19th century tried afterward to establish an
order to keep liberalism at bay. The Concert of Europe so admired today
by former secretary of state Henry Kissinger and other "realists" fought
and killed for divine-right absolutism, for the authority of the church,
for the "natural" hierarchy of society. Metternich's Austria and
Alexander I's Russia were the early prototypes of the modern police
state. They engaged in extensive censorship, closed universities,
maintained networks of spies to keep an eye on ordinary people, and
jailed, tortured and killed those suspected of fomenting liberal
revolution.

Nor did they limit their attacks against liberalism to their own lands.
They intervened with force to crush stirrings of liberalism in Spain,
Italy, Poland and the German principalities. Alexander I even
contemplated extending the anti-liberal campaign across the Atlantic, to
Spain's rebellious colonies, prompting President James Monroe to
proclaim his famous doctrine.

To 19th-century Americans, European authoritarianism was the great
ideological and strategic challenge of the era. The American republic
was born into a world dominated by great-power autocracies that viewed
its birth with alarm --- and with good reason. The American
revolutionaries founded their new nation on what, at the time, were
regarded as radical liberal principles, set forth most clearly by the
17th-century Enlightenment philosopher John Locke, that all humans were
endowed with "natural rights" and that government existed to protect
those rights. If it did not, the people had a right to overthrow it and,
in the words of the Declaration of Independence, to form a new
government "most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness."

Natural rights knew no race, class or religion. The founders did not
claim that Americans' rights derived from English political "culture"
and tradition. As Alexander Hamilton put it, the "sacred rights of
mankind" were not to be found among "parchments or musty records" but
were "written, as with a sunbeam . . . by the hand of the divinity
itself" and thus could never be "erased or obscured by mortal power."

We long ago lost sight of what a radical, revolutionary claim this was,
how it changed the way the whole world talked about rights and
governance, and how it undermined the legitimacy of all existing
governments. As David Ramsay, a contemporary 18th-century American
historian, put it: "In no age before, and in no other country, did man
ever possess an election of the kind of government, under which he would
choose to live." Little wonder, as John Quincy Adams later observed,
that the governments of Europe, the church, the "privileged orders," the
various "establishments" and "votaries of legitimacy" were "deeply
hostile" to the United States and earnestly hoped that this new
"dangerous nation" would soon collapse into civil war and destroy
itself, which it almost did.

The battle between liberalism and traditional authoritarianism was the
original ideological confrontation, and it remained the ideological
confrontation for another century and a half. The principles of
Enlightenment liberalism, as set forth in the Declaration of
Independence, were the core issue over which the Civil War was fought.
When the United States miraculously survived that war and emerged as a
great power in its own right in the late 19th century, the autocratic
challenge remained in the form of a Germany still ruled by
Hohenzollerns, a Russia still ruled by the czars, an Austria still ruled
by Habsburgs, a Turkey still ruled by Ottomans, and a Japan and China
still ruled by emperors.

The nadir of authoritarianism

Historians and political scientists long ago drained World War I of
ideological import. But for those who fought it, on both sides, it was
very much a war between liberalism and authoritarianism. For the British
and French, and eventually the Americans, it was a fight to defend what
British Prime Minister Herbert Asquith in 1914 called "the liberties of
Europe," by which he meant liberal Europe, against "militarism,"
"Prussianism" and autocracy. And Germans agreed. Steeped in the
Romantic, Counter-Enlightenment tradition, they regarded the
Anglo-Saxons as soulless materialists.

Germans exalted the primacy of the state and the community, the Volk,
the Kultur. When President Woodrow Wilson took the United States to war
in 1917 in the hope of making the world "safe for democracy," it was to
defend the liberal "Atlantic Community" against this coherent,
anti-liberal ideology backed by a German military machine of
unprecedented strength and efficiency. The rise after the war of two
even greater challenges to liberalism --- in the forms of Nazi Germany
and Imperial Japan --- marked the failure of that hope. Their defeat in
World War II gave it a new birth.

The end of that war marked the nadir of authoritarianism. All the
authoritarian great powers of the 19th and early 20th centuries had been
destroyed over the course of four decades --- czarist Russia, along with
the Habsburg, Ottoman, Chinese, Prussian, and later, German and Japanese
empires. They fell not because they lost some historic battle of ideas,
however. They lost actual battles. They were brought down by wars, or,
in the case of Russia, by an unlikely communist revolution that could
only have succeeded because of disastrous wartime experience.

Nor did communism defeat Nazism in World War II. Russian and U.S. armies
defeated German armies. The subsequent division of the world between a
liberal American superpower and a communist Soviet Union was also the
product of war. The old Russian empire was catapulted into an
unprecedented and, as it turned out, untenable position of global
influence. The Cold War was not a final showdown between the only
ideologies left for humanity to choose from. It was just the
confrontation of the moment.

It is not surprising that we saw communism as the greatest challenge
democracy could face. It had the power of the Soviet Union behind it,
while the authoritarians were weak pawns on the chessboard of the Cold
War. The goals and methods of the Bolsheviks, the terror and oppression
they employed to raze an entire economic and social order, seemed not
only uniquely pernicious but also irreversible. That was the key point
of Kirkpatrick's 1979 essay, "Dictatorships and Double Standards," in
which she laid out her famous doctrine of supporting "traditional
autocracies" in the struggle against "totalitarian" communism. While the
former could, over time, possibly make the transition to democracy, she
argued, there was "no instance of a revolutionary 'socialist' or
Communist society" making a transition to democracy.

The thesis turned out to be wrong, however: Communism was neither
unreformable nor irreversible. The fanatical utopianism of the
Marxist-Leninist project proved too much at odds with fundamental
elements of human nature, including the desire to amass wealth and
property as the fruits of one's labor. It could not easily survive in a
competitive world. Though, in different circumstances, it might have
lasted much longer, any transformation that required so much violence
and state repression was fighting an uphill battle.

Communism's other problem was, ironically, that its leaders chose to
compete on the same plane as liberalism: They measured success in
material terms. Soviet leaders promised to meet and surpass the West in
improving the standard of living of the average citizen. They failed,
and suffered a crisis of confidence about their ideology. When Mikhail
Gorbachev tried to reform the system by introducing elements of
political and economic liberalism, he inadvertently brought about its
demise. China adopted a state capitalist system without the political
reform. Both proved that communism was neither invincible nor
inadaptable.

The liberal democracies had overestimated the challenge of communism,
and they underestimated the challenge of traditional authoritarianism.
And this, too, was understandable. Throughout the years of the Cold War
and during the era of liberal dominance that followed, the world's
autocracies were too weak to challenge liberalism as they had before.
They struggled just to survive. The right-wing dictatorships that
depended on the United States for money and protection had to at least
pay lip service to liberal principles and norms, lest they lose that
support. Some held elections when pressed, provided space to "moderate"
political opponents and allowed liberal international nongovernmental
organizations to operate within their borders, monitoring their human
rights records, working with civil society and training political
parties --- all as a way of avoiding potentially fatal economic and
political ostracism.

As the scholars Yong Deng and Fei-Ling Wang have noted, even Chinese
leaders after the Tiananmen Square repression in 1989 lived in "constant
fear of being singled out and targeted" by the "international hierarchy
dominated by the United States and its democratic allies." The Chinese
toughed it out, but many autocrats in those decades did not make it. The
Philippines' Ferdinand Marcos, Chile's Augusto Pinochet, Haiti's
Jean-Claude Duvalier, Paraguay's Alfredo Stroessner, and the South
Korean military junta were all forced out by a Reagan administration
that had quickly abandoned the Kirkpatrick doctrine. Over the next
decade and a half, others followed. In 2003, 2004 and 2005, the
post-communist autocrats in Kyrgyzstan, Georgia and Ukraine all gave way
to liberal forces that had received training and support from liberal
nongovernmental organizations, which the dictators had permitted to
avoid alienating the liberal world.

The authoritarians' weakness reinforced the belief among liberal
democracies that ideological competition had ended with the fall of
communism. In the brief era of liberal hegemony that followed the end of
the Cold War, we did not worry, because we did not notice, as
authoritarianism gradually regained its power and its voice as
liberalism's most enduring and formidable challenge.

In Russia, for instance, we believed that communism had been defeated by
liberalism, and in a sense it was, but the winner in post-communist
Russia was not liberalism. The liberal experiment of the Boris Yeltsin
years proved too flawed and fragile, giving way almost immediately to
two types of anti-liberal forces: one, the remnants of the Soviet (and
czarist) police state, which the former KGB operative Vladimir Putin
reestablished and controlled; the other, a Russian nationalism and
traditionalism that the Bolsheviks had tried to crush but was
resurrected by Putin to provide a veneer of legitimacy to his autocratic
rule.

As Putin dismantled the weak liberal institutions of the 1990s, he
restored the czarist-era role of the Orthodox Church, promised strong
leadership of a traditional Russian kind, fought for "traditional"
values against LGBTQ rights and other gender-related issues, and exalted
Russia's special "Asiatic" character over its Western orientation. So
far, this has proved a durable formula --- Putin has already ruled
longer than many of the czars, and while a sharp economic downturn could
shake his hold on power, as it would any regime's, he has been in power
so long that many Russians can imagine no other leader.

The few autocracies that survived the era of liberal hegemony did so by
refusing to make concessions to liberal norms. Either they had the
strength and independence to weather liberal disapproval or they had
something the United States and its democratic allies needed --- or
thought they needed. The Chinese had both, which allowed them simply to
crush all liberal tendencies both inside and outside the ruling
oligarchy, and to make sure they stayed crushed --- even as China's
leadership made the tricky transition from Maoist communism to
authoritarian state capitalism. Most Arab dictatorships also survived,
either because they had oil or because, after the terrorist attacks of
Sept. 11, 2001, the United States returned to supporting allegedly
"friendly" autocrats against radical alternatives.

The examples of autocracies such as Russia and China successfully
resisting liberal pressures gave hope to others that the liberal storm
could be weathered. By the end of the 2000s, the era of autocrats
truckling to the liberal powers had come to an end. An authoritarian
"backlash" spread globally, from Egypt to Turkey to Venezuela to
Zimbabwe, as the remaining authoritarian regimes, following Putin's
example, began systematically restricting the space of civil society,
cutting it off from its foreign supporters, and curbing free expression
and independent media.

The pushback extended to international politics and institutions, as
well. For too long, as one Chinese official complained in 2008 at the
World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the liberal powers had
determined the evolution of international norms, increasingly
legitimizing intrusions into the domestic affairs of authoritarian
powers: "You Western countries, you decide the rules, you give the
grades, you say, 'You have been a bad boy.' " But that was over. The
authoritarian governments of Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and
Iran all worked to weaken liberalism's hold. Their different ideological
orientations, which Americans regard as all-important, did not make them
lose sight of their common interest as non-liberal states. The result,
as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov put it in 2007, was that, for
the first time in many years, there was real competition in "the market
of ideas" between different "value systems." The West had lost "its
monopoly on the globalization process."

[The authoritarians]{.underline} now [have regained their
confidence]{.underline} and found their voice in a way they have not
since 1942 and, just as was true in the decades before World War II,
**[the most powerful anti-liberal regimes "are no longer content simply
to contain democracy,"]{.underline}** as the editors of the Journal of
Democracy observed in 2016. **[The regimes now want to "roll it back by
reversing advances dating from the time of the democratic
surge."]{.underline}**

These authoritarians are succeeding, but not only because their states
are more powerful today than they have been in more than seven decades.
[Their anti-liberal critique is also powerful]{.underline}. It is not
just an excuse for strongman rule, though it is that, too. **[It is a
full-blown indictment of what many regard as the failings of liberal
society, and it has broad appeal.]{.underline}**

It has been decades since liberal democracies took this challenge
seriously. The end of the Cold War seemed like indisputable proof of the
correctness of the Enlightenment view --- the belief in inexorable
progress, both moral and scientific, toward the achievement of the
physical, spiritual and intellectual freedom of every individual.
History was "the progress of the consciousness of freedom," as Georg
Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel put it in 1830; or as Francis Fukuyama wrote in
"The End of History and the Last Man" in 1992, there were fundamental
processes at work dictating "a common evolutionary pattern for all human
societies --- in short, something like a Universal History of mankind in
the direction of liberal democracy."

The premise underlying these convictions was that all humans, at all
times, sought, above all, the recognition of their intrinsic worth as
individuals and protection against all the traditional threats to their
freedom, their lives and their dignity that came from state, church or
community.

This idea has generally been most popular in relatively good times. It
flourished during the late 19th and early 20th century before being
dashed by World War I, the rise of communism and fascism, and the
decline of democracy during the 1920s and 1930s. It flourished again
after the end of the Cold War. But it has always been an incomplete
description of human nature. Humans do not yearn only for freedom. They
also seek security --- not only physical security against attack but
also the security that comes from family, tribe, race and culture.
Often, people welcome a strong, charismatic leader who can provide that
kind of protection.

Liberalism has no particular answer to these needs. Though liberal
nations have at times produced strong, charismatic leaders, liberalism's
main purpose was never to provide the kind of security that people find
in tribe or family. It has been concerned with the security of the
individual and with treating all individuals equally regardless of where
they come from, what gods they worship, or who their parents are. And,
to some extent, this has come at the expense of the traditional bonds
that family, ethnicity and religion provide.

To exalt the rights of the individual is to weaken the authority of the
church and other authorities that presume to tell individuals what they
must believe and how they must behave. It weakens the traditional
hierarchies of birth and class, and even those of family and gender.
Liberalism, therefore, cannot help but threaten "traditional values" and
cultures. Those are maintained either by the power of traditional
authorities or by the pressures of the community and majority opinion.
But in a liberal state, the rights of the few, once recognized,
supersede the preferences of the many.

In Europe and the United States, this has meant the breakdown of white,
Christian cultural ascendancy as liberalism has progressively recognized
the rights of people of color; of Jews and Muslims; of gays and others
with sexual orientations frowned upon, if not forbidden, by the major
religions; and, more recently, of refugees and migrants. Liberalism is a
trade-off, and many have often been unhappy at what was lost and
unappreciative of what was gained.

Liberalism at war with itself

Liberalism has thus always been vulnerable to anti-liberal backlashes,
especially in times of upheaval and uncertainty. It faced such a
backlash in the years between the two world wars and during the global
economic depression. In 1940, liberal democracy looked to be on its last
legs; fascism seemed "the wave of the future," as Anne Morrow Lindbergh
wrote at the time.

Liberalism faces a backlash again in the present era of geopolitical,
economic and technological upheaval. In such times, many people focus on
liberalism's shortcomings, the things it does not provide and the things
it either weakens or destroys. The thing liberalism does provide ---
security of the individual's rights against the state and the community
--- is easily taken for granted or devalued. Even in the United States,
the one nation founded on the principle of universal rights, the public
has supported the restriction of rights in times of perceived emergency,
whether justified or not. In other nations where experience with liberal
democracy has been brief and shallow, and where nationalism is tied to
blood and soil, it seems almost inevitable that political forces would
emerge promising to defend tradition and culture and community against
the "tyranny" of liberal individualism.

That is the backlash mounting across the globe, and not only among the
increasingly powerful authoritarian governments of Russia and China, but
also within the liberal democratic world itself.

Hungary's Viktor Orban has been in the vanguard, proudly proclaiming his
"illiberalism" in standing up for his country's white, Christian culture
against the nonwhite, non-Christian migrants and their "cosmopolitan"
liberal protectors in Brussels, Berlin and other Western European
capitals. Recep Tayyip Erdogan has dismantled Turkey's liberal
institutions in the name of Islamic beliefs and traditions.

Within the democratic world, there are alliances forming across borders
to confront liberalism. In his 2018 book, "The Virtue of Nationalism,"
influential Israeli intellectual Yoram Hazony urged unified resistance
by all the "holdouts against universal liberalism," the Brexiteers, the
followers of Marine Le Pen in France and Geert Wilders in the
Netherlands, the Hindu nationalists of India, as well as the
increasingly nationalist and illiberal governments of Poland and Hungary
--- all those who, like Israel, "wish obstinately to defend their own
unique cause and perspective" against the "proponents of liberal
empire," by which he means the U.S.-led liberal-democratic order of the
past 70-plus years.

And, of course, the United States has been experiencing its own
anti-liberal backlash. Indeed, these days the anti-liberal critique is
so pervasive, at both ends of the political spectrum and in the most
energetic segments of both political parties, that there is scarcely an
old-style American liberal to be found. But regarding the authoritarian
resurgence that is altering the world today, the most significant
developments are occurring among the United States' conservatives. Just
as the American left once admired international communism as an opponent
of the capitalist system it deplored, a growing number of American
conservatives, including those in charge of U.S. foreign policy, find
themselves in sympathy with the resurgent authoritarians and proponents
of illiberalism.

The anti-liberal critique has always resonated with at least some
strains of American conservative thought. There has always been a
tension in American conservatism. As Post columnist George F. Will once
observed, the "severely individualistic values" and "atomizing social
dynamism" of liberal capitalism invariably conflict with the traditions
of community, church and other institutions that conservatives have
always valued. At times, some conservatives have questioned the "whole
concept of universal natural rights" and have sought to ground American
democracy in a particular cultural and political tradition. Instead of
defending the principles of the Declaration of Independence, they have
defended tradition against the destructive power of those principles.
This was a different idea of American nationalism, and it was inevitably
bound up with questions of religion, race and ethnicity, for it was
about preserving the ascendancy of a particular cultural and political
tradition which happened to be white, Anglo-Saxon and Protestant.

From the early 19th century onward, a consistent theme in American
history has been the fear that an Anglo-Saxon Protestant United States
was being threatened both from within and from without --- from within
by the calls for the liberation and enfranchisement of African
Americans, and from without by the influx of non-Anglo-Saxon,
non-Protestant immigrants from Ireland, from Japan and China, from
southern, eastern and central Europe, and later from Latin America and
the Middle East.

This remains a theme of modern conservatism. During the 1950s and 1960s,
Russell Kirk looked to the segregationist South as the essential pillar
on which the American republic rested, and believed that in these "times
of trouble" the South had "something to teach the modern world." William
F. Buckley Jr. criticized such "convulsive measures" as the 1954 Supreme
Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education because they did "violence
to the traditions of our system." When a mob of white students attacked
a young black woman who had been admitted to the University of Alabama
following a court order in 1956, Buckley criticized the courts for
declaring illegal "a whole set of deeply-rooted folkways and mores" and
argued that the "white community" was "entitled to take such measures"
as were necessary "to prevail, politically and culturally." Nor, he
wrote, could the nation get away with "feigning surprise" at the violent
reaction.

Authoritarians' sympathetic friends: American conservatives

In the decades since, it has sometimes been difficult to distinguish
between conservative efforts to protect political and cultural
traditions against the assaults of progressive liberalism on the one
hand, and the protection of white Christian ascendancy against the
demands of racial and ethnic and other minorities on the other. Today,
many in the United States --- mostly, but certainly not exclusively,
white Christians --- are once again defending themselves and their
"deeply-rooted folkways and mores" against decisions by U.S. courts
granting rights and preferences to minorities, to women, to the LGBTQ
community, to Muslims and other non-Christians, and to immigrants and
refugees. And perhaps again we should not "feign surprise" that they are
mounting a challenge to the liberalism in whose name this assault on
traditional customs and beliefs has been launched. The backlash
certainly played a part in the election of Donald Trump and continues to
roil the United States today.

Nor should we be surprised that there has been a foreign-policy
dimension to this backlash. Debates about U.S. foreign policy are also
debates about American identity. The 1920s combined rising white
nationalism, restrictive immigration policies and rising tariffs with a
foreign policy that repudiated "internationalism" as anti-American. The
"America First" movement in 1940 not only argued for keeping the United
States out of the war in Europe, but also took a sympathetic view of
German arguments for white supremacy.

Those views were suppressed during a war fought explicitly against
Nazism and its racial theories, and then during a Cold War waged against
communism. But when the Cold War ended, the old concerns about the
nation's social and cultural identity reemerged. The political scientist
Samuel P. Huntington, who once made the case for authoritarianism as a
necessary stage in "modernization," in his more advanced years worried
that the United States' Anglo-Saxon Protestant "identity" was being
swamped by liberalism in the form of "multiculturalism." He both
predicted and cautiously endorsed a new "white nativism," and it was
largely on these grounds that in his post-Cold War writings about a
"clash of civilizations," he urged Americans to pull back from the world
and tend to their own "Western" civilization.

There has always been an element of anti-Americanism in that strand of
conservatism, in the sense that it has stood in opposition to the
liberal Enlightenment essence of the American founding. Abraham Lincoln
wrote of this essence when he described the universal principles of the
Declaration of Independence as an "apple of gold" and the Union and the
Constitution as the "picture of silver," the frame erected around it. At
a time when many in both the South and the North were calling for a
conservative defense of a Constitution that enshrined slavery and white
supremacy, Lincoln insisted that neither the Constitution, nor even the
Union, were the ultimate guarantors of Americans' freedoms. It was the
universal principles of the Declaration that lay at the heart of free
government --- the "picture was made for the apple, not the apple for
the picture."

The Civil War vindicated that view on the field of battle, and ever
since, the story of the United States has been the continual expansion
of rights to more and more groups claiming them, as well as continual
resistance to that expansion. When conservatives object to this
historical reality, they may or may not be right in their objections,
but it is to America that they are objecting.

These days, some American conservatives find themselves in sympathy with
the world's staunchest anti-American leaders, precisely because those
leaders have raised the challenge to American liberalism. In 2013, Putin
warned that the "Euro-Atlantic countries" were "rejecting their roots,"
which included the "Christian values" that were the "basis of Western
civilization." They were "denying moral principles and all traditional
identities: national, cultural, religious, and even sexual."
Conservative commentator Patrick Buchanan responded by calling Putin the
voice of "conservatives, traditionalists and nationalists of all
continents and countries" who were standing up against "the cultural and
ideological imperialism of . . . a decadent West."

The conservative thinker and writer Christopher Caldwell recently
observed that the Russian leader is a "hero to populist conservatives
around the world" because he refuses to submit to the U.S.-dominated
liberal world order. If the polls are to be believed, the number of
favorable views of Putin has grown among Trump supporters. They are not
simply following their leader. As the political scientist M. Steven Fish
observes, Putin has positioned himself as the leader of the world's
"socially and culturally conservative" common folk against
"international liberal democracy." Orban in Hungary, the self-proclaimed
leader of "illiberalism" within the democratic world, is another hero to
some conservatives. Caldwell suggests that the avowedly anti-liberal
Christian democracy that Orban is trying to create in Hungary is the
sort of democracy that "prevailed in the United States 60 years ago,"
presumably before the courts began imposing liberal values and expanding
the rights of minority groups.

Political theorist Marc Plattner argues that the gravest threat to
liberal democracy today is that the "mainstream center-right parties" of
the liberal democratic world are being "captured by tendencies that are
indifferent or even hostile to liberal democracy." He does not mention
the United States, but the phenomenon he describes is clearly present
among American conservatives, and not just among the "alt-right."

Liberalism under attack at home, from both the left and the right

If such views were confined to a few intellectuals on the fringe of that
broad and variegated phenomenon we call American conservatism, it would
matter less. But such thinking can be found at the highest reaches of
the Trump administration, and it is shaping U.S. foreign policy today.
Last fall, President Trump declared to a rally of supporters, "You know
what I am? I'm a nationalist, okay? I'm a nationalist. Nationalist. Use
that word. Use that word."

In Brussels in December, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also made a case
for nationalism, insisting that "nothing can replace the nation-state as
the guarantor of democratic freedoms and national interests." The idea
echoes Hazony's book "The Virtue of Nationalism," which argues that true
democracy comes from nationalism, not liberalism. It was a nod to the
nationalists of Europe waging their crusade against the "liberal
imperialism" of the European Union. And, indeed, the Trump
administration has been openly putting its thumb on the scale in this
battle, seeking, as Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, put
it, to "empower" the conservative forces in Europe and Britain while
denigrating German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the mainstream liberal
parties on both the center-right and center-left.

Putin has also been aiding the illiberal nationalist movements in Europe
as a central part of his global political strategy. Many of the
movements have received funding from Russian sources, while the
mainstream parties --- or even those liberals not associated with a
mainstream party, such as French President Emmanuel Macron --- have been
the target of Russian disinformation campaigns on social media. During
the Cold War, when the Soviet Union also engaged in large, if now
quaintly archaic, disinformation efforts, the U.S. government poured
significant resources into combating them. Today, though we have mounted
the beginnings of a defense against foreign manipulation, we have made
little effort to respond to anti-liberal propaganda with our own defense
of liberalism.

That is not so surprising when liberalism itself is under attack at
home, from both the left and the right. Today, progressives continue to
regard liberal capitalism as deeply and perhaps irrevocably flawed and
call for socialism, just as they did during the Cold War. They decry the
"liberal world order," the international trade and financial regime, and
virtually all the liberal institutions established during World War II
and at the dawn of the Cold War.

And, just as they opposed responding to the Soviet communist challenge
--- whether through arms buildups, the strategy of containment or by
waging an ideological conflict on behalf of liberal democracy --- modern
progressives show little interest in taking on the challenge posed by
the authoritarian great powers and the world's other anti-liberal forces
if doing so would entail the exercise of U.S. power and influence. The
progressive left is more concerned about alleged U.S. "imperialism" than
about resisting authoritarianism in places such as Venezuela.

During the Cold War, the American left was outnumbered by the broad
coalition of conservatives and anti-communist liberals who, in their own
ways and for their own reasons, joined together to support
anti-communist containment and to make the case for the superiority of
liberal democratic capitalism over Soviet communism.

No such coalition has coalesced to oppose international authoritarianism
or to make the case for liberalism today. A broad alliance of strange
bedfellows stretching from the far right to self-described "realists" to
the progressive left wants the United States to abandon resistance to
rising authoritarian power. They would grant Russia and China the
spheres of influence they demand in Europe, Asia and elsewhere. They
would acquiesce in the world's new ideological "diversity." And they
would consign the democracies living in the shadow of the authoritarian
great powers to their hegemonic control.

**[As the Trump administration tilts toward anti-liberal
forces]{.underline}** in Europe and elsewhere, [most Americans appear
indifferent, at best.]{.underline} In contrast to their near-obsession
with communism during the Cold War, [they appear unconcerned by the
challenge of authoritarianism]{.underline}. And so, **[as the threat
mounts, America is disarmed]{.underline}**.

Much of the problem is simply intellectual. We look at the world today
and see a multisided struggle among various systems of governance, all
of which have their pluses and minuses, with some more suited to certain
political cultures than others. We have become lost in endless
categorizations, viewing each type of non-liberal government as unique
and unrelated to the others --- the illiberal democracy, the "liberal"
or "liberalizing" autocracy, the "competitive" and "hybrid"
authoritarianism. These different categories certainly describe the
myriad ways non-liberal societies may be governed. But in the most
fundamental way, all of this is beside the point.

By far, the most significant distinction today is a binary one: Nations
are either liberal, meaning that there are permanent institutions and
unchanging norms that protect the "unalienable" rights of individuals
against all who would infringe on those rights, whether the state or the
majority; or they are not liberal, in which case there is nothing built
into the system and respected by the government and the governed alike
that prevents the state or the majority from violating or taking away
individuals' rights whenever they choose, in ways both minor and severe.

The distinction may not have been as straightforward during the 18th and
19th centuries, when Britain and France had liberal institutions that
genuinely challenged and even curtailed the power of absolute
monarchies. But in today's world, there can be no liberalism without
democracy and no democracy without liberalism. Hungary's Orban may speak
of "illiberal" democracy, but he has systematically weakened the
institutions --- a free press, an independent judiciary, an open and
competitive political system --- on which democracy depends.

The new tools of oppression in the 'illiberal state'

We are too easily fooled by the half-measures of autocrats and would-be
autocrats. A ruler or a dominant majority may leave individuals alone
for periods of time, or they may limit their rights only in small ways,
or only on particular issues. But if they are not bound to protect
individuals in their rights to life, liberty and property --- and in
this vital respect, to treat all people as equals under the law --- then
the rights they permit are merely conditional. Rulers may find it
prudent, convenient or lucrative to allow people the free exercise of
some or most of their rights, but the moment circumstances change, the
rulers can do whatever they want.

The distinction is important because circumstances are changing. [For
the past seven-plus decades since the end of World War II and the
beginning of the U.S.-led liberal world order, authoritarian regimes
faced many disincentives to deprive their people of individual
rights.]{.underline} **[In a world dominated by liberal
powers]{.underline}** --- and [**above all, by the**
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates --- **[they had reason
to fear political and military punishments that could prove their
undoing,]{.underline}** and in many cases did. Regimes that went too far
often paid a price eventually, and particularly if they were aligned
with and dependent on the dominant liberal powers.

To take one example, South Korea's Park Chung-hee had thousands of
people brutally tortured and many killed during the 1960s and 1970s ---
not just suspected communists and democracy activists, but also those
simply overheard criticizing the government. That worked for a while to
keep the regime in power, but after Park was assassinated in 1979 and
the United States began pressing for reform, his successors decided to
rule with a somewhat lighter hand. Ultimately, they relinquished power
peacefully, after being effectively ordered to do so by Washington. This
gave rise to the idea that South Korea under Park had been a
"liberalizing" autocracy, when, in fact, it was an autocracy that
succumbed to external pressures, which limited its ability to fend off
domestic opposition.

Many dictatorships simply lacked the means to oppress masses of people
in ways that were both effective and affordable. If the only way to
control a population was to kill and torture everyone, that was not a
promising business model, even if a government did have the resources to
sustain such a practice, which most did not --- a lesson learned by the
Chinese under Mao Zedong. Better to try to control what people said and
thought, as well as frightening them with the consequences of incorrect
thinking.

But, for a variety of reasons, some were better at this "totalitarian"
form of control than others. The more-modern societies such as East
Germany's oppressed their people with scientific efficiency, but many
other authoritarian governments had neither the skill nor the resources
to control their populations as effectively. In the United States, we
deluded ourselves into believing that if authoritarian regimes were not
engaged in systematic brutal repression, it was because they were
"liberalizing"; they were often just incapable and were responding to
the disincentives in a world dominated by liberal powers.

But the structure of incentives and disincentives is now changing,
because the structure of power in the international system is changing.
When Orban celebrated the "illiberal state" a few years ago, he claimed
that he was only responding to the "great redistribution of global
financial, economic, commercial, political and military power that
became obvious in 2008."

Since the late 2000s, autocrats including Putin in Russia, Xi Jinping in
China and Abdel Fatah al-Sissi in Egypt have given up the pretense of
competitive elections or even collective leadership. Rigged elections
are no longer necessary to appease liberal powers that lack either the
will or the ability to complain. It has become common practice for
autocrats to make themselves "president for life," as Xi did a year ago
and as Sissi has begun to do in recent weeks. This throwing off the
mask, including by Sissi, a leader heavily dependent on and allegedly
friendly to the United States, shows how few of the old disincentives
remain, at least at the moment.

The incentive structure has changed within the liberal democratic world,
as well. Twenty years ago, when European and transatlantic liberalism
was stronger, Orban's illiberalism would not have been tolerated to the
degree it is today. His success is evidence of the retreat of liberalism
globally.

A fateful choice

The problem is not just the shifting global balance of power between
liberalism and anti-liberalism. The revolutions in communications
technologies, the Internet and social media, data collection and
artificial intelligence have reshaped the competition between liberalism
and anti-liberalism in ways that have only recently become clear, and
which do not bode well for liberalism.

Developments in China offer the clearest glimpse of the future. Through
the domination of cyberspace, the control of social media, the
collection and use of Big Data and artificial intelligence, the
government in Beijing has created a more sophisticated, all-encompassing
and efficient means of control over its people than Joseph Stalin, Adolf
Hitler or even

George Orwell could have imagined. What can be done through social media
and through the employment of artificial intelligence transcends even
the effective propaganda methods of the Nazis and the Soviet communists.
At least with old-fashioned propaganda, you knew where the message was
coming from and who was delivering it. Today, people's minds are shaped
by political forces harnessing information technologies and algorithms
of which they are not aware and delivering messages through their
Facebook pages, their Twitter accounts and their Google searches.

The Chinese government is rapidly acquiring the ability to know
everything about the country's massive population, collectively and
individually --- where they travel, whom they know, what they are saying
and to whom they are saying it. A "social-credit register" will enable
the government to reward and punish individuals in subtle, but
pervasive, ways. The genius of what democracy scholar Larry Diamond has
called this "postmodern totalitarianism" is that individuals will
"appear to be free to go about their daily lives" but, in fact, the
state will control and censor everything they see, while keeping track
of everything they say and do.

This revolutionary development erases whatever distinction may have
existed between "authoritarianism" and "totalitarianism." What autocrat
would not want to acquire this method of control? Instead of relying on
expensive armies and police engaged in open killing and brutality
against an angry and resentful population, an autocrat will now have a
cheaper, more subtle and more effective means of control. Recognizing
this demand, China is marketing the hardware and software of its
surveillance state system to current and would-be autocrats on almost
every continent.

Consequently, the binary distinction between liberal and non-liberal
governments is going to be all that matters. Whether a government is
liberal or non-liberal will determine how it deals with new
technologies, and there will be radical differences. Liberal governments
will have to struggle with the implications of these technologies for
individual rights --- and as we have already seen, it isn't easy. But
liberal democracies will approach the problem from the bedrock premise
that individual rights must be protected. The rights of private
companies to sell what they want will have to be balanced against the
rights of individuals to protect their own data. The need of government
to provide security by monitoring the communications of dangerous people
will have to be balanced against the right of individuals not to be
spied on by their government.

The problems that bedevil liberal democracies, however, are not problems
at all for non-liberal governments. Whether "authoritarian,"
"totalitarian," "liberal" autocracy or "illiberal" democracy, they do
not face the same dilemmas: All these governments, by definition, do not
have to respect the rights of individuals or corporations. Individuals
are not entitled to privacy, and there are no truly private companies.
As Diamond observed, there is "no enforceable wall of separation between
'private' companies and the party-state" in China. But the same is true
in Russia, where the majority of companies are owned by Putin and a
small loyal oligarchy; in Egypt, where they are owned by the military;
in Venezuela, where they are owned by a business and military mafia; and
in Turkey, where state capture of the economy has risen dramatically in
recent years.

Even in more open and still nominally democratic countries such as
Italy, India and Poland, not to mention Hungary, there is nothing to
stop leaders from gaining control of the main purveyors of social media.
As the political scientist Ronald J. Deibert has noted, the use of
social media to control, confuse, mislead and divide a public is just as
effective in the hands of anyone seeking power in a democracy as it is
for established authoritarians. Today, every autocracy in the world
demands that foreign companies locate their data-storage devices on its
national territory, where the government can hack into it and control
what goes out or in. But autocracies aren't the only ones making that
demand.

If it was always a bit of myth that traditional authoritarian
governments left individuals' private lives undisturbed, now we are
entering a world where privacy itself may become a myth. In such a
world, all non-liberal governments will tend toward becoming "postmodern
totalitarians." **[What we used to regard as the inevitable progress
toward democracy]{.underline}**, driven by economics and science, is
**[being turned on its head]{.underline}**. In non-liberal societies,
economics and science are leading toward the perfection of dictatorship.

If nothing else, **[that should make the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[reconsider the idea
of supporting "friendly" dictatorships.]{.underline}** It was always a
dubious proposition. As Elliott Abrams and others have recorded, the
Reagan administration, which came into office convinced by Kirkpatrick's
arguments for supporting "friendly" right-wing autocracies, soon
determined that this was a mistake. It turned out that **[the "friendly"
dictatorships were not actually friends at all]{.underline}**. [They
were radicalizing their societies deliberately. They were more intent on
crushing moderates and liberals than on eliminating radicals and
revolutionaries, and not least because they knew that the threat of
radical revolution kept the money and the weapons flowing from
Washington.]{.underline} The Reagan administration discovered that, in
the Philippines, South Korea, Chile, Paraguay and Haiti, the "friendly"
dictators were obstacles to democracy, not to communism.

Egypt's Hosni Mubarak played the game successfully for decades: He
suppressed the moderate opposition while allowing space for the Muslim
Brotherhood, knowing that the threat of a Brotherhood victory would keep
the Americans on his side. It worked until he lost control of society
--- resulting in the Brotherhood victory at the ballot box in 2012 that
his policies had helped make inevitable. **[That we have unlearned this
very recent lesson and are once again looking to strongmen such as Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** and **[Egypt's
Sissi as allies is a testament to how difficult it is for convenient
myths to die.]{.underline}**

Today, we have even more powerful reasons not to support dictatorships,
even those we deem "friendly." The world is now being divided into two
sectors: one in which social media and data are controlled by
governments and citizens live in surveillance states; and one in which
individuals still have some protection against government abuse. And the
trend is clear --- the surveillance-state sector is expanding and the
protected space is shrinking. [The world's autocracies, even the
"friendly" ones, are acquiring the new methods and technologies
pioneered by Russia and China.]{.underline} And, as they do, they become
part of the global surveillance-state network. They are also enhancing
the power and reach of China and Russia, who by providing the technology
and expertise to operate the mechanisms of social control are gaining
access to this ever-expanding pool of data on everyone on the planet.

We have already seen how authoritarian manipulation of social media
transcends borders. Russia's Internet Research Agency, its bot farms,
state-sponsored trolls and sophisticated hacking have made Americans'
data and information space vulnerable --- along with the minds into
which that information is fed. A country such as Egypt may or may not be
an ally in the struggle against radical Islam, but in the struggle
between liberalism and autocratic anti-liberalism, Sissi's Egypt will be
on the other side.

Much more is at risk than our privacy. We [have been living with the
comforting myth that the great progress we have witnessed in human
behavior since the mid-20th century, the reductions in violence, in the
brutality of the state, in torture, in mass killing, cannot be
reversed]{.underline}. **[There can be no more holocausts; no more
genocides; no more Stalinist gulags.]{.underline}** We insist on
believing there is a new floor below which people and governments cannot
sink. But this is just another illusion born in the era that is now
passing.

[The enormous progress of the past seven-plus decades was not some
natural evolution of humanity]{.underline}; it **[was the product of
liberalism's unprecedented power and influence in the international
system]{.underline}**. Until the second half of the 20th century,
humanity was moving in the other direction. We err in thinking that the
horrors perpetrated against Ukrainians and Chinese during the 1930s, and
against Jews during the 1940s, were bizarre aberrations. Had World War
II produced a different set of victors, as it might have, such behavior
would have persisted as a regular feature of existence. It certainly has
persisted outside the liberal world in the postwar era --- in Cambodia
and Rwanda, in Sudan and the Balkans, in Syria and Myanmar.

[Even liberal nations are capable of atrocities, though they recoil at
them when discovered. Non-liberal nations do not recoil. Today, we need
only look to the concentration camps in China where more than 1 million
Muslim Uighurs are being subjected to mental and physical torture and
"re-education." **As authoritarian nations and the authoritarian idea
gain strength, there will be fewer and fewer barriers to what illiberal
governments can do to their people.**]{.underline}

We need to start imagining what it will be like to live in such a world,
even if the United States does not fall prey to these forces itself.
Just as during the 1930s, when realists such as Robert Taft assured
Americans that their lives would be undisturbed by the collapse of
democracy in Europe and the triumph of authoritarianism in Asia, so we
have realists today insisting that we pull back from confronting the
great authoritarian powers rising in Eurasia. President Franklin D.
Roosevelt's answer, that a world in which the United States was the
"lone island" of democratic liberalism would be a "shabby and dangerous
place to live in," went largely unheeded then and no doubt will go
largely unheeded again today.

To many these days, liberalism is just some hazy amalgam of idealisms,
to be saluted or scorned depending on whose ox is being gored. [Those
who have enjoyed the privileges of race and gender, who have been part
of a comfortable majority in shaping cultural and religious norms, are
turning away from liberalism as those privileges have become threatened
--- just as critics of liberal capitalism on the American left once
turned away from liberalism in the name of equality and justice and may
be doing so again. **They do so**]{.underline}, however, **[with an
unspoken faith that liberalism will continue to survive, that their
right to critique liberalism will be protected by the very liberalism
they are critiquing.]{.underline}**

Today, that confidence is misplaced, and one wonders whether Americans
would have the same attitude if they knew what it meant for them. We
seem to have lost sight of a simple and very practical reality: that
whatever we may think about the persistent problems of our lives, about
the appropriate balance between rights and traditions, between
prosperity and equality, between faith and reason, [only liberalism
ensures our right to hold and express those thoughts and to battle over
them in the public arena. **Liberalism is all that**]{.underline} keeps
us, and has [**ever kept us, from being burned at the stake for what we
believe**.]{.underline}

[**The liberal order led by the United States favored an open world
connected by the free flow of people, goods, ideas and capital, a world
grounded in the principles of self-determination and sovereignty** for
nations and basic rights for their citizens]{.underline}. It did fall
short of its ideals, often in Latin America and Southeast Asia. Yet
despite the hair-trigger tensions of the Cold War, it produced decades
of peace between the great powers while building shared prosperity.

[**The postwar order that America built now is facing acute
challenges**, including from old competitors]{.underline}. Russia's
president, Vladimir Putin, is no Stalin and Russia is no Soviet Union.
[But Mr. Putin does seek to recreate a Russian sphere of influence while
picking apart the liberal international order that prevailed in the Cold
War. China remains focused on stability at home, but the "new model of
great power relations" it has proposed to the United States would have
us stick to our side of the Pacific and let China play the pre-eminent
role on its side.]{.underline}

[America's allies in Europe and Asia]{.underline} are fixated on whether
the Donald Trump administration will reject the re-emergence of spheres
of influence or embrace them. They [worry that]{.underline}, in his
campaign, Mr. [**Trump seemed to approve of the "strong" leadership of
autocrats** and favor a transactional approach to Mr. Putin. He showed
little concern about Russia's cybermeddling in our election or
aggression in Ukraine while suggesting that NATO is "obsolete." He
argued that the United States should get out of the business of
"defending the world" and described Japan and South Korea as free riders
that should pick up the burden of their own defense and nuclear
deterrence.]{.underline}

He has promised to jettison the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade
agreement, ceding to China economic leadership and strategic influence
in Asia. For many Europeans and Asians, these proclamations translate
into a world in which the United States retreats into its cocoon, and
Russia and China dominate them in both political and economic spheres.

[**The United States must not see China or Russia through a zero-sum
prism**. The Obama administration has deepened areas of cooperation with
Beijing, from the Paris climate agreement, the handling of the Ebola
epidemic, the Iran nuclear deal and North Korea to joint projects in
developing countries.]{.underline} It negotiated the New Start nuclear
arms reduction treaty with Moscow and championed Russia's admission into
the World Trade Organization.

[**Yet when Russia or China challenge the principles of the liberal
international order, the United States must stand up to
them**.]{.underline} In Ukraine, Mr. Putin has sought to change the
borders of Russia's neighbor by force while denying its people the right
to decide with which countries, unions or alliances they associate. It
is why American support for Ukraine matters.

So does our resolute support for international law in the South China
Sea[. There, China's conduct in claiming vast territorial waters and
building military outposts on artificial islands risks undermining the
freedom of navigation and free flow of commerce upon which our
prosperity depends, the peaceful resolution of disputes that undergirds
stability and the rights of allies we have vowed to defend.]{.underline}

[**A sphere-of-influence world would not be peaceful or stable**; the
United States will not be immune to its violent disruptions. Hegemons
are rarely content with what they've got; the demand to expand their
zones as well as cycles of rebellion and repression within them will
lead to conflicts that draw us in.]{.underline} The United States would
have to accept permanent commercial disadvantage as economic spheres of
influence shut us out or incite a race to the bottom for workers, the
environment, intellectual property and transparency.

[America's greatest contribution to peace and progress has been laying
the foundation for an open, rules-based, connected world]{.underline}.
Now we have to decide whether to continue to defend, amend and build
upon that foundation or become complicit in dismantling it.

### AT: LIO Collapse Inevitable

#### The liberal order is fragile \-\-- only sustained US leadership solves. 

**Brands, 18** \-\-- Henry Kissinger Distinguished Professor at Johns
Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies (8/15/18,
Hal, "America's Global Order Is in Retreat; China and Russia would love
to see the collapse of liberal internationalism,"
<https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-08-15/putin-and-xi-threaten-america-s-global-order>,
accessed on 6/28/19, Dhruv)

The "liberal international order" is not a myth, but that doesn't mean
it lacks for problems. In my previous column, I explained what the
liberal order is, how and why the U.S. led its creation, what it has
accomplished, and why the strongest recent critiques of it are
overblown. Yet those critics nonetheless get one thing right: **[The
liberal order is facing a barrage of pressures.]{.underline}**

**[Those pressures are by no means irresistible, but addressing them
will require]{.underline}** --- as a baseline condition --- [**a degree
of U.S. commitment that is presently uncertain**.]{.underline}

[There are three basic challenges testing the liberal order]{.underline}
today. [The first is the instability caused by authoritarian great
powers. These rivals have partially benefited from the
order]{.underline} --- particularly the access it provides to global
markets and capital --- [but nonetheless view it as a barrier to their
geopolitical designs.]{.underline}

[For Russia and China, the liberal international order is]{.underline}
inherently [threatening]{.underline}. This is because [it is rooted in
liberal values that pose an **existential threat** to all authoritarian
regimes]{.underline}, and because it rests on structures and
arrangements --- such as U.S. alliances and military deployments ---
that limit their freedom of action. As Beijing and Moscow have become
more powerful in recent years, they have employed multiple measures ---
incremental coercion in the South China Sea and the Baltics, election
meddling and information warfare, promotion of autocracy overseas,
military buildups and even, in Russia's case, outright invasion of
foreign countries --- to chip away at the liberal order and its guiding
precepts.

[The second challenge is inadequate]{.underline} cohesion and
[cooperation among the countries that make up the order's
core]{.underline}. If the liberal order has been primarily an American
project[, Washington has always pursued that project]{.underline} with
the help of countries that share basic U.S. interests and, in many
cases, values. [That approach]{.underline}, in turn, [has been **key to
the order's success**]{.underline}: It has ensured the "world America
made" has been underwritten not just by the power and initiative of the
U.S., but also the power and initiative of broad geopolitical
coalitions.

[Today, however, these coalitions are under strain and
underperforming,]{.underline} with NATO as the primary example. Having
long neglected their military capabilities, key NATO members ---
including the U.K., France and Germany --- can contribute only minimally
to the defense of the alliance's eastern flank. And when a country as
rich as Germany declines to spend more than 1.5 percent of gross
domestic product on defense, burden-sharing is a real problem. More
broadly, Brexit, the seemingly endless travails of the EU, and the rise
of populism, nationalism and illiberalism in countries across Europe are
tearing at the community of nations that has long been Washington's
partner of first resort.

This relates to the third challenge: the ebbing tide of political and
economic liberalism. **[The liberal order is rooted in liberal values,
but everywhere one looks, those values seem to be in
retreat]{.underline}**. [An authoritarian resurgence is
underway]{.underline} from Latin America to Europe and beyond: According
to Freedom House, the number of countries experiencing declines in
freedom has outnumbered those registering increases every year since
2006. [Protectionist sentiments are surging, owing to uneven economic
growth]{.underline} and feelings of cultural displacement. In any number
of countries, xenophobia, narrow nationalism and other illiberal
sentiments are forming a toxic mix.

These issues are challenging in their own right, but they seem all the
more daunting because they undermine some of the core assumptions that
proponents of the liberal order held as recently as the 1990s and 2000s.
It was commonly believed, in those days, that authoritarian relics such
as China would ultimately liberalize and integrate peacefully into the
existing international order; that the advance of economic and political
liberalization was irreversible; and that the community of Western
nations was being bound together ever more closely. Today, all three
assumptions seem tenuous at best, and are simply unraveling at worst.

When one considers all the problems the international order faces, in
fact, it can be easy to fall into geopolitical despair. Yet if
complacency is dangerous in international affairs, so is premature
despondency. [The liberal order has faced plenty of problems
before]{.underline}, [such as the threat a totalitarian Soviet
Union]{.underline} posed to a prostrate Europe in the early postwar era,
[the global economic crisis of the 1970s,]{.underline} [or the intense
disputes over burden-sharing, nuclear deterrence and everything in
between]{.underline} that have characterized America's alliances since
the day they were formed. In each case, [the challenges were grave
---]{.underline} arguably graver than they are today [--- but the sky
did not fall.]{.underline} **[This should give us hope that the liberal
order may not be doomed]{.underline}** this time around, either.

[The key to preserving the order will be recognition of the imperative
of change and continuity alike]{.underline}. **[The U.S. and its friends
will need to devise new strategies for protecting democracies under
strain]{.underline}**, for addressing incremental coercion and
information warfare, and for preserving globalization in an era of
populism and protectionism.

The liberal democracies may need to undertake shifts with painful
short-term effects, such as pursuing selective economic de-integration
with China as a way of limiting the strategic and military
vulnerabilities interdependence can bring. In Europe and the
Asia-Pacific alike, they must find ways of applying more resources and
generating more multilateral cooperation to keep a resurgent Russia and
a rising China in check. [Yet all this adaptation must be rooted in an
understanding that one thing has not changed]{.underline}: **[the
absolute centrality of engaged and enduring U.S.
leadership.]{.underline}**

Indeed, the gravest threat the liberal order faces is not some
unsolvable, technical problem of statecraft. In a variety of areas where
the order is under strain --- shoring up shaky democracies and dealing
with authoritarian political warfare, competing more effectively and
comprehensively with China, for example --- observers inside or outside
government have already advanced constructive proposals for action. [The
greatest threat]{.underline}, rather, [is that the country that has
traditionally taken the lead in spearheading action and defending the
liberal order from danger will cease to play that role.]{.underline}

**[If the U.S. does not advocate on behalf of democratic values, the
authoritarian resurgence will gather momentum]{.underline}**. If the
U.S. retreats into protectionism, no amount of clever policy by American
allies will be able to shelter the global economy from the damage. If
the U.S. doesn't exert its diplomatic influence to ameliorate or at
least mitigate the strains that have emerged in Europe, the fissures
within the democratic world will grow wider. [The real
danger]{.underline}, in other words, [is that America will make the
long-term strategic decision]{.underline} --- [under Trump]{.underline}
or perhaps his successors --- **[to retreat from the liberal
order]{.underline}**. [Even a decade ago, that prospect would have
seemed unlikely at best; now there are apostles of narrow nationalism
and retrenchment on both sides of the aisle.]{.underline}

It is not putting things too starkly to say that **[the liberal order
will survive only if the U.S. finds the commitment and resolve to
continue supporting it.]{.underline}** [Doing so, however, will require
reconsolidating a domestic political consensus that has frayed in recent
years.]{.underline} That will be the subject of the final piece in this
series.

### AT: Realism 

#### Should still push liberal values despite realism \-\-- basis for U.S. power

**Simpson, 18**\-- Research fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows. He
was formerly a British Army officer. (Emile, "There's Nothing Wrong With
the Liberal Order That Can't Be Fixed by What's Right With It", Foreign
Policy, AUGUST 7, 2018,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/08/07/theres-nothing-wrong-with-the-liberal-order-that-cant-be-fixed-by-whats-right-with-it/)//MJ

This is a point that even the realist skeptics of liberal international
order are prepared to concede when it comes to issues like climate
change. Both Allison and Walt, for example, express regret that the
United States pulled out of the Paris climate change agreement---a
classic instrument of international law. [Yet their view that the United
States should not have pulled out of the Paris agreement contradicts the
claim that international rules are pointless. The same can be said for
their regret that that Washington pulled out the Iran nuclear
agreement.]{.underline}

Rather than emphasize the contradiction, I would emphasize the realists'
common ground with liberal internationalism, which could be extended to
other global problems: money laundering, offshore tax evasion, human
trafficking, and so on. In short, if the realists didn't express such
hostility to the theory of consensual international cooperation, they
would likely support many of its specific expressions.

[Finally, while I accept the realist view that the West should not try
to make the world in its own image by involuntarily pressing its values
on others through the barrel of a gun, **that doesn't mean that liberal
powers shouldn't push for global rules that instantiate liberal
values**.]{.underline} **[Accommodating others does not mean giving up
your own values; it just means recognizing their proper limits, on a
case by case basis.]{.underline}**

[Indeed, this is what the realists get the most wrong in their tendency
to fetishize power over all else. Politics and political order are
downstream from culture, and **the power of the**]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [**ultimately rests on
its values**. The Cold War was not merely about bare power, but two
ideas of what constitutes a just society. The problem since the end of
the Cold War has been that the United States has no clear standard to
define its values against]{.underline}, not least because it has not
pushed back against the disjuncture of capitalism and democracy now
evident whenever autocrats get the benefits of access to the West and
Western investment without signing up to its values.

With the benefit of hindsight, we can see that, since the early 1990s,
the West has traded material gain for damage to its own values. Now we
are seeing the backlash. Don't believe me? Just look at all the corrupt
offshore money in London property, making prices unaffordable for
ordinary, hardworking young people, and wonder why many of them have
lost faith in capitalism. [Values matter in international order, and we
can only see that if we reject the realists' amoral
blinkers.]{.underline}

[Ultimately, peace requires a combination of stability and
justice]{.underline}. With the Roman Empire collapsing around him in the
fifth century A.D., and contemplating a new order, Augustine writes in
The City of God: "Anyone, then, who is rational enough to prefer right
to wrong and order to disorder can see that the kind of peace that is
based on injustice, as compared with that which is based on justice,
does not deserve the name of peace." [In other words, there's nothing
wrong with the international order, and its liberal dimensions, that
can't be fixed by what's right with it.]{.underline}

### AT: Kagan Indicts

#### Kagan's critics are wrong and misinterpret Kagan's work 

**Miller, 19** \-- Professor in the practice of international affairs at
Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, a contributing editor
of Providence, a research fellow with the Ethics & Religious Liberty
Commission, and a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council (Paul D. ,
"Can we Handle the Truth: What Robert Kagan Gets Right About
Liberalism", Providence, May 6, 2019,
https://providencemag.com/2019/05/can-we-handle-the-truth-what-robert-kagan-gets-right-about-liberalism/)//MJ

II.[Kagan has come in for criticism on a number of fronts]{.underline}.
First, several critics have taken him to task for his retelling of
history. Daniel Strand criticizes Kagan's history as "history in the
service of an agenda," and accused him of writing a "salvation
narrative." Paul Marshall says Kagan's history is "sectarian," which is
true, because it is true of every retelling of history. [Strand is at
pains to explain the variations and gradations amongst history's various
non-democratic regimes, which is an interesting non-sequitur that is
true and has no bearing whatsoever on Kagan's actual
argument]{.underline}. Marshall and Joshua Mitchell (rightly) criticize
his simplistic understanding of the Enlightenment and his
underappreciation for religion's role in it.

Second, Marshall complains that Kagan didn't define liberalism in his
essay and criticizes him for not solving liberalism's internal problems
or addressing its weaknesses. [This calls to mind another cliché: the
book reviewer who gives a negative review to a book because "it wasn't
the book I wanted to read." Kagan wasn't writing an essay on liberalism;
he was writing an essay about the state of the world and liberalism's
place in it]{.underline}. Read Jonah Goldberg's Suicide of the West for
a (secular) attempt to reformulate liberalism on sustainable grounds. Or
read Providence Magazine's recent symposium on Augustinian Liberalism
for the beginnings of a Christian approach to the same question.

Third, critics have argued that Kagan simplifies too much by suggesting
a global conflict between the allied democracies on one side and a
menagerie of authoritarian regimes on the other. Strand accuses him of
reductionism. He and Mitchell and Marshall all accuse Kagan of
"Manicheanism."

[This is a tired criticism, a misuse of history, and a misunderstanding
of what Kagan's essay was meant to achieve.]{.underline} Manicheanism
was a religious system in the ancient world that held good and evil were
diametrically opposed and equally powerful. [Today people, like Kagan's
critics, use the word to mean any stark duality between opposites,
especially any opposition between right and wrong. To be frank, this is
intellectually lazy. Every ethical system in history at root depends on
there being a difference between right and wrong]{.underline}. If
"Manicheanism" means any belief that one thing is right and its opposite
is wrong, then I am a Manichean and so is Jesus, and so was Muhammad,
George Washington, and Mother Theresa.

Kagan's survey of the geopolitical landscape is not "Manichean" in any
meaningful sense. [It is not simplistic either: it is simplified, and
deliberately so. Contrasting a thing with its opposite is a helpful way
of forcing us to think in ideal types. Kagan, who has a PhD in history,
is obviously aware of the many nuances and variations in regime type
that have recurred throughout history]{.underline}. But for the purpose
of policy advocacy---for the sake of government work---we can usefully
think of two: liberal and illiberal. Democracy and its opposite. Regimes
founded on respect for the dignity of the individual and regimes that
aren't. This is a key variable that explains a wide range of state
behavior.

Criticizing Kagan for a lack of nuance here is criticizing him for
something he wasn't trying to do in the first place. [Kagan is moving
from scholarship to advocacy, simplifying a complex world to communicate
big picture ideas to a broad audience.]{.underline} He is doing the work
of a public intellectual, trying his hand at persuasion in the public
square, not in peer review. If you want the peer-reviewed version of his
argument, go read his other books (or mine), but don't criticize an
essay for not being as long and nuanced as the books he's already
written. [The simplified view of the world Kagan offers is correct in
its broad outlines and thus is a helpful contribution to public debate
and to policymakers, for whom liberal ideology functions as their de
facto operational code.]{.underline}

III\.

Fourth, critics seem most upset by Kagan's suggestion that the
geopolitical conflict between democrats and authoritarians is mirrored
in domestic political conflicts in the United States between
nationalists and internationalists. The critics' concern is
understandable: it sounds like Kagan is saying that disagreeing with him
is not merely wrong, it is disloyal and possibly dangerous. Intellectual
dissidents become a suspect Fifth Column for the authoritarian
international.

[Kagan, of course, says nothing of the kind. In fact, he acknowledges a
disturbing truth I've written about elsewhere. "Indeed, these days the
anti-liberal critique is so pervasive, at both ends of the political
spectrum and in the most energetic segments of both political parties,
that there is scarcely an old-style American liberal to be found."
Illiberalism is rife everywhere on the American political spectrum, from
the progressive left to the nationalist right.]{.underline}

Kagan is not accusing his critics of treason; he is drawing attention to
the clear connection between domestic politics and foreign affairs. In
Dangerous Nation Kagan made a similar argument about westward expansion
in the 19th century. I do not have the book in front of me, but if
memory serves Kagan argued that westward expansion slowed in the 1840s,
not because of structural conditions or the economy, but because of
ideology and domestic politics. The Democrats were pro-expansion because
they wanted to expand slavery and, subsequently, their grip on national
power. Whigs, who won power in 1840 and again 1848, slowed expansion to
prevent the Democrats from carrying out their plans.

[It is not unreasonable to observe a similar connection between domestic
politics and U.S. foreign policy today. Elections have
consequences]{.underline}. Americans elected Barack Obama in 2008 on a
platform of ending the Iraq War. He carried out his promise, and Iraq
collapsed in chaos and genocidal violence as a result, much as President
George W. Bush predicted and apparently as Americans wanted.

#### Kagan is the best historian on this 

**Stewart, 18**\-- New York--based political writer. His work has
appeared in National Review, the Wall Street Journal, and The American
Interest, among other publications (Brain, "America Is Abdicating Its
Role In Global Leadership", The Federalist, OCTOBER 5, 2018,
https://thefederalist.com/2018/10/05/america-is-abdicating-its-role-in-global-leadership/)//MJ

A Distinctly Unnatural Rise

[In a timely and trenchant new book, Robert Kagan argues that the
progressive conceit about the inevitable triumph of the liberal ideal
was always nonsense.]{.underline} In The Jungle Grows Back: America and
Our Imperiled World, Kagan explains that democratic capitalism is not
remotely the world's default system of political economy[. A
distinguished historian and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution,
Kagan also dissents from the prevailing view that war has become (in
Pinker's words) "all but obsolete."]{.underline}

[Kagan's tightly argued brief offers a sorely needed reeducation about
the strategic and moral realities of power in an imperfect
world]{.underline}. Against the chic theories of "permanent peace,"
Kagan takes the bleaker perspective of the ancient Greek philosophers
Heraclitus and Plato that war is the "father of all," while peace is a
mere parenthesis in human affairs.

On this view the source of progress in the postwar era is not the
natural culmination of historical forces, but instead the distinctly
unnatural rise to preeminence of the United States, and its choice to be
actively engaged in the world[. At a time of rising authoritarian
nationalism across the West, what gives The Jungle Grows Back its
special value is Kagan's cogent explication of the heyday of American
internationalism.]{.underline}

After the Second World War, U.S. officials reluctantly arrived at the
conclusion that it fell to their nation -- as much for its own sake as
for the world's -- to construct a more durable international system than
the one that had collapsed in the late 1930s. Blessed with advantageous
geography (its relative isolation makes it less vulnerable to attack and
less threatening to others), unparalleled economic and military might,
not to mention a national ideology based on Enlightenment principles,
the United States was uniquely positioned to take up the mantle of
global leadership.

Still, the question lingered: would Americans accept this onerous duty
that history had thrust upon them? [There was, as Kagan painstakingly
reminds us, nothing preordained about their decision. After World War I,
the United States had balked at such a burdensome role when it rejected
both the League of Nations and participation in the Versailles
settlement]{.underline}. At the time, of course, the British fleet ruled
the waves, underwriting a relatively open world order that made
America's continued rise a fait accompli.

### AT: Australian Leadership Good

#### Australia fill in worse---engages with authoritarian regimes.

That said, **[Australia's regional human rights posture has not been
totally out of step with the Administration's less proselytising
approach]{.underline}**. [Australia has maintained diplomatic engagement
with Southeast Asian states such as Myanmar, Thailand and Malaysia, in a
pragmatic assessment of the security and economic benefits of
engagement, regional stability, and regional cooperation]{.underline}
(against transnational crime, for instance). [Australia's approach ---
including not wanting the United States to push too hard on human rights
in the region --- is driven by the sensitivities of not wanting to be
seen to preach to and interfere in the internal affairs of Asian states,
and not wanting to push the region towards China.]{.underline}

### AT: Transactionalism Good -- Top Level

#### Trump's transactionalism is collapsing U.S. foreign policy and risks another world war \-\-- only a reboot that emphasizes human rights and democracy can resolve it

- no shared interests

- rogue regimes are more unreliable and unstable

- public won't support it

- every alliance doesn't have to be grounded in shared democratic values
  but it is still bad to coddle autocratic regimes

**Rubin, 18** \-\-- J.D. from UC Berkeley (10/19/18, Jennifer, "Why
transactional foreign policy is destined to fail,"

accessed on 6/12/19, JMP)

[Since the Iraq War, debate has raged in U.S. foreign policy circles and
in public discussion about the extent to which the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [should involve itself
in the world and **exert global leadership**]{.underline}. Critics of
President George W. [Bush]{.underline} (who said in his second inaugural
address that "it is the policy of the United States to seek and support
the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and
culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world")
[and]{.underline} of President Barack [Obama]{.underline} asserted that
Bush overextended the United States while Obama "led from behind" with
unsatisfactory results. Both, however, [understood that our closest
allies were democracies that shared our values]{.underline}.

Then along came President Trump. My colleague Robert Kagan wrote in June
that Trump saw "the United States as rogue superpower, neither
isolationist nor internationalist, neither withdrawing nor in decline,
but active, powerful and entirely out for itself. In recent months, on
trade, Iran, NATO defense spending and perhaps even North Korea,
President [Trump has shown that a president willing to throw off the
moral, ideological and strategic constraints that limited U.S. action in
the past can bend this intractable world to his will, at least for a
while."]{.underline}

Even worse, [the less democratic and the more vicious the regime (with
the exception of Iran), the more Trump has lavished praise on it, giving
the impression that our interests and theirs are in perfect
sync]{.underline}, while our traditional allies (with the exception of
Israel) were taking advantage of us, weighing us down. It wasn't enough
to conduct polite, self-interested diplomacy with the likes of Russian
President Vladimir Putin or Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan; we
had to fawn over them and act as their PR agents.

[Such a foreign policy was bound to fail]{.underline} for no less than
three reasons.

First, [it's not based in reality. Russia doesn't share our interests in
Europe or the Middle East, and therefore cannot be our
partner.]{.underline} North Korea does not seem to share our interest in
denuclearizing (unless it wrenches South Korea out from U.S.
protection). Inevitably conflicts arise when the glowing orb or the red
carpet get put away.

Second, [rogue regimes are by their nature **unstable and
unreliable**]{.underline}. Hosni [Mubarak's Egypt was a case in point.
In providing nondemocratic partners with undiluted praise and support,
**we encourage behaviors that ultimately make them less stable, less
prosperous and more corrupt.**]{.underline}

And third, [**ultimately the American people won't stand for it**, as
we've seen with Saudi Arabia, when our supposed partners shatter
international norms, commit human rights atrocities and impinge on their
neighbors' sovereignty --- which they inevitably do]{.underline}.

[As Kagan explained,]{.underline} **["Trump's policies are pure realism,
devoid of ideals and sentiment, pursuing a narrow 'national interest'
defined strictly in terms of dollars and cents]{.underline}** and
defense against foreign attack. [Trump's world is a struggle of
all-against-all. **There are no relationships based on common values.**
**There are merely transactions determined by power. It is the world
that a century ago brought us two world wars."**]{.underline}

At present, [such a foreign policy brings]{.underline} about continual
disappointment and [**visceral backlash from the American people**. **It
diminishes our moral authority in the world**, **alienates our actual
democratic friends**, **makes us look weak and entangles us in costly
and counterproductive trade wars**.]{.underline} [Trump and his enablers
are now caught: They cozied up to a regime that acts in repugnant ways
(slaughtering civilians in Yemen, killing a U.S. journalist), triggering
a backlash in Congress and the court of public opinion.]{.underline} In
lieu of our own coherent Iran policy we relied on a regime that acts in
ways the American people find intolerable. **[Our "transaction" no
longer works, and we have no backup plan.]{.underline}**

**[This does not mean that all of our alliances must be grounded in
shared, democratic values. It does, however, require that we not
outsource our foreign policy to autocratic regimes and that we hold them
accountable for their conduct. We must continue to stand up for
universal human rights.]{.underline}** It also means we need to commit
our own resources and assemble our own coalitions to burden-share (as we
did in the first Gulf War). [For the sake of international comity, we
must avoid knee-jerk repudiation of international agreements. Otherwise,
we wind up looking like suckers at the mercy of corrupt, brutal regimes.
This is not winning, by any definition.]{.underline}

#### Transactionalism fails in the context of foreign policy---complex issues. 

Leon **Hadar, 17**, Leon Hadar, geopolitical expert at RANE Network, a
risk management consulting group 1-2-2017, The Limits of Trump\'s
Transactional Foreign Policy, National
Interest, <https://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-limits-trumps-transactional-foreign-policy-18898>,
6-29-2019, Dhruv **\*\*Gendered language edited\*\***

One of the popular conclusions among those trying to deconstruct
President-elect Donald [Trump's foreign policy vision, is]{.underline}
that such a vision may not exist, and that the
businessman-turned-president is a not a man of ideas, and certainly not
an idealist or an ideologue, but a pragmatic technocrat who approaches
policy issues on a case-by-case basis [very much like a business
transaction.]{.underline}

A man who loves to fix things in the same way he helped bring back to
life the business he inherited from his father, **[Trump considers
himself a great dealmaker]{.underline}** and he thinks that all the
problems facing the United States, including in the international
arenas---immigration, trade, national security---are consequences of bad
deals made by incompetent figures.

Moreover, insofar as [he seems to be raising broad political and
strategic issues]{.underline}, he does so [in the form of a
cost-effective analysis]{.underline}. Hence presidential candidate Trump
questioned the need to continue participating in NATO or maintain U.S.
security commitments in East Asia, arguing that Americans are not
getting bang when it comes to protecting its allies. It is just becoming
too expensive when we need the money to spend on other things; although
we may consider maintaining these military alliances if the South
Koreans and the Germans pay us what we deserve for carrying out our
services.

Some would argue that contrary to the caricaturizing by his detractors
as an impulsive foreign policy ignoramus, Trump's plans to impose
punishing tariffs on China, or for that matter, his call for reassessing
U.S. membership in NATO, should be compared to opening bids in an
auction or a bridge game. No, President Trump isn't a raving
isolationist who wants to pull U.S. troops from the Atlantic or the
Pacific or a China basher looking forward to launching a costly trade
war with Beijing. Like a shrewd businessman he wants to demonstrate that
he is entering into the diplomatic game with a strong hand, exerting
pressure on the Chinese to make a deal under which Washington would drop
its threat of imposing sanctions in exchange for China agreeing to
refrain from manipulating its exchange rate. And facing the prospects of
the United States ending its security commitments to them, Germany and
Korea will agree to spending more on their defense.

More recently, following the phone conversation between Trump and
Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-Wen, some critics argued that it violated
the spirit of the agreements made with Beijing in 1979 with respect to
the so-called One-China Policy and amounted to a diplomatic blunder.

But then Trump during in
an [interview](http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/11/politics/donald-trump-china-taiwan/) with Fox
News seemed to suggest that it was a calculated move on his part, noting
that he wasn't "bound by a One-China Policy unless we make a deal with
China having to do with other things, including trade."

In response, some analysts have proposed that President-elect Trump was
inaugurating a new era of "transactional diplomacy" as opposed to the
kind of "transformational diplomacy" championed by the administration of
President George W. Bush.

Forget the Freedom Agenda and nation building. Replace Making the World
Safe for Democracy idealism with Making America Great Again realism. In
his dealings with other governments, the author of the Art of the
Deal would not be promoting American ideals around the world but
ensuring that the United States would achieve concrete results that
could be measured in dollars and cents.

In fact, assuming that this is, indeed, what Trumpism would mean in the
area of foreign policy, it's important to note that it won't mark a
dramatic shift in American diplomacy.

Hence as part of FDR's lend-lease agreement with Britain, the United
States ended-up seizing what was left of Britain's gold reserves and
overseas investments to help pay for increased defense production.

And during the Cold War and the era of détente, President Richard Nixon
and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger branded the notion of
transactional diplomacy as the so-called "linkage" policy under which
they pressured Moscow and Beijing to restrain revolutionary movements in
the third world (and communist parties in Europe, in the case of the
Soviet Union) in exchange for American concessions in the economic and
nuclear areas: Progress in area A was dependent on progress in area B
and vice versa.

It also makes some sense that those who are masters in the art of the
deal would be able to negotiate better trade agreements and even
diplomatic accords than your average politician or government
bureaucrat.

From that perspective, Trumpists note that President-elect Trump and his
secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson are two tough and cunning
businessmen who have demonstrated a lot of success in winning in their
negotiations with their counterparts in the corporate world. That proves
that they could be more effective in making deals with China or Iran
than President Barack Obama, Secretary of State John Kerry, and other
officials that Trump has depicted in numerous occasions as "incompetent"
and even "stupid."

But [the notion that to make foreign policy work, all you need are
astute and tough businessmen]{.underline} who would make it more
cost-effective [is misleading,]{.underline} especially if you consider
the following: [No one would be willing to die fighting to protect the
interests of ExxonMobil or to improve the Trump brand.]{.underline}

Unlike international business, **[foreign policy and national security
involve issues of war and peace,]{.underline}** and by extension, of
life and death. And [when we elect a president, we put our trust in
the]{.underline} next commander in chief as opposed to the new CEO of
the United States; in the [leader of our national tribe who would
protect us]{.underline} and our families [from a foreign
threat,]{.underline} and not in the trader in chief who would make great
international deals for us.

Indeed, the [national interest isn't akin to corporate
interest]{.underline}. It embodies the core values and sense of identity
of a national community. In a way, we know that it's a core national
interest when the citizens of a country are willing to be sent to war
and pay enormous human and economic costs involved in fighting a war. In
the context of national security, "[cost-effective" makes sense
not]{.underline} exclusively [in terms of dollars and cents, but in
terms of deterring an aggressor]{.underline} or if worse comes to worst,
in winning a war. No one is willing to die in order to force China to
raise the value of its currency.

A president does rely on the advice of non-elected officials, of
economists, engineers and scientists as well as business executives who
help him or her carry out foreign and domestic policies. These
technocrats or policy wonks do make decisions based on cold
cost-effective calculations, like whether we should impose a 10 percent
or 15 percent tariff on Vietnamese agricultural imports.

But **[it's the job of the elected president to make the critical
foreign policy decisions that could lead to wars based on
\[their\]]{.underline}** his or her ability not only to feel the mood of
the nation, but also on a personal sense of what America is all about, a
perspective which is usually grounded in reading history and in a **[set
of values]{.underline}**. The technocrats help ensure that the decision
he or she makes will be successfully executed.

President-elect Trump, who seems to frame every policy problem in
cost-effective terms and assumes that it could be resolved as a business
transaction needs, therefore, to recognize that his job goes beyond
making deals.  

"I would love to be the one who made peace with Israel and the
Palestinians, that would be such a great achievement,"
Trump [told](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/us/politics/donald-trump-visit.html?_r=0&mtrref=www.aljazeera.com&gwh=841F96AB4835B0B64EDD0D513CCBA568&gwt=pay) the New
York Times editorial board recently, suggesting that he could appoint
his son-in-law to broker a deal after taking over.

But the idea that Israelis and Palestinians have failed to make peace
due to the lack of negotiating skills on the part of the American peace
brokers would be dismissed by anyone who took an introductory course on
Middle East politics, and understands that [both sides are driven by
deep-rooted historical, religious and psychological forces, and that
each side would not be willing to compromise on what it sees as its
national interest and could pose a threat to its existence and core
national values.]{.underline}

Which is the main reason why these and other conflicts, like in Kashmir,
Cyprus or Nagorno-Karabakh will not be resolved anytime soon even if
President Trump assigns the best and the brightest Harvard MBAs to
negotiate them or tries to do that himself.

[Unlike international business, foreign policy and national security
involve issues of war and peace, and by extension, of life and
death.]{.underline}

It is impossible to know for certain what approach President-elect
Donald [Trump]{.underline} will take to supporting democracy and human
rights abroad. So far, he [has offered]{.underline} only scattered
[hints]{.underline}---**[expressions of instincts and impulses that
largely point toward a disinclination to engage in democracy
promotion]{.underline}** but remain far from being elaborated into
concrete policy plans. In addition, **[Trump's leadership style and the
overall troubled state of U.S. democracy will clearly hurt U.S. efforts
to advance democracy's global fortunes in the years
ahead.]{.underline}** While all of this points almost uniformly in a
negative direction, it is likely that as Trump and his team move to
actual policymaking, their actions in this domain will prove less
consistently negative than their initial signals might indicate.
NEGATIVE SIGNALS

Throughout his campaign, **[Trump emphasized his intention to take a
purely transactional approach to other international
powers]{.underline}**. [Underlying this approach is the idea that the
United States will define its interests narrowly and thereby focus on
U.S. economic interests and core security concerns]{.underline} (above
all, counterterrorism). **[Democracy and human rights in other
countries, and other "soft" interests, are to be put aside in the
pursuit of a get-tough, America-first foreign policy.]{.underline}**
According to Trump and his advisers, their [counterterrorism strategy
will rest on stepped-up military
efforts](http://www.time.com/4309786/read-donald-trumps-america-first-foreign-policy-speech/) and
possibly harsher treatment of suspected terrorists who are detained or
imprisoned. [They have shown no interest in longer-term political
approaches to undercutting the roots of state fragility]{.underline}:
for example, [Trump declared at a public
event](http://www.readingeagle.com/news/article/in-his-own-words-donald-trump-in-hershey) in
December that "we're going to stop trying to build new nations in
far-off lands" that "you've never even heard of."

[In line with his promise of transactionalism**, Trump has taken a
strikingly friendly approach toward various foreign
strongmen.**]{.underline} His favorable statements about Russian
President Vladimir Putin have attracted the most attention but are only
one part of a larger pattern that includes a recent sympathetic
statement about [Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's brutal
crackdown](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/03/world/asia/philippines-rodrigo-duterte-donald-trump.html) on
undocumented immigrants and drug traffickers, a backslapping meeting
with Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in New York in September,
and an effusive postelection telephone call with Hungary's Prime
Minister Viktor Orbán. [He has made it clear that in pursuing warmer
relationships with such leaders, he does not intend to raise unpleasant
truths about their democratic shortcomings.]{.underline} Of course, the
United States has long maintained cozy ties with various nondemocratic
governments for the sake of security and economic interests; but
**[Trump has been offering a kind of lavish praise that generally does
not characterize such relationships and that extends to strongmen
leaders who are not even strategically important to the United
States]{.underline}** (like Orbán).

[Another serious negative signal related to democracy policy is Trump's
deep-seated doubts about the value of core U.S.
alliances---]{.underline}both [with NATO]{.underline} partners
[and]{.underline} other crucial longtime [[allies such as Japan and
South
Korea](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/us/politics/donald-trump-foreign-policy.html).]{.underline}
He has exhibited a lack of appreciation of these alliances[, which are
foundational elements of a broader international order that the United
States helped establish and has led for more than a half
century]{.underline}---an order rooted in liberal political values.
**[Without anchoring specific democracy policies and programs in a
larger strategy to preserve this international order, such efforts will
lack real weight.]{.underline}**

#### The [perception]{.underline} of Trump's transactionalism emboldens autocrats to act with impunity

**Hamid, 18** \-\-- senior fellow in the Project on U.S. Relations with
the Islamic World in the Center for Middle East Policy at Brookings
(11/5/18, Shadi, "Deconstructing Trump's foreign policy,"
<https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/11/05/deconstructing-trumps-foreign-policy/>,
accessed on 6/8/19, JMP)

It is possible to think two things at once: that U.S. President Donald
Trump's foreign policy has been "bad," which many think it has been, and
that it has offered a somewhat coherent alternative for how the United
States should conduct itself beyond its borders. This suggests that the
casual and smug dismissals of Trump, on domestic and foreign policy
alike, are missing something important.

An Ostentatious Approach

[As someone who believes that American ideals matter
abroad]{.underline}---[particularly]{.underline} that [support for human
rights and democracy abroad is the only way to advance our interests in
the long run]{.underline}---[I would not be able]{.underline}, under
almost any conceivable scenario, [to support Trump's foreign
policy]{.underline}. I have a different worldview with different
starting assumptions. From a nationalist perspective, however, [the
Trump doctrine]{.underline} offers considerable appeal. It emphasizes,
even [idealizes, American "sovereignty," based around a narrow
conception of U.S. economic and security interests]{.underline}. [This
results in a more obviously **transactional foreign policy**, with the
president pursuing those interests with **little regard for
international norms or institutions**.]{.underline} Non-citizens are
given little consideration, and values and ideals are perceived as
luxuries at best and obstacles to the pursuit of the national interest
at worst. Stylistically, the Trump doctrine is spare, unsentimental, and
confrontational---almost ostentatiously so.

As with most doctrines, the policy doesn't quite match the rhetoric. But
Trump's stamp on American foreign policy will continue to matter in its
clear and ambitious attempt to put forward a set of guidelines for those
who wish to carry the "America First" mantle into the future. In other
words, Trump has managed to introduce a set of ideas that have their own
inherent power, even if his administration does not always reflect these
ideas in day-to-day foreign policy. This, along with profound shifts in
domestic politics, could ensure that Trump is remembered as one of the
more consequential presidents of the modern era.

For example, Trump's Sept. 25 address to the U.N. General Assembly was
aggressively outside Washington's bipartisan consensus emphasizing the
importance of U.S. leadership in preserving the " liberal international
order" and, at the very least, paying lip service to the promotion of
democracy abroad. **[Except where Washington can use human rights as a
cudgel against its enemies, Trump has displayed practically no interest
in other countries' internal conduct.]{.underline}** This is in keeping
with what I call " cultural sovereignty," which the president expounded
on in his address:

"Each of us here today is the emissary of a distinct culture, a rich
history, and a people bound together by ties of memory, tradition, and
the values that make our homelands like nowhere else on Earth ... I
honor the right of every nation in this room to pursue its own customs,
beliefs, and traditions. The United States will not tell you how to live
or work or worship."

The rest of the speech tended toward the dark and confrontational,
avoiding even the pretense of foreign policy idealism. It was chilling
in its straightforward aversion to the spirit of compromise and
cooperation. Of course, some of this is posturing, but some of it is
quite real. In the Middle East, Trump's predecessor Barack Obama hoped
for less conflict but showed little interest in investing the resources
needed to achieve that outcome. (The one initiative it did expend
notable energy on, the Iran deal, was founded on misplaced premises, as
I've argued elsewhere). Trump couldn't be more different from Obama in
both instincts and intentions. Yet he has taken Obama's studied
disengagement to a different---perhaps logical ---level: unapologetic
indifference.

Indifference in Action

A telling encapsulation of this is [Trump's early remarks on the
repercussions Saudi Arabia could face for the assassination
of]{.underline} journalist Jamal [Khashoggi]{.underline}. **[He first
thought about the transactional nature of Washington's relationship with
Riyadh:]{.underline}** ["I don't like stopping massive amounts of money
that are being poured into our country]{.underline} on---I know they're
talking about different kinds of sanctions, but [they're spending \$110
billion on military equipment and on things that create
jobs]{.underline}, like jobs and others, for this country." Trump also
pointed out that Khashoggi wasn't a U.S. citizen (he was a resident of
Virginia), implying a sharp distinction between citizens and
non-citizens that anchors Trump's stark and hyper-realist worldview. In
this reading, if Khashoggi were an American citizen, then it would fall
under American sovereignty; that he isn't a citizen places it outside
the domain of "America First." Trump has since threatened "severe
punishment" but has resisted taking any action that might affect arms
sales.

**[The perception]{.underline}**, whether fair or unfair, **[that Trump
will generally have very little response to human rights abuses
determines the risks allies are willing to take]{.underline}**.
**[Emboldened autocrats acting with more impunity than before are a
logical and tragic result]{.underline}** of "America First." By any
reasonable standard---and in actual measurable outcomes---[betting big
on Saudi Arabia's young crown prince]{.underline}, Mohammed bin Salman,
[has been a terrible misstep, but it does not undermine the coherence of
a worldview that sees little room for moral outrage directed toward
friends as long those friends serve a narrowly defined understanding of
U.S. national interests.]{.underline} (I purposely use "friends" rather
than "allies," since Canada, in the Trump worldview, is more ally than a
friend).

There is, then, a method to what appears to so many as either madness or
stupidity, or both. But to have a method and to display more, rather
than less, coherence is not necessarily a good thing.

#### Trump's morally devoid foreign policy [emboldens autocrats]{.underline} \-\-- the president or congress could reverse the signal

**McFaul, 18** \-\-- Director of the Freeman Spogli Institute for

Interest,"

accessed on 6/22/19, JMP)

Since the beginning of our republic, all American presidents have had to
balance the dueling goals of advancing democratic values with the
pursuit of security and economic interests. The tension first arose in
response to the French Revolution. Should the United States support our
most important ally at the time, the French monarchy, or those espousing
the same values of our revolution? This tension became more pronounced
in the twentieth century when the United States had the power to
influence the domestic politics of other countries, including at times
through the use of force. [Some presidents embraced the mission of
democracy promotion as a central tenant of American foreign policy.
Others gravitated to more so-called "realist" strategies]{.underline},
placing more emphasis on the pursuit of conventionally defined security
goals. But [all presidents since World War II pursued both objectives to
varying degrees --- defending our values and pursuing our
interests]{.underline}. Great champions of freedom such as Ronald Reagan
or George W. Bush also worked with autocrats, be it in Latin America or
South Africa for Reagan or Saudi Arabia for Bush. Likewise,
self-described realists such as Richard Nixon or George H. W. Bush also
made aspirational statements about America as a defender of righteous
values. And [most presidents who had to engage autocrats in the pursuit
of American economic or security interests did so with a conscience,
knowing and feeling the hypocrisy of the act]{.underline}.

President **[Trump marks a radical departure from all of these
presidents]{.underline}**, Democrat or Republican, realist or liberal.
**[Trump does not even pretend to wrestle with the contradictions
between our values and interests.]{.underline}** Instead, [he embraces
dictators and chastises democratic leaders]{.underline}. He has devoted
more critical words to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Canadian
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau than to Russia's Vladimir Putin and North
Korea's Kim Jong Un. Unlike previous presidents, Trump appears to feel
no shame whatsoever in appeasing these autocrats.

**[In making clear his distaste for any discussion of morality, ethics,
or values in the conduct of his foreign policy, Trump has emboldened the
world's autocrats to undertake increasingly outlandish
acts.]{.underline}** Remarkably, Vladimir [Putin, Kim Jong Un, and
now]{.underline} apparently **[M]{.underline}**ohammad
**[B]{.underline}**in [Salman all now have ordered gruesome
assassinations against people living outside of their countries during
Trump's time]{.underline} in office; two of these attempts succeeded.
Yet, to date, none of these autocrats have received any rebuke from
Trump personally, even when his own foreign policy administration
rebuffed their actions. After Kim Jong Un appeared to have killed his
half-brother in Kuala Lumpur in February 2017, Trump announced that he
and the North Korean dictator had fallen in love. After the Putin regime
ordered the assassination of Sergey Skripal in the United Kingdom in
March 2018, the Trump administration responded, but Trump himself stood
next to the Russian autocrat in Helsinki in July 2018 and professed his
deep admiration for the Russian leader. Now in October 2018, the Saudi
regime has assassinated journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and thus far Trump
has only blamed the cover up as poorly handled, but not yet underscored
the inhumanity of the operation. His administration has revoked the
visas of those involved in the assassination, but not yet committed to
any more serious punishment of Riyadh.

There is a pattern here.

[In the past, American presidents who engaged with dictators justified
their diplomacy by securing vital national interests, be it defeating
Hitler in World War II, expanding American economic opportunities in
China, or defeating terrorists in the Middle East.]{.underline} What is
striking about **[Trump's embrace of dictators so far is that he has
achieved few if any outcomes in the American national
interest]{.underline}**. His bromance with Kim Jung Un has yielded only
pledges about future denuclearization, not any actual reductions in
North Korea's nuclear arsenal. [Trump champions the economic benefits of
multi-billion-dollar arms sales to Saudi Arabia, but these big numbers
are again mostly promises about future sales, and would have
happened]{.underline} (and did happen before Trump's time in office)
[without lavishing praise on]{.underline} **[M]{.underline}**ohammad
**[B]{.underline}**in **[S]{.underline}**alman. Trump's bearhug of Putin
has yielded nothing --- no Russian withdrawal from Ukraine, no new arms
controls agreements, and not even a reversal of the ban on adoptions of
Russian children for American families.

The horrific murder of Jamal Khashoggi adds a tragic, emphatic
exclamation point to the bankruptcy of Trump's present course.
[**Hopefully, Trump might now see the wisdom of promoting our values and
advancing our interests at the same time.** But if he does not pivot,
then his administration, the U.S. Congress, the private sector, and the
American people must step up and fill the void.]{.underline} Invoking
the Global Magnitsky Act, members of Congress should press for new
sanctions against those Saudi officials involved in Khashoggi's murder
when they return from recess, and not just those who murdered Khashoggi,
but those who ordered the assassination. **[Modeled after the Leahy Law,
which prohibits financial assistance in purchasing arms for human rights
abusers, the U.S. Congress could adopt new legislation prohibiting the
sale of American arms to countries that grossly violate human
rights.]{.underline}** [Politicians, administration officials,
journalists and academics should question the false assumption of
American dependence on Saudi Arabia for anything --- be it oil, finance,
or deterrence against Iran --- **and realize Saudi Arabia's deep
reliance on us for security and prosperity**.]{.underline}
Companies --- especially lobbying firms --- could interrupt or cancel
their contracts with the Saudi government. And [American citizens should
vote for candidates committed to **inserting morality as an element on
American diplomacy**]{.underline}.

[When]{.underline} President [Trump argues]{.underline} that
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[can't halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia over the]{.underline} Saudis'
alleged [murder of]{.underline} journalist and Post contributor Jamal
[Khashoggi]{.underline}, **[he's giving up a key piece of leverage over
Riyadh for no reason at all]{.underline}**. What's worse, **[Trump
is]{.underline}** also **[turning one of America's best strategic assets
into a liability, a massive unforced error that could weaken
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[worldwide]{.underline}**.

[Trump has said repeatedly he doesn't want to halt --- or even threaten
to halt --- U.S. arms sales]{.underline} to the Saudi regime
[because]{.underline} (he says) [it would]{.underline} cost U.S. jobs
and [hand over a sweet contract to Moscow or Beijing]{.underline}.

"They are ordering military equipment. Everybody in the world wanted
that order. Russia wanted it, China wanted it, we wanted it. We got it,"
Trump said on "60 Minutes" Sunday. "I don't want to hurt jobs. I don't
want to lose an order like that."

Set aside that Trump's claim of \$110 billion of arms sales to Saudi
Arabia as announced last year is hugely exaggerated, considering that
number mostly refers to deals struck during the Obama administration and
new deals that haven't yet materialized. **[The significant arms-sales
relationship we do have with Saudi Arabia gives us enormous leverage
over them]{.underline}**, leverage Trump should use to pressure King
Salman to reveal what his regime knows about Khashoggi's disappearance.

**[Saudi Arabia's military is already built around U.S. and British
defense platforms, meaning they can't easily switch to Russian or
Chinese systems.]{.underline}** [**Riyadh is especially dependent on
U.S. arms right now** because their bloody war in Yemen requires a
constant flow of U.S. munitions]{.underline}, not to mention U.S.
intelligence, maintenance and refueling support.

**[U.S. arms sales]{.underline}** are not simply a financial deal or a
jobs program; they **[represent a strategic advantage of
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.
**[Countries want U.S. weapons because they are the best. That gives us
connections, influence and, yes, leverage over these
countries.]{.underline}** [That's how arms sales have always worked,
until Trump flipped the script.]{.underline}

**["The White House seems to be saying that Trump Doctrine is that the
U.S. will ignore your human rights abuses]{.underline}**, assassinations
or war crimes [**as long as you buy things from us**. He's got it
totally and completely backwards,"]{.underline} Sen. Chris
[Murphy]{.underline} (D-Conn.) [told me. **"What's the point of being a
military superpower if we lose leverage when we do business with another
country?"**]{.underline}

"What the president doesn't realize is that **[this makes him look weak
and small]{.underline}**. **[World leaders will now know they can act
with impunity so long as they are buying American weapons. That's an
insane message to send,"]{.underline}** Murphy said. ["The]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [should never be boxed
in because of who we sell weapons to --- **countries who buy U.S.
weapons should feel enormous pressure to stay on our good
side."**]{.underline}

Sen. Marco [Rubio]{.underline} (R-Fla.) [made a similar
point]{.underline} Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union" with Jake
Tapper.

**["Arm sales are important, not because of the money, but because it
also provides leverage over their future behavior,"]{.underline}** he
said. "You know ... [they will need our spare parts. They will need our
training. And those are things **we can use to influence their
behavior**."]{.underline}

Congress does have a role to play in approving arms sales, and all
indications are that they plan to intervene on sales to Riyadh if it is
shown that the Saudi regime had a hand in Khashoggi's death. The State
Department approved a \$15 billion sale of the Terminal High Altitude
Air Defense (THAAD) missile defense system to Saudi Arabia this month.
The Pentagon said last week Saudi Arabia has signed letters of offer or
acceptance of \$14.5 billion worth of American helicopters, tanks,
ships, weapons and training.

In June, the Senate narrowly voted down a resolution to halt the sale of
hundreds of millions of dollars worth of precision-guided munitions to
the Saudi military out of concern they could be used to target Yemeni
civilians. After the vote, Senate Foreign Relations Committee ranking
Democrat Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said he opposed the sale, placing it
in limbo.

[The threat of congressional action would be more effective if the
president]{.underline} of the United States [wasn't publicly undermining
Congress's message, said]{.underline} William [Hartung, director of the
Arms and Security Project at the Center for International
Policy]{.underline}.

**["Trump is not even trying to use this leverage,"]{.underline}** he
said. "He's completely given it away, and not only that, **[he's
announced to the world that he's giving it away."]{.underline}**

Through a basic misunderstanding of national security and diplomacy, the
president has once again undermined U.S. interests and made the work of
his own team --- including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo --- much more
difficult. **[Thinking of arms sales purely in dollar terms doesn't make
any sense.]{.underline}**

So [what is likely to change if Trump switches to transactional
diplomacy]{.underline} on steroids? First, [many quid pro
quo negotiations will become politicized.]{.underline} By making these
negotiations public, the United States -- but also third parties -- need
to defend their deals to domestic audiences [which]{.underline} often
[greatly limits the political leeway diplomats hold]{.underline}.
Second, **[a deleterious propensity toward profit is likely to
infiltrate many, if not all, global interactions]{.underline}**. [If the
US wants other countries to pay up, they will likely ask for the
same.]{.underline} Third, **[it is unlikely that the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[will always come out
on top of those deals]{.underline}**. [The US government actually paid a
small fortune
to [Kyrgyzstan](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R40564.pdf) for housing a US
military base critical for US operations in Afghanistan. Kyrgyzstan knew
how much the United States needed that base -- a fact which
substantively increased its bargaining power.]{.underline} Fourth, in a
transactional world, [states have an inherent interest in limiting their
cooperation commitment to a strict minimum to ensure their 'profit
margins]{.underline}.' In other words, [no state has an interest to
perform its mission or cooperation commitment to the
fullest]{.underline} (i.e., choose the most effective solution no matter
the costs) [but rather to restrict its involvement to a degree that is
minimally necessary not to jeopardize the deal.]{.underline} And
finally, President [Trump has a tendency to think that the United States
is the only country that can provide "services" to the rest of the
world]{.underline}. But again [that's a fallacy]{.underline}. **[In a
transactional world, all states have tradable and marketable
assets]{.underline}** -- or at least can develop them. **[Many countries
might then ask: Maybe China or Russia can deliver cheaper "services"
than the United States]{.underline}**? [Or, maybe my country should
develop these capabilities (e.g**., nuclear weapons**]{.underline}) on
its own? Why rely on a third party?

[Deals and quid pro quos are nothing new in US diplomacy.]{.underline}
Nevertheless, President [Trump is likely to take transactional diplomacy
to a new level. This new way of doing diplomacy is likely to change how
the world perceives the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and also how diplomacy is conducted more
broadly]{.underline}. Time will tell whose deals are actually the 'dumb'
ones.

For one, everyone understands now that policy, in **[Trump's Washington,

[U.S. allies also understand that even long-standing, previously
uncontroversial policies can change from one day to the
next]{.underline}. [South Koreans were]{.underline} reportedly

As a result, **[U.S. allies are now changing the way they speak to the
United States]{.underline}**. For one, [they now know that all
negotiation has to be done face to face, with the
president]{.underline}. It's no good sending envoys, or even foreign
ministers, since no one believes America's diplomats actually have
influence in the White House. Hence the appearance of both the president
of France and the chancellor of Germany in Washington last week: The
idea was to deliver a one-two punch, using different styles --- smiling
and serious, state visit and working visit, flamboyant French and
low-key German --- to deliver similar messages on trade as well as on
Iran.

U[.S. allies also know that any response has to find a way to reach the
president directly]{.underline}. [There is no]{.underline} substantive
[reason for the E.U. to put tariffs on bourbon and
motorcycl]{.underline}es; [the only justification is the hope that these
kinds of targeted punishments would create problems for congressional
Republicans, and]{.underline} thus [create a rift between the president
and congressional Republicans]{.underline}, [in the hope]{.underline}
that [congressional Republicans would put pressure on the
president.]{.underline} That's it.

What used to be a broad conversation has shrunk and narrowed. Everything
is personalized; [everything is transactional]{.underline}. There isn't
much discussion of what we can do together, just a show of strength:
[You hit us, we'll hit you back. That's how Europeans have had to learn
to deal with]{.underline} Vladimir [Putin]{.underline}, the president of
Russia, [and that's how they now deal with the United States,
too.]{.underline}

### Plan Most Important for Leadership

#### Plan is [more important]{.underline} than a strong military to sustain U.S. primacy

(6/1/2017, Patrick, "How Donald Trump betrayed American values and
Jeffersonian legacy with trip to Saudi Arabia; Patrick Mendis says the
transactional president is undermining US democratic ideals with his
economic determinism, as seen in his closeness to the Saudi kingdom,
which he previously condemned as a top funder of terrorism,"
<https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2096469/how-donald-trump-betrayed-american-values-and-jeffersonian>,
accessed on 6/8/19, JMP)

In his highly choreographed first overseas trip, President Donald Trump
appeared to have repeated president Richard Nixon's trip to Saudi Arabia
and other countries in the Middle East during the Watergate crisis some
33 years ago. Like Nixon, the returning chief American diplomat remains
entangled in a major scandal -- Trump's involving Russia.

Unlike Nixon, however, [Trump's choice of the Saudi kingdom as his first
stop not only undermined America's democratic allies but also
disregarded the founding Jeffersonian values of the
republic]{.underline}. His selection seemed to compensate for his
anti-Islam rhetoric and minimise his disastrous immigration policy of
banning Muslims from countries other than Egypt, Turkey and Saudi
Arabia, where the Trump family has business deals.

[Saudi Arabia has for years been considered one of the worst human
rights offenders.]{.underline} [The disoriented White House
has]{.underline} thus [mistakenly transmitted the exact antithesis of
American values on]{.underline} religious freedom, [human rights,
democracy]{.underline} and personal liberty [that would emphasise the
country's moral vision and current standing in the world]{.underline}.

**[Trump]{.underline}**, a former businessman, **[is a transactional
leader as opposed to a transformational one]{.underline}**. The Trump
White House, with political operatives as his brain trust, is a
hodgepodge of short-term tacticians, neither fully immersed in US
history nor in international affairs. Their policies appear to be
measured in pure financial terms.

[**The foundation of American primacy has, however, derived from the
reflective actions of "transformational" leaders** like]{.underline}
Franklin [Roosevelt]{.underline}, Harry [Truman and]{.underline} Ronald
[Reagan]{.underline}.

The current White House and State Department, with Trump's Secretary of
State Rex Tillerson -- ­another transactional businessman -- are being
questioned about their abilities to manage the complex ­organisations of
the US government, where, as designed, there is "nobody in charge," as
the late US statesman Harlan Cleveland put it.

Given all this, why did the White House choose the absolute Saudi
monarchy, whose strict sharia law -- the ­Islamic religious law Trump has
repeatedly denounced -- is ­inimical to American values and traditions?

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the financier and promoter of Salafism, a
Sunni movement that advocates the medieval traditions of the Prophet
Mohammed. These forms of Wahhabism in the Muslim faith are also being
exported through the madrassa school system -- the fountainhead of
Islamist terrorism around the globe. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers of the
9/11 attacks were Saudi citizens. The 9/11 Commission report found that
al-Qaeda, which masterminded the attacks under Osama bin Laden, raised
money from Saudi society. As a private citizen, Trump himself had called
Saudi Arabia "the world's biggest funder of terrorism".

**\[image of Trump tweet deleted\]**

Tillerson acknowledged the Saudi human rights problem at a congressional
hearing, followed by sending his "Country Reports on Human Rights
Practices", which documents human rights violations in the kingdom.

The Sunni kingdom neither tolerates religious worship by adherents of
other faiths nor allows women to drive. Homosexuality is punishable by
stoning to death. These sharia laws are hostile to the most conservative
views of Trump's electoral base of the Christian right.

In his recent speech at the State Department, [Tillerson argued that
American values must take a back seat while national security and
commercial interests drive]{.underline} President [Trump's "America
First" strategy]{.underline}. He maintains a US "foreign policy
projected with a strong ability to enforce the protection of our
freedoms with a strong military." For him, "we can only do that with
economic prosperity" as the Saudis, Russian and Chinese do.

Such **[economic determinism]{.underline}** with assorted other elements
of the "America First" plan -- like banning or deporting immigrants --
**[is a dramatic departure from America's ­Jeffersonian foreign policy
tradition of championing its founding values and protecting human
rights]{.underline}**.

[Trump is driven by money and motivated by instant
self-indulgence.]{.underline} When he first met President Xi Jinping
(習近平) in Florida, the North Korean nuclear issue and ­bilateral trade
concessions were purposefully linked for a possible deal. As the Trump
family has commercial interests in China, a transactional business
relationship seems to work well with Xi's "China First" strategy and the
"America First" plan. When it comes to Saudi Arabia, Trump has also
changed his rhetoric as he did with China.

**\[image of Trump tweet deleted\]**

Trump said, "Saudi Arabia -- and I get along great with all of them.
They buy apartments from me. They spend US\$40 million, US\$50 million.
Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them very much." His commercial
interactions with the Saudi royal family go back to the 1990s, when
Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Alsaud had helped "bail" him out after his
Plaza Hotel in New York and his Atlantic City casinos were struggling.

While in Riyadh, the US president signed a US\$110 billion arms deal.
Trump then said, "Until the Iranian regime is willing to be a partner
for peace, all nations of conscience must work together to isolate Iran,
deny it funding for terrorism."

Unlike Saudi Arabia, however, Iran -- a Shia Muslim nation -- was not
directly involved in terrorist attacks on American soil.

Trump described the Obama administration-led Iran nuclear treaty as "the
worse deal ever" and vowed "to dismantle the disastrous deal". Since
then, he has quietly ­allowed the over-US\$16 billion sale of 80 aircraft
to Iran by Boeing, arguing that that would create 18,000 jobs. He also
signed waivers to sanctions for Tehran to engage in business deals by
accessing funds frozen by the US government.

Unlike the civilisational societies of Saudi Arabia, Iran and even
China, the United States was created by an enlightened band of founding
fathers with a global vision for the new republic.

Welcoming immigrants from all corners of the globe, America has become
the world and the world is America. The Jeffersonian ideals embedded in
the Statue of Liberty -- a gift from the French -- and Ellis Island in
New York must be the bedrock of American foreign policy.

**[The Jeffersonian inspiration is the "invisible attraction" that makes
America stronger and more prosperous, not "a strong
military"]{.underline}** as Tillerson has argued. The most logical
rationale came from Trump's defence secretary, James
[Mattis]{.underline}, who [wisely remarked: "If you don't fully fund the
State Department, then I need to buy more ammunition
ultimately."]{.underline}

[The deal-making, transactional president must not forget]{.underline}
founding father and presidential forebear Thomas
[Jefferson]{.underline}, whose iconic memorial to the south of the White
House keeps a watchful eye on the chief diplomat in the Oval Office.

**[Indifference to Jeffersonian values and American foreign policy
tradition, which made America a great democratic nation, will have
associated consequences for the troubled presidency.]{.underline}**

## Solvency -- Leahy Law Mechanism

#### The United States federal government should strengthen and enforce the Leahy Law, requiring the suspension of Foreign Military Sales and Direct Commercial Sales of arms to military corps that violate human rights.

MR. ISACSON: Thank you very much and thank you, General Hooper. I'm Adam
Isacson from the Washington Office on Latin America

And just on the last answer on processes that drive you crazy, I'd like
to ask about the Leahy law, which is now codified in Title 10 and Title
22 prohibiting assistance to foreign military units that violate human
rights with impunity. Do [you feel that the Leahy law]{.underline} has,
after all these years, been sort of \-- the [vetting has been
institutionalized and it's now a smooth process?]{.underline}

And also, [it does not apply to foreign military sales. What would
change for you if it did?]{.underline}

GENERAL HOOPER: I think, by and large, I think that **[it has been
institutionalized]{.underline}**. I can go by **[my own experience as a
security cooperation officer. It was something that we did routinely and
it was mandatory that we do]{.underline}**.

[Countries]{.underline} often push back on it. They feel sometimes it's
an infringement on their sovereignty. But nevertheless, they [understand
that if they're doing business with the United States, this is something
that they have to participate in.]{.underline}

**[If it were applied to foreign military sales, we would adhere
strictly to the law]{.underline}** and move forward with that. And once
again, [I think this speaks to the integrity of the U.S. approach to
security cooperation that distinguishes us from our strategic
competitors]{.underline}. So if it were applied, [we would obey the
law.]{.underline} And you know what? [We'd still be successful and we'd
still be consistent with not only our interests, but our values, as
well.]{.underline}

#### A [strengthened]{.underline} and [enforced]{.underline} Leahy Law will ensure human rights protections and revive U.S. moral legitimacy

Conclusion

Foreign Military Financing is an important foreign policy tool. It
provides military strength to allies and gives the United States
additional leverage in dealing with foreign governments. Similarly,
training soldiers of other nations provides significant benefits to the
United States. Such training sharpens the military capacity of allies
and improves relationships between U.S. and foreign troops. If coupled
with effective human rights training, U.S. support is likely to prevent
some human rights abuses.

Unfortunately, it [is difficult to see how U.S. aid and training has
helped curtail human rights abuses committed by the militaries receiving
the funds]{.underline}. Afghanistan, the Philippines, and Colombia are
just three examples of nations that receive enormous sums in military
aid but disburse these sums in ways that may aggravate, rather than
prevent, human rights abuses. Sometimes, as with the Afghan Local Police
in Afghanistan and the paramilitaries in Colombia, those abuses border
on state policy. At other times, including the extrajudicial killings in
the Philippines, the human rights abuses are compounded by a systemic
failure to prosecute the perpetrators.

[The **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates often [claims to
be a beacon of freedom and democratic government]{.underline}. n263 Much
of its moral legitimacy in foreign affairs is \[\*695\] based upon its
efforts to ensure freedom and democracy around the world. [When its
allies]{.underline} are found to [commit human rights violations - with
the]{.underline} acquiescence or **[encouragement of U.S.
officials]{.underline}** - [it **undermines this moral
legitimacy**]{.underline}. And, [where]{.underline} the human rights
[violations are enabled]{.underline} even in part [by U.S. funding and
training]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [limits its own access to the moral high
ground.]{.underline}

The Leahy Law is an attempt to enhance U.S. moral legitimacy in foreign
affairs. As the law stands, however, it does a poor job. [Without
considerable changes]{.underline} in the language of the legislation,
[the Leahy Law will still be vulnerable to executive pushback against
congressional influence. Since history suggests that pushback is
inevitable, it is up to Congress to create a stronger law.]{.underline}

[One way for Congress to strengthen the Leahy Law would be to make
**larger segments** of the recipient military ineligible]{.underline}
for military aid. While this would deprive the Executive of some
operational flexibility, [it sends a **much stronger message** in favor
of human rights]{.underline}. **[To deny a recipient country all
military aid would greatly improve the deterrence effect of the Leahy
Law.]{.underline}** It would also effectively counter the problem of
arms being a fungible commodity. **[Even if the law were to define unit
at the division or corps level, it would more effectively secure
compliance with human rights norms.]{.underline}**

[Congress should]{.underline} also [eliminate the disparity in language
between the D]{.underline}efense [and]{.underline} [F]{.underline}oreign
[A]{.underline}id [A]{.underline}ppropriations [Bills.]{.underline}
Without violating the Leahy Law, [the Executive can arm **questionable
units** if Congress approves]{.underline} the funding under the Defense
Appropriations Bill. [If the law is not changed,]{.underline} [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will continue to
claim]{.underline} that [it cannot arm those who have committed human
rights violations while doing just that.]{.underline}

[The Judiciary needs a **defined role**]{.underline} in enforcing the
Leahy Law, and [without congressional action this is
**impossible**]{.underline}. Given the courts\' reluctance to become
involved in foreign affairs, **[Congress should clearly articulate the
boundaries of any potential cause of action. If those who have been
victimized]{.underline}** by units receiving U.S. funding **[can
sue]{.underline}** in federal court, **[it is much less likely that
units will commit human rights violations or that the Executive will
fund units that could commit human rights violations]{.underline}**.

Lastly, foreign military financing should be more transparent. In
addition to seeing which country receives funding, the public should see
how and on whom that money is spent. End-use monitoring should be
required \[\*696\] and publicized. After all, if the goal of the
legislation is to prevent U.S. tax dollars from funding those who commit
human rights violations, U.S. taxpayers should be able to see that the
objective is accomplished. And if the goal of the Leahy Law is to show
the world that the United States pays more than lip services to human
rights, the world should be able to see that the United States is
willing to stand by that commitment.

[The Leahy Law is a well-intentioned piece of legislation that could be
**drastically improved**.]{.underline} [Instead of being the latest
casualty in the long-running dispute between the Executive and Congress
in foreign policy decision-making, or a sop to the consciences of
concerned citizens, it should be **strengthened and
enforced**.]{.underline} **[It could be an important tool to enforce
human rights, direct congressional influence in foreign policy, and
increase U.S. moral legitimacy.]{.underline}** And it might save a few
lives.

#### Applying Leahy laws resolves U.S. complicity, boosts human rights leadership, allows for effective counterterror operations, and encourages material change in the behavior of countries---the law has [never]{.underline} prevented us from cooperating with an essential unit

Introduction

Thank you, Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Bass, and Members of the
Subcommittee. I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to share our
views on human rights vetting of potential recipients of U.S. security
assistance and the critical role it plays in advancing human rights and
U.S. national security.

We are grateful for your leadership, Mr. Chairman, on this and so many
other important human rights issues. You came to Congress at about the
same time that Human Rights First was born, and we've been working
together ever since. No one in the Congress--- and very few outside of
it---can match your passion and persistence. You are a constant reminder
to your colleagues that respect for human rights is not only the right
thing to do; it's the smart thing, too.

Human Rights First, the organization it's my privilege to lead, is built
on that idea. Our central mission is to foster American global
leadership on human rights. We believe that upholding human rights is
not only a moral obligation; it's a vital national interest. Our country
is strongest when our policies and actions match our ideals. For 35
years, we have worked to ensure that [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [acts as a beacon on
human rights in a world that sorely needs American
leadership.]{.underline}

[**Human rights vetting requirements---known as the Leahy Laws---are
absolutely critical to that leadership**.]{.underline}

When Secretary of State John Kerry rolled out the State Department's
Country Reports on Human Rights this year, he noted that, "[The places
where we face]{.underline} some of the [greatest national security
challenges]{.underline} today [are also places where governments
deny]{.underline} basic [human rights]{.underline} to their nations'
people, and [that is no coincidence."]{.underline}

As the United States expands its partnerships with foreign military and
security forces to counter new security threats---including
terrorism---it's important to keep this in mind. [Respect for human
rights is neither a trump that beats other national interests, nor a
**"soft" concern that can be traded** off]{.underline} or deferred
without undermining those very interests. [Respect for human rights
is]{.underline} rather [a **cornerstone**]{.underline}, a foundation [on
which to advance other national priorities]{.underline}.

While the United States serves its national interest when it lives up to
ideals, the converse is also true: it is evident from years of
experience that [U.S. **national security is degraded** when our
partners engage in abusive and predatory practices]{.underline}, as
we've seen in many places, including Nigeria, Kenya, Colombia, and Iraq.
Not only do [such actions **weaken U.S. moral
authority**]{.underline}---an increasingly under-valued resource---[they
alienate the civilian populations whose support is **essential in the
struggle against terrorism**]{.underline} and are [used by terrorists to
**validate grievances and recruit others** to their cause.]{.underline}

The Leahy Laws prevent the United States from offering assistance to
foreign military units if there is credible information that a member of
the unit has committed a gross violation of human rights---torture,
rape, murder, or indefinite arbitrary detention---and has not been
investigated or held accountable. It is a common-sense proposition, a
way to ensure that lethal aid only goes to law-abiding, responsible
partners. It's not only one of the most constructive pieces of human
rights legislation we have, [it's an insurance policy]{.underline}.
[Because of the Leahy Laws,]{.underline} [American leaders don't run the
risk of being **exposed as collaborators with criminals**.]{.underline}

The [Leahy Laws reduce]{.underline} the [chances that the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will become **complicit in
human rights violations**]{.underline} by keeping lethal equipment out
of the hands of those with a history of abuse. And **[having that
conditionality enshrined in law sends an important message to potential
partners]{.underline}** and others **[that the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[will not support or
condone such violations]{.underline}**. Under the U.N. Charter and the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the United
States is obligated "to promote universal respect for, and observance
of, human rights, and freedoms." The Leahy Laws help implement that
obligation in a meaningful way.

I'd like to focus on two other strategic objectives of the Leahy Laws
that underscore both its importance and its practical focus.

[The Leahy Law Promotes Accountability]{.underline}

In any country, [true accountability]{.underline} within security
services [depends on the capacity---and willingness---of civilian
institutions to act]{.underline}. The **[Leahy Laws encourage respect
for human rights by providing an incentive for foreign governments to
bring violators]{.underline}** in their security forces [**to
justice**.]{.underline}

The Leahy Laws set the standard. They establish in clear terms the
professional, rightsrespecting behavior the United States demands from
its partners. But the law alone doesn't ensure that our security
partners will hold abusive individuals and units accountable. [For the
law to be effective]{.underline}, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [must embed it in a broader human rights
strategy.]{.underline}

Proper training helps foster a culture of accountability, which is one
of the reasons that professionalizing partner forces is a key component
of our National Defense Strategy. Properly trained security forces will
understand the negative ramifications of human rights abuses and will
therefore be much less likely to commit them. Professionalism deters
abuse. So [the vetting process required by the Leahy Laws not only
encourages the development of justice mechanisms, when paired with
robust training and assistance programs it fosters professionalism
within security forces that makes their reliance on those mechanisms a
last resort]{.underline}.

In Bangladesh, for example, the United States carried out an interagency
effort to assess the failure to investigate and prosecute human rights
violations. The assessment focused on the Rapid Action Battalion, which
was denied military assistance through the Leahy Laws because of clear
evidence of human rights violations. The assessment represents a solid
first step to instill professionalization and allows Leahy-prohibited
units to overcome aid sanctions by holding abusers accountable.

The Leahy Law Promotes U.S. Security

The other strategic value of the Leahy Laws are their [contribution
to]{.underline} the conduct of [U.S. counterterrorism
operations]{.underline}. This is because [upholding human rights and
safeguarding security are **complementary**]{.underline} objectives.

[By encouraging]{.underline} foreign governments to institute
[counterterrorism policies **premised on the rule of
law**]{.underline}---[and by demanding accountability for human rights
violations]{.underline}---[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[creates the legitimacy needed for effective
counterterrorism]{.underline}** operations and [mitigates the conditions
that help give rise to violent extremism]{.underline}. To be sure,
terrorists may attempt to harm U.S. interests regardless of our conduct
but, because of the Leahy Laws, they are denied the public relations
benefit. It's worth noting that Osama bin Laden cited United States
support for regimes that violate human rights as a justification to
attack us[, calling]{.underline} the [abusive governments "agents" of
the United States]{.underline}.1 Today, [our largely unfettered aid to
governments]{.underline} like Egypt [is seen by many in the Middle East
as **approval of their abuses**.]{.underline}

As stated by the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights,
["effective counter-terrorism]{.underline} measures [and the protection
of human rights are complementary and **mutually reinforcing**
objectives]{.underline}."2 [Human rights-compliant counterterrorism
addresses]{.underline} both **[the short-term threat]{.underline}** of
terrorism [and works to remedy the **underlying conditions** that give
rise to terrorism]{.underline}.

[Consider Colombia]{.underline}, where [the Leahy Laws have resulted in
an improved human rights climate]{.underline} [and "gains
in]{.underline} security and [stability]{.underline}."3 Testifying
before Congress this year, Admiral McRaven cited Colombia as the best
example of a country where U.S. military assistance and training have
helped reform an abusive and ineffective foreign military. Indeed, the
situation in Colombia---a society plagued by government corruption and
conflict between the government and a violent insurgency---reflects the
challenges in many of today's fragile states.

The U.S. Embassy in Bogotá has fully embraced the Leahy Laws, with two
full-time staff positions dedicated to vetting 30,000 to 35,000
individuals annually.4 None of this was easy, and Leahy vetting is not a
panacea. But a decade of effort and targeted aid have spurred
improvements as the Colombian Government continues to take action
against many violators of human rights.5

[The Leahy Law is Not an Obstacle to Pursuing our Security
Goals]{.underline}

[Some]{.underline}---including in the military and the Congress---[have
expressed concerns that the Leahy Laws create an obstacle to our
security goals]{.underline} because they bar the United States from
equipping security forces on the frontlines of conflicts, such as in
Nigeria. The logic behind this position is that in some conflicts there
are no good options, [and that]{.underline}, in service of a larger
objective against a bigger threat, [the United States may need to
tolerate units that have committed abuses.]{.underline}

With all due respect, Mr. Chairman, [this argument is
wrong]{.underline}. **[Let's not conflate the need to work with
governments and militaries that have questionable human rights records
with what the Leahy Law is intended to prevent.]{.underline}** No matter
what lens you view it through, [it is never in America's interest to arm
or train or partner with]{.underline} individuals or [units]{.underline}
that are credibly [believed to have committed torture, rape, or other
such heinous crimes.]{.underline}

[**The problem isn't the Leahy Laws**: the problem is security units
that **perpetrate and tolerate abuse**]{.underline}. **[Human rights
vetting is the tripwire that enables us to avoid arming
them]{.underline}**, training them, and---ultimately---**[undermining
our strategic objectives]{.underline}**. [To blame human rights vetting
is to **blame the messenger** of bad---and
essential---news.]{.underline} [The United States needs to know when
security forces]{.underline}, because of their human rights records, [do
not have the trust of their own population.]{.underline} In the case of
Nigeria, the abuses of some in the security forces have helped fuel the
growth of Boko Haram.

In addition, as far as I understand from the State Department and
well-placed Members of Congress, the **[Leahy Laws have never prevented
the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[from engaging in
an essential operation]{.underline}**. **[There has always been a more
reliable, rights-respecting alternative.]{.underline}**

I also understand your credible concern, Mr. Chairman, that the Leahy
Laws may end up wrongfully disqualify eligible soldiers---good people
who share our goals and seek our support. Such individuals should not be
covered under Leahy, and in fact, [it is not uncommon for a **new unit
to be created** with the sole purpose of excluding abusers]{.underline}.
Not only [should we cooperate with soldiers who share our goals, we
should also be working with them to **demand accountability** for those
accused of crimes.]{.underline}

I suspect that [the belief]{.underline} in some quarters [that human
rights vetting is a hindrance]{.underline} rather than a help in the
country's battle against terrorism and other security threats [grows out
of a failure to recognize its value]{.underline}. [In the face of
danger, the big picture gets lost]{.underline}, and human rights
[vetting comes to seem like do-goodism that can be
disregarded]{.underline} in the interest of national security. But [we
should reject the temptation to cut moral and legal
corners]{.underline}. The [Leahy Laws derive from the bipartisan
commitment to our country's ideals]{.underline}. We need to remember
that [those ideals are a vital national security asset]{.underline}, and
that [when we ally ourselves with those who undermine human rights, we
endanger ourselves]{.underline}.

#### The plan would ensure the effective execution of Leahy Laws

years of service as an Infantry and Foreign Area Officer (6/29/17,

accessed on 6/21/19, JMP)

[The protection of human rights has long been a core component of global
security.]{.underline} In advancing this principle, the United States
has sought to limit security cooperation with foreign security forces
that violate human rights and in 1997 passed legislation to prevent the
State and Defense Departments from using taxpayer money to provide
training and equipment to foreign security forces that commit gross
violations of human rights. [The Leahy laws]{.underline}, as they are
known, [contain two provisions: one restricts funds and an exception
allows for the resumption of funds if a foreign government is taking
measures to bring violators to justice.]{.underline}

Over time, in an effort to comply with the laws, the State and Defense
Departments have suspended U.S. cooperation with foreign security forces
when credible information of violations were found. But counter to the
laws and their intent, once cooperation was terminated, there was no
remediation mechanism through which foreign security forces could regain
favorable status. It became common to say that once a unit was on the
"withheld" list, it would remain there forever. Discussing individual
cases with foreign governments was not always encouraged; it was
sometimes expressly prohibited, to the detriment of foreign relations.
In one particular instance, after a foreign government repeatedly
attempted to obtain more information on why it had been defunded, it
began canceling some joint military engagements with the United States.
Human rights became more or less a forbidden topic of discussion with
some countries, and the military-to-military and broader
government-to-government relationships became strained.

In the summer of 2013, a small group of U.S. military officers and
Defense Department civilians decided to independently analyze the case
files of some foreign military units whose funding had been halted.
Their findings revealed considerable variance in how the Leahy laws were
implemented. In some cases, the State and Defense Departments cut off
funds to the wrong unit. In others, the information or sources that led
to the allegation were questionable or unverifiable. And in still
others, when a violation had occurred and the foreign government had
brought the case to trial with convictions, U.S. funding remained
restricted. Years of ineffective implementation of the Leahy laws led to
a sizable list of barred units that could not receive training. To
illustrate the extent of the problem, in one country alone, the State
and Defense Departments erroneously denied funding to more than 40
security force units, which equaled roughly 15 percent of that country's
military forces.

The Defense Department team conducting this research focused much of its
attention on cases where foreign governments had taken judicial action
in response to human rights violations. The Leahy laws permit the State
and Defense Departments to resume cooperative activities with the
security force units in question once certain measures have been taken
against perpetrators, such as judicial action. But for decades, no
policy or procedures existed to implement this part of the law. After a
year and a half of research, meetings, dialogue with foreign nations,
and political wrangling in Washington, the State and Defense Departments
issued a joint policy guidance that addressed the remediation of
defunded foreign security force units, in compliance with the Leahy
laws. The new policy was signed and published in February 2015. In order
to resume U.S. funding, the policy requires State and Defense Department
personnel to document that the foreign government has completed a
credible investigation, judicial or administrative review, and, if
warranted, judicial or administrative action in response to a gross
violation of human rights. Later that year, for the first time, the
State and Defense Departments restored funding to three units, each from
three separate countries. To date, the Defense Department has resumed
security cooperation funding to a total of seven foreign security force
units under the remediation provision of the Leahy laws.

Nonetheless, [implementation of the new joint State and Defense
Department remediation policy, as well as broader human rights vetting
procedures, remains uneven. Many officials at both departments are
unaware of the new policy, and many do not know how to use it. Neither
department offers training on how to use remediation as an effective
foreign policy tool. Unless the new policy is fully understood and
incorporated into standard procedures at both departments, the old
problems will persist.]{.underline} The common practices of suspending
security cooperation funding in response to every allegation, whether
proven credible or not, and continuing to withhold funds even if a
foreign government is taking effective steps to bring violators to
justice, weaken the impact of the Leahy laws. [Unexplained suspensions
of security force units hinder the advancement of shared foreign policy
objectives because **the U.S. government loses the trust of partner
nations when it fails to serve as an honest broker on security and human
rights issues**.]{.underline}

There are several steps the State and Defense Departments can take to
ensure they are properly implementing the Leahy laws. First, the two
departments should call for a review of all cases in which security
cooperation funds are suspended or rejected. This review will verify the
quality of existing withholdings and could identify cases eligible for
remediation. Both departments should give priority to remediation,
including open and honest engagement with partner nations.

In addition, [the State and Defense Departments should update and
disseminate, based on input from practitioners in the field, **revised
policies and procedures on how to manage human rights vetting in order
to ensure current U.S. policy is implemented in a coherent and
consistent manner**.]{.underline} [Existing challenges include the lack
of standards for determining if the source reporting a human rights
violation is credible.]{.underline} There is also no standard in
determining whether the unit itself or every individual in the unit must
undergo vetting or what level of leadership is permitted to approve or
withhold U.S. funding to a foreign security force unit.
[Once]{.underline} such [guidance is clarified, it should be codified in
State and Defense Department operating procedures]{.underline}.

Both the State and Defense Departments must also address ongoing
misunderstandings about which department is accountable for implementing
the Leahy laws. Both departments are separate but equal collaborators in
implementing them. Therefore, even if the State Department oversees the
administrative aspects of human rights vetting for both departments, the
Defense Department needs to remain informed at every level and phase of
that process when it involves Defense Department--funded activities, and
vice versa. While these procedures are put in place, the State and
Defense Departments should ensure training is available to officials at
all levels who are responsible for human rights vetting decisions. This
training should involve studying best practices and techniques for
working with partner nations.

[Congress]{.underline} also [plays a role in ensuring the Leahy laws are
properly implemented. It should provide both the State and Defense
Departments with sufficient resources to undertake the very technical
and time-intensive work of vetting human rights violations, as well as
sufficient funds to ensure department personnel are properly trained to
implement the laws**.**]{.underline} Both departments spend billions of
dollars per year on security cooperation activities worldwide but spend
only a fraction of a percent of this amount on implementation of the
human rights vetting required.

**[Professional and capable armed forces that respect and protect human
rights are critical to the long-term stability and security of
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[**and its global partners**. In advancing this issue, the U.S.
government should not only continue to **limit security cooperation with
nations that violate human rights but also renew support and cooperation
with those that hold violators accountable**.]{.underline}

### Leahy Law Doesn't Apply to FMS / DCS

#### Government-to-government transfers are currently covered by the Leahy Law but it doesn't cover [commercial sales]{.underline} reviewed by the State Department 

**Toombs, et. al, 12** \-\-- managing editor for national security at
the Center for Public Integrity (6/21/2012, Zach Toombs, Center for
Public Integrity, R. Jeffrey Smith, "Why Is the U.S. Selling Billions in
Weapons to Autocrats? The export of American arms to countries around
the world \-- even those actively repressing their own citizens \-- is

accessed on 5/25/19, JMP)

[Every May and June, different branches of the State Department paint
contrasting portraits of how Washington views dozens of strategically
significant countries around the world]{.underline}, in seemingly
rivalrous reports by its Human Rights and Political-Military Affairs
bureaus.

[The former routinely criticizes other nations for a lack of fealty to
democratic principles, citing abuses of the right to expression,
assembly, speech, and political choice. The latter tallies the
government's latest successes in the export of American weaponry, often
to the same countries criticized by the former.]{.underline}

This year was no different. The State Department's Military Assistance
Report on June 8 stated that it approved \$44.28 billion in arms
shipments to 173 nations in the last fiscal year, including some that
struggled with human rights problems. These nations include the United
Arab Emirates, Qatar, Israel, Djibouti, Honduras, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
and Bahrain.

Three nations with records of suppressing democratic dissent in the last
year --- Algeria, Egypt, and Peru --- are listed in the report as
recently receiving U.S. firearms, armored vehicles, and items from a
category that includes chemical and riot control agents like tear gas.
The State Department confirmed that U.S. tear gas was delivered to Egypt
up to the end of November, but has declined to confirm it was also sent
to Algeria and Peru.

The export of American arms to countries around the world --- what the
State Department calls a tangible expression of American "partnership"
--- is in fact booming. The commercial arms sales reviewed by the State
Department reached \$44.28 billion in fiscal year 2011, a \$10 billion
sales increase since 2010. Next year should see another increase of 70
percent, the department says.

Those sales --- plus the government-to-government arms exports overseen
by the Pentagon --- make the United States the world's top provider of
major conventional weapons, according to the Stockholm International
Peace Research Institute. Russia, France, and China followed behind.
Much of the recent U.S. increase came from vastly expanded sales to
Saudi Arabia, Brazil and India.

"Obviously, we're going to continue to press and advocate for U.S. arms
sales," said Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of Political-Military
Affairs Andrew Shapiro in a June 14 news conference addressing arms
exports. "We are hopeful that arms sales to India will increase. We've
made tremendous progress in this relationship over the last decade."

Shapiro explained that by "progress" he meant that U.S. arms sales to
India went from "nearly zero" to around \$8 billion in that period.

Here's what the May 24 report issued by State's Bureau of Democracy,
Human Rights and Labor said about India: "The most significant human
rights problems were police and security force abuses, including
extrajudicial killings, torture, and rape; widespread corruption at all
levels of government; and separatist, insurgent, and societal violence.
Other human rights problems included disappearances, poor prison
conditions that were frequently life threatening, arbitrary arrest and
detention, and lengthy pretrial detention."

India is not alone in getting U.S. arms sales pitches at the same time
Washington points at rights abuses. "When we deem that cooperating with
an ally or partner in the security sector will advance our national
security, we advocate tirelessly on behalf of U.S. \[arms
manufacturing\] companies," Shapiro said.

**[No law requires that U.S. arms be exported only to countries that the
State Department -- in its annual human rights assessments -- determines
are treating their citizens well.]{.underline}** Instead, a more narrow
restriction known as [the]{.underline} so-called ["Leahy
Law,"]{.underline} named for author Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and passed
in 1997, [prohibits U.S. assistance to specific military and police
units deemed responsible for human rights abuses]{.underline}.

Moreover, as Leahy spokesman David Carle pointed out in an interview,
**[the law only covers direct government-to-government transfers
overseen by the Defense Department, a stream of exports separate from
the commercial sales reviewed and approved by the State
Department]{.underline}**. So, [although the Defense
Department's]{.underline} \$34.8 billion in [direct
government-to-government sales are covered by the Leahy Law, the \$44.28
billion in sales authorized by State are not]{.underline}.

Adotei [Akwei, the managing director of Amnesty International's
government relations efforts, said that "In all of these countries,
**there's a need for a much more rigorous process for looking at where
these weapons are going and how they're being used. Even though the
State Department identifies problems, we still see these sales taking
place over and over again. There's a much-exemplified disconnect between
the identifying of abuse and the sales."**]{.underline}

US Laws

[The domestic regulation of international arms transfers by
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [is
governed primarily by two sources of legislation: The Arms Export
Control Act and the Foreign Assistance Act]{.underline}. The Arms Export
Control act designates the regulatory authority for arms sales to the
executive branch and sets important thresholds for congressional
notification of sales and violations of the terms of sale, while the
Foreign Assistance Act clarifies the purposes for and circumstances
under which arms may or may not be sold under its authority.

[The]{.underline} Arms Export Control Act [(AECA) grants the President
"the authority to control the import and export of defense articles and
defense services and to provide foreign policy guidance to persons of
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[involved in the export and import of such articles and
services]{.underline}." 54 [This authority was delegated to the
Secretary of State]{.underline} via Executive Order 11958, where it
currently resides, **[making the State Department the principal
regulatory agency for international arms sales]{.underline}**. 55 The
AECA stipulates that decisions on arms exports "shall take into account
whether the export of an article would contribute to an arms race, aid
in the development of weapons of mass destruction, support international
terrorism, increase the possibility of outbreak or escalation of
conflict, or prejudice the development of bilateral or multilateral arms
control or nonproliferation agreements or other arrangements." 56 The
law also requires the President to report to Congress any potential
violations of the AECA. However, while the law was in part intended to
provide Congressional oversight over arms transfers, Congress has never
successfully blocked a proposed arms sale by appealing to the AECA
through a joint resolution of disapproval (a process elaborated in Part
2). 57

[While the AECA makes no explicit reference to IHL or human rights, it
does stipulate that "sales be approved only when they are consistent
with the foreign policy interests of the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, \[[and\] the purposes
of the foreign assistance program of the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [as embodied in the
Foreign Assistance Act]{.underline} (FAA) of 1961." The FAA clarifies
that defense items regulated under the AECA may be furnished:

\...solely for internal security (including for antiterrorism and
nonproliferation purposes), for legitimate self-defense, to permit the
recipient country to participate in regional or collective arrangements
or measures consistent with the Charter of the United Nations, or
otherwise to permit the recipient country to participate in collective
measures requested by the United Nations for the purpose of maintaining
or restoring international peace and security, or for the purpose of
assisting foreign military forces in less developed friendly countries
(or the voluntary efforts of personnel of the Armed Forces of the United
States in such countries) to construct public works and to engage in
other activities helpful to the economic and social development of such
friendly countries. 58

Importantly, [section 620M of the FAA also clearly applies to defense
articles and services transferred under the authority of the AECA. Known
as the "Leahy law," section 620M restricts assistance to security force
units or individuals credibly associated with the commission of a gross
violation of human rights.]{.underline} These include "torture or cruel,
inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, prolonged detention
without charges and trial, causing disappearance of persons by the
abduction and clandestine detention of those persons, and other flagrant
denial of the right of life, liberty, or the security of person," as
well as "war crimes, crimes against humanity, and evidence of acts that
may constitute genocide." 59 [However, at present, DSCA Policy 16-32
only requires the unit designation]{.underline} (i.e., which foreign
security force unit the item will go to, necessary for Leahy review)
[for units that will receive equipment or services under the Foreign
Military Financing]{.underline} (FMF) [program, a small subset of the
purchases that go through the FMS process.]{.underline} 60 **[In
practice, the State Department does not restrict commercial arms sales
on the basis of human rights violations to comply with the Leahy
law.]{.underline}**

extrajudicial killing, (3) enforced disappearance, or (4) rape under
color of law (in which a perpetrator abuses their official position to
commit rape). [In order to comply with the laws, the State Department
leads a process of unit-level GVHR vetting before providing security
assistance, including training and equipping.]{.underline} **[The Leahy
Laws, however, do not define security assistance; in practice, the
executive branch considers the term to mean support provided with
U.S.-appropriated funds and, in its view, the restrictions are thus not
applicable to FMS or DCS.]{.underline}**

### Leahy Not Enforced Now

#### Leahy can't effectively achieve its human rights goals now because of the bureaucracy in the State department

[Leahy has achieved a surprising level of success toward its two key
goals: (1) preventing disbursement of U.S. military assistance to human
rights abusers in foreign security forces; and (2) encouraging
investigations and prosecutions of human rights abusers in foreign
security forces]{.underline}. 110 [However]{.underline}, the statute
relies exclusively on the State Department for enforcement,
[**entrusting State Department bureaucrats to make Leahy
determinations** where foreign policy and national security
considerations will regularly weigh against robust Leahy enforcement.
The State Department\'s unfettered control over the statutory
enforcement mechanism **creates a conflict of interest that has
undermined Leahy\'s goals.**]{.underline} 112

Compared with § 2304, [Leahy\'s vetting and aid prohibition mechanisms
have made significant inroads toward Leahy\'s dual goals of barring aid
to abusive security forces and coercing anti-impunity
efforts.]{.underline}113 [Nevertheless, **Leahy has been unable to fully
realize its goals due to uneven enforcement**]{.underline}.114 [Leahy\'s
dependence on the State Department, an entity dedicated to executing the
President\'s foreign policy and national security policies, is the
Achilles\' heel in fully achieving Leahy\'s goals.]{.underline}115

[Despite Leahy\'s surprising human rights achievements, foreign

Leahy\'s provisions [continue to violate human rights]{.underline}.96
Similarly, [**human rights abusers are not always brought to justice

enforcement is not the appropriate standard by which to judge Leahy; [it
is an aspirational statute, and its enforcement implicates significant

that follows demonstrates that Leahy, [**relying only on the State
Department\'s enforcement and congressional oversight, cannot achieve
the laudable human rights goals** it was enacted to accomplish without
statutory reform.]{.underline}9 9

[**When foreign policy** and national security interests **clash with
human rights concerns**, the **executive branch will invariably bend
human rights standards**]{.underline}.116 National Security Advisor
Susan Rice boldly stated that human rights advocates should not count on
the executive branch to uphold human rights standards in the face of
national security concerns:

\[W\]e sometimes face painful dilemmas when the immediate need to defend
our national security clashes with our fundamental commitment to
democracy and human rights. Let\'s be honest at times, as a result, we
do business with governments that do not respect the rights we hold most
dear. We make tough choices. When rights are violated, we continue to
advocate for their protection. But we cannot, and I will not pretend
that some short-term tradeoffs do not exist.117

Ms. [Rice suggests that at times the State Department may simply
disregard human rights requirements, such as Leahy, but more often than
not, **the results are more subtle**.]{.underline}118

[Even with Congress\'s best efforts to draft Leahy to ensure proper
enforcement, **the State Department created ambiguities in the
statute\'s language to allow for less restrictive enforcement** when
foreign policy and national security considerations trump Leahy\'s human
rights concerns]{.underline}. 119 [For example, despite congressional
efforts to clarify the term \"credible,\" the State Department
manipulates its definition to ensure enforcement
flexibility]{.underline}.120 [Similarly, the State Department\'s view of
what constitutes effective steps to investigate and punish perpetrators
of human rights abuses varies arbitrarily.]{.underline} 121 Not
surprisingly, [there is not unanimity in the State Department regarding
Leahy enforcement]{.underline}. 1 22 The Democracy, Rights, and Labor
Bureau\'s opinion on Leahy enforcement predictably can be at variance
with the view of the Western Hemisphere Bureau.123

Broadening Leahy enforcement beyond the narrow confines of the State
Department, where non-human rights considerations may corrupt the
process, would provide a correction for some of these enforcement
problems.124 A private cause of action to enjoin the State Department to
enforce Leahy would significantly reduce the risk of weak Leahy
enforcement while empowering human rights victims.12 Absent a private
cause of action, Leahy has relied on strong congressional oversight and
transparent reporting on Leahy vetting decisions to pressure the State
Department to robustly enforce existing Leahy Law mechanisms. 126

Aggressive Congressional Involvement in Leahy Enforcement is Not a
LongTerm Solution for Robust Enforcement

Congress has played an aggressive role in ensuring Leahy is more
successful than § 2304, but Congress\'s oversight limitations suggest
the need for judicial review.1 27 Congress has shown a keen interest in
improving Leahy\'s effectiveness, extending and amending the law to
mitigate concerns. 1 28 Meanwhile, members of Congress, specifically
Senator Leahy himself, have provided aggressive oversight over Leahy
enforcement, even unilaterally suspending aid to ensure Leahy compliance
when the State Department has failed to properly enforce the statute.129
[While Congress\'s substantial engagement with Leahy has ensured the
legislation is more effective than § 2304, there are limitations to
these avenues, and only a statutory remedy that allows for judicial
review of Leahy enforcement can ensure proper oversight.]{.underline}130

Congress has adapted Leahy on numerous occasions to improve its
effectiveness, including significant amendments in 2011 and 2014 aimed
at addressing a serious flaw in the statute, but absent judicial review,
Leahy\'s enforcement problems will continue.131 [Human rights
organizations raised concerns that the State Department was releasing
security assistance to tainted units by vetting only the individual
troops within the unit that would receive assistance, such as
training.]{.underline}13 2 In response, Congress took statutory action
to reverse the State Department\'s interpretation that an individual
could be considered a unit. This statutory reform closed a loophole
exploited by the State Department, but failed to address [the underlying
problem: **depending exclusively on the State Department, with its
inherent conflict of interest, for Leahy enforcement**. Recognizing the
inherent problems independent State Department enforcement presents and
the failure of statutory amendments aimed at perfecting Leahy\'s
language to ensure robust State Department enforcement, Congress, and
Senator Leahy specifically, has taken on an unusually active oversight
role.]{.underline}

#### Leahy Law is unenforceable now---only the courts can solve

If Senator Leahy believed the State Department could be trusted to
effectively enforce Leahy, then his vigorous oversight of the State
Department\'s Leahy enforcement would be unnecessary.\'\" However,
Senator [Leahy, who wields significant power over the State
Department\'s budget and foreign assistance generally, has taken
advantage of his unique position to pressure the State
Department]{.underline}.137 He has served as either the chairman or the

Foreign Operations, and Related Programs for over twenty years, a

cases, security assistance has continued in an apparent violation of
Leahy]{.underline}.141 [Second, **a single Senator,** no matter how

[systemic flaws that lead to]{.underline} the [lack of enforcement of
the Leahy Law]{.underline}, given the deference to the Executive on
matters of foreign policy, it [is highly unlikely to lead to a
constitutional impasse]{.underline}.

Nor do Members of Congress have standing to sue. In Raines v. Byrd, [the
Supreme Court denied Members of Congress the ability to challenge laws
based upon a **diminution of congressional power**]{.underline}. n257
The Court said that, \"appellees have alleged no injury to themselves as
individuals, the institutional injury they allege is wholly abstract and
widely dispersed, and their attempt to litigate this dispute at this
time and in this form is contrary to historical experience.\" n258

[With respect to the Leahy Law]{.underline} itself, [a District Court
gave two reasons in denying]{.underline} Representative [Kucinich\'s
suit to stop U.S. military action in Libya that cut]{.underline}
[against any congressional suits to enforce the Leahy Law.]{.underline}
The [first was the ability of the legislators to seek a legislative
remedy]{.underline}, n259 and the second was congressional action, n260
in this case voting against de-funding the Libyan intervention. [Since a
legislative remedy to a lack of enforcement]{.underline} of the Leahy
[Law is theoretically available]{.underline} [and there have been
successive]{.underline} appropriations [bills passed that have had the
effect of fundi]{.underline}ng \[\*694\] [the military units at
issue]{.underline}, [it is]{.underline} **[highly
unlikely]{.underline}** [that a suit]{.underline} brought by Members of
Congress [will survive a challenge.]{.underline}

[Due to the difficulty in tracking FMF to a particular unit, and
therefore the impossibility of demonstrating]{.underline} that the [U.S.
arms and training were the **cause** of a]{.underline} [specific
injury]{.underline}, [it is]{.underline} similarly [unlikely that other
groups of plaintiffs will have standing to sue.]{.underline} The Supreme
Court ruled, in Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War,
that unless a citizen has been personally injured \"standing to sue may
not be predicated upon an interest \... which is held in common by all
members of the public, because of the necessarily abstract nature of the
injury all citizens share.\" n261 Further, in United States v.
Richardson, [the Supreme]{.underline} [Court ruled that taxpayers did
not have standing to sue]{.underline} because \"to invoke judicial power
the claimant must have a \'personal stake in the outcome,\' or a

### Leahy Should Apply to FMS

#### Leahy laws should be applied to all FMS and DCS sales

Furthermore, if H.R. 7080 is reintroduced in the 116thCongress, it
should be resurfaced alongside a host of [measures to strengthen
Congress's hand in overall arms export policy]{.underline}. These can
include requiring detailed and unclassified answers from the departments
of State and Defense concerning the likelihood that a sale of certain
items will exacerbate armed conflict or spur an arms race (theoretically
a judgment the executive already makes under AECA) and outlining robust
processes for monitoring the way weapons' are used among recipients with
a history of rights violations or violations of the laws of armed
conflict, and those for which the indicators suggest a high risk of
future violations. Congress should also consider lowering notification
thresholds, so that members can vet arms sales valued at less than \$50
million. **[The time is]{.underline}** also **[long past for Congress to
unequivocally clarify that the Leahy Law applies to]{.underline}**
Foreign Military Sales (**[FMS]{.underline}**) **[and]{.underline}**
Direct Commercial Sales (**[DCS]{.underline}**), **[thereby prohibiting
State and Defense from permitting the transfer or maintenance of defense
articles to security forces that have committed unconscionable human
rights violations with impunity]{.underline}**.

2\. Employ, and therefore strengthen, existing legislation: [Congress
should more regularly invoke the AECA for risky or concerning sales,
including by asking for State and DoD's analysis of the parameters
required in the AECA]{.underline} (e.g., contributing to an arms race or
escalating conflict) [and by asking for reports on potential violations
of the AECA, particularly on the basis of use or behavior. Congress
should clarify its intent that existing authorities include compliance
with international humanitarian and human rights obligations as a
condition of export. **Congress should also require that the Departments
of State and Defense apply the Leahy Law to Foreign Military
Sales.**]{.underline}

Over the last decade, **[we have professionalized our Leahy vetting
process]{.underline}**. [We have created a system where every day around
the world our embassies are vetting units, vetting individual
participants in our military training programs.]{.underline}

In fact, [we are now vetting 180,000 units and individuals every single
year]{.underline}, considering both DOD and State Department assistance.
**[We have doubled down on what we call "Leahy outreach," explaining the
Leahy law and the vetting process to our partners at DOD and our
embassies worldwide.]{.underline}**

Over the last year, our little Human Rights Bureau's leadership has
visited every U.S. military combatant command, apart from UCOM, and many
of our embassies and consulates overseas to address and resolve Leahy
concerns as they come up.

**[We have also focused on teaching and modeling what we call "Leahy
diplomacy." The whole point of the law is to prompt a discussion with
our foreign partners on how we can help them develop institutions of
accountability.]{.underline}**

[I've used Leahy diplomacy many times all over the world.]{.underline} A
good recent example, [I was in Sri Lanka in 2009, where the armed forces
of that country under what was then a much more authoritarian
government]{.underline}, finished off a domestic insurgency, the Tamil
Tigers, in a terrible kind of final orgy of bloodletting, in which
thousands and thousands of civilians were killed, many people taken
prisoner, executed.

Our relationship with Sri Lanka was estranged for a number of years as a
result of this because we joined international calls for accountability.
We now have a very different government, democratically elected
government in Sri Lanka, that is committed to democracy and human
rights, and that has worked with us at the United Nations to make joint
commitments to hold perpetrators of human rights abuses on both sides of
that conflict accountable.

So, [we want to help Sri Lanka]{.underline}. We want to provide all
kinds of assistance. [We want to rebuild a full and complete and
unfettered relationship between our military and the Sri Lankan
military.]{.underline}

At the same time, [**we have to insist that these past cases of human
rights abuses are addressed, and the Leahy law gives us a great way to
do that** because it does allow us over time to restart assistance and
cooperation with the military while again focusing on those units and
individuals that were most problematic.]{.underline}

The fact that it is a law enables me, as I did a few weeks ago, to sit
down with the heads of the Sri Lankan Navy, Air Force, and Army, to say
here's what you have to do, and if you support your civilian
government's commitments to start a legal process to investigate these
allegations and to hold people accountable, here's what we are going to
be able to do to help you, and that's not just me speaking about our
policy preferences, it is the law in the United States.

They understand and respect that this is something we have to do. We
can't get around it. That actually helps us a great deal.

We have used that stick, but we have also given our partners an off
ramp. One of the objectives of the law is to encourage something that we
call "remediation," and [we now have a formal policy for the remediation
of units that had previously been denied assistance under the Leahy
law]{.underline}, a policy that we have agreed to after a lot of careful
work with the Department of Defense.

[It's basically a roadmap that will show a foreign military force, if
this unit is having trouble receiving U.S. training, here are the
specific steps that it can take in order to in effect get off of that
black list.]{.underline}

We launched this policy last year. We now have a number of cases where
units have gone through the policy and been restored into the light, as
one might say.

[A good example where we have used this effectively is in
Afghanistan]{.underline}. Four cases in the last year. Because [the
Afghan government credibly investigated, prosecuted and punished
individual members of its security force units responsible for human
rights abuses, we are now able to work again with those remediated
units.]{.underline}

During his first visit as President to Washington in 2015, the Afghan
President, Ashraf Ghani, publicly and privately vowed to combat abuses
by his security forces and to hold perpetrators accountable. Last year,
the Afghan Ministry of Interior established a special commission to
track, evaluate, and finalize action on these kinds of cases. The Afghan
MOI and the Defense Ministry are finalizing plans for a new agency, the
Afghan Human Rights Ombudsman, and so on.

[These are all very concrete results of a partnership between the United
States and a foreign security partner in which we have used these
**provisions in U.S. law to try to incentivize reforms** and steps that
are very much in its own interest and the right thing to
do.]{.underline}

An increasingly well-known U.S. human rights law barring American
military assistance to foreign security forces that commit crimes like
murder, kidnapping, rape, and torture has played an important role in
encouraging Central and South American countries to crack down on these
crimes.

[The Leahy Law]{.underline}, named after Senator Patrick Leahy
(D-Vermont) and approved by Congress in the late 1990s, isn't designed
just to penalize a country. It [provides an incentive to foreign
military and police to clean up dirty units and seek justice for victims
of heinous crimes.]{.underline} [If the recipient government takes
"effective steps to bring the responsible members of the security forces
unit to justice," the U.S. government can resume assistance to that
unit.]{.underline} If no justice occurs, aid to that unit cannot resume.

Foreign governments are apt to comply with the Leahy Law because the
United States is the world's most sought-after military trainer and arms
supplier.

[For the Leahy Law to be effective]{.underline}, however, [awareness and
active participation by local human rights organizations is
required]{.underline}. That's why [the Latin America Working Group
Education Fund and the Center for International Policy have published a
concise, easy-to-use guide to **help human rights activists around the
globe**]{.underline} (as U.S. military assistance is global). For Latin
American activists, the guide is available in Spanish.

The guide explains how to report a Leahy Law violation, what kind of
evidence is needed, how to verify whether a unit has received U.S.
training or funding, and how the law's implementation has recently been
improved. Additional resources on U.S. military aid can be found at
Security Assistance Monitor. This project is designed to enhance civil
society's role in exposing human rights violations.

[**The Leahy Law has had some noteworthy successes.** In the past
decade, citizens in several Central and South American countries have
seen their governments bring perpetrators to justice in order to receive
U.S. security assistance.]{.underline} Much more, of course, must be
done to bring these security forces fully in compliance with human
rights standards.

In 2012, in Honduras, Juan Carlos "El Tigre" Bonilla was promoted to
national director of police. But several human rights organizations
produced evidence that Bonilla had ordered extrajudicial killings a
decade ago in San Pedro Sula. Meanwhile, [news articles in the United
States revealed that units under Bonilla's command were receiving U.S.
assistance]{.underline}. In 2013, a year after taking command, Bonilla
resigned under pressure, fearing that the U.S. would be forced to cut
off all security assistance to the Honduran police.

In 2011, a Guatemalan court convicted four members of the Kabiles, an
elite special forces unit in the Guatemalan army, of killing more than
200 civilians in the Dos Erres massacre in 1982. Each man was sentenced
to 6,050 years in prison. Their convictions for their roles in the
massacre nearly 30 years prior, in which army soldiers killed more than
200 men, women, and children, would not have happened if not for the
courage of victims of violence and Guatemala's attorney general, Claudia
Paz y Paz.

After the convictions of the Dos Erres four, based on a Guatemalan
government's commitment to reorganize its special forces units, the U.S.
Department of Defense resumed military aid.

[Finally, the Leahy Law played a part in helping to halt thousands of
extrajudicial executions by the Colombian army]{.underline}. Largely
between 2004 and 2008, Colombian soldiers killed more than 4,000 poor
young men and dressed them in guerrilla uniforms to claim monetary
bonuses and other perks for "combat kills."

Human rights activists provided key information about this practice,
which led the United States to bar specific Colombian Army individuals
and units from receiving U.S. training and assistance. In addition,
human rights groups provided information to the U.S. Congress about how
these killings violated country-specific human rights conditions on all
U.S. security assistance to Colombia. That information led Sen. Leahy to
freeze some U.S. military aid from going to Colombia's military. [The
U.S. government---along with the United Nations, Colombian human rights
activists, media, and the valiant leadership of the victims'
mothers---brought diplomatic pressure to bear on Colombia to encourage
prosecutions in civilian courts.]{.underline}

[The Leahy Law is only one instrument---and a limited one---that can be
used to promote justice and curb security force violations]{.underline}.
But many foreign military units still receive U.S. training and
assistance despite their commission of human rights crimes. [The
proactive, organized work of human rights groups in countries whose
security forces receive substantial U.S. aid, ideally working in concert
with U.S.-based organizations, is essential to realize the law's
potential.]{.underline}

#### Strengthening the Leahy Law solves human rights violations and strengthens the militaries capabilities and training programs

Subcommittee On Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights and

[A Common Sense Formula for Security Cooperation Consistent With U.S.
Values]{.underline}

[The Leahy Laws]{.underline} are common sense laws that [prohibit
the]{.underline} United States Government from [arming or providing
military training to security force and police units abroad who have
been credibly alleged to have committed gross human rights
violations.]{.underline} [These laws]{.underline} (there is one for
State Department assistance and one for Department of Defense
assistance) [do not prohibit the United States from providing assistance
in violent, conflict-wracked countries like Nigeria and
Colombia.]{.underline} On the contrary, because they involve a unit by
unit examination, [**the Leahy Laws provide a formula for the United
States to assist foreign military forces** even in countries where some
government forces are committing gross atrocities. They are a formula
for success in such countries, not a prohibition on
engagement.]{.underline}

Four Numbers

There are four important numbers to keep in mind about the impact of the
Leahy Laws. (All these statistics have been provided by the State
Department and cover 2011-2013.) The first number is 530,000. That\'s
the approximate number of foreign military and police units which the
United States government considered arming or training over the last
three years and subjected to Leahy vetting.

The second number is 90 percent. That is the minimum percentage of
prompt approvals given under the Leahy Law - generally within 10 days of
a request. There is even a \"fast track\" approval process for countries
with generally good human rights records. Some vetting requests require
more information, investigation or discussion. But at least 90% are
approved more or less immediately.

The third number is 1 percent. In every one of the last three years
[less than 1 percent of all units vetted under the Leahy Law were
ultimately declared to be ineligible for assistance under the law. Of
course it is true that the number will be higher in some specific
countries, but taken as a whole the Leahy Law actually blocks aid in a
miniscule percentage of cases.]{.underline}

The final number is 2,516. The Leahy Law blocks aid in a tiny percentage
of cases, but that doesn\'t mean that it is unimportant. Because the
U.S. now provides training to so many people, even 1 percent is a lot.
And 2,516 is the number of vetted units that the U.S. Government found
to be credibly linked to gross atrocities over the last three years when
it took the time to examine their records because of the Leahy Law.

[Those 2,516 units were not being asked to satisfy a high
standard.]{.underline} In no way does the Leahy Law require pristine
forces. In fact, the State Department defines \"gross human rights
violations\" to include a very short list of only the most heinous
offenses: murder, torture, rape, disappearances and other gross
violations of life and liberty. That\'s it. So even though less than 1
percent of proposed units failed the standard, [it is still pretty
shocking that over the last three years the United States Government
probably would have armed and trained 2,516 units (or individuals in
those units) containing murders, rapists and torturers without the Leahy
Law.]{.underline} 

**[The Leahy Laws don\'t actually prohibit the U.S. from working with
even these units -]{.underline}** the ones that have committed murder
and torture. **[It only says that the U.S. cannot arm or train them
until the foreign government takes steps to clean up the
unit.]{.underline}**

#### Leahy Law enforcement increase military capacity while managing human rights concerns

RESEARCH SERVICE(Lauren, Testimony before the House Foreign Affairs

International Organizations "Human Rights Vetting: Nigeria and Beyond,"

Attention to Leahy laws may intensify as DoD and the State Department
determine what effect the new broader DoD Leahy provision will have on
security assistance overseas. The expanded provision is repeated in the
House version of the FY15 Defense Appropriations Act, and the Senate
Armed Services Committee has proposed to codify the provision this year.

As recent hearings have highlighted, [the United States is currently
seeking to balance security and human rights concerns in
Nigeria]{.underline}. U.S. security assistance to Nigeria has been
constrained by both law and policy concerns, and the security
relationship has been hampered at times by a lack of cooperation from
Nigerian officials and by systemic problems in the Nigerian military.

Nigerian security force abuses in the context of operations to counter
Boko Haram have complicated efforts to pursue greater cooperation
despite shared concerns about the group. [Political and human rights
concerns have been a prominent factor in shaping U.S.-Nigeria relations
for decades.]{.underline}

State Department reports have continued to highlight serious human
rights violations by the Nigerian security forces for every year since
the transition from military rule in 1999. According to the State
Department, [the information on security force abuses currently
implicates roughly half the units in the Nigerian military, and likely
would render those units ineligible for assistance if they were
submitted for vetting]{.underline}.

Despite restrictions on some units, [U.S. security assistance to Nigeria
is sizeable by regional standards, totaling almost \$20 million in
FY2012 State Department funding, and \$16 million in
FY2013.]{.underline} DoD funding for Nigeria has been limited, but
appears set to expand under a proposed New Global Security Contingency
Fund Program.

Multiple systemic factors constrain the effectiveness of the Nigerian
security force response to Boko Haram; notably, security sector
corruption and mismanagement. Some of these factors impede U.S. support,
even for units cleared for assistance. [Many soldiers, particularly
those in the northeast, reportedly suffer from low morale, and they have
struggled to keep pace with a foe that is increasingly well armed and
well trained.]{.underline}

By many accounts, Nigerian troops are not adequately resourced or
equipped to counter the insurgency, despite a security budget
approaching \$6 billion. In the assessment of DoD officials, [Nigerian
funding for the military is skimmed off the top.]{.underline}

[DoD officials have assessed the Nigerian forces as \`\`slow to adapt to
new strategies, new doctrines, and new tactics,\'\' and have described
Nigeria as \`\`an extremely challenging partner to work
with.]{.underline}\'\' U.S. officials have sought to encourage the
government to take a more comprehensive counterterrorism approach, and
one that is, in the words of one of DoD official to Congress, less
brutal. [One of the primary aims of DoD engagement is to \`\`convince
the Nigerians to change their tactics, techniques, and procedures in the
northeast.\'\']{.underline}

The State Department suggests that [the Leahy laws have provided a
strategic tool to encourage reforms in Nigeria, and in Africa more
broadly]{.underline}. The [Nigerian military has sought to develop its
own civilian protection and human rights monitoring and training in the
past year]{.underline}, and the [Nigerian President recently ordered
more human rights training for officers]{.underline}.

Nigerian officials have also made statements suggesting an evolving
counterterrorism strategy, one that seeks not only security but also
political and economic solutions. In sum, Nigeria provides an example of
the challenges U.S. policymakers face in building foreign
counterterrorism capacities.

By many accounts, developing countries like Nigeria that are struggling
with terrorist threats may desperately need the specialized skills and
support that U.S. security assistance is designed to provide. [But when
security forces abuse civilians, U.S. engagement may risk not only
tainting the U.S. image]{.underline}, but also may fuel popular
grievances and alienate local populations.

U.S. officials continue to explore ways to improve the vetting process
in the dialogue with partner governments to enhance effectiveness in
accountability and to mitigate the risk that U.S. partners might not use
U.S. assistance responsibly.

Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.

### Must End to At Least Full Unit

#### Ending aid to the full unit is the only way to hold accountability for atrocities

**Rickard, 14**---Washington director of the Open Society
Foundation(Stephen, Testimony before the House Foreign Affairs
Subcommittee On Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights and
International Organizations "Human Rights Vetting: Nigeria and Beyond,"
7-10-14 ProQuest)// gcd

Just a Few Bad Apples: Critics sometimes argue that it is wrong to hold
whole units accountable for the acts of just a few, or perhaps even just
one, member of the unit. They argue that we should vet specific
individuals rather than units and only withhold information from those
individuals who are linked to atrocities.

Here it is important to understand that the Leahy Law was a compromise.
There was and is an important human rights law - Section 502B of the
Foreign Assistance Act - which does not permit the United States to
engage in a unit by unit assessment of foreign partner forces: \"No
security assistance may be provided to any country the government of
which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of
internationally recognized human rights.\" **[There is a very strong
argument to be made under Section 502B that the United States should be
providing no assistance whatsoever to Nigerian forces, and many others
around the world.]{.underline}**

But historically [the United States has been extremely reluctant to
invoke Section 502B even in the most extreme cases]{.underline}. So the
[Leahy Law was proposed as an intermediate step: If the U.S. will not
completely cut off governments engaging in a consistent pattern of gross
human rights violations, then at least it should not arm the specific
military units it believes are the ones actually committing the gross
violations]{.underline}. However, Senator Leahy also believed that it
would be absurd and unreasonable to ask that human rights victims be
able to identify the specific murder, torturer or rapist by name before
the U.S. took any action. So, **[his law states that if credible
information can be presented that links an identifiable unit to a
specific atrocity the United States would be required to cut off that
unit - at least until the foreign government identifies the specific
individuals within it who are responsible and deals with
them.]{.underline}**

### Leahy Allows for Restoration of Arms Sales

#### Leahy law allows for restoration of assistance once violators have been held accountable

**Mahanty, 17** \-\-- director of the U.S. program at the Center for
Civilians in Conflict, previously spent 16 years at the U.S. Department
of State where he created and led the Office of Security and Human
Rights in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (6/27/17,
Daniel R., "The "Leahy Law" Prohibiting US Assistance to Human Rights

[With almost weekly news reports of US support for foreign governments
with track records of gross human rights abuse]{.underline}---think
torture in Yemen by Emirati security forces, violations by Iraqi forces
in Mosul, or extrajudicial killings by police in the Philippines---[it
is worth focusing attention on the statute intended to bar some of this
assistance]{.underline}. [In]{.underline} the fall of
20[13]{.underline}, [I assumed the role of overseeing implementation of
the so-called Leahy Law, and the accompanying process commonly referred
to as "Leahy vetting" for the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and
Labor]{.underline} (DRL). [The Leahy Law is the colloquial term for a
provision of the Foreign Assistance Act (section 620M) and its twin
provision in the National Defense Authorization Act.]{.underline} There
are some important differences between the State and DOD laws, but for
the sake of simplicity, I will deal primarily with the Department of
State's law or the features that are common to both.

[The Leahy Law is intended to prevent US-funded assistance from reaching
specific security force units or individuals who have committed gross
violations of human rights.]{.underline} Less commonly acknowledged,
**[the law is also intended to promote accountability for violations
through its "remediation" clause which allows the restoration of
eligibility for US assistance once violators have been held to
account]{.underline}**. Anybody who has touched the Leahy Law has an
opinion about it, but it's hard to find anybody fully satisfied by the
way it is interpreted or implemented. Human rights advocates tend to
love the law but believe it is not applied comprehensively or rigorously
enough.\[1\] Many people inside State and DOD privately tend to resent
the law as a noxious irritant at best or a dangerous threat to US
national security at worst. (The Leahy Law may be unrivaled in its
ability to generate hyperbole.)

### Improving Implementation Solves

#### Improving [implementation]{.underline} will make Leahy Law more effective

**Leahy, 18** \-\-- Senator D-Vt. (6/22/18, Patrick, "Reader Mail:
Senator Patrick Leahy Responds to Brandon Weichert,"
<https://spectator.org/reader-mail-senator-patrick-leahy-responds-to-brandon-weichert-2/>,

[Any law is only as effective as its implementation.]{.underline} [Since

**[S]{.underline}**tate [and]{.underline} **[D]{.underline}**epartment
**[o]{.underline}**f **[D]{.underline}**efense [have made great strides
in institutionalizing the Leahy laws. But more can be done.]{.underline}
[We need to ensure that the laws are understood by our partners and by
our own officials, and **implemented proactively and effectively**;
improve the quality of the information used for vetting units of foreign
security forces; and encourage and facilitate accountability for abuses,
including so we can resume assistance to previously suspended units in
partner countries to achieve our common objectives.]{.underline}

Our interests are not served by misrepresenting what the Leahy laws do
or creating a false dichotomy between human rights and national
security, nor does history support such a distinction. [Far from
impeding our ability to advance U.S. interests, the Leahy laws have

#### Stronger Leahy Law indicates US commitment to human rights

Organizations ("Human Rights Watch Testimony at House Foreign Affairs

Recommendations

[In the nearly 20 years since the Leahy Law became law and as the
administration places greater emphasis on building the capacity of
foreign security forces, it is entirely appropriate for the
administration and Congress to explore how to make improvements so the
law can be more effective.]{.underline} Specifically, we are concerned
that [human rights vetting remains deeply underfunded, that many within
the US government, as well as other governments, don't understand the
law or its implications, and that the executive branch hasn't provided
sufficient policy guidance on steps other governments can take to
address problems of abuse within their security forces.]{.underline}

To that end, Human Rights Watch would like to recommend a few steps
forward.

[First, Congress should appropriate sufficient funds to support the
Leahy vetting process. Currently, the US government vets approximately
\$15 billion of US security assistance (between State Department and
Defense Department funded aid) annually]{.underline}. The FY15 House
Foreign Operations Appropriations includes \$2.75 million appropriated
in support of the Leahy Law while the Senate version increases the
amount to \$5 million. [Human Rights Watch urges you to support the
Senate amount, as increased funds are crucial to support staffing and
computer infrastructure in Washington. **In key embassies around the
globe** -- where vetting begins -- **these funds will help expedite and
strengthen the process.**]{.underline}

[Second, **Congress should press the administration to develop clear
policy guidance** on how diplomats and military officials can support
foreign governments **to promote accountability for abuses committed by
foreign security forces**. The Leahy Law requires the administration to
offer assistance in remediation, but this area of the law and associated
policy are woefully underdeveloped.]{.underline} In some countries, such
as Colombia and Bangladesh, there have been efforts to support an
attempt to clean up the abusive units unable to receive funds, but this
approach is all too rare. [The **US government should build out this
central tenet of the Leahy Law by** capitalizing on the wide-ranging
in-house expertise on developing and **supporting judicial mechanisms
for accountability and the rule of law.**]{.underline}

[Finally, **the administration should publicly embrace the principles of
the Leahy** Law by clearly and transparently communicating its
requirements and consequences to all partner nations]{.underline}. As a
law reaching beyond US borders, US ambassadors and their staff need to
understand the law's implications, explain it to foreign governments,
and clarify what assistance could be available if they reform abusive
units. [This will entail publicly articulating which units are barred
from receiving US security assistance, why, and precisely what reform
efforts a government must undertake to reverse the ban**. Doing this
would make a positive and lasting contribution to accountability and the
rule of law by showing US commitment to upholding** and improving
respect for **international human rights,** and expecting its partners
to do the same.]{.underline}

### Leahy =\> Effective Missions

#### Leahy Law is critical to build [effective mission success]{.underline}

**Malinowski, 16** -- Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human
Rights, and Labor U.S. Department of State (Ted "U.S. SECURITY
ASSISTANCE AND HUMAN RIGHTS", The Brookings Institution, 12-12-19,

kel\$

So, that is some of what we have done. Looking forward, and I'm doing a
lot of looking backward and forward in my last 40 some days as Assistant
Secretary in this job, one thought that I have had in looking at these
issues is that [our security assistance efforts around the world can
serve two distinct purposes, which are both legitimate, but sometimes
find themselves in conflict.]{.underline}

[In some cases, we are deliberately aiding a foreign security force to
actually do something, to achieve a particular security objective,
helping to fight an insurgency, for example. Helping to protect its
border or defeat a terrorist group.]{.underline}

[In other cases, security assistance is provided more with the aim of
solidifying relationships with a partner/government.]{.underline} Now,
[you might think that we pay less attention to human rights in the first
of those two situations where we are helping partner forces that are
engaged in conflict.]{.underline} In fact, for all the reasons I
mentioned, [the opposite is the case.]{.underline}

[We have an even greater stake in holding foreign security forces
accountable and in providing equipment and training that is actually
suited for the task when we are working with partner forces that are
actually trying to do something, because **we want them to be
operationally effective**.]{.underline}

**[Human rights requirements are]{.underline}** not just the right thing
to do in those situations, they are actually **[one of our insurance
policies to ensure effectiveness]{.underline}**.

I have noticed, and you guys who have followed the debates around the
Leahy law know, there has at times been friction with some in the
Defense Department who perhaps understandably see the Leahy law as an
obstacle to doing some of the things they want to do. What really
surprised and heartened me when I took this job is that [in the places
where our military is actually engaged in helping a foreign security
partner fight a war, the Leahy law actually tends to be more popular
than in places where the primary orientation of our security assistance
missions is building relationships]{.underline}, because [**the
warfighters know human rights abuses kill the mission, they want the
mission to succeed**.]{.underline} [The Leahy law gives
them]{.underline} a tool, a very [fine tool, to achieve our
goals]{.underline}.

In fact, I think [particularly looking at the Middle East, you will see
that we have been gradually shifting the way we provide security
assistance to a number of partners as the aim of our security
relationship with them shifts somewhat from the relationship building
mold to achieve a security objective mold.]{.underline}

### Cause of Action 🡪 Enforcement / AT: CP Executive 

#### Broad executive power caused the initial failures in enforcement only serving to preserve the U.S.' image---internal controls don't prevent funding and get circumvented -- congress is key

**Miller, 12** - J.D. from Cornell Law (Fall 2012, Nathanial Tenorio
Miller, Cornell International Law Journal, "NOTE: The Leahy Law:
Congressional Failure, Executive Overreach, and the Consequences," 45
Cornell Int\'l L.J. 667, Lexis-Nexis Scholastic)//hecht

In June of 2011, at around eleven o\'clock at night,
[police]{.underline} in Kandahar City, [Afghanistan arrested two
twenty-three-year-old men]{.underline}. n1 Referred to as Najib and
Ahmad, they worked at a restaurant and were [accused of feeding the
Taliban]{.underline}. n2 [They were taken to police headquarters
and]{.underline} transferred to the custody of men wearing the uniform
of the Afghan Border Police (ABP). n3 [The policemen tied a scarf to
Najib\'s handcuffs and hung him from the ceiling]{.underline}. n4 [The
officers then began to **beat him with a metal baton and a length of
cable.**]{.underline} n5 After the beating, [the police threw Ahmad and
Najib into the back of an armored Humvee, where they **spent the night**
in handcuffs. n6]{.underline}

\[\*668\] [The next morning, the officers]{.underline} brought the two
young men to the governor\'s palace, which the United States military
and the ABP jointly guarded. n7 Near the back of the palace was a room
containing only a gas-powered generator. n8 The police [forced Najib to
lie on his back as they attached wires to his toes.]{.underline} n9 The
police then asked Najib to \"tell \[them\] the truth\" and then switched
on the generator. n10 [After Najib **passed out from the pain, the
police repeated the process** with Ahmad.]{.underline} n11

Later that evening, [the officers brought Najib and Ahmad to see the
commander of the Border Police]{.underline}, Abdul Raziq. n12 [Najib and
Ahmad explained]{.underline} to Raziq that [they had merely been sending
spare food from their restaurant home with young boys]{.underline} so
that [the boys **could feed their families**]{.underline}. Raziq then
ordered Najib and Ahmad released. n13

[What happened to Najib and Ahmad was **not an isolated
incident**]{.underline}, perpetrated by individual soldiers or
commanders. n14 Instead, it is a symptom of the wider failure of the
Afghan government to address human rights abuses within their armed
forces. Three months after Najib and Ahmad\'s arrest, Human Rights Watch
released a report documenting killings, rapes, arbitrary detentions,
abductions, forcible land grabs, and illegal raids by irregular armed
groups and the Afghan Local Police (ALP). n15

[This]{.underline} incident also [demonstrates the consequences of the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates\' **[circumventing its own
laws]{.underline}** [to permit]{.underline} the [distribution of
military aid and equipment to]{.underline} [countries that
violate]{.underline} their citizens\' [human rights]{.underline}. In
many instances, units receiving aid from the United States are
responsible for extra-judicial killings, torture, extortion, and rape.
n16 [The failure of legislation to prevent military aid from flowing
to]{.underline} foreign military [units responsible for atrocities stems
in part from a long]{.underline}-[standing pattern in which]{.underline}
increasingly [**broad Executive power** pushes back against legislative
attempts to limit Presidential authority]{.underline} in foreign policy
decision-making. n17 Often, [Congress legislates a foreign policy
position]{.underline} [and the **Executive works around the intent,** if
not always **the letter, of the law**]{.underline}. Because of
subsequent congressional inaction, and a series of Supreme Court
decisions effectively depriving any potential party of means to sue for
enforcement of human rights legislation, the Executive remains in firm
control. n18 [Without any independent check on its
authority,]{.underline} [the **Executive\'s internal**]{.underline}
\[\*669\] [**controls are** **insufficient to prevent funding** units
that have committed human rights abuses.]{.underline}

This [**Executive control has very real consequences** for people around
the globe]{.underline}. For Fiscal Year (FY) 2012, the
[Obama]{.underline} Administration [requested \$ 12.8 billion for
military aid to Afghanistan]{.underline}. n19 In addition to
Afghanistan, in 2012 [the United States plans to supply \$ 3 billion
in]{.underline} Foreign Military Financing ([FMF) to]{.underline} the
government of [Israel]{.underline}, n20 \$ [1.3 billion to
Egypt]{.underline}, n21 \$ [350 million to Pakistan, n22 \$ 44 million
to Colombia, n23 \$ 20 million to Indonesia, n24 and \$ 15 million to
the Philippines]{.underline}. n25 [All of these governments are accused
of **widespread human rights violations**]{.underline}. n26 While it is
certainly not true that all beneficiaries of U.S. military aid commit
human rights violations, that [distinction is likely lost on the
civilians who suffer the consequences]{.underline}.

In 1997, Senator Patrick Leahy introduced two laws, known as [the
\"Leahy Law\"]{.underline} or the \"Leahy Amendment,\" (the law), which
he **[envisioned as \"an essential tool for protecting human
rights]{.underline}**.\" n27 The Leahy Law places conditions on the
dissemination of U.S. military aid to countries accused of human rights
violations. n28 Though the U.S. Department of State has used the law to
prevent some aid from being distributed to units in Colombia, Indonesia,
and Pakistan, n29 this Note will show that [the law\'s construction and
inherent difficulties in policing military sales have rendered it
almost]{.underline} **[completely ineffective]{.underline}** [in
preventing the human rights violations]{.underline} it \[\*670\] was
introduced to combat. Instead, [the law succeeds in **only partly
distancing the United States**]{.underline} [from]{.underline} its
[allies\' human rights abuses.]{.underline}

This Note accepts as part of its premise that the goals of the Leahy
Law - protecting people from human rights violations or, at the very
least, disassociating the United States from those human rights
violations elsewhere in the world - are valid. To illustrate how the
Leahy Law fails to achieve its goal, this Note outlines the procedure
and mechanisms for U.S. foreign military aid and the Leahy Law\'s
enforcement mechanisms. Next, it details Afghanistan, the Philippines,
and Colombia as examples of regimes whose militaries routinely commit
human rights abuses as documented by the State Department and
international non-governmental organizations (NGOs). It then outlines
four factors that prevent the Leahy Law from succeeding in preventing
human rights violations: the statutory distinction between the two laws;
the narrow definition of \"unit\"; the difficulty in tracking aid; and
the fact that arms, and to a lesser extent training, are fungible
commodities. This Note places the failure to enforce the Leahy Law into
a constitutional framework and on a continuum with other examples of
Executive power pushing back against congressional regulation of foreign
policy, a pushback described in a 1988 article by Harold Koh. n30 This
Note concludes by suggesting that [because judicial oversight and
enforcement are unlikely]{.underline}, in order to be effective [the law
must be re-written to make **larger segments of foreign militaries
ineligible** for funding or]{.underline} to [**categorically deny
funding** to countries whose militaries have been accused of human
rights violations]{.underline}.

V. CONCLUSION

Leahy has significantly outperformed its predecessor, § 2304, in
withholding U.S. security assistance to human rights abusers. However,
[the State Department has failed to fully enforce Leahy. Enforcement
gaps have allowed foreign security forces accused of gross violations of
human rights access to U.S. security assistance, including the Colombian
brigade responsible for the San José de Apartadó massacre.]{.underline}

Amendments aimed at perfecting Leahy have provided measureable
improvements in enforcement and aggressive congressional oversight has
provided a corrective for enforcement gaps. [However, amendments to
Leahy's procedures cannot eliminate all risk of enforcement gaps and
adhoc congressional oversight is not an effective solution. For victims
of abusive security forces and taxpayers concerned with seeing lethal
U.S. security assistance in the hands of abusive militaries, the stakes
are simply too high to rely exclusively on the State Department for
Leahy enforcement.]{.underline}

By incorporating a private cause of action to enforce Leahy to the
remedies already available to human rights victims under the TVPA,
Congress could empower victims and democratize Leahy oversight. Imagine
the outcome if the victims of the San José de Apartadó massacre had been
able to file suit in a U.S. court to enjoin U.S. security assistance to
the Seventeenth Brigade. [The power of a private cause of action in the
hands of the victims may have spared the U.S. government the
embarrassment of funding a Colombian army unit that brutally massacred
eight civilians, including three children. More importantly, it could
have pressured the Colombian government to more swiftly bring the
perpetrators to justice. The amendment proposed herein would have opened
the doors of federal courts to human rights victims to assist the
government in barring U.S. security assistance to foreign forces
responsible for gross human rights violations.]{.underline}

[\<Broadening Leahy enforcement beyond the narrow confines of the State

process, would provide a correction for some of these enforcement
problems.]{.underline}124 [**A private cause of action** to enjoin the

of weak Leahy enforcement while empowering human rights
victims**]{.underline}.12 Absent a private cause of action, Leahy has

Leahy vetting decisions to pressure the State Department to robustly
enforce existing Leahy Law mechanisms. 126

IV\. CONTRIBUTION

[Leahy's purpose, the ad-hoc nature of congressional oversight, and the
lack of available judicial review requires congressional action to
remedy the statutory deficiencies described in this]{.underline} Note[.
A private cause of action would eliminate the judicial barriers to Leahy
enforcement in federal courts and democratize Leahy enforcement by
allowing victims to enjoin further security assistance to the
perpetrators who committed the violations until effective steps are
taken to punish them]{.underline}.163 Such a cause of action should be
enacted as part of the TVPA because it would complement and enhance the
remedy provided by the TVPA to the victims of human rights abuses. [The
cause of action would also further the goals of Leahy by providing a
backstop to ensure that no security assistance is provided to human
rights abusers even when the State Department declines to enforce Leahy
due to a conflict of interest with the national security or foreign
policy priorities.]{.underline}164 Congress should enact a private cause
of action to enforce Leahy as an amendment to the TVPA to underscore
that the measure is a complement to the remedies currently available to
human rights victims under U.S. law.

[This Note proposes a simple, yet powerful, amendment to the TVPA to
create a private cause of action to enjoin the State Department to
enforce Leahy that would significantly enhance the statute's
effectiveness.]{.underline} This amendment complements the existing
private cause of action already available under the TVPA while adding a
powerful tool for human rights victims to further the goals of Leahy:
barring U.S. security assistance to human rights abusers and promoting
accountability for human rights abuses. First, Part IV.A proposes an
amendment to the TVPA to incorporate a private cause of action to
enforce Leahy.165 Next, Part IV.B provides commentary on the proposed
amendment and addresses possible counterarguments.166

#### Only Private cause of action can make Leahy enforceable

Judicial Enforcement of Leahy

[An analysis of relevant case law indicates that, **absent congressional
action to create a private cause of action for enforcement, judicial
enforcement of human rights** conditions on foreign military assistance
**is improbable.**]{.underline} 145 A Central District of California
case and other analogous cases demonstrate that the political question
doctrine and a potential plaintiffs lack of standing render Leahy
judicially unenforceable at this time, suggesting the need for a
statutory remedy.14 6

[Absent congressional action specifically authorizing a private cause of
action to enforce Leahy, the political question doctrine would stymie
any Leahy challenge.]{.underline} 147 [**Courts are exceedingly
deferential to the executive branch regarding issues of** national
security, **foreign policy, and military affairs**, all of which are
implicated by Leahy.]{.underline} 148 [In Abusharar v. Hagel, the
**court declared that Leahy enforcement was** a \"quintessential
political question\" and held that \"the decision to provide military
support to a foreign nation\" is **not subject to the jurisdiction of
the court**.]{.underline}1 4 9 The predictable result in Abusharar would
be the outcome in any judicial action to enforce Leahy; absent
congressional action to expressly authorize judicial action, Leahy
enforcement in U.S. courts is foreclosed by the political question
doctrine. 150

[Without a congressionally authorized private cause of action, any suit
by a plaintiff seeking judicial enforcement of Leahy would be dismissed
due to a lack of standing.]{.underline}5 1 [**For a plaintiff to have
standing to sue for enforcement of Leahy,** she would bear the burden of
demonstrating that she has a \"personal stake\" in an existing
controversy.]{.underline}1 52 A Leahy plaintiff must show that she \"has
suffered an injury in fact that is caused by the conduct complained of
and that will be redressed by a favorable decision\"; however, [today a
court would find that a Leahy claim is simply a general harm that could
be better redressed by a coordinate branch of government]{.underline}153
[A Leahy claimant cannot show that the threat of future harm is
\"sufficiently real and immediate to show an existing controversy\"
because the risk of repetition is extraordinarily remote]{.underline}.M
Of particular importance for a Leahy claimant, the Supreme Court has
held that \"past exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a
present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief .. . if
unaccompanied by any continuing, present adverse effects.\"15 5 [A
compelling Leahy plaintiff may persuasively allege past harm, but
**demonstrating a real and immediate threat of future harm due** to a
failure to enforce Leahy **would be exceedingly
difficult**.]{.underline}1 s

Abusharar, the only attempt at judicial enforcement of Leahy,
demonstrates what would likely be the result of any other judicial
enforcement efforts; virtually any conceivable Leahy plaintiff would
lack standing before the court to challenge the statute.15 7 Due to the
inherent difficulty with establishing standing in a Leahy enforcement
action, it is unsurprising that the court found Abusharar lacked
standing in his case.1 5s In Abusharar, the only case on point, the
plaintiff attempted to establish standing by alleging an injury caused
by the continued provision of United States-supplied weapons to the
Israeli defense force despite credible allegations of gross violations
of human rights. 159 However, the court dismissed Abusharar\'s suit for
an injunction against military aid to Israel, simply stating that he
failed to demonstrate injury in fact, causation, and redressability. 1m
[Establishing standing presents a nearly **insurmountable obstacle to
obtaining judicial relief under Leahy without a clear indication from
Congress authorizing private actions to enforce Leahy**.]{.underline}161
[However, just as with the political question doctrine, **congressional
action to create a private cause of action to enforce Leahy in U.S.
courts would eliminate the standing problem for potential
claimants.**]{.underline}162

### AT: Leahy Fails -- Top Level

#### The Leahy Laws [aren't perfect]{.underline} but they would [incentivize countries]{.underline} to [resolve abuses]{.underline} and are a powerful tool to ensure that arms don't get to military units committing human rights violations 

**Striffolino & Smith, 13** \-\-- \*Advocate & Science for Human Rights
Project Coordinator for Amnesty International\'s Crisis Prevention &
Response Unit, AND \*\*AIUSA Military, Security and Police (MSP)
Coordination group (Kathryn R. Striffolino and Nate Smith, 7/9/13,
"Deconstructing the Leahy Law: Fact vs Fiction,"
<https://www.amnestyusa.org/deconstructing-the-leahy-law-fact-vs-fiction/>,
accessed on 5/26/19, JMP)

There are some misconceptions currently floating around about the U.S.
government's Leahy Law and we want to set the record straight on a few
things. [**The Leahy Law is a powerful yet often-overlooked tool to help
prevent the U.S. government from directly arming human rights
violators** in the ranks of foreign security forces and to help the U.S.
avoid complicity in the commission of human rights
violations.]{.underline}

So how can you distill fact from fiction? Allow us to deconstruct some
of the facts, fictions and misconceptions about the Leahy Law. And
expect more in the coming weeks about this important law, and other
instruments available to the U.S. and global community to prevent arming
human rights perpetrators.

What is the Leahy Law? The Leahy Law (also known as the Leahy Amendment)
prohibits most types of U.S. foreign aid and Defense Department training
programs from going to foreign security, military and police units
credibly alleged to have committed human rights violations. If the
foreign government brings the responsible members of the unit to
justice, U.S. foreign aid can be resumed. The Leahy Law is named after
Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), a Congressional human rights champion and
the chief sponsor of the law.

Fact: [The Leahy Law is law, not a policy guideline.]{.underline} It
originated in 1996 from efforts to control U.S. military aid to Colombia
during the period in time when Plan Colombia was materializing and
Amnesty International and many other organizations had been documenting
egregious violations committed by the Colombian military and police.
**[It is different from other human rights legislation because it does
not require a decision to cut off aid to an entire country -- which the
U.S. government is often reluctant to do -- rather it tackles the
challenge by prohibiting aid solely from the offending
units.]{.underline}**

Fiction: The Leahy Law solves the human rights problems of foreign
military and police units. Interestingly, [the Leahy Law places the
burden on both the U.S. government and human rights organizations to
document and compile information regarding alleged abuses]{.underline}
-- but the law and associated vetting process is not perfect, nor will
it alone solve the human rights problems of foreign security units.

Take for example, the vetting process itself. The U.S. government
currently utilizes Google key word searches as a first step in its
online investigation (and for those who aren't familiar with this type
of search, it does not pick up information in PDFs -- so a tip for
fellow human rights organizations: make sure your reports are also
available in HTML/text). Additional staff dedicated solely to the
vetting process have, however, recently been added to the State
Department's payroll -- indicating that this process may be
strengthening.

The Leahy Law is by no means a silver bullet- take for example the gap
in oversight of arms sales which the recently adopted (and. we hope,
soon to be signed and ratified by the U.S.) Arms Trade Treaty promises
to fill. The Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) requires that arms exporters
conduct an assessment of the risk that the arms could be used in
committing human rights violations, and to take measures to mitigate
that risk or halt the transfer if the risk reaches a certain level.

Even this type of historic, multilateral agreement cannot stop all human
rights abuses, though. While the government's obligation to respect,
protect and fulfill human rights requires a comprehensive approach,
measures such as enacting the Leahy Law and ratifying the ATT are
critical, and as such require political will and the determination of
the people to hold the government to account.

Misconception: Changes in the law two years ago aimed at strengthening
its enforcement have complicated U.S. military leaders' ability to train
and equip foreign security forces. **[The recent revisions to the law
strengthen the ability of the U.S. government to ensure that the U.S. is
not complicit in arming perpetrators of human rights violations and
further encourages accountability.]{.underline}**

[Often, identifying individual perpetrators amongst the ranks is
difficult in repressive or insecure environs -- victims and their
families, facing opaque judicial systems, can be intimidated into
silence. This is why the U.S. government now bans entire units from
receiving foreign assistance.]{.underline}

So [while the changes in the law add additional safeguards which may be
perceived by military officials as unnecessary barriers in their ability
to expeditiously train foreign forces, **the safeguards further ensure
the U.S. is not arming perpetrators**. Military leaders should therefore
embrace, not criticize the recent amendments, as ultimately, they help
to ensure the U.S. is not complicit in the commission of future abuses
by training foreign combatant with a poor human rights
record.]{.underline}

Fact: The Leahy Law has had an impact. **[The Leahy Law has saved lives
since its passage and it provides an incentive to countries whose
security forces' possess poor human rights records to clean up their
act.]{.underline}** **[U.S. policymakers should be looking for ways to
make this law]{.underline}** and others like it **[stronger, and in
doing so, strengthen the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates'
**[security and standing abroad]{.underline}**.

The truth is, **[there is no human rights panacea -- it's an ongoing
struggle, waged by those who believe in basic rights protections for
everyone. The Leahy Law is one critical tool in that struggle. Its
effectiveness is measured in human rights violations prevented -- for
those to outweigh the U.S. military's professed inconveniences, the
voices of those who fight for human right must be heard.]{.underline}**

### AT: Cause of Action Hurts Presidential Powers

#### Judicial implementation of the Leahy Law is key to enforcement and doesn't undermine presidential powers

B. Commentary

[Leahy's most significant shortcoming, uneven enforcement, could be
remedied through a simple, yet powerful, statutory cure: a private cause
of action to enforce Leahy]{.underline}. Leahy has prevented security
assistance from reaching abusive units of the security forces and
spurred accountability for human rights abuses in Indonesia, Honduras,
Guatemala, Colombia, Bangladesh, and Nigeria.168 [However, in some of
these same countries, Leahy was unable to bar security assistance to
units of the security forces allegedly responsible for gross violations
of human rights.1]{.underline}69 Leahy is a relatively new statute, and
Congress has recognized the need to perfect it and has been willing to
do so.170 [Expanding the power to enforce Leahy beyond the State
Department could serve to pressure the State Department toward more
effective enforcement while also ensuring egregious enforcement failures
can be remedied through the courts.]{.underline}

[Critics may argue that subjecting the executive branch's foreign
security assistance decisions to judicial review violates constitutional
separations of powers and ties the hands of policymakers attempting to
deal with national security threats.]{.underline} [However, providing
victims of human rights abuses the opportunity to challenge a State
Department determination in federal court is a procedural, rather than
substantive, change. **Enhanced Leahy enforcement via judicial review
would implicate national security no more than properly vigorous State
Department enforcement**]{.underline}. Thus, any criticism that Leahy's
enforcement could undermine policymakers' ability to address national
security must be addressed in the statutory scheme itself, rather than
by attacking the enforcement mechanics. Thus far, such arguments have
been unpersuasive to Congress.171 [Moreover, **creating a private cause
of action to enjoin the State Department to enforce Leahy would provide
for more uniform enforcement of Leahy without radically changing
Congress's approach to human rights enforcement or subjecting foreign
affairs determinations to judicial scrutiny.**]{.underline}

[First, Congress has already recognized the importance of a judicial
remedy for the victims of human rights abuses committed
abroad]{.underline}.172 The TVPA created a private cause of action for
damages in U.S. courts for the victims of torture and extrajudicial
killings committed abroad against foreign individuals.173 The human
rights abuses subject to claims under the TVPA, torture and
extrajudicial killings, already closely mirror the violations subject to
Leahy scrutiny.174 Allowing a U.S. court that can award damages to a
victim under TVPA to consider a suit to enjoin further security
assistance to the security forces responsible for the violations if that
assistance violated Leahy would provide a more complete remedy for the
victim.

[Second, a private action to enforce Leahy would not represent an undue
interference in foreign affairs in violation of the political question
doctrine. The Supreme Court has clarified that congressional
authorization of judicial review of military and national security
affairs eliminates the barriers generally erected to protect these areas
of executive branch authority]{.underline}.175 Therefore, if Congress
creates a private cause of action to enforce Leahy, the political
question doctrine should not present an obstacle, as Congress has
authorized the court's consideration of the question.176

### AT: New Units Will Be Created

#### No risk of new units being created in response -- too much pride, administrative costs and disorganization

**Smith and Aubrey 14**- Christoper Smith is the Chariman of the
Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and
International Organizations and congressman from New Jersey and Peter
Aubrey is retired Colonel and President of Strategic Opportunities
International(Testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee On
Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights and International
Organizations "Human Rights Vetting: Nigeria and Beyond," 7-10-14
ProQuest)// gcd

Mr. Smith. Let me just ask the question with regards to units versus
individuals and just get each of, if you would, your thoughts on that.
You make the point, Colonel, that sometimes the taint is forever. And I
was talking to Elisa Massimino before we reconvened, and it just struck
me that there are a number of units in the U.S. military, including the
unit that Lieutenant William Calley was a part of, the Abu Ghraib
deployment, where the bad apples were prosecuted. Not enough, obviously,
with Lieutenant Calley; he is the only one who was convicted as a result
of the My Lai massacre in Vietnam.

And it just seems to me that maybe reconstituting or encouraging host
governments like\--or friendly governments like Nigeria to come up with
a brand-new unit, as opposed to an old unit that has a terrible
reputation.

And as you point out, Ms. Blanchard, you know, there is a tension there,
and you do quote Admiral William McRaven in Congressional testimony that
while he supported the vetting process, it has restricted us to the
number of countries and our ability to train units that we think need to
be trained. Individuals\--that is an absolute, that individuals should
be vetted to the greatest extent possible.

But it does become at least problematic about the unit side. Your
thoughts on that, because it seems to me that it is worth a discussion,
and I am sure there will be a little difference of opinion as a panel.

Colonel Aubrey[. And I will bring myself back to my\--what had been my
profession for most of my adult life, is we are quite proud of those
little pieces of cloth, the streamers that hang from our regimental
colors, and so forth. Asking someone to rebadge doesn\'t usually sit
very well with a soldier. They are quite proud of their unit
lineage]{.underline}.

If you look at the battle streamers on the Army colors, they date back
to Valley Forge. [So approaching any other country\'s units to discuss,
you know, reconstitution doesn\'t necessarily sit well]{.underline}.
Whether or not we agree with their lineage, [a lot of times they are
quite proud of their lineage]{.underline}. That on these units
they\--you know, because of their colonial past, they talk about the
colonial wars they fought, or what they did in the First World War, the
Second World War, and are quite proud, and rightfully so, of their
lineage.

I [think what is even more important is that for the Leahy vetters,
whether it is in the Embassy or with INVEST, is that they understand the
order of battle, and understand what the units really mean]{.underline}.
What is the difference between a section or a platoon, a division, a
battalion? Who ranks what, the sergeant or the general? [And that would
be effectively\--to understand what the unit rotation is, what is the
turn of enlistment to the unit?]{.underline}

Liberia, which had a turn of enlistment, they just\--the first batch
of\--they have just brought in their second batch of recruits since the
LAF was reconstituted. So if you know that they are going to do a
rotation in 6 years, that if a unit had done something 10 years ago, the
chances of anybody being in that unit, having committed that atrocity,
is gone.

That would be much more effective than saying take the 131 that
committed atrocities in Maiduguri 3 years ago, and we are going to
rebatch it as the 151, because we won\'t know.

Mr. Smith. Thank you.

Ms. Massimino?

Ms. Massimino. Yes. So the examples that you gave of U.S. units, where
there were abuses, you know, those are examples where there was
investigation, prosecution, and I think in order to get the full value
of the Leahy laws and human rights vetting, as I said in my testimony,
you don\'t want that viewed in sort of a narrow way where you just kind
of rearrange the deck chairs and see if you can assemble.

I mean, that is one way, and it is perfectly permissible under the law
to create new units and all that. [But, really, what we want, what we
all want, fundamentally, the Leahy law is to prompt better human rights
performance, stronger commitment on the part of the militaries and the
governments to accountability and the rule of]{.underline} law. And you
don\'t get that if you are, you know, just rearranging the deck chairs.

But, you know, as to [these units that, you know, have this sense of
identity and cohesion and all of that, there is nothing inherently wrong
with that]{.underline}. But we all know that there are units that are,
you know, proud and have cohesion around the wrong things. They are
notorious for being human rights violators.

And I think there you really have to wonder whether long term the
interests are going to be served if you are balancing those interests
with keeping that band of brothers together when what has drawn them
together and the identity of the unit is not something you want to
perpetuate.

Mr. Smith. Yes.

Ms. Margon. Just quickly, [I think if you are talking about rogue
elements or abusive units within an otherwise law abiding military in
the country, then the units should be disbanded and prosecuted, the
individuals should be prosecuted.]{.underline} This is in fact what we
have recommended in specific cases in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and
[Afghanistan. But if it goes beyond the rogue elements or the abusive
units and is a more endemic problem within the security forces, then
nothing else is going to suffice, as]{.underline} Elisa said, when
it\--as opposed to accountability or prosecution.

And there the U.S[. can plan a really important role. The State
Department, USAID, Defense Department, and Justice all have really deep
and varied experience in helping set up justice mechanisms, technical
expertise]{.underline}. Prosecution is a critical component that helps
with the institutional reform, so it really depends on what you are
looking at when it comes to the unit.

### AT: Vetting Weak

#### Leahy Law vetting has improved \-\-- helps other nations develop effective counterinsurgency programs 

**Malinowski, 16** -- Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human
Rights, and Labor U.S. Department of State (Ted "U.S. SECURITY
ASSISTANCE AND HUMAN RIGHTS", The Brookings Institution, 12-12-19,
<https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161212_security_human_rights_transcript.pdf)//>
kel\$

One way in which we did it, and this gets back to where you started, is
the Leahy law. [The]{.underline} great thing about the [Leahy
law]{.underline} is that unlike past exercises in legislative
conditionality on U.S. assistance, it does not say if country X commits
human rights abuses, we cannot provide support to country X.

It [says if a unit of a foreign security force has committed serious
human rights abuses and not held the perpetrators accountable, then we
cannot provide assistance to that unit.]{.underline} It's a scalpel.

[It enables us as we did in Columbia to continue helping a country deal
with a very serious security threat while at the same time allowing us
to withhold assistance in a targeted way from those elements of that
country's security forces where the problem has been
concentrated.]{.underline}

Actually, Columbia is one of the first places where the U.S. Government
really took the Leahy law seriously, back in a day when yes, the law was
on the books, but we had not yet developed the systems and the tradition
of consistently applying it across the world as we do today.

[**Over the last decade, we have professionalized our Leahy vetting
process.** We have created a system where every day around the world our
embassies are vetting units, vetting individual participants in our
military training programs.]{.underline}

In fact, [we are now vetting 180,000 units and individuals every single
year]{.underline}, considering both DOD and State Department assistance.
[We have doubled down on what we call "Leahy outreach," explaining the
Leahy law and the vetting process to our partners at DOD and our
embassies worldwide.]{.underline}

Over the last year, [our little Human Rights Bureau's leadership has
visited every U.S. military combatant command]{.underline}, apart from
UCOM, and many of our embassies and consulates overseas to address and
resolve Leahy concerns as they come up.

#### Vetting procedures in Leahy Law are stringent and comprehensive

**McKinney, 16** \-\-- private security adviser with hands-on experience
in multiple conflict areas around the world (6/2/2016, Edward, "Don\'t
Bend the Law to Fight Terror in Nigeria; America shouldn't give weapons
to human-rights abusers,"
<https://nationalinterest.org/feature/dont-bend-the-law-fight-terror-nigeria-16440>,
accessed on 6/22/19, JMP)

Earlier this month, the Obama administration revealed that it is poised
to sell up to twelve light attack aircraft to Nigeria in a bid to
support the country's fight against Boko Haram.

This might sound laudable at first glance, but in reality, selling arms
to Nigeria would mean the United States essentially breaking
[the]{.underline} so-called [Leahy Law]{.underline}. Passed in 1997 by
amending the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, it [prohibits
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [from
exporting arms to "any unit of the security forces of a foreign country
if the Secretary of State has credible information that such unit has
committed a gross violation of human rights."]{.underline}

**[The Leahy Law's three-stage vetting process is
stringent.]{.underline}** [It begins with the appropriate U.S. embassy
carrying background checks on the individuals or units applying for
assistance, by analyzing the]{.underline} Department of State
([DoS]{.underline}) [International Vetting and Security
Tracking]{.underline} (INVEST) [system, DoS Country Reports, cooperating
with local police forces or even interviewing individual victims where
necessary. If any credible information is found, the embassy can bar
further support or refer to Washington.]{.underline}

[In Washington, the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and
Labor]{.underline} (DRL) [receives the results of the ambassadorial
vetting and conducts investigations of its own. Again, if **credible
information that the violation or issue is serious enough to prohibit
U.S. involvement is found, support is refused and the findings recorded
in INVEST**.]{.underline} Lastly, [if further review of the information
is required, then DRL will assemble a broader team of State Department
representatives, who may request further information from the embassy in
the country in question before a decision is made**. With such a
meticulous evaluation process, it is puzzling that there is any
expectation that the Nigerian military will possibly pass the
test.**]{.underline}

Indeed, the Nigerian military is currently being investigated by the
International Criminal Court (ICC) on charges of illegal killings and
unlawful incarcerations. In June of last year, an Amnesty International
report claimed that, in the course of Nigeria's war against Boko Haram,
brutal conditions while in government detention have led to the death of
at least seven thousand people, while an additional 1,200 have been
"extrajudicially executed" by Nigerian security forces. A further twenty
thousand have been "arbitrarily arrested."

And the man elected to clean up the country, President Muhammadu Buhari,
seems to be either thoroughly naive or thoroughly complacent. In June of
last year, he called for a lifting of the Leahy Laws, arguing that the
"unproven allegations" of Nigerian security forces' human-rights
violations had rendered his forces impotent against the might of Boko
Haram. His statement ignored two very crucial facts. The first that, as
the later proven human-rights abuses showed, the Nigerian military was
certainly not sitting on its hands waiting for U.S. support in the fight
against Boko Haram and second, the application of the Leahy Laws, never
results in a "blanket ban" on whole countries, it is individuals or
units who are assessed before assistance is either granted or refused.

Buhari's questionable relationship with reality came to the forefront
once more in December 2015, when he declared that Boko Haram had been
"technically defeated"---a curious statement given the fact that the
group's body count rose by 62 percent in 2015, and in the first quarter
of 2016 more than thirty-six attacks that left 422 dead were staged. And
worryingly, Muslim herdsmen of the Fulani tribe also seem responsive to
the clarion call of Islamic extremism, launching systematic attacks on
the people of the largely Christian Benue state in north central
Nigeria.

Terrorism and human-rights abuses aside, the country is, in UK Prime
Minister David Cameron's words, "fantastically corrupt." And despite
Buhari's spokesman Garba Shehu retorting that Cameron "must be looking
at an old snapshot of Nigeria," the evidence suggests otherwise. In a
survey of 168 countries carried out by Transparency International in its
annual "Corruption Perception Index," Nigeria ranks thirty-second from
bottom. Sambo Dasuki, a former national security advisor in charge of
weapons procurement was arrested in 2015 and accused of "stealing more
than \$2 billion from the military" by awarding phantom contracts to buy
twelve helicopters, four fighter jets, bombs and ammunition---they were
never delivered.

In a country like Nigeria, adding weapons contracts would only fan the
flames of corruption and provide, quite literally, further ammunition to
an army that is already making a name for itself for its flagrant
disregard of human rights. [The Leahy Law is there for a very good
reason. The process of vetting individuals and countries is rigorous,
and individuals and entities are considered on a case-by-case
basis.]{.underline}

If Nigeria's military keeps failing the assessment, the solution is for
it to address the serious issues that permeate the nation, not for the
United States to bend the rules.

### AT: Not Enforceable / Definition of Human Rights

#### A clear definition of human rights already exists \-\-- just needs to be enforced

**Washington Post, 19** (6/2/19, Editorial Board, "Trump should focus
more on defending human rights than redefining them,"

[THE STATE Department has published a Federal Register notice to
establish a new commission on human rights in pursuit of "fresh thinking
about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our
nation's founding principles of natural law and natural
rights."]{.underline} Secretary of State Mike [Pompeo said he was trying
to "make sure that we have a solid definition of human rights upon which
to tell all our diplomats around the world."]{.underline}

The notice, first reported by Politico, did not say where the human
rights discussion has "departed" from the nation's founding principles.
Some rights defenders suspect that the administration intends to narrow
the definitions, perhaps excluding women's reproductive rights or LGBTQ
rights. Without knowing more, such as the commission's members or
official mandate, it is hard to say.

But what is indisputable is that **[the "solid
definition"]{.underline}** Mr. **[Pompeo seeks already
exists]{.underline}**. [It is described fully in the 43rd annual report
on human rights prepared by State's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights
and Labor, which draws on U.S. missions around the globe to examine the
state of freedom and human dignity.]{.underline} As Mr. [Pompeo
wrote]{.underline} in his preface to the report, [the "fundamental
freedoms of religion or belief, expression, peaceful assembly and
association belong to every human being. These freedoms are not granted
by governments but are derived from the inherent dignity of the human
person."]{.underline} [The foundation of international rights law is the
1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, supplemented by other norms
and agreements to which the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [has long adhered and pressed other nations to
respect]{.underline}.

President Trump and Mr. Pompeo have raised human rights abuses only
sporadically, to pressure adversaries such as Iran and Venezuela, while
ignoring gross violations elsewhere, a gaping inconsistency that
undercuts the moral leadership of the United States. Of course, human
rights are never the only concern in foreign policy and must be balanced
against other factors and interests. But it does not require any more
"solid definitions" to understand the horrors of Xinjiang province,
where China has herded more than 1 million Turkic Uighur Muslims into
brainwashing camps to eradicate their culture and language. This ethnic
cleansing has come to light during the Trump administration, but its
reaction has been tepid.

[Do the president and the secretary need any more "solid definitions" in
order to object to the methods of Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed
bin Salman]{.underline}, whose hit squad was dispatched to Istanbul to
kill journalist and Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi? Is the United
States having trouble finding a voice to speak out against the abuse of
human rights in Turkey, Egypt and Russia because of a lack of
definitions --- or because of a misplaced desire to butter up the
authoritarians who rule them?

"Fresh thinking" is always valuable. But **[when it comes to human
rights, time-tested institutions, principles and tools exist. They just
need to be utilized.]{.underline}**

### AT: DA Allies -- Weichert Link Ans

#### Weichert doesn't understand the Leahy Law \-\-- it doesn't require the U.S. target allies \-\-- only certain bad military units within the country

**Leahy, 18** \-\-- Senator D-Vt. (6/22/18, Patrick, "Reader Mail:
Senator Patrick Leahy Responds to Brandon Weichert,"

accessed on 6/22/19, JMP)

Re: Brandon J. Weichert, "Repeal the Leahy Law":

To The Editor:

In "Realism in foreign policy is undercut by utopian gestures"
(6/12/18), Brandon [Weichert]{.underline} argues that the Leahy laws
[should]{.underline} be repealed. My first suggestion is that he [read
the laws]{.underline}, which are as concise as they are clear, [because
**either he has not done so or he knowingly misstates their purpose and
effect**]{.underline}.

Mr. Weichert incorrectly states that "the provision," which is actually
two similar but not identical laws that apply, respectively, to the
Department of Defense and the Department of State, "bans the United
States government from rendering military assistance of any kind to
countries with an unsavory human rights record," and that "\[should\]
the United States fully adhere to the Leahy Law and only support
democratic regimes, it would find itself losing out in the grand,
geopolitical game."

None of that is accurate. **[Far from being the blunt instrument
described by the author, the Leahy laws neither prohibit U.S. assistance
for entire countries nor limit it to only "democratic
regimes."]{.underline}** What **[the laws]{.underline}** actually do is
**[require the Secretaries of State and Defense to suspend U.S.
assistance for an individual unit of foreign military or police forces
if they have credible information that such unit has committed a gross
violation of human rights]{.underline}**, such as murder of a civilian,
torture, or rape. However, **[assistance to the unit is suspended only
if the foreign government fails to take steps to punish those who commit
such crimes]{.underline}**.

**[In the rare instances that U.S. assistance is suspended for a unit,
assistance for the rest of the country's security force remains
unaffected.]{.underline}** Over 90 percent of all cases submitted for
vetting are approved annually. [In exceptional cases when the U.S.
withholds assistance for an entire country, it is due to a policy
decision or another provision of law, not the Leahy laws.]{.underline}

[I agree]{.underline} with Mr. Weichert [that cutting off assistance to
an entire country is rarely in our interest. But **the Leahy laws
provide a far more targeted approach**]{.underline}. When our government
is supporting the Afghan National Security Forces to reestablish control
in former Taliban strongholds, ensuring that U.S. taxpayer money is not
used to support units known to have raped children, while continuing to
support units not involved in such acts, hardly seems like "idealism,"
or a "utopian gesture." [Requiring accountability for]{.underline} such
[crimes is a pragmatic way to enhance the professionalism of our
partners, which helps build their legitimacy and ensures that the U.S.
is not associated with such acts]{.underline}.

[Whether our partners are democratic, authoritarian, or otherwise, it is
a mistake to hide behind so-called "realism" as an excuse for tolerating
U.S. support for, or acceptance of, war crimes or other heinous
offenses.]{.underline} **[Realists recognize that government repression
is a leading risk factor for radicalization in many countries, and it is
in our interest to help prevent it. Are we naïve enough to believe that
the abuses and repression of today will lead to stability tomorrow?
History has taught us otherwise.]{.underline}**

Any law is only as effective as its implementation. Since 1997, the
Department of State and Department of Defense have made great strides in
institutionalizing the Leahy laws. But more can be done. We need to
ensure that the laws are understood by our partners and by our own
officials, and implemented proactively and effectively; improve the
quality of the information used for vetting units of foreign security
forces; and encourage and facilitate accountability for abuses,
including so we can resume assistance to previously suspended units in
partner countries to achieve our common objectives.

[Our interests are not served by]{.underline} misrepresenting what the
Leahy laws do or [creating a false dichotomy between human rights and
national security, nor does history support such a
distinction]{.underline}. **[Far from impeding our ability to advance
U.S. interests, the Leahy laws have provided an effective example of how
U.S. national interests can be pursued overseas in a manner that
promotes the rule of law and is sustainable over the long
term.]{.underline}**

people per year. There is simply very little risk reduction to be gained
from any strategy. **[The idea that the United States should be willing
to accept the significant negative effects of arms sales for minimal
counterterrorism gains is seriously
misguided.]{.underline}**[49](about:blank#_idTextAnchor049)

Moreover, even if one believed that the benefits would outweigh the
potential costs, arms sales still have almost no value as a tool in the
war on terror for several reasons. First[, the bulk of arms
sales]{.underline} (and those we considered in our risk assessment)
**[involve major conventional weapons, which are ill suited to
combatting terrorism]{.underline}**. Many U.S. arms deals since 9/11
have involved major conventional weapons systems such as fighter jets,
missiles, and artillery, useful for traditional military operations, but
of little use in fighting terrorists. Insurgencies that hold territory,
like the Islamic State, are one thing, but most terrorist groups do not
advertise their location, nor do they assemble in large groups.

Second, [there is little evidence from the past 16 years that direct
military intervention is the right way to combat terrorism**. Research
reveals that military force alone "seldom ends
terrorism."**]{.underline}[50](about:blank#_idTextAnchor050) This
comports with the American experience in Afghanistan, Iraq, and
elsewhere in the war on terror to date. [Despite regime change,
thousands of air strikes, and efforts to upgrade the military
capabilities of friendly governments, the United States has not only
failed to destroy the threat of Islamist-inspired terrorism, it has also
spawned chaos, greater resentment, and a sharp increase in the level of
terrorism afflicting the nations
involved]{.underline}.[51](about:blank#_idTextAnchor051) Given the
experience of the United States since 2001, there is little reason to
expect **[that additional arms sales to countries like Saudi Arabia,
Pakistan, Qatar, or the United Arab Emirates will reduce terrorism, much
less anti-American terrorism specifically.]{.underline}**

Relatedly, [many arms deals since 9/11, made in the name of
counterterrorism, were irrelevant to U.S. goals in the global war on
terror because they provided weapons to governments fighting terrorist
groups only vaguely]{.underline} (if at all) [linked to al Qaeda or
ISIS.]{.underline} Although selling weapons to the governments of
Nigeria or Morocco or Tunisia might help them combat violent resistance
in their countries, terrorist groups in those countries have never
targeted the United States. As a result, **[such arms deals cannot be
justified by arguing that they advance the goals of the United States in
its own war on terror in any serious way.]{.underline}**

Finally, [arms sales are completely useless to combat the largest
terrorist threat to the U.S. homeland --- lone wolf attackers already
living in the United States]{.underline}. As noted, none of the
[successful attacks in the United States since 9/11 resulted from
operations directed by al Qaeda or ISIS]{.underline}. And in fact only
two foiled attempts since then --- the underwear bomber and the
printer-bomb plot --- can be ascribed to al
Qaeda.[52](about:blank#_idTextAnchor052) Instead, [in almost all cases,
persons already living in the United States, inspired by Islamist
groups, decided to carry out attacks on their own]{.underline}. Clearly,
**[arms sales to foreign nations won't help with that problem; rather,
as many analysts have suggested, amplifying conflicts abroad may well
make the problem worse.]{.underline}**

In sum, the strategic value of arms sales for the United States is very
low given today's security environment. Different circumstances would
produce a different analysis. Although [today there is little reason for
the United States to worry about the Russian threat to Europe, during
the Cold War foreign policy experts agreed that preventing the Soviet
Union from dominating the European continent was critical to American
security]{.underline}. As a result, the United States sensibly provided
NATO allies with advanced weapons[. This strategy greatly enhanced the
fighting capability of NATO, thereby bolstering deterrence and ensuring
European security.]{.underline}

Today, happily, the United States faces no such threats. For this
reason, the argument in favor of arms sales cannot rest on national
security grounds but must rest instead on "national interest" grounds,
that is, on the benefits gained from helping other nations improve their
own security, and [from maintaining conditions generally believed to be
in the national interest, such as regional stability or the prevention
of war]{.underline}. This is already a much weaker position than the
conventional wisdom acknowledges. **[Even worse for such sales'
advocates, however, is the fact that arms sales are notoriously
uncertain tools for achieving those objectives.]{.underline}**

Winding Back the Forever War

The line between the Yemen War and America's global war on terror is not
a long one. [Congress authorized the president to use military force
against the perpetrators of the September 11th attacks]{.underline}.
Since then, military action has become a reflex rather than a rarity.
[U.S. foreign policy since 2001 has been dominated by direct and
indirect intervention, ranging from outright invasion and
occupation,]{.underline} as in Iraq in 2003, to dozens of undeclared and
unmonitored actions that might not meet the legal definition of direct
military action. Trump's excesses are an expansion of, rather than a
departure from, the practices of his predecessors. **[Congress and
public opinion have tended to applaud military adventurism when they
like its results and have avoided confrontation with the executive
branch even in cases where they disapprove]{.underline}**. [Endless war
has successfully been sold as a public necessity in a campaign against
terrorism]{.underline}, even when U.S. military action makes the world,
and Americans, less safe.

There are, of course, real security threats, and counter-terrorism
deservedly is a high priority for American officials---including in
Yemen. [An effective counter-terrorism policy would move away from a
military paradigm toward a policing framework]{.underline}, in which the
military supports a policy that pursues terrorist networks much the same
way that it pursues organized crime syndicates. As the practice stands,
the forever war it has produced and perpetuates has corroded American
values and behavior. **[Malpractice abroad has bred contempt for our
democratic values and a hopelessness about the rule of law at
home]{.underline}**. [Ideological frameworks used to justify foreign
intervention and mistreatment of civilians in conflict zones have also
been invoked at home]{.underline}. Threat inflation and demagoguery have
helped fuel bigotry and xenophobia at home. Elected officials now risk
their careers if they try to openly address the tradeoff between
security and rights.

Ending the United States' part in the Yemen campaign won't suddenly
bring an end to the American forever war. But it would mark a turning
point---a **[decisive rejection of the reflex to sign onto any military
conflict with even the slightest connection to terrorism]{.underline}**.
The [United States has a great many tools at its disposal beyond weapons
sales and direct engagement in hostilities]{.underline}. We can pursue
our interests in Yemen while avoiding extremes; and American
self-interest does not require it to fully reject its traditional allies
in the Gulf nor to actively join them in their worst excesses. [A
rational assessment of that self-interest might now be
possible.]{.underline}

accessed on 5/17/19, JMP)

The [Trump]{.underline} administration [recently released its new
Conventional Arms Transfer]{.underline} (CAT) [policy designed to
increase the already well-established U.S. dominance of the global arms
market]{.underline}. Increasing arms exports is seen as an important
part of the administration's aim to strengthen America's economy and
security. [Traditionally, U.S. arms exports have been used as tools of
power and influence, giving it political leverage over
clients.]{.underline}

[Paradoxically, however, **the emphasis placed on the economic utility
of arms sales by**]{.underline} the **[Trump]{.underline}**
administration **[is increasing the bargaining power of clients, thereby
reducing U.S. political sway]{.underline}**. **[The leverage of client
states and the U.S. arms industry is leading the administration to
release advanced military capabilities earlier than it would have done
otherwise and to play down human rights considerations raised by
Congress.]{.underline}**

Ironically, additional economic and security steps being taken by the
Trump administration may be undermining some of the intended benefits of
the new CAT policy. The president's economic protectionist agenda,
including the imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum supposedly
because of national security considerations, could undermine U.S.
defense sales by driving up prices or by prompting retaliation from
affected arms clients.

Political tensions between Washington and some its allies and partners
-- especially in NATO --- may also be encouraging them to find ways to
decrease their dependence on American-made subsystems and to increase
defense industrial cooperation between them to the exclusion of the
United States. This could potentially reduce future U.S. arms and
subsystem sales to these countries and increase competition with them
for global markets.

Trump's Conventional Arms Transfer Policy

The first CAT policy was introduced by President Jimmy Carter on May 19,
1977. Its underlying principle was that arms transfers were to be
treated with a strong presumption of denial "as an exceptional foreign
policy implement" with "the burden of persuasion ... on those who favor
a particular sale, rather than those who oppose it."

To further this policy of self-imposed restraint, Carter instituted a
ceiling on the total dollar value of American arms transfers to all but
a few traditional allies. He pledged that the United States would not be
the first supplier to introduce into Third World areas "newly developed,
advanced weapons systems which could create a new or significantly
higher combat capability." In implementing this policy, Carter issued
the so-called "leprosy letter," instructing American diplomats abroad to
refrain from assisting the U.S. arms industry in its efforts to secure
foreign buyers.

In April, the Trump administration launched the fifth iteration of the
CAT policy, designed to increase the exports of U.S. arms as an integral
part of its "America First" policy agenda. The present version of the
CAT policy prioritizes arms transfers as an important tool of American
foreign policy and, in stark contrast to the vision of Carter, is
predicated on a strong assumption of approval and the active advocacy of
the U.S. government and its diplomats with foreign leaders and
governments to buy American-made arms.

The Trump administration presents its new arms policy as a response to
the ongoing strategic competition between the great powers. Its argument
is that the new CAT policy will enable Washington to preserve
international peace by strengthening the military capabilities of its
allies and partners, while reducing the need for American boots on the
ground; maintaining its influence over the policies and actions of
client states in key regions around the world; strengthening the U.S.
military by increasing interoperability with allies and partners;
supporting the defense industry; promoting new innovation; and
maintaining American jobs. The new policy also refers to the need for an
assessment of the risks that arms transfers may pose to human rights
violations, to technology transfer issues and/or U.S. nonproliferation
objectives.

The Nervous U.S. Domination of the Arms Market

The United States dominates the growing global arms market and according
to data gathered by the authoritative Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute (SIPRI), its lead is expanding. The United States
accounted for 34 percent of total arms exports between 2013 and 2017,
ranking it significantly higher than its main competitors Russia (22
percent), France (6.7 percent), Germany (5.8 percent), China (5.7
percent), and Britain (4.8 percent). In FY 2018, the value of signed
arms deals continued to increase, reaching over \$46 billion, exceeding
the \$41 billion figure of FY 2017.

Undergirding this policy is Trump's vision that economic security is
national security. The defense and aerospace industry is America's
second-largest gross exporter. The industry contributes approximately
\$1 trillion annually to the U.S. economy and employs around 2,500,000
people. On average, 30 percent of the industry's annual revenue is
through arms exports, which reduces the need for domestic investment,
reduces the cost-per-unit for the U.S. military, and enables an increase
of investments in innovation, thereby retaining America's technological
lead.

However, a number of trends combine to make Washington nervous about its
lead in global arms sales. The first is a growing effort by other
technologically innovative arms exporters to compete with the United
States for markets. Arms sales by Britain, France, Spain, China, and
Russia have reduced America's potential share of the important markets
of the Middle East (49 percent of the U.S. arms exports between 2013 and
2017) and Asia. To a certain extent, the people behind the new CAT
policy believe that the strict and rigid regulatory and procedural
frameworks that governed the arms exports processes have undermined the
U.S. competitiveness in the global arms market and the implementation of
the new policy is anticipated to increase sales.

A second trend is the deliberate policy of client states to diversify
their arms purchases. The Arab Sunni states, for example, have in the
last couple of years spent tens of billions of dollars on European or
Russian arms rather than on U.S.-made weapon systems. Even a country
like Egypt, which has received nearly \$80 billion in military and
economic aid over the past 30 years, has tapped from its reserves and
loans from Gulf states and from suppliers in order to purchase at least
\$13 billion worth of arms since 2013 from France, Russia, and Germany
rather than from the United States. The new CAT policy aims to encourage
allies and partners to buy U.S.-made arms, including by increasing
competitiveness by dropping surcharges on products and lowering the
costs of transportation.

A third trend is the growing demands of client states for more
substantial offsets and localization of production and maintenance,
including the transfer of technology. Thus, for example, under its
Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia wants to eventually subject foreign military
contracts to a 50 percent localization rule, based on a partnership
model that includes the sharing of technologies and skills. The Middle
East's growing armored vehicles market, which is expected to reach more
than \$31 billion by 2021, is an example of a growing demand for the
transfer of technical knowledge which is used to strengthen an
indigenous defense sector that has already begun to export its own
products. Some Western European countries are more forthcoming on this
issue than the United States. However, some U.S. companies have begun
forming subsidiaries abroad.

Mobilizing the Whole Arms Exports "Ecosystem"

In essence, the new CAT policy is designed to improve the "mechanics" of
the administration's arms exports system. As explained by Deputy
Director for the Regional Security and Arms Transfers Laura Cressey:

In sum, what we're trying to do in this --- in this whole-of-government
effort looking at the arms transfer process really from soup to nuts is
trying to ensure that once we have decided that a transfer of a defense
capability to a partner is in the national security interest of the
United States, that we are able to effectively compete and efficiently
deliver the equipment to our partner as quickly as possible.

This effort is promoted by active leadership advocacy, including by the
president himself, and by hands-on marketing efforts by senior officials
participating in international arms-shows and by American diplomats
around the globe.

Additionally, the administration is actively engaging with the U.S. arms
industry, including it in the interagency process of implementing the
new CAT policy. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce's new Defense and Aerospace
Export Council submitted, during the planning phase of the new CAT
policy, 30 recommendations on how to improve the arms exports decision
processes. Congress is also being engaged by the administration and
concerns being raised, especially over possible human rights violations
of client states, are being addressed at the highest levels of the
administration.

Along with the reduction of surcharge and transportation costs, a number
of additional steps are being taken in order to increase
competitiveness. These include helping allies and partners to identify
their critical needs and expediting the transfer of these capabilities.
Furthermore, help for smaller allies to finance the purchase of American
weapons through payment schemes may be offered. The administration is
also engaging with industry to develop a strategy to deal with the issue
of offset demands from clients while being able to effectively compete
for sales.

Debunking Key Assumptions

Though impressive in ambition, expectation, and design, the new CAT
policy is premised on a number of underlying assumptions that need to be
examined. First, there are those that believe that the implementation of
the new CAT policy should lead to a linear increase in annual arms
exports. As Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International
Security Andrea Thompson recently projected about the level of arms
exports for 2019, "the CAT policy will have been in place, we'll have
gained those efficiencies and feedback from industry and partners ... so
I would anticipate that would increase sales, one would think."

However, the annual worth of arms exports tends to be uneven and
dependent on what clients are seeking to buy. The sale of major and
expensive weapon systems, such as warplanes, can single-handedly boost
the worth of arms exports for any given year. The highest recorded year
of arms sales was FY 2012 totaling \$69.1 billion, but this included a
single \$29 billion deal for the sale of 84 F-15s to Saudi Arabia.
According to the figures of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, in
FY 2014 arms exports totaled \$34.2 billion, FY 2015 totaled \$47
billion, FY 2016 totaled \$33.6 billion, FY 2017 totaled \$41.9 billion,
while FY 2018 has so far totaled \$46.9 billion.

Large-scale sales of major weapon systems create capacity limits in
consecutive years. For example, the surge in the sale of advanced
fighter jets to the Gulf countries during the Obama presidency will slow
down the future sale of these high-priced items in the years to come,
affecting overall totals of annual sales. Principally, the periodic
military needs of clients are going to play a far larger role in
determining whether the United States is going to increase foreign arms
sales in the coming years than the governmental streamlining of
organizations and procedures.

Moreover, as noted above, some of Washington's major clients, such as
the Gulf states and India have a deliberate policy of diversifying their
arms imports. A streamlined U.S. approach to arms exports makes little
difference to deliberate arms diversification strategies adopted by
client countries. At its core, a policy of diversification is designed
to increase leverage on the United States, to retain freedom of action,
and to hedge against possible negative U.S. regional policies and to
push up the quality of the capabilities being offered. Therefore, easing
U.S. defense export regulations or reducing surcharge rates will not
necessarily make much difference to the choices that these countries
will make regarding the purchase of American versus non-American-made
weapon systems.

A case in point that highlights the potency of self-serving strategic
considerations on the negotiation of arms deals is Qatar. Following the
severing of diplomatic ties with Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the
United Arab Emirates in June 2017, Qatar negotiated arms deals with
multiple exporters in an attempt to overcome its regional isolation and
broaden its international support and partnerships. It signed deals with
the U.S. for 36 F-15s (\$6.2 billion) and precision-guided munitions,
with Britain for 24 Eurofighters (\$6.7 billion), with Italy for
helicopters (\$3 billion) and for warships (\$5 billion). In addition,
it has negotiated deals with its regional partner Turkey (\$700 million)
as well as with Norway (\$1.9 billion). The perception of favorable U.S.
long-term regional policies by clients around the world is far more
likely to increase arms sales than the enhanced processes incorporated
into the new CAT policy.

Additionally, arms sales figures may be affected by other administration
policy initiatives outside of CAT, such as President Donald Trump's
tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Ironically, the imposition of
these tariffs supposedly based on national security considerations could
undermine U.S. defense sales by driving up prices or from retaliation
from affected arms clients.

The administration also uses export rules to improve its commercial
competition over other exporters dependent on U.S. components. This is
pushing traditional U.S. arms production partners to become increasingly
wary of continued cooperation and potentially reducing future profits
from the sale of U.S. subsystems to allies and partners. A case in point
is the U.S. refusal to authorize the sale of parts for the sale of the
French SCALP cruise missile to Egypt. The French government is now
seeking to reduce its reliance on U.S.-made components in its weapon
systems in order to increase their exportability, potentially increasing
future competition and reducing U.S. revenues in the future.

From a European perspective, the uncertainty surrounding Trump's
commitment to NATO's mutual defense provision, as well as his rebukes
over their financial commitments to the alliance are unsettling,
especially in light of Russia's resurgent challenges in Eastern Europe.
As the French Armed Forces Minister, Florence Parly, recently said:

Can we always count, in every place and in every circumstance, on
American support?...Listen to the statements of the U.S. president, read
his tweets: The message sent is clear and without ambiguity...We have to
count on ourselves ... build a European strategic autonomy.

On the industrial front, this push for more strategic autonomy has
already prompted some European countries to increase their independence
in major weapon system projects, including the development of a
next-generation fighter jet that will compete with the F-35, and a new
tank, potentially reducing markets for the U.S. fighter.

This brings us to another set of assumptions to do with leverage:
[Presently, the global arms market, with the availability of comparable
U.S., European, Russian, and Chinese weapon systems, is a "buyers'
market."]{.underline} **[The prominence placed by]{.underline}** the
**[Trump]{.underline}** administration [**on the economic value of arms
sales reduces U.S. leverage over affluent clients**.]{.underline}
Presently, [the administration continues to certify arms exports for
Saudi Arabia's Yemen campaign in spite of opposition from Congress, out
of fear that a cutoff of support could jeopardize \$2 billion in weapon
sales to the U.S.'s Gulf allies]{.underline}.

The United States is not alone in feeling the might of the "buyers'
market." After nixing a planned delivery of 400 laser-guided bombs to
Saudi Arabia because of it's Yemen campaign, Spain reversed its decision
once more. Canceling the delivery might have jeopardized a Saudi order
of five Spanish corvettes worth \$2 billion, with thousands of jobs at
stake. In addition, Germany has approved the delivery of weapon systems
to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in spite of a coalition
deal between Germany's ruling parties not to sell weapons to any of the
sides involved in the fighting in Yemen.

[The desire to increase revenues from arms exports in the present
"buyers' market" is leading]{.underline} the [Trump]{.underline}
administration [to consider the release of previously denied advanced
capabilities for export]{.underline}. A prime example is the
administrations push to redefine the categorization of unmanned aerial
aircrafts to increase America's share of the global market, that is
expected to grow in worth from about \$6 billion in 2015 to \$12 billion
in 2025. Easing previous restrictions, the administration has also
recently given permission to market armed drones to India as well as to
certain countries in Europe and the Asia-Pacific. The Trump
administration is also reported to be considering the sale of the F-35
to the Gulf states even though this has been a denied capability given
America's commitment to Israel's qualitative military edge.

All told, [in the booming "buyers' arms market" **the presumption of
approval policy** is likely to increase the diffusion of progressively
more advanced U.S. military technologies and capabilities around the
globe. **Given the circumstances of reverse leverage, the influence of
the U.S. over the use of the arms it exports is unlikely to be
substantial.**]{.underline} The United States has truly made an about
face from the policy of Jimmy Carter.

accessed on 4/30/19, JMP)

The Case for a New Approach

So far we have argued that arms sales lack a compelling strategic
justification, amplify risks, and generate a host of unintended negative
consequences. These factors alone argue for significantly curtailing the
arms trade. But the case for doing so is made even stronger by the fact
that [greatly reducing arms sales would]{.underline} also
[produce]{.underline} two significant benefits for the United States
that cannot otherwise be enjoyed.

The first benefit from reducing arms sales would be **[greater
diplomatic flexibility and leverage]{.underline}**. [Critics might argue
that even if arms sales are an imperfect tool, forgoing arms sales will
eliminate a potential source of leverage.]{.underline} We argue that,
**[on the contrary, the diplomatic gains from forgoing arms sales will
outweigh the potential leverage or other benefits from arms
sales]{.underline}**. Most importantly, [by refraining from arming
nations engaged in conflict, the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [will have the diplomatic flexibility to engage
with all parties as an honest broker]{.underline}. The inherent
difficulty of negotiating while arming one side is obvious today with
respect to North and South Korea. After decades of U.S. support for
South Korea, North Korea clearly does not trust the United States.
Similarly, U.S. attempts to help negotiate a peace deal between the
Israelis and Palestinians have long been complicated by American support
for Israel. [To stop arming one side of a contentious relationship is
not to suggest that the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [does not have a preferred outcome]{.underline}
in such cases. Rather, **[by staying out of the military domain
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[can more readily encourage dialogue and diplomacy]{.underline}**.

Forgoing arms sales is likely to be a superior strategy even in cases
where the United States has an entrenched interest. In the case of
Taiwan, for example, though it is clear that Taiwan needs to purchase
weapons from other countries to provide for its defense, those weapons
do not have to be made in the United States. Having Taiwan buy from
other suppliers would help defuse U.S.-China tensions. Even if Taiwan's
defenses remained robust, China would clearly prefer a situation in
which American arms no longer signal an implicit promise to fight on
Taiwan's behalf. This could also promote more productive U.S.-China
diplomacy in general, as well as greater stability in the Pacific
region. Most important, breaking off arms sales would also reduce the
likelihood of the United States becoming entangled in a future conflict
between Taiwan and China.

The second major benefit of **[reducing arms sales]{.underline}** is
that it **[would imbue the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[with greater moral authority]{.underline}**.
Today, [as the leading arms-dealing nation in the world,
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[lacks credibility in discussions of arms control and
nonproliferation]{.underline}, especially in light of its military
interventionism since 2001. [By showing the world that it is ready to
choose diplomacy over the arms trade, the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [would provide a huge
boost to international efforts to curtail proliferation]{.underline} and
its negative consequences. This is important because the United States
has pursued and will continue to pursue a wide range of arms control and
nonproliferation objectives. The United States is a signatory of
treaties dealing with weapons of mass destruction, missile technology,
land mines, and cluster munitions, not to mention the flow of
conventional weapons of all kinds. **[The effectiveness
of]{.underline}** these **[treaties, and the ability to create more
effective and enduring arms control and nonproliferation
frameworks]{.underline}**, however, **[depends on how the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates behaves.

This is not to say that unilateral American action will put an end to
the problems of the global arms trade. States would still seek to ensure
their security and survival through deterrence and military strength.
Other weapons suppliers would, in the short run, certainly race to meet
the demand. But [history shows that global nonproliferation treaties and
weapons bans typically **require great-power support**]{.underline}. In
1969, for example, Richard [Nixon decided to shutter the American
offensive-biological-weapons program and seek an international
ban]{.underline} on such weapons. [By 1972 the]{.underline}
**[B]{.underline}**iological **[W]{.underline}**eapons
**[C]{.underline}**onvention [passed and has since been signed by 178

### AT: CP International Actor -- Can't Solve Human Rights

#### U.S. policy is key -- other actors can't effectively encourage human rights protection

**Margon, 18** \-\-- Washington Director at Human Rights Watch (2/13/18,
Sarah, "Giving Up the High Ground - America's Retreat on Human Rights,"
<https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/02/13/giving-high-ground-americas-retreat-human-rights>,
accessed on 5/9/19, JMP)

[Given the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates' [historically spotty record on promoting human
rights, there are those who think that other governments can pick up the
slack]{.underline}. But **[in reality, the loss of the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[as a champion,
however inconsistent its support can be, is likely to further encourage
governments to treat their citizens poorly, confident that no meaningful
rebuke will follow]{.underline}**. **[It is]{.underline}** also
**[likely to create a leadership vacuum, and the countries that aim to
fill it---such as China, Iran, Russia, and Venezuela---will no doubt
seek to spread their no-strings-attached approach to global
affairs.]{.underline}**

So what is to be done? Realistically, the next few years are likely to
be hard on human rights. But despite the absence of U.S. leadership,
there have been some bright spots, with rights-minded countries stepping
up. At the UN Human Rights Council, for example, the Netherlands managed
to overcome opposition from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and
the United States to launch an independent investigation into the
Saudi-led campaign in Yemen. Similarly, Iceland took the lead in
drafting and collecting support from 38 other countries for a joint
statement at the council condemning Duterte's bloody "war on drugs." As
long as Trump is in power, such ad hoc coalitions of like-minded
countries will need to become the norm.

There is also much that other parts of the U.S. government can do to
protect human rights. Just as some cities and states have decided to
comply with the Paris climate agreement despite the federal government's
withdrawal, they can also find ways to protect immigrants caught up in
the Trump administration's dragnet and keep families and communities
intact.

Congress, for its part, has already resisted a number of presidential
initiatives in the interest of human rights. In May, a bipartisan group
of 15 senators sent Trump a letter urging him to "ensure that America
remains a leader in advocating for democracy and human rights."
Congressional committees are using aid allocations and authorization
bills to push back against the executive branch. Individual members of
Congress are drafting legislation, holding hearings, and meeting with
foreign officials to stand up for human rights in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Russia, and elsewhere. In December, the
Treasury Department, under pressure from Congress, imposed sanctions on
13 individuals---from Belgium, China, the Dominican Republic, Gambia,
Guatemala, Israel, Myanmar, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Russia, Serbia, Sudan,
and Uzbekistan---for corruption and human rights abuses.

But these efforts can only go so far. **[Petition gathering by
like-minded countries is less effective without the most powerful
country on earth.]{.underline}** [State and local governments can only
do so much to work around the federal government. And although Congress
controls the power of the purse, it has far less influence on foreign
policy than the executive branch.]{.underline} And all the while, the
White House's attacks on immigrants, health care, minority communities,
and the justice system will continue to diminish American credibility on
human rights overseas. Simply put, [unless it changes course
dramatically]{.underline}, the [Trump]{.underline} administration---and
the president himself---[will remain one of the greatest threats to
human rights in decades]{.underline}.

### AT: CP Exclude "X" Country -- Leahy Specific

#### [Exceptions]{.underline} like the counterplan [wrecks credibility]{.underline} of the law -- it's also racist 

**Al-Ghazali, 15** (7/28/15, Muhammad \*\*\*author not included in
proquest - was found by googling phrase from article, AllAfrica.com,
"The Hypocrisy of America\'s Leahy Law," proquest, JMP)

In the desperate quest to get Israel to accent to UN-brokered Nuclear
deal with Iran, [America has offered to even increase its military aid
to Israel]{.underline} by an additional 1.5 billion dollars per year on
top of the three billion dollars it already receives annually to
purchase US military hardware such as fighter jets and missile defence
systems.

The sales will occur i[n spite of the well-documented]{.underline}
chronology genocide and grievous [human rights abuses perpetrated by
Israel spanning several decades]{.underline}. Not only has the UN
severally sought to condemn Israel for its actions, the Americans have
become notorious for vetoing and precluding any such possibilities.

Only recently, it will be recalled, an international inquiry into
Israel\'s conduct in Gaza was launched after the UN\'s Human Rights
Commissioner concluded that there was a \"strong possibility\" that the
country was guilty of war crimes. The 46-member Human Rights Council
backed the Palestine-drafted resolution to begin the investigation by 29
votes. It was backed by fellow Muslim countries joined by China, Russia,
Latin American and African countries except Nigeria under Goodluck
Jonathan which abstained! America predictably voted against it, while
most European nations like Britain abstained.

[The same America]{.underline}, we must not forget, [has continued to
arm Egypt despite its serial repressions of bloggers and free press,
along with its crackdown on credible opposition parties like the Islamic
Brotherhood overthrown in a military coup which the US failed to
decisively condemn]{.underline}. Only last month, the US announced that
it had released 575 million dollars in military aid cosmetically frozen
since the ousting of Present Mohamed Morsi - the democratically elected
Egyptian President overthrown by the incumbent Abdul Fattah Al-Sisi
Washington prefers to do business with.

While I welcome the thaw in the relations between Nigerian and the U.S.,
which suffered during the tenure of President Jonathan; what I cannot
tolerate is the collective insult on the intelligence of Nigerians by
the attempt to flaunt the Leahy law in our faces as a measure of
American decency, or higher moral values, because it is far from
reality.

[Stripped of all pretences, **the Leahy Law has been discriminatorily
applied by Washington in furtherance of America\'s own narrow national
interests**.]{.underline} If we stretch the matter even further, i[t is
even possible to perceive a tinge of **racism in its selective
application**]{.underline}. **[A law]{.underline}** - any law for that
matter- **[assumes credibility when it is universally applied without
exception. If it fails to meet that litmus test, then it becomes the
very instrument of oppression the Leahy law wants the world to believe
it is against.]{.underline}** Our situation should serve as a poignant
lesson to our leaders. No other country can love us more than we love
ourselves.

6.3 Leahy and the Role of Human Rights in Foreign Policy

This paradox of relative motivation highlights a broader foreign policy
question about the role of human rights in foreign policy objectives.
**[Each Leahy sanctioned country will point to another regional or
international example, accusing the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[of double
standards]{.underline}**. [All countries point to Israel and Egypt, the
largest and the second largest recipients of U.S. military assistance,
as examples of countries who commit human rights violations with minimal
repercussions or justice.]{.underline} Indonesia believes that they are
vetted more closely than the Philippines. Colombia points to Bolivia and
Mexico, and it questions why those countries do not have semi-annual
certifications for their aid. [Nepal and Sri Lanka question why they
have Leahy sanctions, when Pakistan until November 2010 did not have any
restricted units and still receives military assistance that is not
directly tied to human rights performance.]{.underline}

America is Like No Other Arms Exporter and Should Act Like It

[The United States]{.underline} --- by dint of its huge military budget,
massive defense R&D, and long dominance of the global arms market ---
[can use arms transfers in ways beyond the dreams of its
competitors]{.underline}. Indeed, [many competitors recognize this,
albeit grudgingly]{.underline}. [I have interviewed officials in
multiple countries (both clients and competitors of the United States)
claiming **they will defer to U.S. wishes on arms exports if they trust
it is done for political rather than economic reasons**]{.underline}.
Many of **[America's closest allies, who are also arms export
competitors, look to the United States for leadership on controversial
importers such as Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**. And, the Trump
administration should be given due credit for exercising discretion,
given, for instance, its recent unilateral embargo on arms transfer to
South Sudan. In fact, one administration official stated flatly that
sales "will not come at the expense of human rights." In no small part,
**[U.S. domination of the global arms trade is based on the world's
belief that the United States uses its clout to advance its political
ends, not economic gain. Destroying this reputation will
do]{.underline}** little to bring jobs to the United States, while doing

### \-\-- XT: Leahy Specific

#### Can't solve -- the PIC ensures Leahy laws are applied inconsistently, destroying US credibility

**Comer 10** -- Chief of Foreign Military Sales at U.S. Department of

Don\'t)", 4-1-10, JSTOR database, accessed 6-25-19)// kel\$

The current laws designed to deny military training to foreign human
rights violators, known collectively as [the Leahy Laws, leave much to
be desired **in its application**]{.underline}. [The inconsistency in
applying these laws damages U.S. bilateral relationships with many
valuable allies]{.underline} in counterterrorism. This is particularly
True of [Indonesia]{.underline}, where [the capricious application of
unwritten human rights policy]{.underline} precludes a constructive
military relationship with a strategically placed nation, and
**[reinforces widely held views]{.underline}** by many foreign nations
**[that the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[routinely practices a double standard in its
views and practice of support for human rights]{.underline}**. Although
the State Department is responsible for administering this program,
[there are ongoing legal battles and deep divisions within the
department as to interpretations of the law that frequently result in
mixed or evolving guidance on its application, even when it is
enforced]{.underline}. [This situation has State split]{.underline}
between, on one side, East Asian pragmatists and their allies in the
Office of the Secretary of Defense, who recognize the need to move ahead
and, on the other side, the legal and human rights bureaus that
vehemently believe that relations with Indonesia cannot move forward
without an accounting of past human rights abuses. Powerful human rights
lobbies and congress members and their staffers who harbor deeply held
beliefs regarding Indonesia\'s past misdeeds complicate the situation
further. Currently, there is no resolution in sight -- Only increasing
likelihood that this issue will continue to fester into the immediate
future, further inhibiting a full military relationship between the
United States and Indonesia, greatly reducing U.S. access and influence
in the region.

The Stakes [U.S. credibility is on the line.]{.underline} [Although it
is clearly not in the best interests of the United States to train the
next Manual Noriega, neither is it in U.S. interests to unilaterally
eliminate friendly or at least cooperative nations from joining
militarily in counterterrorism efforts.]{.underline} From an absolutist
viewpoint, the options are a choice between U.S. values: [either defend
the United States or defend human rights]{.underline}, one of the
strongest principles of the United States. On the surface, and certainly
in the minds of many U.S. agencies and policymakers on the opposite side
of the question, these objectives appear mutually exclusive. But in the
Indonesian context, the reality beyond the values is more complex and
raises the question of when the past is really the past in terms of
prior human rights abuses. When is a unit \"clean?\" When no one in it
was posted to it when violations took place? When no one in the entire
chain of command was anywhere in the armed forces when violations took
place?

[This policy dilemma is being played out on the world stage to an
attentive audience. Most countries in Southeast Asia are closely
following this debate out of self-interest.]{.underline} For those parts
of the foreign governments that favor military cooperation with the
United States (normally a silent group) and understand the importance of
U.S. security assistance to their own nations\' welfare, this internal
U.S. argument has a direct impact on the quantity and quality of that
assistance. For other elements that are distrustful of U.S. motives and
actions around the world (usually a noisy element), this argument
provides proof, no matter the outcome, that the United States is really
a malicious force in the world that lives a double standard. This
sentiment fits neatly with widely held views of the United States among
Indonesian nationalists and other groups with pro-Islamic agendas.

#### **The CP highlights inconsistency \-\-- maintains paternalism**

**Opeyemi, 15** - Nigerian law student based in Lagos, writes for
TheHill and Foreign Policy Journal (Stanley, 'Nigeria calls for a
re-think of the Leahy law', TheHill, 2/5/15,

But how widespread is the use of the Leahy law? In 2011, [out of 200,000
cases that were subject to]{.underline} the [Leahy]{.underline} vetting
mechanism, **[less than 1 percent]{.underline}** of candidates, or 1,766
individuals, [were denied assistance]{.underline}. Alongside Nigeria,
the list also includes military units from Pakistan, Indonesia, and Sri
Lanka. But [many see this argument as selective]{.underline}, pointing
to [countries such as Israel, Saudi Arabia and Egypt]{.underline}, which
[**despite numerous human rights controversies** have been constant
recipients]{.underline} U.S. military gear. [Thanks to a loophole
existing in the law]{.underline}, [the Secretary of Defense can waive
the Leahy prohibition if "such waiver is required by extraordinary
circumstances.]{.underline}" What's more, [the law doesn't apply to the
assistance provided by private contractors carrying out U.S.
operations.]{.underline}

Egypt for example, which has received a steady flow of American weapons
since 1979, has been denied four large-scale weapons systems by the
State Department, \"pending credible progress toward an inclusive,
democratically elected civilian government." In spite of the ban, the
Obama administration has continued to send millions of dollars worth of
parts and guided missiles to Cairo, before lifting part of the embargo
in December, when 10 Apache attack helicopters were delivered.
Similarly, in May 2012, the U.S. has resumed military sales to Bahrain,
after a brief lull following the Arab Spring.

[In this context, the refusal of the U.S. to help arm the Nigerian
military for its fight against Boko Haram seems arbitrary and even
paternalistic.]{.underline} By refusing to invoke the waiver within the
Leahy law on "extraordinary circumstances," Washington fails to see that
enabling Nigeria to combat one of the most heinous terrorist groups of
the 21st century, a group that has killed more than 2,000 people in
2015, is in itself a human rights concern.

While State Department provides interpretation of the relevant laws and
sets the overall HRV policy, the actual conduct of the vetting is an
individual embassy responsibility. [Potential U.S.-funded trainees from
different countries frequently have different vetting results for like
allegations]{.underline}. In Leahy\'s language, the key phrase is
\"credible evidence of a gross human rights violation.\" However, the
wording also specifies \"units\" as opposed to individuals. In
Indonesia, the embassy-vetting policy became \"prove the negative,\" or
in other words, proving the individual can never have been at a place or
time a human rights violation was committed. Part of this \"due
diligence,\" is the legacy of the 2005 GAO report. In the case of
Indonesia, in a policy newly initiated on April 1, 2008, any individual
ever assigned to a KOPASSUS unit, no matter the age of the individual or
assignment history, is ineligible for U.S.-funded training. [This new
stipulation would later prove to have a profound effect on
U.S.-Indonesian military relations.]{.underline}

[Many foreign nations]{.underline}, including Indonesia, [accuse the
United States of applying double standards on just about any aspect of a
given policy]{.underline}. More often than not, these accusations are
baseless, taken out of context, or misinterpreted. [However, our foreign
critics occasionally have a point, and]{.underline} Indonesia, [in this
instance, they clearly do]{.underline}. [The application of the Leahy
Amendment standards for the countries that receive U.S. security
assistance, to be kind, is uneven.]{.underline}

It is doubtful that the Leahy standards applied to Indonesia are applied
anywhere in the world, with the notable exceptions of Columbia and Sri
Lanka, and they place Indonesia into a category normally reserved for
Iraq or Afghanistan. [No other nation in the Pacific Rim]{.underline}
(except Sri Lanka) [must face such scrutiny]{.underline}. Moreover,
[these types of HRV standards are not applied to the two nations that
consume roughly 70 percent of all U.S. security assistance granted
worldwide -- Israel and Egypt]{.underline}.11

Host nations in Southeast Asia are aware of the effects of HRV on their
neighbors. In the case of Indonesia, units, either cohort or composite,
[receiving training must undergo full vetting to include the history of
the unit itself]{.underline}. By comparison, unit vetting in the
Philippines consists of vetting only the unit commander or most senior
individual in the case of a composite unit. [Many Asia observers believe
the Philippines, which receives much higher levels of U.S. security
assistance and with an equally spotty human rights record, do not
receive the same level of scrutiny for alleged human rights abuses than
other places in the region. This perception is shared by the vast
majority of Indonesia\'s military, who frequently remind U.S. military
assigned to Jakarta that U.S. vetting standards are higher for Indonesia
than for other countries.]{.underline} In another high-profile example
in early 2008, U.S. Operations Command invited the chiefs of all Special
Forces or chiefs of national CT forces to a worldwide conference at its
headquarters at McDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida. All nations
invited only had to vet the chief of that nation\'s principal CT
organization.12 Every nation\'s military chief invited to the conference
attended, with the exception of one. That exception was Indonesia, as
State was unable to successfully vet the Chief of the Indonesian
KOPASSUS because he was a member of his own command.13 The individual
had a personal history that would have allowed any other Indonesian
Armed Forces chief to attend, but was denied solely based on the
cumulative KOPASSUS record of past human rights abuse.

The murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi prompted many to ask how Saudi
Arabia --- a staunch U.S. ally --- could think it could get away with
such a brutal act. Others have marveled at the audacity of Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman in purportedly ordering such a hit while courting
members of the political and corporate elite around the world.

Yet we need not be surprised when [the actions of the Saudi kingdom are
straight out of the playbook of human rights abusing regimes across the
globe]{.underline}.

[Iran carried out a global assassination campaign across Europe, Asia,
the Middle East and the United States in the]{.underline}
19[80s]{.underline} [and]{.underline} 19[90s]{.underline}. While
European pressure contributed to a pause in the program for more than a
decade, there are signs that it is coming out of dormancy, most recently
with accusations of an assassination plot in Denmark against a
separatist leader from Iran's Ahwazi Arab minority. The killing of
opposition leaders abroad was directly connected to the Iranian regime's
brutal and systematic executions of thousands of dissidents at home.

Khashoggi's murder is also in line with Saudi treatment of anyone who
criticizes the regime's practices or is perceived as doing so. Saudi
Arabia executes dozens of its own citizens a year, often by beheading.

**[The way a state treats its people within its own borders is always a
matter of international concern.]{.underline}** [The conventional wisdom
in some circles is that the human rights practices of a country are its
internal affairs and that global citizens, no matter how
well-intentioned, have no standing upon which to criticize those
practices.]{.underline} While some efforts have been made to chip away
at [this thinking]{.underline}, it [continues to inform state-to-state
relations and serves as a major obstacle to those who believe that abuse
of state power can be challenged by a global social movement and
international laws]{.underline}.

Fortunately, **[support for the idea of our collective responsibility
beyond borders has ample precedent]{.underline}**. Amnesty International
was founded in the 1960s on the idea that individuals could directly
appeal to release prisoners of conscience anywhere in the world. And the
idea that the international community has the ability and the duty to
challenge abuses, no matter where they occur, formed the basis of the
establishment of International Criminal Court. It also informs the
functioning of U.N. human rights mechanisms that monitor and report on
abuses worldwide, pursuant to thematic and country-specific mandates.

Unfortunately, **[the strength of this support is often plagued by a
lack of consistency]{.underline}** and double standards from states.
**[While the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[has been quick to decry the human rights
abuses of the Iranian regime]{.underline}** in recent months, **[it has
been noticeably muted in statements on the Khashoggi murder. This
compromises the weight of America's very legitimate criticisms of
Iran.]{.underline}** In contrast, the European Union, which has been far
more vocal in its recent criticism of Saudi Arabia, is being lambasted
for remaining largely silent regarding rights abuses by Iran so as not
to negatively impact its business dealings with the Islamic republic.

Such **[political expediencies prompt other states to claim that valid
condemnations of human rights abuses are somehow
illegitimate]{.underline}** --- such as what happened recently with the
vote on a U.N. resolution dealing with a trade embargo on Cuba, in which
U.S. amendments concerning human rights were dismissed as out of place
by the E.U. and others. **[If human rights concerns were always part of
the fabric of]{.underline}** these **[debates as a matter of principle,
and if states consistently condemned the abuses of all human rights
violators -- including their allies -- the argument for exclusion would
have no merit]{.underline}**.

But **[ordinary citizens must seize the opportunity to call out
governments when they are being inconsistent and demand human rights
reforms, regardless of politics]{.underline}**. While governments may
wish to retain the old power model of top-down control, new models that
thrive on participatory, decentralized structures invite the input of an
online global community. That community, whose members include digital
natives who increasingly count a friend in another country in their
online network, sees itself as a stakeholder in global causes ranging
from bringing the Turkish government to task for the Armenian genocide
to defending free speech in Zimbabwe. That power and connection thrives
online, irrespective of state lines.

That **[external support is vital to the quest for human rights in many
countries]{.underline}**. [In our native Iran, this is important because
the government has systematically dismantled civil society for four
decades now. **Those who do manifest dissent are imprisoned, exiled or
killed.**]{.underline} [Without an outside network of committed lawyers,
advocates and activists engaging in human rights reporting, devising
technology solutions and creating digital platforms to organize on human
rights issues, operating within this closed society and pushing for
progress would be far more challenging.]{.underline}

**[Just as human rights are universal, attempts to protect those rights
should also be seen as universal.]{.underline}** Whether it's Nicaragua,
North Korea, Eritrea or beyond, **[caring about human rights and
challenging injustice beyond our borders is not interventionism, it's
the duty of all supporters of freedom and democracy]{.underline}**.

Yemen has entered its third year of war, and war crimes are being
committed at an escalating rate. For Yemen's children, facing a man-made
famine, this conflict between Houthi rebels and a coalition led by Saudi
Arabia has begun a new phase of horrors.

Despite that, President [Trump]{.underline} is planning to make Saudi
Arabia the destination of his first state visit this week. Meanwhile,
his administration already [decided to lift all human rights
restrictions on arms sales to]{.underline} my country, [Bahrain, which
is a partner in the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen]{.underline}.
**[This reckless pursuit of profit without any strings
attached]{.underline}** --- including a lucrative deal for 19 F-16
fighter jets worth \$2.8 billion --- **[will aid and abet the
destruction of Yemen, intensifying the country's humanitarian
disaster]{.underline}**.

It fills me with shame that my country, Bahrain, is bombing Yemen, with
United States support. And while the Saudi-led coalition continues its
air assault on Yemen, [Bahrain is also trying to crush civil society
back home]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} other, [domestic campaign is
aimed at people who, like me, cannot abide injustice and are willing to
speak out.]{.underline}

strength]{.underline}** and a united vision for a better future.
[Americans expect to have a government that is accountable, and that
respects and protects its people's rights. That is our great
ambition]{.underline}, also, [in the Gulf]{.underline}.

We know we risk much in calling for this. Some of my fellow activists
have been tortured, sentenced to life imprisonment, even killed. But I
believe that respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms is the way
to attain peace, stability and prosperity in any nation; I have devoted
my life to that ideal.

Criticizing war crimes and torture on Twitter, speaking to journalists
about our dire situation in Bahrain and the Gulf, and writing this
newspaper: For these actions, I now face a total of 18 years'
imprisonment. I've already spent more than 10 months in jail, mostly in
solitary confinement. One of the charges against me derives from my
taking a stand against the war in Yemen --- not only because it causes
misery and tragic loss of life, but also because it fosters violence and
terrorism across the region.

[Does]{.underline} the [Trump]{.underline} administration [know that
former Bahraini soldiers have left the country to join the Islamic
State?]{.underline} Does Washington know that Bahrain allows no Shiite
citizens in its military even though Shiites are a majority of the
population? Does the White House know that the Bahraini Army is a
sectarian force that publishes books endorsing the murder of Shiites who

It is a law so vague and sweeping that my act of criticism could now

### \-\-- XT: Consistency Key

#### [Consistency]{.underline} critical to promoting human rights 

**Lagon, 11** \-\-- adjunct senior fellow for human rights at the
Council on Foreign Relations (10/19/2011, Mark P., "Promoting Human
Rights: Is U.S. Consistency Desirable or Possible?"
<https://www.cfr.org/expert-brief/promoting-human-rights-us-consistency-desirable-or-possible>,
accessed on 6/11/19, JMP)

Given differing U.S. human rights policies for Bahrain, Egypt, Libya,
Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Yemen, was Ralph Waldo Emerson correct to say
that "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds"?

A broad-minded view is that **[more consistency in promoting human
rights would]{.underline}** in fact **[better serve U.S. credibility and
national interests]{.underline}**. [Presidencies past too often
**sacrificed human rights for other foreign policy
objectives**.]{.underline} From the Spanish-American War through the
Vietnam War, U.S. policy was often a tale of assertive intervention in
other lands for strategic interests in the name of "saving" or
"civilizing" them.

In the mid-1970s, the United States established a formal "human rights"
policy with a dedicated State Department bureau headed by Patricia
Derien under President Jimmy Carter. Carter made human rights a central
theme, suggesting the United States had an "inordinate fear of
Communism," while exposing abuses by U.S. allies (as he still does).
Among other shifts, Carter backed away from a repressive Shah of Iran in
large part due to that regime's human rights abuses.

Equally moralistic in tone, Ronald Reagan began his presidency with the
converse tilt. He appointed Jeane Kirkpatrick as ambassador to the
United Nations (UN), drawn to her critique of Carter policy in Iran and
elsewhere, titled "Dictatorships and Double Standards." She argued that
traditional autocracies were more likely to evolve and liberalize than
totalitarian regimes, which seek greater social control. This led her to
reject a policy of pressing more strongly for reform in the autocracies,
which were often U.S. Cold War allies, than in the totalitarian states.
But Reagan ultimately recognized that U.S. interests were bound up in
pushing Cold War allies to reform and democratize, from El Salvador and
Chile to South Korea, the Philippines, and Taiwan.

The presidential outlier on human rights in the late twentieth century
was George H. W. Bush. In Kiev, he cautioned Eastern Europeans against
"suicidal nationalism" in seeking independence from Moscow (dubbed the
"Chicken Kiev" speech by the late William Safire). He dispatched senior
aides to reassure and toast Beijing's leaders shortly after the
Tiananmen Square massacre. After masterfully leading a coalition to end
Iraq's occupation of Kuwait, he resisted militarily ousting Saddam
Hussein, even though Saddam had gassed his own Kurdish citizens. One
must acknowledge that the intrusive UN sanctions regime put in place
instead to constrain Saddam's power in fact caused humanitarian harm to
civilians for twelve years.

President Clinton used institutions effectively to advance human rights.
Prioritizing the enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), he accelerated European Union (EU) steps to offer Eastern
European countries membership too. That there were human rights
standards for joining NATO and the EU created a potent incentive for
those countries to improve their records. But like other U.S.
presidents, Clinton picked his fights. He flipped his position and
delinked trade and human rights with China in his first year, and
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright later observed, "We do not have
a cookie-cutter approach to policy" when asked why China and Cuba were
treated differently.

The younger President Bush had the most forward-leaning rhetoric on
human rights, culminating in his second inaugural address, where he
proclaimed "the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world." He
rejected "the soft bigotry of low expectations" regarding the people of
the Middle East allegedly not being suited to exercise full liberties.
Yet he too was inconsistent in his actions: he dismayed human rights
activists by saying the Beijing Olympics were only about sports, he
turned a blind eye to Pakistani generals' manipulation of the judicial
system, he walked back from pressuring Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak,
and his policies on detaining supposed terrorists undermined U.S.
credibility.

The question about the early Obama administration was whether it would
be more like that of George H.W. Bush (coldly realist) or Bill Clinton
(morally inclined, but picking his battles). Likely alluding foremost to
Iran, Obama declared in his January 20, 2009, inaugural address, \"To
those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing
of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history, but that we
will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.\" According
to the Obama White House, the Arab Spring events led him to shift from
this realist policy of engagement to a more morally inclined approach
like President Clinton's.

This seemingly serpentine path on human rights between and within
presidencies actually reflects much continuity and convergence.
Presidents Carter and Reagan were both moralistic in tone and each
pressed allies to reform. President Obama was no more willing or able
proactively to shutter the Guantanamo Bay detention facility than his
predecessor. All recent presidents have been tough on Myanmar's leaders
and cautious in pressuring China's.

What kind of consistency would be desirable and achievable? Four
precepts would help. First, [despite how a human rights emphasis at
times clashes with important priorities in bilateral
relationships]{.underline} (e.g., trade, counterterrorism, and military
bases), [it is important not to assume that human rights always
intrinsically contradict U.S. interests]{.underline}. For instance,
[repression of expression and real-time information may only retard
economic growth and turn regimes into pressure cookers ready to
blow]{.underline}.

Second, it [is false to suggest that the greater a country's relative
power, the less the U.S. can afford to confront its human rights
failings. **Addressing liberties in Russia and China is all the more
important due to their geopolitical weight.**]{.underline} Indeed, [if
it is too inflexible in absorbing societal demands, China's autocracy
could **face a rupture threatening global stability**]{.underline}.

Third, governments that regularly deny a large category of their
citizens equal access to justice are not only violating universal
rights, but also squandering assets. For example, the United States
could advance a quiet, sustained dialogue with India about the national
government's role in transcending cultural practices of discrimination
against broad social groups that relegate valuable human capital to
squalid lives. Persistent bonded labor of disadvantaged castes despite a
1976 ban and remedy law in India is not unlike segregation persisting in
the American South until U.S. national authorities---in another federal
system---pushed states to implement laws.

Most of all, countries that deny women and girls property and
inheritance rights, free expression, and political participation are
forsaking enormous assets for civic conciliation and economic
dynamism---which is neither in their interests nor those of the United
States.

Fourth, [the Middle East should not be seen as an exception. It is a
bigotry of low expectations to think Muslims and Arabs are incapable of
exercising universal rights.]{.underline} That said, there are those who
would use newly won tools of freedom to institutionalize repression (as
some elected Islamists might). Without covertly handpicking winners, the
United States should offer a range of actors who appear authentically
committed to pluralism and peaceful contestation help to develop their
capacity to compete for power and to govern.

So where does this leave the United States in specific cases? Take Iran.
Its pursuit of a nuclear capability; its regional influence,
particularly with respect to Iraq and Afghanistan; and its role in
global terrorism are all issues of critical importance to the United
States, but they do not call for downplaying human rights. Precisely
because Iran is such a heavyweight regional power, human rights are
important. The Iranian government's treatment of women and religious
minorities limits them as societal and economic assets. The Green
Movement and the teeming vitality of civil society show that Iranians
long for fundamental freedoms. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton
is right to have joined the United Kingdom and Canada in imposing visa
restrictions on Iranian officials implicated in rights violations.

[Bahrain is a striking case of the appearance of inconsistency by
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[compared to the ultimate U.S. embrace of dissent and change in Egypt,
Libya, Syria, and Tunisia]{.underline}. A Human Rights Watch report
documented Bahrain's "punitive and vindictive campaign of violent
repression" via arbitrary arrests, hidden detention, torture, biased
military court trials, and the sacking of protest sympathizers from
jobs. [The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [stood largely silent as Saudi Arabia supplied
forces to help Bahrain put down dissent]{.underline}.

[The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[ought to view its important naval base in Bahrain as a reason to
discourage repression, which could make that nation less
stable]{.underline}. Bahrain limits the freedom of women, foreign
workers, and political opposition. [The]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[is capable of
deftly asserting more pressure on this small power to avoid
counterproductive suppression of dissent]{.underline}** (helped by the
Saudis no less), **[without losing access to a strategic
base]{.underline}**.

While it is neither wise nor feasible to have identical policies for all
nations, [more consistency based on these precepts will better serve
U.S. and global interests]{.underline}.

### AT: CP Exclude Bahrain

#### Making exceptions for Bahrain condones human rights abuses and gives Trump an opportunity to highlight transactionalism \-\-- human rights must be a [consistent priority]{.underline}

**Rajab, 17** \-\-- president of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights and
an advisory committee member for Human Rights Watch's Middle East and
North Africa Division (5/17/2017, Nabeel, "Don't Profit From Abuses by
Bahrain,"
<https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/opinion/bahrain-human-rights-abuses-weapons.html>,
accessed on 6/11/19, JMP)

Yemen has entered its third year of war, and war crimes are being
committed at an escalating rate. For Yemen's children, facing a man-made
famine, this conflict between Houthi rebels and a coalition led by Saudi
Arabia has begun a new phase of horrors.

Despite that, President [Trump]{.underline} is planning to make Saudi
Arabia the destination of his first state visit this week. Meanwhile,
his administration already [decided to lift all human rights
restrictions on arms sales to]{.underline} my country, [Bahrain, which
is a partner in the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen]{.underline}.
**[This reckless pursuit of profit without any strings
attached]{.underline}** --- including a lucrative deal for 19 F-16
fighter jets worth \$2.8 billion --- **[will aid and abet the
destruction of Yemen, intensifying the country's humanitarian
disaster]{.underline}**.

It fills me with shame that my country, Bahrain, is bombing Yemen, with
United States support. And while the Saudi-led coalition continues its
air assault on Yemen, [Bahrain is also trying to crush civil society
back home]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} other, [domestic campaign is
aimed at people who, like me, cannot abide injustice and are willing to
speak out.]{.underline}

Even so, **[we look to our friends in]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[for
strength]{.underline}** and a united vision for a better future.
[Americans expect to have a government that is accountable, and that
respects and protects its people's rights. That is our great
ambition]{.underline}, also, [in the Gulf]{.underline}.

We know we risk much in calling for this. Some of my fellow activists
have been tortured, sentenced to life imprisonment, even killed. But I
believe that respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms is the way
to attain peace, stability and prosperity in any nation; I have devoted
my life to that ideal.

Criticizing war crimes and torture on Twitter, speaking to journalists
about our dire situation in Bahrain and the Gulf, and writing this
newspaper: For these actions, I now face a total of 18 years'
imprisonment. I've already spent more than 10 months in jail, mostly in
solitary confinement. One of the charges against me derives from my
taking a stand against the war in Yemen --- not only because it causes
misery and tragic loss of life, but also because it fosters violence and
terrorism across the region.

[Does]{.underline} the [Trump]{.underline} administration [know that
former Bahraini soldiers have left the country to join the Islamic
State?]{.underline} Does Washington know that Bahrain allows no Shiite
citizens in its military even though Shiites are a majority of the
population? Does the White House know that the Bahraini Army is a
sectarian force that publishes books endorsing the murder of Shiites who
do not "repent"?

#### Doesn't solve either advantage \-\-- condones human rights abuses and highlights Trump's transactionalism 

**HRW, 18** (5/24/18, "US: Reject Planned Arms Sales to Bahrain; Manama
Should First Tackle Serious Human Rights Abuses,"
[https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/05/24/us-reject-planned-arms-sales-bahrain#](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/05/24/us-reject-planned-arms-sales-bahrain),

(Washington, DC) -- [The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates Senate [should not approve]{.underline} two
proposed [arms sales]{.underline} totaling nearly US\$1 billion [to
Bahrain given its **government's dismal record on human rights** and
relentless persecution of dissidents]{.underline}.

[The]{.underline} proposed [arms sales]{.underline}, already approved by
the US State Department, [come amid the **continued downward spiral of
human rights** since anti-government demonstrations in 2011, and
Bahrain's continued participation in the Saudi-led Yemen conflict that
has contributed to one of the world's worst humanitarian
crises]{.underline}. In the past year, Bahrain has sharpened its
crackdown on activists, lawyers, and journalists. It has arbitrarily
revoked a record number of citizenships of nationals, carried out unfair
trials of civilians in military courts, and harassed, intimidated,
imprisoned, and prosecuted rights defenders and their family members.
This is in addition to widespread ill treatment and torture by security
forces and deadly dispersal of peaceful protests, since anti-government
protests erupted in 2011.

**["These]{.underline}** two weapons **[sales make clear
that]{.underline}** the **[Trump]{.underline}** administration
**[intends nothing short of a free pass on human rights for
Bahrain"]{.underline}** [said]{.underline} Sarah [Margon, Washington
director at Human Rights Watch]{.underline}. ["The]{.underline} US
[Senate should block all arms sales to Bahrain until, at a minimum, they
release all unjustly imprisoned human rights defenders and dissidents,
and **make clear that a key US ally should not continue in such mass
human rights abuses."**]{.underline}

On April 27, 2018, the State Department approved the sale of AH-1Z
attack helicopters, missiles, and other military equipment to the
kingdom, for an estimated cost of US\$911.4 million. **[This deal comes
on the heels of]{.underline}** President Donald **[Trump's revised
policies]{.underline}** for conventional arms transfers and drone
exports, signed on April 19, **[that place greater emphasis on US
economic interests than human rights]{.underline}**.

On May 17, the State Department approved a second weapons' deal with
Bahrain worth up to US\$45 million, which included 3,200 bomb bodies to
arm Bahrain's F-16 fighters fleet. In both cases, the Senate was
notified of the sales and, under the Arms Export Control Act, has 30
days from the notification date to oppose the deal.

There are significant human rights concerns in both Bahrain's behavior
domestically and its participation in the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen,
Human Rights Watch said. [The US should hold off on all arms sales to
Bahrain until authorities show they are serious about addressing human
rights concerns.]{.underline} That should include releasing all human
rights defenders and dissidents serving long jail terms for peaceful
expression, and holding accountable officials and security officers who
participating in or ordered the widespread torture during interrogations
since 2011.

[In an early demonstration of]{.underline} the [Trump]{.underline}
administration['s]{.underline} [policy toward human rights and arms
sales]{.underline}, in March 2017, then-Secretary of State Rex
[Tillerson lifted the human rights conditions that]{.underline} the
[Obama]{.underline} administration [had attached to a sale to Bahrain of
F-16 fighter jets]{.underline} worth US\$2.8 billion.

In June 2017, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker
announced that he would hold up all newly announced arms sales to Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) nations until the council found a path to
reunification in a dispute between Qatar and other countries. Corker
lifted that hold eight months later, in February 2018, allowing for
these two sales to Bahrain to proceed, and has said that he does not
believe that human rights conditions should be attached to weapons sales
as a matter of US policy.

[The human rights situation in Bahrain continues to deteriorate as the

On May 25, 2017, security forces apparently violently raided a sit-in in
the village of Diraz. Five demonstrators died and dozens more were
injured.

[Bahraini authorities have, since 2012, arbitrarily revoked the
citizenship of at least 728 citizens]{.underline}, including human
rights defenders, political activists, journalists, and religious
scholars, and subjected some of them to arbitrary deportations,
according to the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD), a
nongovernmental organization. The vast majority of Bahraini citizens
stripped of their citizenship are left effectively stateless and are not
given adequate opportunity to meaningfully appeal these rulings.

Authorities in 2017 shut down the country's only independent newspaper
and suspended the activities of the leading secular-left opposition
political group Wa'ad. On May 13, 2018, Bahrain's parliament approved a
law barring members of dissolved opposition groups from running in
general elections planned for the end of 2018.

The Bahraini government also reversed two of the few previously
implemented substantive recommendations of the Bahrain Independent
Commission of Inquiry (BICI), was established after the 2011
anti-government demonstrations. Authorities in January 2017 restored
arrest and investigation powers to the National Security Agency, despite
its record of torture during interrogation. And in April 2017, Bahrain's
ruler signed legislation authorizing the trial of civilians before
military courts, which contravenes international law.

rights situation," said Mohamed Zaree]{.underline} of the Cairo
Institute of Human Rights Studies, winner of the 2017 Martin Ennals
Award for Human Rights Defenders.

President Sisi recently ratified a draconian law restricting the work of
NGOs, essentially making it a crime to advocate for human rights and
development. And just this week, the government announced further
restrictions on the use of social media, and parliament passed a law
giving senior military commanders immunity from prosecution for the
killing of protestors in 2013. It's widely assumed that Sisi will soon
change the constitution to abolish term limits for the presidency.

[Civil society leaders told me they want the United States to keep the
holds on the aid and to expand human rights conditions. "The military
aid is the only thing the authorities here care about," said one. "It's
the best card for the Americans to play."]{.underline}

Withholding the aid was beginning to have an effect. The authorities had
agreed to order a retrial in the notorious 173 Foreign Funding Case, in
which a criminal court sentenced 43 employees of foreign NGOs to up to
five years in jail and ordered the closure of the International
Republican Institute, the National Democratic Institute, Freedom House,
the International Center for Journalists and the Konrad Adenauer
Foundation.

When the Court of Cassation announced a retrial in April this year,
civil society leaders hailed this as a welcome first step. The hearing,
however, has been postponed until Nov. 11. At the very least, the State
Department should have waited to see progress on this case before
lifting the holds.

[Secretary Pompeo now has to decide by Sept. 30 whether to release a
further \$195 million in FMF. It's hard to see how he can certify
progress on human rights]{.underline}. He should recognize that the
repression is not only inflicting suffering on Egyptians but also
weakening U.S. nation security. Ascendant in Egypt, ISIS is recruiting
in the prisons and otherwise feeding off resentment caused by government
abuses. The United States can't afford to allow Egypt to slide further
into a dictatorship.

Secretary [Pompeo should make clear that further FMF won't be released
until there is real movement on]{.underline} Case 173 and other [human
rights violations]{.underline}. If he doesn't, Congress should deny
funding until Egypt satisfies specific conditions. Sens. Marco Rubio
(R-Fla.), Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), among others, have spoken out
against the crackdown on civil society, and Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.)
is blocking \$300 million in FMF unless Egypt meets human rights
requirements, including a proper inquiry into the 2016 torture and
murder of Italian student Giulio Regeni.

https://www.lawfareblog.com/new-york-times-us-aid-egypt-and-leahy-law,
8-20-2015)//gcd

The New York Times ran an
editorial [yesterday](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/19/opinion/the-questionable-legality-of-military-aid-to-egypt.html?action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=opinion-c-col-left-region&region=opinion-c-col-left-region&WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region&_r=1) disparaging
the federal government's "feckless Egypt policy."  The editorial board
quoted favorably from a letter Senator Patrick Leahy had sent Secretary
of State John Kerry, expressing concern first that aid to Egypt is both
\"backfiring\" and unlawful to boot. (Note: Senator Leahy's letter is
not yet public; I have relied on the Times\' account of the letter\'s
contents.)  The paper gave stress to the legal issue with its headline,
\"The Questionable Legality of Military Aid to Egypt.\"

According to the Times, Senator Leahy asked Secretary Kerry if the
United States government was supplying aid to Egyptian military and law
enforcement units that committed human rights abuses.  The Senator here
referred to legislation he had sponsored in the 1990s, nowadays known
(unsurprisingly enough) as the Leahy Law.  So far as concerns funds
adminstered by the State Department (the Defense Department has its own
program and rules), the statute prohibits the United States from
providing military assistance to "any unit of the security forces of a
foreign country if the Secretary of State has credible information that
such a unit has committed a gross violation of human rights" (22 U.S.C.
§2378d).  In that regard, the Times editorial cites a State
Department [report](http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/files/live/sites/almonitor/files/documents/2015/Egypt%20Waiver%20May%202015%20FMF-IMET-FMF.pdf) to
Congress noting that [Egyptian security forces have "committed arbitrary
or otherwise unlawful killings during the dispersal of demonstrators, of
persons in custody and during military operations in the northern Sinai
Peninsula]{.underline}." Thus the newspaper sums up and agrees with the
Senator\'s legal position---that[ "continuing to enable a despotic
government by shipping over American" military equipment is "almost
certainly unlawful" (empahsis added).  ]{.underline}

So far as policy goes, [Senator Leahy also expressed concern that
Egypt's "ineffective and indiscriminate operations" have created more
militants in the Sinai Peninsula than they killed.]{.underline} 
The Times went a little further, arguing that the [Obama
administration's "continued largely unconditional support of the
Egyptian government is backfiring."]{.underline}  In that vein,
the editorial condemned [the Egyptian government's efforts to prevent
investigation of human rights abuses, which may become worse now that
Egypt has passed its new counterterrorism law.]{.underline} The
latter, [the Times says, "establishes new tools to stifle
dissent."]{.underline}  The law creates a new court to hear terrorism
offenses (which [an
earlier Lawfare piece](https://www.lawfareblog.com/egypts-counterterrorism-law-enshrining-security-expense-civil-rights) suggested
may lead to "overly-harsh sentences")
[and [creates](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/17/egyptian-president-ratifies-law-to-punish-false-reporting-of-terror-attacks) a
new penalty for "spreading 'false' reports on attacks or security
operations against militants]{.underline}."

Senator Leahy's concern that Egypt's counterterrorism strategy is
self-defeating is well-taken; and there is of course something to be
said for the Times's call to attach more human rights restrictions to
U.S. military aid to Egypt.  But is current aid "almost certainly
unlawful?\"  

[That would require a pretty specific factual showing, as Leahy
Law restrictions apply only at a "unit" level, rather than on
a "country" level:]{.underline}

No assistance shall be furnished under this chapter or the Arms Export
Control Act to any unit of the security forces of a foreign country if
the Secretary of State has credible informationthat such unit has
committed a gross violation of human rights (emphasis added).

As for what
counts, [Congress](https://books.google.com/books?id=9FkeKsyAnt8C&pg=RA5-PA58&lpg=RA5-PA58&dq=construed+as+the+smallest+operational+group+in+the+field+.+.+.+Implicated+in+the+reported+violation&source=bl&ots=CiQjhQmEUk&sig=qpmNztO4kOWJkp6Py7hbW35zOoI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMIjIXT2923xwIVSG4-Ch0dIgON#v=onepage&q=construed%20as%20the%20smallest%20operational%20group%20in%20the%20field%20.%20.%20.%20Implicated%20in%20the%20reported%20violation&f=false) and
the [State
Department](http://www.humanrights.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/leahy-vetting-law-policy-and-process.pdf) both
understand "unit" to refer to "the smallest operational group in the
field."  

Given the legal criteria in play---and without having more specific
facts in hand---[it seems pretty hard to maintain that the aid in
question \"almost certainly\" violates the Leahy Law]{.underline}.  Even
if the Secretary of State well knows that the Egyptian
government commits human rights abuses generally, he also may not know
which units are responsible for the atrocities in particular cases, so
as to ensure that aid to the units is discontinued or blocked
initially.  This is not to accuse State of willful blindness or legal
game-playing.  The [Leahy Law also requires the Secretary of State to
"establish, and periodically update, procedures to" create a list of
units receiving aid, facilitate the receipt of information from
government agencies and NGOs, and make the whole process as transparent
as possible]{.underline}. (A more expansive description of the
procedures can be
found [here](http://www.humanrights.gov/dyn/an-overview-of-the-leahy-vetting-process.html).)
 But as the Times points out[, gathering this information is hard when
Egypt prevents journalists, NGOs, and U.S. officials "from traveling to
Sinai to investigate]{.underline}" human rights abuses in the first
place.  And the editorial is spot-on in arguing that the new
counterterrorism law can only further chill reporting on such abuses.
The trouble, though, is that the absence of such needed reporting can
make for a hazier factual picture, which in turn stands to complicate
enforcement of Leahy Law restrictions. 

In the meantime, other provisions of law tend to support the provision
of aid to the Egyptian government as a whole. The FY2015 budget required
the State Department to cut off aid to Egypt if, at the national (rather
than the unit) level, [the latter failed to remedy human rights abuses
and take steps to democratize]{.underline} (Section 7041(a)(6)).  That
provision, however, came with one whopper of
an [exception](https://books.google.com/books?id=p07cBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT855&lpg=PT855&dq=up+to+$725,850,000+may+be+made+available+only+if+the+Secretary+of+State+certifies+and+reports+to+the+Committees+on+Appropriations&source=bl&ots=HKUQMTJM2X&sig=ql0p5V5BetXXJhzrAB8AbyVQ-cU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMIs-rn6uW3xwIVCXk-Ch1chAzE#v=onepage&q=up%20to%20%24725%2C850%2C000%20may%20be%20made%20available%20only%20if%20the%20Secretary%20of%20State%20certifies%20and%20reports%20to%20the%20Committees%20on%20Appropriations&f=false):
the Secretary could ignore the restrictions if he explained in a report
to Congress why "it is important to the national security interest of
the United States to provide such assistance."  [And for better or
worse, Secretary
Kerry [exercised](http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/files/live/sites/almonitor/files/documents/2015/Egypt%20Waiver%20May%202015%20FMF-IMET-FMF.pdf) that
very option in May]{.underline}. 
(Lawfare[covered](https://www.lawfareblog.com/restoration-aid-egypt) the legislation
earlier.)

\*\*\*

It is of course possible that State is not sufficiently vetting Egyptian
security units that receive military assistance from the United States.
And Senator Leahy's letter may have been an effort to increase the
pressure on State and others in the government to subject Egyptian units
to greater scrutiny; an editorial raising the alarm will undoubtedly
increase the pressure all the more, and that\'s a good thing for sure.
 [But does U.S. aid clearly violate the law? Perhaps there is a
violation, but it isn\'t an obvious one. ]{.underline}

### AT: CP Exclude Philippines 

#### Doesn't solve either advantage -- makes America culpable for domestic behavior 

**Carpenter, 16** - senior fellow for defense and foreign policy studies
at the Cato Institute. (Ted Galen, The National Interest, "It's Time to
Suspend America's Alliance with the United States", 10/1/16,
[https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-skeptics/its-time-suspend-americas-alliance-the-philippines-17896)//SD](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-skeptics/its-ti)

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has an unfortunate
history of **acquiring ugly authoritarian allies** even when America's
security interests do not justify making such moral
compromises]{.underline}. Malou Innocent and I described many of those
unfortunate relationships in our book [Perilous
Partners](http://amzn.to/2dgkK4U%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank), noting that a
majority of the security relationships did not involve situations in
which America's vital interests were imperiled.

[Washington faces another increasingly problematic relationship: its
alliance with the Philippines.]{.underline} As I've
noted [previously](http://nationalinter) on this site, Philippine
president Rodrigo [Duterte is the personification of a "**loose-cannon"
ally**.]{.underline} Among other things, [he referred to President Obama
as "a son of a bitch," and made it clear that he had no intention of
necessarily following Washington's lead on foreign policy.]{.underline}

Since I wrote that article, [his erratic behavior, both domestically and
internationally, has grown worse]{.underline}. After indicating that he
wished to conclude alliances with both Russia and China, [Duterte stated
that there will be no further military exercises with U.S.
forces]{.underline} because China objects to such exercises. Now [he has
compared himself to [Adolf
Hitler](https://www.yahoo.com/news/philippines-leader-likens-himself-hitler-),
**affirming that he was gladly slaughtering thousands of alleged drug
dealers and drug user**s]{.underline}---all without the inconvenient
obstacles of due process---**[and would like to kill
millions]{.underline}**, just like Hitler killed millions of Jews.

U.S. officials seem strangely tone-deaf to the outrages of their East
Asian ally. Even as Duterte was cozying up to China and waxing about
Hitler, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter was affirming that
Washington's alliance with the Philippines was [nothing
less](https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-philippines-military-alliance-ironclad-pentagon-chief-184556210.html) than
"[ironclad](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/09/29/us-defense-chief-calls-alliance-wit)."

That is an unwise position for several reasons. First, [it is generally
a bad idea for a great power to pass out security guarantees in a
promiscuous manner,]{.underline} since any one of them has the potential
to entangle it in a dubious military confrontation[. The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has violated that
rule]{.underline} in a spectacular fashion, [undertaking explicit,
treaty-bound security obligations to more than four dozen countries and
implicit commitments]{.underline} to many more. The "mutual" defense
treaty with Manila is actually one of the older obligations, having been
concluded when the Philippines were granted independence in the late
1940s. But the venerable nature of the treaty does not make it a wise
one.

A second reason [a great power should avoid alliances like the
relationship with Manila is that the security client's agenda can create
embarrassments or even great dangers. The Philippines have ambitious
territorial claims in the volatile S]{.underline}outh
[C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea[---along with several other
countries.]{.underline} At a minimum[, having a treaty ally in that
position creates a headache for the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates.

Finally, [a security relationship makes America]{.underline} at least
indirectly [culpable for the domestic behavior of the client regime.
Throughout the Cold War, Washington embarrassed itself]{.underline} (if
not shamed itself) by its close relationships with an assortment of
thuggish "allies." [American officials may have deluded themselves into
believing that such relationships were essential for the republic's
security, but]{.underline} in the vast majority of cases, [that simply
was not true]{.underline}. Now in the absence of the kind of existential
threat that the Soviet Union posed, [the justification for tossing basic
moral values overboard is even weaker.]{.underline}

The United States needs to take an immediate stand regarding the
Philippines. [It is **absurd** for America to be putting **its security
on the line to defend a country ruled by an individual who is showing
his unreliability on foreign policy issues** and engages in utterly
odious domestic behavior. Washington should suspend the alliance with
Manila]{.underline} indefinitely. In the 1980s, the United States
suspended its defense commitment to New Zealand through the ANZUS pact
because Wellington would not allow U.S. nuclear vessels to operate in
its waters. Duterte's actions are vastly worse than that and at least
warrant a similar response.

### AT: CP Exclude Philippines -- China NB Answers

#### CP links to the net benefit -- arms sales could send the [wrong signal]{.underline} to China 

**Jennings, 19** (Ralph, "Why the US Might Reject Selling Arms to the
Philippines", VOA News, 3/6/19,
<https://www.voanews.com/usa/why-us-might-reject-selling-arms-philippines)//SD>

Political complexity

The U.S. Arms Export Control Act governing foreign sales is what one
political consultant called for this report "a minefield of intricacies
and legalities." For that reason, scholars say, the U.S. government
sells its new, high-end arms such as aircraft largely to long-term
partners such as Australia, Singapore and Taiwan.

Those partners know the Act, can pay the billions of dollars for new
equipment and do not turn the weapons on their own people. Sales
sometimes irk China as its navy expands onto the high seas, but Chinese
leaders are used to the repeat customers.

[The anti-drug campaign may raise questions in the United States about
"human rights" issues]{.underline}, said Eduardo Araral, associate
professor at the National University of Singapore's public policy
school. Human rights groups say anti-drug police have killed thousands
of people without due process.

[China hopes the Philippines, a rival claimant to sovereignty in the sea
between them, will ease away from the United States as part of a
Sino-Philippine friendship that included China's pledge in 2016 for \$24
billion in aid and investment.]{.underline}

["If you sell one or two ships to the Philippines and the Philippines
buys it, what signal does that send to China, that the Philippines is an
un-loyal and unreliable neighbor and partner?" Araral said. "For the
Philippines, **you don't want to send the wrong signal to
China**."]{.underline}

In Southeast Asia, only Singapore has the formula down for getting
U.S.-made weaponry, said Carl Thayer, emeritus professor at the
University of New South Wales in Australia. Singapore buys American
fighters, helicopters and drones. Officials in Vietnam, he noted, have
looked into buying American-made arms but fear they might get turned
down, he said.

[American lawmakers may worry Manila would use weapons
"recklessly]{.underline}," Thayer said.

"There's no one there, leaving Singapore out, where you have a
well-established relationship that would run smoothly, and where there
is none it hits the bumps in the road,\" he said.

Sung Kim reiterated the US commitment to the treaty following reports
Beijing sunk a Philippine fishing boat. The Chinese vessel reportedly
rammed a fishing boat in Reed Bank. A total of 22 crew members on the

His comments come after the Philippines foreign secretary, Teodoro

attack.

Mr Locsin hit out at calls for support as he called the dispute "our

#### China sees actions the US takes in the SCS as uniquely threatening -- causes miscalc 

**Wang, 18** (Xiangwei, South China Morning Post, "[Growing US presence
in South China Sea threatens accident that sparks war]{.underline}",
10/8/18,
https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/opinion/article/2167175/growing-us-presence-south-china-sea-threatens-accident-sparks-war)//SD

On April 1, 2001, a United States spy plane on a regular reconnaissance
mission over the South China Sea collided with a Chinese fighter jet,
killing its pilot and leaving 24 American crew members, along with their
plane, stranded on the island of Hainan for nearly two weeks of tension.
Although Beijing and Washington managed to defuse the crisis very
quickly, the incident encapsulated [[the volatile and fragile nature of
military manoeuvring between the two great
powers]{.underline}](https://www.scmp.com/topics/china-us-relations).
Last week -- 17 years later -- there was almost a feeling of déjà vu
when [news broke out that two American and Chinese warships had come
dangerously close to colliding in the S]{.underline}outh
[C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea.

Again, [[both sides accused each other of nearly triggering an
international
crisis](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/2166565/chinese-destroyer-nearly-collided-uss-decatur-after-trying-drive).
The US side blamed the Chinese]{.underline} destroyer [for using "an
unsafe and unprofessional manoeuvre" when it tried to intercept the
American warship, which was sailing close to the reef claimed by
China.]{.underline}

[The Chinese defence ministry spokesman slammed the US for sending
warships into waters near China's islands]{.underline} and reefs in the
South China Sea, "[gravely threatening China's sovereignty and security,
severely damaging relations between the two militaries and significantly
undermining regional peace and stability".]{.underline}

[The intense face-off]{.underline} and the near miss, which came on top
of a raging American trade war against China and other bilateral
tensions, [have heightened concerns that worsening ties, particularly
between the militaries, **could lead to not only a cold war but possibly
a hot one as well.**]{.underline}

The incident came after US Secretary of Defence James Mattis cancelled a
trip to Beijing, and the [[Chinese government last month denied a port
visit to Hong
Kong]{.underline}](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/2165697/china-denies-request-hong-kong-port-call-american-warship)
by an American warship and recalled China's top navy officer from a
visit to the United States. In turn, those moves closely followed
Washington's decision to sanction the Chinese military procurement
department and its top general over their purchases of Russian fighter
jets and missile systems.

The Chinese idiom of caqiang zouhuo springs to mind. While its literal
meaning is that of a gun going off accidentally while being polished, it
has been widely used to refer to an accident that sparks a conflict.

Since US President Donald Trump came to power, Washington has
intensified naval and aerial patrols in the South China Sea, much of
which is claimed by China, in the name of "freedom of navigation
operations". It has also encouraged its allies, including Britain,
Australia, France and Japan, to do the same.

[While the US claims it does not take sides in territorial claims in the
disputed waters, its military operations there are effectively aimed at
maintaining its influence in the Asia-Pacific]{.underline} [and pushing
back China's efforts to expand its sphere of influence in the
region.]{.underline}

Furthermore, as [other claimants for the disputed waters -- including,
mainly, the countries of Southeast Asia -- are no match for China's
strength, Washington will have to stand up to Beijing]{.underline}, or
so the argument goes.

But the reality is that even as Washington has accused China of
"militarising" the South China Sea through the creation of artificial
islands and the installation of military equipment on disputed territory
in the area, China has shifted its diplomatic approach by forging closer
economic and political ties with Southeast Asian countries to offset
their concerns over the territorial disputes.

In essence, [what is taking place in the S]{.underline}outh
[C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea [is a constant power play between
the reigning power and the rising power.]{.underline}

Some Western analysts said [the near-collision between the US and
Chinese warships signalled China's increasingly aggressive posture in
the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea, just as
they said of the Chinese fighter jet's manoeuvring 17 years ago when it
came within metres of the US spy plane.

For sure, the two incidents may have inspired fears, but the truth of
the matter is that the US never stopped conducting regular surveillance
operations off the Chinese coast, most of which would surely have
encountered Chinese military interceptions.

Now, as it tries harder to test China's patience by intensifying naval
and aerial patrols in the South China Sea, it is small wonder that last
week's incident did not occur sooner.

In a way, the 17-year gap between the two incidents shows both the skill
and the restraint of the two militaries, despite their rising rivalry.

But looking ahead, [the likelihood that an accident could spark a
possible military conflict is increasing]{.underline}, particularly [at
a time when President Xi]{.underline} Jinping [has abandoned China's
long-standing foreign policy of keeping a low profile, stepped up
efforts to increase its influence in the region and taken a firmer
stance on disputed territory.]{.underline}

In June, Xi told Mattis in a Beijing meeting that China would not give
up one inch of its territory passed down by its ancestors, an unusually
blunt message.

From the Chinese military's perspective, [the US military's constant
reconnaissance and the freedom of navigation off the Chinese coast and
the waters claimed by China are not unlike someone with hostile intent
circling around its neighbourhood, which logically calls for
interceptions and even confrontations.]{.underline}

Furthermore, China's naval and air force capabilities have come a long
way since the spy plane incident 17 years ago. That incident occurred
just two years after US planes dropped precision bombs on the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade, in what is now Serbia, killing three Chinese
citizens. The US claimed the bombing was a mistake but the Chinese
believed the act was deliberate.

Now the constant question is this -- would Americans really want to go
to war with China over a bunch of rocks and sand dunes, as some Western
analysts have argued?

from its food supply, prompting the United Nations to ask whether the
Saudis' indiscriminate bombing constitutes war crimes. Despite the
carnage---and a lack of a pressing national security justification---the
United States has continued to provide arms, refuel coalition planes,
share intelligence, and assist with targeting for the Saudis. Given our
involvement to this point, it is high time for the United States to stop
enabling Saudi Arabia's campaign.

Unfortunately, [the administration's decision to dial back its support
is too little, too late]{.underline}.

Pulling back now won't absolve American involvement in Yemen while the
sales allowed under the restrictions will continue to pour gasoline on
an already raging fire. The Foreign Military Sales program oversees the
approval process for every proposed weapons sale. Despite its mission
statement to "strengthen the security of the U.S. and promote world
peace," it's hard to see how enabling the destruction of Yemen
accomplishes either of those goals.

[The ban, which targets only precision-guided munitions, doesn't call
into question much of the roughly \$112 billion of weapons sold to Saudi
Arabia already]{.underline} during the Obama administration. Nor will it
stop current U.S. operations refueling Saudi coalition planes on all
their bombing missions. It won't stop the U.S. from sharing intelligence
or from helping the Saudi coalition with targeting guidance. And
importantly, [it won't hinder arms sales to any of Saudi Arabia's
coalition partners like the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[A]{.underline}**rab **[E]{.underline}**mirates, [Qatar, or
Kuwait]{.underline}---all of which received the green light on major
arms transfers within the past two months.

The United States, in fact, recently approved the Saudi purchase of
nearly 50 CH-47E Chinook helicopters and the associated equipment for
\$3.51 billion. This sale escapes the proposed ban even though the
helicopters could be used in the campaign against Yemen. In fact, the
only sizable pending sale the ban would prevent involves 16,000 guidance
kits, not actual bombs. The guidance systems would convert "dumb" bombs
to "smart" bombs. Ironically, on the day officials announced the ban the
U.S. delivered the first shipment of F-15SAs from an existing deal to
Saudi Arabia. From now on Saudi Arabia will be using some of America's
most-advanced heavy fighters to drop dumb bombs. So in effect, all this
ban does is force the Saudis to keep bombing Yemen with weapons more
likely to hit civilians by accident.

And we can't forget arms exports to Saudi Arabia's coalition members. On
December 8, the United Arab Emirates struck a deal worth \$3.5 billion
for Apache AH-64E helicopters. That same day a deal was finalized with
Qatar for \$81 million worth of C-17 parts and \$700 million of
logistical support services and equipment. In November, Qatar received
the yes they'd been waiting for on a \$21.1 billion deal for 72 F-15QAs.
On December 13, Kuwait was granted the ability to buy 218 M1A2 tanks for
a tidy \$1.7 billion, after closing a deal for F/A-18E/Fs earlier in
November for \$10.1 billion.

Measures with more traction and real power to cramp the air campaign
against Yemen have faced stiff resistance from Congress and the White
House. Several months ago, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Sen. Chris Murphy
(D-Conn.), Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) offered
a joint resolution to block the sale of Abrams tanks to Saudi Arabia.
The Senators cited Saudi Arabia's record in Yemen as clear motivation to
block the sale. "Selling \$1.15 billion in tanks, guns, ammunition, and
more to a country with a poor human rights record embroiled in a bitter
war is a recipe for disaster and an escalation of an ongoing arms race
in the region," said Sen. Paul. The measure was defeated.

More recently Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) introduced the "Stop Arming
Terrorists Act," legislation aimed at stopping arms sales to nations
suspected of sponsoring terrorist groups. According to Gabbard's office
the bill would effectively cut off the flow of weapons to Saudi Arabia
and hinder their activities in Yemen. It seems unlikely Gabbard's bill
will fare any better than previous attempts.

In the end, [the]{.underline} Obama [administration's proposed arms sale
ban is at best a weak attempt at "virtue signaling" -- an effort to
distance the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [from an ugly war it has no real justification
for supporting]{.underline}. [At worst, **the ban obscures the fact that
the**]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[continues to fan the flames of conflict through its arms
sales]{.underline}**. **[A better approach would be for the Foreign
Military Sales program to shut off the flow of American weapons to Saudi
Arabia and its coalition partners.]{.underline}** This approach wouldn't
end the war in Yemen, or magically bring peace and stability to the
region. But **[it would ensure that the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[isn't underwriting
illegal and counterproductive conflicts]{.underline}**. And that is a
good place to start.

to deter risky activities that lead to harmful crashes, and an ex ante

avoiding roads whenever possible. People would stop reporting accidents
to insurance companies and the police, perhaps leading to an increase in
fraudulent accidents by criminals seeking side payments. As Shavell

### Alternative to LIO Worse

#### Upholding the LIO solves the impact -- the [alternative is worse]{.underline} and is [coopted]{.underline} by [populism]{.underline}

**Begue, 19 -** Chief Editor, Head of American Division -- EUTOPYA;
student and political science major at Vassar College and deputy
politics editor of the Vassar Political Review (Anya, "A Case for
Liberal International Order" 2/2, Eutopya: Worldwide Students Magazine,
<http://www.eutopya.org/a-case-for-liberal-international-order/>

"I want to look at who drew it. You know, which group drew it. I can
give you reports that are fabulous and I can give you reports that
aren't so good" (CNN). So answered the United States President when
asked about the recent, alarming IPCC reports concerning climate change.
These reports warn that the planet is only half a degree centigrade
below "the crucial \[temperature\] threshold," a threshold we will reach
by 2030, at which point our inaction will yield imminent disaster (CNN).
Preventing this calamity would "require widespread changes in energy,
industry, buildings, transportation and cities," says the report,
calling for governments "around the world to take 'rapid, far-reaching,
and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society'" (CNN). The reality
of today's day and age is that climate change, arguably the world's most
pressing threat, can only be solved by multinational cooperation, and by
this alone. This isn't only true of [[global
warming]{.underline}]{.mark}; in an ever-globalizing world, numerous
[[other issues]{.underline}]{.mark} have arisen that [[transcend
national borders and necessitate worldwide]{.underline}]{.mark}, unified
[[action]{.underline}]{.mark}, including global terrorism, human
trafficking, and the propriety and further exploration of space. And
yet, notwithstanding this undeniable need for global collaboration, the
world is now witnessing a deterioration in the faith in and image of
liberal international order en masse:

\[It has\] become increasingly apparent that support for the liberal
international order in Europe and the United States is declining, as
well \[as in revisionist states like China and Russia,\]... since the
British vote to the leave the European Union last June and the U.S.
presidential election last November --- not least because the United
Kingdom and the United States are two of the countries historically most
associated with liberalism and were generally thought to be most
committed to it. (German Marshall Fund)

Though today's political field seems to be more polarized than ever,
this deterioration spans both liberal and conservative factions.

The recent, aggressive rise in [[populism comes in tandem with the
worldwide alt-right's]{.underline}]{.mark} stark [[rejection of
**l**]{.underline}]{.mark}iberal
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**nternational
**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**rder, global governance necessitating a
degree of multinational collaboration that threatens extreme
conservatives' perception of national sovereignty. In the States,
alt-right news platforms attack the United Nations as a liberal-loving,
anti-American institution, while conservative propaganda paints "global
management" as a once-secret scheme to "control" the whole world via
dangerous "regulation" (Blaze TV). One article from Breitbart News
Media, entitled "New United Nations Boss Unveils Plan to Promote Global
Mass Migration," expresses the extreme right's outrage at Secretary
General Antonio Guterres' recent brief:

\[Guterres\] made the contentious claim that migrants "take jobs" that
local workers "cannot" fill, and asserted that this is a positive thing.
He also attempted to spin the fact that migrants send huge sums of money
straight out of their host countries and back to their countries of
origin as a kind of supplement to foreign aid. (Breitbart)

The elections of populist politicians like Brazil's Bolsonaro and
Italy's Salvini, who tout their unapologetic nationalist policies, are
an unmitigated indication of how deep-seated the fear of globalization
runs among the alt-right. Trump's "withdrawal from the Paris climate
accords and the trans-pacific partnership, his goal of renegotiating
\[NAFTA\], his threats to undo the US-South Korea trade deal and the
Iran Nuclear Deal, as well as his criticism of our NATO allies and
alliances" remind us that such figures really do have the power to
hinder liberal international order (CNN).

Ironically, the far-left's disapproval of global governance also stems,
in part, from a fear that it encroaches on nations' sovereignty.
Liberals who dislike liberal order tend to view it as an anachronistic
system driven by the self-interest and power-hunger of the West, a
dynamic entrenched in the structures of its most vital institutions.
That the UN's most powerful branch -- the Security Council -- is
permanently home to the five western victors of WWII seems malapropos to
many, especially since recent efforts to grow its permanent membership
have been "stymied" (New York Times). The most extreme of liberal
order's [[critics hold]{.underline}]{.mark} that this and other
realities of [[global governance reek of
neocolonialism]{.underline}]{.mark}; that, in pushing for worldwide
democratic ideals, these institutions promote "foreign economic
exploitation or coercive political domination" of weaker states by
superpower nations, especially through "forcible exportation of
democracy throughout the world," the implication of which "is
infringement upon others' sovereignty and self-determination" (Jackson,
162). To many, this proves a satisfactory explanation for the numerous
failures of global order's past; such hegemonic policy must inevitably
miscarry. An example that many point to is Responsibility to Protect, or
"R2P," a UN doctrine that came about after the terrible failing on the
part of the world to help the Rwandan people during the genocide, a
doctrine some see as "guided by fables of moral innocence and
righteousness" that was ultimately a "threat to the legitimacy \[of the
international system\]" after it was faulted for the disaster in
post-Qaddafi Libya (New York Times).

My intent with this article is not to defend the failures of liberal
international order, but to defend the concept. While criticisms of
liberal order are absolutely valid and must be acknowledged, they do not
excuse the abandonment of global governance. When you denounce liberal
world order, you denounce all that it stands for -- not just its
perceived connotations of western hegemony. At its core, liberal
international order is a principle, not an institution to be dissolved.
It is a principle of multinational collaboration and fellowship, a
principle intended to represent and fulfill our reformist aspirations.
Its triumphs -- the UN's 172 successful regional peace settlements,
their role in the standardization of human rights, their unprecedented
environmentalist work -- should not be taken lightly (PBS). The
[faults]{.underline} and the failures [of liberal international
order]{.underline}, and there [are many]{.underline}, have had grave
consequences. However, that one should reduce humanitarianism to an
excuse for complacency -- an alibi -- is a gross generalization and a
shocking oversimplification, especially given that this same skeptic
would be first to cry "neo-imperialism" at the implementation of
interventionist policies (Barnett, 180). [[The mitigation of
international conflict is]{.underline}]{.mark} ipso facto a complex and
[[difficult]{.underline}]{.mark} task[, [something]{.mark}]{.underline}
that I find many [[critics]{.mark} of liberal order willingly [look
past]{.mark}. It is easy to criticize]{.underline}, especially if it's
deserved; what is missing is the afterthought, the constructive
deliberation over how to fix what's wrong. [[In the absence of a]{.mark}
proposed [alternative]{.mark}, such [denunciations]{.mark}]{.underline}
of liberal international order **[[come from]{.mark} a place of
[privilege]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To me, [[this says you'll never be
victim to chemical warfare, you'll never fear]{.mark} that [your
government might massacre your family]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [[it makes
**no difference to you** whether there is an imperfect safety
net]{.mark} in place [or none]{.mark} at all]{.underline}. **[[Only the
privileged can afford to be so nihilistic]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[[Perfection is the enemy of good,]{.mark} and it is simply ahistorical
to expect a worldwide framework of peace to be perfect]{.underline};
[such [a world where justice was executed faultlessly has]{.mark} simply
**[never existed]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

"[[In many countries, things are **moving in the right
direction**]{.underline}]{.mark}, sometimes not quickly enough,
sometimes it's not perfect, but nevertheless, they are moving [and the
broader impact is clear]{.underline}," said Chilean UN Commissioner for
Human Rights Michelle Bachelet at a recent UN event in New York City (UN
News). While this may seem rather dispirited, what she says is true.
[[Global governance]{.underline}]{.mark} is imperfect, humanitarianism
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} too often [[served the self-interests of the
powerful]{.underline}]{.mark}, and interventionist policies have, in
some cases, caused irreparable damage to regions in conflict. And
[[yet,]{.underline}]{.mark} [[in place of liberal order,]{.mark} what do
we have?]{.underline} [[Are we willing to **surrender the fate of our
world to**]{.mark} the **[Trumpian demagogues]{.mark}**]{.underline} of
our time? [[That world would]{.mark} certainly [not be]{.mark} any [less
self-servicing than the one we live in today]{.mark}]{.underline}. As we
progress through the 21st century, an era of unavoidable multinational
interrelatedness, [we must look to those with]{.underline}
[vision]{.underline} and good intent [to reform global
governance]{.underline} systems -- **[not to abandon
them]{.underline}**. Perhaps we shift the focus of global governance
from democratic ideals to those less-partisan. Perhaps we restructure
the UN bodies in an attempt to change archaic power dynamics therein.
But one thing is certain: [[in the face of transnational threats,
including climate change, it is]{.mark} the **[reform]{.mark}**ation --
and [not the rejection -- of **l**]{.mark}iberal
**[i]{.mark}**nternational **[o]{.mark}**rder [that will be our
salvation]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Vetting Results and Their Use

By and large, [most vettings filed through the INVEST system conclude
with an approval]{.underline}. Vettings recently have ended in denial
around 1% or less of the time, **[and a suspension about 9% of the time,
according to figures provided in news reports]{.underline}**.33 CQ
Weekly reports that training was withheld "for a variety of reasons,
including the possibility that there was credible information that the
person or unit involved had committed a gross violation of human
rights," and for administrative difficulties.34 In some cases, [training
was suspended if derogatory information other than a human rights
violation was found,]{.underline} as candidates may be excluded for
other undesirable behavior. [In the many cases where training was
suspended for administrative reasons, it was subsequently rescheduled
once the problem was resolved, according to that source.]{.underline}

In general, [vetting results are used to determine who will receive U.S.
assistance or training]{.underline}. They also form the basis for
reporting to foreign governments under the FAA "duty-to-inform"
provision when members and units of their security forces fail vetting
and assistance is denied. According to some U.S. policy makers, even
though only the FAA contains the "duty-to-inform" requirement, in
practice the provision should extend also to DOD-funded cases. The logic
of this requirement is to garner cooperation with the law, encourage
improved compliance by host governments with human rights standards, and
make clear that U.S. assistance will not be provided to human rights
violators. In addition, [the FAA provides that the State Department
should offer assistance to a foreign "host" government to investigate
and prosecute suspected human rights violators who have been identified
through the vetting process.]{.underline}
