#### Settler colonialism theory disregards the resilience of indigenous people and progress like Standing Rock -- it plays into the narrative of the inevitable victory of the Cowboys over Indians

[For Indians, defeat]{.underline} in the face of American Progress and
Manifest Destiny [was supposed to be a foregone conclusion]{.underline}.
In John Gast's iconic 1872 painting "American Progress," a youthful
blonde woman clutching a schoolbook in her right hand and laying down
telegraph wire with her left shepherds prospectors, farmers, and
settlers westward as tribes and wildlife flee before her advance. In the
more familiar Spaghetti Western version of the same tale, [Indians rise
up out of the wilderness, put up a fierce but ultimately tragic fight,
and then succumb to the inevitability of Cowboy Progress. Last year, an
indigenous-led coalition just north of the Standing Rock reservation
along the banks of the Missouri and Cannonball rivers revived frontier
insurgency]{.underline}. This time, the America they confronted was
clutching the aspiration for "energy independence" in her right hand and
laying down the Dakota Access pipeline with her left. She shepherded
forward Energy Transfer Partners CEO, Dallas billionaire, and robber
baron Kelcy Warren, alongside North Dakota governor Jack Dalrymple --- a
modern-day Custer who unleashed a militarized police force on unarmed
water protectors. With a brutal Great Plains winter weeks away, America
braced for the inevitable. **["How can this possibly end well?" the New
York Times editorial board asked in November. But then the seemingly
impossible happened]{.underline}**. At the eleventh hour, [the
Department of the Army denied an essential easement that would've
allowed the Dakota Access Pipeline to cross under the Missouri River and
ordered an Environmental Impact Statement to assess and consider
alternative routes for the project. **The Indians won.**]{.underline}
They may have been outgunned by a militarized police force armed with
water cannons, concussion grenades, rubber bullets, pepper spray,
Humvees, and an immense and opaque state surveillance apparatus, but
[they outflanked and outwitted politicians and oil barons trying to
ham-hand a pipeline through the sacred graves of their ancestors, their
sovereign community, and their water supply]{.underline}. Thousands
joined them in their encampments and direct actions. Countless others
donated, sent supplies, and organized in solidarity with their movement.
1.4 million people checked into Standing Rock on Facebook to show
support. Veterans arrived from across the country to protect the Indians
from the very government they had signed up to serve. Their captivating,
organized, and massively popular movement to stop Dakota Access and
protect water that sustains life called Americans and the world to the
cause of indigenous rights like never before. But [it would be a
terrible mistake to characterize the victory at Standing Rock as
fleeting, or as an out-of-the-blue eruption. Indians and their
indigenous cousins around the world have long been organizing,
**litigating**, and fighting for wins like Standing Rock.]{.underline}
Today, as runaway climate change threatens to scorch the earth, they
have demonstrated that indigenous rights and sovereignty --- long denied
and ignored --- are essential to protecting the waters and lands where
capital's concerns are transient and motivated by profit, but where
indigenous ancestors are buried and Native children grow up hoping for a
better future. [At Standing Rock, the first people of this
land]{.underline} --- the poorest, the most likely to be killed by law
enforcement, and the most easily forgotten --- won a monumental victory
for indigenous rights, the planet, and the forces of conscience against
capital. In doing so, they didn't just refute the myth of indigenous
obsolescence. They [seized the reins of progress, opening up new
frontiers of struggle for the many Standing Rocks that lie
ahead.]{.underline} The Feathers-and-Failure Fallacy American folklore
and common sense say that Indians don't win. It should come as no
surprise, then, that the blathering commentariat was baffled by
indigenous victory at Standing Rock. More troubling, however, is that
historians, social scientists, and political theorists also often buy
into the feathers-and-failure narrative. [Consider, for example, the
most cited work in the fields of settler colonial and indigenous
studies: "Settler Colonialism and the Elimination of the Native," a 2006
essay by the late radical Australian anthropologist Patrick
Wolfe.]{.underline} In a clever turn of phrase, repeated today like a
Feuerbach Thesis for indigenous radicals and scholars, [Wolfe described
the invasion of indigenous lands as "a structure not an
event."]{.underline} His argument was that [settler
colonialism]{.underline} --- a form of colonialism where colonists come
to stay, as in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South
Africa, Palestine, and some Pacific Islands --- [requires the
elimination of Native people and societies to access and occupy their
land. As Wolfe put it, "Settler colonialism destroys to
replace."]{.underline} Wolfe's theory of settler colonialism emerged out
of the ongoing "History Wars" in Australia, a public, battle-hardened,
and career-defining debate over whether Australia's treatment of
Aborigines should be considered genocide. For decades, specialists have
squabbled over the numbers massacred at places like Tasman and
Slaughterhouse Creek. These debates remain passionate and deeply
controversial. They are tied to political battles over land rights,
reconciliation, constitutional recognition, mass incarceration, racism,
and Aboriginal treaties. But while his contemporaries tried to win the
History Wars by appealing to documents, figures, and definitions, [Wolfe
sought to reframe the debate.]{.underline} He shifted the focus from
determining the point at which butcheries become genocide to the "logic"
of eliminating indigenous people over centuries and around the world.
[Settler colonialism, he argued, is a structural phenomenon that plays
an ongoing and central role in shaping the modern world. Wolfe's was a
brilliant intervention]{.underline}. In the jargon-riddled field of
postcolonial studies, he homed in on the empires, colonies, states, and
territories of ongoing settlement and indigenous dispossession. His
theory traveled well. For indigenous scholars and activists from the
United States to Palestine and Canada to New Zealand, "settler
colonialism" became the dominant framework for understanding ongoing
Fourth World struggles. **[But Wolfe's theory ran into a rather
significant problem --- reality. If settler societies]{.underline}**
like Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States **[are
structurally dependent upon the elimination of the Native, how do we
explain the survival, resilience, and resurgence of that same
Native?]{.underline}** [How do we explain the global emergence of
policies of indigenous self-determination, recognition, and land rights
in various forms? Are these policies lipstick on the same colonial pig?
Are indigenous people permanently cast in cameo roles --- their
victories small exceptions that prove the rule? **How do we explain
Standing Rock?** Wolfe's theory]{.underline}, however popular and
illuminating, [is in a sense, a gussied-up version of the inevitable
victory of Cowboys over Indians **--- a reworking of Victorian ideology
as critical theory.**]{.underline} **[The indigenous story unfolding
before us demands more.]{.underline}**

#### Politics works for indigenous people -- empirics prove

The Fourth World and a Fourth Way On November 14, the Army Corps of
Engineers temporarily halted DAPL's progress, stating that "the history
of the Great Sioux Nation's dispossessions of lands" and the United
States' "government-to-government" relationship with indigenous nations
demanded that the route of the proposed pipeline be reassessed. The Army
told Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), the company building DAPL, that
construction beneath the Missouri River required explicit approval, and
asked the Standing Rock Sioux to negotiate conditions for the pipeline
to cross tribal territory. Faced with a momentary victory for Standing
Rock, Kelcy Warren, Dallas billionaire and CEO of ETP, denounced the
decision as "motivated purely by politics at the expense of a company
that has done nothing but play by the rules." Warren was right. [Had it
not been for thousands of people mobilizing behind an indigenous-led
coalition, DAPL would have been business as usual.]{.underline} ETP
would have desecrated the graves of Standing Rock ancestors unimpeded.
Workers, lured by relatively high wages, would have taken on toxic and
insecure work. The tribe's hunting and fishing grounds would have been
jeopardized, and if the pipeline leaked, Standing Rock and its
downstream communities would have been poisoned. Environmental
degradation and runaway climate change would have pressed ahead
unabated. Carbon dependency would have become even more deeply engrained
in our political economy. Eventually, ETP and their investors would have
cashed out, and future generations would have been robbed. And [**all of
this still will happen if President Obama doesn't heed the water
protectors and instead sides with ETP.** ETP]{.underline} spent \$1.2
million over the last five years [paying politicians to legislate in its
favor]{.underline}. Warren personally donated [\$103,000 to the Trump
campaign]{.underline}. [**But when indigenous people organized, turning
to direct action and the law to pressure elected officials and
government systems, they wrested power from ETP's hands.** DAPL is just
one chapter in a much longer story of indigenous resistance to, and
victories against, pipelines across North America]{.underline}. In 2015,
the Obama administration nixed the [Keystone XL Pipeline]{.underline},
yielding to pressure from the Cowboy Indian Alliance. In Minnesota,
Enbridge shelved plans for the [Sandpiper pipeline]{.underline}, after
encountering tribal opposition. [The Unist'ot'en camp in northern
British Columbia]{.underline} has held out against numerous proposed
pipelines through their territory, building a space where indigenous
sovereignty stands tall on lands defined by industry as an "energy
corridor." The American and Canadian oil industries are more vulnerable
than we realize. Fracked oil from the Bakken and Tar Sands is expensive
to extract and refine. Meanwhile, OPEC is pumping at breakneck speed,
driving down global oil prices. Oil infrastructure is costly, not only
for indigenous people, workers, and the environment, but for investors
too. Canadian oil producers have sold crude at a loss. The North Dakota
and Tar Sands oil booms have busted. Indigenous opposition to pipelines
through their territories has made investors uneasy. ETP was concerned
that their \$3.7 billion pipeline would be cancelled. Just this week,
Warren used another one of his companies, Sunoco, to buy ETP for \$20
billion in order to cut his losses. The move will lower profits for
shareholders of ETP in order to protect profits for Energy Transfer
Equities (ETE), the DAPL umbrella company in which Warren owns more than
10 percent of shares. Simply put, in the face of massive opposition, the
Dallas billionaire reshuffled his companies at shareholders' expense in
order to safeguard and grow his own vast fortune. [The show of force
against indigenous protesters, however brutal, is an act of desperation
to protect his infinitely deep pockets]{.underline}. If DAPL is not
moving oil by the New Year, shipping contractors can cancel their
transportation agreements. Warren's time is running out. **[Standing
Rock, on the other hand, is the future]{.underline}**. Populism is
killing the "Third Way" politics advocated by Bill Clinton, Tony Blair,
and their equivalents around the world. **[This is the Fourth
Way.]{.underline}** The Fourth Way will [harness the power and strategic
location of indigenous people, exploiting pressure points beyond the
workplace to oppose and transform unjust, unequal, and undemocratic
systems. Movements working to reshape infrastructure, environmental
policy, financial systems, policing, and work]{.underline} will be of
particular importance to indigenous people. [Fossil fuel divestment and
the "Keep It in the Ground" movement]{.underline} can weaken and even
undermine companies seeking to exploit fossil fuels on indigenous lands.
[Regulations that dismantle financial instruments and policies that
profit from natural resource speculation]{.underline} could divert and
damage returns on capital flows. [The abolition of mass
incarceration]{.underline} would loosen the death grip of prisons and
police on indigenous communities. [Unions can turn individual workers
into collective forces of resistance]{.underline}, helping drive up
costs for developers and protect laborers from unsafe working
conditions. Long-term efforts to reimagine work through [full automation
and a universal basic income]{.underline} could prevent laborers from
having to seek such dangerous work in the first place. As Standing Rock
has shown, **[indigenous nations that use their unique standing to
advocate for viable alternatives to unjust systems will gain
supporters.]{.underline}** Our traditional territories encompass the
rivers, mountains, and forests that capital exploits with abandon.
**[Our resistance]{.underline}** --- to the pipelines, bulldozers, and
mines that cut through our lands and communities --- **[has greater
potential than yet realized]{.underline}**. Ours is a powerful voice
envisioning a more harmonious and sustainable relationship with the
natural world rooted in the resurgence of indigenous sovereignty. **[As
long as indigenous people continue to make this argument, we are
positioned to win policies, court decisions, and international
agreements that protect and enlarge our sovereignty and
jurisdiction]{.underline}**. As our jurisdiction and sovereignty grow,
we will have more power to stop, reroute, and transform carbon-based,
capitalist, and colonial infrastructure. When the Justice Department
halted construction of DAPL in October, they also said they would begin
looking into Free Prior Informed Consent legislation. This is a minimal
first step, and we must hold them to it. **[Longstanding alliances with
progressive parties and politicians are key to our
success]{.underline}**. In the United States, Native people have worked
with Democratic elected officials like [Bernie Sanders and Raúl Grijalva
to advance bills like the Save Oak Flat Act]{.underline}, which aimed to
stop an international mining conglomerate from exploiting an Apache
sacred site in Arizona. In Canada, First Nations have supported [the New
Democratic Party.]{.underline} In New Zealand, the Maori Rātana
religious and political movement has an alliance with [the Labour
Party]{.underline} that stretches back to the 1930s. Some indigenous
leaders, such as outspoken Aboriginal Australian leader [Pat
Dodson]{.underline}, a Labour senator for Western Australia, have won
prominent positions in these parties. [This does not mean]{.underline},
of course, [that we should pay deference to elected
officials]{.underline}. In 2014, Obama became one of the first sitting
presidents to visit an Indian reservation when he travelled to Standing
Rock. His visit was historically symbolic and emotionally important, but
[if Obama fails to stop DAPL, indigenous people should renounce
him]{.underline}. Politicians are helpful when they change policies and
outcomes. **[We cannot and should not settle for symbolic
victories.]{.underline}** If there is to be an enduring indigenous-left
coalition, [the Left must support indigenous demands for land,
jurisdiction, and sovereignty]{.underline}. At their core, **[these
demands undermine the imperial cut-and-paste model of the
nation-state]{.underline}**, stretching from Hobbes to the present,
which insists that there is room for just one sovereign entity in the
state apparatus. Thomas Piketty's call for a global wealth tax implies
an international governance structure to levy such a tax. He pushes us
to think beyond the state. Similarly, indigenous demands for lands,
jurisdiction, and sovereignty imply that we must think beneath it. As
the Fourth World continues to push states to recognize our inherent,
constitutional, and treaty rights as sovereign nations, the Left cannot
remain neutral. To remain neutral is to perpetuate a long history of
colonization. To remain neutral is to lose a valuable, organized, and
powerful ally.

### State Good -- Tier 2

#### Political reforms have historically [worked]{.underline} -- and the rising wave of right-wing populism means indigenous people have no choice but to engage

The View From Standing Rock On October 27, police clad in riot gear
sweep through a camp of indigenous water protectors along the banks of
the Missouri and Cannonball rivers, just north of the present-day
boundary of the [Standing Rock]{.underline} Sioux reservation. This
community, alive with song, dance, and prayer, [is the last line of
defense against the Dakota Access Pipeline]{.underline} (DAPL), a nearly
1,200-mile-long pipe that will carry Bakken crude from North Dakota's
fracking fields to Illinois. Their rallying cry is "Mni Wiconi," Lakota
for "Water is Life." A group of water protectors gather in prayer along
the banks of the Cannonball River. Police descend a hill to the
riverbank, and unleash clouds of pepper spray and a hail of rubber
bullets and beanbag rounds. Meanwhile, a standoff unfolds next to
Backwater Bridge on North Dakota's Highway 1806. Unarmed protectors hold
hands. Thirty yards up the road, two columns of over one hundred law
enforcement officers flanked by armored personnel carriers, Humvees, and
a high-frequency sound cannon assemble in attack formation. Hundreds of
miles around, stretching across present-day South Dakota, Nebraska, and
Wyoming, lies the territory of the Oceti Sakowin, or Great Sioux Nation,
guaranteed to the Lakota, Nakota, and Dakota people under the 1851 Fort
Laramie Treaty. This ocean of grass is the site of some of the nation's
most iconic conflicts: Red Cloud's War of 1866--8 and the Great Sioux
War of 1876, the Fetterman Fight in 1866 and the Battle of the Little
Bighorn in 1876, Wounded Knee in 1890 and its liberation in 1973. The
police, batons drawn, march lockstep toward the protesters. America's
frontier legend, diligently recounted to every American child in every
American classroom for well over a century, is poised for replay. The
next evening, the cowboys are gloating. They have rounded up 139
protesters. The charges? Engaging in a riot, plus conspiracy to endanger
by fire and explosion. North Dakota governor Jack Dalrymple declares
that the police have successfully cleared out the camp. "Our state
highways and county highways and private property is not the place to
carry out a peaceful protest," he tells the press. He says nothing about
treaty lands legally claimed and defended by a sovereign indigenous
nation. The Indians refuse to recede. Felony charges are later dropped.
[With each show of police force, more protectors pour into
camps]{.underline} already more than five thousand strong. Within weeks,
[the largest bank in Norway pulls its assets from the project. Pundits
call on President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential nominee
Hillary Clinton to speak out against the pipeline. The New York Times
editorial board insists that the pipeline be rerouted]{.underline}. For
the first time since the Occupation of Wounded Knee in 1973, **[an
international audience is hearing and responding to the grievances of
America's first people.]{.underline}** The cowboys may have outgunned
the unarmed Indians, but they are being outwitted, outflanked, and
out-strategized by a massive, transnational, indigenous-led movement.
Facebook Live is their primary media channel, but [stories about the
water protectors are jumping across the divide from social to mainstream
media]{.underline}, appearing in the New York Times and on CNN and
Saturday Night Live. Support is growing. **[Indians are broadening the
frontier of political possibility]{.underline}**. [Their assertion of
sovereignty]{.underline} --- against a pipeline and for basic human
rights, including water that sustains life --- [is the way
forward]{.underline}. T**[he Fourth World, too long ignored, is defining
a "Fourth Way" for the Left]{.underline}**. The Dance With the State The
next day, the standoff resumes. But this time, law enforcement faces
dozens of indigenous women moving to the healing rhythms of the jingle
dress dance. With each step, the governor's decision to send one hundred
National Guardsmen to quash the peaceful protectors looks more and more
preposterous. The jingle dress originated with the Oceti Sakowin's
ancestral enemies to the east, the Ojibwe, who call the dance ziibaaska
'iganagooday. According to oral traditions from the Mille Lacs and
Whitefish Bay Ojibwe, a father dreamed the dance would cure his ailing
daughter and their community of Spanish influenza. The dance emerged
just as Washington lawmakers enacted the Dance Order of 1921, which
banned ritualistic dance on reservations. This attack on culture built
on the Dawes Act of 1887, which partitioned and privatized reservation
lands. In flagrant violation of the prohibition, and as the American and
Canadian governments ripped indigenous children from their families and
cultures to send them to boarding and residential schools, the jingle
dress dance spread across the United States and Canada. Today, it is one
of the most popular, moving, and dignified women's dances on the
contemporary powwow circuit. On Oceti Sakowin territory, the jingle
dress is a symbol both of women's strength and of solidarity with
ancient enemies uniting for a common cause. The jingle dress dancers
illuminate Maori feminist historian Aroha Harris's theory and metaphor
of the "dance with the state" --- the push and pull of indigenous
peoples' resistance to state efforts to eliminate, dispossess, and
assimilate them. Harris references the Haka, a Maori dance used to
intimidate enemies and welcome guests, as a metaphor for the ways that
Maori have effectively resisted, manipulated, and sidestepped the state
over time. The Haka, which is emblematic of anti-imperialism, is all
over Facebook, offered up by Maori communities in solidarity with the
Mni Wiconi cause. Maori have even composed a special Haka for Standing
Rock. Many Americans, Canadians, Australians, and New Zealanders believe
that indigenous people are long gone and defeated. Inheritors of the
imperial myth of "Manifest Destiny," they presume the colonizers'
victory was inevitable and even predetermined. This racist myth has led
[empires and states to underestimate indigenous power. Global histories
of indigenous resistance, survival, and resurgence tell another
story.]{.underline} On these Oceti Sakowin plains in 1876, a cocksure
General Custer rushed into the Battle of the Little Bighorn only to be
soundly defeated by allied Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho forces.
Dalrymple appears poised to repeat Custer's mistake. Countless
indigenous communities, nations, and confederacies from the Americas to
Australasia, and South Africa to Siberia, including Aboriginal
Australians, Apache, Arapaho, Cherokee, Cheyenne, Chukchi, Comanche,
Cree, Creek, Diné, Hawaiian, Haudenosaunee, Kiowa, Maori, Modoc, Nez
Perce, Pueblo, Salish, Sauk, Seminole, Shawnee, Tasmans, Tlingit, Ute,
Xhosa, Yakima, Zulu, and others have resisted imperial powers and
industrial states and prevailed. Before defeating Custer, the Oceti
Sakowin had a long history of settler handling. In 1862, the Dakota
pushed thousands of settlers off the Minnesota frontier. Six years
later, the Lakota defeated the United States Army in Red Cloud's War.
Retribution followed many indigenous victories. In California, entire
communities were hunted like animals. After taking dozens of Dakota men
as prisoners of war following the uprising of 1862, Abraham Lincoln
signed an order to execute thirty-eight of them --- the largest mass
execution in American history. Later in 1890, the United States Army
gunned down three hundred Lakota at Wounded Knee. This history continues
to devastate. [Indigenous people remain the poorest of the poor and the
most likely to be killed by law enforcement.]{.underline} Four of the
fifteen most impoverished counties in the United States include Lakota
reservations in South Dakota. The two poorest, Oglala Lakota and Todd
County, lie entirely within the Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations,
where half of all residents live in poverty. In Ziebach County, which
includes parts of the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River reservations, 45
percent of the population lives at or below the poverty line. Elsewhere
in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, [indigenous
people are among the poorest, most oppressed, and least visible. They
are overrepresented in prisons and underrepresented in
universities]{.underline}. Their economic realities are bleak. Their
pain is intergenerational. In short, [**colonialism endures. Yet these
same communities are uniquely positioned to resist unjust systems and
force them to retreat**. We must hold these two seemingly contradictory
realities of devastation and resilience in our minds at the same
time.]{.underline} [The Fourth World lives in devastation. The Fourth
World is unconquered and on the rise.]{.underline} Since the 1970s,
**[indigenous people]{.underline}** in the United States, Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand **[have danced impressive
victories]{.underline}**. They have [compelled states to forego
assimilationist policies like the involuntary removal of indigenous
children to abusive residential schools and the relocation of indigenous
workers to cities.]{.underline} Overtly coercive policies have been
slowly and steadily replaced with [policies that recognize indigenous
rights to land, jurisdiction, and sovereignty.]{.underline} **[Gains are
limited, but they are still gains]{.underline}**. At certain times over
the past thirty years, [indigenous claims have prevented corporations
from exploiting natural resources]{.underline}. In New Zealand in the
1980s, [Maori claims under the Treaty of Waitangi]{.underline} stopped a
state drive to privatize fisheries and hydroelectric power. In Canada
and Australia, from the 1990s to the present, aboriginal claims have
[increased risk for prospective investors in extractive
industries]{.underline}. But the dance with the state can be perilous.
In recent decades, some indigenous groups mistook neoliberals who
denounced "big government" for allies. They accepted land claims
settlements, treaty agreements, and business deals that enabled states
to slash social services for the most vulnerable while restructuring
indigenous communities as junior corporate partners in the global
economy. As Trump prepares to take power in the US and Brexit changes
the economic calculus in Britain and across the world, it is clear that
[the dance with the state is entering a new age]{.underline}. The New
Colonialism The new age has precedents. Any Howard Zinn reader knows
that the United States is built on stolen land with stolen labor.
However, this is an observation too imprecise to help us understand and
predict the trajectory of a global political economy steered and shaped
by the likes of Trump and Nigel Farage. If you squint hard enough, Jack
Dalrymple might look like a young George Custer, but that does not make
him so. [To prevail, indigenous people and the Left must fully
understand the precise ways that emerging systems will dispossess
indigenous communities]{.underline}. In the nineteenth century, the
United States Army incarcerated indigenous people on reservations,
claimed land for homesteaders, protected prospectors, and cleared the
way for railroad barons. In the 1960s, a different set of historical,
political, and economic forces erected the Lake Oahe Dam on the Missouri
River, flooding two hundred thousand acres of the Standing Rock
reservation to provide power to suburban homeowners. Today, the drive
for independence from OPEC sees a solution in [hydraulic fracturing
technology]{.underline}. North American oil fields and infrastructure
are funded by a financial system that encourages speculation, drives
massive inequality, and fails to account for costs associated with human
and environmental risks --- passing these very real risks and
consequences on to communities, workers, and indigenous nations.
Inherently unaccountable capitalists are paid big money for being even
more unaccountable, and indigenous dispossession continues on new
frontiers. Preliminary post-election forecasts indicate that [Trump's
victory and Brexit will redirect capital back toward the American West
and the British Commonwealth]{.underline}. In particular, Trump --- a
DAPL investor himself --- will expedite completion of DAPL and similar
projects. He will push to reopen and complete the Keystone XL Pipeline.
If he keeps his campaign promises, he will [support infrastructure
projects and extractive industries, including coal and fracking, in
indigenous homelands]{.underline} across the American hinterlands. At
the same time, [a conservative Supreme Court]{.underline}, an Interior
Department led by [Sarah Palin]{.underline} or oil baron [Lucas
Forrest]{.underline}, and a Justice Department led by [Jeff Sessions
means limited but hard-won Native rights will be rolled
back]{.underline}. If this gang of reactionary appointees can't figure
out how to dismantle complex legal precedents, [they can
just]{.underline} cut funding to essential services like housing,
schools, and health care that are already woefully underfunded,
[put]{.underline}ting [tribes in a stranglehold of
austerity]{.underline}. Native resistance will be policed by [Orwellian
surveillance systems]{.underline} finely tuned by the Obama
administration. [Militarized law enforcement]{.underline} will find
reinforcements in the booming private security and prison industries.
Surveillance, state law enforcement, and private security will drive
[mass arrests]{.underline}, as we're seeing at Standing Rock. **[Law
enforcement will have more power]{.underline}** than ever to quash
protesters and silence dissent. In the former British Wests of Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand, where the right-wing populist revolution has
yet to take hold in the same way, suppression of indigenous resistance
may be less visibly coercive --- perhaps with the exception of
skyrocketing policing, incarceration, and deaths-in-custody of
indigenous people, particularly Aboriginal Australians (the "most
imprisoned people in the world"). [Politicians in the Commonwealth will
look to roll back or restructure indigenous rights won over the last
three decades in ways that are favorable to capital.]{.underline}
**[Governments]{.underline}**, like Justin Trudeau's Liberals in Canada,
**[are already abandoning campaign promises to indigenous
people]{.underline}**, opting instead to grab land and resources (as
seen in the ham-fisted effort to force through the Site C Dam against
indigenous opposition). Trudeau's minister of natural resources has
already stated that Canada will no longer ask First Nations for consent
before going forward with lucrative natural resource projects like
Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain Expansion project and Enbridge's Northern
Gateway pipelines. In Australia, the government is steamrolling the
Wangan and Jagalingou peoples' Native Title claims in order to move
forward with the massive Carmichael Coalmine in Queensland. With the
Commonwealth clamoring to cash in on opportunities created by Brexit,
new free trade deals with the United Kingdom will be struck,
resuscitating and rebuilding the capital networks of the former British
Empire, previously weakened by globalization and the European Single
Market. The Tory dream of a revived Anglosphere, long derided as
fanciful, nostalgic, and bad business by Liberals, may even emerge as a
legitimate principle and framework of international relations and trade.
It will compete with increasingly powerful Chinese and Indian capital
throughout the Commonwealth, as already witnessed in the Canadian tar
sands, Australian coalmines, and New Zealand real estate and dairy.
Combined with the rise of China and India, this will [bring new waves of
exploitive capital into indigenous homelands, along with increased
policing and the dismantling of indigenous rights]{.underline}. Renewed
colonial and capitalist pressure on indigenous people means that [the
Fourth World's adversarial relationship with the state will become more
central to the struggle to transform political and economic systems for
all]{.underline}. If the history of the indigenous dance with the state
is any indication, the Fourth World will suffer tremendously while at
the same time standing athwart the forces of capitalism and
exploitation. **[The Left must stand with the Fourth World in our
collective struggle.]{.underline}**

Struggle Without End On November 15, [more than 1,500 protesters
gathered in Foley Square in Manhattan]{.underline}. With songs and
chants of "Water is life," we expressed our solidarity with Standing
Rock, [and sent a strong message to Obama and the Army Corps of
Engineers]{.underline}, whose offices lie just across the street:
**[rescind DAPL]{.underline}**. [We were just a fraction of the
thousands]{.underline} who came together in cities across the country
that day. Marching into the street, a few dozen of us locked arms, sat
down and stopped traffic in an act of civil disobedience. We refused to
move. We became the bodies blocking the behemoth. Police corralled us.
An automated announcement warned us that we faced imminent arrest if we
refused to move. The machine blared louder and louder: "you are
unlawfully in the roadway and blocking vehicular traffic . . ." We
responded with even louder chants and songs to drown out the machine.
The officers tightened their ranks and arrested us one by one. In jail,
I was surprised to learn that I was just one of two indigenous
arrestees. The radical potential of July's canoe journey had spread
farther and wider than anything we'd imagined just a few months earlier.
[We can still stop the Dakota Access pipeline. The police may turn water
cannons on us, assault and maim us, and lock us up, but we own the
momentum. And even if we fail to defeat this pipeline, we will have
prevailed in many battles along the way, and we can still win the long
war]{.underline}. As we seek a way forward amid an ascendant right,
**[the Fourth World has opened up a new window of political
possibility]{.underline}**. [The Left must stand with them and start
stitching their successful formula for resistance and transformation
together with movements for economic, racial, environmental, gender, and
sexual justice into a winning coalition. **This is, and always has been,
a long and difficult struggle of incremental victories and
defeats**]{.underline}. For the first people of this continent, it has
raged for centuries. It is, as the late Maori intellectual and activist
Ranginui Walker put it in Ka Whawhai Tonu Matou, a "Struggle Without
End." The title of Walker's book refers to the legendary words of Rewi
Maniapoto, a Maori King Movement leader, who responded to a call to
surrender at the Battle of Orakau in 1864, with these immortal lines:
"Ka whawhai tonu matou, Ake! Ake! Ake!" [We will fight on, forever and
ever and ever. As we fight on, the songs and dances of our indigenous
resistance find new steps, new verses, and new voices.]{.underline}

#### Political involvement is historically an important tool for indigenous rights -- simultaneously working in and out of the system is best

**Noisecat, enrolled member of the Canim Lake Band Tsq\'escen in British
Columbia and a graduate of Columbia University and the University of

Explaining Standing Rock [The Cowboy is supposed to be everything the
Indian is not]{.underline}. While the Indian is depicted as a tragic
vanquished trope, the Cowboy is a handsome, swaggering, and triumphant
trickster. While the Indian retreats into the wild, the Cowboy hunts
down his enemies to settle old scores. While the Indian is at best a
noble savage and at worst a villain, the Cowboy is a cultural icon and
hero. And, [while the Indian is a loser, the Cowboy is a
winner]{.underline}. **[At Standing Rock, generations of myth and folk
wisdom proved wrong]{.underline}**. As Bill McKibben put it in the
Guardian, the Standing Rock movement "is [a break in that long-running
story, a new chapter]{.underline}." In a moment when the Left is
struggling in the face of a globalizing free market and an ascendant
right, [indigenous victory stands as both a surprising puzzle and an
intriguing promise]{.underline}. [It begs the rarely considered
question: **why have indigenous people been able to secure a stunning
victory while even the most successful movements of late have
faltered?**]{.underline} And what can other movements learn from
Indians? Various voices have risen to offer answers. Writing in the
Nation, Audrea Lim argues that Standing Rock shows a multiracial
coalition united against neoliberalism and white supremacy can win in
the heartland. McKibben and Naomi Klein tout the power of direct action
and praise indigenous organizers for catalyzing nonviolent mass
resistance. In the New Yorker, novelist Louise Erdrich suggests that
Standing Rock prevailed because it offered the world an emotionally,
historically, and environmentally compelling story rooted in faith.
"Every time the water protectors showed the fortitude of staying on
message and advancing through prayer and ceremony, they gave the rest of
the world a template for resistance," Erdrich concludes. All of these
analyses are accurate, but their individual and collective explanations
for the Standing Rock victory are insufficient. They fail to ask key
questions about the when, where, how, and who. They do not explain what
made this movement and moment different. And perhaps most importantly,
[in their haste to explain a seemingly improbable and episodic victory,
these writers miss the remarkable big picture]{.underline}. Outflanking
Corporate Globalization [Since the 1970s]{.underline}, unions, public
goods, social welfare, and other essential [building blocks of social
democracy have been beaten back by the free market
consensus]{.underline}. **[Yet over these same decades, indigenous
rights to land, jurisdiction, and sovereignty have gained
ground.]{.underline}** [At the same time workers lost their unions, the
environment was winning a union of its own. That union takes the form of
indigenous rights]{.underline}. Credit for these often-overlooked
indigenous victories belongs to the indigenous movements that
unswervingly pushed for similar goals across decades and even centuries:
return of indigenous lands, restoration of indigenous sovereignties, and
dignity for indigenous peoples. [From the time their lands were seized
in the nineteenth century and even before, indigenous people came
together]{.underline}, forming tribal, intertribal, regional, and
national coalitions and organizations. They [pressured states and
empires built on lands taken from them to recognize their
demands]{.underline}. They stood strong against obstinate and repressive
governments determined to claim their remaining territories and
assimilate their people into the laboring class. **[They remained
resolute.]{.underline}** As the Chiefs of the Syilx, Nlaka'pamux, and
Secwepemc nations wrote in a petition to then--Canadian prime minister
Wilfrid Laurier in 1910: So long as what we consider justice is withheld
from us, so long will dissatisfaction and unrest exist among us, and we
will continue to struggle to better ourselves. For the accomplishment of
this end we and other Indian tribes of this country are now uniting and
we ask the help of yourself and government in this fight for our rights.
In moments of global political and economic crisis like the 1880s,
1930s, 1940s, 1970s, and now 2010s, state policies toward indigenous
people worldwide often shifted. [During the 1880s and 1940s, the United
States applied assimilationist pressure]{.underline} on indigenous
communities, with disastrous consequences. In the 1880s allotment and
privatization policies under the Dawes Act of 1887 splintered indigenous
lands and communities and brought poverty and political, social, and
cultural erosion. In the 1940s, termination policies designed to
eliminate tribes and assimilate Native laborers further devastated
indigenous communities. Children were taken from their families and
placed in abusive residential schools. Workers were displaced from their
homelands and dropped into poverty and homelessness in urban ghettos.
Indigenous people, particularly indigenous women, were subjected to
sexual violence, sterilization, and medical experimentation. **[Yet the
stubborn dream of indigenous resurgence endured]{.underline}**. [And
crises sometimes ushered in marginal progress.]{.underline} In the
1930s, [Franklin Delano Roosevelt's so-called "Indian New
Deal"]{.underline} afforded tribes greater control over their lands and
resources and restored a measure of sovereignty and self-determination.
The 1960s and 70s saw the rise of [the Red Power movement]{.underline},
a momentous breakthrough that pushed the US and Canadian states to adopt
policies based on recognition instead of assimilation. The
contemporaneous [Maori Renaissance]{.underline} in Aotearoa/New Zealand
and [Aboriginal land rights movement in Australia]{.underline} won
similar gains. These movements often found unlikely allies in
neoconservatives, neoliberals, and their predecessors who, beginning in
the 1970s and especially from the 1980s onwards, saw indigenous
self-determination and autonomy as an opportunity to scale back social
welfare spending and reduce indigenous dependence on the government. It
was Richard Nixon who inaugurated the current era of indigenous
self-determination. He outlined his commitment to the policy in a
special message to Congress on July 8, 1970: This, then, must be the
goal of any new national policy toward the Indian people: to strengthen
the Indian's sense of autonomy without threatening his sense of
community. We must assure the Indian that he can assume control of his
own life without being separated involuntarily from the tribal group.
And we must make it clear that Indians can become independent of Federal
control without being cut off from Federal concern and Federal support.
[At times, support from capital-friendly politicians contained and
defanged the revolutionary potential inherent in the restoration of
indigenous lands and sovereignties.]{.underline} [In some instances,
capital interests used self-determination as a facade]{.underline} to
restructure tribes as junior corporate partners in the global political
economy. This occurred at times with Indian gaming, Alaska Native
Corporations, corporate iwi that manage Treaty of Waitangi settlement
money in New Zealand, the Indigenous Land Corporation in Australia, and
First Nations natural resource corporations in Canada. **[More often,
however, indigenous people have coopted conservative forces as agents of
an indigenous agenda.]{.underline}** [Across the world, while other Left
and progressive movements gained little and often lost ground,
indigenous people moved debate and policy in directions favorable to
their interests]{.underline}. **[Self-determination is now the
established framework for indigenous policy]{.underline}** in the United
States, Canada, Australia, and Aotearoa/New Zealand. [It has been firmly
endorsed and furthered through the United Nations Declaration on the
Rights of Indigenous Peoples]{.underline}. In states built upon the
dispossession, marginalization, and attempted elimination of indigenous
people, **[these are remarkable victories]{.underline}**. At Standing
Rock and at proposed pipeline sites across the United States and Canada,
neoliberals have been forced to confront indigenous rights --- a legal
precedent and policy partially of their own creation --- when in a prior
age they would have plowed through these communities without a moment's
hesitation. [Politicians]{.underline} like Nixon [did not anticipate
that indigenous people would, for instance, be able to parlay the minor
restoration of self-governance over expanded acreage in the hinterlands
into a transformative political, economic, and cultural
movement]{.underline}. **[Indigenous people, according to common sense,
could never win]{.underline}**. The future that is now our present would
never happen. **[This condescending assumption turned out to be dead
wrong]{.underline}**. [And it opened up pathways to victory for
indigenous people precisely because they had been
underestimated]{.underline}. Viewed from a decades-long and global view,
indigenous people emerge as cunning, courageous, and even heroic
political tricksters. They took their struggle out onto their lands and
waters and into the courts. [They outsmarted and outflanked politicians
by simultaneously pressuring and cozying up to them]{.underline}. **[In
so doing, they won important and lasting concessions bit by
bit.]{.underline}** [In the long run, these concessions and
relationships have provided indigenous nations with access to government
as well as the political, economic, and legal leverage to deliver
devastating blows to the networks and infrastructure of carbon-dependent
capitalism,]{.underline} which threaten the future of indigenous
communities, lands, and waters and all who share these with them. [This
dynamic revealed itself most vividly under the administration of Barack
Obama]{.underline}, who many Indians adopted and embraced. Obama became
one of the only sitting presidents to visit an Indian reservation when
he journeyed to Standing Rock in 2014. In September 2016, at the Obama
administration's final Tribal Nations Conference, National Congress of
American Indians president Brian Cladoosby honored Obama with a song,
blanket, and traditional cedar hat. At the same time, Standing Rock
marshaled a global indigenous-led coalition, pressuring Obama to halt
the Dakota Access Pipeline. ["Help us stop this pipeline. Stick true to
your words because you said you had our back,"]{.underline} Standing
Rock youth Kendrick Eagle pleaded in a moving message to the president
in November. "I believed in you then, and I still believe in you now
that you can make this happen." [A similar dynamic is unfolding in
Canada]{.underline}, where Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has
promised to renew [a "nation-to-nation" relationship with First
Nations]{.underline}, a position which contradicts his economic agenda
and is forcing him to either backpedal or face a Standing Rock North in
the forces aligned against a proposed Kinder Morgan pipeline.

### 1AR - Perm

#### Political involvement key to back up the momentum of grassroots indigenous movements in order to create institutional change 

**Noisecat, enrolled member of the Canim Lake Band Tsq\'escen in British
Columbia and a graduate of Columbia University and the University of

But indigenous movements used more than cunning and moral suasion. [They
also identified pressure points and exploited them]{.underline}. The
Dakota Access Pipeline, by its very nature, was a vulnerable target.
Trenches cannot be dug where people stand. A pipeline cannot be rerouted
without incurring immense expense. Bakken shale oil costs more to refine
and transport to market than other forms of crude oil. Investors,
bankers, and business partners are risk averse. They don't like delays,
and they don't like bad headlines. OPEC, not American and Canadian oil
barons and politicians, controls the largest share of the global oil
market. In short, if your objective is to shore up the Bakken as a
viable domestic alternative to OPEC, Dakota Access looks like a risky
play. [Now, indigenous operatives and their supporters are pushing
investors to divest.]{.underline} In recent weeks, they've posted [a
conspicuous billboard in Times Square and unfurled a massive banner at
an NFL game, even as they maintain their presence in North
Dakota.]{.underline} While President-elect Trump has threatened to
approve Dakota Access, [divestment, environmental review processes, and
proposed rerouting could end up delivering more partial
victories]{.underline} for Standing Rock in the coming months. **[Had
the Democrats won in November, the movement could have killed Dakota
Access like Keystone XL, delivering a crippling blow to the Bakken oil
barons]{.underline}**. [But to assume Trump's election guarantees the
pipeline will be completed is to again underestimate the indigenous
movement]{.underline}. Indians Make the Best Cowboys At Standing Rock,
Indians settled old scores. They danced inside and outside the lines as
lawyers and outlaws. They took on pipelines and bulldozers where the
tools and trappings of the oil industry were most vulnerable. As capital
and corporate globalization threatened to squelch progress and
conscience, the Indians rode to victory. The water protectors emerged as
heroes. Their enemies became villains. For today, it's victory. For
generations it will be remembered and honored. [For the movements of the
Left, it's a lesson]{.underline}. Beyond well-worn analyses of the power
of action, solidarity, and narrative, **[Standing Rock points to the
necessity to act when and where the networks and infrastructures of
capital are most vulnerable, at the level of individual projects as well
as entire industries and global systems]{.underline}**. [It shows that
movements must remain resolute in their aims --- even if their goals
take decades to achieve. **Politics is a long game.**]{.underline}
Standing Rock also reminds us that resistance is key, but that effective
resistance is strategic. And strategic resistance is even more impactful
when paired with subtle and cunning forms of persuasion. This is
especially essential for Indians, who comprise less than 2 percent of
the population and so must out-strategize and outsmart the powers
aligned against them to win. Lastly, it suggests that [indigenous rights
are potentially revolutionary, and that indigenous sovereignty is an
increasingly powerful instrument against the forces of
capital.]{.underline} When the Justice Department halted construction of
the Dakota Access Pipeline in October, they committed to look into Free
Prior Informed Consent legislation. Such a move would greatly strengthen
the rights and leverage of indigenous nations. [The Left should see
these and other indigenous struggles as its own, incorporating an
indigenous platform into the next generation of radical coalitions and
writing and thinking about indigenous issues alongside more commonly
discussed forms of oppression]{.underline}. [Dark times lie
ahead]{.underline} for the first people of this land and all who share
it with us. President-elect Trump, a former Dakota Access investor, has
threatened to approve the pipeline and others like it. He is lining up
resources to accelerate energy exploitation, devastating the natural
world and pushing the global thermometer higher and higher. Trump's
advisors have called for the privatization of oil, gas, and coal-rich
Indian reservations, mirroring policies like the Dawes Act of 1887 and
the "Termination" policies of the 1940s and 50s, both designed to
destroy tribal communities. **[But the frontier is
turning]{.underline}**. In an unforeseen and previously unimaginable
twist, **[it is the Indians who shepherd forward
progress]{.underline}**. In their right hand, [they clutch a long
history of unrequited struggle for Native Sovereignty]{.underline}.
Among its many chapters is the story of Standing Rock and the rallying
cry heard around the world, "Water is Life!" [With their left hand, they
sow the seeds and point the way forward for the forces of conscience
against capital.]{.underline} In politics, it turns out that Indians
make the best Cowboys.

### 2AC - Schmitt Analysis Bad - Prozorov

#### Their analyses of Schmitt as relating to the state of exception created in emergencies don't take Schmitt's ontological ideas into account.

**Chandler 08 -** (David Chandler, Professor of International Relations
at the University of Westminster in Centre for the Study of Democracy,
"The Revival of Carl Schmitt in International Relations: The Last Refuge
of Critical Theorists?", Published in Millennium: Journal of
International Studies Vol.37 No.1, pp. 27--48 © 2008, Accessed July 18,

Ironically, [while there has been a notable increase in the interest and
use of Schmitt in contemporary IR]{.underline}, the analysis above
suggests that [very little of this work has been focused on how
Schmitt's methodological approach can help us understand the world
today. The critical theorists who have driven the Schmitt 'revival' have
been drawn to Schmitt's descriptive power and have focused on his
contingent descriptions rather than his ontological
framing.]{.underline} Whether Schmitt is portrayed as a universalist or
a particularist, as an advocate of empire or of sovereignty, of
intervention or of non-intervention, [the readings have been based on
selective descriptive appropriations of his work with very little regard
to his underlying ontological focus on the relation between power and
meaning, the legal form and the underlying power-political
content.]{.underline} The superficiality of the readings of Schmitt
within much of critical IR, suggests that [the grounds for the revival
of interest in Schmitt's work should be sought not so much in his
analytical strengths as in the analytical weaknesses of those who seek
to use him. Driven by the 'cultural' and 'normative' turns, many of the
'critical' critics of sovereignty or of the 'socially constructed'
divide between the 'domestic' and the 'international' have been engaged
in a form of critical theorizing which has become increasingly normative
and divorced from any existing progressive or emancipatory
forces]{.underline}. For 'critical cosmopolitans', the normative claim
that the state-based framework of IR needs to be overcome to enable
emancipatory frameworks of external intervention has been increasingly
revealed to be a hollow one, while 'critical post-structuralists' have
equally been thrown on the defensive by the fact that the Cold War
'binary divides' have been deconstructed by ruling elites rather than
challengers to their hegemony. [Normative and abstract frameworks can
often affirm an author's critical approach to the world, in terms of
making a personal ethical statement, but are less likely to stand up as
approaches which provide insight or understanding. As the limits of
these critical critiques become clearer, the articulation of these
positions has often tended to become shrill and desperate as many
critical theorists seek to declare that opposing principles and grand
visions are at stake. Schmitt has been revived to evade confronting the
difficulties of those who seek to ground their radical claims either in
ethical universals or in their deconstruction. In doing so, it is little
surprise that Schmitt's ontology of the relations between sovereign
power, the use of force and international legal order has been pushed
aside. Schmitt, however, cannot provide a refuge for today's critical
theorists. In emptying Schmitt's work of its analytical content they
highlight the exhaustion of their own critical perspectives and the fact
that even a political and legal theorist explicitly hostile to an
emancipatory perspective has more to offer than they do
themselves.]{.underline}

#### Our evidence accounts for theirs -- Prozorov utilizes Schmitt to back claims Schmitt would disagree with due to geopolitics.

[Schmitt becomes reread as a pluralist post-structuralist warning
against the dictatorial hegemonic power of American or global neoliberal
empire]{.underline}.31 The post-structuralist critique of sovereign
power is transferred to a critique of America as the hegemonic sovereign
of the international sphere. Extensions of, and, more often, the
undermining of international legal agreements are seen, therefore, as
sovereign acts of deciding upon the exception and of normalizing the
power of exception.32 [Paradoxically, Schmitt, the founding theorist of
a 'geo-political' framework of international relations, is essentially
conscripted to fight a moral critique of 'power', 'empire' or 'the
liberal project',]{.underline} which is seen as steamrolling over
resistance on the grounds that it is not valid; that those who resist
should be 'eliminated' as 'inhuman' or 'criminal'.33 Schmitt Versus the
Epigones Major problems arise in the use of Schmitt's work by 'critical'
theorists seeking to demarcate their moral critiques of the status quo
as theoretically and substantially grounded in the face of the
moralization of 29. Odysseos, 'Crossing the Line?', 138. 30. Bishai and
Behnke, 'War', 117, 120. 31. [See]{.underline}, for example, Mouffe,

#### Schmitt is not anti-universalism and therefore does not condemn any kind of politico-theological project.

Part of the key to Schmitt's modern appeal is the fact that this past is
redescribed in terms of the problem of America. At the descriptive
level, [European power is often seen as undermined by the universal
claims of American power. It has been at this descriptive level, where
the enemy is demonized as 'inhuman' and war is unlimited because it is
fought under the framework of 'universal liberalism', that most
attention has been focused.]{.underline} The inability of the
Westphalian peace to hold in Europe was a reflection of the social and
economic tensions which could not be contained within the existing
territorial boundaries. As Lenin argued, once the world was divided up,
inter-imperialist rivalry could only take the much more destructive form
of the redivision of the world.40 [What the critical theorists take from
Schmitt is the contingent reading that universalist claims lead to
unlimited war and the transformation of the enemy into a
'criminal'.]{.underline} Many critical post-structuralists read Schmitt
idealistically in this way, without linking his ontological framing of
the context to his specific conclusions. Without these mediations,
Schmitt is read as arguing against universalism per se, as if universal
claims automatically equated with barbarism while claims based on
particularist national interests were somehow more civilized. [This is a
superficial reading of Schmitt's work, focusing on his contingent
conclusions, neglecting the ontological grounding of the relation
between sovereign power and law, which does not itself distinguish
between universal and particular claims in this idealist way. Schmitt is
ill-suited, apart from descriptively, to the essentially descriptive,
critical post-structuralist 'critique' of empire, understood as US
hegemonic sovereignty, equipped with 'decisionist' power and the
normalization of the state of exception. Schmitt's ontological focus
does not lead to a critique of US ethical and legal universal claims on
the basis that they constitute a new US global order, but precisely
because they do not constitute a new global order or nomos.]{.underline}
Schmitt's Nomos is about order based on the realities of power; about
the sovereign content which gives meaning to law as an institution of
territorial ordering. Without a global sovereign, law and the ordering
of (inter-imperialist) power relations must be based on pluralism rather
than universalism. Schmitt's concern is not whether power or
universalism, in themselves, are bad or good but that the separation of
international law from power-political relations is destructive of
order. Like Schmitt's theoretical descendants in the political realist
and English School approaches, Schmitt's concern is order, and therefore
about conflict and its management. He argues that politics is at heart
about conflict (the distinction between 'friend and enemy') and how to
handle it. For Schmitt, the management of conflict becomes easier the
more transparent the relations of power are and the more 'objective' our
understanding of them. His critique of liberal universalism is
materially, objectively, grounded in the fact that there is no political
unity of mankind; there is no world unity and therefore attempts to
achieve such a unity through 'ideological short-circuits' can only
suggest 'fictional unities'.41 His critique of liberalism (both in the
domestic and the international realms) is that it artificially seeks to
abolish conflict without being able to practically contain it.42 Of
course, at some future point conflict might be eliminated: [A world in
which the possibility of war is utterly eliminated, a completely
pacified globe, would be a world without the distinction of friend and
enemy and hence a world without politics]{.underline} ... For the
definition of the political, [it is]{.underline} here even [irrelevant
whether such a world without politics is desirable as an ideal
situation]{.underline}.43 However, [in a world where states exist as
autonomous political subjects]{.underline} (i.e. where more than one
state exists) [there is always the possibility of conflict and of war.
In which case, any claim to represent the 'interests of humanity' could
only be an ideal, contingent, one, that would be dependent on there not
being a disagreement; that is, on there not being the politics of friend
and enemy. Once politics returns, 'humanity' disappears]{.underline}; by
definition: 'Humanity is not a political concept.'44

### 2AC - Schmitt Nazi

#### The enemy in Schmitt's philosophy is a product of his antisemitism, meaning their "pluralism" actually morphs into an ideology comparable to Nazism.

**Gross 07** -- (Raphael Gross, director of the Leo Baeck Institute in
London, director of the Jewish Museum in Frankfurt, and reader in
history at the University of Sussex, "Carl Schmitt and the Jews",
Published by The University of Wisconsin Press in July 2007, Transcribed
July 18, 2019, njt)

Conclusion

Schmitt\'s project of constructing a specifically German legal theory
failed. It had to fail because [legal theory cannot be grounded in
particularity. The legitimacy of every modern form of such theory lies
precisely in its claim to universality.]{.underline} This is the case
even if a legal order is always limited to a specific group of persons.
For this reason, [all legal theory has to be "positivistic" and
"abstract" in one or another manner. Schmitt was aiming directly at this
universality with his antipositivist, allegedly concrete doctrine, which
he sometimes called "German" but that was always meant as
antisemitic.]{.underline}

[Antisemitism and Nazism stamped Schmitt's thinking in a basic way. The
underlying point of reference for his analyses was the
"intellectual-historical situation."]{.underline} But his engagement did
not only involve theoretical debates. It also involved, concretely, the
Nazi state's university politics. [Schmitt's antisemitic and Nazi
engagement]{.underline} was by no means simply the result of his
career-related openness to seduction. Rather, it [was the apogee of a
historical reconstructable development carried forward by specific
conceptual streams. His antisemitism was as little haphazard or
coincidental as the antisemitism of German Nazism itself.]{.underline}
It is the case that in 1933, in face of the new state's obscene
brutality, Schmitt could have decided otherwise. But this is not
relevant to consideration of the substance of his work. He was not only
preoccupied with "Jewish" thinking in the Nazi state's first years. The
anonymously published early writing, marked by cultural pessimism,
already contains anti-Jewish comments, and the posthumously published
Glossarium is charged with hatred of Judaism and the Jews.

Schmitt's battle against positivism was not only widely approved in both
the Weimar Republic and Nazi State. At present in Europe and North
America, many efforts are evident in the academic fields of legal
studies, political science, history, and literary studies to make his
ideas fruitful by simply excising their openly racist and antisemitic
dimension. [One of the main arguments of the present work has been that
such excision is not possible without concentrating on some banal, or at
least commonplace, insights that in any case do not represent the core
of his work. That work achieves its unity through ideas that take up
anti-emancipatory and secularized anti-Jewish theological motifs of
Catholic and Protestant origin]{.underline}. When Schmitt's work is
studied in terms of the history of ideas, then the similarity of its
various phases becomes foregrounded. [The question of his attitude
toward "the Jewish" can in fact never be excised, since his most
important ideas originally crystallized in the historical debates of the
Catholic counterrevolution and among the Young Hegelians opposed to
Jewish emancipation. For this reason the question of the significance of
the Jews and "the Jewish" had defining importance for Schmitt's work as
a whole.]{.underline} As his ideas developed, his response to this
question became increasingly foundational for his legal theory.

[Political theology in Schmitt's sense is the effort to transmit and
instrumentalize theological concepts for the sake of founding a radical
doctrine of constitutional law. From theology, only the enemy is here
taken over. The enemy's archetype is the Jew. The "substance" of
anti-positivist, antinormativist, "concrete order" -- based thinking can
only be found in Aryanism which itself can be defined only in terms of
not being Jewish. "The Jewish" is composed of diverse images of the
enemy that formed in Germany and France in the course of the nineteenth
century]{.underline}. It incorporated, in the first place, the
Catholic-atheistic, anti-universalistic antisemitism represented by
Maurras in France; in the second place, the Protestant-atheistic,
antiparticularistic antisemitism especially championed in Germany by
Schmitt's paragon Bruno Bauer; and, in the third place, a widespread
nineteenth- and twentieth-century German Catholic hostility to
assimilated Jews, not on the religious-theological grounds but as
catalysts of modernity. This third stratum of Schmitt's enmity strongly

### Friend/enemy wrong

#### Their 'single villain ideology' is foolish: cherry-picks data, is careless about causation, and ignores history

There is no single villain On my page against libertarianism, I
mentioned that single-villain ideologies are always trouble: The
advantage of single-villain ideologies is obvious: in any given
situation you never have to think hard to find out the culprit. The
disadvantages, however, are worse: you can\'t see your primary target
clearly--- hatred is a pair of dark glasses--- and you can\'t see the
problems with anything else. [The world is always obviously messed up.
Single-villain ideologies attribute this to one cause**: government**,
or capitalism, or communism, or liberalism, or **religion**, or
irreligion, or white people, or non-white people. You can always make a
case for these villains, because they\'re large things with millions of
people involved, and many of them have done bad things. But it\'s
foolish, because villainy is everywhere. No group of people, no
political party, no belief system is immune.]{.underline} And
[if]{.underline}, God forbid[, you had a revolution and had the power to
exterminate your favorite villains, you\'d soon discover that human
misery remained, and indeed increased]{.underline}. If someone reads the
news and everything confirms his opinion that his favorite villains are
truly bad and insane\... he doesn\'t have an insight into the world, he
has mental blinders on. He\'s simply **[cherry-picking the data, or
being careless about causation.]{.underline}** Some habits that can help
insulate against this sort of thinking: Wide experience. If you\'re
looking at some bad thing\... how did it play out 100 or 200 years ago?
How does it go in the US, Europe, China, Latin America? A lot of common
political opinions turn out to be very parochial, temporally and
spatially. **[Check your theory against how political power actually
operates.]{.underline}** I\'ve heard both conservative and radical-left
conspiracy theories that fail to recognize the simple fact that the US
Congress is controlled by the Right. (The conservatives were sure that
feminists somehow can get any law passed; the leftists were convinced
that Obama could somehow pass laws without the House.) [If your villain
is "capitalism" or "liberalism", check the past before they existed, and
see if it was really so great.]{.underline} In the present, consider
neutral causes before assigning it to your enemies. Look for the
counter-error. [You may be righteously opposed to some political course
of action; that doesn\'t mean that any alternative to it is
good.]{.underline} The opposite of a bad policy is often also a bad
policy. Sometimes there are villains, but also deeper structural
problems. On inequality, for instance, Reagan and his followers made
everything worse. But things are getting worse in Europe too. See
Piketty for another look at why the postwar decaders were better for
everyone and why just keeping the right out of power isn\'t enough.

### 2AC - Human Security Good - TL

#### Human security is good and not innately a cover for intervention.

In what follows I emphasise the security dimension - the need to
overcome the legacies of the past and adapt our institutions to the
global present. [There is a need to move away from nationalist and bloc
thinking that permeates our institutions towards a concept of human
security - the concept that expresses what came out of the Helsinki
agreement]{.underline}. This means not only changing our thinking but
dismantling the security institutions of the past that sustain current
authoritarian regimes and creating new institutions that are better
adapted to a globalised situation. Of course we need security
institutions but they have to be very different - this is why I propose
to apply the concept of human security. Human security has three
dimensions. First of all, human security is about the security of
individuals and the communities in which they live. This is the third
basket of Helsinki - the human dimension. [By emphasising the security
of individuals rather than states, human security implies a commitment
to human rights but it does not deny the importance of the more
traditional state centred threats]{.underline}. Indeed, the threat, for
example, of an attack by an enemy state can also be described as a
humanitarian threat. Second[, human security is about the
interrelationship between freedom from fear and freedom from want and
about physical as well as material insecurity]{.underline}. This is the
second basket of Helsinki; the emphasis on economic, scientific and
cultural co-operation[. It means that human rights do not just cover
political and civil rights but economic and social and cultural rights
too]{.underline}. Thirdly, [human security implies an extension of
rule-governed security as op- posed to war-based security. It implies
that relations between states are governed by a law paradigm rather than
a war paradigm. It is about the non-use of force in relations between
states and the extension of law-governed security to the whole
Euro-Atlantic area]{.underline} - the first basket of Helsinki. Or to
put it another way, it is about the blurring of the internal and the
external. We are used to thinking of internal security as the domain of
law and policing and external security as war and diplomacy. A human
security approach implies that something like what we take for granted
internally has to apply externally as well. The term \'human security\'
has been widely used and it has been criticised for meaning whatever
anyone wants it to mean. [For some,]{.underline} the term is too
\'soft\'. It treats economic and social development as security issues
and neglects the real dangers people face in the context of political
and criminal violence. If we tie the term to the Helsinki baskets, then
it has to have a hard dimension. It has to be about protecting people
from foreign military aggression, genocide, ethnic cleansing, sectarian
warfare, terrorism, violent crime, or other human rights violations as
well as from extreme poverty or disease. For others, the problem is the
opposite. [It is a way the great powers legitimate the use of military
force]{.underline}. NATO justified the war over Kosovo in 1999 in terms
of humanitarian intervention and the Russian foreign minister, Sergei
Lavrov, used the term \'human security\' to justify the invasion of
Georgia in August 2008. [Neither the Kosovo war nor the Georgian war can
be described as human security. Whatever the goals, the means did not
conform to human security. In other words, human security is a means as
well as a goal.]{.underline} It may involve the use of force and thus
can be regarded as a hard security policy but the use of force has to be
directed towards protection rather than fighting or revenge. It means
using the military in a different way, more like policing than war
fighting. To put hu- man security into practice we need something like
global emergency forces - po- lice, health services, fire fighters, etc.
These forces would also include the military but [the aim would be to
dampen down violence and to protect civilians not to fight
enemies]{.underline}. Let me give two examples. One is about how
thinking could change our actions. The attack on New York on September 1
1 200 1 was treated as an attack by a foreign enemy on the United
States; it was compared to Pearl Harbor in 1941 and justified what was
described as pre-emptive defence against Iraq and Afghanistan. Suppose
it had been described as a \'crime against humanity?\' That would have
re- quired a global police effort to capture the perpetrators and bring
them to justice instead. [The]{.underline} second [example is the
current intervention in Libya and is about how we need institutions to
implement human security]{.underline}. Like Kosovo, the goal of the
intervention in Libya is to protect civilians - a human security goal.
But [the means are the classic instruments of war - air strikes. It is
very difficult to protect civilians from the air. The danger of air
strikes is that people get killed, mainly soldiers but also the very
people you are supposed to protect; already rebels and some civilians
have been killed by mistake.]{.underline} Air strikes are also very
polarising, increasing the cohesion of Gadhafi supporters behind an
anti-imperialist rhetoric. At best they will help the rebels win but
leaving a legacy of bitter division. At worst the stalemate between the
rebels and Gadhafi will degenerate into the kind of new war that we have
witnessed in Africa, Iraq or Afghanistan. [From a human security
perspective, the appropriate course of action would have been to protect
civilians throughout Libya and guarantee their right to peaceful
protest.]{.underline} In the end, the prospects for democracy depend on
the extent to which the rebels can mobilise politically; thus the aim of
any human security approach is to dampen down violence and not support
one side or another militarily.

Human security: an alternative approach to peacebuilding? [International
peace building has demonstrated a range of problems and
controversies]{.underline}. In particular, [the effectiveness and
appropriateness of promoting liberal democracy and market economics in
volatile conflict-prone societies are contested]{.underline}. The
perceived absence of 'local ownership', and insufficient consultation
with local stakeholders, have led some observers to question the
legitimacy of peace-building operations. [The apparent emphasis in
international peace building on top-down mediation among power brokers
and building state institutions---in contrast to more bottom-up,
community-driven peace building---has raised concerns about the
sustainability of peace building projects]{.underline}. The attention to
reconstruction and stability and the neglect of the underlying sources
of conflict suggest, to some, that the nature of the 'peace' that is
being built is not entirely inclusive. [The seeming paradox of combining
reconstruction with coercion---most obviously in Afghanistan and Iraq,
but also more subtly in Bosnia and elsewhere---and the manner in which
other components of the peace-building agenda also appear to be in
tension with each other suggest that there are deep and unresolved
internal contradictions in the peace-building project.]{.underline} In
particular, the concept of liberal peace building and the manner in
which it is promoted in fragile and divided societies are problematic.
[The tenets of liberal peace building---liberal democracy, liberal human
rights, market values, the integration of societies into globalisation
and the centralised secular state---are not necessarily
universal]{.underline} (or universally applicable) values. Moreover, the
liberal peace and its neoliberal economic dimensions, which have
displaced older liberal ideas about welfare, are not necessarily
appropriate for conflicted or divided societies. Indeed, democracy and
the market are arguably adversarial or even conflictual forces---taken
for granted in stable Western democracies but not necessarily suitable
for volatile societies that do not enjoy stable institutions.
Peace-building activities are thus not neutral in their normative
orientation or impact, and this raises important questions regarding
policy options. There is real concern that 'post-conflict'
peace-building programmes may therefore sow the seeds of their own
failure by exacerbating the social tensions that resulted in violent
conflict in the first place, or by failing to create the domestic
foundations for democratising and marketising reforms. As a result,
different components of the liberal reform agenda may be in tension with
each other in ways that cast doubt on the viability of the larger
liberal peace-building project. A human security approach to peace
building can offer some solutions. [Human security suggests that public
policy must be directed above all at enhancing the personal security,
welfare and dignity of individuals and communities.]{.underline} The
human security concept is in itself theoretically controversial.45 All
approaches to human security agree that the referent of security policy
and analysis should be the individual, but they disagree about which
threats the individual should be protected from, and what means should
be employed to achieve this protection. The theoretical human security
debate is thus embroiled in disagreements about the scope of the
concept. Nevertheless, despite these theoretical controversies, [the
fundamental claim of human security is compelling and applicable in many
different policy areas: the irreducible referent object of security
should be individuals, rather than constructions such as territorial
integrity, national security, or state sovereignty. This is not to
presume that human security is necessarily in conflict with state
security; the state remains the central provider of security in ideal
circumstances. Human security does, however, suggest that international
security traditionally defined---as territorial integrity---does not
necessarily correlate with human security, and that an over-emphasis
upon state security can be to the detriment of human welfare needs. So
traditional conceptions of state security are a necessary but not
sufficient condition of human welfare]{.underline}. The citizens of
states that are 'secure' according to the traditional concept of
security can be personally perilously insecure to a degree that demands
a reappraisal of the concept of security. [The concept of human security
can be critically applied to a range of policy areas in order to
deconstruct existing structures and institutions of power, gender and
distribution]{.underline}. This raises questions about existing policy
assumptions and priorities, and the interests they serve. A critical
approach to human security leads us to question and, if necessary,
challenge existing constructions such as state sovereignty, 'high
politics', national interest and the market. Critical approaches
question or challenge prevailing structures of power and power
relations, and also prevailing discourses or ways of thinking. Human
security encourages us to interrogate and problematise the values and
institutions which currently exist as they relate to human welfare, and
more thoroughly question the interests that are served by these
institutions. For example, poverty alleviation and employment generation
efforts by international financial institutions may help to lift
communities out of poverty, but this must be seen within the broader
liberal market context which (according to some analysts) arguably
disempowers communities and results in social deprivation. The human
security concept clearly also has implications for the activities that
are undertaken in international peace-building programmes, and the
nature of engagement between international and 'local' actors. In
general terms, [a human security approach to peace building would strive
to enhance the physical and material security of individuals and
communities, through poverty alleviation, employment creation, and
public service delivery, in the belief that this will ultimately serve
the cause of peace and stability]{.underline}. The human security
approach would suggest that the individual and communities, rather than
aggregate indicators of growth or performance, should be the primary
beneficiaries. The human security approach to peace building rests upon
the belief that post-conflict societies are more likely to embrace
peace, and perhaps reconciliation, and eschew sectarian politics if they
are materially secure and if citizens believe that they have a stake in
society and have real prospects. From a human security perspective the
prevailing liberal institutionalist peace-building consensus does not
give adequate attention to human welfare as a priority, or else has
undue confidence in the market and liberal democracy to deliver human
security goals. In this sense the human security and the liberal
approaches to peace building basically agree upon the end point, but
differ on how to get there. The liberal approach to peace building is
mainly oriented around aggregate indicators of development, which can
obscure very serious problems, while the human security perspective
suggests that the experience of individuals is critically important. A
human security approach to peace building also places emphasis on
addressing the underlying sources of conflict, rather than merely
containing conflict through a negative peace. If operationalised, these
ideas could potentially strengthen the legitimacy of peace-building
activities, make them more sensitive to local needs and conditions, and
therefore strengthen local buy-in and support while restoring dignity to
post-crisis societies. A number of implications arise from the human
security concept. The human security approach recognises the root causes
of conflicts in terms of social and political exclusion, horizontal
inequalities or structural violence, in addition to power politics and
spoiler activities. This recognition therefore requires root cause
analysis, preventive action, early warning indicators and strategic
planning, taking the exercise of peace building beyond a quick impact
project with short-term goals. The human security approach does not rely
on preconceived benchmarks relating to state institutions, democracy or
the market as the end goals, but rather as means for protecting and
providing for citizens. This is a marked departure from the liberal
institutionalist approach, which takes externally driven visions of
security, the market and the state as benchmarks. From a human security
perspective a weak state is one which cannot exercise its primary
function of social protection and therefore fails in its duty to
protect, care for and empower its citizens.46 A 'failed state' therefore
is one that cannot provide for the needs of its citizens, rather than
one which cannot maintain institutions of liberal governance and markets
or one that threatens international security. [The legitimacy of state
institutions is thus a function of the state\'s willingness and ability
to distribute justice, meet human needs, and undertake public service
delivery]{.underline}. Institutions are fundamentally important, but
they are not ends in themselves, but rather the means to an end: to
enhance the welfare and livelihoods of individuals and communities.
Finally, [while the human security concept places individuals and
communities as the referent of policy and analysis, it also seeks to
endow individuals with the agency required to bring about positive
change in their lives]{.underline}. International assistance may be
necessary in post-conflict and conflict-prone societies, and this always
raises sensitive questions related to the balance between international
and local control of the peace-building agenda. In these circumstances,
local 'ownership' will be compromised, since the relationship between
local and international actors is rarely, if ever, equal. Nevertheless[,
a human security approach,]{.underline} while acknowledging this
reality, [strives]{.underline} as far as possible to facilitate the
empowerment of communities, and [to facilitate conditions that allow
responsibility to be brought directly to local actors. The human
security approach therefore provides a number of critical answers for
addressing the performance and legitimacy problems of peace
building]{.underline}. The more populations and their perceptions of the
common good are included, the more difficult it is to simply impose
particular ideals, values or models deemed universally applicable but
proven problematic in local contexts. However, this does not mean a mere
adherence to the principles of participation or local ownership to
improve the success of reforms or to prevent inertia or a hostile local
response. Perceptions count because those who are directly suffering in
crisis situations have a moral right to freedom from their suffering.
This approach to peace building builds upon and is sensitive
to---without 'romanticising'---indigenous institutions. A critical
assessment of peace building, from the human security point of view,
also brings a number of problem-solving, practical approaches: when
individuals and communities, instead of institutions, are put at the
centre of analysis, there are implications for the assessment, planning,
implementation and evaluation of peace-building initiatives. All these
require in-depth knowledge of the situation and context-specific
solutions, instead of adherence to external models. Providing for
security and stability may remain as a priority. However, the human
security approach also recognises that meeting welfare goals, such as
immediate basic needs and public service delivery, job security,
employment and poverty alleviation, as well as addressing grievances, is
absolutely essential. A failure to do so, and the alienation and
exclusion that results from this, threatens both the legitimacy and
effectiveness of peace-building efforts. The question of sequencing and
prioritisation, therefore, is not whether security comes first but how
security is provided and what the expanded notion of security really
means in everyday lives. Similarly, it also suggests that peace-building
must go beyond material factors, such as economic growth, and address
social relations, and in particular restore or build trust within a
broader context of inclusive development and social integration. Peace
building is fundamentally about social and interpersonal relations.47
Because conflicts erode trust, the need to support reconciliation and
coexistence cannot be ignored. A human security approach to peace
building implies a process of 'trustbuilding': trust and confidence in
peaceful community relations, and in the national project.

### Human Security Good - Disasters

#### Human Security is key to building resilience against natural disasters

**Jimba et al 11 (**Masamine JIMBA, Susan HUBBARD, Eriko SASE, Tomoko
SUZUKI, Keiko OTSUKA. "Human Security Approaches for Disaster Recovery
and Resilience", International Medical Community, 3/11/11, Accessed

Disasters have never stopped. In particular, natural disasters, such as
earthquakes, ﬂoods, landslides, and extreme weather conditions, continue
to cause death in many parts of the world. According to the Centre for
Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED), a total of 385
[natural disasters resulted in approximately 300,000 deaths worldwide
and caused more than US\$120 billion of economic damages]{.underline} in
2010 alone.1 In 2011, this wave did not change. Largescale earthquakes
have hit Japan, Turkey and Peru.The largest one with the magnitude 9.0
took place in northeastern Japan on 11 March, and caused a tsunami and
nuclear power plant disaster. Reportedly, it killed approximately 16,000
people and 4,000 are still missing as of 26 October 2011. Although it
took place in northeastern Japan, it has had signiﬁcant economic and
psychological impact on the whole of Japan and 71,358 evacuees are still
spread across all 47 prefectures.2 Moreover[, it was responsible for
major supply chain interruptions around the world in the early weeks
following the disaster]{.underline}. This massive disaster has inﬂuenced
other countries, in particular in their decisions whether to keep
existing or build new nuclear power plants. In other words, its inﬂuence
has gone beyond Japan's national borders. [When such disasters take
place, existing incountry systems are generally not fully prepared to
protect people's physical and psychological wellbeing within the
country's borders, exposing them to other, less direct threats,
including physical and mental health challenges.]{.underline} During the
immediate post-disaster stage, community empowerment is also a hard task
and often postponed in the interest of getting assistance to those who
need it as quickly as possible. [External assistance]{.underline} often
comes into the country to complement domestic responses. While external
assistance is critical because domestic actors are generally not able to
deal with the magnitude of suffering on their own, it [can have the
effect of further alienating those who are being helped and further
contribute to their sense of helplessness]{.underline}. Therefore, as
immediate needs are being met through emergency, humanitarian support,
it is important to remember that such responses may not be enough. A
more comprehensive and longer-term approach that focuses on community
empowerment and building community resilience to multiple indirect
threats even during the chaotic post-disaster period---in other words a
[human security approach]{.underline}---[has the potential to overcome
such threats to individuals and communities]{.underline}. Evolution of
Human Security Concept The concept of "human security" is characterized
by an emphasis on the security of individuals and communities that has
moved beyond traditional national security, with the ultimate goal of
the latter being the security of national borders. The concept has
evolved since the UNDP ﬁrst began to popularize the term in the 1994
Human Development Report, which described seven categories of security:
economic, food, health, environmental, personal, community, and
political.3 Almost a decade later, The Commission on Human Security went
on to say that [human security should focus on addressing "critical and
pervasive threats" to the "vital core of all human lives]{.underline}"
and added the freedom to live in dignity to the UNDP's dual freedoms
from fear and from want.4 The Commission on Human Security also deﬁned
the importance of ﬁve elements of human security : (1) it is
people-centered; (2) it is integrated with human development and human
rights; (3) it deals with a comprehensive set of threats; (4) it engages
actors beyond the government; and (5) it proposes a bi-modal strategy of
protection from above and empowerment from below.4 In the early years of
discussion of human security within the UN, lines were often blurred
between human security and the concept of the responsibility to protect
(R2P), which led some countries to perceive human security as a
justiﬁcation for intervention. The UN secretary general's 2010 report on
human security5 draws a clear distinction between these two concepts.
While R2P is similar to human security in that its focus is on
protecting people rather than protecting national borders, it deals
primarily with violent threats, thereby focusing on the freedom from
fear and excluding the other two freedoms. In addition, R2P still
requires state-based and supranational responses. In contrast, human
security engages multiple stakeholders, from individuals and their
families to NGOs, to all levels of government, to the international
community. Human security also can be more effective at dealing with
many of the key challenges facing the world today, particularly those
relating to health, because of its reliance on community empowerment and
engagement as the mechanism for ensuring security and its focus on
building resilience to multiple interconnected threats. Resilience in
Human Security Although use of the concept of resilience is becoming
more common and is increasingly used in academic studies, in this
article, we simply follow the dictionary deﬁnition: an ability to
recover from or adjust easily to misfortune or change. With this, [the
importance of building resilience in human security was once emphasized
by focusing on HIV/AIDS in Asia and Africa]{.underline}.6 [During and
after emergencies and disasters, 'building resilience' can be far more
important as these events affect both human and material resources. We
cannot prevent all new threats resulting from emergencies or disasters
from happening, so our focus should be on building communities'
resilience to such existing and potential threats so that the negative
impact on their lives, livelihoods, and dignity is reduced.]{.underline}
At a more practical level, we can observe that some countries and
communities are able to successfully limit death tolls and human
suffering caused by natural disasters and other crises while
others---even those with very similar socio-economic and geographic
conditions---are not. Why are those places more resilient to disasters?
One explanation is that areas that have been more successful are those
whose communities are already mobilized and engaged in their own
protection. Action for Resilience in Haiti: The experience of a health
NGO The activities of the Haitian Group for the Study of Kaposi's
Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections (GHESKIO), a Haitian health NGO,
demonstrated that their [efforts to create a resilient HIV/AIDS service
system in Haiti indeed were very effective in coping with the earthquake
disaster]{.underline} in early 2010.7--9 In this sense, having at least
one local organization that has gained the trust of a community in
dealing with one threat and empowered that community with a focus on
building their "resilience to a particular threat" is crucial for human
security. While GHESKIO's primary focus since its founding in 1982 has
been dealing with AIDS and opportunistic infections, it already had
strong connections with the local community (and is made up almost
entirely of Haitians). This meant that it understood the needs in the
community as well as the opportunities for mobilization through local,
national, regional, and international collaborations.10 Furthermore,
very importantly, it had the trust of the communities in Port-au-Prince
that were most in need of health services after the devastating
earthquake on 12 January. Since people knew and trusted GHESKIO, they
came to the organization, not only for health services but also for
food, water, and shelter, and GHESKIO was able to leverage its community
orientation to link those in need with those who were coming from
outside to provide various forms of support. Action for Resilience in
Japan: The experience of school children Everyone has the potential to
build resilience to the threats they face, even the most vulnerable
populations. During and after the 3.11 disaster in Japan, children took
action to protect themselves and others from the tsunami. While many
adults were irresolute about evacuation after the earthquake, many
children evacuated to higher ground just after the tremor, faithfully
following what they had learned in school. Even though about 60% of the
school children lost some of their family members in Kamaishi city,
almost 100% of them survived and many of them helped younger children
and elderly to evacuate.11 School children also took action to overcome
the emotional impact of the massive loss of lives and property. After a
week living in a shelter---a school gymnasium---a seven years old girl
started to publish a unique newspaper.12 Her idea was "I want to cheer
everybody in the shelter up, because people seems to be discouraged
here." Different from the real newspapers ﬁlled with serious sad
stories, she decided to pick up only happy stories and published as a
daily wall newspaper named "Fight" with the new friends she had made in
the shelter. In the ﬁrst issue, the children wrote, "You (adults) are
now living in unfavorable circumstances but let's ﬁght for future! We
will also do our best." They vividly expressed their joy in daily life
in the shelter, such as reporting that a volunteer team from Osaka made
a hot poke miso-soup that was very tasty, everybody got wonderful
doughnuts for snack, and they had found pretty tulips blooming, etc. The
children continued to publish 50 issues until 3 July when most of the
people moved to temporary housing. The girl who started the wall
newspaper says "Because the people who read the newspaper talked to me
with a smile, I was also encouraged." Conclusion The above two stories
do not explain the whole aspect of human security, but
[they]{.underline} do start to [demonstrate the importance of the
elements of human security outlined above in building physical and
emotional resilience in the face of natural disasters.]{.underline} The
critical importance of one often overlooked element---being
people-centered---is illustrated by activities to build resilience in
Haiti and Japan . [In human security discourse 'peoplecentered' usually
refers to 'the more vulnerable' people]{.underline}. In Haiti, a local
NGO that had been so vulnerable in its early years that it could not
even name the disease it was ﬁghting against--- HIV/AIDS---had gained
the power and the conﬁdence of the government and the community through
its efforts to deal with HIV/AIDS, and this experience allowed them to
ﬁght against a new threat when disaster struck. In Japan, seemingly
helpless school children under 10 years old mobilized to encourage
people living in a shelter with almost no cost. They are the people who
are aware of the value of human security, though they may not know much
about three freedoms: freedom from fear and want and to live in dignity.
The existence of such people with high level of conscientization (or
critical consciousness), as advocated by Paulo Freire, drove them to
motivate people around them to create resilient communities. We do not
know if such people can be trained or if it is a gift people are born
with. However, where it exists, empowerment starts, and once it starts,
it must be protected by the government and global society. As a previous
study recommends,6 integration of empowerment and protection is a key
pathway to achieving human security. To know more about the dynamics of
the empowerment-protection synergy, we need to undertake more case
studies in different settings.

Disasters are a threat to human security, as they cause many deaths and
the destruction of livelihoods and assets[. Over the last decade, over
700 thousand people globally lost their lives, over 1.4 million were
injured, and approximately 23 million were made homeless as a result of
disasters.]{.underline} Overall, more than 1.5 billion people were
affected by disasters in various ways. The total economic loss was more
than \$1.3 trillion. Women, children, persons with disabilities and the
elderly are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of
disasters. Worse, disaster impacts on human security goes far beyond the
immediate effects, as disasters are often linked to health issues and
pandemics, social and political unrest, displacement and migration and
long term destabilization of economic growth and prosperity, thus
affecting threats across the seven identified areas within the human
security approach. Especially the most vulnerable lack the ability to
recover quickly from disasters, and in many least developed countries
development gains are lost for decades, directly impacting the human
security of the affected communities. The [Human Security]{.underline}
**approach** is the result of the widening and deepening of security as
a response to changes in the international landscape characterized by
the increased interdependence and interrelatedness of nations and
individuals. It was first introduced to the UN system through UNDP's
1994 Human Development Report. The main aim of the application of human
security is to shift the traditional notion that security is a state
centred issue, and refocus the notion of security on the individual.
This extension [increases the range of actors involved to include
regional and international organization]{.underline}, NGOs and civil
society, and does not just focus on only protecting individuals, [it
also aims to empower people to fend for themselves]{.underline}. In
2015, we are now security issues transcend national borders, and issues
that threaten human security, including climate-related hazards and
natural disasters which act as threat-multipliers. In order to better
reduce the vulnerability of individuals and communities, it is essential
that these risk/threats are identified and reduced at the community
level. The importance and effectiveness of **the five underlying
principles of the human security** concept has recently been
acknowledged in Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030.
UNISDR is taking the 'new', innovative approach of integrating the human
security concept into risk reduction forward in 2015 and beyond. [With
the overall goal of increased resilience through enhancing disaster risk
reduction and prevention worldwide, the Sendai Framework calls for a
people-centred and community-based approach as it recognizes the need
and existing gap of the involvement of and focus on communities and
community groups, in particularly from the most vulnerable, as a crucial
element to ensure their safety and security]{.underline}, the Sendai
Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 has an expanded scope as
it includes man-made disasters and prominently features human losses as
a key priority. For example, the new framework includes several
references to the aim of the enhancing human security, including the
goal of 'the substantial reduction of disaster risk and losses in lives,
livelihoods and health and in the economic, physical, social, cultural,
environmental assets of persons, businesses, communities and countries'
and '(M)anaging the risk of disasters is aimed at protecting persons and
their property, health, livelihoods and productive assets, as well as
cultural and environmental assets'. [The implementation at the local and
urban level has been identified as a crucial breaking point for enhanced
resilience and human security.]{.underline} The Sendai Framework also
calls for a **comprehensive** approach to building resilient and
security of people, including ensuring a comprehensive involvement of
all affected, as well as comprehensive risk assessment evaluating all
potential risks to an individual, a community, or a state. It
acknowledges the need for a **context-specific** approach to disaster
risk reduction and resilience, as there is no one-size-fits all approach
to security and resilience. For example, it states that 'The reduction
of disaster risk is a common concern for all States and the extent to
which developing countries are able to effectively enhance and implement
national disaster risk reduction policies and measures in the context of
their respective circumstances and capabilities... ' (19(a)), and
'understand the economic, social, health, education, environmental and
cultural heritage impacts, as appropriate, in the context of
event-specific hazard-exposure and vulnerability information' (24(d).'
**Protection and empowerment** of specifically the poorest and most
vulnerable, including women, children, elderly people, people living
with disabilities, but also of local authorities and local communities
(5, 7, 19(e ), 32, 33 (m), 36, 48 (i)) Sendai Framework), is one of the
key aspects of the Sendai Framework. Thus, the application of the five
principles of human security approach not only adds immense value to the
Sendai Framework, but their application will contribute, respectively be
imperative for the successful realisation and achievement of the
Framework's goals and its application at the country-level. **Urban
areas** have been identified as breeding grounds for disaster,
environmental, social, economic and human risks and insecurities. For
example, the 2011 World Urbanisation Prospects highlighted that
approximately 890 million people were living in areas of high risk of
exposure. Flooding is the most frequent and greatest hazard that affects
cities or urban agglomerations; at least 250 cities are located in or
are close to areas that with high risk of flooding -- potentially
affecting 663 million inhabitants. The Global Assessment Report on
Disaster Risk Reduction 2009noted that poor urban governance drives
urban risks. For example, safe land is in short supply driven by growing
informal settlements, slums, and squatters, which in turn have limited
infrastructure and services exacerbating human security risks. Cities'
commercial, industrial and residential locations prove to be livelihood
centre for urban poor, who left with no choice but to settle on
dangerous locations subject to natural or man-made hazards. The trend is
further increased in countries or regions with instable political and
social circumstances, leading to increasing and often uncontrolled
migration and displacement of people, in particularly in and from urban
areas. The IPCC in 2012 noted that in the next few decades, a major
driver of the increasing economic damages and losses from disasters will
be the increasing concentration of people and assets in hazardous
locations, especially in urban areas. The IPCC stressed that lack of
data on disasters and disaster risk reduction at the local level as a
constraint that effects improvements in local vulnerability reduction.
The proposed project will a) adapt existing tools and mechanisms to the
new direction integrating the human security idea given by the post-2015
framework, b) implement the Sendai Framework directly at the local
community level, including through the new and innovative partnerships,
with the aim of enhancing community resilience and human security. Based
on existing human security and disaster risks, intensive gap analysis
and commitment from Governments and partners, this project focuses on
building resilience and human security in up to 5 cities and
municipalities in Tunisia. Making use of not only the strong commitment
by national and local Governments to reduce disaster risk and enhance
human security, but also the existing regional network and support
currently building in the Arab region, it is suggested to also extend
and implement activities in up to 5 municipalities in Mauritania, which
does not yet have any intervention to enhance human security. The
project aims to help protect urban communities living in vulnerable
conditions and to develop capacities of the local institutions to
overcome disaster, health, food, environmental and economic
insecurities, and thus enhance human security of the vulnerable**.**
[The Arab States region as a whole is exposed to geological and
hydro-meteorological hazards]{.underline} (earthquakes, landslides,
drought, sand storms, floods, and snow storms, extreme events in
temperatures, forest fires, and cyclones). [These hazards are coupled
with rapid urbanization, environmental degradation, water scarcity,
changing demographics, displacement and migration, disease outbreaks,
pandemic influenza and poverty, which combined pose a real threat to
human security. Combined with the conflict and turmoil in many
countries, the Arab region presents multifaceted challenges on a larger
scale than ever before.]{.underline} This is demonstrated by the fact
that while the absolute number of disasters worldwide has almost doubled
since 1980, the average of natural hazards has almost tripled during the
same period in the Arab region. Statistics show that during the past 30
years, the Arab region was affected by more than 270 disasters,
resulting in more than 150,000 deaths and affecting approximately 10
million people. The UNISDR 2011 Global Assessment Report on Disaster
Risk Reduction indicates that while the risk of death from floods in the
world continues to drop since 2000, it still increases in the Arab
region, and that the percentage of GDP at risk of floods in the region
has tripled between the period of 1970-1979 and the period of 2000-2009.
Despite its high risk nature and exposure, the Arab region has not yet
been a focus area for the investment by the United Nations Trust Fund
for Human Security (UNTFHS). **In Tunisia**, data from the new disaster
loss database, completed with UNISDR and UNDP support in December 2013,
revealed that almost 2500 disasters struck the country over the last 30
years, causing 1075 deaths and economic losses of US\$ 756 million.
Disasters destroyed 17,821 houses and damaged another 24,728. As also
highlighted in a recent World Bank report, Tunisia's high-risk exposure,
combined with the existing political instability, including refugee
influx from its neighbouring countries, pose a serious threat to the
safety and security of its people, economy and sustainable growth as a
basis for peace and stability. Disaster loss data specifically
highlights the extensive vulnerabilities of Tunisia's local communities,
in particular those located in the poor mountainous northern part of the
country, which face threats including floods, landslides, forest fires,
high rain, cold waves and excessive snowfall. For example, in February
2012 Ain Draham, was totally isolated for three days due to snowfall and
landslides that caused seven deaths, directly affected 98 people and
caused considerable damage \-- the collapse of a bridge linking Ain
Draham and Hammam Bourguiba and five landslides cut the main roads
leading to the town. The estimated cost was 35 million dinars (US \$ 18
million). As mentioned earlier, the boarder stability is a key factor to
human security at local communities in Tunisian northwest regions. Thus,
strengthening the collaboration between Tunisia and its neighbour
country Algeria, knowing also the good experience of Algerian
administration in DRR is an opportunity for this project idea. UNISDR
and UNDP can give support to strengthen south-south cooperation between
Tunisian and Algerian cities on the border. The existing risks to human
security in Tunisia were also highlighted in a recent report[^1], which
found that political, economic insecurity, coupled with health, social
and public safety issues, led to an increasing human insecurity in
particular among citizens in the North-western part of the country where
the risk of disaster is highest. The report on threats to human security
in the area highlighted that the region is particularly prone to health
and food insecurity, exacerbated by the risk of disasters: "*le
nord-ouesttunisienestsouvent en proie à des situations exceptionnelle
scomme les canicules, les inondations et les hivers rudes, qui mènent à
la pénurie des denrée*".[^2]In the face of these significant challenges,
the report highlighted the importance and value of multi-stakeholder
consultative processes for developing policies and processes that
strengthen human security at the local level. In fact, the four regional
governments in north-west Tunisia made specific recommendations of how
human security could be enhance in the region. Thus, Tunisia is an ideal
candidate for the implementation of a disaster risk reduction project
that uses a human security approach, since the country has already taken
steps to include the mainstreaming of human security at the local level,
and the project will facilitate this transition and advance the
operational impact of the human security approach in Tunisia. The second
suggested country for this project is **Mauritania.** It was also chosen
for its high-risk exposure, which, combined with economic, social,
environmental and economic insecurities, provides a challenging context
for its population, in particular the most vulnerable. As set out in a
study by Anne Guest: Security in the Senegal River Basin, in:
'Globalization, Human Security & the African Experience, concerns for
human security in Mauritania and its neighbouring countries, all reliant
on the waters of the Senegal river basin, go back to independence in the
1950s. As Guest points out, large parts of Mauritania have always been
dependent on sustainable and trans-boundary management of the Senegal
River waters, as rain is barely sufficient for growing crops and
droughts are frequent in this part of the Sahel. Despite high degree of
risk, people were able to address their needs of human security through
an interdependent socio-economic system that followed the yearly
rainfall and water accessibility. Factors such as increasing droughts,
flooding and other natural disasters, social and political unrest,
population growth and subsequent Governments led to Mauritania today,
despite huge mineral resources, being among the world's poorest and
least developed countries, ranked 155 out of 187 countries on the 2013
UNDP Human Development Index. With 77% of its total lands being desert
Mauritania is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change
and accelerated degradation of natural resources. As a result of the
extensive human insecurity in the country, Mauritania was significantly
affected by severe droughts during the 2011 rainy season that resulted
in poor harvests, high food prices and loss of livestock. In January
2012, it was estimated that the food crisis was affecting approximately
700,000 people located mainly in the central and southern regions of
Hodh El Chargui, Guidhimaka, Gorgol, Brakna and Assaba. The drought had
an important effect on the food security, and thus the economic security
and health security of the population, with a report of the Food
Security Monitoring System (FSMS) published in July 2012 finding that as
a result of the drought, 32,3% of the population were classed as food
insecure, the highest percentage ever recorded in Mauritania, with10% of
those affected (about 200,000 people) located in urban areas[^3]. More
recently, in August/September 2013, severe flooding had a direct impact
on the livelihoods of 40,000 people[^4]. The lives and security of
Mauritania's people continue to be continuously threatened by the impact
of natural hazards including drought, landslides, flooding, storms,
silting coastal and dune erosion, infiltration of seawater into the
water table, as well as locust invasions, and wild fires as well as
extensive animal and plant production contribute significantly to the
high food insecurity. A large segment of the Mauritanian population
relies on traditional agriculture and livestock-related activities to
maintain their livelihoods, and, therefore, remain in a state of chronic
vulnerability due to unpredictable seasonal rains and climatic
conditions. As to FAO, (country profile, 22 January 2015) Children; farm
employees and daily workers are the most affected populations, with
child mortality and malnutrition in Mauritania being one of the highest
worldwide. The number of the vulnerable persons may vary from 400,000 up
to a million in the period of the lowest food availability as well as
during recurrent disaster crises. Moreover, the high import dependency
rate for food exposes the population to fluctuations of the global
market. Underlying factors such as poverty, rapid population growth,
weak economic governance, institutional instability, weak or no presence
of public services, including health services, corruption, and
overexploitation and loss of natural resources, further increase human
insecurity. Regional instability and political and social unrest has put
further pressure on the Mauritanian Government. For example, the armed
conflict in Northern Mali and the Western Sahel in general has forced
thousands of Malians to cross the border into Mauritania. As of November
2014, more than 54,700 Malian refugees were still living in Mauritania,
mostly in south-easternHodhEchChargui region. These refugees represent
an additional burden to a region that was affected by a serious food and
nutrition crisis in 2012. Moreover, the sharp decline in 2014 Dieri and
pasture production is expected to have a further negative impact on
farmers' incomes and access to food. Preliminary results of the recent
"Cadre Harmonisé" analysis in the country indicate that about 247 859
people are currently in Phase 3: "Crisis" and need urgent assistance.
The number of people in need of assistance is projected to increase to
424 372 by March 2015. Confronted with these risks, cities and
municipalities, in particular the capital Nouakchott, the country\'s
first deep-water port and major engine of growth, are of major concern
as many of the nomads and many subsistence farmers were forced into the
cities by recurrent droughts since the 1970s, building large informal
settlements without access to sanitation, health or social services and
thus highly exposed to disaster risks from which they -- as the country
as a whole - cannot recover. For example, in Nouakchott, poor families
continue to face the effects of 2012's widespread drought in the Sahel.
The crisis halted much of the region's food production, contributing to
galloping food prices for Mauritania's most vulnerable. With diminished
food purchasing power, many in the city still battle the daily
challenges of accessing the food and nutrition necessities for a healthy
life. Despite being rich in natural resources,and a steady annual growth
rate of about 6% per year, the gap between the very rich and the poor
continues to grow, with disturbing consequences mainly in urban areas.
[The alarming situation is no longer within the realms of donor
Governments and other institutions. Longer-term, people-centred
approaches such as the mainstreaming of disaster risk reduction and the
**human security approach** into national and local government policies
and plans are **needed to change the picture.**]{.underline}

### Human Security Good - Biopower

#### Individual-focused human security moves away from biopolitical structures

**Small 11** (Liana Small, "Human Security, Development and
Biopolitics",Dec 3, 2011, Accessed 7/19/19,
read:https://www.e-ir.info/2011/12/03/human-security-development-and-biopolitics/)///grf

In the post-Cold War era new forms of insecurity were introduced as
there was a departure from conflicts between states and a move towards
more inner-state and ethnic disputes (De Larrinaga and Doucet 2008).
This move drastically changed the idea of security and traditional
security studies, whereas at first it was at the borders of states where
security was breached, but as this changed, it forced us to look at
security in a different light. From this came a move towards critical
security studies, and further, a more human-centric approach to security
(Mutimer 2007). This moved away from brute, military protection and
force and started to encompass other aspects of society and progress
within nations. Many of these aspects, however, were found to be
threatened by the underdevelopment of states and it ultimately was
determined that many risks to human security were caused by this
declared underdevelopment. This lack of developed institutions directly
impacted the areas of human security. Therefore, through the
inextricable link between insecurity and underdevelopment, plans of
development were put in order to maintain national securities. However,
through the acts of development to ensure security, further insecurity
and exclusion amongst individuals was created. In this paper I will
introduce this concept of security of the individual and how these new
views of security support further a link between security and
development. I then will highlight the patterns of inclusion and
exclusion involved in processes of security and development and will
explain their biopolitical tendencies. Promotional Content Human
Security: restructuring the modern view of security In 1994, a new
approach to security studies emerged from a Toronto conference giving
birth to the concept of Critical Security Studies and drastically
changing the way in which security was viewed (Mutimer 2007). This
transformation of studies spurred from the questioning of what was
exactly the referent object of security---or "who or what is to be
secured" (Mutimer 2007, p. 88). The traditional answer was of course the
state: "security refers to protecting the state from external threats,
and the people living within the territory of the state are considered
secure to the degree that the state is secure" (Ibid.). As Maria Stern
and Joakim Öjendal assert in their observation of security practices,
they state that "in modern political imagination, 'security' has
traditionally revolved around the principle of modern state sovereignty.
If the state is not 'secure', then political order unravels and
ultimately citizens, and all other possible 'referents of security', are
imperiled" (Stern and Öjendal 2010, p. 14). This border-limited way of
thinking, however, impels an abundance of questions as to if this view
can be sufficient enough when discussing the overall state of being
'secure.' Keith Krause and Michael C. Williams point out that, in the
modern world, security "may be threatened by dynamics far beyond these
parameters" (Mutimer 2007, p. 88). Ways in which states can pose threats
to their citizens can be found and it is imperative to note how human
beings are "both secured and rendered insecure in ways other than by
states and military force" (Ibid: 89). As Stern and Öjendal continue,
"the nation-state system lacks the tools with which to contend with
today's threats -- which include terrorist networks, gender-based
violence, violent 'ethnic' discrimination, global pandemics and climate
change" (Stern and Öjendal 2010, p. 15). [This shift from traditional,
state-centric security studies to the titled Critical Security Studies
gave a platform for redefining security away from the state and
coincided with the conceptualization of a more human-centric focus which
"places people and the individual at its epicenter]{.underline}" (Kerr
2007, p. 122[). Security, therefore, has become much more than
protecting borders and exerting violence against state enemies. It
focuses more on "prioritizing the security of people rather than
states"]{.underline} (Duffield 2007, p. 3) [and becomes a primary reason
for and means of improving the human condition.]{.underline} This form
of "human security" focuses on the "particular vulnerabilities of
peoples who suffer violence from representatives of the state, as well
as other forms of violence and injustices" (Stern and Öjendal 2010, p.
15) and broadens security to embrace society reforms (Duffield 2007).
This shift brings in the element of development, labeling many risks to
human security as "largely associated with underdevelopment" and moves
to include in security "the protection and betterment of the world's
poor and marginalized peoples" (Ibid.). This shift is where Duffield
states there begins a "complementarity" with development and security
(Ibid.) which subsequently couples "security with the concerns of
international humanitarianism and human development" (De Larrinaga and
Doucet 2008, p. 518). Security---Development nexus: development as a
security measure Undoubtedly the practice of security and the acts of
development are entwined and "indeed, in current policy, the
'inextricable links' between security and development are repeated like
a mantra" (Hettne 2010, p. 34). It is understood that "economic
inequality, underdevelopment and poor governance \[are\] at the root of
armed conflict and crime" (Buur, Jensen and Stepputat 2007, p. 9) and
"while it is accepted that poverty does not cause terrorism, it is
argued that it fosters exclusion and alienation, which terrorist
organizations can exploit to garner support, if not recruits" (Duffield
2007, p. 2). Security then becomes trying to develop a desired "safe"
form of life---or "securing the Western way of life" (Ibid.)---one that
both supports stability within a country and abroad. The transnational
qualities of modern security threats are illustrated through the
phenomena of globalization and global terrorism and a driving force of
development in weak states stems from the correlation between
underdevelopment in these feeble states and overall security in 'rich'
(Western) states. This introduces a concept of 'in order to ensure
security up here, we must be concerned with development down there.'
Quoting former Prime Minister Tony Blair, Duffield highlights this way
of thinking in relation to the United Kingdom's interest in development
in Africa. Blair is quoted stating that "famines and instability
'thousands of miles away lead to conflict, despair, mass migration and
fanaticism that can affect us all. So for reasons of self-interest as
well as morality, we can no longer turn our back on Africa' (Blair
2005)" and "because development reduces poverty and hence the risk of
future instability, it also improves our own security" (Duffield 2007,
p. 2). This undeniable link between security and development undoubtedly
calls for further attention and "it should thus be an obvious task for
theory to clarify more deeply in what ways development and security can
be (causally) related and how the two may influence each other" (Hettne
2010, p. 34). Further, attention should be drawn to these efforts of
development for guaranteeing security as they can tend to be writ with
elements of exclusion and can subsequently cause a loss of security and
freedom to various individuals involved. Power plays of security:
development as biopolitics Development as a technique for security
highlights the discussed power structure of biopower (Duffield 2007).
Further, securitization of development reflects models of biopolitics
and tendencies towards inclusion and exclusion that can in turn render
development as insecure. Biopower, a political power explained by
philosopher Michel Foucault, "deals with the population as a political
problem" and strives to control, manage and regularize society (Foucault
2003, p. 245). Through the act of regulation, biopower seeks to produce
a certain safe and developed citizen---one that will maintain the
'equilibrium' of society and uphold a stable way of life. This act of
regularization is common in actions of development as well. In their
analysis of the security-development nexus, Buur, Jensen and Stepputat
draw attention to this development and "modern production of citizens"
which they say "works through the exclusion of people who are considered
improper, out of place and dangerous" (Buur, Jensen and Stepputat 2007,
p. 16). Securitization of development in turn becomes a divide between
good or safe individuals and states and bad or dangerous others. When
speaking in relation to Africa, the creation of these dichotomies can in
fact foster fear and unease and "divide the continent from the rest of
the world" (Duffield 2007, p. 4). To exemplify this pattern of division
further, Buur, Jensen and Stepputat illustrate post-apartheid South
Africa explaining that while there was unification within the state,
there was alternatively a creation of divide outside. So to maintain a
desired, peaceful way of life within South Africa, there has been an
exclusion of "dangerous" people on the outside which "has recast the
external borders as the threshold of national belonging, with dire
consequences from members of the Southern African region" (Buur, Jensen
and Stepputat 2007, p. 17). Duffield further recognizes development's
negative biopolitical tendencies stating that it can be seen as
unbalanced techniques exercised by developed states working to secure
their own interests. He says that "the benevolence with which
development cloaks itself---its constant invocation of rights, freedom
and the people---conceals a stubborn will to manage and contain disorder
rather than resolve it" (Duffield 2007, preface i). He explains that:
"rather than development being concerned with reducing the economic gap
between rich and poor countries...it functions to contain and manage
underdevelopment's destabilizing effects, especially its circulatory
epiphenomena such as undocumented migrants, asylum seekers, transborder
shadow economies or criminal networks" (Duffield 2007, preface ix).
[This development as biopolitcs observation showcases the lack of
attention to individual security apparent in biopower. As Foucault
asserts, **biopower is not interested in individual human security** as
there is "absolutely no question relating to an individual
body]{.underline}" (Foucault 2003, p. 246). It is, as he says: ["not a
matter of taking the individual at the level of individuality but...of
using overall mechanisms and acting in such a way as to achieve overall
states of equilibrium or regularity...taking control of life and the
biological processes of man-as-species and of ensuring that they are not
disciplined, but regularized"]{.underline} (Ibid.). This brings about
the claim of biopolitics as treating life as "bare life" and entailing
"a disregard for aspects of personhood" and instead involving "protocols
of communication and administration that treat people as objects"
(Edkins 2008, p. 212). These correlations between development and
biopolitics bring about questions as to where the presence of human
security is and begs deeper observation and study for the connections
between security and development and their effects on the individual.

### 2AC - Human Rights Framing Good

#### Human Rights are important and governments are **[required]{.underline}** to uphold them, it is not a question of theology, but one of obligation

**AFHR No Date** (The Advocates For Human Rights is an organization
specializing in educating people about human rights around the world. "
What are humann rights and why are they important?", AFHR, no date,
Accessed 7/18/19,
http://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/human_rights_basics)//grf

Q: What are Human Rights? ANSWER: [Human rights are standards that allow
all people to live with dignity, freedom, equality, justice, and peace.
Every person has these rights simply because they are human
beings]{.underline}. [They are guaranteed to everyone without
distinction of]{.underline} any kind, such as race, color, sex,
language, [religion, political or other opinion]{.underline}, national
or social origin, property, birth, or other status. Human rights are
essential to the full development of individuals and communities. Many
people view human rights as a set of moral principles that apply to
everyone. Human rights are also part of international law, contained in
treaties and declarations that spell out specific rights that countries
are required to uphold. Countries often incorporate human rights in
their own national, state, and local laws. Q: Why are Human Rights
Important? ANSWER: [Human rights reflect the minimum standards necessary
for people to live with dignity. Human rights give people the freedom to
choose how they live, how they express themselves, and what kind of
government they want to support, among many other things. Human rights
also guarantee people the means necessary to satisfy their basic needs,
such as food, housing, and education, so they can take full advantage of
all opportunities. Finally, by guaranteeing life, liberty, equality, and
security, human rights protect people against abuse by those who are
more powerful. According to the United Nations, human rights: "Ensure
that a human being will be able to fully develop and use human qualities
such as intelligence, talent, and conscience and satisfy his or her
spiritual and other]{.underline} Human Rights Characteristics\... Q:
Where do Human Rights come from? ANSWER: The modern human rights era can
be traced to struggles to end slavery, genocide, discrimination, and
government oppression. Atrocities during World War II made clear that
previous efforts to protect individual rights from government violations
were inadequate. Thus was born the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
(UDHR) as part of the emergence of the United Nations (UN). The UDHR was
the first international document that spelled out the "basic civil,
political, economic, social and cultural rights that all human beings
should enjoy." The declaration was ratified without opposition by the UN
General Assembly on December 10, 1948. When it was adopted, the UDHR was
not legally binding, though it carried great moral weight. In order to
give the human rights listed in the UDHR the force of law, the UN
drafted two treaties, the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights (ICESCR). The division of rights between these two
covenants is artificial, reflecting the global ideological divide during
the Cold War. Though politics prevented the creation of a unified
treaty, the two covenants are interconnected, and the rights contained
in one covenant are necessary to the fulfillment of the rights contained
in the other. Together, the UDHR, ICCPR, and ICESCR are known as the
International Bill of Human Rights. They contain a comprehensive list of
human rights that governments must respect, protect, and fulfill. Human
Rights Outlined in the International Bill of Rights The right to
equality and freedom from discrimination The right to life, liberty, and
personal security Freedom from torture and degrading treatment The right
to equality before the law The right to a fair trial The right to
privacy Freedom of belief and religion Freedom of opinion Right of
peaceful assembly and association The right to participate in government
The right to social security The right to work The right to an adequate
standard of living The right to education The right to health The right
to food and housing Q: Who is Responsible for Upholding Human Rights?
ANSWER: [Under]{.underline} human [rights treaties]{.underline},
[governments have the primary responsibility for protecting and
promoting human rights]{.underline}. However, governments are not solely
responsible for ensuring human rights. The UDHR states: "Every
individual and every organ of society ... shall strive by teaching and
education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms and by
progressive measures, national and international, to secure their
universal and effective recognition and observance." This provision

Government parties to a treaty must do the following: Respect Protect

framework for guaranteeing the rights of all people, regardless of where
they live. International human rights law is contained in many different
types of documents, including treaties, charters, conventions, and
covenants. Despite the different official names, these documents are all
considered treaties and have the same effect under international law:
countries that ratify a treaty are legally obligated to protect the
rights it describes. The human rights treaty process usually begins at
the United Nations or a similar international body. Legal and subject
matter experts might first create a draft of the treaty. After the draft
is written, the UN or other body will arrange a meeting between
representatives of interested countries to negotiate the final terms, or
content, of the treaty. This can be a lengthy process if large numbers
of countries want to participate in the drafting process.
Non-governmental organizations are sometimes allowed to offer
recommendations during some of the stages of the drafting process. After
the negotiating countries agree on a final text of the treaty, the
treaty is opened for ratification by countries that want to become
parties to it. Countries have different methods for acceding to or
ratifying treaties. For the United States to become a party to a treaty,
the president must first sign it, and then present it to the Senate,
where two-thirds of the senators must vote to ratify it. Through
ratification, a country agrees to be legally bound by the terms of the
treaty. Countries that ratify treaties are allowed to enter reservations
to those instruments. Reservations are statements made by a country that
"modify the legal effect of certain provisions of the treaty." Entering
a reservation allows a government to agree to most of a treaty, while
excluding or limiting parts that might be controversial or
unconstitutional in its own country. Many countries have entered
reservations to the major human rights treaties, which can limit the
effectiveness of the treaties in protecting people against abuses
committed by their governments. Sources Declaration of Independence.

#### Their critique is nothing more than a manifestation of liberal discourse without any viable alternative

Rights without Subjects The biopolitical critique of the discourse of
human rights is that rather than a mechanism of empowerment it is an
exercise of power. As with the agreement on the universal agency, here
the **[post-structuralist critique is the mirror image of the liberal
discourse]{.underline}**. For liberal human rights advocates there is no
distinct difference between human rights and democratic and civil
rights. All rights claims are seen to be equally empowering and able to
tame power in the name of ethics and equality. Here, the extension of
law is read to be the extension of the realm of freedom and a
restriction on sovereign power. The post-structuralist response is to
argue that the liberal discourse reveals the truth in its blurring of
the relationship between democracy and dictatorship, law as ad hoc and
arbitrary power and law as a reflection of the autonomy and agency of
legally constituted subjects (Agamben 1998: 10). For the critics of
human rights regimes, the extension of a discourse of rights and law
merely enhances the power of liberal governance. Indeed, Georgio Agamben
has captured well the ethico-juridical blurring of human rights regimes
as a 'state of exception', by which he means not a dictatorship but a
hollowing out or emptying of the content of law: ...the state of
exception has today reached its maximum worldwide deployment. The
normative aspect of law can thus be obliterated and contradicted with
impunity by a governmental violence that -- while ignoring international
law externally and producing a permanent state of exception internally
-- nevertheless still claims to be applying the law. (Agamben 2005: 87)
However, in reading the state of exception as the essential nature of
the sovereign state and law, Agamben argues that the lesson is that
progressive politics can never operate within the modern state form:
'Politics has suffered a lasting eclipse because it has been
contaminated by law, seeing itself, at best, as constituent power (that
is violence that makes law), when it is not reduced to merely the power
to negotiate with the law.' (2005: 88) In his earlier work, Homo Sacer,
he argued: 5 It is almost as if...every decisive political event were
double-sided: the spaces, the liberties, and the rights won by
individuals in their conflicts with central powers always simultaneously
prepared a tacit but increasing inscription of the individual's lives
within the state order, thus offering a new and more dreadful foundation
for the very sovereign power from which they wanted to liberate
themselves. (Agamben 1998: 121) [For both the liberal advocates of human
rights and the radical post-structuralist critics there is no specific
understanding of the problem of human rights as based on nonsocially
constituted legal subjects. For both liberal human rights advocates and
poststructuralists, rights are understood to be independent of rights
subjects.]{.underline} For liberal advocates, it is precisely because
the poor and excluded cannot enforce their rights that an external
agency needs to step in to empower them[. For post-structuralists this
is clear in the view that the declaration of rights constitutes the
subject, rights precede and interpolate the subject]{.underline}
(Douzinas 2007: 92). Douzinas stresses the darker side of rights; 'the
inexorable rise of registration, classification and control of
individuals and populations' (2007: 129). Post-structuralist critics
exaggerate the claims of rights as independent from subjects to view all
rights claims as made by non-subjects (Agamben's 'bare life'). For
radical post-structuralists the ambiguity of human rights frameworks,
which can only empower those who decide on the content and ad hoc
implementation are read to be, not an attack on modern frameworks of
rights and law, but are essentialised as the key to understanding the
modern state as a biopolitical power[. The radical critics critique the
claims of the liberal advocates of human rights by essentialising them
as liberal rights claims per se. This one-sided understanding of rights,
through breaking their connection to rights subjects, produces an
exaggeration of the liberal human rights critique of the political
sphere of representation.]{.underline} For liberal advocates of human
rights, representational claims are problematic because they may
undermine rights protections, for poststructuralists any participation
in the political sphere of the territorial state is inherently
disempowering. For advocates of human rights regimes it appears that all
rights are good and liberatory, for their post-structuralist critics it
appears that all rights are bad and oppressive. What they share is a
lack of understanding of rights frameworks which are shaped and
underpinned by political subjects. For both, humanity is cast as 'bare
life', rights are necessary to protect vulnerable human subjects and
these are rights without subjective content; in other words, rights of
dependency. Rather than a critique of human rights for denying rights to
the political subject, the biopolitical critique argues that this is the
case for all rights-based discourses. What neither the liberal or
biopolitical perspectives offer is a more reflective or historicised
understanding of why law is being hollowed out and why the rights of
autonomy appear to be increasingly problematic. Both [approaches make
highly essentialised claims about the nature of rights and make little
attempt to locate the content of rights claims within social
struggle.]{.underline} Here the discourse does all the work (as
indicated above), either interpolating citizen subjects as the objects
of universal 6 power or offering universal empowerment to the marginal
and excluded by challenging the particularistic interests of power.
Neither the advocates nor the critics reflect on the historically
specific context in which the subject has been taken out of rights
discourses, nor on the indeterminacy of law, described as the 'permanent
state of exception'. The Unmediated Relationship between the Particular
and the Universal Where both liberal advocates and post-structuralist
critics agree is on the problematic nature of domestic representational
politics. Both seek to bypass the bonds of territorial politics in a
mirror image of each other. But, again, the post-structuralists
exaggerate the rejection of the liberal universalists. For liberal
proponents of human rights regimes, advocacy for the Other is opposed to
representation; for radical poststructuralist opponents, disengagement
from state-based politics is premised on a nonadvocacy relation to the
Other. In focusing on biopower as a means of critiquing universalist
discourses of human rights, Duffield, Jabri and Douzinas are reducing
critique to moral statements about power. In effect they take the
conclusions of Foucault, that liberal discourses are an exercise of
power, without making any attempt to further our understanding. In fact,
they manage to invert the intentions of Foucault which was to clarify
the importance of human subjective agency for governmental power and
authority. Foucault himself stated that his analysis of biopower was
'not in any way a general theory of what power is. It is not a part or
even the start of such a theory', merely the study of the effects of
liberal governance practices, which posit as their goal the interests of
society -- the population - rather than government (Foucault 2007; 1).
Biopolitics describes government in the age of liberal modernity, where
the state is no longer alien and external to society. The population are
no longer an alien mass to be coerced or manipulated, as in the
pre-modern time of Machiavelli; instead, the needs of society as a whole
'offer a surface on which \[power\] can get a hold', or 'secure' itself
(Ibid.: 75). Rather than the disciplinary sovereign power of external
rule, the state operates on the basis of 'governmentality' of the
liberal freedoms of the political and the economic sphere, where society
(capitalist social relations) internally generates the need for
regulatory governance (Ibid.: 91-99). Foucault is, in fact, describing
the dynamic of liberal modernity, understood as a society-orientated
process, with a social, collective purpose or goal, rather than a
process of narrow regulatory governance by the disciplinary techniques
of the sovereign. Foucault states: 'I think this marks an important
break. Whereas the end of sovereignty is internal to itself and gets its
instruments from itself in the form of law, the end of government is
internal to the things it directs; it is to be sought in the perfection,
maximization, or intensification of the processes it directs' (Ibid.:
99). Ironically, whilst Foucault himself understood his work on biopower
as a correction to the reading of his work on disciplinarity, which
created the impression of merely asserting 'the monotonous assertion of
power' (Foucault 2007: 56; see also Jean Baudrillard's assertion \[1987:
33\] that for Foucault, power always wins, at issue is merely its
modulation) Duffield, Jabri and Douzinas, in effect, read biopower with
7 society taken out of the analysis. They do this through reading
Foucault through Agamben, who reads biopower as the discourse of human
rights, the indistinction between being a subject and object of rights,
who writes: The Foucauldian thesis will then have to be corrected or, at
least, completed, in the sense that what characterizes modern politics
is not so much the inclusion of zoē in the polis... Instead the decisive
fact is that, together with the process by which the exception
everywhere becomes the rule, the realm of bare life... gradually begins
to coincide with the political realm, and exclusion and inclusion,
outside and inside, bios and zoē, right and fact, enter into a zone of
irreducible indistinction. (Agamben 1998: 9) [While Agamben at least
openly explains his critique of Foucault in his use of the concept of
biopower, most authors just take on board his use of biopower as if
there was little difference or Agamben was merely drawing out the logic
of Foucault.]{.underline} Douzinas, for example, argues that: 'Agamben
has radicalised Foucault's approach by arguing that power has always
operated on bare biological life.' (2007: 116) Douzinas offers no
explanation of why Agamben's approach is a 'radicalised version' or why
it should be preferable to Foucault's. Jabri provides a good example of
this elision between the two. She asserts the distinction, but again
offers no reason for choosing Agamben over Foucault: The subject of
biopower in Foucault is fully the subject capable of selfgovernment,
ever shifting as well as subject to constraint within the trajectories
of power. The subject of Agamben's bare life, however, is devoid of
subjectivity and its existential complexities and differentiations.
Jabri goes further in reinterpreting and removing subjective social
agency from Foucault; taking his concepts out of their conceptual
framework without clarity or explanation. This is done be explicitly
replacing Foucault's focus on concrete social relations in Society Must
Be Defended (Foucault 2003) with the empty abstraction of 'humanity'. In
shifting Foucault's view of biopower from a national context to one of
international relations, she argues that Foucault's famous formulation
that war is no longer fought on behalf of the sovereign but on behalf of
society, can be reformulated or understood in terms of war fought 'in
the name of humanity' inscribed in the terms of the 'neoliberal global
order' (Jabri 2007: 134-5). Here, in taking Foucault from a domestic
context - where the fact that war could only be fought on behalf of
society, in the name of national interests, gave war a distinct social
content, indicating that actions of the sovereign could only be
legitimised on the basis of citizenship demands - to an international
context, fundamentally blurs Foucault's critique of liberal democratic
rights with the critique of the fictional rights of global human rights
advocacy. Jan Selby, in his recent attempt at a ground clearing critique
of Foucauldian IR, poses the question of the problem of the translation
of Foucault from a domestic to an international context (Selby 2007). He
argues that the inscription of universal liberalism is accidentally a
product of this move, rather than seeing that this is essential to
critique the human rights discourse as an act of liberal modernity. The
post-structuralist critique is parasitical on the liberal human rights
discourse, which in separating rights from their grounding subjects
opens up the possibility of critiquing 8 liberalism as essentially based
on the subjection of citizens and their interpolation in the language of
rights. This has little to do with Foucault's understanding or concerns,
which revolved around extending Marx's critique of the 'freedoms' of
liberal modernity. In effect, the post-Focauldian's seek an easier
topic, the 'unfreedoms' highlighted by Agamben, where the concentration
camp, the totalitarian state and Guantanamo Bay constitute the moral
indictment of liberalism (Agamben 1998:4). Liberal advocates of human
rights assert that the causes of the human are more important than the
representative decisions of the citizen, and seek to bypass the masses
in the direct lobbying of power and calls for the judiciary to take a
larger role in policy-making. This elitist dismissal of the masses takes
a more exaggerated form in the critique of the political forwarded by
the post-structuralist theorists, who suggest that the purity of radical
critique can only be preserved by avoiding instrumental activity and
focusing merely on the radical identity of the theorist. Duffield
suggests that the only alternative is to assert that we are all victims
of governmentalism: 'we are all governed and therefore in solidarity'
(2007: 232). Apparently we should focus on what we share with
post-colonial societies, not offering the hierarchical 'solidarity' of
development or political autonomy but instead the solidarity of learning
from the poor and being marginalised as equals; once humbled: 'through a
practical politics based on the solidarity of the governed we can aspire
to opening ourselves to the spontaneity of unpredictable encounters'
(2007: 234). In highlighting the hegemonic frameworks and interests
underpinning Kaldor's idealistic approach to new frameworks of 'human'
rights, Duffield appears to throw the baby of human agency out with the
bathwater of development, rejecting modernizing aspirations towards
democracy and development for recreating oppressive neoliberal
biopolitical frameworks of control and regulation. Jabri argues that we
need a new cosmopolitanism, but one that reflectively recognises that
'any discourses that view their worth in universal terms, are but
expressions of "forces of domination" based upon explicit principles of
exclusion' (2007: 177). Instead, the 'politics of peace' \[emphasis in
original\] emphasises a solidarity which: ...makes no claim to
universality, nor is it teleological in outlook... Rather, the politics
of peace expresses local and often rather invisible acts, expressions of
solidarity that are neither hierarchically defined nor suggestive of any
claim to universality. (2007: 177) For Douzinas, political opposition
has to take the form of a 'cosmopolitanism to come' of individualised
protest: Dissatisfaction with nation, state, the international comes
from a bond between singularities. What binds me to an Iraqi or a
Palestinian is not membership of humanity, citizenship of the world or
of a community but a protest against citizenship, against nationality
and thick community. This bond cannot be contained in traditional
concepts of community and cosmos or of polis and state. What binds my
world to that of others is our absolute singularity and total
responsibility beyond citizen and human, beyond national and
international. The cosmos to come is the world of each unique one, of 9
whoever or anyone; the polis, the infinite number of encounters of
singularities. (2007: 295) Despite the differences in their views of
whether the development of universal human rights regimes is to be
welcomed or criticized, both liberal advocates and poststructuralist
critics seek to ground their position of critique on the basis of their
'global solidarity' with the non-Western poor and marginal. Both seek a
vicarious radicalism or legitimacy in their distancing from
representational demands and their ability to stand outside of politics
seen as an instrumental aspiration for power. The rejection of political
representation of the advocates and the critics of human rights
demonstrates the ideological nature of radical discourse today. The
further radical political claims shift from engagement with society the
more radical they become. The advocates of human rights in the 1990s
were the first to distance themselves from state-based politics, finding
a freedom in the free-floating rights of global advocacy. The
post-structuralist critics of the 2000s exaggerate this rejection of
society, finding an even more radical way to express their subjectivity
and at the same time a more radical critique of the prison or
'concentration camp' of state-based politics. The irony is that it is
not just radical critics which seek to escape the responsibilities of
the politics of representation. It is possible that state leaders and
political elites in the West similarly are more at home when making
radical declarations about global rights than they are when it comes to
engaging with their own societies. Conclusion Rather than being a stand
against the human rights assault on liberal democratic frameworks of
formal legal and political equality, the biopolitical critics of the
emerging human rights regimes argue that they are oppressive precisely
because they are framed in terms of liberal rights. [The alternative
they offer is not a defence of liberal democratic equality but a further
retreat from political engagement. The rise of the human in
international relations discourse reflects the implosion of political
frameworks of contestation. The **biopolitical critique of human
rights** **does not seek** to highlight the contingent nature of this
framework or **to articulate an alternative.** It highlights the depth
of the problem, the implosion of the political subject which gave
content to frameworks of rights, **rather than the
solution**.]{.underline}

### Alt Fails - Schmitt

#### Schmitt and other theorists of political theology don't holistically look at empirics and are idealistic in their reliance on discourse

University, "The Rise and Limits of Biopolitical Critiques of Human
Rights Regimes", University of Pittsburgh, April 7, 2008, Accessed

The debates around human rights in the 2000s revolve around acceptance
that the human rights framework reflects an immanent universalising
power. For the 1990s radicals, this universalising power which sought to
undermine the power of state sovereignty and privilege the rights of
individuals was implicitly seen to be a progressive force. This
universal was grounded in a view of an emerging cosmopolitan or
universalist or global consciousness in the wake of the ending of the
Cold War (for example, Shaw 1994). The discourse of human rights was a
universal one, therefore it was assumed that states were not capable of
originating and bearing this discourse, the leading agents of human
rights approaches were assumed to be non-state actors, primarily NGOs,
often described as 'norm entrepreneurs' (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998).
The rise of this universalist discourse was often understood in a social
constructivist framework, based on the 'power of ideas' and the
importance of global information networks (Risse, Ropp and Sikkink
1999). For human rights advocates, such as Mary Kaldor, since the end of
the Cold War we have been witnessing a fundamental political struggle
between civil society and state-based approaches (Kaldor 2003, 2007).
For the 1990s radicals, the universal discourse was driven by
progressive agency 'from below' and therefore was a challenge to power.
In our more disillusioned 2000s, particularly since 9/11, there has
arisen an alternative critical reading of the discourse of universals.
Often [the starting point for these critics is the work of German legal
theorist Carl Schmitt, who, writing in the mid 20th Century was highly
critical of US claims to uphold universal human rights in opposition to
what he saw as the European view of international law which privileged
sovereign rights (see Schmitt 2003). Schmitt claimed famously that
'however invokes humanity wants to cheat']{.underline} (Schmitt 1996:
54). Rather than a new progressive universal subject arising from below,
critical theorists in the 2000s saw a new universal subject arising from
above. Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri in the their path-breaking book
Empire (2001), first published in 2000, saw global neo-liberal
governance as superseding the state-based international system, with the
US no longer viewed in traditional terms of state-based imperialist
power but as a representative of the universalising power of Empire. In
a direct challenge to the advocates of human rights, [these critical
approaches have been constructed within post-structuralist frameworks;
drawing on theorists such as Carl Schmitt, Michel Foucault and Giorgio
Agamben]{.underline} and suggesting that a new universal subject may be
emerging, not from below, but from above. In the recent work of Mark
Duffield (2007) Vivienne Jabri (2007) and Costas Douzinas (2007) this
framework is melded with post-Foucauldian readings of human rights as an
exercise of biopower. In this framework, new global governmental
practices are highlighted which are legitimised through the privileging
of declarations of the rights of the human over and above the formal
rights framework of sovereignty and nonintervention. For Duffield, the
focus on human rights, expressed in the discourses of state failure and
the merging of security and development, creates a biopolitical blank
cheque to override the formal rights of sovereignty on the basis of the
needs of securing the human. For Jabri, the recasting of military
intervention in terms of the human undermines the state-based order and
the line between domestic and global politics constituting a new global
biopolitical order. For Douzinas, human rights 3 discourses undermine
territorial forms of sovereignty but enable the emergence of a new
'super-sovereign' of global hegemonic power. Here, the universalism of
liberal human rights advocates is 'stood on its head' to argue that it
is the universalising interests of power, understood in vague terms of
biopolitical neo-liberal global governance, rather than the cosmopolitan
ethics of empowerment, which drives the discursive practices of human
rights regimes. As the 1990s liberal discourse has been challenged by
the 2000s post-structuralist discourse, we seem to be caught up in a
contestation over which academics have the most progressive or radical
interpretation of new universal discourses of international relations.
However[, I don't think that this debate about whether human rights
regimes reflect a challenge to power or a new more oppressive exercise
of global power has much to do with empirical facts, which appear to be
selectively applied to fit the academic's preference. It seems to me
that there is an unhealthy reliance on the universalist discourse itself
as the source of value judgements]{.underline}. This view would seem to
be supported by the fact that those who support liberal universalism
(i.e. liberals) tend to be supportive of human rights regimes, while
those critical of liberal universals (i.e. post-structuralists and
post-Marxists) see them as new articulations of liberal frameworks of
power. At the level of discursive analysis the choice between these two
approaches, to my mind, is a purely subjective one. Neither one
satisfactorily grounds the existence of a new universal subject which is
the agent of human rights regimes as a universalising discourse. Both
approaches suggest that human rights regimes reflect the transformed
nature of international relations, yet neglect to investigate why the
human rights discourse has been mainstreamed by leading Western states
and state-based international institutions or to explain why there
should be so little contestation over such an allegedly radical
reshaping of power relations. Many years ago, in a critique of German
idealist philosophy, which could be equally applied to the approach of
human rights advocates and critics today, Karl Marx argued that: In
direct contrast to German philosophy which descends from heaven to
earth, here we ascend from earth to heaven. That is to say, we do not
set out from what men say, imagine, conceive... in order to arrive at
men in the flesh. We set out from real, active men, and on the basis of
their real life processes we demonstrate the development of the
ideological reflexes and echoes of this life-process... In the first
method of approach the starting point is consciousness taken as the
living individual; in the second method, which conforms to real life; it
is the real living individuals themselves, and consciousness is
considered solely as their consciousness. (Marx 1982: 47) Rather than
study the ideological appearances, in order to understand the changing
practices of states or the transformation of the international system,
Marx suggested studying the context and relations of the actors
themselves. Rather than assessing the discourse or the 'ideological
reflexes and echoes' of changing international relations on their own
terms, I suggest a much more mediated and contingent approach to 4
understanding the appeal of human rights frameworks (see further,
Chandler 2007a; 2007b). If there is no universalising agency in the form
of global civil society or Empire, then we need to explain the
ideological forms in which international relations is conceived starting
from the need to locate and explain the agency behind them. This
investigation would need to engage the apparent paradox of why Western
states have sought to project their power in post-territorial,
post-national, post-sovereign terms. It is possible that it is the
hollowing out of the state as a framework for domestic politics which
results in the projection of a post-state ideological framework.
However, [suggesting that the weakness of states as the political
subjects of the international arena is a central overlooked feature of
universalist discourse, is very different from asserting that it is the
rise of new universal subjects which is driving human rights
regimes]{.underline}. [It would also invest these regimes with much more
contingency than the unmediated universalising discourses of rights. In
fact, as we shall see, it is the critical post-structuralists who tend
to be more idealistic in their unmediated reading of the universalist
discourse as they see few existant barriers or limits to universal human
rights frameworks.]{.underline}

concocts a worldview where they deserve their lowly status, or they\'re
happy with their lot, or they should be. That worldview persists even
when overt racism doesn\'t. A situation can remain unfair, prejudice can
still be widespread, even if the dominant class deplores overt
oppression and thinks they\'ve gotten past it. Oppression turns into
privilege. An oppressed class also, understandably, gets cranky.

In this way, Buber also gives us a vantage to question contemporary
applications of political theology more broadly. [When theorists today
invoke theological ideas, it is almost never to support Schmitt's state
theory but rather to advance emancipatory and egalitarian aims
antithetical to his politics]{.underline} [(Agamben]{.underline}
\[2011\] 2013; Badiou 2003; Raschke 2015; Reinhard , Santner, [and
Zizek]{.underline} ˇ 2005; Robbins 2011; Santner 2011). Indeed it is
precisely the promise of harnessing the power of religious rhetoric
without its accompanying metaphysical commitments that has made
political theology attractive to a wide range of postmodern thinkers
grasping for new sources of normativity. Buber, seemingly, would be
sympathetic to these efforts. But as should now be plain, his project
differs from them at its core. [Adopting the mode of political theology
entails theorizing analogically from religion, assigning theological
concepts to tasks traditionally reserved for moral and political ones:
The sovereign's power becomes like God's power]{.underline} (Schmitt
\[1922\] 2005); [the state's "general will" becomes like the deity's
"general will]{.underline}" (Rousseau \[1762\] 2010); [the American
people's presence in politics becomes like the divine presence
"hovering" over the universe]{.underline} (de Tocqueville \[1835\] 2000,
1.1.4[). Yet what Buber learned from both Hebrew scripture and recent
history is that we are not gods. We are creatures in flesh and blood.
And neither freedom from domination nor solidarity with others can be
achieved by feigning divinity.]{.underline} Thus instead of using
theological language to support preconceived ideas, Buber looks to the
Hebrew Bible to ground his normative views. His concept of theopolitics
arises from ethically attentive exegesis, not philosophical rumination.
It reflects an enduring lesson of Israel's nomadic ethos: That our hope,
in the end, lies not with the philosopher's pen or the sovereign's
sword, but in the hard, daily task of ethical life. Political theory may
help to guide these labors; only we can work for their success.

#### Polytheism thumps Schmitt's theories of political theology

Science at the University of Notre Dame and an author for many think
tanks. "Against Schmitt\'s Political Theology, Prometheus or Pandora?

In "The Rejection of Political Theology: A Critique of Hans Blumenberg,"
Richard Faber reconstructs two alternatives to Carl Schmitt's political
theology. Faber draws the first alternative from Hans Blumenberg.
Blumenberg, whose later work explores how metaphor orients thought,
proposes a "polytheistic" alternative to "monotheistic" political
theology. Polytheism is an early modern metaphor for plural sovereignty,
underlying the checks and balances of liberalism. Sympathetically,
Blumenberg believes [a polytheistic political theology turns away from
Schmitt's "monotheistic" picture of sovereignty where one sovereign
decides the state of exception]{.underline}. After expositing
Blumenberg's polytheistic political theology, Faber rejects it. Instead,
he turns to Walter Benjamin's eschatological political theology.
Monotheists have been promised an apocalypse, a violent divine
intervention, to restore justice in the future. Unlike the Schmittian
state of exception, this hoped-for intervention would ground no new
legal constitution. Benjamin radicalizes the state of exception into the
"pure violence" of a Marxist revolution aimed at destroying the
political state altogether. Philosophical anthropology is at the center
of the Schmitt-Blumenberg debate.\[1\] Schmitt is sympathetic to the
Hobbesian vision that the state of nature is a war of all against all.
Against Schmitt's "anthropological realism," Blumenberg insists that the
behavior of human beings in the state of nature is underdetermined.
Faber puts this debate---encapsulated by [Brad
Tabas](http://journal.telospress.com/content/2012/158/135.extract) in
Telos last spring---in a wider context of rival political theologies.
According to Blumenberg, Schmitt's anthropological realism is already
determined by monotheism. The friend-enemy distinction is predetermined
by a believer-unbeliever distinction made by devotees of a single god.
Faber unpacks Blumenberg's idiosyncratic response: complicating
Schmitt's monotheism with a polytheistic counter-myth. Faber turns to
Blumenberg's Arbeit und Mythos (1980) to reconstruct the attempt to
offer "[a polytheology]{.underline} which is supposed to [escape the
Schmittian definition of the political]{.underline}" (180).\[2\] In
search of a political theology for liberal pluralism, Blumenberg
introduces new gods to complicate the dualism of Schmitt's authoritarian
political vision. Faber, like Blumenberg, takes for granted that Schmitt
has a "monotheistic" political theology. On this view, [for
Schmitt]{.underline}, the sovereign in the state of exception is an
anagoge for the one god's radically transcendent will. [The sovereign
may decide between equally legitimate value systems, but ultimately
valorizes one over another.]{.underline} Importantly, the decision of
the sovereign overrides plural norms. In this way, for Blumenberg,
Schmitt's decisionism is a secularization of specifically monotheistic
dogma. To defeat Schmitt's philosophical anthropology, Blumenberg sets
his sights on political monotheology. There is precedent for this
approach. In modernity---or since the French Revolution---the old place
occupied by God is neither abandoned nor "secularized." Instead,
according to Blumenberg, there is a reoccupation (Umbesetzung) of
theology by new political gods. Faber seizes upon Blumenberg's gloss of
the Goethe's motto Nemo contra deum nisi deus ipse ("None stand against
god except a god"). Against the sovereigns of Christendom, Faber
explains, early modern liberals mimicked the godlike lawgivers of
Greco-Roman polytheism. In Goethe's eyes, Napoleon was a Prometheus;
Rousseau followed Numa introducing civil religion. Enlightenment
liberals invoked the classical world---reactivating the metaphors of
polytheism---to depose Christian sovereigns. Describing these
revolutionaries, Faber quotes Marx's Eighteenth Brumaire, "in such
periods of crisis they anxiously call up the spirits of the past to
their purpose, and borrow from them names, battle-cries, and costumes in
order to present the new scene of history in this time-honored disguise
and this borrowed language" (175). [The political theology of Christian
monotheism was **reoccupied** not by rationalism and deism]{.underline},
Faber and Blumenberg show, [but **by polytheism**. Multiple political
leaders were divinized.]{.underline} Faber sees a precedent in the
mature Goethe's answer of the Prometheus myth. When one learns to take
the power of the gods, more can follow. Deposing the sovereign and
divinizing revolutionaries, early modern liberal revolutionaries opened
the Pandora's Box of polytheism (183). [Blumenberg's polytheism metaphor
obviates Schmitt's state of exception because it makes the gods'
decisions the norm.]{.underline} [The many gods in the political arena
strike a balance of power. When normal politics is recast as divine
activity, the state of exception becomes the rule. Parliamentary
demigods check and balance themselves. Olympian hierarchies may form,
but no single authority may sanction extralegal violence---**there is no
Schmittian category of legal exception**]{.underline}. As in the Crito,
the gods speak with the voice of the laws. Inverting Schmitt's formula,
the norm takes priority over the decision.\[3\] When the parliamentary
norm is sacred, the exceptional decision of the sovereign may not
appear. The polytheistic counter-myth sacralizes a constitutional
separation of powers within states and a balance of power between them.
Faber explains, "Even as \[Blumenberg\] condemns monotheism for its
inherent absolutism and political dualism, he pleads for polytheism on
political grounds" (182). Those outside the state are not enemies qua
unbelievers, since a polytheist might acknowledge the reality of the
Other's god(s). Polytheism allows leaders to strike a prudent balance of
power in international relations. This is the most significant payoff
for Blumenberg, who concludes that "the projection of the category of
enmity onto the relation between states is no longer a viable procedure"
in the atomic age (179). After explaining how Blumenberg responds to
Schmitt with a counter-myth, Faber pivots to critique Blumenberg for
sacralizing the status quo. At the end of his article, Faber turns
Matthew 16:25 into a scathing critique of Blumenberg's modus vivendi
pluralism: "Whoever wants merely to survive, with no thought of others,
will fail to achieve into that" (186). What kind of political theology
could inspire radicalism? Dissatisfied with Blumenberg's support for
polytheism-qua-liberalism, Faber turns to [a second alternative to
Schmitt.]{.underline} Faber is unwilling to abandon the concepts in
Schmitt's political theology that trump legal norms and sanction violent
political change. In fact, Faber wants to radicalize the state of
exception. Faber holds out hope for a political theology that will
animate class war. He shares this hope with Walter Benjamin. In Faber's
view, Benjamin makes [an immanent critique of Schmitt's categories that
does not obviate the state of exception, but rather "purifies"
it]{.underline}. Benjamin's Marxism is also secularized political
monotheology. [There may be a state of exception created by a single
divine will.]{.underline} The dispute between Benjamin and Schmitt
instead concerns the true nature of divinely sanctioned violence.
Benjamin insists that the real state of exception is no mere putsch. In
the "Critique of Violence," Benjamin disambiguates divine violence from
myth and law-formation.\[4\] For Benjamin, [the only pure divine
violence is eschatological hope, an "emergency brake" on the atomic
age.]{.underline} Schmitt's state of exception, as the basis of law and
state power, is a historical norm. The true exception is eschatological
divine violence. Benjamin rethinks the political motivations for
Marxism, and this rethinking leads him to work within the terms of
Schmitt's political theology. Unlike Marx, Benjamin seeks the political
motivation for revolution in "carrying out the demands which the past
still makes on the present" (177). Blumenberg's project---according a
legitimate distinctiveness to the modern age---is a mistake, one that
Benjamin says Marxists have made before. Faber endorses Benjamin's
argument: to draw political motivation solely from the image of Marxism
as the savior of future generations threatens "cutting the sinews of
\[the working class's\] greatest strength . . . its hatred and its
spirit of sacrifice, for both are nourished by the image of enslaved
ancestors rather than that of liberated grandchildren" (177)

### No political theology - Realism

#### Realism is no longer based off political theology.

**Guilhot 10 --** (Nicolas Guilhot, senior researcher at the CNRS and
visiting scholar at NYU, "American Katechon: When Political Theology
Became International Relations Theory",

Ultimately, this paper suggests that "realism" in international
relations is premised on a critique of secularism. In terms that were
often indirect, but in no case uncertain, [the founding fathers of IR
theory located in the process of secularization the root cause of the
moral abstractions that had led international politics into the
disasters of the 20th century. In doing so, they were faithful disciples
of Schmitt. The political was not, and could not be, the instantiation
of the universal, lest it would result in total wars waged in the name
of "humanity" or "civilization."]{.underline} Nothing indeed is more
remote from realism than the imperial language of morality and universal
rights. As its further development would show, realism was indeed a
weapon against both the progressive and the imperial tendencies of
liberalism. Realists found in a loosely articulated political theology
the bulwark against the dangers associated with the claims of moral
self-sufficiency characteristic of a political modernity in which they
discerned a worrying replacement of politics with technology, a
fundamental indifference for values, and the incapacity to discriminate
and make political decisions. The realist insistence on concrete
situations, on the material dimensions of power, and on the necessarily
limited nature of political aims, did not so much express a simplistic
view of politics as it emphasized the finite nature of the political
against the backdrop of an eschatological fulfillment of human history
that was beyond its reach. The fundamental concern defining realism was
to ensure that the imperative of the political decision could be
fulfilled even in the absence of absolute justifications, or rather
especially in their absence, since such justifications are not available
to human political practice. In that sense, [realism was indeed premised
on a political theology. But this theological moment came rapidly an end
when, under the pressure of the behavioral revolution and the
development of the social sciences, IR would be mainstreamed and
gradually reintegrated into the social science disciplines. The
anthropological and theological assumptions of early realism would be
turned into an immanent feature of the world system. It was no longer
needed to postulate the "evilness" of man, his original sin or finite
and imperfect nature, since the structure of the international arena --
the so-called security dilemma -- made him behave "as if " he was evil
and imperfect.]{.underline} John Herz' Kenneth [Waltz's major
contribution to the discipline was]{.underline} certainly to secularize
its core hypotheses by [turning theological premises into a structure of
the saeculum.]{.underline}

### 2AC - AT: Kahn

#### Kahn's ideas aren't applicable to the legal system.

**Ackerman 12** -- (John Wolfe Ackerman, Ph.D. Candidate in Political
Science, Northwestern University, "Why Political Theology Again?

Concept of Sovereignty and Sacred Violence: Torture, Terror, and
Sovereignty",

[Kahn\'s choice of political theology]{.underline} - which he so
insistently maintains is merely a neutral, non-normative effort at
description of American \"political culture\" - rules out other more
critical possibilities. It [is]{.underline} also [not]{.underline}
necessarily a [good]{.underline} description: [American society is far
too pluralistic to be adequately captured by an account of the American
sovereign\'s power to conscript citizens into the work of killing, even
if this power is an awesome one. Its location is also more ambiguous
than Kahn would have it: his appeal to the hijacked passenger plane as
an example of the realization of universal conscription]{.underline},1
10 [for example, hardly attests to a unified state or nation-centered
sovereignty.]{.underline} And one could argue against Kahn that
[America\'s continual worldwide recourse to armed and deadly military
intervention is evidence not of the sacredness with which such killing
is endowed, but rather of **the all too profane combination of
normalization, disinterest, and profit-seeking** that makes such
\"operations\" continuously possible in the first place and makes it
possible to overlook the lasting consequences for those involved in the
killing \"on both sides.\"]{.underline} Rather than simply providing the
American soldiers who kill and get killed (over ever-repeated \"tours of
duty\" - the banality of this language is telling) with the kind of
\"ultimate meaning\" that Kahn romantically anticipates (by, albeit,
reducing what they do to \"killing and being killed,\" in his refrain),
it leaves many of those who are not killed instead searching for ways to
get on at all as members of an American society from which they remain
alienated, even after a return to civilian life (and which for the
extremely high number of veteran suicides finds a futile and very
unsacred end).111 It is not that Kahn does not see this aspect of war -
Sacred Violence contains a lucid analysis of what the returning soldier
must be prevented from speaking about and of how he or she will be
turned into a scapegoat to preserve the war\'s symbolism if necessary -
but that he thinks there can be, quite simply, no state, no sovereignty,
no politics that does not entail successfully covering it up. 113 In
this case, \"political theology\" of the Kahnian variety would at least
have the distinct merit of revealing what \"politics\" itself
necessarily disguises. \"\[N\]ot law, but exception; not judge, but
sovereign; not reason, but decision. The inversion is so extreme that we
might think of political theology as the dialectical negation of liberal
political theory,\" Kahn declares, somewhat triumphantly, in opening his
discussion of Schmitt\'s Political Theology - following his series of
attempts, in prior books, to formulate his own modem political theology
as the antipode to liberalism without much help from Schmitt.114 Indeed,
the inversion Kahn proclaims is far too extreme to illuminate either
Schmitt\'s Political Theology or political theology in general. It is
undermined, not strengthened, by Kahn\'s partial encounter with Schmitt,
and another political theology, one that, like Arendt\'s, proceeds
critically from the insights offered by Schmitt and his political
theology, might well draw on theology to productively erode all of these
distinctions even further. Still, Kahn\'s critiques of many contemporary
(\"liberal\") pieties are welcome, often precisely when he brazenly
rejects reigning binary distinctions that are supposed to reassure us
that there is nothing theological about our politics: the distinction
between the American penal system and Islamic Shari\'a law, 1 1 5
between combat and torture,ll6 between soldier and torture victim.117 A
crude version of Schmitt\'s conception of \"political theology\" has
dominated political theory discussions in recent years, obscuring the
possibility of political-theological alternatives and distorting
discussion of the potential implications of theology for politics.
Kahn\'s unorthodox appeal to Schmitt partly bucks this trend and, in
doing so, provides some new and unawaited insights into American
politics and jurisprudence that go beyond the Schmitt discussion of
recent years. Still, [it would be a distinct loss for the American legal
community - and]{.underline} a handicap [for efforts to address the real
challenges posed today for dominant, \"secular\" legal systems by a
multiplicity of religiously and theologically motivated practices and
ways of life - if Kahn\'s peculiar understanding of \"political
theology\" was accepted as adequately capturing the possible meanings of
this term, especially at a time when it is all too easy to believe that
appeals to theology or religion can only have authoritarian implications
for politics.]{.underline} Indeed, the relevance of political theology
for law today may well lie not in its ability to account for a
\"beyond\" to law, beginning \"where law ends,\" but rather in its
potential to call forth alternative understandings of law that are
political in ways that the appeal to theology makes newly visible.
[Kahn\'s recent writings]{.underline}, in contrast[, may in fact provide
a revealing diagnosis of a specifically American tendency to look beyond
law in order to avoid political engagement by means of a
self-sacralization that is also deeply irreligious. If they do, however,
then it is precisely in so doing that the so-called \"political
theology\" he articulates has little to say about theology and - if
politics entails, most characteristically, not killing but the
negotiation of encounters across lines of difference, including in the
face of potential risks to one\'s own well-being - has even less to say
about politics.]{.underline}

### No political theology -- not Christian

#### Political Theology focuses only on the politics embedded in Christianity, not on the Christianity in politics

**Cole 16** (Jonathan Cole has a PhD in sociology and is currently a
professor and dean at Columbia Unitverisy. "Christian Political Theology
Needs To Grow Up And Become A Real Discipline", Political Theology,

Contemporary Christian political theology presents a rather confusing
picture. A cacophony of voices offers conflicting accounts of what the
Bible says about politics and what a normative Christian attitude
towards politics ought to look like. Many of these accounts infer or
perform eisegesis on Scriptural warrants for any number of contemporary
political ideologies, movements, parties and agendas unknown to the
original authors. Many contributors evidently lack any tangible
political experience or expertise in the highly specialized areas of
public policy characteristic of contemporary politics. Moreover,
English-speaking [political theologians are almost exclusively
preoccupied with Western liberal democracy with little thought for how
their ideas might relate to Christians living in North Korea, Iran, or
Northern Nigeria. And while most political theologies propose a
normative ethic for Christian political engagement, they rarely, if
ever, test these norms with case studies of actual regimes, past or
present.]{.underline} The confusion evident in Christian political
theology is reflected in the bewildering diversity of conflicting
popular Christian attitudes towards politics. [Christians find
themselves on opposing sides of just about every major policy question.
There are Christians who earnestly believe God is self-evidently a
liberal or progressive and others who just as earnestly believe he is
self-evidently a conservative]{.underline}. I In times past God has been
variously in favor of empire, hereditary monarchy, socialism, anarchism
and fascism. In the eyes of others God is utterly disinterested in
politics. And in the eyes of yet others he is implacably opposed to all
politics. The Rationale for Political Theology At the same time[,
political theology is both unavoidable and indispensable for the
Christian and the church.]{.underline} It is unavoidable because
Scripture invites reflection on politics, everyone lives under some form
of political authority, and Christian churches occupy public space.
Scripture invites (some might say demands) reflection on politics in
several ways. Firstly, Scripture uses political concepts to articulate
theological truths. [Political concepts such as "kingship", "judgment",
"law" and "citizenship" are used in Scripture to articulate the
relationship between God and his creation]{.underline}, especially his
image-bearers. So key theological concepts, such as God's kingship,
unavoidably have implications for how the Christian views politics.
Secondly, Scripture provides a narrative of God's activities in human
history. As a consequence, Scripture contains descriptions and
interpretations of actual historical regimes and political developments,
which have a greater or lesser bearing on how many of the stories in the
Bible are interpreted. The history of God's interaction with the word,
irrespective of how it is interpreted, is inextricably intertwined with
politics. Thirdly, there are parts of Scripture that contain explicit
exhortations in relation to what we would characterize today as
politics. The most famous such passage is Romans 13:1-7: "Let every
person be subject to the governing authorities; for there is no
authority except from God, and those authorities that exist have been
instituted by God" (NRSV). [Reflection on politics is also unavoidable
for the Christian because all humans live under some form of political
authority that materially affects their lives, forcing them to think
about politics and to make judgments about how they interact with
political authorities. In fact, membership of a particular political
order is involuntary]{.underline} -- everybody is born under some form
of political authority, even illegal aliens -- [and people can only
remove themselves from a political order with great difficult, if at
all]{.underline}. So everybody, Christian and atheist alike, forms at
least some opinions about politics and has at least some interaction
with political authorities. Political theology is further unavoidable
for the fact that the church occupies public space. This is a product of
two features of Jesus' ministry: it was public and spawned a social
movement. If Jesus' ministry were not public, he would not have come to
the attention of the religious and political authorities of his day. And
if his ministry had not spawned a social movement, i.e. if he had not
gathered followers who aided and participated in his ministry, then he
likely would not have been deemed a threat by those same authorities.
These two features of Jesus' ministry remain constitutive of the church.
It is public and still functions like a social movement. As a
consequence, [churches unavoidably have a relationship with a political
order and with particular political authorities. Political theology is
indispensable for the Christian and the church today because traditional
Christian beliefs and practices are increasingly matters of public
controversy as cultural norms and attitudes]{.underline} shift. This
makes an apologetic and constructive political engagement more important
than ever for Christians. The Missing "Political" in Political Theology
[The fundamental problem with contemporary political
theology]{.underline}, and a source of the confusion that characterizes
theopolitical discourse, [is that **it is strong in theology and weak in
politics.**]{.underline} Given the importance of the concept of
"politics" for the field of political theology it is remarkable how
infrequently this central term is defined in writings on the subject.
This is no trivial point. [Political theology, after all, without the
"political" is merely theology. The failure to see the significance of
defining "politics" in political theology is indicative of a broader
disinterest in close examination of the phenomenon of "politics" by
political theologians.]{.underline} There is much analysis of what the
Bible does or doesn't say about politics, what the political
significance is or isn't of the Christ-event, and what the existence of
the church means for political authority, but often very little analysis
of 'politics' as a distinct phenomenon in its own right, i.e. its
meaning, nature and purpose in human social life and history. Thus
**[political theology is often more about]{.underline}** exegesis,
**[theology and the church than it is about politics]{.underline}**.

#### Political Theology ignores how politics function in practice, looks only at Eurocentric empirics, and does not have nearly enough scholars to be an adequate scholarship base

**Cole 16** (Jonathan Cole has a PhD in sociology and is currently a
professor and dean at Columbia Unitverisy. "Christian Political Theology

It becomes clear on closer inspection [that some of the fundamental
points of difference in political theology trace their roots back to
very different implicit conceptions of "politics"]{.underline} brought
to the interpretation of the Bible, Christian doctrine, history, and
tradition. This gives the field a degree of incoherence, as [it is not
always clear if political theologians, when they address "politics", are
actually talking about the same thing.]{.underline} Part of the problem
possibly stems from the fact that "politics" is nowhere defined in
Scripture. The terms "politics" and "political", which derive from the
Greek polis (city) or politeia, only occur rarely in in the Bible and
have the general meaning of "citizenship" or "civil administration". It
is understandable why the Biblical authors by and large did not see the
need to define politics. They were not writing treatises in political
theory[. It is]{.underline}, on the other hand, [difficult to understand
why someone engaged in political theology would see this as
unimportant.]{.underline} As a consequence, politics is studied,
discussed, and written about at a volume, regularity and degree of
publicity that political theology simply is not. Given the phenomenon
that political theologians and secular political thinkers analyze is
shared and observable, there is much to be gained from a Christian
theological engagement with secular political thought. The Challenge of
the Professionalization of Politics A great challenge for political
theology is the professionalization of contemporary politics. With a few
notable exceptions, most participants in theo-political discourse have
spent their careers in the academy, the church or a mixture of the two.
This is not a criticism per se, for this is exactly where one might
expect, or indeed wish to find, among theologians. But [in today's
technocratic world where politics is the realm of
professionals]{.underline}, whether in the form of elected
representatives, advisors, civil servants or journalists, [analyzing
politics from the sidelines can be an obstacle to understanding how
politics functions in practice.]{.underline} English philosopher Roger
Scruton in [The Meaning of
Conservatism](https://books.google.com/books?id=dwaMDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1&dq=%22the+reality+of+politics+is+action%22&source=bl&ots=6Y4LXBCBIS&sig=CdAvTYjDzhju9cS-oO4E62HezNA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjG5carq8TPAhVMwWMKHRsUB6UQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22the%20reality%20of%20politics%20is%20action%22&f=false)
perceptibly observed that "the reality of politics is action".(1) Yet
much work in political theology fails to recognize this fact.
[Theopolitical discourse has a tendency to be a rather abstract affair,
entirely unhindered by considerations of feasibility and implementation.
In some cases it is difficult to even discern whether a theopolitical
proposal has any practical implications for political action at
all]{.underline}. Meanwhile, political decisions are inexorably made
daily. Just consider for a moment the criticism presidents and
governments come under for perceived inaction, indecisiveness or undue
delay in decision-making. That is not to suggest that thinking about
politics is unimportant. Scruton did not just say that politics is
action. He also highlighted that thought governs action. So the way we
think about politics is inextricably linked to political action.
[Political theolo]{.underline}gy is not wrong therefore to pay attention
to how Christians ought to think about politics. It [could]{.underline}
[however do a better job of relating Christian **political thought** to
Christian **political action.**]{.underline} There is, of course, no
shortage of professional Christian politicians, advisors, officials and
journalists. But they are rarely professional theologians, and generally
do not engage in political theology. [We have]{.underline}, therefore,
on the one hand [political theologians with little to no experience or
expertise in the profession of politics, and]{.underline}, on the other
hand, [Christian political professionals with little to no theological
training.]{.underline} There would be great mutual benefit in bringing
these two worlds into deeper conversation. A related challenge for
political theology is the sheer complexity and specialization of
policy-formulation and implementation in modern nation-states. People
spend whole careers developing expertise in specific areas of public
policy through study, research and professional experience. The
political theologian, meanwhile, who has a host of non-political duties,
obligations and commitments, often lacks the opportunity and resources
to develop any real level of expertise in specific areas of public
policy, whether through work or study. Political theologians could
address this gap by making the effort to better acquaint themselves with
some areas of public policy. The political theologian, for example,
could test their theories or proposed norms by studying a particular
policy area in consultation with experts and political professionals
with relevant experience. A Disregard for Political [History Another
weakness of political theology is its surprising lack of interest in
political history. If political theologians take account of political
history]{.underline} at all, [they generally do so with a parochial
focus on the history of Israel]{.underline}, [the first century
Greco-Roman world, Christendom]{.underline} (Byzantine political history
and political thought is entirely ignored in English-speaking political
theology) [the Enlightenment and liberal democracy.]{.underline} [Other
historical regimes and civilizations are generally ignored or treated
superficially]{.underline}. The significance of the aforementioned
historical matrix needs no justification for the political theologian
writing in English, as it expresses the genealogy of their political
context. [But is this really a sufficiently deep and broad basis upon
which to draw normative conclusions about politics given its universal
character? Political history begins well before the emergence of
Israel]{.underline}. Both Egypt and Sumer had established and reasonably
developed political orders when they adopted the systematic use of
writing in the fourth millennium BC, marking the beginning of recorded
history. Systematic analysis of politics began in fifth century Greece.
Moreover, Christian reflection on politics is not the only species of
political theology. There is a long parallel Islamic tradition of
reflection on politics[. The point is]{.underline} not that Christian
political theology has some sort of obligation to look outside its own
history and Scripture for its political concepts and norms. It is to
suggest, rather, that [Christian political theology could become much
more intellectually rigorous if it broadened its horizon to include the
political history of regimes that fall outside sacred
history.]{.underline} The Problem of Critical Mass [A final challenge
for political theology is the lack of critical mass in scholarship on
the topic. Political theology is still a relatively marginal
sub-discipline of theology and hardly a staple on the syllabus of the
average theology school]{.underline}, or seminary. In fact, one of the
most prominent and influential political theologians, Oliver O'Donovan,
once described political theology in his Bampton lectures entitled [The
Ways of
Judgment](https://books.google.com/books?id=tOZdcOl4UaAC&pg=PR9&lpg=PR9&dq=Oliver+O%27Donovan+political+theology+pseudo-discipline&source=bl&ots=CQxNd9y1pO&sig=g_cXuTqzAVyLrTdklbH9bngZoTY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjIiNv1rsTPAhUKHGMKHbjmB3EQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=Oliver%20O%27Donovan%20political%20theology%20pseudo-discipline&f=false)
as a "pseudo-discipline". [Recognizing that political theology is in
many respects still in its infancy as a discipline can help us to place
existing contributions into context]{.underline}. Key contributions to
the field, dating back to the 1970s, deserve to be regarded as
pioneering works. They are the first fruits of theologians who beat a
path from the comfortable confines of theology into the dense, wild
jungle of politics. We therefore owe a debt of gratitude to the likes of
John Howard Yoder (Mennonite), Reinhold Niebuhr (Reformed), Oliver
O'Donovan (Anglican), Johannes B. Metz (Catholic) and Christos Yannaras
(Orthodox), to name but a few, for beating the path. But it is time to
pave the paths trodden by these pioneers to enable high-volume traffic
and trade to proceed. Conclusion Given Scripture and the nature of the
church demand some level of thought about politics, and given the fact
that we all inescapably have to interact to some degree with a political
order, the choice confronting the Christian is not between a political
theology and no political theology. Rather, it is between a robust
political theology and a weak political theology. [A robust political
theology requires deeper reflection on politics qua politics than is
commonly the case in theopolitical discourse. It also requires deeper
engagement with secular political thought and political history, as well
as with the practical art of politics]{.underline}. That is achievable.
But it requires political theology to transition to a full-blown, bona
fide discipline. [Such a transition depends on a greater number of
aspiring or established theologians choosing political theology as a
vocation, and then dedicating themselves to the long study of politics
required to develop true expertise in the field]{.underline}. This in
turn requires theology schools and seminaries to invest greater
resources in political theology in recognition that it ought to be
regarded as an essential component of a contemporary theological
education fit for helping the church to confront its new and rapidly
developing political context.

During the second half of the 17th century, a terrible transformation,
the enslavement of people solely on the basis of race, occurred in the
lives of African Americans living in North America. These newcomers
still numbered only a few thousand, but the bitter reversals they
experienced---first subtle, then drastic---would shape the lives of all
those who followed them, generation after generation[. Like most huge
changes, the imposition of hereditary race slavery was gradual, taking
hold by degrees over many decades.]{.underline} It proceeded slowly, in
much the same way that winter follows fall. On any given day, in any
given place, people can argue about local weather conditions. "Is it
getting colder?" "Will it warm up again this week?" The shift may come
early in some places, later in others. [But eventually, it occurs all
across the land.]{.underline} By January, people shiver and think back
to September, agreeing that "it is definitely colder now." [In 1700, a
70-year-old African American could look back half a century to 1650 and
shiver, knowing that conditions had definitely changed for the
worse.]{.underline} Some people had experienced the first cold winds of
enslavement well before 1650; others would escape the chilling blast
well after 1700. **[The timing and nature of the change varied
considerably from colony to colony, and even from family to family.
Gradually, the terrible transformation took on a momentum of its own,
numbing and burdening everything in its path,]{.underline}** like a
disastrous winter storm. Unlike the changing seasons, however, **[the
encroachment of racial slavery in the colonies of North America was
certainly not a natural process.]{.underline}** It was highly
unnatural---the work of powerful competitive governments and many
thousands of human beings spread out across the Atlantic world. [Nor was
it inevitable that people's legal status would come to depend upon their
racial background and that the condition of slavery would be passed down
from parent to child.]{.underline} **[Numerous factors combined to bring
about this disastrous shift]{.underline}**---human forces swirled
together during the decades after 1650, to create an enormously
destructive storm. By 1650, hereditary enslavement based upon color, not
upon religion, was a bitter reality in the older Catholic colonies of
the New World. In the Caribbean and Latin America, for well over a
century, Spanish and Portuguese colonizers had enslaved "infidels":
first Indians and then Africans. [At first, they relied for
justification upon the Mediterranean tradition that persons of a
different religion, or persons captured in war, could be enslaved for
life]{.underline}. **[But hidden in this idea of slavery was the notion
that persons who converted to Christianity should receive their
freedom]{.underline}.** Wealthy planters in the tropics, afraid that
their cheap labor would be taken away from them because of this
loophole, changed the reasoning behind their exploitation. Even persons
who could prove that they were not captured in war and that they
accepted the Catholic faith still could not change their appearance, any
more than a leopard can change its spots. [So by making color the key
factor behind enslavement, dark-skinned people brought from Africa to
work in silver mines and on sugar plantations could be exploited for
life]{.underline}. Indeed, the servitude could be made hereditary, so
enslaved people's children automatically inherited the same unfree
status. But this cruel and self-perpetuating system had not yet taken
firm hold in North America. The same anti-Catholic propaganda that had
led Sir Francis Drake to liberate Negro slaves in Central America in the
1580s still prompted many colonists to believe that it was the
Protestant mission to convert non-Europeans rather than enslave them.
[Apart from such moral concerns, there were simple matters of cost and
practicality. Workers subject to longer terms and coming from further
away would require a larger initial investment]{.underline}. Consider a
1648 document from York County, Virginia, showing the market values for
persons working for James Stone (estimated in terms of pounds of
tobacco): Francis Bomley for 6 yeares 1500 John Thackstone for 3 yeares
1300 Susan Davis for 3 yeares 1000 Emaniell a Negro man 2000 Roger Stone
3 yeares 1300 Mingo a Negro man 2000 [Among all six, Susan had the
lowest value. She may have been less strong in the tobacco field, and as
a woman she ran a greater risk of early death because of the dangers of
childbirth. Hence John and Roger, the other English servants with
three-year terms, commanded a higher value. F]{.underline}rancis, whose
term was twice as long, was not worth twice as much. Life expectancy was
short for everyone in early Virginia, so he might not live to complete
his term. The two black workers, Emaniell and Mingo, clearly had longer
terms, perhaps even for life, and they also had the highest value. If
they each lived for another 20 years, they represented a bargain for Mr.
Stone, but [if they died young, perhaps even before they had fully
learned the language, their value as workers proved far
less]{.underline}. From Stone's point of view they represented a risky
and expensive investment at best. By 1650, however, conditions were
already beginning to change. For one thing, both the Dutch and the
English had started using enslaved Africans to produce sugar in the
Caribbean and the tropics. English experiments at Barbados and
Providence Island showed that Protestant investors could easily overcome
their moral scruples. Large profits could be made if foreign rivals
could be held in check. After agreeing to peace with Spain and giving up
control of Northeast Brazil at midcentury, Dutch slave traders were
actively looking for new markets. In England, after Charles II was
restored to the throne in 1660, he rewarded supporters by creating the
Royal African Co. to enter aggressively into the slave trade. The
English king also chartered a new colony in Carolina. He hoped it would
be close enough to the Spanish in Florida and the Caribbean to challenge
them in economic and military terms. Many of the first English settlers
in Carolina after 1670 came from Barbados. [They brought enslaved
Africans with them. They also brought the beginnings of a legal code and
a social system that accepted race slavery. While new colonies with a
greater acceptance of race slavery were being founded, the older
colonies continued to grow.]{.underline} Early in the 17th century no
tiny North American port could absorb several hundred workers arriving
at one time on a large ship. Most Africans---such as those reaching
Jamestown in 1619---arrived several dozen at a time aboard small boats
and privateers from the Caribbean. Like Emaniell and Mingo on the farm
of James Stone, they tended to mix with other unfree workers on small
plantations. All of these servants, no matter what their origin, could
hope to obtain their own land and the personal independence that goes
with private property. In 1645, in Northampton County on Virginia's
Eastern Shore, Captain Philip Taylor, after complaining that "Anthony
the negro" did not work hard enough for him, agreed to set aside part of
the cornfield where they worked as Anthony's plot. "I am very glad of
it," the black man told a local clerk, "now I know myne owne ground and
I will worke when I please and play when I please." Anthony and Mary
Johnson had also gained their own property in Northampton County before
1650. He had arrived in Virginia in 1621, aboard the James and was cited
on early lists as "Antonio a Negro." He was put to work on the tobacco
plantation of Edward Bennett, with more than 50 other people. All except
five were killed the following March, when local Indians struck back
against the foreigners who were invading their land. Antonio was one of
the lucky survivors. He became increasingly English in his ways,
eventually gaining his freedom and moving to the Eastern Shore, where he
was known as Anthony Johnson. Along the way, he married "Mary a Negro
Woman," who had arrived in 1622 aboard the Margrett and John, and they
raised at least four children, gaining respect for their "hard labor and
known service," according to the court records of Northampton County. By
the 1650s, Anthony and Mary Johnson owned a farm of 250 acres, and their
married sons, John and Richard, farmed adjoining tracts of 450 and 100
acres respectively. In the 1660s, the whole Johnson clan pulled up
stakes and moved north into Maryland, where the aging Anthony leased a
300-acre farm called "Tonies Vineyard" until his death. His widow Mary,
in her will of 1672, distributed a cow to each of her grandsons,
including John Jr., the son of John and Susanna Johnson. Five years
later, when John Jr. purchased a 44-acre farm for himself, he named the
homestead Angola, which suggests that his grandparents had been born in
Africa and had kept alive stories of their homeland within the family.
But within 30 years, John Jr. had died without an heir, and the entire
Johnson family had disappeared from the colonial records. If we knew
their fate, it might tell us more about the terrible transformation that
was going on around them. **[Gradually, it was becoming harder to obtain
English labor in the mainland colonies. Civil war and a great plague
reduced England's population, and the Great Fire of London created fresh
demands for workers at home.]{.underline}** Stiff penalties were imposed
on sea captains who grabbed young people in England and sold them in the
colonies as indentured servants. (This common practice was given a new
name: "kidnapping.") English servants already at work in the colonies
demanded shorter indentures, better working conditions, and suitable
farmland when their contracts expired. Officials feared they would lose
future English recruits to rival colonies if bad publicity filtered back
to Europe, so they could not ignore this pressure, even when it
undermined colonial profits. Nor could colonial planters turn instead to
Indian labor. Native Americans captured in frontier wars continued to be
enslaved, but each act of aggression by European colonists made future
diplomacy with neighboring Indians more difficult. Native American
captives could easily escape into the familiar wilderness and return to
their original tribe. Besides, their numbers were limited. [African
Americans, in contrast, were thousands of miles from their homeland, and
their availability increased as the scope of the Atlantic slave trade
expanded. More European countries competed to transport and exploit
African labor; more West African leaders proved willing to engage in
profitable trade with them; more New World planters had the money to
purchase new workers from across the ocean.]{.underline} It seemed as
though every decade the ships became larger, the contacts more regular,
the departures more frequent, the routes more familiar, the sales more
efficient. [As the size and efficiency of this brutal traffic increased,
so did its rewards for European investors]{.underline}. Their ruthless
competition pushed up the volume of transatlantic trade from Africa
anddrove down the relative cost of individual Africans in the New World
at a time when the price of labor from Europe was rising. As their
profits increased, slave merchants and their captains continued to look
for fresh markets. North America, on the fringe of this expanding and
infamous Atlantic system, represented a likely target. As the small
mainland colonies grew and their trade with one another and with England
increased, their capacity to purchase large numbers of new laborers from
overseas expanded. By the end of the century, Africans were arriving
aboard large ships directly from Africa as well as on smaller boats from
the West Indies. In 1698, the monopoly held by England's Royal African
Co. on this transatlantic business came to an end, and independent
traders from England and the colonies stepped up their voyages,
intending to capture a share of the profits. [All these large and
gradual changes would still not have brought about the terrible
transformation to race slavery, had it not been for several other
crucial factors. One ingredient was the mounting fear among colonial
leaders regarding signs of discontent and cooperation among poor and
unfree colonists of all sorts]{.underline}. Europeans and Africans
worked together, intermarried, ran away together, and shared common
resentments toward the well-to-do. **[Both groups were involved in a
series of bitter strikes and servant uprisings among tobacco pickers in
Virginia, culminating in an open rebellion in 1676.]{.underline}**
[Greatly outnumbered by these armed workers, authorities were quick to
sense the need to divide their labor force in order to control
it.]{.underline} Stressing cultural and ethnic divisions would be one
way to do that. Lifetime servitude could be enforced only by removing
the prospect that a person might gain freedom through Christian
conversion. [One approach was to outlaw this traditional route to
freedom. As early as 1664, a Maryland statute specified that Christian
baptism could have no effect upon the legal status of a
slave.]{.underline} A more sweeping solution, however, involved removing
religion altogether as a factor in determining servitude. Therefore,
another fundamental key to the terrible transformation was the shift
from changeable spiritual faith to unchangeable physical appearance as a
measure of status[. Increasingly, the dominant English came to view
Africans not as "heathen people" but as "black people." They began, for
the first time, to describe themselves not as Christians but as
whites.]{.underline} And they gradually wrote this shift into their
colonial laws. Within a generation, the English definition of who could
be made a slave had shifted from someone who was not a Christian to
someone who was not European in appearance. Indeed, the transition for
self-interested Englishmen went further. It was a small but momentous
step from saying that black persons could be enslaved to saying that
Negroes should be enslaved. One Christian minister was dismayed by this
rapid change to slavery based on race: "These two words, Negro and
Slave" wrote the Rev. Morgan Godwyn in 1680, are "by custom grown
Homogeneous and Convertible"---that is, interchangeable.

II\. THE NEUROLOGICAL BASIS OF RACE AND THE ROLE OF CULTURAL DIVERSITY
[Psychological and neuroscientific evidence further evidences America\'s
socially and legally constructed racial hierarchy]{.underline}. (115)
Psychological studies demonstrate that [Americans explicitly rank whites
higher than Asians, Asians higher than Hispanics, and Hispanics higher
than blacks. (]{.underline}116) Implicit bias tests demonstrate that the
\"hierarchy of implicit evaluations placed the in-group at the top,
followed by Whites, Asians, Blacks, and then Hispanics.\" (117) Explicit
and implicit biases explain all elements of the racial hierarchy
discussed herein\--from political decisions to employment realities.
(118) **[Neurological science now confirms the social psychology of
race]{.underline}**. Specifically, [scientists **used functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)** to track brain activity and
associate neural activity in specific parts of the brain with responses
to implicit association tests.]{.underline} (119) [In particular,
scientists find that amygdala activity]{.underline} [(a part of the
brain]{.underline} previously **[identified in emotional, fear and
threat assessment)]{.underline}** (120) [is triggered when implicit
biases take hold in response to racialized images]{.underline}. (121)
Consequently, neuroscience confirms the validity of implicit
associations tests that demonstrate the attitudes underlying America\'s
racial hierarchy. (122) The neurological responses to racialized stimuli
that underlie implicit association tests do not arise innately. Instead,
**[neuroscience demonstrates that the amygdala activity requires social
conditioning from a young age.]{.underline}** (123) Indeed, [the
amygdala]{.underline} itself [develops rapidly during **adolescence in
response to social environment**]{.underline}. (124) Thus, [when
neuroscientists assessed]{.underline} amygdala [activity in response to
racialized stimuli across development ages ranging from 4 to 16.5,
**they found an absence of such activity in early childhood,** and
**substantial activity in adolescents**.]{.underline} (125) This
suggests that racial responses are learned responses. (126) In fact,
neuroscientists also found that [amygdala response is mitigated by
cultural diversity among peers]{.underline}. (127)
[Diversity]{.underline} (independent of age) within a child\'s peer
group [predicted diminished amygdala activation]{.underline} to
interracial faces. (128) The [authors]{.underline} therefore [recommend
\"interventions designed to reduce the development of racial biases
could focus on providing children with opportunities to interact with
individuals from diverse backgrounds, thereby **potentially decreasing
the salience of race.\"**]{.underline} (129) Neuroscience also suggests
that [these processes influence empathy]{.underline}. Using functional
magnetic resonance imaging, [scientists scanned twenty Chinese adults
with significant life experiences in Western nations with majority
Caucasian populations as they viewed videotapes.]{.underline} (130) The
[videos depicted]{.underline} either [Asian or Caucasian models in
painful or non-painful stimulations]{.underline}. (131) The scientists
concluded: We found that the [neural activity in the pain
matrix]{.underline} including the anterior cingulate cortex, anterior
insula, inferior frontal cortex and somatosensory cortex [was
significantly increased in response to painful versus non-painful
stimuli]{.underline} applied to both Asian and Caucasian models.
Moreover, these [empathic neural responses to Asian and Caucasian models
did not differ significantly and were positively correlated with each
other]{.underline}. Our results indicate that [cultural
experiences]{.underline} with racial out-group members [may
increase]{.underline} the [neural responses to the suffering of
other-race individuals]{.underline} and thus reduce the racial bias in
empathy. (132) Naturally, this kind of interracial empathy, now
pinpointed to arise from significant experiences with culturally diverse
people, likely influences a range of political issues subject to citizen
decisionmaking. (133) [The key to overcoming racial bias demonstrated in
these neurological studies, and thus overcoming much of our racial
hierarchy, would appear to be **maximizing the presence of cultural
diversity** throughout our society as well as the **exposure of all
citizens to the broadest degree of cultural diversity.**]{.underline}

#### Understanding [neuroscience]{.underline} is a prereq to [coherent understandings]{.underline} of [social psychology]{.underline} 

**Serrat 10**. (Olivier Serrat, Doctoral Student at The Chicago School

[Human history is not only social history but also **neurobiological
history**]{.underline}**.** Throughout most of the 20th century, social
and biological explanations were widely viewed as incompatible. However,
from the 1990s, the emergence of social neuroscience6 vindicates
Aristotle's pioneering deductions. [The young science accepts that the
brain is a single, pivotal component of an undeniably social species and
that it is orderly in its complexity.]{.underline} **[It treats the
human brain as a social organ]{.underline}**, whose physiological and
neurological reactions are directly and profoundly shaped by social
interaction. (To a mammal, being socially connected to caregivers is
indispensable for survival: this, incidentally, suggests that Abraham
Maslow's hierarchy of needs might need to be revised to ascribe more
weight to social needs, e.g., love and belonging, and esteem, in
relation to self-actualization.) [Nondualistic and nonreductionistic,
social neuroscience, through a multilevel and integrative approach,
**aims to understand the role of the central nervous system** in the
formation and maintenance of social behaviors and
processes.]{.underline} Spanning the social and biological domains,
e.g., molecular, cellular, system, person, relational, collective, and
societal, it exploits biological concepts and neurobiological techniques
such as functional magnetic resonance imaging7 ---which measures
patterns of blood oxygenation responses in the brain as a subject
engages in a particular task, to inform and refine theories of social
behavior. In short, it focuses on how the brain mediates social
interaction.8 (Brain scans captured through functional magnetic
resonance imaging show that the same areas are associated with distress,
be that caused by social rejection or by physical pain.) Arguably,
**[the potential benefits of social neuroscience are that it can inform
debates in social psychology, provide tools for measuring brain--body
activity directly and unobtrusively and provide information that would
be impossible to assess using other techniques,]{.underline}** and
permit the examination of social processes by pointing to the importance
of social variables (from context to culture) in altering processes
within the brain and body.

### Prefer Neuroscience -- CTP 

#### Trumpism is the result of [constant exposure to antagonistic images and messages]{.underline} -- the libinal economy is [false,]{.underline} but [ceding the political]{.underline} allows [more right-wing echo chambers]{.underline} like Fox News to [proliferate]{.underline}

[An important factor in the rise of Trumpism]{.underline} and other
types of extreme right-wing politics [is that]{.underline} the brains of
[conservatives are hardwired to over-respond to fear]{.underline} and
other threats. The [brains of conservative-authoritarians also
demonstrate a negativity bias]{.underline}. Anxiety biases our visual
attention. Studies have shown that [people with anxiety tend to focus
more on either real or perceived threats in their
environment.]{.underline} And it doesn\'t even have to \[be\] an actual
threat. What some people would see as a neutral stimulus, other people
would see as a threat. In research it has been shown that [even
millisecond differences of focusing on threats longer]{.underline}
[than]{.underline}, say, a [non-anxious person]{.underline} would
experience \[the same threat\] [builds up over time. **In total, this
creates a misperception of \[an\] environment being more threatening
than it actually is. This is a type of loop which perpetuates
anxiety.**]{.underline} Conservatives on average --- not all of them ---
but on average show that type of threat-related bias. There is much in
common between conservatives and anxious people. And **[this makes sense
given their ideology and the types of messages that are being fed to
them through the right-wing echo chamber and powerful outlets such as
Fox News]{.underline}**. Having a heightened response to fear is not
necessarily a bad thing. For example, if something bad happens, a
hyper-vigilant person might be better prepared to handle the situation
because they are anticipating it. These traits evolved over time to help
us respond to threats. This was obviously long before television and
video games and other types of media. [Through]{.underline} the [TV news
and other media, human beings,]{.underline} especially in this culture,
[are being bombarded by a mountain of emotionally charged stimuli**. Now
the threat and anxiety response is not always adaptive
anymore**]{.underline}. It may sometimes not be the appropriate
response. [That type of bias can result in irrational
behavior]{.underline}. There is a lingering and incorrect narrative that
Trump won the White House because of \"white working class anxiety.\"
Research by social scientists and others has demolished that fiction.
Trump won because of racial animus if not outright racism among his
voters. What does the research reveal about the relationship between
brain structure and racial animus? [There are implicit and explicit
racial biases]{.underline}. Those biases have neural correlates.
Therefore, [almost all of us have an implicit racial bias, which is
unconscious in many cases]{.underline}. It is largely innocuous.
Moreover, fixed implicit biases do not always translate into explicit
racism and overt racist behavior. That [move from implicit to explicit
racial bias has a great deal to do with what is going on at the neural
level]{.underline}. **[Implicit bias is associated with a structure in
the brain called the amygdala; this part of the brain is known to be
involved in the processing of emotional and other salient
stimuli.]{.underline}** [When we visually process something that causes
fear]{.underline}, that [feeling is related to]{.underline} a surge of
[activation in the amygdala]{.underline}. This is a normal response. But
[when there is an exaggerated response in the amygdala, one that is not
attenuated by other brain areas such as emotional regulation and impulse
control, then our sense of fear can manifest itself as prejudiced ideas
and behaviors]{.underline}. In a healthy functioning brain, an area
called the prefrontal cortex, which is slower acting, slows the amygdala
response and in essence says to a person, \"hey, there\'s no rational
reason to fear this or to feel angry.\" One could really conclude that
[explicit racism is often the result of an impaired prefrontal cortex
response.]{.underline} Understanding racism on the neural level is very
important. Racism and racial animus manifest are omnipresent in American
society. What do we know about the neurological and cognitive dimensions
of overt malignant racists --- for example neo-Nazis, Kluxers and other
members of the \"alt-right\" --- as compared to the biology and behavior
of people who manifest other more day-to-day quotidian types of racism?
Never mind internalized racism by nonwhites. That is a phenomenon that
has not really been explored in much depth. Given your observation about
racial minorities, there have actually been studies which show that some
African-Americans actually manifest implicit bias where they are faster
to categorize words as negative in a computer task when it follows a
black face as compared to a white face. So yes, these biases are
widespread. It is something that we have to bring an awareness to as a
society. Everyone should know that they have these racial biases because
there are many people in denial of these facts about themselves.

## Liberalism Good

### 2AC - Liberalism Good -- Combats Oppression

#### General prosperity benefits everyone, liberalist policies are the only way to achieve this

**Rosenfelder 12** (Mark Rosenfelder is an American author and linguist
who graduated from Northwestern University. He has authored books and
articles on many subjects, politics and sociology included. "Liberalism
works, and why it beats plutocracy", 2012, Accessed 7/18/19,
https://www.zompist.com/liberalism.html)//grf

My earlier page made the case that, [if you want everyone in the country
to be better off, liberalism is the best policy]{.underline}. No mere
collection of facts can make that if into an imperative. But this moral
principle can: [you **should** want everyone]{.underline} in the country
[to be better off. The alternative is that you don\'t want everyone to
be better off.]{.underline} Objections tend to be of two kinds: You
think only people like you should be better off. Points for honesty, I
guess, but a desire to hurt people unlike you is ugly. Besides, as the
pragmatics page showed, [general prosperity benefits
everyone]{.underline}. A desire to hold back your own prosperity simply
to keep others from gaining is\... baffling. You think general
prosperity is less important than something else--- piety, sexual
propriety, depth of culture, order, the rights of property owners. These
sentiments may be genuine, but they\'re generally an attempt to
whitewash the previous category--- the assumption is that the disfavored
classes are less religious, more licentious, stupider, more dangerous.
They aren\'t, but if it worries you, prosperity is an effective
assimilator. There are subtler objections, such as the worry that
general prosperity will overburden the planet. That\'s a great concern,
but orthogonal to the question. The answer to environmental crisis is
not "more inequality!" (A few people read my earlier page and thought it
was about utilitarianism. Liberalism goes beyond that, but to head off a
misunderstanding, it definitely isn\'t the straw man version of
utilitarianism--- i.e. "the ends justify the means." Liberals are very
much into common morality and the rule of law, which is why we are so
disappointing to revolutionaries. Injustice is disgusting Story time I
doubt many people join a movement because they\'ve read its manifesto.
Though modern liberalism started with the New Deal, its heart is the
civil rights movement. To explain the appeal, I\'m going to have to tell
some stories. In 1951, a black family headed by Harvey Clark, a WW2
veteran and a university graduate, rented an apartment in Cicero,
Illinois--- a couple miles southeast of here, in fact. He was hassled
and beat up by police officers as he tried to move in. He successfully
sued to keep the police from preventing the move. Then came the
three-day riot, in which 4000 whites mobbed his apartment building,
threw stones, destroyed the family\'s possessions, and finally set fire
to the building. Clark himself most regretted the destruction of his
piano, which he had bought for his daughter by working overtime. Or
there\'s the case of Malcolm Little. While his mother was still pregnant
with him, Klansmen surrounded their house and broke all the windows. His
father and three of his uncles were killed by white men, one by a lynch
mob. His home in Nebraska was burned by another mob. Malcolm\'s early
childhood was hard, but he did very well in high school--- he got top
grades and was elected class president. One of his teachers asked him
what he might do for a career. Malcolm answered that he thought he might
like to be a lawyer. The teacher smiled and told him "A lawyer---
that\'s no realistic goal for a nigger." He suggested carpentry. Not
surprisingly, Malcolm decided that the white man\'s world was a
conspiracy to prevent black progress, enforced with smiles at the top
and terrorism at the bottom. Under those circumstances, why not turn to
crime? He did, but later he got religion and changed his name to X.
August Wilson tells a story about his mother. There was a trivia contest
on the radio, in the \'50s, where the prize was a new washing machine---
something she sorely needed. She knew the answer, called in, and won the
prize. But when they learned that she was black, they wouldn\'t give it
to her. They proposed giving her a gift certificate to the Salvation
Army instead; she could get a used machine there. Or Commissioner Bull
Connor in Birmingham, who used attack dogs and fire hoses against
peaceful demonstrators led by pastor Martin Luther King Jr (1963). King
was a Christian minister, and advocated non-violence and even
non-resistance to violent provocation; four years later, he was
murdered. During the Birmingham campaign, the 16th Street Baptist Church
was bombed, killing four teenage girls. The Klansman who did it was
found not guilty, though he was fined for possession of dynamite without
a permit. Clyde Ross grew up in Mississippi, where the law was
unavailable to blacks, and whites simply stole any black wealth they
wanted. (Ross had a horse when he was ten. White men took it from him.)
Ross moved his family to Chicago in 1947, where he could vote and get a
house. Regular mortgages weren\'t given to blacks; instead an operator
got him a contract house--- where the householder was responsible for
all upkeep, but could lose the house if he missed a single payment. It
was federal policy to deny ordinary mortgages to blacks. James Zwerg, a
white divinity student, was one of the Freedom Riders who in 1961 rode
segregated buses and refused to sit in the back of the bus. They were
met by a mob in Montgomery; Zwerg was held against the wall by a group
of men while men punched him and women clawed his face. Some women held
up their toddlers so the little ones could attack him too. Fannie Lou
Hamer was a black woman who dared to register to vote. She was thrown
off the plantation where she lived; when she stayed with a friend she
was shot at; her house was assessed a \$9000 water bill though it had no
running water; she was arrested, beaten savagely, and sexually molested
in jail. Nichelle Nichols was once kicked out of a hotel in Salt Lake
City, where she had a reservation, for being black. She couldn\'t find
another hotel, either--- she found a family to stay with. When she was
working on Star Trek, the guard at one gate in the studio lot wouldn\'t
let her in, for being black. It\'s really really low to mess with Lt.
Uhura. Multiply by 23 million. Liberals think this is no way to treat
people. But it goes way beyond that. Some researchers claim that
liberals aren\'t motivated by feeling of moral disgust, but I disagree.
Liberals think incidents like these are disgusting. [Racism is
viscerally wrong, it\'s unacceptable, and it needs to stop]{.underline}.
Plus, we think it\'s un-American. Hard work and ambition and service to
your country are supposed to be rewarded, not punished. If blacks
threatened to do too well, the rules were changed--- or whites resorted
to raw violence. What it took It was a different world in the 1960s.
Racism wasn\'t covert; it was right there in the open, and backed by
beatings, bombings, and death. White supremacy was assumed by the
lowliest Klan thug and enunciated flutingly by William F. Buckley ("The
central question\... is whether the White community in the South is
entitled to take such measures as are necessary to prevail, politically
and culturally, in areas in which it does not predominate numerically?
The sobering answer is Yes---the White community is so entitled because,
for the time being, it is the advanced race"). But [things have
changed]{.underline}, right? Right! They changed \' [because of hard
work by liberals: Legal challenges, such as]{.underline} Thurgood
Marshall s successful 1954 Supreme Court case, [Brown v. Board of
Education]{.underline}, which declared school segregation illegal.
Peaceful demonstrations, e.g. King\'s boycott of the segregated buses in
Montgomery. Black nationalism, as preached by Malcolm X and others---
important to get blacks to stand up for themselves, and also as a
reminder to whites that if King\'s nonviolence didn\'t work, there were
alternatives. (Not that Malcolm X himself actually used violent
methods--- but there were other activists who were open to that.)
[Federal support to ensure the rights of blacks to vote, move where they
liked, and have equal educational opportunities. Affirmative action to
prevent segregation and to increase opportunity for blacks. Economic aid
for the poor]{.underline} (which included vast numbers of whites).
[Journalistic coverage, which raised awareness of the issues and shone a
spotlight on the horrible abuses of the racists.]{.underline} This
excellent article by Hamden Rice points out that whites normally don\'t
understand what Dr. King did. His achievement wasn\'t to make white
people nicer. It was to end the state of terror for black people in the
South\... by teaching people to do all the provocative things they had
avoided doing (registering to vote, sitting at the \'white\' counter,
marching in the face of angry whites) for fear of being lynched. And
more--- you can find the full history elsewhere, and you should; it\'s a
fascinating story and offers essential lessons on how a social movement
happens. Some random books that have helped me understand it: King\'s
Stride Toward Freedom and Why We Can\'t Wait; Malcolm X\'s
Autobiography; John Griffin\'s Black Like Me; Dick Gregory\'s The Shadow
That Scares Me; Harper Lee\'s To Kill a Mockingbird; Alice Walker\'s The
Color Purple. One of the best contemporary guides is Ta-Nehisi Coates.
His article on reparations is essential reading, especially if you think
there\'s no problem any more. See also his reading list. An important
note: I used historical stories above in order to explain the historical
context for liberalism. I [don\'t mean to suggest that racism is
dead.]{.underline} In recent years we\'ve had plenty of reminders that
being a young black male in possession of a bag of Skittles or a toy gun
is considered by many to be a killing offense. The worried white man A
lot of people accept that the mistreatment of blacks was wrong, but any
actual attempt to mitigate it was bothersome. We can imagine a dialog:
Worried white man: If you work hard you\'ll get ahead. A: No we won\'t;
you closed off everything but menial work, and if we achieve anything,
it can be simply stolen by whites. WW: Did you try asking really nicely
for reform? A: Yes. We tried that for a hundred years. Nothing happened.
WW: You should have voted for politicians who would help you. A: Blacks
can\'t vote in the South, remember? WW: Uh\... we established the courts
to redress grievances\... did you try that? A: Yes, that was the first
successful tactic. But court judgments are ignored, if the authorities
don\'t like them. WW: Surely passing laws would be better than
demonstrations? A: We tried that constantly, but they were defeated by
the reactionaries in Congress. It wasn\'t till there was pressure from
the demonstrations that Johnson defied his own party to pass them. WW:
OK, but these demonstrations were so provocative. A: That\'s the word
exactly. We need to provoke change. WW: But demonstrations invite
lawlessness and violence. A: There is no violence in Dr. King\'s
movement, except what\'s done against us. WW: Couldn\'t you at least
suppress the Black Power people? They scare us. A: Tell you what, we
won\'t resort to revolution if you can show us that peaceful agitation
works. Like, say, make sure that Dr. King doesn\'t get shot. WW: Oops.

### 1AR - Liberalism Good -- Combats Oppression

#### Liberalism can recognize and combat systemic oppression

**Huseyinzadegan**, Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Emory, **15**

(Dilek, Kantian Review, Volume 20, Issue 1, p. 150-154, DG)

[Chapter 1 ('Liberalism and Oppression') provides a compelling defence
of liberalism.]{.underline} Additionally, [drawing on Marilyn Frye's
well-known work 'Oppression']{.underline}, [Hay formulates an original
list]{.underline} of the necessary and sufficient book reviews, [subject
to the conditions for recognizing oppression]{.underline} (pp. 4--5).
[This chapter argues that liberalism can both recognize and combat
systemic oppression. Hay's version of 'at least a partly comprehensive
liberalism' synthesizes Jean Hampton's comprehensive liberalism with
Martha Nussbaum's pluralism and capabilities approach]{.underline} (p.
39[). The chapter concludes with a defence of both transcultural moral
ideals and the importance of autonomy; these, Hay argues, are the
resources that a feminist interpretation of Kant can offer to a
comprehensive liberalism.]{.underline} Chapter 2 ('A Feminist Defence of
Kant') responds to two major objections raised against the applicability
of Kantian ethics to feminist concerns. These objections are the
embodiment objection, the criticism that the Kantian dichotomy between
the rational and the animal makes Kant unsuitable for feminist
theorizing (pp. 52--3), and the emotions objection, the criticism that
Kant's prioritization of the rational over the emotional makes Kant
unsuitable for feminist theorizing (pp. 56--7). Hay's response to the
emotions objection is perhaps the most lucid defence of why, in light of
his attempt to find an a priori universal basis for morality, Kant could
not have prioritized emotions. However, the current scholarly
rapprochement between Kant and feminism is much more nuanced than Hay
here suggests: the debate does not really revolve around two extreme
alternatives, namely, that Kant either is sexist and useless for
feminism or that we must ignore his sexism in order to make feminist use
of the resources found in his philosophy. This oversimplification of the
relationship between Kantianism and feminism, together with Hay's
exclusion of Kant's anthropology, leads me to my first reservation. Hay
offers two reasons why feminists can safely ignore the misogyny and
sexism that abound in Kant's Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View
and Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and the Sublime: (1)
these works are widely regarded as peripheral (pp. 50--2); (2) they
merely represent the social mores of Kant's time (p. 52). Both of these
claims, however, are more controversial than Hay acknowledges. In regard
to the first, recent scholarship, especially that of Robert Louden, has
demonstrated that these texts are integral to the Kantian system as
'applied ethics' and that they are therefore central to any application
of Kant's moral theory. In regard to the second, many scholars, most
notably Pauline Kleingeld, have, as Hay mentions, argued that reading
Kant's ethical works in a gender-neutral manner obfuscates their
meaning. Paradoxically enough, after having claimed that these works are
peripheral and should be ignored by feminists, Hay responds to the
embodiment and emotions objections in large part by appealing (pp. 58,
61) to several arguments found in Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of
View. My view is that an analysis of the Anthropology, especially Kant's
arguments for the second-class status of women as moral and political
agents, would offer a more nuanced picture of how Kant can be book
reviews, subject to the used by feminists. Just as we feminists may need
and use a version of Kant's account of self-respect for our purposes, as
Hay does, we may also need and use a version of Kant's account of the
natural inequality of the sexes (as well as races and nationalities) to
recognize, trace, criticize and resist oppression in all forms. Chapter
3 ('The Obligation to Resist Sexual Harassment') opens with a concrete
example that Hay uses in the remainder of the book in order to develop a
theory of a Kantian imperfect duty to resist sexist oppression. The
example comes from David Foster Wallace's story about a female friend
who was sexually harassed while they were riding the Zipper together at
the Illinois State Fair. The men operating the Zipper stop the ride when
the female friend (referred to as the 'Native Companion' or NC because
she is local; the colonial resonances of this phrase, however, seem to
have been lost on both Wallace and Hay) is at the top hanging upside
down, so that her dress falls over her head and the men can ogle her (p.
89). After the ride, NC seems to deny that she was sexually harassed and
does not think that she has any obligation to say or do something about
the incident. Appealing to this scenario, the question that Hay asks in
the remainder of the book is whether all that sexually harassed women
can do is ignore the situation or whether they have an obligation to
confront their harassers. Chapter 3 then considers some practical and
normative objections that would override such an obligation (objections
from dangerous consequences, internalized oppression, lack of
self-respect, etc.) and suggests that none of these considerations
undermines the obligation itself. With this, Hay prepares the grounds
for the main theoretical move that she makes in the next chapter, where
she will claim that one has an imperfect Kantian duty to resist sexual
harassment in one way or another; it would be best, Hay argues, if we
fulfilled this duty in an external and visible way, but our maxim does
not contradict itself if the duty is not, in each case, fulfilled in
this way. Hay concludes that 'If we err on the side of caution in every
case and never require women to confront their harassers, then
patriarchy will never be eradicated' (p. 104). Following Robin Dillon,
Hay here claims that 'Properly responding to the realities of oppression
requires a robust appreciation of the importance of selfrespect' and
that 'Kant's moral framework provides the most promising theoretical
foundation for this task' (p. 72). Hay admits that Kantianism is hardly
the only framework to do so, but insists that, if feminists do not look
at Kant, 'they are throwing the baby (the Kantian duty of self-respect)
out with the bathwater (Kantianism) ... because Kant's account of
self-respect is unparalleled in its rigor' (p. 73). This brings me to my
second reservation, which has to do with the strong claim that feminists
do not possess the tools to articulate a rigorous notion of self-respect
without appealing to Kantianism. I would grant, as Hay successfully
demonstrates throughout the book, that a Kantian moral book reviews,
subject to the framework provides a promising theoretical foundation for
articulating such a notion. However, Hay does not demonstrate that this
is the best way to provide a robust account of self-respect together
with its importance for feminist theory, nor does she demonstrate that
this is the best way to explain what is wrong with sexist oppression. An
example of a feminist notion of selfdefinition and self-respect as
rigorous as that offered by Kantianism may be found in Patricia Hill
Collins's Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the
Politics of Empowerment (New York: Routledge, 1990). This book provides
a robust account of both recognizing and combating the effects of sexist
(as well as racist and classist) oppression without appealing to (or
explicitly dismissing, for that matter) Kantianism. Moreover, because
Hay's liberal feminism highlights gender as the most important aspect of
one's social identity (as opposed to, say, intersectional feminist
analyses of oppression that take into account race, class, age, sex,
religion, ethnicity, nationality and ability as well as gender), her
account of the harms of oppression, as well as her Zipper example,
remain very limited. Once again, neither feminisms nor feminist
conceptualizations of self-respect are as monolithic as Hay's liberal
feminism portrays them to be. An engagement with other feminist
frameworks would complicate Hay's bold claim and enrich her account of
recognizing and resisting oppression. In chapter 4 ('The Obligation to
Resist Oppression') Hay fully develops the argument that oppressed
people have an imperfect duty to resist oppression. Her argument can be
summarized as follows. (1) Oppression harms our rational nature; for
example, sexist social norms make women doubt their selfworth, take away
their ability for rational deliberation and cause weakness of will (pp.
123--4). (2) People have an obligation to protect their rational nature.
(3) Therefore, people have an obligation to resist their own oppression.
Because Hay wants to leave room for different ways of resisting
oppression (by directly confronting the harassers, by resisting
internally, by filing a complaint with management, by raising awareness
about the unfriendly environment at the State Fair, etc.), she finds the
best prospect for such an account in Kant's notion of an imperfect duty,
which allows for latitude regarding which actions may fulfil it (pp.
136--7; cf. Tugendlehre, 6: 390). As Hay notes, many actions can satisfy
the requirements of an imperfect duty (including, on occasion,
refraining from action), as long as our maxim is not to refrain from
action all the time (p. 139). Hay also considers the possibility that
the NC is resisting internally, which would then fulfil her imperfect
duty (p. 143). In light of Hay's analysis, one might formulate this
imperfect duty as: 'Resist oppression externally whenever possible' or
'Do not do nothing to end patriarchy'. That Hay appeals solely to
Kantian moral philosophy (Grundlegung and Tugendlehre) to develop a duty
to resist oppression leads me to my third reservation. The sharp
distinction that Hay draws between the moral and the book reviews,
subject to the political threatens to overdetermine her theoretical
moves, with the result that these moves may in fact undercut many of the
goals that she hopes to attain. This is the case especially given that
sexual harassment, as Hay also acknowledges, is an instance of a more
systemic problem of sexist oppression, which concerns a network of
relations, social and legal structures, patterns and practices. In light
of this, then, Hay's thesis would benefit from an analysis of Kant's
Rechtslehre, as this would allow her to develop not only a moral but
also a political-juridical duty to resist oppression. [As it stands,
however, there are no references to the Rechtslehre or the relevant
secondary literature in Kantianism, Liberalism, and Feminism. Hay claims
early on in her defence of a comprehensive liberalism that 'condemning
oppressive injustices requires going one step further, actually
requiring state intervention in certain cases' (p. 35). Here Hay opens
the possibility of defining oppression in political terms -- as a
violation of Kant's Universal Principle of Right, as hindrance to one's
freedom of choice, since oppression is not the condition in which
everyone should seek their rights -- and thus of developing an
additional duty of Recht to resist it; however, this possibility is left
unexplored.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Liberalism Good -- Peace

**Democratic liberalism reduces violent conflicts -- interdependence,
alliances, and institutions**

**Hammoud '18** (Mohammad, Assistant Teaching Professor at Carnegie
Mellon University in Qatar, "Determinants Of International Peace: An
Empirical Analysis," March 13, 2018, School of Graduate Studies of the

// kt

Peace is a state that occurs when the needs for survival, welfare, and
identity are fulfilled simultaneously (Galtung, 1967). Problems of
[peace should be studied at three distinct levels, individual, state,
and system]{.underline} (Sørensen, 1986). [At the individual level,
factors such as wealth, health, freedom, and the overall welfare of
individuals are crucial for maintaining stability. As for the state
level, states are expected to enforce security by implementing policies
that promote economic and political stability in a democratic
environment]{.underline}. Finally, [the system is what shapes economic
and political international relationships.]{.underline} Systems are
normally subjected to continuous changes, and states are expected to
form economic and political policies accordingly (Buzan, 1983). Previous
literature has widely discussed the relationship between trade, economic
interdependence, and peace. In the past few decades, several studies
have investigated the importance of trade openness for establishing
international peaceful relationships (e.g., Mansfield, 1994; Oneal et
al., 1996; Domke, 1988; Kim, 1998; Reuveny & Kang, 1996; Oneal & Ray,
1997; Way, 1997; Oneal & Russett, 1998; Russett et al., 1998). According
to Polachek (1980), [significant trading relationships between countries
would lead to lower likelihoods of engaging in any sort of conflict due
to the fear of possible welfare losses.]{.underline} Polachek (1980)
indicates that doubling the amount of trade between countries will
reduce possible hostility by 20% on average, ceteris paribus. The main
logic behind this relationship is that [countries are less likely to
fight if the price of fighting is associated with an additional
opportunity cost to that of military force expenses]{.underline}
(Gartzke et al., 2001). In 8 this case, the opportunity cost is any sort
of benefit that used to exist or that is lost due to the dispute.
According to Kilchevsky et al. (2007), political conflicts affect
financial gains and economic relations in general. Therefore, [major
domestic actors seek political pressure to prevent such
conflicts]{.underline}. Another argument by Hirschman (1980) and Stein
(1993) emphasizes that [trade leads to enhanced communication and
contact between nations, consequently increasing political cooperation
among trading partners]{.underline}. Similarly, Deutsch et al. (1957)
claim that **[trade openness favors inter-cultural exchange, which
increases the sense of community among trading partners]{.underline}**.
Countries would usually restrict trade with possible rivals, especially
in cases when trade includes natural resources that are essential to
economic growth and/or that could be used to build or fuel militarized
equipment. In this context, states cannot only consider the absolute
gains from trade because other countries' benefits might be threatening
if there is a serious military significance (Grieco, 1998). Moreover,
Gartzke et al. (2001) show that **[capital interdependence has the
highest contribution to peace,]{.underline}** compared to other
variables, complementing similar results which were previously found by
Oneal (1999) in a study covering the time period 1950-1992. Kilchevsky
et al. (2007) indicate that [Middle Eastern countries enjoy more
peaceful relationships with countries with which they are economically
interdependent]{.underline}. **[This observation supports the 'classic
liberals' idea that increasing political participation and expanding
economic interdependence through trade promotes peace]{.underline}**.
Polachek (1980) states that [the deterrent effect of trade on conflict
is directly related to the dependence and the strategic extent of
trade.]{.underline} On the other hand, some studies still insist that in
a multilateral trading system the opportunity cost of a dispute faced by
countries seeking strategic commodities decreases (Martin et al., 2008).
Their argument is based on the fact that the change of the world's
trading system from bilateral to multilateral facilitated the flow of
goods and services across regions. **[States tie alliance obligations
with economic agreements]{.underline}** for two reasons: first, **[to
deter aggression; and]{.underline}** second, [to promote further
economic agreements]{.underline} (Powers, 2006). [Previous literature
presents a significant relationship between alliances and
trade]{.underline} (Gowa & Mansfield, 1993, 2004; Gowa, 1994; Mansfield
& Bronson, 1997). **[Alliances]{.underline}** might **[serve as an
insurance for trading dyads that the gains from trade will not be
threatening if used to strengthen military capabilities.]{.underline}**
Therefore, [allied governments will view their partners' gains from
trade as an increase in the overall alliance's power]{.underline} (Long
& Leeds, 2006). In the presence of political coordination, economic
exchange is expected to increase, especially when it serves to eliminate
trading problems[. Firms are motivated to invest in trade whenever the
fear of future conflict between the home country and its trading
partners is eliminated by alliance obligations that will promote peace
and commerce]{.underline}. [Alliances might also promote trade through
reducing trade barriers]{.underline}. This could happen when trade
benefits gained by the security-providing state are not attractive
enough. As a result, [countries seeking external security would reduce
trade restrictions as compensation, making the offer more
attractive.]{.underline} Similarly, a country with strong military
capabilities might be able to convince another state to open its markets
through security promises, particularly when economic interests are not
sufficiently attractive. In this context, Long & Leeds (2006) find that
18% of treaties require the presence of economic ties or economic
cooperation between nations. [The continuous development of the
globalized system over the recent decades has generated new concerns and
challenges]{.underline}, **[which contributed to promoting regional
cooperation]{.underline}** (Zwartjes et al., 2012). **[Global approaches
were adopted after the failure of]{.underline}** 12 **[individual
efforts to tackle a complex range of growing economic and political
issues.]{.underline}** Regional organizations, which often lead to the
creation of Regional Trading Blocs (RTBs), are formed by independent
states to govern a specific geographical region of which they are part
of, based on uniform policies agreed upon by coordination. In most
cases, regional organizations are created to reach economic goals that
are difficult to attain when each state operates independently.
[Promoting trade and enhancing regional security are usually the
principal goals for regional organizations]{.underline}. Yet, [in some
cases, regional organizations participate in actions beyond the regional
borders]{.underline}. For instance, the European Union (EU) is a
regional organization engaging in different global actions and, thus, it
is naturally qualified as a global power. Kingah & Langenhove (2012)
argue that the effective role of regional organizations is based on
three determinants. The willingness to act is the first determinant that
differs among regional organizations. This determinant varies according
to the presence of active leaders willing to act and allocate resources
to make a difference. Some regional organizations would limit their
interventions to their regional borders, while others would go beyond
that. The extent of intervention is based on the second determinant
which is the acceptance of their actions beyond their geographic
borders. The presence of institutional collaboration with the United
Nations (UN) allows the UN Security Council to accept engagements beyond
borders. However, the third determinant, which is capability, remains a
constraint for both within and beyond borders' interventions. Some
regional organizations lack sufficient financial resources and suffer
from weak institutions that sometimes keep intervention within borders
minimal. In addition to the three determinants, drivers that initiate
the formation of regional organizations might also have a vital role in
determining 13 the degree of intervention. For instance, the African
Union (AU), which was initially known as the Organization of African
Unity (OAU), has always been driven by political initiatives to combat
colonialism and apartheid. This reality prevented the AU from allocating
any of its limited resources into economic planning. On the other hand,
the EU is an economically driven union, which was initiated as the
European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in 1957, and which has kept
economic planning as its primary goal since then. According to Russet &
Oneal (2001), **[a peaceful regional order is established through the
rise of three liberal principles known as democracy, economic
interdependence, and institution]{.underline}**s. Their argument covers
the fundamental prerequisites of a peaceful region. [Democracy is the
first principle since democracies are less likely to fight each
other]{.underline} (Ray, 1998). Therefore, establishing [a region with
all members being democracies provides a suitable political environment
for deterring aggression]{.underline}. As mentioned earlier[, economic
interdependence is a key promoter for peaceful cooperation among
states]{.underline} (Krasner, 1983). Finally, well-functioning
[international institutions play a key role in promoting cooperation and
the sustainability of formalized rules among members]{.underline}
(Martin, 1999). These liberal principles, if combined with the
previously mentioned determinants (willingness to act, acceptance of
actions, and capability), allows us to understand why regions like the
EU are peaceful, while regions like South Asia (Indian sub-continent)
are still struggling to maintain their peace levels (Chamka, 2014).
Holsti (1995) defines the characteristics of weak, strong, and failed
states, and reaches the conclusion that regions comprising strong states
enjoy higher peace levels compared to those comprising weak and failed
states 14

### 2AC -- Liberalism Good (Economies)

**Liberalism drastically reduces poverty and sustains developing
economies**

**Iacono '15** (Corey Iacono, FEE 2016 Thorpe Fellow, undergrad at
University of Rhode Island, 7-2-2015, \"In Praise of Capitalist
Globalization,\" Foundation for Economic Education (FEE),
<https://fee.org/articles/in-praise-of-capitalist-globalization/>) //kt

Beginning in the early 1990s, global capitalism has lapsed into "its
most savage form," according to progressive populist (and new papal
advisor) Naomi Klein. Indeed, the expansion of capitalism and freer
international trade has coincided with an era of slow economic growth,
high unemployment, increased child labor, skyrocketing inequality, and
grinding poverty. Just kidding, that's not what happened at all. In
fact, **[as the world has become more capitalist and more globalized,
the quality of life for the average person, and especially for the
average poor person, has increased substantially.]{.underline}** New
research from the Peterson Institute for International Economics finds
that [global median income doubled between 2003 and 2013. Over the same
period, global income inequality declined. **Renowned economist Xavier
Sala-i-Martin finds that absolute poverty rates have fallen around 80%
and "measures of global welfare \[have\] increased by somewhere between
128% and 145%" since 1970**]{.underline}. [The source of this
progress]{.underline} isn't a massive wealth redistribution program[;
it's massive wealth creation --- that is, **economic
growth.**]{.underline} Economists David Dollar and Aart Kraay found
that, [in a global sample of over 100 countries, changes in the income
growth of the bottom 40% of the world's income earners are highly
correlated with economic growth rates. On the other hand, changes in
inequality have contributed relatively little to changes in social
welfare of the poor.]{.underline} Seminal research produced by Roman
Wacziarg and Karen Horn Welch suggests that **[freer trade is an
important determinant of economic prosperity, which is an important
determinant of poverty reduction.]{.underline}** Using [quantitative
analysis and a thorough review of country-specific case studies of free
trade reforms]{.underline}, Wacziarg and Welch [found]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} [after countries reformed their trade policies in
favor of freer trade, average investment and economic growth surged
quite dramatically.]{.underline} Indeed, "**[countries that liberalized
their trade regimes experienced average annual growth rates that were
about 1.5 percentage points higher than before
liberalization."]{.underline}** While protectionists argue that policies
restricting trade are necessary to reduce poverty by protecting domestic
industries, empirical evidence favoring this assertion is scarce. A 2004
review of the evidence on trade liberalization (reform towards freer
trade) by Alan Winters found that: **[In the long run and on average,
trade liberalization is likely to be strongly poverty alleviating, and
there is no convincing evidence that it will generally increase overall
poverty or vulnerability.]{.underline}** In 2014, a decade later,
Winters published another review to see if new evidence had changed that
conclusion. The finding? "[The conclusion that liberalization generally
boosts income and thus reduces poverty has not changed."]{.underline}
Consider a study on trade liberalization in Indonesia, which found that
liberalization in the form of reductions of import tariffs led to an
increase in disposable income among poor households, which allowed them
to pull their children out of the labor force, ultimately leading to "a
strong decline" in the incidence of child labor. But [free trade is only
one aspect of economic freedom]{.underline}. Research using measures of
how free an economy is in general has similarly shown that **[countries
with more economic freedom enjoy lower poverty rates and that increases
in economic freedom are associated with decreases in poverty rates (and
vice versa]{.underline}**). [Foreign investment is also more desirable
than opponents of markets and globalization give it credit
for]{.underline}. The conventional wisdom in wealthy countries is that
multinational corporations exploit poor workers in developing countries
for cheap labor, profiting off people working in sweatshop conditions.
However, a review of the evidence published by the National Bureau of
Economic Research disputes this idea. According to authors Brown,
Deardorff, and Stern: [There is virtually no careful and systematic
evidence demonstrating that, as a generality, multinational firms
adversely affect their workers, provide incentives to worsen working
conditions, pay lower wages than in alternative employment, or repress
worker rights.]{.underline} In fact, [there is a very large body of
empirical evidence indicating that the opposite is the
case.]{.underline} **[Foreign ownership raises wages both by raising
labor productivity and by expanding the scale of production and, in the
process, improves the conditions of work.]{.underline}** Opponents of
globalization, like Klein, often try to shame consumers for purchasing
apparel that was made in third world countries. Buying these clothes
will just further perpetuate the exploitation of the poor in these
countries, we are told. However[, in poor countries like Bangladesh,
China, and Vietnam, the apparel industry consistently pays more than
most other industries]{.underline}. According to research by economist
Ben Powell, in poor countries "[most sweatshop jobs provide an above
average standard of living for their workers."]{.underline} In light of
this, it would hardly seem wise (or compassionate) to protest these jobs
or boycott their products. It's also worth noting that **[foreign
competition is another way that people in developing countries can be
made better off, by, for instance, inducing lower prices in important
consumer goods and expanding consumer's choices.]{.underline}** A recent
paper by a team of economists from several universities found that in
Mexico "foreign retail entry \[into domestic markets\] cause large and
significant welfare gains for the average household."
**[Anti-capitalists must also ask themselves: If these nightmarish
depictions of free markets and globalization were true, why is
capitalism so popular?]{.underline}** A recent Pew Research poll of 44
countries revealed that a global median of 66% of respondents say most
people are better off under capitalism, even if some people are rich and
some are poor. [Studies also show that there is an empirical regularity
that democracies are more likely to engage in free market reforms than
non-democracies]{.underline}. In recent work, Harvard and MIT economists
found that one of the ways democracy indirectly stimulates economic
growth is by increasing the likelihood of pro-market economic reforms.
Moreover, another [Pew Research poll found that]{.underline} [in 41 of
the 46 countries surveyed, majorities or pluralities said they believed
foreign companies are having a positive effect on their country. In
fact, people in poorer nations are more likely to say that foreign
investment is good than people in richer nations. While wealthy
progressives depict free markets, trade, and foreign investment as
inherently exploitative, the world's poorest people see them as
opportunities for a better future.]{.underline} In this era of "savage
capitalism," **[the world has seen unprecedented declines in poverty and
increases in global welfare,]{.underline}** especially in the countries
that have embraced free markets and free trade.

### 2AC - Liberal Interventionism Good

#### Interventions in Kosovo [were a testament]{.underline} to how [responsible]{.underline} US action can [deter human rights violators]{.underline} and [effectuate material change]{.underline}

6-9-1999)//EF

[There's no such thing as a good war. But some wars do deliver
justice]{.underline}, and, 20 years ago, the United States won such a
war. [On June 9, 1999, after 11 weeks of aerial bombing by NATO,
dictator Slobodan Milosevic was forced to capitulate and end his
ethnic-cleansing campaign in Kosovo]{.underline}. I was a 15-year-old
refugee at the time --- one among more than 1 million Kosovar Albanians
who, much like many Syrians today, were forced to flee their homes.
Unlike the Syrians, we were lucky. Someone stood up for us before it was
too late. Those who wanted to kill or deport us were thwarted, and we
were able to return to rebuild our homes. I remember coming back to my
home city of Prishtina to jubilant streets. It was July 4, and in the
center of the city, the Albanian American unit of the Kosovo Liberation
Army was celebrating U.S. Independence Day. That scene marked for me the
beginning of our honest --- and often obsessive --- love affair with the
United States. [Like much of the Balkans, Kosovo is still struggling on
many fronts. But we were right to celebrate back then.]{.underline}
Democracy-building and development are never easy, especially in
post-conflict settings. [What's important is that the region has since
remained stable and continues to look forward]{.underline}. **[Thus, by
any measurable parameter, the U.S.-led intervention in Kosovo was a
success]{.underline}**. And it's one that the United States needs to
remember as it struggles with doubts about its engagement in the
so-called post-American world. [As someone who has seen firsthand the
importance of U.S. engagement, I am troubled by the increased resonance
of isolationist thinking in U.S. politics and media.]{.underline} Those
voices have, of course, always been there. Twenty years ago, some on the
fringes even rationalized Milosevic as he was butchering civilians and
blamed NATO for the mess. But for every Noam Chomsky who saw U.S.
imperial overreach at play, there was a Susan Sontag or Christopher
Hitchens who focused on human suffering and articulated the
responsibility to protect victims. It's a testament to how much the
world has changed that this sense of responsibility to use U.S. power
seems to have greatly diminished in the U.S. public sphere. [The
skepticism is understandable. The United States' global involvement has
come at a high social and economic cost at home]{.underline}. People
also associate engagement with the more recent failures in the Middle
East --- especially, of course, the war in Iraq. Then there's the
appreciation of the limits to what the United States can do in a
multipolar world. And, of course, the rightful anger with European
allies for not sharing the burden fairly. But [while these are
legitimate concerns, there are other lines of isolationist reasoning
creeping into the mainstream that are not just deeply erroneous but also
very dangerous]{.underline}. [The first is the moral equivalence
worldview, which equates U.S. engagement in world affairs with the
engagement of authoritarian regimes. The second is the skeptical realist
worldview, which advocates U.S. engagement only when it aligns with
narrowly defined national interests]{.underline}. **[The combination of
these extremes of self-doubt and self-interest in mainstream U.S.
discourse puts the entire democratic world at risk.]{.underline}** It
distorts people's perception not just of the merits of defending
democracy and human rights abroad, but also of how they need to be
defended. While it's encouraging to see that [younger
people]{.underline} in the United States [are more likely to consider
genocide prevention and human rights protection top foreign policy
priorities]{.underline} than older generations, t[hey are paradoxically
also less likely to consider it important to limit]{.underline} the
[influence of authoritarian countries such as China and Russia ---
**which actively empower tyrants and promote alternatives to democracy
around the world**]{.underline}**.** These two positions are mutually
exclusive[. One cannot protect the sheep from the wolves if the wolves
are not actively contained]{.underline} --- not by going to war with
other powers but by countering their influence in fragile democracies,
much like how the United States shielded Europe from the Soviet Union.
[Twenty years ago, NATO decided to intervene in Kosovo because it
learned a lesson from the international community's earlier inaction in
preventing the genocides in Bosnia and Rwanda.]{.underline} **[The
lesson was that human rights violators are emboldened by the lack of
credible deterrents]{.underline}**. We now live in a world of emboldened
autocrats. The democratic world needs the United States to look back at
successes such as Kosovo and restore its confidence on the world stage,
so it can defend the democratic space that is also central to U.S.
security. In almost all cases, engagement does not mean the use of
force. Stepping up support for grass-roots democratic forces through the
vast range of diplomatic and economic tools will suffice to achieve this
goal. [But this will work only if the United States operates in a system
of broad alliances that share burdens and, yes, create credible military
deterrents]{.underline}. That's why the main priority should be to
double down on NATO and restore the transatlantic alliance. Even in the
realist age of great power competition, there are no better allies than
those that share your values. And values in foreign policy matter. Trust
this former refugee.

### 1AR -- Liberal Interventionism Good

#### The effectiveness of [negotiations, diplomacy]{.underline}, and [Alabnian-backed intervention]{.underline} during the Kosovo War [proves]{.underline} 

**Engel** (D-N.Y.); **Zherka,** Opinion Contributor @ The Hill**,

intervention in Kosovo,"
<https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/435462-lessons-from-the-1999-us-military-intervention-in-kosovo)//EF>

Twenty years ago on March 24, the United States launched Operation
Allied Force against strategic positions in Serbia. [The bombing
campaign ultimately ended the ethnic cleansing unleashed by Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic in Kosovo.]{.underline} This type of effort
is certainly rare in our history. **[Its success, however, offers
lessons for us today as we continue to face humanitarian crises caused
by war]{.underline}**. [Milosevic]{.underline} in 1998 launched his
fourth war in the former Yugoslavia, this time [intending to address his
"Albanian problem" by using his army to force out over 60 percent of the
population of Kosovo]{.underline}. Given European and American inaction
for years as people were killed in Bosnia earlier in the decade,
[Albanian Americans were fearful]{.underline} that history could be
repeated in Kosovo. S[o, they organized themselves. They united
different community factions]{.underline}, opened an office in
Washington, D.C., [and began engaging in one of the oldest of American
traditions -- petitioning their government to do something to stop the
killing]{.underline} and rape in Kosovo. [The community's activism was
critical.]{.underline} Albanian Americans, in meetings, television
appearances, and rallies, provided real moral clarity for members of
Congress, the Clinton administration, and the public. The community had
also spent over a decade earning the trust and respect of their elected
officials. [That community engagement made it more possible for us to
find bipartisan support in Congress for military intervention during a
difficult time in the United States.]{.underline} The country had just
experienced the impeachment and attempted removal of President Bill
Clinton. Tensions between the political parties were high. Yet, Sens.
Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Joe Biden (D-Del.) worked together with
their Senate colleagues to support intervention and a bipartisan group
in the House that included New York Republican Susan Molinari and one of
the authors (Engel). Those members were certainly moved to action by
their constituents and the reports of atrocities on the ground. Just as
importantly, however, [we all understood that the ethnic cleansing
campaign and the massive refugee crisis it created would have dire
consequences for the Balkans, and, ultimately, Europe]{.underline}. Over
1.2 million Kosovar refugees flooded Albania and Macedonia, neighboring
poor countries that were too ill equipped to handle them. [Those
countries would have been devastated if we allowed the cleansing
campaign to stand.]{.underline} The crisis also would have led to more
violence in the region and refugees fleeing to Western Europe. With
bipartisan support in Congress for intervention and clarity that it was
in our national interest to do so, the Clinton administration did the
important work of engaging our NATO allies. [They also actively mediated
peace negotiations between Serbia and Kosovo. We attended the talks in
Rambouillet, France where we witnessed the good faith efforts of the
Kosovars to reach an accord and the intransigence of the Former Yugoslav
negotiators.]{.underline} Milosevic was hoping to wait out the
Americans. [Military intervention became the only option for ending the
horrific violence in Kosovo when the peace process failed. Importantly,
the U.S. got our NATO allies to join the effort]{.underline}. From the
start, Operation Allied Force would be a limited campaign. Americans
were not quite ready to send troops on the ground. The bombing campaign
lasted 78 days. When it was all over, Belgrade had withdrawn its forces
and Kosovars returned home. Eventually, Milosevic would be arrested and
brought to The Hague to face charges for war crimes. Kosovo would
become, with U.S. leadership, a newly independent, democratic country.
[While Kosovo and the region still face challenges, the lessons from the
Kosovo War are clear. Non-political community engagement can make
bipartisanship possible, which in turn can enable American leadership in
the world.]{.underline} That leadership is essential when our national
interests are at stake. Today, the Balkans are at peace, democracy
(although imperfect) reigns, and many of the countries there are now
members of NATO. All of that is true because enough people in Washington
in 1999 had the courage to cross party lines in support of our national
security.

[The reaction of the United States to 9/11]{.underline} -- including the
declaration of a "war on terror" and the invasion of Afghanistan and
Iraq -- [added fuel to]{.underline} these [peacebuilding-as-imperialism
arguments]{.underline}. After all, the Bush Administration justified its
invasions partly on liberal grounds: as a means of providing the
benefits of democracy and freedom to oppressed societies. [Efforts to
stabilize Iraq after the invasion also bore at least a partial
resemblance to liberal peacebuilding strategies pursued elsewhere by the
United Nations and by other international agencies in countries emerging
from civil wars]{.underline}. [Elections, constitutional processes,
market-oriented economic adjustment and institution-building were
central to the US plan in Iraq and also part of the standard formula for
UN-mandated peace operation]{.underline}s. [Given these apparent
similarities]{.underline} and the disastrous effects of the Iraq
invasion, **[it was not long before]{.underline}** **[commentators began
equating the Iraq war and international peacebuilding missions as a part
of an abhorrent phenomenon of "democratic imperialism]{.underline}**"30
or "imperial nation-building."31 In the words of Wolfram Lacher, for
example, "Statebuilding and reconstruction practices in Iraq are in
continuity with international operations during the post-Cold War era
and beyond" because they have all involved "the reproduction and
expansion of hegemonic international order."32 Alejandro Bendaña also
portrayed the Iraq war as a natural extension of 1990s-era peacebuilding
operations, which had promoted the "external economic and strategic
interests" at the expense of such principles as justice and
self-determination, thereby "opening the door to Washington's subsequent
savagery" in Iraq.33 Similarly, John Gray insisted that liberal
peacebuilding and the Iraq invasion are based on the same flawed methods
and assumptions: the "liberal interventionism that took root in the
aftermath of the Cold War was never much more than a combination of
post-imperial nostalgia with crackpot geopolitics," as events in Iraq
definitively demonstrated, in his view.34 [Frustration at America's
"regime change" invasion of Iraq]{.underline} thus seemed to [contribute
to a mounting backlash against all forms of liberal interventionism
including UN-sponsored peacebuilding**. It also deepened skepticism
about the legitimacy and feasibility of promoting democracy and
market-oriented economics as a remedy for civil conflict.**]{.underline}
Instead of simply critiquing the manner by which international agencies
support liberal democratic transitions in war-torn states, some
commentators began to dismiss the entire enterprise as "futile,"35
"folly,"36 "delusional,"37 "hubristic,"38 and destined to produce
"enemies instead of allies and \[to heighten\] insecurity instead of
enhancing security."39 Similarly, rather than simply examining the
similarities between old-style colonialism and modern peacebuilding,
some commentators went much further and claimed that liberal
interventionism was colonialism or imperialism, now "comprehensively
discredited in the killing fields of Fallujah and Samarra."40 Thus,
measured skepticism about the difficulties or appropriateness of
promoting liberalization in specific postwar circumstances gave way, in
some quarters, to an almost indiscriminate indictment of such efforts,
which contributed to what Neil Cooper has called a "crisis of confidence
and credibility...in the Western liberal peace project."41 In summary,
[the pendulum of peacebuilding analysis has swung from one extreme to
another.]{.underline} After a period of irrational exuberance about the
almost magical effects of liberalization, the study of this field
entered a phase of constructive skepticism about the effectiveness or
propriety of liberal peacebuilding strategies, but the pendulum kept on
swinging, driven in part by 9/11 and the Iraq war. Today, expressions of
distrust, pessimism and even cynicism about liberal peacebuilding have
become more common. [There are interesting parallels between the heady
optimism of the early 1990s and the current "crisis of confidence" in
the strategy of promoting peace through liberalization. Both of these
positions can be viewed as reactions to major opinion-shaping events in
international affairs. In the former instance, it was the end of the
Cold war and the apparent "victory" of liberalism that informed the
early optimism about liberal peacebuilding]{.underline}. In the latter
period, [it was the Bush Administration's actions]{.underline} (and its
appropriation of the language of liberalization to rationalize and
justify its own destructive unilateralism) [that contributed to a turn
towards pessimism]{.underline}. [Both positions,]{.underline} moreover,
**[reflected the zeitgeist of their respective times. In]{.underline}**
the early 1990s there was a widely shared view that liberal democracy
had emerged "the only model of government with any broad legitimacy and
ideological appeal in the world" (as evidenced by the more than three
dozen countries that adopted liberal democratic constitutions for the
first time between 1990 and 1996),42 whereas the 2000s witnessed
democratic reversals in Africa, South America and elsewhere, leading
many to lament the "sobering state" of democracy in the world.43
However, both of these extremely positive and extremely negative views
of liberal peacebuilding have been based on exaggerated claims about the
benefits (in the early 1990s) or the liabilities (in the late 2000s) of
these missions. [While the mixed record of more than 20 operations to
date has shown that democratization and marketization are not
all-purpose elixirs for societies emerging from civil conflict, **the
recent backlash against liberal peacebuilding is just as immoderate and
mistaken as the earlier optimism.** It is also reckless, as I shall
argue below.]{.underline}

Mistake #1: Conflating Post-Conquest and Post-Settlement Peacebuilding
As noted above, [several commentators have characterized the US invasion
and]{.underline} subsequent [occupation of Iraq as equivalent
to]{.underline}, or a natural extension of, the [multilateral
peacebuilding missions of the post-Cold War era.]{.underline} [According
to this perspective, supporters]{.underline} of liberal peacebuilding as
well as US neo-[conservatives who pushed for "regime change" in Iraq
have all suffered from the same]{.underline} **[delusions and hegemonic
impulses]{.underline}**, which have led to dangerous and futile efforts
to impose democracy by force. [Less extreme versions]{.underline} of
this argument [make distinctions]{.underline} between UN-sponsored and
unilateral types of intervention, [but nevertheless suggest]{.underline}
that the practice of [postwar peacebuilding "open\[ed\] the door" to
American liberal imperialism]{.underline} in Iraq and Afghanistan.44
Given the dreadful effects of the Iraq war, such assertions have the
effect of raising serious doubts about the entire peacebuilding
enterprise. [Although the post-conflict stabilization mission in Iraq
and other peacebuilding missions share some characteristics in common,
including a sometimes naïve belief in the salubrious effects of holding
quick democratic elections, **their differences should not be
ignored**.]{.underline} Most importantly, [the US operation in Iraq
began with an external invasion]{.underline} -- a war of conquest --
[followed by peacebuilding and counter-insurgency efforts, whereas most
peacebuilding missions since the end of the Cold War have been
**deployed at the request of local parties after the negotiation of
peace settlements to civil wars.**]{.underline}45 These "conditions of
birth" are important. [When peacebuilding follows conquest]{.underline},
foreign [peacebuilders are more likely to be viewed as occupiers,
particularly when they are the same parties that invaded the country in
the first place;]{.underline} and any new governing arrangements
established during this period are more likely to be viewed as external
impositions.46 [Although all]{.underline} peacebuilding [missions
involve a measure of foreign intrusion]{.underline} in domestic affairs,
[destroying a regime]{.underline} through external invasion [is hardly
equivalent,]{.underline} in degree or kind, [to d]{.underline}eploying
[a mission at the request of local parties]{.underline} with the goal of
helping these parties to implement a peace settlement.47 To be sure,
there are examples of post-Cold War peace operations that began in
less-than-consensual conditions -- most notably, the mission in Kosovo,
which followed NATO's bombing of Serb targets in that territory -- but
the vast majority of missions have not involved forcible entry: they
have been examples of postsettlement, not post-conquest, peacebuilding.
[Blurring this distinction invites false analogizing between UN
peacebuilding and the American-led "war on terror."]{.underline}
[Although there are similarities between European colonialism and
today's]{.underline} post-settlement peacebuilding [operations, such
comparisons should also not be taken too far]{.underline}. To be sure,
both types of intervention have involved powerful external actors
seeking to refashion the domestic structures of weaker societies in
accordance with prevailing notions of good or "civilized" governance. In
this sense, today's post-conflict missions may be viewed as a modern
version of the old mission civilisatrice -- or the belief that European
colonial powers had a duty to improve the people living in their
overseas possessions -- now translated into contemporary parlance of
"capacity building" and "good governance." Furthermore, as many have
pointed out, international administrators have exercised extraordinarily
broad powers in several modern missions, including the right to dismiss
local officials from office who allegedly violate the terms or spirit of
a peace agreement. To some commentators, these powers resemble the
far-reaching authority of colonial administrators and create similar
relations of dependency and domination. [However, the old and new
version]{.underline}s of civilizing mission also [differ in important
respects]{.underline} -- differences that are often elided by those who
portray peacebuilding as a form of imperialism.48 [First, colonialism
was practiced largely to benefit the imperial states themselves,
including]{.underline} through the [extraction of material and human
resources]{.underline} from the colonized society.49 In spite of the
self-proclaimed civilizing mission including the purported benefits of
colonialism for the colonized, the most enduring and "unquestioned"
assumption of French colonial policy, for instance, was that colonies
must benefit France itself -- both materially and strategically.50 The
same was true of Britain, where 19th century debates over the costs and
benefits of colonialism focused not on whether to get rid of the
colonies, but rather, on "how to organize them so as to make the best
use of them with a minimum of effort and expense."51 [While modern
UNsponsored missions still reflect the interests of the world's most
powerful countries -- and therefore cannot be viewed as "innocent
assistance"52 -- **they have not principally been motivated by efforts
to extract wealth from their host societies**.]{.underline}53 On the
contrary, [the predominant flow of resources]{.underline} in
contemporary peacebuilding [has been in the opposite **direction: from
international actors to the host state.**]{.underline} Moreover, those
who claim that post-settlement peacebuilding serves the interests of
"transnational capitalism" have yet to demonstrate that either the
expectation or the desire for economic gain has driven the decision to
launch any such operations. Second, although the various European
colonial powers differed on the prospects and desirability of their
respective colonies moving towards independence, it was not until the
20th century that the ethic of "national self-determination" fully
discredited the traditional view of colonies as imperial possessions.
Put differently, shifts in the normative environment of international
affairs gradually made colonialism impossible to justify or continue. As
Neta Crawford points out, "Colonialism -- the political control,
physical occupation, and domination by one group of people over another
and their land for purposes of extraction and settlement to benefit the
occupiers -- was considered a 'normal' practice until the early 20th
century."54 [The anti-colonialist ethic continues to predominate today
and shapes the normative environment in which modern peacebuilding
operations have unfolded]{.underline}.55 [Even the longest-lasting
and]{.underline} most [intrusive missions of recent years have been
designed to exercise temporary and transitional authority in their host
states, and to create the conditions for effective self-government in
those states]{.underline}. To be clear, **[I am not suggesting that
colonialism was wholly self-interested or that modern peacebuilding is
wholly altruistic.]{.underline}** Both practices involved complex
mixtures of motivations and effects.56 For this reason, it is
interesting to compare and contrast these practices. But observing that
there are echoes of colonialism in peacebuilding is quite different from
asserting their equivalence. [Not only is the colonialism-peacebuilding
analogy overstated, but it also serves to discredit and delegitimize
peacebuilding by establishing an "interpretive frame" in which these
missions are portrayed as exploitative, destructive, and ultimately
disreputable forms of international intervention and
assistance]{.underline}.57 Further, such characterizations make it
difficult to distinguish between different types of peacebuilding, some
of which have stronger echoes of imperialism than others.

### 2AC - Critics Wrong - Generic

#### **Critics of liberalism oversimplify and ignore its history -- rejections empirically result in bloodshed and violence**

University, 17** -- (Lisandro E., \"Defending Liberalism in the Global

/ncp-AW

Ordered Liberty in the Global South [So far]{.underline}, the
[work]{.underline} that has theorized liberalism in relation to
postcolonial societies has been condemnatory, [viewing liberalism as the
handmaiden of colonialism]{.underline}. Most of these criticisms may be
traced to thinkers that predate postcolonial theory. According to
François Furet, leftwing thinkers in the nineteenth century began to
argue \"that modern liberal democracy was threatening society with
dissolution because it atomized individuals, made them indifferent to
public interest, weakened authority, and encouraged class hatred\"
(2000, 11). This [disdain for liberalism]{.underline}, Furet adds,
[culminated in two anti-liberal ideologies that produced **tremendous
bloodshed**: Nazism/fascism on the right and Leninist Communism on the
left]{.underline} (24). Though both ideologies clashed in the Second
World War, they nonetheless mirrored each other in their disdain for
effete liberals. For thinkers who seek radical, categorical breaks with
the present, [liberalism has always been an easy target]{.underline}.
This nineteenth century anti-liberal disdain has been reproduced in
critiques from postcolonial theory and theory from the Global
South---terms that I interpret interchangeably in light of Grovugui\'s
contention that the Global South is \"a symbolic designation meant to
capture the semblance of cohesion that emerged when former colonial
entities engaged in political projects of decolonization and moved
toward the realization of a postcolonial international order\" (2011,
176). The cavalier way in which postcolonial critics treat liberalism
can be gleaned from their refusal to even define the term. As we shall
see, [these theorists often use \"liberalism\" interchangeably with
\"neoliberalism\" or even \"capitalism.\"]{.underline} Those who do
define this political philosophy do so in a way [that erases the
plenitude of its history]{.underline}---the various vectors that have
informed its complex and uneven spread. For many of these thinkers,
liberalism represents what the Global South is not; it is a common enemy
that unites the diverse experiences of formerly colonized peoples.1 One
might even contend that, without liberalism as a common antithesis,
there can be no Global South. Yet I hope to show that [the South must be
considered]{.underline} not only [a space]{.underline} of opposition to
liberalism but one **[where liberalism may be rethought
anew.]{.underline}** To rethink liberalism, we must return to its basic
elements. For Alan Ryan, [all liberalism has been \"a perennial protest
against all forms of absolute authority\" and thereby seeks to avoid
\"absolute and arbitrary power\" by promoting]{.underline} \[End Page
94\] [\"toleration and an antipathy to closing ranks around any system
of beliefs\"]{.underline} (2012, 28, 29, 22). For Walter Russell Mead,
all liberals have sought to create \"ordered liberty,\" where
institutions both circumscribe power and enable individual freedom.
\"Even though humanity is imperfect and flawed,\" he argues, \"that
doesn\'t mean we cannot have constitutional, political, and social
arrangements that, given the limits on man\'s nature, can at least
provide a society where the individual is as unconstrained as possible\"
(2013, np). [There is a duality here.]{.underline} On the one hand, the
need for mediation of different beliefs requires [a constant negotiation
of ethical claims]{.underline}. On the other, the focus on individual
liberty forces the liberal to insist on [the universal inviolability of
that individual]{.underline}. John Gray, therefore, contends that:
**[Liberalism has always had two faces]{.underline}**. From one side,
toleration is the pursuit of an ideal form of life. From the other, it
is the search for terms of peace among different ways of life. In the
former view, liberal institutions are seen as applications of universal
principles. In the latter, they are means to peaceful coexistence.
(2000, 2) Because liberalism mediates, **[it allows for plural
values]{.underline}**. But because it insists on universal principles
like human rights, **[it refuses to slip into moral
relativism]{.underline}**. [Unfortunately, much]{.underline}
postcolonial [theorizing]{.underline} on liberalism [has failed to
acknowledge the complexity of a philosophy that swings like a pendulum
between order and freedom]{.underline}, deliberative truths and
universal principles.

### 1AR -- Critics Wrong - Generic

#### Liberalism empirically [works]{.underline} counter to critics' claims -- falling birth and death rates, rising income and inclusivity

sociology and public affairs at Princeton University, 07** -- (Paul,

Liberals differ from conservatives today not just about government's
proper role but more fundamentally about how to produce power and wealth
and advance equal rights to freedom in the process. Liberals have
insisted that government can take on broader functions without
sacrificing individual freedom as long as the law provides strong
safeguards against arbitrary power. [Modern liberalism]{.underline},
therefore, [calls]{.underline} not just for broader social protections
but also [for stronger guarantees of civil liberties and less government
regulation of private moral life]{.underline}. In contrast, modern
conservatism has become a combi-nation, in varying degrees, of devotion
to the free market and social traditionalism. Each side of conservatism
has provided a justification of inequalities that liberalism has
attempted to reduce or eliminate. The two political philosophies offer
contrasting ways of resolv-ing conflicts among liberties. Conservatives
have generally given higher priority to property rights and,
accordingly, to the rights of those with property, whereas liberals have
given higher prior-ity and broader scope to other constitutional
liberties and civil rights, often those of the historically
disadvantaged. Conservatives and liberals have also responded
differently to a phenomenon that did not exist in the 18th century when
constitutional liberalism took shape: the modern corpora-tion. While
conservatives have treated private corporations as analogous to
individuals and deserving of the same liberties, [liberals have regarded
corporations as a phenomenon of power, needing control like government
itself]{.underline}. The discipline of power that constitutional
liberalism imposes upon the state modern liberalism attempts to impose
on the cor-poration, albeit not in the same way. [As liberal reforms
gained ground]{.underline} dur-ing the past two centuries, conservatives
predicted that they would be morally destructive, economically ruinous,
and politically suicidal, while [socialist critics main-tained that the
socioeconomic changes advocated by liberals were merely cosmetic and
would make no difference at all]{.underline}. **[Modern liberalism's
historical record turned out to be better than either of these camps
anticipated.]{.underline}** With increased social expenditures, labor
and environmental regulation, and other reforms, the liberal
**[capitalist democracies became more produc-tive, mortality as well as
birth rates fell, per capita income rose, and the circle of prosperity
expanded.]{.underline}** Rather than destroying private wealth, the
modern liberal state made it more secure. In describing these changes, I
do not mean to suggest that liberals from the start had a clearly
developed theory guiding reforms, much less all the right answers.
Rather than formu-lating policy from speculative axioms, reformers
beginning in the mid-19th century increasingly devoted themselves to the
gathering and analysis of socioeconomic data. In America, the measures
adopted during [the Progressive era, New Deal, and Great
Society]{.underline} were often ad hoc and experimental, and many
failed. But partly through better knowledge, partly by trial and error,
liberal governments discovered that certain forms of lim-ited state
intervention could help bring the promise of a free and just society
closer to fulfillment while reducing the waste of human and physical
resources and improving economic performance. Modern liberalism has
never been ruled by a theory in the way that free-market conservatism
and Marxian socialism have been. **[A pragmatic emphasis on experience
and evidence---on how things work in practice---has been critical in
making liberalism work.]{.underline}**

#### Their critiques of liberalism ignore the real progress that's been made -- liberalism is a constantly evolving process, not an end point

**Pethokoukis, DeWitt Wallace Fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, 19** -- (James, AEIdeas, "There still isn't a good
alternative to liberalism or, if you prefer, democratic capitalism,"

George Will asks in this new book, "The Conservative Sensibility," the
following question: What is it, exactly, that conservatives seek to
conserve? His "concise but deceptively simple answer" is that American
conservatives seek to conserve the American Founding and the liberalism
that infused it. Liberalism is also the subject of a new Martin Wolf
column in the Financial Times, which begins with this definition of the
term: L[iberalism is not a precise philosophy, it is an
attitude.]{.underline} [All liberals share a belief in individual human
agency. They trust in the capacity of human beings to decide things for
themselves.]{.underline} This belief has radical implications. It
implies the right to make their own plans, to express their own opinions
and to participate in public life. These attitudes were [realized in the
system we call "liberal democracy".]{.underline} Liberals share a belief
that agency depends on possession of economic and political rights.
Institutions are needed to protect those rights --- independent legal
systems, above all. But agency also depends on markets to co-ordinate
independent economic actors, free media to allow the spread of opinions,
and political parties to organize politics. Behind these institutions
are values and behaviors: the distinction between private gain and
public purpose needed to curb corruption; a sense of citizenship; and
belief in toleration. Another term is "democratic capitalism," which I
like since it acknowledges the interdependence and shared success of
economic and political freedom. They sure seem to work well together, as
this chart from Wolf's column suggests: \[graph omitted\] Wolf adds
that, "**[Liberalism is not a utopian project, it is a work in perpetual
progress]{.underline}**." Indeed, utopianism is the enemy of liberalism.
As Chelsea Follett of the Cato Institute's Human Progress project wrote
last year: "[A realistic picture of the human condition should compare
the imperfect present with a much more imperfect past rather than with
an imagined utopia in the future, as well as acknowledge the truly
incredible progress that humanity has already made. Unfortunately,
instead of viewing the present as a vast improvement on the past, many
people see the present as failing to live up to some sort of ideal world
and deny the progress that has been achieved.]{.underline}" **[Maybe
there is an alternative, but the ones that actually exist aren't
great]{.underline}**: \[graph omitted\]

### 2AC -- Critics Wrong -- AT: Cap

#### **Liberalism's key to check the free market's excesses -- it's historically shown the ability to self-correct and criticism [oversimplifies]{.underline}, is based on straw man arguments, and is unfalsifiable**

University, 17** -- (Lisandro E., \"Defending Liberalism in the Global

The final anti-liberal claim I wish to address is [a materialist one,
which says that liberalism is but the handmaiden of capitalism and
modern neoliberalism]{.underline}. While this argument is common within
cultural theory in general, it is once again the Comaroffs who best
articulate the point in the context of works on the Global South.5 In
Millennial Capitalism, they contend that \"if law underpins the langue
of neoliberalism, constitutionalism has become the parole of universal
human rights, a global argot that individuates the citizen and, by
making cultural identity a private asset, rather than a collective
claim, transmutes difference into likeness\" (2001, 39--40). Both
contemporary capitalism and liberal discourse, such as human rights,
therefore, erase difference, making collective action impossible. \[End
Page 98\] Again, I offer two responses. [First, while it is true that
much liberal philosophy---especially that grounded on the work of John
Locke---tends to equate the sanctity of private property with liberty,
**it is a big leap to assume that liberalism abets an extreme
contemporary form of capitalism like neoliberalism**---an ill-defined
and overused term.]{.underline}6 Capitalism had not yet mutated into its
current form during the time of Locke. Hence, [by property rights,
Locke]{.underline} and the US founding fathers like Thomas Jefferson
[referred]{.underline} not to large corporations or finance capital but
[to landholdings]{.underline}, where liberty could be experienced as a
form of small-scale autonomy. In any case, **[nothing is outside
capitalism in today\'s world]{.underline}**. Hence, the question is no
longer whether liberalism abets this mode of production, because [even
illiberal regimes like Russia and China are capitalist]{.underline}. [It
is no doubt true that liberalism and liberal revolutions have not
abolished property and radically redistributed wealth. But what system
has sustainably done these things without economic collapse or
tremendous loss of life?]{.underline} **[Today, it is more crucial to
ask what baseline political measures allow us to negotiate the
market-driven present]{.underline}**, while we wait for the radicals to
conjure their alternatives. It is for this reason that Keith Hart
believes in [a \"liberal revolution\" for Africa]{.underline} that will
guarantee property rights for small farmers and businessmen, easily
threatened by patrimonial states (2015, 78). This revolution [would not
constitute neoliberalism]{.underline}, as Hart believes that a [respect
for property rights can come in tandem with an East-Asian style
developmentalism]{.underline}, which places a burden on the state as
economic manager. Second, on a more conceptual level, [it is also true
that the liberal belief in human and property rights is premised on an
individualistic conception of ethics]{.underline}. **[But what is wrong
with an individual conception of rights when also tempered by collective
action?]{.underline}** Are rights not even more necessary in the Global
South, where, as I show below in the case of the Philippines, they are
more precarious? **[And is it not an essentialist oversimplification to
pit global/Western individualism against collectivism in the Global
South?]{.underline}** As we will see below, **[creating a binary between
a liberal democratic North and a collectivist South easily slides into a
rhetoric that exploits anti-Western sentiment to further anti-democratic
centralization.]{.underline}** We must insist on the value of collective
action even as we recognize the value of individual rights. In all the
criticisms cited above, [critics reduce liberalism to a static idea,
holding it up to the most stringent criteria, which are not equally
applied to other existing political models]{.underline}. (To muster such
vitriol against Marxism would certainly elicit accusations of fascistic
anti-Communism). But [any nuanced history of liberal thought must
acknowledge the steady expansion of liberalism\'s political and ethical
horizons]{.underline}. Edmund Fawcett, for example, has shown how
[liberalism, which began as a credo of the elites (liberty for a select
few) grew into liberal democracy]{.underline} in the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries and \[End Page 99\] thus became a grammar for mass
politics (2014, 143). Thus, while we may concede that liberal ideas have
previously marginalized women, the poor, and various racial others,
**[we must also note its historical capacity for
self-correction]{.underline}**. Scholars like Mehta or Go are quick to
point out liberalism\'s sins but neglect how relatively quickly some of
these sins were rectified. Liberalism\'s expansiveness is present even
in the US-based civic-liberalism that scholars like Go deride. For, as
Richard Rorty reminds us, while the United States has had a history of
subjugation and hypocrisy, its greatest minds, such as Walt Whitman and
John Dewey, constantly infused their critiques with a vision of what a
more inclusive US society could be in the future (1997, 8). [The liberal
experiment, always in the process of becoming, was premised on
\"replacing shared knowledge of what is already real with social hope
for what might become real\"]{.underline} (18). **[Liberalism is an idea
centered on progress, and progress assumes that mistakes were once made.
Otherwise, what are we to progress from?]{.underline}** [Much of
anti-liberal postcolonial theorization is built on straw men, based on
incomplete histories of both Northern and Southern liberalisms, and on
assumptions about political models that have not or cannot be
tested]{.underline}. More importantly, **[these critiques do not
seriously consider their implications in the Global South, where
problems like poverty and violence are immediate and pressing, making
ameliorative reform more urgent]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[the
institutional blueprint of a liberal democracy is necessary to maintain
a baseline of politics that prevents the excesses of authoritarianism
and the ethical relativism that enables it]{.underline}**. As Dipesh
Chakrabarty prosaically yet correctly concedes, \"we do not in modernity
and as yet, know of desirable institutional arrangements in public life
that could be seriously built on principles other than those of
liberalism\" (emphasis in original, 2001, 126). When those desirable
institutional arrangements collapse, polities enter periods of violent
crisis. This is currently happening in the Philippines.

### Critics Wrong -- Mehta and Go

#### Mehta and Go disregard the "second face" of liberalism -- modus vivendi, which allows for pluralism

**Claudio, Associate Professor at the Department of History, De La Salle
University, 17** -- (Lisandro E., \"Defending Liberalism in the Global
South: Notes from Duterte\'s Philippines,\" The Global South, vol. 11

/ncp-AW

Postcolonialism Against Liberalism Any response to the vast postcolonial
literature against liberalism will, of course, be partial. In what
follows, I distill anti-liberal postcolonialism/theory from the South
into three claims, cite scholars that voice these views, and provide
responses to these in defense of liberalism. [First is the claim that
liberalism is a universalizing Enlightenment idea that has imposed
itself on colonial societies]{.underline}. In displacing other forms of
non-Western thinking, [critics say it creates a hierarchy]{.underline}
between a civilized/liberal subject and an uncivilized/illiberal one,
[thus allowing for the violence of colonialism]{.underline}. The most
prominent writer in this vein is Uday Singh [Mehta]{.underline} (1999),
who [argues that imperialism was]{.underline} [not a contradiction
within liberal thought but inherent in it.]{.underline}2 Through
colonialism, he contends, liberalism \"found a project, with all the
grandeur of scale, implicit permanence, purposefulness, and the absence
of a need to negotiate with what is extant\" (12). [Mehta based his
account largely on a critique of British liberalism and its effects on
colonial India]{.underline}. But others have applied his arguments to
other liberal empires. By examining the United States\' colonial
expansion in the late nineteenth century, Julian Go challenges the
narrative of an inclusive liberal nationalism in the US. He contends
that \[End Page 95\] one must think of \"civic-liberal nations as
liberal empire-states\" (emphasis in original, 2017, 74). Drawing from
the influential anti-liberalism of Losurdo (2014), Go claims that both
\"are predicated upon a core hierarchized binary of citizen and
Other---that is, between those who are members of the community because
they are rational, mature, and civilized, and those who are not\" (74).
It is in this manner, he concludes, that US liberalism has excluded
various subaltern groups, from African-American slaves to colonial-era
Filipinos. [To the critique exemplified by Mehta and Go, I offer two
replies.]{.underline} [First, liberalism\'s universalism does not
necessarily lead to colonialism]{.underline}. **[In fact, is it
reasonable for a liberal who believes in rational deliberation to
violently impose a set of beliefs on entire peoples?]{.underline}**
[Scholars like Mehta]{.underline} are wont to emphasize the
universalizing desires of liberalism (its first face), but they [have
neglected its other face]{.underline}, what Gray calls liberalism as
modus vivendi---**[a liberalism that allows for \"common institutions in
which many forms of life can coexist\"]{.underline}** (2000, 6). A modus
vivendi cannot be colonialism. And neither is colonialism a way of
ordering liberty through institutions that enhance individual and
collective freedoms. I must concede that [at various points in
liberalism\'s history, the pendulum has swung towards its more
universalizing tendencies]{.underline}. [Yet to contend]{.underline}, as
anti-liberal postcolonial theorists do, [that liberalism is a
universalizing project]{.underline} that imposes itself on divergent
belief systems [relies on an incomplete vision]{.underline} of the
liberal project. A second reply relates to simple logic. **[It is, of
course, true that liberalism creates \"others.\" But what political
movement is bereft of an inside and outside?]{.underline}** Marxism
constructs the proletariat in relation to the bourgeoisie, nationalism
has foreigners, various forms of identity politics insist on the primacy
of specific subject positions over others, and religions have
non-believers. In the sense that it sees the world through a political
subject, [liberalism is no different from other philosophies that create
bonds of community]{.underline}. And [while philosophers have theorized
more fluid conceptions]{.underline} of political belonging---Deleuze and
Guattari\'s \"rhizomatic\" subjectivity (1988), which inspired Hardt and
Negri\'s conception of the amorphous \"multitude\" (2005)---[it is not
clear that these ideas have produced long-term movements or concrete
agendas]{.underline}, especially in the Global South.

### Critics Wrong -- Theory

#### Liberalism's ideals are inherently good -- critics ascribe incorrect qualities to it

**Fawcett, British political journalist and former chief correspondent
of The Economist, 14** -- (Edmund, Aeon, "Reclaiming Liberalism,"
<https://aeon.co/essays/liberal-ideals-are-not-yet-dead-but-more-relevant-than-ever>)
/ncp-AW

As for what liberals have stood for, well, surely liberals believe in
liberty? Indeed they do. But so do most non-liberals. Just about every
modern rival to liberalism has claimed to stand somehow on the side of
liberty. In The Communist Manifesto (1848), Karl Marx and Friedrich
Engels looked forward to a classless society in which 'the free
development of each' individual was 'the condition for the free
development of all'. Benito Mussolini described Italian fascists as
'libertarians' who believed in liberty, even for their enemies. You
cannot leave liberty out of the story. Like the king in a game of chess,
liberty comes into its own near the end of the game. For all its
crowning appeal, [liberty is the wrong place to begin.]{.underline} At
its broadest, [liberalism is about improving people's lives while
treating them alike and shielding them from undue power.]{.underline}
Four ideas in particular seem to have guided liberals through their
history. The first is that [**the clash of interests and beliefs in
society is inescapable**. Social harmony]{.underline}, the nostalgic
dream of conservatives and the brotherly hope of socialists, [is neither
achievable nor desirable]{.underline} -- because harmony stifles
creativity and blocks initiative. Meanwhile [conflict]{.underline}, if
tamed and put to use as competition in a stable political order, [could
bear fruit as argument, experiment and exchange.]{.underline} Secondly,
**[human power is not to be trusted]{.underline}**. However well power
behaves, [it cannot be counted on to behave well]{.underline}. Be it the
power of state, market, social majorities or ethical authorities, the
superior power of some people over others tends inevitably to
arbitrariness and domination unless resisted and checked. [Preventing
the domination of society by any one interest, faith or class is,
accordingly, a cardinal liberal aim]{.underline}. Liberals also hold
that, [contrary to traditional wisdom, human life can
improve]{.underline}. **[Progress for the better is both possible and
desirable]{.underline}**, for society as a whole and for people one by
one, through education above all, particularly moral education. Finally,
**[the framework of public life has to show everyone civic
respect]{.underline}**, whatever they believe and whoever they are. Such
respect requires not intruding on people's property or privacy; not
obstructing their chosen aims and enterprises; and not excluding anyone
from such protections and permissions because they're useless to society
or socially despised. Together, those four ideas have given [liberalism
a characteristic outlook with a high measure of unity and
continuity]{.underline}, under a troubled surface of conflicting
vocabularies and competing strategies of justification. The liberal way
to hold to these four ideas is to insist on them all, without trying to
sacrifice some to others, or put one in absolute command. Though few
have used the capital-L label 'Liberal', the political parties of the
progressive mainstream in Europe and the United States have all held to
these ideas in recognisable degree. In France after 1870, for example,
the term 'liberal' practically vanished from party politics, but this
was a verbal, not a factual extinction. Liberalism persisted in France
as the progressive mainstream of politics, with right-wing liberals
known as Republicans and left-wing liberals known as Radicals. These
four key ideas also distinguished liberals, point for point, from
19th-century socialists and conservatives, and in the 20th century from
fascists and communists. They continue to distinguish liberals from
their present-day rivals: competitive authoritarianism (China), ethnic
nationalism (India), military populism (Egypt, Venezuela), nationalist
Islamism (Turkey) and theocratic Islamism (Iran). [By insisting on
pursuing all its ideals at once and in parallel, liberalism made a high
bid]{.underline}. It was never easy to better people's lives while
letting them alone, nor was it ever easy to respect people's beliefs
while improving their minds. At the same time government could protect
markets from state power, or people from market power, and give
majorities their say while protecting minorities. Liberalism's high bid
has made it [a doctrine of hope but equally an engine of
disappointment]{.underline}, which brings us back to those contrasting
sanguine and gloomy visions offered by Popper and Hobsbawm. One thing to
remember is that liberal self-doubt is nothing new. Pick any decade
between George Dangerfield's The Strange Death of Liberal England (1935)
and H W Brands's The Strange Death of American Liberalism (2001) and you
will find an anxious liberal author with a fresh diagnosis or a new
obituary. Nor should we be swept away by over-general theoretical claims
that caricature the liberal outlook, invoking vague sociology to
discredit liberal ideas. John Hallowell, for example, argued in The
Decline of Liberalism as an Ideology (1943) that mass society had
neutered the liberal ideal of personal autonomy. Going the opposite way,
other thinkers have blamed liberal ideas for gravely injuring society.
In After Virtue (1981), Alasdair MacIntyre argued that liberal
individualism has undermined community and solidarity. **[A common
strategy among liberalism's critics is to burden it with doctrinal
freight of a justificatory kind that it does not need and that many
liberals have never subscribed to]{.underline}**. Instead of focusing on
higher methodology and philosophy, **[we should concentrate on where
actual liberalism is going wrong]{.underline}**.

### Negative Rights Key

#### Alternatives to liberalism are worse- it's key to maintain neutrality and equality

**Kwan**, Associate Professor for Religion and Philosophy at Hong Kong
Baptist University, **14**

(Kai-man, Society, Volume 51 Issue 4 p. 383-384, DG)

In "Autonomy, Functionalism, and the Common Good: Some Liberal Doubts
about the New Golden Rule" (Lund 2000), William [Lund examines Etzioni's
conception of autonomy from the perspective of an egalitarian liberal,
alleging that his emphasis on special goods will lead to authoritarian
threats of negative liberty.]{.underline} For Lund, "most of ...
\[Etzioni's\] [weaknesses stem from certain ambiguities and tensions in
his conception and justifications of autonomy]{.underline}... his
account of autonomy and its basic value rests on a teleological core of
functional or ethical goods. That core, in turn, tends to support
particular conceptions of public authority and equality, the
implications of which yield significant doubts about the real meaning
and status of autonomy in his good society" (Lund 2000:2). For Etzioni,
autonomy includes both negative and positive liberties. As a liberal, it
is not suprising that [Lund expresses worries about the idea of positive
liberty. "By referring to positive liberties, he \[Etzioni\] opens a
door to defining autonomy in terms of a particular substance for the
'value, needs, and preferences' the good society is to
respect"]{.underline} (Lund 2000:7). A clear illustration is Etzioni's
emphasis on the struggle between a lower self and a higher self (a
debased and a nobler self[). The danger is to define autonomy as a
matter of achieving a particular notion of the good, which then "yields
clear threats to negative liberty]{.underline}" (Lund 2000:7): "if the
state is supposed to promote such autonomy, then we confront Isaiah
Berlin's (and others') nightmares about citizens being 'forced to be
free' through policies that ovverride individual judgments about
desirable lives in the name of 'genuine' freedom and a particular
content for such lives" (Lund 2000:8). So a connection between autonomy
and positive liberty may prove to be coercive. Lund then examines
Etzioni's treatment of the connection between autonomy and negative
liberties. Lund believes that Etzioni has offered two distinct
justfications for autonomy. One is a functionalist justification, which
claims that "the 'social virtue' of autonomy will enable societies to
avoid longrun, destructive problems, ... and enhances the ability of
society to adapt to change, to be metastable" (Lund 2000:8). The other
strategy is to justify autonomy as a selfevident good which is grounded
in an innate moral sense or a kind of deontology. [Although Lund
recognizes that Etzioni sometimes speaks of autonomy as "a constitutive
and noninstrumental good" (Lund 2000:10), he is still worried that the
nonconsequentialist justification of autonomy will ultimately collapse
into the functionalist justification: "autonomy is defined and valuable
only as a metaphysically base for behavior that meets the functional
test... and we are left with more conservative and autonomy-denying
implication]{.underline}" (Lund 2000:11). Even if we assume that the
functionalist and deontological justifiations are both basic and
distinct justifications of autonomy, we still need to face the problem
of conflict when these two justifications pull in different directions.
Lund thinks that here "Etzioni leaves us to engage in ad hoc balancing
of competing values and justifications in such cases," and "we are
naturally enough led to questions of political authority" (Lund
2000:11). Lund appeals to Richard Flathman's distinction between the
"formal-procedural" conception of authority and the
"substantive-purposive" conception of authority. He then points out that
Etzioni's approach will lead to a "substantive-purposive" account of
authority with "its presumption of inequality regarding capacities to
determine which questions should be matters of public concern and how
they should be resolved... In that case, there are obvious dangers for
negative Soc (2014) 51:380--388 383 liberty as Etzioni invites public
rules that override supposedly inferior individual judgments about the
best balance of conflicting values on the basis of authoritative
functional claims" (Lund 2000:12). Moreover, Etzioni "maintains the
maximization formula and simply plugs in a substitute conception of the
good whose incidence is to be increased... it still leaves him working
very closely to the more explicit teleologies of some of his
communitarian allies and his conservative opponents[. Such views ride
rather roughly with both negative liberty and the inner endorsement
aspects of autonomy since, if we can increase the incidence of an
agent-neutral good by coercion or manipulation, we will still be
maximizing value whether or not it is accepted as such by those who will
have to enact it" (Lund 2000:15). This "will tend to undermine the best
understanding of citizens' moral equality. In expanding the scope of
politics and in denying room for principled constraints on the
authoritative imposition of either functionalist or moral sense
conceptions of the good, Etzioni risks outcomes that could reasonably be
rejected by those who will have to live under them"]{.underline} (Lund
2000:16). For Lund, ["the best conception of equal respect requires the
public's role to be limited to the provisions of a minimal framework of
rules enforcing justice and reciprocal rights... Thus any public
balancing must be constrained by the neutrality requirement" (Lund
2000:16). So "the chief problem here should be protecting those who find
themselves falling outside those 'affect-laden relationships' or at odds
with 'the shared values, norms, and meanings' of a particular community"
(Lund 2000:18). Lund concludes that "the liberalism of equal respect for
negative liberty, stringent individual rights, and public neutrality on
the proper balance between conflicting ethical requirements may still be
the best course for those who want to take autonomy seriously" (Lund
2000:19).]{.underline}

pluralist choice goes as follows. Principles capable of guiding ethical
and political choice not just within particular local contexts but
across a generality of contexts can be arrived at by reflection on the
idea of value pluralism itself. Such principles will not always, or even
often, identify uniquely rational solutions to conflicts among
incommensurables in particular cases-that will be possible, if at all,
only by means of the particularist or contextual kind of decision making
already sketched. [The universal and particularist accounts of pluralist
choice are not rival accounts but complementary.]{.underline} The
[universal principles]{.underline} implicit in value pluralism will
[serve to frame particular decisions, to narrow down the range of
acceptable options.]{.underline} These principles help to shape,
although they do not determine, particular choices under pluralism.
**[Moreover, they amount to a distinctively liberal framework for such
choices.]{.underline}** [They point towards liberalism either by ruling
out, or at least weighing against, non-liberal forms of politics, or by
commending liberalism directly.]{.underline} Here I discuss four such
principles: respect for universal values, acknowledgment of value
incommensurability and its implications, promotion of a diversity of
goods and ways of life, and the exercise of the virtues necessary for
practical reasoning under pluralism. I deal only briefly with the first
two principles, since it is the others that generate the strongest
arguments for liberalism. First, [the pluralist view that at least some
values are universal implies a commitment to universal respect for those
values]{.underline}. The life of an individual or a society that fails
to respect any of the universal values cannot, to that extent, be
desirable. [The effect of this is to rule out]{.underline} as
unacceptable from a pluralist point of view [the more strongly
relativist views of political norms]{.underline}, which deny such
universals. These include, on the one hand, the kind of cultural
conservatism or strong communitarianism that insists on the
unimpeachable authority of existing tradition (Kekes 1993, 1997, 1998;
Maclntyre 1985, 1988), and, on the other hand, postmodernist views that
purport to reject all universals and to treat all local narratives as on
a moral par (Lyotard I984; White 1991). Second, important practical
implications also follow from the incommensurabil- ity of values. If
values are incommensurable, then the losses that result from trade-offs
cannot be wholly compensated but will inevitably possess an absolute and
perhaps (if the stakes are high enough) tragic quality. To acknowledge
the truth of pluralism is thus to recognise the seriousness of personal
and public policy decisions that require trade-offs among important
values. [Pluralism encourages us to face up to the fact that such
decisions have real costs, and not to hide behind comforting notions of
\'the greater good\' or the end justifying the means]{.underline}.
Conse- quently, incommensurability implies the futility of political
visions that anticipate the elimination of real loss and confiict in
human life, visions such as those of Marxism and anarchism in their
classical forms. This is one of the principal themes emphasised by
Berlin. So far, the implications of value pluralism have more to do with
ruling out the ideological opponents of liberalism than with positive
recommendation of liberal- ism itself. The principle of universality
does hint at such recommendation in that the desirable society will be
one in which at least some moral principles are regarded as more
fundamental than local law and custom, suggesting the begin- nings of a
case for a minimal set of human rights.8 Also, the principle of
incommensurability implies that [the good society will be one which
accepts some substantial degree of social conflict as permanent and
seeks to mitigate rather than transcend that conflict]{.underline},
again [pointing to a system of corrective enforceable
rights]{.underline} rather than the utopian goal of social harmony
beyond the need for enforcement. But [the pluralist outlook begins to
take on a more distinctively liberal shape when we add]{.underline} to
the lessons of universality and incommensurability [a consideration of
the final two elements of pluralism, plurality and
conflict]{.underline}. When all the elements of pluralism are taken
together, they generate the two principal arguments from pluralism to
liberalism that I foreshadowed in the introduction, the arguments from,
respectively, diversity and the virtues. The basic claim made by the
first of these arguments is that [to acknowledge the truth of value
pluralism is to endorse the promotion within a given social arena of the
widest possible diversity of human values, a goal maximally satisfied
under liberalism]{.underline}. The argument can be divided into two main
steps: the first from pluralism to an ethic of \'diversity\', and the
second from diversity to liberalism. First, to accept that there are
plural and incommensurable goods is not merely to allow that certain
things are believed by some people to be good but also to endorse those
things as objective goods since they contribute to human flourishing.
Furthermore, the pluralist must endorse all such goods equally, in the
sense that they have an equal claim on us until we have a reason to
choose among them. The plural goods are incommensurable, and so cannot
be said to be measurably equal, but they are, in Berlin\'s words,
\'equally ultimate\' (Berlin 1969, 168; 2002, 213). It follows that [the
pluralist outlook commits us to respecting the full range of human
goods]{.underline}. To respect the full range of human goods is to
[endorse their promotion as far as possible in a particular
situation]{.underline}. Since all these goods must be respected equally,
it follows that [in any particular situation it is desirable, prima
facie, that as many of them as possible be promoted]{.underline}.
Pluralism implies the desirability of value diversity. **[To promote as
many values as possible in a given situation is to pursue a policy of
moderation in one\'s choices]{.underline}**. One will acknowledge and
balance, or reach a compromise among, several, perhaps many, distinct
considerations rather than insisting single-mindedly or fanatically on
some single end or narrow range of ends. It might be objected that this
will be true only if we smuggle into the argument broadly moderate or
liberal assumptions that are not warranted by value pluralism itself.
Consistently with allowing the truth of value pluralism, it might be
said, someone can still embrace or commend single-mindedness, even
extremism or fanaticism: \'Yes, there are many different values, but I
choose this one and reject all others.\' An extremist or chauvinist of
this kind cannot be a consistent value pluralist because he or she fails
genuinely to appreciate the multiplicity of human goods as required by
value pluralism. lf value pluralism is true, then there are several,
perhaps many, genuine human goods[. To acknowledge the weight of all
such goods]{.underline}, not just those we arbitrarily prefer or with
which we happen to be brought up, [is a duty that follows from the idea
of value pluralism itself.]{.underline} It is required not by any
smuggled liberal assumption but by the logic of the value-pluralist
position. Of course, not all human goods can be realised simultaneously,
and in particular situations choices must be made. But those choices
must be made, by the consistent value pluralist, in a spirit of
'generosity' towards the full range of human goods rather than a mood of
arbitrary single-mindedness (Walzer 1995; Galston 1999b,777). Indeed, I
shall argue later that the value-pluralist outlook implies the
acceptance of this kind of generosity as one of the virtues required for
good practical reasoning (and therefore the best lives) under pluralism.
[The logic of pluralism itself pushes us towards moderation]{.underline}
rather than narrowness or fanaticism in our choices among conflicting
plural values. But if value pluralism requires moderation, [does it
necessarily require liberal moderation?]{.underline} The second step in
the argument is the claim that **[the promotion of diversity is best
accommodated by a liberal political order.]{.underline}** [One of the
historic goals of liberalism is to provide a political framework for the
peaceful pursuit of diverse goods]{.underline}, originally a diversity
of religious faiths, more lately a diversity of values and ways of life
more generally. In recent times this line of liberal justification has
taken the form of the liberal \'neutrality\' advocated by thinkers such
as Rawls (l97l, I993) and Dworkin (I977, I985). On this view, a liberal
political order is no more than the minimal framework of principles
necessary to pennit or enable individuals and groups to pursue divergent
ways of life without coming into harmful collision. The framework is
neutral both in the sense of being even-handed in its effect on
different ways of life, and in being defined indepen- dently of any
particular substantial way of life. Pluralist liberals can thus argue
that [liberal neutrality is able to accommodate the moral diversity
required by value pluralism.]{.underline} This argument seems open to
the familiar objection that liberalism is not truly neutral. In the
context of pluralism the point is forcefully expressed by Gray, who
agrees that pluralism implies a commitment to moral diversity but denies
that this is best satisfied by accepting liberalism as a framework.
Liberalism, according to Gray, accommodates different ways of life only
at the cost of sanitising them, reshaping them in its own image (Gray
1995a, 154). A world in which liberalism is only one way of life among
others would be more diverse than one in which all cultures were
subjected to liberal restraints, hence more desirable from a pluralist
point of view. Pluralists need not, indeed should not, accept liberalism
universally. Liberals might reply as follows. First, [Gray\'s objection
is essentially that liberalism does not maximise diversity because it is
not wholly neutral.]{.underline} But even if that is true, [**it may
still be argued that liberalism is at least \'approximately\' neutral**,
that is, more accommodating of different values than any alternative
political form]{.underline} (Kekes 1997, 175). As noted above, the range
and diversity of human values is such that not all genuine goods can be
realised within the same \'social space\' (Rawls 1993, 57).
Consequently, [any political order must involve some ranking of
goods]{.underline}. The pluralist ethic of diversity can realistically
require no more than that the political ranking endorsed by a given
society be as accommodating to diversity as possible in the
circumstances and more accommodating than the alternatives. Liberals
should concede that [liberalism is not unlimited in its capacity to
accommodate diversity, but]{.underline} they can plausibly argue that
**[the goal of diversity is more fully satisfied by liberal principles
and institutions than by any other.]{.underline}** Second, we should be
careful about the meaning of the \'diversity\' commended by pluralism.
This cannot be, as Gray seems to assume, a simple injunction to promote
more rather than fewer goods without regard to their content or the
relations among them, since the pursuit of some values may impede the
realisation of others. The maximising dimension of pluralist diversity
must therefore be supplemented by a second kind of consideration, namely
that of coherence among the values to be promoted. The available values
must cohere with one another at least to the minimum degree that they
fit together within the horizon of real possibility for the individual
or society concerned, given the person\'s or the society\'s experience
and identity. Also, in addition to being realistic prospects. the values
in question should not be so widely scattered or fragmented that their
pursuit can only be half-hearted or self-defeating. The goods should
therefore cohere sufficiently that all may be taken seriously (Kekes
1993, 97-8). [Given that pluralist diversity requires not only
multiplicity but also coherence, **liberalism has a strong claim to be
seen as striking the required balance**]{.underline}. As to
multiplicity. the liberal emphasis on individual liberties and rights
clears a private space for the pursuit of many different values. whether
embodied in personal projects or collective ways of life. Again. this
will not be limitless. but it is considerable. especially when compared
with the restrictions imposed by alterna- tive views such as those of
the cultural conservatism or strong communitarianism sometimes
countenanced by Gray. On the other hand, the limits that liberal
liberties and rights place on the range of values, projects and ways of
life that may be legitimately pursued within a society are [limits
designed to prevent these from coming into destructive collision with
one another]{.underline}. They are limits that create coherence. A final
reply to Gray is that when pluralists commend \'diversity\' we should
also ask: diversity of what\'? Gray supposes that the diversity that
pluralists favour must be primarily a diversity of cultures, from which
it seems to follow that some cultures ought to be illiberal in the name
of diversity. That view assumes that under value pluralism cultures are
incommensurable in just the same way, and tojust the same extent, as
goods. But if that were so, there would be no distinction between value
pluralism and cultural relativism, because if cultures were
incommensurable they would each constitute an unimpeachable moral
authority, precisely the claim of relativism. [The basic problem with
Gray\'s position is that it confuses value pluralism with cultural
relativism]{.underline}. On the pluralist view, contrary to relativism,
**[cultures are not indefeasible moral authorities. because they can be
criticised from the pluralist perspective: some may meet the normative
standards of pluralism more completely than others]{.underline}**. One
of those standards is value diversity. which must apply within as well
as among cultures. Pluralists are therefore obliged to support cultural
diversity only so far as the cultures in question are themselves
internally diverse- or at any rate, a pluralist must rank a diversity of
internally monistic cultures lower in value than a diversity of
internally diverse cultures. It follows that, even if it were conceded
that liberalism did not, on balance, promote cultural diversity, it
could still be argued that [liberalism does promote the kind of
diversity commended by value pluralists]{.underline}, namely a diversity
of goods. But in any case the diversity of values internal to cultures
that is promoted by liberalism is likely to lead to greater diversity
among cultures after all (Johnston I994, 27). Because of their internal
diversity, liberal societies will develop along different lines, and
that will result in increased external diversity. A world composed
entirely of liberal societies would still be a world in which societies
are very different from one another. Even on the score of cultural
diversity there is therefore more to be said for liberalism than Gray
allows. To sum up the diversity argument. value pluralism suggests a
commitment to the promotion of the greatest. possible diversity of
goods, and. secondarily, internally diverse cultures. That diversity is
best accommodated by the approximate neutrality of which liberalism is
capable. Gray\'s objections to this line of argument rest on
misunderstandings of value pluralism, and consequently of the kind of
diversity that pluralists should value.

### 2AC - Reform Possible - TL

#### Liberalism can empirically be reformed -- it evolves according to its historical context

**Starr, founding co-editor of The American Prospect and professor of
sociology and public affairs at Princeton University, 07** -- (Paul,
\"Why Liberalism Works,\" The American Prospect (April 2007), 34-40,

/ncp-AW

[Liberalism is deeply rooted in American soil]{.underline}, so much so
that in the years after World War II, many historians and social
scientists regarded the [liberal project and the American civic creed as
more or less the same]{.underline}. The proposition that each of us has
a right to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" remains as good
a definition as anyone has ever come up with of liberalism's first
principle and America's historic promise. For some time, however,
[contemporary liberalism has been under political siege]{.underline} in
the United States, and even liberals have at times appeared uncertain
about what they stand for. In recent decades, national political leaders
who are unquestion-ably liberal have often been unwilling to say so and
unable to articulate a compelling public philosophy, while
public-opinion surveys show that many Americans who support liberal
posi-tions do not identify themselves as liberals. **[Lately, though,
the right has been facing its own loss of confi-dence]{.underline}**. No
one, not even conservatives, doubts that conservatism is now in deep
trouble: divided, uncertain of itself, and with a lot of explaining to
do for the fiasco in Iraq. [Yet the exhaustion of conservatism is not
tantamount to a liberal revival]{.underline}. The Bush administration's
manifest failures and the Democrats' triumph in the 2006 elections have
created a new opening for liberal argument. The question is now whether
liberals can make their case not just for specific policies and
candidates but for an alternative public philosophy. The Bush years have
left America with more than just the disaster in Iraq to resolve.
Conservative political leadership has failed to confront, and in
critical respects has contributed to, some of our most serious long-term
problems: growing economic inequality and insecurity, structural
deficits in the federal budget, grave threats to the global environment,
and increased hostility abroad toward the United States. America needs a
different approach rooted in the inclusive, democratic partnerships that
are central to the modern liberal tradition---a partnership at home
built on the basis of a shared prosperity, and an international
partnership in power built on the basis of a cooperative framework of
security. At its heart, [the aim of the liberal project is today what it
has always been: to build a free, fair, and prosperous
society]{.underline}. But lib-eralism ought never to be confused with
mere high-mindedness; [it calls for a practical politics, whose ways and
means necessarily evolve]{.underline} in response to new conditions and
new understandings. A readiness to confront new conditions and absorb
the lessons of experience is all the more necessary in [a philosophy
that asks to be judged by its real effects on human freedom and
happiness and the power and peace of nations]{.underline}. Liberalism
stands not only for the principle that we all have an equal right to
freedom but also for the hypothesis that this is a workable ideal, and
that a politics based on liberal principles can produce the power and
wealth that make a free society more than a dream. Liberalism is
notoriously difficult to define. The term has been used to describe a
sprawling profusion of ideas, prac-tices, movements, and parties in
different societies and his-torical periods. [Often emerging as a
philosophy of opposition]{.underline}, whether to feudal privilege,
absolute monarchy, colonialism, theocracy, communism, or fascism,
[liberalism has served]{.underline}, as the word suggests, [as a force
for liberation]{.underline}, or at least liberaliza-tion---for the
opening up of channels of free initiative. As a political philosophy in
the Anglo-American world, liberalism has two primary senses. In its
broader meaning, it refers to the fundamental principles of
constitutional gov-ernment and individual rights shared by modern
liberals and conservatives, though often differently interpreted by
them. This tradition of constitutional liberalism---classical political
liberalism---emerged in the 17th and 18th centuries, culminated in the
American and French revolutions, and continues to pro-vide the
foundation of the modern liberal state. The classical liberals generally
stood for religious liberty, freedom of thought and speech, the division
of governmental powers, an indepen-dent civil society, and rights of
private property and economic freedom that evolved in the 19th century
into the doctrine of laissez-faire. Modern democratic liberalism
developed out of the more egalitarian aspects of the tradition and
serves as the basis of contemporary liberal politics. The relationship
between liberal-ism in these two phases has been predominantly
cumulative: Why Liberalism Works [Conservatism is in shambles; liberals
have a new opportunity.]{.underline} **[But what do they stand for? Not
mere high-mindedness.]{.underline}** [Liberalism is a practical strategy
for a free society---and for solving the mess conservatives will leave
behind.]{.underline} While rejecting laissez-faire economic policy,
modern liberal-ism continues to take the broader tradition of
constitutional liberalism as its foundation. That is why it is possible
to speak not only of the two separately but also of an overarching set
of ideas that unites them. Yet even within the Anglo-American liberal
tradition, intel-lectuals and reformers have started from different
premises about human nature, society, and history and have held
dif-ferent views about many matters of deep importance to them,
including religion. Historically, liberalism has been defined by a
shared, albeit evolving, body of political principles rather than by
agreement on the ultimate grounds on which those principles rest. One of
those shared political principles is [an equal right to
freedom]{.underline}, where freedom has been successively understood
dur-ing the past three centuries in a more expansive way: first, as a
right to civil liberty and freedom from arbitrary power; then, as a
right to political liberty and a share in the government; and finally,
as a right to basic requirements of human development and security
necessary to assure equal opportunity and personal dignity. Although I
have described these ideas as a series of rights, they [imply
correspond-ing responsibilities that a liberal society expects of its
members, individually and collectively]{.underline}. Inasmuch as
individuals enjoy rights to civil liberty and freedom from arbitrary
power, they are responsible for their own actions and what they make of
their lives. Inasmuch as citizens enjoy a right to political liberty and
a share of their government, they have the responsibilities of
citizenship to make democracy work. And inasmuch as the members of a
liberal society have a right to basic requirements of human development,
such as education and a minimum standard of security, they have
obligations to one another, mutually and through their government, to
ensure that conditions exist enabling every person to have the
oppor-tunity for success in life. [The liberal project may be defined as
the effort to guarantee these freedoms and to create the institutions
and forms of char-acter that will lead a people to assume
responsibility, not as an external burden imposed upon them but from a
force within.]{.underline} This is only a preliminary definition,
however, because liberties come into conflict with one another and with
other interests, and there must be a way of adjudicating among them that
is consistent with the deepest interests in freedom and the public good.
Moreover, **[liberalism consists of principles not only for a just
society but also for the design of a state capable of sustain-ing that
society in a world that is far from ideal]{.underline}**. This concern
for creating a capable and effective state is criti-cal to understanding
how and why liberalism works. Constitu-tionalism itself, and even more
so a liberal constitution with its emphasis on the protection of
individual rights, is [a system of enabling constraints]{.underline}.
The constraints shie[ld individuals from tyranny, but they also
strengthen the state's power to act on behalf of its
citizens.]{.underline} Checks and balances, requirements for
transparency in decision making, and public accountability for
performance reduce the odds of capricious, reckless, or self-interested
decisions by those in power. Public discussion invites ideas and
information that autocrats do not receive or are unlikely to heed. A
constitutional state that observes the rule of law is more likely to
abide by its promises, pay its debts, and enjoy better credit and lower
interest rates. Guarantees of rights, including property rights, enable
individuals to make long-term plans and investments and create a more
productive economy that redounds to general advantage. Guarantees of
religious freedom allow people of different faiths to cooperate under a
political order that does not threaten to extinguish any of the various
theological doctrines they support. In short, it is an error to see
guarantees of liberty as a source of state weakness. From its beginnings
in 17th- and 18th-century England and America, constitutional liberalism
contributed to the development of states that proved not only
economically but also militarily successful, even when challenged by
regimes more devoted to martial values. [The classical liberal
tradition, however, had severe limitations]{.underline}. The liberalism
of the 18th and early 19th centuries was not democratic in a sense we
would recog-nize today: The majority of people---men without property,
racial minorities, and women---were denied political rights and full
citizenship. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, laissez-faire
economics provided a framework of law and policy for industrial
capitalism's dynamic growth, but it left most work-ing people in
insecurity and poverty. In the same era, [while often favoring social
reform at home, liberal imperialists supported Western
colonialism]{.underline}. The resulting conflicts and disasters nearly
brought liberalism to ruin. The old liberal order of limited government,
classical economics, and colonialism went up in flames amid total war
and the Great Depression, and fascism or communism could easily have
emerged from the wreckage to dominate the world. **[Modern liberalism,
however, transformed its classical inheri-tance into a genuinely
democratic politics that proved stron-ger and more effective in both war
and peace than its critics expected]{.underline}**. Liberals now called
for true political equality for all, aimed to bring raw capitalism under
control in the interests of an expanded circle of opportunity, and
supported national self-determination for all peoples and new forms of
coopera-tion among states to promote democracy, human rights, and
international peace and security. Every step of the way, conservatives
objected to these move-ments toward a wider democratic partnership, but
as of the mid-20th century, liberals had won the argument decisively and
had built an electoral majority in support of it. The prevailing view in
the liberal democracies held that [the extension of politi-cal and
social rights and economic regulation was not only just but also the
basis of a more productive society.]{.underline} And [cooperative
international organization]{.underline}, far from being a naive
delusion, [was plainly necessary]{.underline} to meet the twin threats
posed by communism, on the one hand, and nuclear extinction, on the
other.

#### Liberalism empirically has been reformed

**The Economist 18** -- ("Liberalism is the most successful idea of the
past 400 years," The Economist,
<https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2018/01/27/liberalism-is-the-most-successful-idea-of-the-past-400-years>)
/ncp-AW

OVER the past four centuries [liberalism]{.underline} has been so
successful that it has driven all its opponents off the battlefield. Now
it [is disintegrating]{.underline}, destroyed by a mix of hubris and
internal contradictions, according to Patrick Deneen, a professor of
politics at the University of Notre Dame. The gathering wreckage of
liberalism's twilight years can be seen all around, **[especially in
America]{.underline}**, Mr Deneen's main focus. The founding tenets of
the faith have been shattered. Equality of opportunity has produced **[a
new meritocratic aristocracy]{.underline}** that has all the aloofness
of the old aristocracy with none of its sense of noblesse oblige.
[Democracy has degenerated into a theatre of the absurd]{.underline}.
And [technological advances are reducing ever more areas of work into
meaningless drudgery]{.underline}. "The gap between liberalism's claims
about itself and the lived reality of the citizenry" is now so wide that
"the lie can no longer be accepted," Mr Deneen writes. What better proof
of this than the vision of 1,000 private planes whisking their occupants
to Davos to discuss the question of "creating a shared future in a
fragmented world"? Mr Deneen uses the term "liberalism" in its
philosophical rather than its popular sense. He is describing the great
tradition of political theory that is commonly traced to Thomas Hobbes
and John Locke rather than the set of vaguely leftish attitudes that
Americans now associate with the word. But this is no work of
philosophical cud-chewing. Most political theorists argue that
[liberalism has divided into two independent streams: classical
liberalism]{.underline}, which celebrates the free market, [and
left-liberalism]{.underline} which celebrates civil rights. For Mr
Deneen they have an underlying unity. Most political observers think
that the debate about the state of liberalism has nothing to do with
them. Mr Deneen argues that [liberalism is a ruling
philosophy]{.underline}, dictating everything from court decisions to
corporate behaviour. Theory is practice. The underlying unity lies in
individual self-expression. Both classical and left liberals conceive of
humans as rights-bearing individuals who should be given as much space
as possible to fulfil their dreams. The aim of government is to secure
rights. The legitimacy of the system is based on a shared belief in a
"social contract" between consenting adults. But this produces a
paradox. Because the liberal spirit mechanically destroys inherited
customs and local traditions, sometimes in the name of market efficiency
and sometimes in the name of individual rights, it creates more room for
the expansion of the state, as marketmaker and law-enforcer. The perfect
expression of modern liberalism is provided by the frontispiece of
Hobbes's "Leviathan" (detail pictured), with its sketch of thousands of
atomised individuals confronted by an all-powerful sovereign. Mr Deneen
makes his case well, though he sometimes mistakes repetition for
persuasion. He reminds the reader that, before the advent of modern
liberalism, philosophers identified liberty with self-mastery rather
than self-expression, with the conquest of hedonistic desires rather
than their indulgence. [He does an impressive job of capturing the
current mood of disillusionment, echoing left-wing complaints about
rampant commercialism, right-wing complaints about narcissistic and
bullying students, and general worries about atomisation and
selfishness]{.underline}. But when he concludes that all this adds up to
a failure of liberalism, is his argument convincing? His book has two
fatal flaws. The first lies in his definition of liberalism. J.H.
Hexter, an American academic, believed his fellow historians could be
divided into two camps: "splitters" (who were forever making
distinctions) and "lumpers" (who make sweeping generalisations by
lumping things together). Mr Deneen is an extreme lumper. He [argues
that the essence of liberalism lies in freeing individuals from
constraints]{.underline}. [In fact, liberalism contains a wide range of
intellectual traditions which provide different answers to the question
of how to trade off the relative claims of rights and responsibilities,
individual expression and social ties.]{.underline} Even classical
liberals who were most insistent on removing constraints on individual
freedom agonised about atomisation. The mid-Victorians were great
institution-builders, creating everything from voluntary organisations
to joint-stock companies ("little republics" in the phrase of Robert
Lowe, a 19th-century British statesman) that were designed to fill the
space between the state and society. Later liberals experimented with a
range of ideas from devolving power from the centre to creating national
education systems. Mr Deneen's fixation on the essence of liberalism
leads to the second big problem of his book: [**his failure to recognise
liberalism's ability to reform itself and address its internal
problems**. The late 19th century saw America suffering from many of the
problems that are reappearing today, including the creation of a
business aristocracy, the rise of vast companies, the corruption of
politics and the sense that society was dividing into winners and
losers. **But a wide variety of reformers, working within the liberal
tradition, tackled these problems head on**]{.underline}. [Theodore
Roosevelt took on the trusts. Progressives cleaned up government
corruption. University reformers modernised academic syllabuses and
built ladders of opportunity.]{.underline} **[Rather than dying,
liberalism reformed itself.]{.underline}** Mr Deneen is right to point
out that the record of liberalism in recent years has been dismal. He is
also right to assert that the world has much to learn from the premodern
notions of liberty as self-mastery and self-denial. The biggest enemy of
liberalism is not so much atomisation but old-fashioned greed, as
members of the Davos elite pile their plates ever higher with perks and
share options. But [he is wrong to argue that the only way for people to
liberate themselves from the contradictions of liberalism is "liberation
from liberalism itself"]{.underline}. The best way to read "Why
Liberalism Failed" is not as a funeral oration but as **[a call to
action: up your game, or else.]{.underline}**

### 1AR -- Reform Possible - TL

#### It\'s possible and desirable to reform liberalism

**Moore**, Professor at Queen's University, **94**

(Margaret, The Review of Politics Vol. 56, No. 2 p. 373, DG)

[William A. Galston\'s]{.underline} important new book [Liberal Purposes
offers an interpretation of liberal theory and practice as embodying a
conception of human good which shapes liberal public policy, a liberal
conception of justice, and presupposes the practice of liberal
virtues.]{.underline} In Galston\'s view, [liberalism]{.underline} is
not, and cannot be, neutral toward all conceptions of the good; rather,
it [embraces a particular (albeit deliberately partial) conception of
the good, which it promotes in its public policy and conception of
justice.]{.underline} This positive thesis entails a critique of
antifoundationalists (chapter 2), communitarians (chapter 3), and
neutralist liberals, such as Rawls, Dworkin and Ackerman (chapters 4-7).
[Galston does not attempt a comprehensive survey of the communitarian
critique of liberalism, but he does offer his own]{.underline} careful
[critical assessment of three contemporary critics of
liberalism:]{.underline} Walzer, Unger, and MacIntyre. [He argues that
liberal theory has the conceptual resources to respond to the concerns
of its critics but that the neutralist liberalism currently in vogue
fails to meet the communitarian challenge,]{.underline} and fails to do
justice to liberal practice. This sets the stage for Part II of the
book, which offers a comprehensive and critical assessment of neutralist
liberal- ism. [On the neutrality defense of liberalism, the liberal
state is conceived as justified because neutral among different ways of
life, acting only to adjudi- cate conflict and to prevent any particular
way of life from tyrannizing over others.]{.underline} Neutralist
liberals, Galston argues, do presuppose a conception of the good in
their theories (pp. 91-93), and every polity embodies a more than
minimal conception of the good in their basic principles and policies
(p. 97). Chapter 5 critiques the argument from diversity, mainly
associated with Larmore, which contends that neutrality is an
appropriate response to the diversity of modern social life; and
chapters 6 and 7 examine Rawls\'s recent essays, arguing that Rawls\'s
attempt to construct a \"political\" liberalism that is substantially
neutral concerning questions of the human good also fails. [This leaves
Galston squarely in the camp of liberals,]{.underline} such as Brian
Barry and Stephen Macedo[, who defend liberalism by arguing in favor of
the worth of distinctively liberal ways of life. On this view, the
liberal state should not adopt a neutral stance toward different ways of
life, but should be designed to foster distinctively liberal virtues and
policies.]{.underline}

### Reform Possible - Dynamism

#### Liberalism is a living theory- it responds to challenges in American history in an era of rising identity politics

**Dumm**, Professor of Political Science at Amherst College, **96**

(Thomas, The American Political Review, Volume 90, Issue 4, p. 903-904,
DG)

One risks committing the error of oversimplification when briefly
reviewing as sweeping and thoroughly revisionist a study as this.
Indeed, one needs to warn the reader that any sketch of this book can
only serve as a gross reduction of a very carefully rendered reading of
the main threads of American political thought. Young does not
oversimplify. His core argument with Hartz consists of the idea that [if
one is to access adequately the power of liberalism through the course
of American history, one is compelled to complicate the narrative of
liberalism to account for the opponents it has attracted]{.underline}
(and sometimes produced) [and to appreciate the nuance of the core ideas
of liberalism and of its opponents,]{.underline} even the nuances of the
great simplifiers (such as Hartz himself). [He draws upon the
scholarship of hundreds of thinkers, major and minor, to trace the
thread of liberalism\'s contested history. By placing liberalism on the
field of contested ideas and within the struggles in American history
over slavery, free labor, segregation, communism, gender equality, and
multiculturalism, he shows how liberalism itself is a living theory, not
a rigid set of formulas unresponsive to the challenges it has faced, nor
merely \"enduring.\"]{.underline} Young retrieves the Puritan opposition
both to illuminate the various minority voices of American thought that
have been swept aside or ignored by the Hartzian-inspired liberal
literature of American exceptionalism and to connect the strands of
various contemporary critiques of liberalism together so that they might
better illuminate the conflictual character of liberalism\'s history.
This is a very ambitious agenda and one that for the most part succeeds.
And even when Young reaches conclusions that one might argue with, he
provides readers with the information needed to under- stand the
perspective on whatever school of thought he is explaining. [While
historical in perspective, this study is essentially an argument about
the emergence of the contemporary embattled state of liberalism. For
Young, the post-World War II era of liberalism is perhaps its most
endangered period. The challenge to fulfill the promise of rights to
minorities and women has generated reactions on both the right and left
and has resulted in a liberalism that seems on the
defensive.]{.underline} In an argument that echoes E. J. Dionne\'s
(1991) Vhy Americans Hate Politics, but which deepens Dionne\'s study of
the rise of the New Right and the New Left, [Young suggests that a
liberalism that finds its primary means of responding to injustice
through the extension of rights may have become unable to acknowledge
the myriad problems of the late modern era. Noting the rise of a kind of
identity politics]{.underline} that edges into fragmentation and
balkanization, on the one hand, [and a communitarianism that sometimes
edges into the simplicity of reactionary conservativism, on the other,
he suggests that contemporary liberals need to rethink the repertoire of
means available to advance the ends of individual dignity and
freedom.]{.underline}

#### Progress through reform is possible- liberalism isn't a monolithic philosophy but rather has the potential to right injustice

**Paris**, Forrest S. Crawford Fellow in Ethical Inquiry with the Rock
Ethics Institute, **18**

(William, Critical Philosophy of Race, Volume 6, Issue 1, p. 101-108,
DG)

[This raises a difficult issue since the equivocation in Shelby\'s text
forces us to ask, not what primary value from which the reasonable
person reflects, but by what evaluative schema is this value assessed
and put into play]{.underline}. For the nonideal observer may look at
the ghetto and instead of seeing a structural problem will see a
pathological disorder in need of intervention (by the police, most
often). Shelby circumvents this issue by moving to the register of the
ideal observer who presumably is not stained by racial or status-quo
bias and can adjudicate fairly whether reciprocity is in play \[End Page
104\] and, if not, how and in what way has there been a deviation. [This
move would only displace the issue rather than resolve it since the
ideal evaluative schema is not just any schema, but Black radical
liberalism. What if the schema were that of right libertarianism,
socialism, liberalism proper, or, most perniciously, latent white
supremacy? All of these ideal reasonable persons could presumably agree
with the value of reciprocity, but have radically divergent and
incommensurable manners for evaluating whether society has deviated from
this principle.]{.underline} Shelby implicitly responds to this problem
of equivocation by countering the abstract ideal observer with the
nonideal Black urban poor as the reasonable person to whom we turn for
an evaluation of reciprocity in the basic structure: The ghetto poor are
often viewed as either helpless victims of injustice or a menace to
society. Their political acts of defiance are therefore generally
regarded as posturing, treated as misguided, ignored altogether, or
actively repressed. Yet some actions of the ghetto poor that are
interpreted as deviant or pathological should instead be understood as
moral responses to injustice. By looking at their conduct this way, we
gain insight into the political ethics of the unjustly disadvantaged and
can better evaluate when these responses are reasonable and permissible
or blameworthy and self-defeating. (14; emphasis mine) In the
highlighted sentence Shelby does not turn to the ghetto poor as simply
one \"point of view\" amongst others. He treats these nonideal subjects
as the ideal subjects according to whom we ought to evaluate the
principle of reciprocity and its deviations within a society structured
by racism. In short, Shelby\'s Dark Ghettos is structurally a work of
racial valuing. [This project of racial valuing certainly provides new
avenues of investigation into one of the principles of nonideal theory:
political ethics.]{.underline} But it will encounter problems for Shelby
in the elaboration of principles of reform and revolution (12). Insofar
as his evaluative schema begs the question of reform against revolution
even as he proposes that this is the conclusion that is to be proven.
[For there is much distance between arguing that the basic structure of
society can be reformed over time to be more in line with the value of
reciprocity and reasonably concluding that a revolution of the structure
is necessary to uproot racial injustice and form a more just
structure.]{.underline} The crux of this issue arises in Shelby\'s
powerful chapter, \"Crime,\" where he assesses whether the ghetto poor
have an obligation to obey the \[End Page 105\] laws of an unjust
society. Through Rawls, Shelby \"maintains that we do not have
obligations to submit to unjust institutions \[such as the police\], or
at least not to institutions that exceed the limits of tolerable
injustice\" (214; emphasis mine). Since law and laws are conceived as
what holds civil society together the question of how one determines the
threshold of \"tolerable injustice\" amounts to the most radical
question of the book. What would be put into question is the very social
order itself and not merely its unjust practices. As citizens, is it
even possible for the ghetto poor to speak and give reasons for the
necessity of revolutionizing the basic structure when the rejoinder
could always be: \"[The very condition of possibility for your
evaluative speech is the very structure you wish to uproot. Either your
speech is a contradiction or what you really mean is
reform.\"]{.underline} [It would appear the circle of equivocation
threatens to foreclose radical critique, but Shelby responds, \"However,
if the society is stabilized by a deeply flawed conception of justice,
such as one that serves the narrow interests of corporate elites,
politicians, and affluent citizens, then more drastic or unconventional
measures may be warranted\"]{.underline} (224-225; emphasis mine). Note
the \"conception of justice\" is not a question of the nonideal
application of principles but the ideal of justice as reciprocity from
which these applications draw their legitimizing force. If the ideal is
corrupted, then what hope do we have of properly evaluating the
thresholds of injustice? In ideal theory over time a system of social
cooperation will become progressively more just (20), but what does this
mean if our evaluative schema is itself flawed? [Furthermore, it is
possible, Shelby admits, that dominant ideology can distort what it is
that justice (reciprocity) demands and thus \"Moral suasion and
electoral politics may simply not be enough. Black radicals and
left-wing feminists . . . have taken exactly this position with respect
to the United States, regarding this society as a deeply racist,
patriarchal, and plutocratic order]{.underline}\" (225). Moral suasion
and electoral politics are, in the given order of things, the two routes
to reform, but if the basic structure reveals that it will not respond
to these strategies substantively then what is to be done? Shelby will
say that the ghetto poor are not bound---as citizens---to respect the
law of an unjust social order. But in making this radical and, for sure,
controversial argument he eventually gives with one hand what he must
take back with the other: [Some aspects of the basic structure (its
educational, law enforcement, and economic institutions, for instance)
may be regulated by \[End Page 106\] a corrupt ideology, while other
parts (say, its constitution or basic political organization) may be
just or diverge moderately from reasonable and widely recognizable
standards of justice. Indeed, contrary to the view of some on the
political left, this mixed assessment is, I suspect, the one most
applicable to post-civil-rights America, as the Civil Rights movement
did help to make blacks\' constitutional rights considerably more
meaningful.]{.underline} (225; emphasis mine) The problem lies not in
the fact of Shelby\'s \"mixed-assessment,\" per se, but in the question
of how he is justified in making this evaluative assessment in the first
place. [With the insertion of \"the Civil Rights movement\" into his
argument Shelby introduces the question of historical time and reform.
Reform is possible because the basic structure from which we draw our
evaluative scheme is just or only diverges moderately from
justice.]{.underline} Shelby explicitly states that he does not intend
to give a \"comprehensive account of the principles a society must
satisfy to be fully just\" (11). But he leaves open the question of the
source of the standard that is to be deployed to measure what justice
calls for. Without an answer to that question one must ask whether the
claim of \"mixed-assessment\" is fully supported. [Whether revolution is
necessary in U.S. civil society appears to be a claim that could never
be reasonably made in political speech. When the weight of our
ideological political history for the Black underclass has always been
to tell them \"Reform, reform, reform. Wait, wait, wait. Your justice
will be in the future]{.underline} (always in the future)\" Shelby\'s
racial valuing complicates ideal and nonideal theory\'s relationship to
time insofar as neither can tell us when justice deferred becomes
justice denied. One need only listen to how the Civil Rights movement
and MLK, in particular, have become the ideological representation of
how well the long-suffering Black population can and ought to wait for
justice rather than the active resistant movement it truly was. Neither
ideal or nonideal theory informs us of when their schemas of evaluation
no longer apprehend its professed value[. Even as Shelby fastidiously
stays within the liberal-egalitarian framework his work of racial
valuing threatens to exceed it and thus new responses become
articulable.]{.underline} Even if that response is only the recognition
of the double-bind between reform and revolution under which the most
vulnerable of us have historically and presently struggled.

7\. Liberalism Is Naïve in Assuming the Neutrality of the State and the
Juridical System Mainstream liberalism tends to assume the
juridico-political neutrality of the liberal-democratic state, but [such
naivety need not be true of all varieties of liberalism]{.underline}.
(Note that nowhere in Gray's characterization is any such assumption
made.) The [neutrality of the juridico-political system is really a
liberal ideal, a norm to be striven for to reflect citizens' equal moral
status before the law and entitlement to equal protection of their
legitimate interests]{.underline}. [To represent it as a sociological
generalization]{.underline} of liberal theory about actual political
systems, including systems self-designated as liberal, [would be to
confuse the normative with the descriptive]{.underline}. [Liberalism
has]{.underline} certainly [**historically had no trouble in
seeing**]{.underline} the **[illicit influence of concentrated group
power in the sociopolitical systems it opposed]{.underline}** (see
section #2). The original critique of "feudal" absolutism, the
twentieth-century critique of "totalitarianism," relied in part on the
documentation and condemnation of the extent of legally-backed state
repression in curbing individual freedom. [Liberalism's blind spot has
been its failure to document and condemn]{.underline} the [enormity of
the historic denial of equal rights to the majority of the population
ruled by self-styled "liberal" states:]{.underline} the "[absolutism"
and "totalitarianism" directed against white women and white workers,
and the nonwhite enslaved and colonized. **Patriarchal democracy,
bourgeois democracy, Herrenvolk democracy have all been represented as
"democracy" simpliciter, with no analysis of the mechanisms of
structural subordination that have characterized such polities,**
o]{.underline}r the ideological sleights-of-hand that have rationalized
them. [But to]{.underline} claim a necessary conceptual connection
between such evasions and liberal assumptions [is to
confuse]{.underline} the [contingent necessities o]{.underline}f the
discourse of [hegemonic liberalism]{.underline}---[aimed at
preserving,]{.underline} whether by justifying or obfuscating,
[patriarchal, bourgeois, and racial power]{.underline}---with what is
taken to be some kind of transworld essence of liberalism. In recent
decades, a large body of literature has developed that investigates the
impact of class, race, and gender dynamics in the actual functioning of
the state and the legal system.23 **[Radical liberalism would draw on
this body of literature in seeking to put in place the safeguards
necessary for guaranteeing equal protection not merely on paper but in
reality]{.underline}**

10\. American Liberalism in Particular Has Been so Shaped in Its
Development by Race that Any Emancipatory Possibilities Have Been
Foreclosed Liberalism in general (both nationally and internationally)
has been shaped by race, but that does not preclude reclaiming it.29
Moreover, [it is precisely]{.underline} such [shaping that
motivates]{.underline} the imperative of [recognizing the multiplicity
of liberalisms]{.underline}, not merely for cataloging purposes but in
order to frame them as theoretical objects whose dynamic requires
investigation. [The conflation of all liberalisms with their racialized
versions obstructs]{.underline} seeing these [ideologies as historically
contingent varieties of liberalism,]{.underline} which could have
developed otherwise. [A]{.underline} Brechtian "defamiliarization" is
necessary, a [cognitive distancing that "denaturalizes"
what]{.underline} is prone to [appear as the essence of
liberalism]{.underline}. Jennifer Pitts's A Turn to Empire, for example,
which is subtitled [The Rise of Imperial Liberalism in Britain and
France, and Sankar Muthu's Enlightenment against Empire,
both]{.underline} seek to [demarcate]{.underline} within liberalism [the
existence of **anti- as well as pro-imperialist strains**]{.underline},
thereby demonstrating that liberalism is not a monolith.30 Admittedly,
other scholars have been more ambivalent about some of their supposed
exemplars; see, for example, Losurdo, already cited, and John Hobson's
recent The Eurocentric Conception of World Politics, which develops a
detailed and sophisticated taxonomy of varieties of Eurocentrism and
imperialism that demonstrates the compatibility of racism, Eurocentrism,
and anti-imperialism.31 (For instance, many European liberal theorists
were anti-imperialist precisely because of their racism---their fears
that the white race would degenerate as a result of miscegenation with
inferior races and the deleterious consequences of prolonged residence
in the unsuitable tropical climates of colonial outposts.) But [the mere
fact of such a range of positions illustrates that a
liberalism]{.underline} neither Eurocentric nor imperialist [is not a
contradiction]{.underline} in terms. In the United States in particular,
as Rogers Smith has demonstrated, [liberalism and racism have been
intricately involved with one another from the nation's
inception]{.underline}, a relationship Smith conceptualizes in terms of
conflicting "multiple traditions," racism versus liberal universalism,
and which [I see as a conflict between "racial liberalism" and
non-racial liberalism]{.underline}.32 My belief is that **[formally
identifying "racial liberalism" as a particular evolutionary (and always
evolving) ideological phenomenon better enables us to understand the
role of race in writing and rewriting the most important political
philosophy in the nation's history,]{.underline}** from the overtly
racist liberalism of the past to the nominally color-blind liberalism of
the present. From the eighteenth-century/nineteenth-century
accommodation to racial slavery and aboriginal expropriation to the
twentieth-century tainting of welfare and social democracy on this side
of the Atlantic,33 race has refracted crucial terms, concepts, and
values in liberal theory so as to remove any cognitive dissonance
between the privileging of whites and the subordination of people of
color. Correspondingly, the shaping of white moral psychology by race,
and the distinctive patterns of uptake of abstract liberal values
("equality," "individualism") in such a psychology, then become
legitimate objects of investigation for us.34 In this revisionist
framework, one begins from the assumption that crucial norms will be
color-coded in their actual operationalization, so that any efficacious
framing of an interracial political project will need to anticipate and
correct for this differential understanding, rather than being naively
surprised by it. But [such racialization (as popular interpretation and
reception) is going to be a common problem for any American ideology
with emancipatory pretensions. Liberalism is certainly not unique in
that respect, as the history of the white American left and socialist
movements illustrates.]{.underline} As Jack London famously put it at a
meeting of the Socialist Party in San Francisco "when challenged by
various members concerning his emphasis on the yellow peril": "What the
devil! I am first of all a white man and only then a Socialist!"35
Herrenvolk socialism existed no less than Herrenvolk liberalism.

### Reform Good - AT Doesn't Recognize Macro Ontologies

2\. Liberalism Cannot Recognize Groups and Group Oppression in Its
Ontology---I (Macro) [The second point needs to be logically
distinguished from the first, since a theory could acknowledge the
social shaping of individuals while denying that group oppression is
central to that shaping]{.underline}. (So #1 is necessary, but not
sufficient, for #2.) The Marxist critique, of course, was supposed to
encapsulate both points: people were shaped by society and society
(post-- "primitive communism") was class-dominated. The ontology was
social and it was an ontology of [class. Today radicals would demand a
richer ontology that can accommodate the realities of gender and racial
oppression also.]{.underline} But [whatever candidates are put
forward]{.underline}, **[the key claim is that a liberal framework
cannot accommodate an ontology of groups in relations of domination and
subordination.]{.underline}** To the extent that liberalism recognizes
social groups, these are basically conceived of as voluntary
associations that one chooses to join or not join, which is obviously
very different from, say, class, race, and gender memberships. But [this
evasive ontology, which obfuscates the most central and obvious fact
about all societies since humanity exited the hunting-and-gathering
stage---viz., that they are characterized by oppressions of one kind or
another---**is not a definitional constituent of
liberalism**.]{.underline} Liberalism has certainly recognized some
kinds of oppression: the absolutism it opposed in the seventeenth to
nineteenth centuries, the Nazism and Stalinism it opposed in the
twentieth century. [Liberalism's failure to systematically address
structural oppression in supposedly liberal-democratic societies **is a
contingent artifact of the group perspectives** and **group interests
privileged by those structures**, **not an intrinsic feature** of
liberalism's conceptual apparatus]{.underline}. In the preface to her
recent Analyzing Oppression, Ann Cudd makes a striking point: that hers
is the first book-length treatment of the subject in the analytic
tradition.7 [Philosophy]{.underline}, the discipline whose special
mandate it is to illuminate justice and injustice for us[, has had very
little to say about injustice and oppression because of the social
background of the majority of its thinkers]{.underline}. In political
theory and political philosophy, the [theorists who
developed]{.underline} the [dominant varieties of liberalism have come
overwhelmingly from]{.underline} the [hegemonic groups of the liberal
social order]{.underline} (bourgeois white males). [So it
is]{.underline} really [not surprising that]{.underline}, given this
background[, their sociopolitical and epistemic standpoint has tended to
reproduce]{.underline} rather than challenge [group
privilege]{.underline}. Consider Rawls, famously weak on gender and with
next to nothing to say about race. Rawlsian "ideal theory," which has
dominated mainstream political philosophy for the last four decades,
marginalizes such concerns not contingently but structurally. [If your
focus from the start is principles of distributive justice for a
"well-ordered society," then social oppression cannot be part of the
picture, since by definition an oppressive society is not a well-ordered
one]{.underline}. As Cudd points out, A Theory of Justice "leaves
injustice virtually untheorized," operating on the assumption "that
injustice is merely the negation of justice."8 But radically unjust
societies---those characterized by major rather than minor deviations
from ideality---will be different from just societies not merely morally
but metaphysically. [What Cudd calls "nonvoluntary social groups" will
be central to their makeup, so that a conceptualization of such groups
must be central to any adequate account of social oppression: "without
positing social groups as causally efficacious entities, we cannot
explain oppression."]{.underline} Contra the conventional wisdom in
radical circles, however, she is insistent that the [ontology of such
groups can be explained "\[using\] current social science, in the form
of cognitive psychology and modern economic theory,]{.underline} and
situat\[ing\] itself in the Anglo-American tradition of liberal
political philosophy."9 Identifying "intentionalist" and "structuralist"
approaches as the two broad categories of competing theorizations of
social groups, she recommends as the best option a compatibilist
position, holding that [while all action is intentionally guided,
many]{.underline} of the [constraints]{.underline} within which we act
[are socially determined and beyond]{.underline} the [control of the
currently acting individual;]{.underline} to put a slogan on it,
intentions dynamically interact within social structures. . . . My
theory of nonvoluntary social groups fits the description of what Philip
Pettit calls "holistic individualism," which means that the [social
regularities associated with nonvoluntary social groups supervene on
intentional states, and at the same time, group membership in these and
voluntary social groups partly constitutes the intentional states of
individuals]{.underline}.10 If Cudd is right, then, [such a theorization
can indeed be developed within a liberal framework, using the resources
of analytic social and normative theory.]{.underline} But such a
development of the theory is not merely permissible, but should be seen
as mandatory, given liberalism's nominal commitment to individualism,
egalitarianism, universalism, and meliorism. [These values simply cannot
be achieved unless]{.underline} the [obstacles to their realization are
identified and theorized]{.underline}. Social-democratic
([left]{.underline}) liberalism, feminist liberalism, black liberalism,
all historically represent attempts to take these structural realities
into account for the purposes of rethinking dominant liberalism.11 They
are attempts to get right, to map accurately, the actual ontology of the
societies for which liberalism is prescribing principles of justice.
What Cudd's book demonstrates is that it is [the ignoring of this
ontology of group domination that is the real betrayal of the liberal
project. A well-ordered society will not have nonvoluntary social groups
as part of its ontology]{.underline}. So the path to the "realistic
utopia" Rawls is supposedly outlining would crucially require normative
prescriptions for eliminating such groups. That no such guidelines are
offered is undeniably an indictment of ideal-theory liberalism, which is
thereby exposed as both epistemologically and ontologically inadequate.
But that does not rule out a reconceptualized liberalism, a
nonideal-theory liberalism that, starting from a different social
metaphysic, requires a different normative strategy for theorizing
justice.

### Reform Good - AT Doesn't Recognize Micro Ontologies

But (it will be replied) liberalism suffers from a deeper theoretical
inadequacy. Even if it may be conceded that liberal theory can recognize
oppression at the macro-level[, it will be argued that its individualism
prevents]{.underline} it [from recognizing]{.underline} how profoundly,
[at the micro-level, individuals]{.underline} are [shaped by structures
of social oppression]{.underline}. [**Class, race, and gender belongings
penetrate deeply into the ontology of the individual** in ways rendered
opaque (it will be claimed) by liberalism's foundational
individualism]{.underline}. But what those seeking to retrieve
liberalism would point out is that [we need to distinguish
different]{.underline} **[senses of "individualism."]{.underline}** The
[individualism]{.underline} that is [foundational to liberalism
is]{.underline} a [normative individualism]{.underline} (as in the Gray
quote above), [which makes individuals rather than social collectivities
the locus of value]{.underline}. But [that does not require]{.underline}
any [denial that individuals are shaped in their character]{.underline}
(the "second nature" famously highlighted by left theory) **[by
oppressive social forces and related group memberships.]{.underline}**
Once the first two criticisms have been refuted---that liberal
individuals cannot be "social," and that the involuntary group
memberships central to the social in oppressive societies cannot be
accommodated within a liberal framework---then this third criticism
collapses with them also. [One can without inconsistency affirm both the
value of the individual and the importance of recognizing how the
individual is socially molded, especially when the environing social
structures are oppressive ones]{.underline}. As already noted[, dominant
liberalism tends to ignore or marginalize such constraints]{.underline},
assuming as its representative figures individuals not merely morally
equal, but socially recognized as morally equal, and equi-powerful
rather than groupdifferentiated into the privileged and the
subordinated**[. But this misleading normative and descriptive picture
is a function of a political agenda complicit with the status quo, not a
necessary implication of liberalism's core assumptions.]{.underline}** A
revisionist, radical liberalism would make the analysis of group
oppression, the denial of equal standing to the majority of the
population, and their impact on the individual's ontology, a theoretical
priority. Thus Cudd's book, after explicating the ontology of
involuntary groups, goes on to detail the various different ways,
through violence, economic constraint, discrimination, group harassment,
and the internalization of psychological oppression, that the
subordinated are shaped by group domination.12 But nothing in her
account is meant to imply either that they thereby cease to be
individuals, or that their involuntary group memberships preclude a
normative liberal condemnation of the injustice of their treatment.

A different kind of challenge is mounted by Foucault (though arguably
originating in such earlier sources as the "anti-humanism" of
Althusserian Marxism).13 Here, as John Christman points out, in contrast
to the "thick" conception of the person advocated by communitarianism,
in critique of liberalism, we get the theoretical recommendation that
"the notion of a singular unified subject of any sort, however thin the
conception, \[must be\] abandoned."14 As Foucault writes: How, under
what conditions, and in what forms can something like a subject appear
in the order of discourse? What place can it occupy in each type of
discourse, what functions can it assume, and by obeying what rules? In
short, [it is a matter of depriving the subject]{.underline} (or its
substitute) **[of its role as originator, and of analyzing the subject
as a variable and complex function of discourse]{.underline}**.15 **[The
subject is not merely molded by power, but produced by power, and, in
effect, vanishes]{.underline}**. I agree that [liberalism cannot meet
such a challenge]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} I think **[the premise
of the challenge should be rejected.]{.underline}** Here I am in
sympathy with Christman, who, reviewing various critiques of the classic
liberal humanist conception of the self, argues for a socio-historical
conception that concedes the absurdity of the notion of people springing
from their own brow ("originators") while nonetheless making a case for
"degrees" of self-creation: \[S\]elves should be seen as to a large
extent formed by factors not under the control of those reflective
agents themselves. . . . This will help accomplish two things: to
provide grounds for the rejection of models of agency and citizenship
that assume Herculean abilities to fashion ourselves out of whole cloth;
and to force us to focus more carefully on what powers of self-shaping
we therefore are left with. . . . The point must be that the role of the
self's control of the self (and the attendant social elements of both
'selves') will be circumscribed by the ways in which our lives are
shaped for us and not by us.16 [A commitment to humanism does
not,]{.underline} as pointed out above, **[require the denial of the
obvious fact that human beings---especially the oppressed--- are
constrained in what they can accomplish by material structures and
social restrictions]{.underline}**, nor that, as products of particular
epochs and group memberships, their consciousness will have been shaped
by dominant concepts and norms. Marx emphasized long ago that [though
people make history, they do not make it under conditions of their own
choosing,]{.underline} that agency is constrained by structure and
circumstance. But, contra Althusser, this was never intended as a
rejection of the claim that it is still people who ultimately assert
their personhood in struggle. And in my opinion, the retort applies to
the Foucauldian version of the thesis also. [To make the familiar left
critiques: such an analysis not only deprives us of a normative basis
for indicting structures of oppression, not only deprives the subject of
agency, but **is flagrantly inconsistent with the actual history of
people's resistance to the systems that have supposedly "produced" them
as subjects**]{.underline}. **[The anti-colonial struggle, the
anti-Fascist and anti-Stalinist struggles, the civil rights struggles of
white women, people of color, gays, the recent and ongoing "Arab
spring," all give the lie to such a diagnosis]{.underline}**. [Radical
liberalism is capable of recognizing both the extent of our
socialization by the existing oppressive social order and the ways in
which, nonetheless, many people resist and struggle against this
oppressive social order.]{.underline}

### Reform Good - AT Liberalism = Anti-Socialist

"Socialism" is used in different senses. Assuming that a romanticized
return to pre-industrial communal systems is not on the cards for a
globalized world of 7 billion people, there are three main alternatives
so far (two tried, one theorized about): state-commandist socialism,
social democracy, market socialism. [State-commandist socialism, aka
"communism," is indeed incompatible with liberalism, but would seem to
have been refuted as an attractive ideal by the history of the twentieth
century.24 Social democracy is just left-liberalism, whether in Rawls's
version or in versions further left, like Brian Barry's, more worried
about the inequalities Rawls's two principles of justice leave
intact.]{.underline}25 **[Market socialism is yet to be implemented on a
national level, but many of the hypothetical accounts of how it would
work emphasize the importance of respecting liberal
norms]{.underline}**.26 In other words, [market socialism's]{.underline}
putative [superiority]{.underline} to capitalism [is not defended by
invoking distinctively socialist values,]{.underline} but by showing how
such uncontroversial and [traditional liberal values as democracy,
freedom, and self-realization]{.underline} are not going to be
achievable for the majority under the present system. (Or through the
appeal to more recent values like sustainability, generated by awareness
of the impending ecological disaster, which the present order will make
achievable for nobody!) Other possibilities are not ruled out, but
**[their proponents would have to explain how their models have learned
the lessons of the past in both (a) being economically viable (b)
respecting human rights, the common global moral currency of the postwar
epoch, which is best developed in the liberal tradition]{.underline}**.
**[Criticism of the existing order is not enough; one has to show how
one's proposed "socialist" alternative will be superior (and in more
than a vague hand-waving kind of way).]{.underline}**

6\. Liberalism's Enlightenment Origins Commit It to Seeing Moral Suasion
and Rational Discourse as the Societal Prime Movers [Liberalism is often
associated with a historical progressivism, but a belief in]{.underline}
the [possibility]{.underline} and desirability [of
meliorism]{.underline} (see Gray) [certainly does not commit one to
Whiggish teleologies.]{.underline} One can oppose conservative fatalism
and pessimism in its different versions---Christian claims about
original sin, Burkean distrust of abstract reason, biological
determinism in its everchanging and ever-renewed incarnations---without
thinking that there is any inevitability about the triumph of progress
and reason. [A liberalism that is "radical" will necessarily **need to
draw on the left tradition's demystified analysis of the centrality of
group domination to the workings of the social order**]{.underline}.22
As earlier noted (sections #2 and 3 above), [a revisionist ontology that
recognizes as key social players nonvoluntary social groups in
structural relations of domination]{.underline} and subordination [will
perforce have a more realistic view of the (in)efficacy of moral suasion
than an ontology of atomic individuals.]{.underline} Such [a revisionist
liberalism will acknowledge]{.underline} the [role of hegemonic
ideologies]{.underline} and vested group interests in the preservation
of the status quo, [and their refractoriness to appeals to reason and
justice]{.underline}. Indeed, it will often be precisely in the names of
a "reason" and "justice" shaped by the norms and perspectives of group
privilege---of class, gender, and race---that egalitarian social change
is resisted. As Losurdo makes clear, [no]{.underline} [immanent
developmentalist moral dynamic drives liberalism's
evolution]{.underline}. [It is not at all the case that an endorsement
of democratized liberal norms implies any corollary belief that the
democratic struggle for a more egalitarian social order is guaranteed to
be successful. **Progress is possible; defeat and rollback are also
possible. In general, a radical liberalism should, in some sense, be
"materialist,"**]{.underline} recognizing the extent to which both
people and the social dynamic are shaped by material forces, and not
over-estimating the causal role of rational argumentation and moral
suasion on their own. [Radical liberalism takes for granted that
political and ideological struggle will be necessary to realize liberal
values against the opposition of those who all too frequently think of
themselves as the real liberals. Radical liberalism can be descriptively
realist (realizing the centrality of interest-based politics) without
being normatively realist (abandoning morality for
realpolitik).]{.underline}

### Reform Good - AT Social Contract Theory Bad

#### Social contract theory does not [apply to all forms]{.underline} of liberalism

1\. Liberalism Has an Asocial, Atomic Individualist Ontology [This is
one of the oldest radical critiques of liberalism;]{.underline} it can
be found in Marx's derisive comments, for example in the Grundrisse,
about the "Robinsonades" of the social contract theory whose "golden
age" (1650--1800) had long passed by the time he began his intellectual
and political career: The individual and isolated hunter or fisher who
forms the starting-point with Smith and Ricardo belongs to the insipid
illusions of the eighteenth century. They are Robinson Crusoe stories .
. . . no more based on such a naturalism than is Rousseau's contrat
social which makes naturally independent individuals come in contact and
have mutual intercourse by contract. . . . Man is in the most literal
sense of the word a zoon politikon, not only a social animal, but an
animal which can develop into an individual only in society. Production
by individuals outside society . . . is as great an absurdity as the
idea of the development of language without individuals living together
and talking to one another.3 But several replies can be made to this
indictment. To begin with, [even if the accusation is true of
contractarian liberalism, not all liberalisms are
contractarian.]{.underline} Utilitarian [liberalism rests on different
theoretical foundations, as does the late nineteenth-century British
liberalism of T. H. Green and his colleagues:]{.underline} a Hegelian,
social liberalism.4 Closer to home, of course, [we have John Dewey's
brand of liberalism]{.underline}. Moreover, even within the social
contract tradition, [resources exist for contesting the assumptions of
the Hobbesian/Lockean version of the contract]{.underline}. Rousseau's
Discourse on the Origins of Inequality (1755) (nowhere given proper
credit by Marx5 ) rethinks the "contract" to make it a contract entered
into after the formation of society, and thus the creation of socialized
human beings. [So the ontology presupposed is explicitly a social one.
In any case, the contemporary revival of contractarianism initiated by
John Rawls's 1971 A Theory of Justice makes the contract a thought
experiment, a "device of representation," rather than a literal or even
metaphorical anthropological account.]{.underline} The
communitarian/contractarian debates of the 1980s onwards recapitulated
much of the "asocial" critique of contractarian liberalism (though
usually without a radical edge). But as Rawls pointed out against
Michael Sandel, for example, [one needs to distinguish the figures in
the thought experiment from real human beings]{.underline}.6 **[And
radicals should be wary about accepting a communitarian ontology and
claims about the general good that deny or marginalize the dynamics of
group domination in actual societies represented as
"communities."]{.underline}** The great virtue of contractarian liberal
individualism is the conceptual room it provides for hegemonic norms to
be critically evaluated through the epistemic and moral distancing from
Sittlichkeit that the contract, as an intellectual device, provides.

### Reform Possible -- Tier 2

#### Reform of liberalism is possible and necessary- even liberalism isn't perfect now, it's fundamental philosophy of equality is still valuable

**Hooker**, Professor of Political Science at Brown, **18**

(Juliet, Perspectives on Politics, Volume 16, Issue 3 p. 767-768, DG)

In Black Rights/White Wrongs, Mills gives a rather pessimistic
assessment of the success of this project, observing that the effect of
The Racial Contract on "mainstream political philosophy in general and
social contract theory in particular" has been "close to zero" (p. 191).
While he does recognize the book's impact on other disciplines, Mills
suggests (I think correctly) that for this audience, the "contract
framework is quite dispensable. . . . It is not the case that most of
these academics---certainly not those outside philosophy---are
interested in the exercise of seeing how Rawlsian contract theory can be
revised and reconstructed" (p. 192). This is the dilemma driving his
current book: [Mills's oeuvre has been embraced by many as a powerful
critique of liberalism and contractarianism, while he views his work as
a call for the rearticulation of these traditions in more radical and
truly egalitarian forms. Mills, it could be argued, rejects Audre
Lorde's famous dictum that "the master's tools will never dismantle the
master's house]{.underline} (Sister Outsider, 1984, p. 112)." Contra
Lorde, [Mills seeks to recuperate contractarian liberalism from its
racial origins and reframe it conceptually to place questions of racial
justice at its center. "Occupying" liberalism is worthwhile, he argues,
for both substantive and strategic reasons: Liberalism's ideal of moral
equality is normatively attractive even if it has never been fully
implemented in practice, and as the dominant political ideology in the
world today, a conception of racial justice rooted in it has a greater
likelihood of being adopted]{.underline} (p. 178). He offers "black
radical liberalism" as an example of a "self-consciously anti-racist
liberalism" that "(a) recognizes white supremacy as central to the
making of the United States and (more sweepingly) the modern world, and
(b) seeks to rethink the categories, crucial assumptions, and
descriptive and normative frameworks of liberalism in the light of that
recognition" (p. 203). Drawing on Immanuel Kant, Karl Marx, and W. E. B.
Du Bois, his "black radical liberalism" aims to synthesize "the most
valuable insights of the black nationalist and black Marxist traditions
and incorporates them into a dramatically transformed liberalism" (p.
191). With the exception of the brief epilogue, however, Black
Rights/White Wrongs does not actually sketch "black radical liberalism,"
which, Mills tell us, is a project for a future book. [Instead, his aim
in this book is to show why that project is necessary. He demonstrates
in rigorous detail how all extant variants of liberalism,]{.underline}
and in particular the Rawlsian variant, have in fact been racially
exclusionary, contrary to their selfunderstanding. [This has led them
all to consistently evade one of the pressing political problems of the
modern era: how to redress racial injustices that were central to the
actual historical emergence of modern liberal political orders, such as
indigenous genocide and expropriation, the transatlantic slave trade,
and Third World colonization.]{.underline} Mills is a philosopher, and
this book is a collection of previously published essays, most of which
appeared in nonpolitical science outlets, that work well as a coherent
entity. All of the chapters are persuasive and rigorously argued, and
peppered with the author's distinctive humor. Chapter 2, "Occupy
Liberalism!" is his manifesto, while Chapter 3 on racial liberalism
cogently and succinctly lays out more than 200 years of modern
Euro-American political thought, showing how liberalism has consistently
had a racial, gendered, and imperial character despite its stated
commitment to the moral equality of all persons. Three chapters are all
concerned, in various ways, with the place of race in Rawls's oeuvre and
the applicability of his work to questions of racial justice: Chapter 5
on ideal theory, Chapter 8 on Rawls's silence on race, and Chapter 9 on
Tommie Shelby's reformulation of Rawlsian principles of justice. The two
chapters that will probably be of most interest to political theorists
and political scientists make an important contribution to our
understanding of racism: Chapter 4 on white ignorance (a revised version
of a previously published essay on race and epistemology) and Chapter 7,
which sketches an account of the concept of racial exploitation. Also
noteworthy is Chapter 6 on how to reconcile Kant's writings on race with
his much more well known work on ethics and cosmopolitanism, which
exemplifies how political theorists and philosophers can meet Mills's
challenge to cease whitewashing the Western canon by grappling directly
with the racist aspects of the work of central figures in the tradition,
rather than setting them aside as marginal. Indeed, Mills's unflinching
candor about the whiteness of philosophy raises uncomfortable questions
for political theorists and political scientists about where (and by
whom) race is studied in the field, and whether this work is viewed as
central or marginal to the discipline's core concerns. Political
theorists and political scientists working on race will find most of
Mills's arguments in this book compelling. [Yet even if it is the case
that liberalism is now the only game in town, as the author argues,
important questions remain.]{.underline} I briefly point to two of them
here. The first has to do with how to overcome the blindnesses and
evasions in liberal theory that he has systematically critiqued. If one
assumes, as Mills does, that these evasions are not conceptually
constitutive, one way to overcome them is by supplementing canonical
sources with other traditions that have directly confronted the real
history of the modern world. [As he points out, liberalism's various
founding fictions, such as"the state of nature as empty of aboriginal
peoples, society as nonexploitatively and consensually and cooperatively
founded \... are unavoidably an abstraction from the European and
EuroAmerican experience of modernity]{.underline}. . . . It is in effect
. . . a conceptualization ultimately grounded in and apposite for the
experience of white settlerdom" (pp. 38--39). Lorde's claim about the
master's tools can thus be taken as a call to engage with subaltern
thinkers and traditions in order to develop "a new tool kit" that would
take "the experience of expropriated reds, enslaved blacks, annexed
browns, and excluded yellows" as its starting point (p. 115), which is
what Mills hopes that liberal theory will do.

#### **Anti-colonial movements are liberal in nature and liberalism can be purified in a post-colonial context**

**Claudio, Associate Professor at the Department of History, De La Salle
University, 17** -- (Lisandro E., \"Defending Liberalism in the Global
South: Notes from Duterte\'s Philippines,\" The Global South, vol. 11
no. 2, 2017, pp. 92-107, Project MUSE, muse.jhu.edu/article/696279)
/ncp-AW

[The second claim is that liberalism is]{.underline} a modernist credo
external to the experiences of the Global South and postcolonies and
thus [out of sync with the necessities of today.]{.underline} We have
already noted how de Sousa Santos views the \"indifference\" of
liberalism as anathema to the radical needs of the South. And we have
also examined how the Comaroffs view liberalism as a \"parochial\"
remnant of Euro-American modernity inapplicable to the Global South,
both because it comes from Europe and America, and because it is
anchored on outdated beliefs about the rule of law. Elsewhere, the
Comaroffs contend that the liberal belief in \"the capacity for
constitutionalism and contract, rights and legal \[End Page 96\]
remedies to accomplish order, civility, justice, empowerment\" is a form
of legal \"fetishism\" that is ultimately \"chimerical,\" especially in
postcolonial contexts. This kind of politics, then, becomes nothing but
a pyramid scheme: \"The more it is indulged, the more it is required\"
(2001, 38). Again I offer two replies. **[First, a history of liberalism
shows that its potency as a political credo is not limited to the
West.]{.underline}** [Of course, we cannot deny that much of
liberalism\'s early history lies in Europe and that the US became a
major hub of liberal experimentation]{.underline}; liberalism\'s place
in what the Comaroffs label the \"Euro-American\" past is not up for
debate. But because liberalism may encompass shifting subjectivities,
political actors have been able to redefine liberalism within colonial
contexts. [Mehta is correct that imperialists deployed liberal rhetoric
to justify expansionist policy]{.underline}. **[Nevertheless, the
earliest anti-colonial movements were likewise liberal in nature, and, I
would argue, more in line with the tenets of classical
liberalism]{.underline}**. [Anti-colonial radicals in Spanish
America]{.underline}, as Richard J. Evans notes, [corresponded and
collaborated with European liberals]{.underline}, forming a liberal and
radical \"international whose connections spanned the Atlantic\" (2016,
17). Spain was a crucial node in this liberal internationalism; its
various patriotic societies, which emerged after the Napoleonic wars,
inspired similar organizations throughout the continent (Evans 2016,
39). It is thus unsurprising that European liberalism spread to Asia
through the Spanish colony of the Philippines. Historians John
Schumacher (1991, 31) and Nick Joaquin (2005, 24--35) have posited that
the propaganda movement that paved the way for [the Philippine
revolution]{.underline} of 1896 (the first anti-colonial revolution in
Asia) [was birthed within a local liberal tradition that mixed with
nationalist anti-colonialism]{.underline}. Recent evidence has shown,
moreover, that, like the French revolution, **[the Philippine revolution
was also liberal in character]{.underline}**.3 [Critics]{.underline}
view liberalism through the eyes of \"liberal\" imperialists, but they
[are silent about how colonized actors themselves articulated concepts
of liberty and human rights from their subaltern positions]{.underline}.
Philippine national hero, the polymath novelist and polemicist Jose
[Rizal, saw in the liberal tenets of the French declaration of rights a
blueprint for a society after colonialism]{.underline}, translating the
declaration for his countrymen during a sojourn in Hong Kong (Schumacher
1997, 270). **[He]{.underline}** was a liberal who criticized
colonialism on liberal grounds and **[believed that liberals who abetted
colonial rule were untrue to their principles.]{.underline}** Writing in
1890, Rizal claimed that if Spanish liberals in the Philippines had
\"more faith in their ideals,\" they would resist the colonial rule of
Catholic friars and that \"modern ideas\" would not \"be asphyxiated
upon touching the shores of Manila\" (1964, 289). If it is true that the
one consistent feature of liberalism\'s history has been the \"constant
opposition to assorted tyrannies,\" then [the more authentic liberals
were those in colonial contexts, who argued that colonialism was
tyranny]{.underline} \[End Page 97\] [writ large]{.underline} (Ryan
2012, 28). For the Filipino propagandists, **[there was a sense that
liberalism could be purified in colonial contexts.]{.underline}**4
[\"Liberals\" in positions of power more easily succumb to tyranny,
thereby turning their backs on their very own principles. A correction
of liberalism could thus occur in places of disempowerment]{.underline}.
What prevents Global South thinkers from appropriating this liberal
anti-colonialism today? This appropriation would not be a wholesale
adoption of modernity and Enlightenment. Rather, as in the case of
Filipino propagandists, it would begin by grappling with rights and
liberties in the post-colony, seeing how these can be enhanced and
purified in these new contexts.

### Reform Possible - McKee

#### Even if liberalism is imperfect it\'s still possible to retrieve liberalism from white domination- different philosophical framings of difference can create conciliation

**McKee**, Bachelor of Education, University of Victoria, **12**

(James Colton, "The Radical Liberal Interculturalism Triad: Toward
Retrieving Liberalism From White Domination,"
<https://dspace.library.uvic.ca/handle/1828/6678?show=full>, DG)

[Let me turn now to the theoretical transformation that I argue must
accompany the schedule of policy reforms that I will advocate for in the
forthcoming chapters.]{.underline} To say nothing of the theoretical
shifts needed if the polity is to become more pluralistic would render
this text impotent. With this in mind[, it is imperative to discuss
Canadian liberalism and Canadian political philosophy in general as
comporting with the standard Anglo-American narrative, which articulates
the view that the mere acknowledgment of morally equal and politically
neutral persons is foundational to modern political
theories.]{.underline} Having made the point, however, [it
is]{.underline} also [abundantly clear to anyone paying]{.underline}
closer [attention or to those Canadians who cannot pass for, appear as,
or identify with whiteness that this mainstream liberal narrative of
normative equalization is]{.underline} either illusory or quite simply
[false]{.underline}. That is to say, [Canadian history indicates that
since colonial times it has not been the case that non-whites were seen
as morally, legally or politically equal.]{.underline} The point I am
making is that [in order to diminish the cyclical consolidation of white
domination, Canada must move beyond and reject the purportedly neutral
apparatus of liberal multiculturalism, which]{.underline} in viewing the
polity as ideal and adopting an ideal normative starting point, employs
theoretical framings which [effectively wipe out a history of racial
oppression and asks non-whites to part with their grievances in the name
of liberal principles and in view of liberal progress.]{.underline} In
simple terms, notwithstanding one's position on the effectiveness of
multiculturalism in Canada, [it is hard to deny the fact that Canadian
multicultural reforms have always been thought of, legislated by, and
carried out by white parliamentarians, lawmakers and
bureaucrats.]{.underline} What is more, [multiculturalism has done
little]{.underline}, if anything substantive [to address past
injustices---especially in regards to First Peoples of Canada.
Unsurprisingly, the plausible deniability of white domination provided
by multicultural policy derives its purchase from the egalitarian
promises enshrined in the Canadian constitution,]{.underline} which
allows Canadian whites to resist and reject calls for addressing
injustice from a position of qualified credibility. Put another way, by
pointing to multiculturalism as a moral trump card, Canadian whites can
deny their privilege with relative comfort. By examining multicultural
policy the text will show that transformative changes are necessary for
Canadian pluralism to have any credibility in its claims[. Equally
important is the dire need for Canadian liberal discourse and theory to
shift.]{.underline} That is, [before tackling issues of dominance,
Canadians must come to terms with the reality that liberalism and its
associated offshoots like multiculturalism are foundationally tied to a
racially partitioned set of norms.]{.underline} Thus, [this thesis
argues that repositioning Canadian liberalism through the normative
starting point of non-ideal theory will move the polity closer to
achieving genuine pluralism.]{.underline} To clarify[: both ideal and
non-ideal theory involve the employment of moral ideals, and posit ways
of arriving at justice according to certain situations; the
juxtaposition then does not pit moral approaches against amoral
ones.]{.underline} 7 Instead, the [theoretical divergence lies in the
way in which liberal theory is normatively centred.]{.underline} That
is, whereas ideal theory envisages a perfectly just social cartography
and works from a normative core of liberal neutrality and assumed
symmetry, non-ideal theory conversely begins with a social cartography
which resembles the imperfect societies that are replete in the actual
world. At this point I now to turn to the work of John Rawls; perceived
by many as the central figure of the Anglo-American philosophical
tradition, Rawlsian liberal theory illustrates the socio-political and
normative assumptions that the ideal theory frameworks operate from and
which foreclose on and negate the possibility of redress for crimes of
colonialism. That is to say ideal theory catastrophically misconstrues
what ought to drive liberalism's normative priorities. [For Rawls, the
notion of society as "a cooperative venture for mutual advantage" is the
only tenable theoretical starting-point. What is more Rawlsian ideal
theory is not merely contingent on sanitizing the history of European
settler colonialism, but more importantly its foundational assumptions
rule out the very possibility of such a just world.]{.underline} [Framed
in this way, Mills writes "the problem does not inhere in exploration of
the ideal...the problem is the exploration of the ideal as an end in
itself without ever turning to the question of what is morally required
in the context of the radically deviant non-ideal
actuality"]{.underline} (p.118). Thus [by diverting attention from
actually existing injustice,]{.underline} ideal theory [codifies
dominance by maintaining the status quo.]{.underline} Evidently Rawls
prioritised ideal theory for what he deemed sound reasons: "the reason
for beginning with ideal theory is that it provides, I believe, the only
basis for the systematic grasp of these more pressing problems that we
are faced with in everyday life." (Rawls, 1999, p.8) 8 Non-ideal theory
then identifies particular socio-political problems in non-ideal
circumstances and then develops strategies on how best to adjudicate
rectificatory justice RJ. Roberts (2002) elucidates what is meant by RJ
in the following claim: rectificatory justice is that form of justice
employed as a means of addressing those situations that arise when the
requirements of a just system of distributive justice have broken down.
(p. 58-59) RJ then concerns a polity's commitment to acknowledging
wrongs and attempting to cultivate trust by setting them right. RJ is
not necessarily contingent on a redistribution of resources. Despite a
wide array of arguments in the literature to the contrary, RJ does not
require reparations. [What RJ requires is an acknowledgement on the part
of a perpetrator of injustice that a breach of justice has been
committed and resulted in an injury to an individual or
group.]{.underline} RJ is a principled approach that holds the core
values of: redress, reconciliation, and acknowledgement and does not
necessitate reparations. How then does non-ideal theory align with RJ?
In contrast to ideal theory, which aims at mapping a perfectly just
society, non-ideal theory recognizes the actual non-ideal state of
affairs and devises ways to adjudicate what measures of RJ ought to be
implanted in societies that are unjust. In the end, Rawls's focus is
almost exclusively on the former aim. [In what follows I expose
multiculturalism's inadequate policy agenda and propose a tripartite
prescription that includes an enhanced model of interculturalism as a
viable alternative.]{.underline} Moreover, interculturalism's focus is
on the integration of all persons into a socio-political collectivity;
instead of clinging to the maintenance of diversity as a central aim,
interculturalism emphasizes the processes and interactions, which
connect and identify individuals and groups in relation to each other.
[Simply put, interculturalism is a 9 pragmatic program; it promotes a
pluralistic polity but avoids the hegemonic tendencies of
assimilationist republican models-- examples include the American
melting pot or France's policy of strict republicanism---and the
centrifugal conventions of Canadian multiculturalism.]{.underline} For
Waddington et al. (2012) interculturalism contrasts with
multiculturalism insofar as it "considers the [acceptance of difference,
mutual respect, and cultural rapprochement to be conditions facilitating
convergence towards a common societal culture" which differs from
multiculturalism, which "promotes diversity as an inherent social
value."]{.underline} (p. 11) In addition, [this thesis makes additional
prescriptive recommendations with the intent of retrieving liberalism
from its fundamentally white dominated epistemology and ideological
discourses.]{.underline} In this way, I argue for theoretical and policy
commitments to the acknowledgement of the asymmetrical nature of
reciprocity in all social relations. What is more, [by re-imagining a
liberal normative core based on non-ideal theory's commitment to RJ this
thesis outlines a superior model for the liberal polity: the radically
liberal intercultural triad]{.underline}. Overall [the aim of this
thesis is twofold: (1) to expose liberal contractarianism's complicity
in both historical and contemporaneous white domination over non-whites;
and (2) to revive liberalism by offering a superior philosophical
framing of liberal values which applies to all persons and engenders
trust and conciliation across difference.]{.underline} In this way, this
thesis posits a socially normative project combining premises from
social contract theory, principles of liberalism and liberal pluralism
and provides a philosophical prescriptive for redressing social
injustice. Hence, I make a putatively radical case for a vastly
reorganized and reconceptualized form of liberalism. Drawing from Iris
Marion Young's conception of asymmetrical reciprocity I argue that [if
pluralism is to be achieved, the assumption of 10 equality and political
symmetry must be jettisoned.]{.underline} Similarly, the radical liberal
interculturalism triad draws from an intercultural model of interaction
and encourages dialogue between individuals and groups from vastly
different ethno-cultural, religious and linguistic backgrounds and
heritage, on the basis of mutual understanding and respect. Finally, the
rLIT seeks to explain the historical and contemporaneous omissions and
oversights that liberal contractarianism is too often guilty of by
steadfastly committing to RJ in policy, theory and national narratives.
Another task of this project is to elucidate a crucial gap in the
literature which reveals that measures of corrective or rectificatory
forms of justice are markedly absent from both proponents and opponents
of the current state of affairs. In response, [I argue that commitments
−both officially and attitudinally− to fundamental rectificatory
measures for past injustices are indispensable in rescuing liberalism
from white domination.]{.underline} So why then is this project
committed to reworking liberalism rather than doing something entirely
different? That is[, if liberalism and liberal contractarianism are
linked to racial exclusion, white dominance and oppression, does the
persistence of liberal contractarianism merely ensure the persistence of
oppression and obfuscation]{.underline}? As previously stated[,
liberalism is globally dominant; the intellectual inheritance and
hegemony of liberal contractarianism amongst policy-makers and political
theorists indicates that it will endure and thus I argue for a retrieval
of liberalism which takes a better account of the plurality of the
polity and extends its schedule of rights to all persons white and
non-white.]{.underline} Put another way, [although the liberal contract
tradition is imperfect, it can still do useful theoretical work if it is
appropriately amended to rectify 11 mainstream liberalism's failure to
recognize the existence of domination]{.underline}. As Mills (2012)
argues: the sources of \[liberal\] complicity (with domination) are, in
my opinion, primarily external rather than internal. [A progressive
liberalism can be retrieved once we recognize that its dominant
exclusionary incarnations have been shaped by the group interests and
group experiences of a particular class/gender/racially privileged
demographic subset rather than by any immanent conceptual and normative
logic of the ideology itself]{.underline} (p. 305- 323). Arguably
liberal norms and ideals are universally appealing in the abstract:
freedom, equality, individual rights, social justice are sound ideals;
however, this schedule of rights and the liberal normative core
generally has been circumscribed to exclusively benefit the dominant
group. [Yet despite liberalism's historical failures I argue the correct
response is not to jettison these sound liberal ideals but rather to
discard the illusory social ontology of white dominance that obfuscates
the socio-political forces that determine said ideals\' exclusionary
application. In short, retrieving liberalism vis-à-vis the rLIT provides
a superior social cartography and generates the philosophical space for
a liberalism that is inclusive.]{.underline}

#### Even if liberalism is imperfect it\'s still possible to retrieve liberalism from white domination- different philosophical framings of difference can create conciliation

[Let me turn now to the theoretical transformation that I argue must
accompany the schedule of policy reforms that I will advocate for in the
forthcoming chapters.]{.underline} To say nothing of the theoretical
shifts needed if the polity is to become more pluralistic would render
this text impotent. With this in mind[, it is imperative to discuss
Canadian liberalism and Canadian political philosophy in general as
comporting with the standard Anglo-American narrative, which articulates
the view that the mere acknowledgment of morally equal and politically
neutral persons is foundational to modern political
theories.]{.underline} Having made the point, however, [it
is]{.underline} also [abundantly clear to anyone paying]{.underline}
closer [attention or to those Canadians who cannot pass for, appear as,
or identify with whiteness that this mainstream liberal narrative of
normative equalization is]{.underline} either illusory or quite simply
[false]{.underline}. That is to say, [Canadian history indicates that
since colonial times it has not been the case that non-whites were seen
as morally, legally or politically equal.]{.underline} The point I am
making is that [in order to diminish the cyclical consolidation of white
domination, Canada must move beyond and reject the purportedly neutral
apparatus of liberal multiculturalism, which]{.underline} in viewing the
polity as ideal and adopting an ideal normative starting point, employs
theoretical framings which [effectively wipe out a history of racial
oppression and asks non-whites to part with their grievances in the name
of liberal principles and in view of liberal progress.]{.underline} In
simple terms, notwithstanding one's position on the effectiveness of
multiculturalism in Canada, [it is hard to deny the fact that Canadian
multicultural reforms have always been thought of, legislated by, and
carried out by white parliamentarians, lawmakers and
bureaucrats.]{.underline} What is more, [multiculturalism has done
little]{.underline}, if anything substantive [to address past
injustices---especially in regards to First Peoples of Canada.
Unsurprisingly, the plausible deniability of white domination provided
by multicultural policy derives its purchase from the egalitarian
promises enshrined in the Canadian constitution,]{.underline} which
allows Canadian whites to resist and reject calls for addressing
injustice from a position of qualified credibility. Put another way, by
pointing to multiculturalism as a moral trump card, Canadian whites can
deny their privilege with relative comfort. By examining multicultural
policy the text will show that transformative changes are necessary for
Canadian pluralism to have any credibility in its claims[. Equally
important is the dire need for Canadian liberal discourse and theory to
shift.]{.underline} That is, [before tackling issues of dominance,
Canadians must come to terms with the reality that liberalism and its
associated offshoots like multiculturalism are foundationally tied to a
racially partitioned set of norms.]{.underline} Thus, [this thesis
argues that repositioning Canadian liberalism through the normative
starting point of non-ideal theory will move the polity closer to
achieving genuine pluralism.]{.underline} To clarify[: both ideal and
non-ideal theory involve the employment of moral ideals, and posit ways
of arriving at justice according to certain situations; the
juxtaposition then does not pit moral approaches against amoral
ones.]{.underline} 7 Instead, the [theoretical divergence lies in the
way in which liberal theory is normatively centred.]{.underline} That
is, whereas ideal theory envisages a perfectly just social cartography
and works from a normative core of liberal neutrality and assumed
symmetry, non-ideal theory conversely begins with a social cartography
which resembles the imperfect societies that are replete in the actual
world. At this point I now to turn to the work of John Rawls; perceived
by many as the central figure of the Anglo-American philosophical
tradition, Rawlsian liberal theory illustrates the socio-political and
normative assumptions that the ideal theory frameworks operate from and
which foreclose on and negate the possibility of redress for crimes of
colonialism. That is to say ideal theory catastrophically misconstrues
what ought to drive liberalism's normative priorities. [For Rawls, the
notion of society as "a cooperative venture for mutual advantage" is the
only tenable theoretical starting-point. What is more Rawlsian ideal
theory is not merely contingent on sanitizing the history of European
settler colonialism, but more importantly its foundational assumptions
rule out the very possibility of such a just world.]{.underline} [Framed
in this way, Mills writes "the problem does not inhere in exploration of
the ideal...the problem is the exploration of the ideal as an end in
itself without ever turning to the question of what is morally required
in the context of the radically deviant non-ideal
actuality"]{.underline} (p.118). Thus [by diverting attention from
actually existing injustice,]{.underline} ideal theory [codifies
dominance by maintaining the status quo.]{.underline} Evidently Rawls
prioritised ideal theory for what he deemed sound reasons: "the reason
for beginning with ideal theory is that it provides, I believe, the only
basis for the systematic grasp of these more pressing problems that we
are faced with in everyday life." (Rawls, 1999, p.8) 8 Non-ideal theory
then identifies particular socio-political problems in non-ideal
circumstances and then develops strategies on how best to adjudicate
rectificatory justice RJ. Roberts (2002) elucidates what is meant by RJ
in the following claim: rectificatory justice is that form of justice
employed as a means of addressing those situations that arise when the
requirements of a just system of distributive justice have broken down.
(p. 58-59) RJ then concerns a polity's commitment to acknowledging
wrongs and attempting to cultivate trust by setting them right. RJ is
not necessarily contingent on a redistribution of resources. Despite a
wide array of arguments in the literature to the contrary, RJ does not
require reparations. [What RJ requires is an acknowledgement on the part
of a perpetrator of injustice that a breach of justice has been
committed and resulted in an injury to an individual or
group.]{.underline} RJ is a principled approach that holds the core
values of: redress, reconciliation, and acknowledgement and does not
necessitate reparations. How then does non-ideal theory align with RJ?
In contrast to ideal theory, which aims at mapping a perfectly just
society, non-ideal theory recognizes the actual non-ideal state of
affairs and devises ways to adjudicate what measures of RJ ought to be
implanted in societies that are unjust. In the end, Rawls's focus is
almost exclusively on the former aim. [In what follows I expose
multiculturalism's inadequate policy agenda and propose a tripartite
prescription that includes an enhanced model of interculturalism as a
viable alternative.]{.underline} Moreover, interculturalism's focus is
on the integration of all persons into a socio-political collectivity;
instead of clinging to the maintenance of diversity as a central aim,
interculturalism emphasizes the processes and interactions, which
connect and identify individuals and groups in relation to each other.
[Simply put, interculturalism is a 9 pragmatic program; it promotes a
pluralistic polity but avoids the hegemonic tendencies of
assimilationist republican models-- examples include the American
melting pot or France's policy of strict republicanism---and the
centrifugal conventions of Canadian multiculturalism.]{.underline} For
Waddington et al. (2012) interculturalism contrasts with
multiculturalism insofar as it "considers the [acceptance of difference,
mutual respect, and cultural rapprochement to be conditions facilitating
convergence towards a common societal culture" which differs from
multiculturalism, which "promotes diversity as an inherent social
value."]{.underline} (p. 11) In addition, [this thesis makes additional
prescriptive recommendations with the intent of retrieving liberalism
from its fundamentally white dominated epistemology and ideological
discourses.]{.underline} In this way, I argue for theoretical and policy

#### Modern liberalism is challenged now but the state should still act to alleviate the legacy of white domination- the foundational principles of liberalism are solid but it's limits can still be reconceptualized

Few contentious issues have elicited such a mélange of contrasting
outlooks and juxtaposing political objectives as policy of
multiculturalism. Specifically, Canadian multiculturalism purports to
uphold the prominence of individual liberty while acknowledging that
this freedom is only legitimate insofar as it is embraced in the public
sphere and protected by the state. To this end, [the state's
prescriptive actions should aim to alleviate at least some of the
prospective shortcomings that would otherwise occur in a social system
mired in legacies of domination, colonialism, slavery, and whiteness as
a prerequisite for naturalization.]{.underline} Nevertheless, [as Boyd
(1996), Pateman (1988) and Sandel (1984) suggest that notwithstanding
liberalism's fundamental commitments to egalitarianism, impartiality,
and value pluralism, its notion of what counts as reasonable diversity
is constructed and codified along liberal ideological guidelines and
hence carries a liberal partiality from the outset of the
debate.]{.underline} In short, critics of liberal multiculturalism
contend that liberal recognition of minority groups is limited to the
terms set by liberals---that is, those who benefit materially and/or
ideologically from liberalism. [Liberalism is used throughout this
thesis to stand for the intellectual tradition associated with Locke,
Kant, Mill and Rawls.]{.underline} That is to say, [liberalism is the
modern ideological framework that stands for individualism,
egalitarianism and moral universalism. More concretely, liberalism
derives its normative core from a commitment to equal citizenship,
political neutrality, and symmetrical reciprocity.]{.underline} 31
Liberal multiculturalism is an extension of liberal ideology, thus let
me turn now to a synopsis of the ideological principles that lie at the
core of liberalism. [Despite myriad interpretations of liberalism, the
following core beliefs and assumptions underlie much of liberal theory:
a concentration of rights and freedoms on distinct individuals; a
normative focus on freedom, universality, liberty and justice; and a
dedication to viewing persons as politically neutral and morally equal.
In abstract terms, liberalism is the modern ideological framework
developed out of the Enlightenment that stands for individualism,
egalitarianism, and moral universalism.]{.underline} (Mills, 2007 &2013)
More concretely, liberalism derives its normative core from a commitment
to equal citizenship, political neutrality, and symmetrical reciprocity.
The liberal polity purports to oppose ascribing differential or
preferential treatment according to superficial characteristics or group
affiliations. [On the surface then, liberal socio-political ontologies
occupy an obligatory space as a principal condition of a fair polity;
liberalism holds individual equality as the central vehicle for the
pursuit of social justice.]{.underline} In this thesis, diversity will
be broadly referred to as the existence of different cultures, values,
and traditions within the same state, social structure or
socio-political system. The demographic fact of plurality is plainly
observable in the liberal state. Nevertheless, census information alone
provides relatively limited information about the dynamics of
ethno-cultural relations; merely acknowledging cultural diversity offers
little insight into the challenges that liberal immigrant societies seem
to face in perpetuity[. Put another way, modern liberal democracies are
continually challenged with how best to mediate, prescribe, and
negotiate what social membership means for individuals and the
multiplicity of groups that individuals recognize as constitutive of
their identity.]{.underline} What is 32 more, the fact of [diversity
comes with an inherent tension; that is, a society must negotiate and
delimit the boundaries of competing obligations. This chapter is an
examination of liberalism, the liberal dilemma of diversity and the
whiteness of contractarian theoretical frameworks.]{.underline}
Expository treatments of Charles Mills, Dwight Boyd and other [liberal
cultural theorists in combination with critical scholarship on
multiculturalism, critical whiteness discourses, and the components of
the radical liberal interculturalism triad are explained.]{.underline}
This chapter then provides the place from which research into a new
liberal pluralism would begin. In addition, the text describes
multiculturalism as a discourse of white domination. Using both
expository and evaluative voices, [the text challenges]{.underline} [the
legitimacy of liberal commitments to pluralism and raises the spectre of
multiculturalism as a contract that is nominally inclusive but is
actually authored by people who appear or are racialized as white, for
whites and in the interests of whites at the peril of non-white Others
in Canada. This section also introduces whiteness as a problematic
concept and describes the nature of dominance and the forms of white
domination that are intimately linked to liberal traditions and
contractarianism.]{.underline}

### 2AC - Political Engagement Good

#### Political engagement is the only way to solve the problems with modern-day liberalism

**Yzaguirre, attorney, 18** -- (Mark, Arc Digital, "Only Politics Can
Save Liberalism,"
<https://arcdigital.media/only-politics-can-save-liberalism-4917714f4fd2>)
/ncp-AW

The retirement of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy and the
nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh as his successor has spawned an
uncounted number of thinkpieces, including this one, and will continue
to do so for the foreseeable future. These pieces have focused on
everything from whether Roe v. Wade is doomed, whether gay marriage is
doomed and whether Democrats need to pack the courts when they achieve
power. In my judgment, the best piece about the implications of Justice
Kennedy's retirement came out well before his retirement was even on the
horizon. Last year, the author and political scientist Jacob T. Levy
wrote a piece for the Niskanen Center entitled "The Limits of Legalism"
in which he diagnosed [a major problem facing contemporary
liberalism]{.underline} (which in his usage includes a good portion of
libertarians and NeverTrump conservatives). Levy argues that liberals
[have become overly reliant on outside, non-electoral actors to rescue
liberalism from political threats]{.underline}. While the piece begins
with a discussion of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of
potential malfeasance by President Donald Trump and his associates, as
well as the limits that Mueller's investigation faces, it then turns to
a larger point. The larger point is that liberals ["worry about
majoritarianism, and think law can, as politics cannot, protect
individuals and minorities from it" and thus overly rely on the courts
as a mechanism to protect and promote liberal causes.]{.underline} This
leads to an inevitable tension with majoritarian democracy and ends up
**[encouraging liberals to pay less attention to the importance of
winning elections, particularly at the local and state
level]{.underline}** in red or purple states. **[This is a
mistake.]{.underline}** As Levy points out, [an executive who is willing
to push the envelope of legality and is shameless about it can go a very
long way, and the response to that must be political.]{.underline} Levy
writes that **["only politics can save us,"]{.underline}** adding: [If
the independent executive cannot be successfully bound by law, then
there is nothing else for it but politics.]{.underline} I've argued
several times in this space that we need to understand the defense of
the liberal society as a political project. ... The liberal society
needs an electorate, and elected officials, who are willing and able to
stand up for it. Executive authoritarianism and lawlessness can be
hemmed in and checked but not fully constrained by courts, the criminal
law, or the written Constitution. They ultimately have to be confronted
by elected officials: co-partisans willing to exercise serious
restraint, or if not, an opposition voted into office who will do so
instead. This is absolutely correct and it is not a criticism of the
great achievements of liberal jurisprudence. Brown v. Board of Education
led to societal changes that would not have come via electoral politics
in the South, for example. But it is also true that the Supreme Court is
not always a guarantor of civil liberties or anti-majoritarian
protections. After all, Brown was necessary because of the Supreme
Court's prior verdict in Plessy v. Ferguson. The same can be said of the
relationship between Obergefell v. Hodges and Bowers v. Hardwick.
Indeed, one can argue that the courts in general and the Supreme Court
in particular has not been the place to vindicate the rights of the
marginalized in the long run. [Contemporary liberals have become overly
accustomed to liberation via litigation rather than to the long and
unglamorous work of building mass political coalitions]{.underline}. The
Warren Court and the occasional eruptions of liberalism that have come
afterwards from the Supreme Court may be as much of a great exception in
American political history as the politics of the New Deal. The fruit of
this electoral problem can be seen today. Had Democratic voters come out
to vote in the 2014 midterms, Senator Mitch McConnell wouldn't have
taken control of the Senate and he wouldn't have been able to prevent
President Obama from appointing Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme
Court. **[Elections have consequences]{.underline}**, as they say, and
the 2014 midterms certainly did. None of this is a counsel of despair.
Quite the opposite. As David Leonhardt pointed out in a recent New York
Times essay, Democrats hold the advantage on many issues, and [by
winning elections, they can "can keep Republicans from drawing
ridiculous congressional maps and infringing on African-Americans'
voting rights --- among many other things]{.underline}." Leonhardt also
points out that conservative mobilization against what they perceived as
a hostile Supreme Court bolstered the modern conservative movement.
There's no reason why liberals can't mobilize similarly. Perhaps most
importantly, greater emphasis on grassroots-led state and local
political victories, as opposed to creating better litigation strategies
or stressing the importance of winning the White House and causing
change from the top-down, would transform liberal politics. We caught a
glimpse of this approach with the coalition that President Obama put
together in 2008 and it would be a method that would counter the claims
of conservatives that liberalism lacks support from average Americans.
Plus, at this point, **[the political process is the only game in
town]{.underline}**. The Supreme Court isn't going to provide many big
progressive victories anytime soon. And while it may be nice to think
that Robert Mueller will provide findings that will chase President
Trump from office, I wouldn't bet on that. Even if Mueller comes up with
something, impeachment would be the likely remedy and that is a
political process. **[There is no cavalry]{.underline}** from the
courts, law enforcement, or other unelected branches of government
**[coming to the rescue]{.underline}**. And while liberals may dominate
Hollywood and other cultural institutions, that's not where laws are
written. **[The only way out of the current quagmire is through
politics, and Kennedy's departure from the Supreme Court is the wake-up
call for that.]{.underline}**

### 1AR -- Political Engagement Good

#### The law is not perfect, but progress is possible and important for Human Rights

**Rosenfelder 12** (Mark Rosenfelder is an American author and linguist
who graduated from Northwestern University. He has authored books and

Don\'t be a cynic The great theoretical ally of the conservative is
apathy. "That\'s too big a problem to solve. That\'s politically
impossible. You can\'t change human nature. Live in the real world.
Things are always bad. You\'re an ivory-tower idealist." The radical
left-winger or anarchist sounds the same, though. "The problem is
capitalism. They\'ll never allow real change. The system is broken.
It\'s no use marching or writing letters or winning elections. The
liberals are a joke. Don\'t ask us for solutions." The liberal response
is: [change is possible, but it takes work]{.underline}. In 1995, the
idea of gay marriage in the US, or legalized marijuana, seemed
impossible. Universal health care looked like it was dead in the water.
In 1980, the idea of smoking bans, or halving the crime rate, seemed
impossible. In 1935, the idea of letting blacks vote seemed impossible,
and looking around the world, it was hard to imagine the defeat of
totalitarianism. It was assumed that China and India would be
starving-poor forever. In 1900, the idea that the largest class in
society need not be the poor was unimaginable, and the idea of women
voting was considered laughable. In 1840, the idea that slavery could be
abolished in the US was dangerous extremism. In 1750, people would be
astonished and disturbed to hear that in the future most countries would
be republics rather than kingdoms, that large-scale wars would be rare,
that poor men could vote, and that people could freely choose what
religion to believe. This doesn\'t mean that every radical idea will
have its day, nor that progress is inevitable. Sometimes we go backwards
(in fact, as my 'pragmatic' page details, I\'d say we made a major wrong
turn in 1980). But it does mean that a declaration of impossibility is
never an argument. Problems can be fixed Conservatives like to find
something going wrong and imagine that they\'ve refuted liberalism.
Radicals feel that any problem shows that the whole system must be
thrown out. None of these moves bother liberals, because we believe that
problems can be solved. Do divorce laws unfairly favor mothers getting
sole custody? That can be changed (and in fact there\'s been a solid
movement toward joint custody). Was the Obamacare rollout an
excruciating mess? It sure was, and it got sorted out. Is there a
systemic problem of sexual harrassment, or police militarization, or NSA
overreach? There is, and we need to fix it. Another way of putting this
is that we were all taught in school that free enterprise works for
everyone, democracy gives us all a voice, everyone has civil rights, and
any child can become President. We grow up and discover that it\'s not
so true. [The system is broken in big and small ways.]{.underline} But
as an ideal, it\'s great! [There\'s lots of evidence that problems can
be fixed; there\'s no evidence that none can be fixed.]{.underline} So
let\'s work on them. Don\'t hold out for perfection Idealism--- such as
that found in the last paragraph--- is great, and necessary to get
anywhere. [But we can get hung up on the ideal, such that we get furious
at any half-measures and even oppose them.]{.underline} Radicals and
moderates exist in an uneasy balance. For any cause, we need the
radicals and their energy--- and their ability to focus attention on a
problem. But on their own they frighten the undecided, attack each
other, go off on dubious tangents, and burn out in failure. An example
is universal health coverage. Worldwide, the cheapest and most effective
way to provide this is what Canada has--- a single-payer system. That
wasn\'t possible here, so Obama pushed through a market-based system. If
you\'re a radical in any one area, this can be infuriating. You want
full-out, pedal-to-the-metal action on your issue right now. For
example, not a few LGBT activists hated the whole gay marriage push.
They wanted to demolish the patriarchy, not grab one of its perks. But
let\'s look at the scorecard: twenty years later, a) gay marriage is
happening in every state, and b) the patriarchy hasn\'t been demolished.
Which approach actually accomplished something? More subtly, but
importantly: didn\'t this approach at least seriously damage the
patriarchy? The younger generations don\'t just accept gay marriage;
they think that prejudice against queer sexuality is mega-stupid. Now,
there\'s a very human age progression here. The French always seem to
express these things well: Mon fils a vingt deux ans. S\'il n\'était pas
devenu communiste à vingt deux, je l\'aurais renié. S\'il est encore
communiste à trente ans, je le ferais alors. My son is twenty-two. If he
hadn\'t become a communist at 22, I would have disowned him. If he\'s
still a communist at 30, I\'ll do it then. ---Georges Clemenceau
(probably) Or as someone put it on Metafilter recently: "I don\'t like
incrementalism. But long term, it seems to be the thing that works most
reliably." Use the system This one is aimed at both left and right. The
radical left is in love with revolution--- tear down the system and
start over! Conservatives are terrified of revolutions--- they\'re
afraid that liberals secretly want to hang them from the lampposts.
Marxism was a generalization of the French Revolution. Under an
absolutist system, it\'s natural to think that power naturally works
absolutely, and that to fix things, the oppressed classes need to take
power and rule absolutely. We\'ve had 200 years to test the idea, and
the track record is not good. The French, Russian, and Chinese
revolutions soon ushered in tyrannies. If you took power with guns, this
will in itself devastate the economy; plus, you\'ll want to solve every
problem with guns. Guns turn out to be not very good at creating a
country where you\'d actually want to live. The American revolution
emerged from the English bourgeoisie--- that is, English cities, which
were used to elections, laws, and legal rights. Even when they decided
to rebel against the Crown, Americans decided to do so in Congress,
following legal procedures. [The law is not lovely, but it\'s tended to
work far better for both general prosperity and for guaranteeing rights
than revolution. Law is inherently anti-authoritarian\... even when it
derives from authoritarian systems\... because it allows institutions to
be called out on violations of their own law, and because rights granted
to the few become a precedent for extending them to the many. Liberals
have often resorted to the law, to overturn school segregation, to make
schools and police and institutions honor civil rights, to give the Bill
of Rights teeth, to overthrow discrimination against gays and lesbians,
to rein in corporate abuses. To implement your program without
revolution, you need to win election]{.underline}s. In practice, this
means you have to find ways to appeal to the majority. That may mean
making compromises with the oppressors--- as James Galbraith points out,
progressive regulation is generally made by an alliance between
progressives and the top-performing companies. It\'s the poorly run
companies that hate regulation, because they don\'t know how to afford
it. "Get a majority" isn\'t just effective tactics in the system we
happen to use; it\'s also our best guard against making terrible
mistakes, of the sort that produce terrorism and/or concentration camps.
It\'s unjust to impose (say) a new economic system on a population that
doesn\'t want it. If the majority doesn\'t want it, they may in part be
deluded or propagandized, but you\'d better also consider the
proposition that they see a flaw in your utopian scheme that you\'re
papering over. Or that you simply haven\'t worn out the shoe leather
working to bring your ideas to people unlike yourself. Question
authoritarians As a result of some of the above tactics, [liberals have
made very effective use of government and law.]{.underline} In reaction,
we get libertarians who decide that the worst evil is government itself.
This turns out to mean "government doing liberal things"--- i.e.
regulation, social spending, racial integration, preventing depressions.
This is a historical irony, because generally the reactionaries have
been in charge, and liberalism has had to oppose and provoke them. As
late as the \'60s, question authority was a left-wing trope;
conservatives were for Law \'n Order. Nonetheless, liberals aren\'t
simply for "big government". Government is a tool that can either
advance or restrict people\'s liberty and prosperity\... or more likely
both at once. Big government has been used against liberals--- from J.
Edgar Hoover to the Patriot Act to stop-and-frisk laws to the drug war
to anti-gay laws to the voter suppression movement to abortion laws to
police intimidation. But I\'d update the slogan a bit[. Most of the
time, the problem isn\'t authority in the abstract; it\'s
authoritarians--- people who identify with authority and want to use it
to enforce conformity, and who follow their own leaders no matter what
bizarre and sociopathic directions they take.]{.underline}

Marxism's original critique of liberalism, apart from deriding its
(imputed) social ontology, represented liberal rights as a bourgeois
concept. But that was a century and a half ago. **[Lockean
rights-of-non-interference centered on private property, "negative"
rights, are indeed deficient as an exclusivist characterization of
people's normative entitlements]{.underline}**, but **[such a minimalist
view has been contested by social democrats]{.underline}** (some
self-identifying as liberal) for more than a century. [A significant
literature now exists on "welfare" rights, "positive" rights, "social"
rights, whose implementation would indeed require radical structural
change. The legitimacy of these rights as "liberal" rights is, of
course, denied by the political right]{.underline}. **[But that's the
whole point,]{.underline}** with which I began---that **[liberalism is
not a monolith but a set of competing interpretations and
theorizations]{.underline}**, fighting it out in a common arena.27 The
[U.S. hostility to such rights is a manifestation of]{.underline} the
[historic success of conservatives in framing the normative agenda in
this country**, not a necessary corollary of liberalism as
such.**]{.underline} As earlier emphasized**[: liberalism must not be
collapsed into neo-liberalism]{.underline}**. Nor is it a refutation to
point out that having such rights on paper does not guarantee their
implementation, since this is just a variation of the already-discussed
imputation to liberalism of a necessarily idealist conception of the
social dynamic (section #6), in which morality is a prime mover. But
such a sociological claim is neither a foundational nor derivative
assumption of liberalism. Moreover, [in the specific case of the redress
of racial injustice, one does not even need to appeal to such
rights,]{.underline} since the situation of, e.g., [blacks in the United
States is arguably the result of the historic and current violation of
traditional negative rights (life, liberty, property), **which are
supposed to be the uncontroversial ones in the liberal tradition, as
well as the legacy of such practices as manifest in illicitly
accumulated wealth and opportunities.**]{.underline} Here again [the
hegemony of Rawlsian "ideal theory]{.underline}" over the development of
the mainstream political philosophy of the last forty years has had
pernicious consequences, [marginaliz]{.underline}ing [such issues and
putting the focus instead on principles of distributive justice for an
ideal "well-ordered" society.]{.underline} But [an emancipatory
liberalism would be reoriented from the start towards non-ideal
theory,]{.underline} and would correspondingly make rectificatory
justice and the ending of social oppression its priority.28

5\. Liberalism's Values (Independently of the Ontology Question) Are
Themselves Problematic Even if the ontological challenge can be beaten
back, though, another front remains open. [It will be argued that
liberal humanist values are themselves problematic in nature, and
incapable of advancing a radical agenda]{.underline}. [But the obvious
reply is: which values?]{.underline} And what exactly is the problem
supposed to be: (i) that the values are intrinsically problematic? (ii)
that the values involved have historically been extended in an
exclusionary discriminatory way? (iii) that the values have been
developed in a fashion that is predicated on the experience of the
privileged? These are all different claims. Start with the first.
[Admittedly, some values associated with the liberal tradition could be
judged to be intrinsically problematic, such as the "possessive
individualism"]{.underline} C. B. Macpherson famously attributed to
Hobbes and Locke.17 **[But this is a value specific to right-wing
liberalism, not liberalism in general]{.underline}** (it does not appear
on Gray's list), [and would be opposed by left-wing/social democratic
liberalism.]{.underline} Such values as "freedom," "equality" (moral
egalitarianism), and "fraternity/sorority" classically emblematic of the
liberal tradition have not usually been seen as problematic by radicals,
and have indeed been emblazoned on radical banners. [Freedom from
oppression, equal rights/equal pay/equal citizenship (I AM A MAN),
fraternity/sorority with the subordinated ("Am I not a man and a
brother? Am I not a woman and a sister?")---have all served as the
inspiration for progressive movements seeking social
emancipation.]{.underline} To be sure, it is a familiar point to
radicals, if somewhat less so to the non-radical majority, that the
population as a whole has not historically been recognized as deserving
the entitlements of these norms, so that the opponents of emancipation
have all too often themselves been liberals. Freedom has been construed
as justifiably resting on the enslavement of others; equality has been
restricted to those deemed worthy of it; fraternity has been an
all-boys' club. The Italian philosopher Domenico
Losurdo'srecently-translated Liberalism: A Counter-History provides a
devastating exposé of "liberal thought \[not\] in its abstract purity,
but liberalism, and hence the liberal movement and liberal society, in
their concrete reality." It is an illuminatingly sordid history of the
ideology's complicity with racial slavery, white working-class
indentureship, colonialism and imperialism ("A 'Master-Race Democracy'
on a Planetary Scale," in one chapter's title), and the conceptual
connection between the Nazi "final solution" and Europe's earlier
extermination programs against indigenous peoples.18 Yet it is
noteworthy that in his concluding pages, Losurdo still affirms the
"merits and strong points of the intellectual tradition under
examination." His ["counter-history" has been aimed at
dispelling]{.underline} the "[habitual hagiography" that surrounds
liberalism]{.underline}, [and the]{.underline} related "[myth of the
gradual, peaceful]{.underline} transition, on the basis of [purely
internal motivations and impulses]{.underline}, from liberalism to
democracy, or from general enjoyment of negative liberty to an ever
wider recognition of political rights."19 In reality, he emphasizes,
"the classics of the liberal tradition" were generally hostile to
democracy; the "exclusion clauses" required "violent upheavals" to be
overcome; progress was not linear but a matter of advances and retreats;
external crisis often played a crucial role; and white working-class and
black inclusion came at the cost of their participation in colonial wars
against native peoples.20 [Nonetheless, his final paragraph insists:
\[H\]owever difficult such an operation might be for those committed to
overcoming liberalism's exclusion clauses, to take up the legacy of this
intellectual tradition is an absolutely unavoidable task. . . .
\[L\]iberalism's merits are too significant and too evident for it to be
necessary to credit it with other, completely imaginary ones. Among the
latter is the alleged spontaneous capacity for self-correction often
attributed to it. . . .]{.underline} Only in opposition to \[such\]
pervasive repressions and transfigurations is the book now ending
presented as a "counter-history": bidding farewell to hagiography is the
precondition for landing on the firm ground of history.21 So for Losurdo
[one can accept the indictment of actual historic liberalism, and its
failure to live up to its putative universalism, without going on to
conclude either that liberalism must therefore be abandoned, or that
liberalism's own internal dynamic will naturally correct
itself.]{.underline} Rather, **[the appropriate conclusion is that
liberalism can be retrieved,]{.underline}** but that it will take
political struggle to do so. Finally, even when the "exclusion clauses"
are formally overcome, their legacy may well remain in the form of
values now nominally extended to everybody, but in reality articulated
in such a fashion as to continue to reproduce group privilege. [For
example, a "freedom" that repudiates caste status but does not recognize
illicit economic constraint as unfairly limiting liberty, or an
"autonomy" that does not acknowledge the role of female caregiving in
enabling human development, or a "justice" resolutely forward-looking
that blocks issues of rectification of past injustices.]{.underline} But
what such tendentious conceptual framings arguably call for is a
critique and a rethinking of these values and principles in the light of
these exclusions (as with left, feminist, and black liberalism). **[That
does not refute their normative worth; it just underlines the necessity
for taking the whole population into account in revising them and
developing a blueprint of their internal architecture adequately
sensitized to the differential social location and social history of
different groups, particularly those traditionally
oppressed.]{.underline}**

repeating, [especially in the context of the Global South, where people
starve and immediate, even palliative, change is urgent.]{.underline}
**[Reformism is not anathema to postcolonial societies.]{.underline}**
[A fairer legal system]{.underline} that allows the poor to be treated

trials, one that prevents them from being kicked off their land and

anti-liberalism from the Global South anchor their vision of change on a
renewed revolutionary politics that challenges the core structures of
contemporary capitalist societies. For them, another world is possible.
But **[what are political actors in the Global South left to do while

Duterte and the Attack on the Liberal State **[Anti-liberalism in aid of
authoritarianism has a long tradition]{.underline}** in Asia. Pitting
\"Asian\" communal values against Western individualism has [served to
justify various repressive measures]{.underline}, from [racist bumiputra
laws in Malaysia]{.underline} to [press censorship in
Singapore]{.underline}. In India, the communalist rhetoric of [the
H]{.underline}indu [B]{.underline}haratiya [J]{.underline}anata
[Party]{.underline} (Indian People\'s Party) positions itself [against
the \"foreign\" liberalism]{.underline} of intellectuals. For this final
section, I want to examine how [**this same rhetoric has been reproduced
in the Philippines** by the populist strongman Rodrigo
Duterte]{.underline}, who has not only prosecuted a bloody war on drugs,
but has also denigrated and weakened the liberal democratic institutions
of his country. \[End Page 100\] As we saw earlier, the [anti-colonial
liberalism of figures like Rizal birthed the Philippine
nation]{.underline}. The prominence of liberal intellectuals continued
throughout the American colonial period and the postwar period of
independence. Educators pushed for pedagogy that was informed by John
Dewey\'s liberal internationalism (Claudio 2015a), diplomats were
integral to the formation of a global human rights architecture at the
United Nations (Claudio 2015b), and economic debates were centered on
the liberal management of an export industry (Claudio 2017, 45--71). For
many Filipinos, the claim that [their country represented the success of
a US-style liberal democracy in Asia]{.underline} was more than
postcolonial lip service. The country\'s [liberal experiment ground to a
halt in 1972]{.underline}, when President Ferdinand [Marcos implemented
martial law to perpetuate himself in power.]{.underline} The dictator
padlocked congress, arrested activists and opposition leaders, and shut
down what many considered the freest press in Asia. Marcos\'s [downfall
in 1986 restored liberal democracy, but this restored democracy was
fragile]{.underline}. Thirty years after the fall of Marcos, **[another
budding dictator has emerged to challenge the country\'s liberal
tradition]{.underline}**. As a candidate in 2016, Rodrigo Duterte [ran
on a wave of popular disillusionment with]{.underline} the [liberal
reformism]{.underline} of his predecessor, Benigno \'Noynoy\' Aquino III
(2010--2016)---son of former president Corazon Aquino (1988--1992) and
martyred anti-Marcos opposition senator Benigno Aquino Jr. Though
President Aquino and his Liberal Party were consistently popular for the
majority of his six-year term, a congressional corruption scandal and a
botched military operation dented the president\'s reputation during his
final years in office. Moreover, quotidian problems such as worsening
traffic in the already gridlocked Metropolitan Manila area raised
frustration with government. Duterte emerged seemingly out of nowhere, a
little-known mayor from the southern city of Davao. Commentators thought
he would fail to compete with the popularity and machinery of the three
leading mainstream candidates, which included the daughter of the
country\'s most famous action star, the incumbent vice president, and
Aquino\'s interior secretary. Duterte\'s rise was first a blip that
became unstoppable, and it caught Filipino pundits off guard. Yet [his
campaign tapped into]{.underline} multiple dormant impulses in the
electorate: [authoritarian nostalgia, a disdain for Manila-based
politicians, and impatience with reformism]{.underline}. His campaign
tagline, \"change is coming,\" as Anne Applebaum correctly notes, had
\"the same empty appeal as \'make American great again\'\" (2016).
[Like]{.underline} the United States\' Donald [Trump, it was this
emptiness, couched in unbridled anger, which turned Duterte into an
empty canvas for various forms of disaffection]{.underline}.7 From the
fall of the Marcos in 1986 to Duterte\'s assumption of power, the
Philippines had been involved in a slow if uneven process of
redemocratization. Within this period, memories of the bloodless EDSA
\"People Power\" \[End Page 101\] revolution that unseated Marcos became
the organizing mnemonic template of the post-Marcos state.8 Its heroes,
particularly Corazon Aquino (widow of a slain opposition senator and
Marcos\'s successor), became enshrined as the secular saints of the
post-authoritarian republic in a Manichean divide that separated the
forces of democracy and those of the dictatorship (Claudio 2013). During
this period, the country developed a robust, grassroots democratic
culture---largely a product of the various civil society organizations
that emerged from the ashes of the anti-Marcos opposition. Despite the
vibrancy of what political scientist Nathan Quimpo labeled the
Philippine \"contested democracy,\"---led by a free-flowing,
non-Communist Left---certain problems remained intractable (2008). In
particular, violent political dynasties and local machine politicians
continued to dominate regional politics. As Benedict Anderson explains,
the end of the Marcos regime may have ended authoritarianism, but it
brought back the system of oligarch-led \"cacique democracy\" (1998).
Many voters and commentators saw Duterte as a cure to the dominance of
the oligarchs. That Duterte himself came from a local oligarchic
background became irrelevant. His anti-elitism manifested in a
rough-talking rhetorical style that separated him from the cultivated
candidates of the \"establishment.\" The violence began even before
Duterte took office, with [drug-related vigilante killings spiking mere
days after the election]{.underline}. As president, **[Duterte has
overseen the bloodiest display of state power in Philippine
history]{.underline}**. Conservative estimates place the death toll at
7,000 as of August 2017 (Kine 2017). Although there are no accurate
statistics for the death toll under Marcos (the mass killings occurred
in remote provinces), the velocity of killing under Duterte is
unprecedented. Beyond the violence, [Duterte has also poisoned public
discourse and damaged political institutions]{.underline}. Apart from
destroying the reputation of Aquino\'s Liberal Party, [he
has]{.underline} also [challenged the country\'s liberal tradition by
glorifying the late dictator Marcos]{.underline}, whose remains the
president buried in the country\'s hero\'s cemetery. As with most
populists, it is sometimes difficult to determine what Duterte stands
for. It is clear, however, what he is against. [For
Duterte]{.underline}, notes Walden Bello, [**\"the target is
liberal-democracy**---the dominant ideology and political system of our
time\"]{.underline} (2017, np). Much like Trump and Vladimir Putin,
Duterte\'s propaganda machinery relies heavily on networks of social
media trolls who share fake news and promote conspiracy theories. A
primary target of trolling operations and presidential pronouncements
has been the beleaguered Commission on Human Rights (CHR), an
independent constitutional body that seeks to investigate the state\'s
alleged human rights violations. In late 2017, the Duterte-controlled
House of Representatives (the lower house) voted to allocate a mere
P1,000 Philippine pesos (20 USD) for its annual budget, a stunt
celebrated by Duterte\'s online \[End Page 102\] supporters (Cupin
2017). Though the defunding was soon corrected by a more circumspect
Senate (upper house), it sent a message that [the liberal constitutional
framework of the Philippines was collapsing with thunderous
applause]{.underline}. Duterte and his allies **[represent institutions
that promote human rights as hindrances to the president\'s mission of
national renewal.]{.underline}** When the United Nations special
rapporteur on summary executions requested to investigate the killings,
[Duterte]{.underline}\'s government rejected the offer. The president\'s
spokesperson justified the decision by **[claiming that the UN was
seeking to impose \"liberal Western values\" on \"an Asian nation that
places premium on common good\"]{.underline}** The UN was, he concluded,
\"both insensitive and display\[ed\] a lack of appreciation for the
diversity of global culture\" (quoted in Esmaquel 2017, np). Always more
pithy, Duterte himself claimed that, \"if it involves human rights, I
don\'t give a shit\" (quoted in Holmes 2016, np). Alas, Duterte\'s
rhetoric has worked. Into his second year in office, the President
enjoys over 80% approval rating (\"Pulse: Duterte...\" 2017), largely
from a population that does not care how many die as long as it does not
affect them. The triumph of what commentators have called \"Dutertismo\"
is complete, and it proves that [there are, indeed, alternatives to
liberal politics]{.underline}. **[Whether these alternatives are
desirable is a different matter]{.underline}**. Conclusion Global
liberalism is in crisis. Duterte\'s rise in the Philippines is just one
example of the illiberal, populist backlash triggered by multiple
causes, including the inequalities of economic globalization, the
smugness of the liberal elite, and the appeal of strongman rule. It
would be extreme and certainly false to claim that anti-liberal
postcolonial theory or theory from the South caused or even contributed
to the rise of global populism. Doing so would confuse the symptom for
the cause. Yet [we must]{.underline} also [hold intellectuals to task
for failing to rise to the defense of basic common principles anchored
on liberal ideals of dignity, tolerance, human rights, and, yes, a
certain degree of universalism]{.underline}. For the historian Tony Judt
(1988), [what is necessary is a renewed moralism in intellectual
life---the responsibility to confront political excesses and
intellectual flights of fancy]{.underline}. Such an approach would
temper the cynicism, cool detachment, and disdain for the Enlightenment
that defines much writing on the Global South. The anti-liberal
theorizing on the Global South by scholars working in the Global North
may be a safe exhaust valve for their frustrations and boredom with the
liberal democracy they experience every day. Trump notwithstanding,
liberal institutions are stronger in places like the United States and
Europe and can therefore be taken for granted, even maligned. But the
same cannot be said of the Global South, where liberal democratic
institutions can \[End Page 103\] collapse almost overnight, as they
have in Duterte\'s Philippines. [To put things in blunt and moralistic
terms: **my president is slaughtering my countrymen by the thousands,
justifying the murders by dismissing liberalism and human rights as
\"Western.\" I do not have the luxury of \"problematizing\" human rights
as symptomatic of the era of \"neoliberalism.\"**]{.underline} [Scholars
should be careful of the illiberalism they wish for in the Global North,
because we in the Global South just might get it in the form of a
bloodthirsty autocrat]{.underline}. A restoration of liberal democratic
principles in my country is urgent---a matter of life and death. And it
is with this sense of urgency that [we must rethink
liberalism]{.underline} in the Global South, [not as an
endpoint]{.underline} of political development (\"end of history\"),
**[but as the bare minimum of democratic politics]{.underline}**. A
liberalism for the Global South must be simultaneously anchored on
realism and hopefulness. A moralist\'s liberal stance must be anchored
on, to corrupt what Gramsci said for Marxist ends, a pessimism of the
intellect conjoined with an optimism of the will. Except, since
liberalism refuses to foreground a revolutionary break along the
horizon, it leaves more room for optimism. As modus vivendi, liberalism
has no telos; it is never fully complete. Hence it is never fully a
success or a failure. The Global South, like [liberalism]{.underline},
is a provisional and syncretic project, built on imagined networks of
solidarity yet anchored on the necessity of everyday political praxis.
They are both open, because they are both [in perennial
translation]{.underline}. As Arjun Appadurai contends, [it is in
liberalism that we find seeds of cosmopolitanism]{.underline}, because
it is premised on \"self-expansion\" (2005, 434). This self-expansion
may lead us into new theoretical horizons (even new forms of socialism),
but [it will remain anchored on basic principles: the respect for
autonomy, the tolerance of other opinions, and the primacy of human
rights]{.underline}. We uphold these values in both the Global North and
the Global South.

### 1AR -- Alt is Populist

#### Alt fails -- justifies autocracy, populism, and marginalization of the public

**Scheppele, Laurance S. Rockefeller Professor of Sociology and
International Affairs in the Woodrow Wilson School and the University
Center for Human Values at Princeton, 19** -- (Kim Lane, "The
opportunism of populists and the defense of constitutional liberalism,"
German Law Journal 20, 314-331, <https://doi.org/10.1017/glj.2019.25>)
/ncp-AW

In my view, populism has become the obsessive focus of many of us
academics precisely because the criticisms of liberal constitutionalism
made by the populists hit us where we live. Populists expose the
vulnerabilities in the theories that our profession has taken for
granted, and those of us who have defended the democratic integrity of
liberal constitutionalism have been surprised by the way that populists
have deployed theoretical arguments and high-powered tech- nical legal
tools in ways that are hard for us to counter. [Populists are a
challenge to]{.underline} the political systems in which they operate,
but they are also a challenge to those of us who believe in [the
normative defensibility of liberal constitutionalism]{.underline}.
Populists exploit the debates that liberal constitutionalists have with
each other over normative foundations. They mirror and mimic the
language of constitutional liberalism in order to under- mine it in
practice. We-the constitutional liberals-can\'t turn away because we
recognize ourselves in the criticisms that the populists offer. That is
why we focus so intensely on populism. They are getting under our skin.
**[But what do the populists offer in response?]{.underline}** In
addition to the negative case they make against constitutional
liberalism, some populists have begun to develop what appears to be a
sophisticated theoretical framework of their own. If liberalism is full
of contradictions and abstractions, then [illiberalism offers a simpler
theory of political will asserted as power in the world.]{.underline}
[This theory is not populist; \"the people\" have virtually no place in
this theory]{.underline} save as the cheering section for a game played
almost entirely without their active engagement. In other words, [at
least some of new populists are simply autocrats]{.underline}. **[They
counter liberal constitutionalism with an assertion of the justified
power of the singular leader.]{.underline}** In the ideological battle
taking place between constitutional liberals and populists, [the
democratic engagement of a constitutionally constituted people is a
casualty in both. But only the liberals imagine that such engagement is
possible and necessary]{.underline}. To show how this battle of
ideologies works in a concrete case, I will take Hungary as my cen- tral
example, both because I know it well and because the theoretical attacks
on liberal constitu- tionalism as well as the public justifications of
illiberalism are visible in plain sight. If we look at other populist
governments, particularly those in places that value intellectualism, I
am confident that we will see other illiberal theorists in serious
arguments with constitutional liberals over the weaknesses of
constitutional liberalism as well as the assertion of alternative bases
of political legitimation. Once we untangle the theoretical arguments
that at least one set of \"populists\" makes for their own legitimation,
we will see that they are opportunists, taking advantage of the moment
to press a self-interested case. Hungary provides Exhibit A and so I
will start there.

### Alt Fails - Nihilism

The terms of this question and the consequent debate are confusing
because of the lack of definition. Read the current attacks on an
assumed \"Jewish alliance\" with liberalism and you will find that
\"liberalism\" means campus revolutionaries, \"groveling" college
administrators, John Lindsay, Black Panthers, Protestant and Catholic
churchmen who failed to come to our side during the Six-Day War, and
Arthur Goldberg. \" \'The question is,\' said Alice, \'whether you can
make words mean so many different things.\' \" [The word \"liberal\" has
been applied to such a variety of political animals that the meaning is
emptying out of it.]{.underline} [For those who identify with it, it
means \"forward-looking.\" dedicated to social progress, world peace,
human brotherhood.]{.underline} For conservatives, authoritarians on the
right or left, liberal means shilly-shallying, a gentle middle position,
the vacant mind instead of the open mind. For his opponents, the liberal
is \"mealy- mouthed\" and a do-gooder. But **[liberalism is a word that
deserves to be redeemed]{.underline}**. It describes one of the most
productive revolutionary currents of world history. It means commitment
to freedom as both goal and method. Liberalism is not an \"ism.\" It is
a stance-a set of values from which to approach both social and
interpersonal problems. [It makes room for a variety of convictions
about ultimates]{.underline}-from the affirmation that our unalienable
rights as individuals are the gift of our Creator to the nat- uralistic
liberalism of John Dewey and his disciples. [Deists, utilitarians,
philosophes of the enlightenment era, all sought those changes that
would tend toward political freedom and economic democracy.]{.underline}
**[In wanting to liberate men, to free them from \"the dead hand of the
past,\" they were liberals.]{.underline}** [A term should be defined by
its historic intent and its nonnative use -not by the ways in which it
has been misused and misappropriated.]{.underline} And, historically,
liberalism has meant the application of intelligence to human problems.
It has not, in the past, excluded the adoption of revo- lutionary
techniques nor the search for radical solutions. [It is grounded in two
basic presuppositions: I. a concern for people and for humane values;
and 2. an insistence on freedom to think through every problem without
prior ideological constraints]{.underline}. Liberalism is open to the
infinite possibilities of human develop ment. It seeks those changes
that promise to enhance human welfare and human freedom. [It is a
difficult stance, for it demands study. Decision-making must be founded
on knowledge]{.underline}. In an age of sloganeering and the search for
\"instant credibility.\" it requires reading and thoughtfulness-and, as
al- ways, the real enemies are ignorance and sloth. Collectivist creeds
and authoritarian ideologies are beguiling in their freedom from these
re quirements. After the initial conversion, one need only follow. Value
judgments need no longer be made. One can give his full attention to
tactic. **[The alternatives to liberalism are hide-bound traditionalism,
au- thoritarian ideologies or the defense of the status quo. The
alternatives to freedom are the cynical control of the few or the great
beast of mass mindlessness]{.underline}**. Those who call upon Jews
today to \"abandon the liberal alliance\" have adopted a supposedly
pragmatic position founded upon a misuse of the word \"liberalism.\"
Many of those against whom they direct their fire never were liberals
and never even thought of themselves as liberals. And many of those men
and movements who have arrogated the adjective to themselves lack the
qualities and predispositions that define liberalism. [Not everyone who
would like to be thought \"liberal\" acts or thinks
\"liberal.\"]{.underline} This is a fact of life that Ezekiel described
2500 years ago when he [warned against those who cover a tottering wall
with whitewash and cry \"Peace\" when there is none]{.underline}.
Movements of \"national liberation\" have frequently been remarkably
impervious to liberal principles, and so-called \"liberal churchmen\"
act, at times, in illiberal fashion. It should not be surprising that
\"progres- sives\" or advocates of revolutionary change are sometimes
ridden by their own illiberal prejudices. But anti-Semitism \"in
articulate segments of the black community\" is not liberalism, and the
mindless emotionalism of the \"counter-culture\" is not liberalism. What
the argument for a \"divorce\" \[ridiculous figure of speech, since
there has been neither formal betrothal nor informal shiddukh with
modern liberalism\] reduces to, is a demand that Jews plan their
political and civic activities solely on the basis of a calculation as
to what is \"good for the Jews\"\--shades of the second-class
citizenship of pre-Zionist days! One exponent of this view flatly calls
for the endorsement of candidates of \"any political persuasion\" so
long as they are pro-Jewish and pro-Israel. Another says, \"The most
important question, therefore, is: What type of society will be best for
the survival of the Jewish community?\" Do not struggle for the rights
of others, we are warned, because they will neither love you nor repay
you and, in the end, they may even turn against you. No one who takes
seriously the mandates that flow from our jew- ishness could long
sustain this mood of bald self-interest. Hillel\'s paradox is
immediately relevant. Its first part-\"If I am not for myself. who is
for me\"-is wholly pragmatic; the second part-\"If I am for myself
alone. what am I?\"-abandons unadorned pragmatism for a judgment founded
on a universally compelling value. The most important questions.
Hillel\'s position would say, in contrast to the anti-liberalism
question just posed, are: How can the Jew survive, and continue to serve
the values that give meaning to his survival, in any kind of society?
How can he best build the kind of society that will most reflect his
values of individual freedom and human dignity? The mandates of our
heritage would be self-defeating if they re- quired us to cooperate with
forces that would destroy us, but they cer- tainly do not require us to
put our own welfare above the central taslt of tikkun clam, the
perfecting of our world. If [individual freedom, human dignity and an
insistence on the right of man to apply his intelligence, as well as his
values, to the tasks of problem-solving, are the touchstones of the
liberal ideal]{.underline}, it must be evi- dent that it is an ideal
that lies deep within the nature of normative Judaism. The
propltetic-Pharisaic line of concern for the dispossessed. the effort
toward periodic redistribution of the sources of wealth, the specific
provisions for the protection of suangers and slaves. the Talmudic open-
ness to dissenting opinions, and the insistence-revealed in the remark-
able parable about Rabbi Joshua and Rabbi Eliezer-that nothing. not even
heavenly voices, may be allowed to interfere with the democratic process
of decision-making by men, could all be documented to show that there is
a union between Judaisnt and true liberalism which may not be put
asunder. We are, nonetheless, vulnerable to [illiberal
sloganeering]{.underline}. It [feeds on the deep frustrations and the
real fears]{.underline} that are growing in the Jewish community. A
phrase like \"Never Again\" has a powerful effect upon a people that has
lived through a time of unimaginable evil. A rock through a window is an
attention-getter in a world that is siclteningly indifferent. When
frustrations are converted into tactic, we get the ternper-tantrum
techniques of the JDL, of Panthers both Black and Israeli. of Weather-
men and assorted terrorists masquerading as \"guerrillas.\" [But if we
are to apply intelligence to the struggle for freedom]{.underline}-our
own freedom and that of others-**[we must concern ourselves with the
long-range effect of our tactics]{.underline}**. Where\--in terms of
both ends of our paradox-will alliances with conservatives,
fundamentalists and right- or-left totalitarians lead us? What will be
the ultimate result of universal- izing the tactic of terror: using
verbal and physical bombs, deliberately destroying the possibility of
rational discourse, shouting obscenities at women and children. beating
innocent persons. threatening assassination and moving to actual
attempts at murder? [These are the fruits of nihilism -and nihilism is
not compatible with the thoughtful rebellion that seeks justifiable
change.]{.underline} \"Nihilism,\" said Albert Camus, \"confounds
creator and created in the same blind fury.\" It suppresses every
principle of hope, and \"adding to falsehood and injustice, destroys . .
. its original demands and thus deprives rebellion of its most cogent
reasons.\" The shouting match between repression by the powerful and the
desperation of the powerless drowns the quiet voice of reason and pro-
vides the classic situation for the denigration and destruction of
liberal- ism. That quiet voice of reason is the essence of what we have
sought through the centuries. It is supremely important that it be
heard.
