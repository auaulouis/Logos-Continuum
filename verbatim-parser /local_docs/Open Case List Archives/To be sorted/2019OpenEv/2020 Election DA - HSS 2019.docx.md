# 2020 Elections DA

## Notes

### General Notes

This is a helpful link about the role of arms sales in the last
presidential election:
[https://www.forumarmstrade.org/us-presidential-race\-\--candidate-positions.html](https://www.forumarmstrade.org/us-presidential-race---candidate-positions.html).
Feel free to look over the candidates' positions and sales to specific
regions.

### File Notes

The negative file is a Trump Good 2020 Presidential Elections
Disadvantage. The negative should argue Trump will win the presidential
election now, the plan changes circumstances so that Trump loses, and
Trump losing is bad because a second Trump term is good for certain
reasons.

The affirmative can argue that Trump will lose the presidential election
or we cannot know who will win the presidential election, that the plan
does not change election circumstances or the plan changes circumstances
so that Trump wins, or that a second Trump term is not good or actively
bad.

The disadvantage is most strategic against larger affirmatives. If there
are specific links to the affirmative, those should be used instead of
the general link evidence. The hardest part of the DA to win is the
impact, so the most strategic place to spend time is there.

When debating against this disadvantage, the affirmative should inquire
about the specific states that the plan flips.

[President Trump's approval ratings are under water in national polls.
His position for re-election, on the other hand, might not be quite so
bleak.]{.underline}

[[His advantage in the Electoral College, relative to the]{.mark}
national [popular vote,]{.mark} may be [even larger than it was in
2016]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to an Upshot analysis of election
results and polling data.

[That]{.underline} persistent edge [leaves him closer to re-election
than one would think based on national polls]{.underline}, and it might
blunt any electoral cost of actions like his recent tweets attacking
four minority congresswomen.

For now, [the]{.underline} mostly white working-class [Rust Belt
states,]{.underline} decisive in the 2016 election, [remain at the
center of the electoral map]{.underline}, based on our estimates. The
[[Democrats have few obviously promising alternative paths to win
without these battleground states]{.underline}]{.mark}. The president's
approval ratings remain higher in the Sun Belt battlegrounds than in the
Rust Belt, despite Democratic hopes of a breakthrough.

There are signs that some of these voters have soured on his presidency,
based on recent polling. There is also reason to think that white
working-class voters who supported Mr. Trump were relatively likely to
stay home in last November's midterm elections.

A strategy rooted in racial polarization could at once energize parts of
the president's base and rebuild support among wavering white
working-class voters. Many of these voters backed Mr. Trump in the first
place in part because of his views on hot-button issues, including on
immigration and race.

Alone, the president's relative advantage in the Electoral College does
not necessarily make him a favorite to win. His approval rating is well
beneath 50 percent in states worth more than 270 electoral votes,
including in the Northern battleground states that decided the 2016
election.

And just because racial polarization could work to the president's
advantage in general doesn't mean that his particular tactics will prove
effective. The president's campaign rally on Wednesday night seemed, for
a time, to go too far even for him: on Thursday he disavowed the "send
her back" chants that supporters directed toward a congresswoman who
immigrated to the United States as a refugee. (By Friday, he was
declining to condemn the chants.)

But Mr. [[Trump's approval rating has been stable]{.mark} even after
seemingly big missteps. And if it improves by a modest
amount]{.underline} --- not unusual for incumbents with a strong economy
[--- [he]{.mark} [could have a distinct chance to win re-election while
losing the popular vote by more than he did in
2016]{.mark}]{.underline}, when he lost it by 2.1 percentage points.

[The president's relative advantage in the Electoral College could grow
even further in a high-turnout election]{.underline}, which could pad
Democratic margins nationwide while doing little to help them in the
Northern battleground states.

It is even possible that Mr. [[Trump could win while losing the national
vote by as much as five percentage points.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The state of the Electoral College, 2018

The best available evidence on the president's standing by state comes
from the large 2018 election surveys. Their quality is generally high,
and unlike most surveys, they have been adjusted to match actual
election results, ironing out many potential biases of pre-election
polls. Although these surveys are nearly nine months old, the stability
of the president's overall approval ratings means, for our purposes,
that they remain a decent measure of the distribution of his support.

Taken together, the president's approval rating among midterm voters
stood at about 45.5 percent, excluding the voters who did not express an
opinion (for comparability, measures of the president's approval will
exclude voters without an opinion).

By state, the president's approval rating was beneath 50 percent in
states worth 310 electoral votes: the states carried by Hillary Clinton,
along with Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Iowa, Arizona and North
Carolina. This is not exactly good news for the president, but not as
bad as it typically would be given an approval rating of 45.5 percent.
John McCain, for instance, lost states worth 365 electoral votes in 2008
while winning 45.7 percent of the vote.

[The most important measure of the president's strength in the Electoral
College]{.underline}, relative to the national vote, [is
the]{.underline} difference between the national vote and the
["tipping-point state]{.underline}" --- the state most likely to push a
candidate over the Electoral College threshold.

[[Wisconsin was the tipping-point state in 2016]{.underline}]{.mark},
and it seems to hold that distinction now, at least based on the
president's approval rating among 2018 midterm voters.

Over all, [[the president's approval rating was 47.1 percent in
Wisconsin, above his]{.underline}]{.mark} 45.5 percent
[[nationwide]{.underline}]{.mark}. This implies that the president's
advantage in the Electoral College, at least by his approval rating, is
fairly similar to what it was in 2016.

#### Support for arms sales is [key]{.underline} to the working class vote --- [flips the election]{.underline}.

I want to spend a little time talking about one of the reasons why the
trip went so well. I'll warn you: [This is a somewhat taboo]{.underline}
subject [for progressive foreign-policy types]{.underline}. [The
subject]{.underline}, friends, [is arms sales]{.underline}.
[[Progressives]{.mark} don't like arms sales]{.underline} very much,
[but they [need to pay attention]{.mark} to them, [because
they're]{.mark} one [big way Republicans are]{.mark}]{.underline}
fighting for---and [[winning]{.underline}]{.mark}---the [[votes of
working-class]{.mark} Americans [who]{.mark} have **[traditionally
voted]{.mark} for [Dem]{.mark}ocrats**]{.underline}.

While the president was in Saudi Arabia, the Trump administration
announced \$110 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia---with an
additional \$240 billion committed over a 10-year period. If you've ever
worked in government, you know this is what is called a "deliverable,"
the clunky management-consultantese term for a tangible outcome of a
visit or meeting. When Donald Trump is asked to justify his trip to
Saudi Arabia, he'll cite that \$110 billion in arms sales.

There are a few interesting things about these sales. The first is that
many of these sales were already in the works. The Obama administration
spent eight years quietly selling a lot of arms to Saudi Arabia: When
President Obama left office, for example, the United States still had
\$100 billion in the foreign military sales pipeline with Saudi Arabia
and, in 2011, had inked what was previously the largest arms sale in
U.S. history with the Kingdom---a \$29 billion deal to sell F-15s to the
Saudis.

Obama-era sales to Saudi Arabia were in keeping with sales to other Gulf
states: Both Qatar and the United Arab Emirates bought a tremendous
amount of U.S. arms between 2009 and 2017. Qatar bought more U.S. arms
than any other state in 2014 and, in the waning days of the Obama
administration, announced that it would buy nearly \$4 billion in
Boeing-made F-15s in addition to \$19 billion in commercial aircraft,
also from Boeing.

Overall, the Arab Gulf states went on a spending spree during the Obama
years, and most of the money was spent on American arms.

So why didn't you hear a lot about this from Democratic politicians
during the 2016 election season? There are two main reasons---one
strategic and one moral.

Strategically, not everyone is convinced that arming the Arab Gulf
states to the teeth is a wise idea. Some worry that these arms might
someday endanger Israel's security, while others worry the Arab Gulf
states might be encouraged to use their new toys on disastrous military
interventions against Iran or Iranian proxies in, say, Yemen.

[The]{.underline} quick and unsatisfying [answer]{.underline} to these
concerns [is the global market]{.underline}. The Arab Gulf states have
money, and that [money will buy the weapons that are
available]{.underline}. [If U.S. arms are not for sale, fine: French,
Chinese, or Russian arms will be]{.underline}. (And if you don't believe
me, look at the way in which Gulf states---frustrated by U.S. export
controls on drone technology---are turning to the Chinese.) [Selling
U.S. arms to the Gulf states]{.underline}, by contrast, [further ties
them to U.S. interests by deepening cooperation and
interoperability]{.underline} between the U.S. military and its Gulf
partners. One of the reasons Qatar wanted to buy U.S. fighters to
partially replace its French-made fleet, for example, was because they
discovered how difficult it was for their existing fighter aircraft to
fly with the U.S. air force as part of coalitions over Libya and Syria.
 

[Arms sales also drive down the cost of our own weapons and thus the
amount of money U.S. tax-payers have to spend]{.underline} on defense
instead of other priorities like, say, the State Department, school
lunches, or housing subsidies. Here's one example: Because the United
States is buying fewer F-35s than originally planned and using more of
its "fourth generation" fighters (F-15s, F-16s, etc.) in the skies over
Iraq and Syria than previously anticipated, the Department of Defense
will likely need to buy more of those fourth generation fighters in the
coming years. The recent sales of F-15s to Qatar, F-18s to Kuwait, and
F-16s to Bahrain will drive down the cost per plane for the Pentagon.
That's a good thing---at least financially.  

Morally, though, [many progressives just grow ill at the idea of selling
weapons abroad]{.underline}. Senator Chris Murphy, for example---one of
the more eloquent and consistent critics of U.S. arms sales in the
Senate, even though his own state has a very robust defense industrial
base---sees nothing admirable about the idea of selling weapons to the
Saudis that might be used in Yemen. Other progressives agree: Yes, they
argue, we understand the demand of the market will be met by someone,
but do we have to be complicit in providing the supply? In other
countries, progressives have even taken to the courts in an effort to
halt sales.

I have a lot of respect for these progressives and their values. I spent
too much time in Sunday School as a kid to not feel a little uneasy
about the business of selling weapons. And the [angst many progressives
feel about U.S. arms sales has been enough to keep many Democrats from
talking up their successes]{.underline} in helping U.S. industry abroad.
[I wonder]{.underline}, though, [if there isn't a real political cost to
not doing so]{.underline}.

[[Boeing employs 157,000]{.mark} people---almost all of them in the
United States]{.underline}. [14,500 people work in Boeing's facilities
in Missouri]{.underline}, where the F-15 and F-18 are made, [where
Senator Claire McCaskill is up for reelection next year, and where
Donald Trump trounced Hillary Clinton 56 to 38 percent]{.underline} in
2016. ([Those 14,500 people do not include the many thousands of other
Americans who make parts for the F-15 and F-18 elsewhere in
America]{.underline}.)

[Lockheed Martin]{.underline}, meanwhile, a huge winner in the recent
arms deal with Saudi Arabia (despite ace businessman Jared Kushner
negotiating the price down on behalf of the Saudis), [employs an
additional 97,000 workers]{.underline}---again, [most of them in the
United States]{.underline}. [And Raytheon]{.underline}, another big
winner last week, employs another [60,000]{.underline} or so
[Americans]{.underline}.

Donald Trump obviously has no moral qualms about selling weapons to our
partners and allies abroad. And so [while Democrats leave points on the
board with working-class voters by not talking about how much Democrats
do to support U.S. industry, [Republicans]{.mark} swoop in to **[take
credit]{.mark}**]{.underline} with assembly line workers for even those
things that Obama approved and set in motion.

[The [way]{.mark} in which [Trump brags about]{.mark} U.S. arms
[sales]{.mark}]{.underline}, of course, [[is]{.mark} in [keeping
with]{.mark} the strain of economic [mercantilism that]{.mark} ran
through his populist campaign message]{.underline}. [That message worked
with voters throughout the Midwest, helping to [cost Clinton the
election]{.mark}]{.underline}. So while progressives might have moral
qualms about companies that sell weapons, [the roughly 1.2 million
American voters who work in the aerospace and defense sector---together
with the roughly [3.2 million Americans]{.mark} who support the sector
indirectly---[see little wrong with]{.mark} the [sales that]{.mark} help
[ensure]{.mark} their [livelihoods]{.mark} and provide a future for
their children]{.underline}.

This might be another area in which [[progressive
elites]{.underline}]{.mark}---who have the kinds of education and skills
that don't require them to seek work on the assembly
line---[[are]{.mark} simply [out of touch with]{.mark} the [voters they
**need** to win]{.mark} back control of the Congress and state
assemblies, never mind [the presidency]{.mark}]{.underline}. And
politics aside, surely even the moral calculus of arms sales gets more
complicated when you think about the millions of American mouths that
are fed by mothers and fathers who work in the aerospace and defense
sector.

[Donald [Trump]{.mark}]{.underline}, for his part, [[is speaking to
those voters]{.underline}]{.mark}. And even as
[progressives]{.underline} fret about U.S. arms sales, they [should also
fret about what it will mean for the rest of their agenda when
Republicans claim credit for protecting some of the last good
assembly-line jobs in America]{.underline}.

#### Trump's [future hardline]{.underline} foreign policies are vital to deter China and prevent [nuclear war with North Korea]{.underline}.

To its credit, [the [Trump]{.mark} administration has [adopted a]{.mark}
much more [clear-eyed approach to China]{.mark} that breaks with many of
the errors of the past. The president's [confrontational trade policy
could lead to concessions]{.mark} from the Chinese government
[that]{.mark} his immediate **[predecessors]{.mark} sought but [could
not get ]{.mark}**[through]{.mark} traditional [diplomatic
means.]{.mark} And on Oct. 4, 2018, Vice President Mike Pence delivered
the toughest speech on U.S.-China relations by a U.S. administration
since former U.S. President Richard Nixon opened up the
relationship.]{.underline} "China now spends as much on its military as
the rest of Asia combined, and Beijing has prioritized capabilities to
erode America's military advantages on land, at sea, in the air, and in
space," Pence said. "China wants nothing less than to push the United
States of America from the Western Pacific and attempt to prevent us
from coming to the aid of our allies." Although his withdrawal from the
Trans-Pacific Partnership and constant confrontations with U.S. allies
have weakened his administration's China policy, [Trump's political push
to address the increasing dangers of Chinese power is more
important]{.underline}---because his successor can remedy these
mistakes. [[Without the president]{.mark}'s initiative, Washington might
well have continued sleepwalking as [Beijing drew]{.mark} large parts of
[Asia]{.mark} into its orbit and [away from the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}

[Trump should also be given credit for his policies toward North Korea,
Saudi Arabia, Syria, Afghanistan, India, and Venezuela]{.underline},
among others.

[Regarding North Korea, [Trump]{.mark}'s strategy to this point has
calmed the situation and [reinvigorated]{.mark} the [negotiating]{.mark}
track through the first meetings at the highest level in the history of
the relationship. [He]{.mark} has **[addressed]{.mark}, at least
[temporarily]{.mark}**,]{.underline} what matters most to vital U.S.
national interests: [the suspension of North Korea's nuclear and
intercontinental missile tests, which represent direct threats to the
U.S]{.underline}. mainland. At a minimum, [he has delayed the moment
[when]{.mark} a U.S. president would have to either stand by while
[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea progressively [expanded]{.mark} its
[nuclear]{.mark} weapon [and ballistic missile capabilities]{.mark} or
[attack]{.mark} its nuclear and missile sites[, which could lead to a
**nuclear war on the**]{.mark} **Korean [Peninsula and
beyond.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Back in December, I penned an op-ed here making the case that President
Donald Trump would likely win reelection. At the time, Newsweek
insinuated I was off my rocker. They were not alone; throngs of folks on
social media and via email informed me that I probably rode the short
bus to school in my early years and that everyone would be better served
if I just went away.

Well, I'm here to tell you that [[Trump i]{.mark}s even [closer]{.mark}
[to winning reelection now than he was at the end of last
year]{.mark}]{.underline}. I am not alone in this observation. The Cook
Political Report's Amy Walter is seeing the playing field much the same
way I am.

[Heading into 2020, [Trump's primary strengths remain incumbency]{.mark}
--- since 1900, nearly 80 percent of incumbent presidents have been
reelected]{.underline} --- [[and the economy]{.mark}. Since FDR, [every
incumbent president, "who has avoided a recession in the lead-up to an
election year was reelected]{.mark}."]{.underline} A trade truce or deal
with China will most likely ensure a recession does not occur before
next November.

Contrarians point to national polls and the slew of battleground state
surveys, including Florida, and argue Trump is losing "bigly" to a
handful of candidates and is therefore toast. The situation is certainly
not ideal for Trump, but [early polling from previous presidential tilts
suggests the media and anti-Trump forces are getting way ahead of
themselves]{.underline}. Who can forget that in June of 1983, eventual
Democratic nominee Walter Mondale was leading President Ronald Regan by
10 points or that [in]{.underline} June [of 2011 a generic Republican
presidential candidate was leading President Obama by 5
points]{.underline}?

Unless something totally unforeseen happens such as a major military
conflict, the global economy tanks, a Thomas Eagleton situation grips
the Democratic Party, Trump becomes ill, etc., [[this is going to be a
close race]{.underline}]{.mark} --- the country is just that evenly
divided, [[and]{.mark} thus the race [will]{.mark} likely [be decided
b]{.mark}y just [a handful of states]{.mark}]{.underline}. (Florida,
North Carolina, Arizona, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.)

The biggest hurdle the Trump reelect faces is that his disapproval
rating has hovered above 50 percent for quite some time. The Democrats
can thank their willing accomplices in the press big time for that.

So what does Trump need to do to win reelection? His team can start by
taking a page out of the 2012 Obama campaign playbook --- and that is
precisely what the Trump campaign is doing.

As Obama 2012 campaign aide Ben LaBolt points out, recent successful
incumbent presidents prevailed "by executing a two-year campaign to
exploit a contentious primary on the other side, reconnect with their
base of supporters, and define the election as a choice, not a
referendum." After all, who can forget Mitt Romney being labeled a
serial dog-abuser long before he received the 2012 Republican
presidential nomination as a result of once taking a family trip with
the dog riding in its crate on the car roof?

Yes, the Trump reelect didn't officially kick off until mid-June of 2019
in Florida; a must-win state for Trump and the crown jewel of his
campaign's electoral strategy. But since March, [the president has held
numerous rallies in]{.underline} other key [battleground states to
remind his core supporters exactly what is at stake in
2020.]{.underline} Given that Trump is a dogged campaigner, this will
most certainly continue.

What has been eluding the Trump campaign is how to best disqualify the
2020 Democratic field before the party is able to officially select a
nominee --- but the campaign's prayers may have been answered thanks to
an assist from Democrats themselves. Yes[, the [Democratic contenders
have been o]{.mark}n an insane [race to the left in an effort to win
over their primary voters]{.mark}]{.underline}. From single-payer health
care and the elimination of private health insurance to free college and
massive student loan debt forgiveness to letting imprisoned convicts
vote, there seems to be no line they aren't willing to cross in their
pandering. Normally, all of this would be disqualifying on its face, but
it hasn't yet proven to be an albatross for the blue team's general
election chances.

That all changed during the second night of the first Democratic
presidential debates in Miami. When former Vice President Joe Biden,
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), South Bend,
Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and the others on the debate stage all raised
their hands indicating their respective government health plans would
provide coverage for illegal immigrants, they gave the Trump reelect the
opening it needed to move 2020 from a referendum on Trump to a choice
election.

This came as part of a one-two punch to working-class voters given that
in the previous night's debate, former Housing and Urban Development
Secretary Julián Castro called for the decriminalization of illegal
border crossings.

Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez can claim that
government health care for illegal immigrants "is not a handout" until
he is blue in the face. But what he and the 2020 Democrats fail to
appreciate is exactly how tone-deaf their stance is in terms of the
voters they need to recapture the White House in 2020; those residing in
the more than 200 Obama-Trump "pivot" counties.

On illegal immigration, 2020 Democrats aren't even trying to hide the
ball. Their message is loud and clear: Every illegal immigrant who
crosses the border for whatever reason should not be detained and just
about all should get to stay indefinitely --- complete with benefits
from free health care to free education and maybe even free puppies by
the time this campaign is over.

And when it comes to the taxpayer's dime, what voters are hearing is
that illegal immigrants come first and certainly before Americans
citizens and the working class. Even New York Magazine's Andrew
Sullivan, who is no fan of Trump, is proclaiming that "the Democratic
candidates are in a bubble on immigration.

[[We are still a long way from Election]{.mark} Day 2020; [things
could]{.mark} certainly [change]{.mark}. But at the rate the Democrats
are going, it's hard to see how Trump doesn't win a close
one]{.underline}. Stay tuned.

#### Trump will win now- economy, Dems race left, and Trumps political instinct ensure

**Sandman 7/26/19-** Joshua Sandman is an internationally recognized

appeal of President Donald J. Trump as a populist outsider candidate and

In a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll many Americans reported that
they are dissatisfied with President Donald Trump and find his behavior
grossly offensive. Yet, [[Trump appears on course for
reelection.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Why? [First, [a good economy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Presidents who
preside over a strong economy are favored to be reelected.

[Second, Trump is a [master at gaining media attention and dominating
narrative]{.mark}]{.underline}. Reality TV gave Trump an understanding
of what plays well on broadcast media. [His unfiltered Tweets lay out
his agenda, attack opponents, and directly communicate with the national
audience.]{.underline}

[Third, Presidential elections are determined by state electoral
votes]{.underline}, not by popular vote. [[Trump maintains strong
support in key battleground states in the industrial
Midwest]{.underline}]{.mark} and in traditional Republican leaning
states.

Most states and regions have become reliably Democratic or Republican.
The 2016 presidential election saw three states --- Pennsylvania,
Michigan, and Wisconsin --- Democratic since the 1980's, give their
electoral votes by narrow margins to Trump.

[Fourth, [Trump has excellent political instincts. His attack on the
"squad]{.mark}"]{.underline} of four left-leaning House Democrats [[was
brilliant political strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}. It has proven popular
with his base and succeeded in wedding the "squad" of progressive,
controversial lawmakers to the Democratic Party.

Prior to Trump's attacks, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and many House
Democrats attempted to restrain the "squad" from attacking and from
encouraging primary challenges to moderate Democratic House members.
They were also distancing the party from the left-leaning agenda of the
"squad." The [Trump attacks forced Pelosi and Democrats to support the
"squad" and mute any criticism of their behavior or agenda.]{.underline}

[Fifth, [deep]{.mark} and seemingly unbridgeable [divisions among
Democrats help Thump]{.mark}]{.underline} --- especially in battleground
states. Progressive-left and moderate Democrats are at odds over
election tactics, strategy, and policy direction. Progressives have
distanced themselves from a working class negatively impacted by
globalization and unfair trade practices.

Progressives embrace liberal cultural and social values, open borders, a
globalized economy, extreme environmental policies, government-only
medical coverage, and extensive social safety-net programing.

Unfortunately, [they believe that appealing to the moderate social and
cultural outlook of the working class would compromise the progressive
agenda]{.underline} and would be futile. Therefore, they say, 'why
bother?'

They assume that a progressive presidential candidate will attract
enough women, people of color, young voters, the better educated, and
those who have succeeded in the new economy to give the Democrats an
Electoral College victory. They believe that this coalition is the new
backbone of the Democratic Party.

Their assumption is unproven, and this coalition does not as yet
constitute a majority in key rust belt battleground states. Worse, it
repeats the flawed strategy of the 2016 Hillary Clinton campaign.

[Trump could not hope for a better scenario.]{.underline} He is assured
free range among the working class --- once the backbone of the
Democratic Party coalition. An overlay of voting in counties dominated
by the working class in battleground states shows President Obama's
voters supporting Trump in 2016.

[[Progressive voters will not support a moderate Democratic candidate
and moderate voters will not support a progressive Democratic
candidate]{.underline}.]{.mark} Not a good situation for Democrats.
Without unity, no Democratic candidate can prevail.

Finally, [Trump maintains populist appeal. Populists]{.underline}, like
[Trump, reach out to the common citizens who believe that their
interests and concerns are not addressed by establishment]{.underline}
governing, economic, and social institutions.

And Trump offers corrective public policy action to resolve long-ignored
problems such as globalization (reassess global alliances and commerce);
unfair trade (impose tariffs); illegal immigration (restrict
immigration).

[Defeating Trump will not be easy.]{.underline} His character flaws and
offensiveness were well known prior to the 2016 election. He still won.
Trump would like to make the 2020 election about the "squad." Democrats
must avoid taking Trump's bait.

Democrats need to put together a winning coalition of states that gives
them an Electoral College victory. They need to reach out to their
former working-class base, acknowledge their concerns and values, and
offer viable solutions to the problems that impact them. Then perhaps a
Democratic candidate can beat Trump.

[1. Everybody has already made up their mind about Trump --- and his
numbers stink]{.underline}

Right now, [[Trump's net approval rating is minus 8.5 percentage
points]{.underline}]{.mark} in the RealClear Politics polling average[.
Fivethirtyeight]{.underline}.com [says it's minus 10, as [53%
disapprove]{.mark}]{.underline}, 43% approve and 4% won't say. That
spread was first "achieved" in March 2017. [[Trump hasn't narrowed
it]{.mark} below nine [since]{.mark}]{.underline}, Fivethirtyeight says.

In other words, no one's changing their minds about Trump. About 40% of
us like his act, if only to "own the libs." [Everyone]{.underline} else?
Nope.

2\. [[His state numbers are]{.mark} just as [bad]{.mark}]{.underline}

Oh, but the Electoral College! says Twitter, where confident young
people educate me about their hero's resilience in Midwestern
battlegrounds where he snatched victory from popular-vote defeat in
2016. Thanks for that. Really.

Like, [[in Michigan]{.underline}]{.mark}, where Morning Consult [puts
[Trump's]{.mark}]{.underline} net [approval [at minus
12]{.mark}]{.underline}? Trump's Michigan numbers haven't been green in
26 months. Morning Consult says he's doing two points worse than in
October, before [[Republicans lost two]{.mark} House [seats there and
the]{.mark} [governorship]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Trump's polling in [[Wisconsin?]{.underline}]{.mark} He's [[minus
13]{.underline}]{.mark}. In [[Iowa, minus 12]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
his party lost two of its three House seats.

[[In Pennsylvania]{.mark}, birthplace of former Vice President and
possible 2020 rival Joe Biden]{.underline}, [Trump is [minus
]{.mark}]{.underline}**[7]{.mark}, a point worse than last fall.**
Democrats won the generic House vote in Pennsylvania by 10 points.

[[Just on those four, Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark} 306 2016 [[electoral
votes fall to 254]{.mark} (270 needed to win) [and it's
over]{.mark}]{.underline}. But as many as 215 Trump electoral votes
could be in play, based on state-by-state polls.

### They Say: "Too Soon" 

#### It's [not]{.underline} too early --- this contest is a [marathon]{.underline}.

Donald Trump didn't declare he was running for president until June
2015. Bill Clinton waited until October of 1991 to announce his
campaign. And Ronald Reagan didn't make it official until November of
1979 --- just 69 days before the Iowa caucuses.

But [this year, the [2020 election]{.mark} campaign [is]{.mark} already
[kicking into high gear with more than a year]{.mark} to go
[before]{.mark} the country's [first]{.mark} [primary]{.mark} voters
make their choice]{.underline}. Five Democrats, including Sen. Kamala
Harris of California, have already declared their intention to run for
president, with three more launching exploratory committees that make
them all-but-certain contenders.

[The [hopefuls make up]{.mark} the [biggest field]{.mark} out of the
gate [at this point of the campaign]{.mark} in decades --- [part of a
long-term trend that's **transformed**]{.mark} the [presidential contest
from a **sprint to a marathon**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[["It used to be]{.mark} that [people would pretend they hadn't]{.mark}
quite [made up their minds,"]{.mark} said Bob Shrum, director of the
Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern
California and a strategist who's worked on numerous Democratic
presidential campaigns]{.underline}. [["Now they aren't
pretending]{.mark} any more.["]{.mark}]{.underline}

Harris, 54, who holds her first rally at noon Sunday at Oakland's Frank
Ogawa Plaza, announced she was running on Good Morning America on Martin
Luther King Jr. Day --- 378 days before the Iowa caucuses. That's the
earliest official announcement by any top-tier candidate, excluding
incumbents, since Jimmy Carter in 1976, according to a Bay Area News
Group analysis.

Faced with the prospect of a massive field, candidates like Harris, Sen.
Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New
York are betting that getting in early will guarantee them a moment in
the spotlight and help them lock down key donors and supporters. And
several other candidates are expected to jump in within the next few
weeks.

["It becomes kind of a game of chicken," said Bruce Schulman, a Boston
University historian]{.underline} who studies the history of
presidential campaigns. ["As some people get in early,
[candidates]{.mark} who want to recruit staff or raise money [need to
follow]{.mark} suit, [or]{.mark} else [they'll be left
behind."]{.mark}]{.underline}

[made it clear that]{.mark} Crown Prince [M]{.mark}ohammed [b]{.mark}in
[S]{.mark}alman [was there to finalize arms sales]{.mark} he had made
during his trip to Riyadh in May.]{.underline} Just 40 seconds into
their meeting, Trump pulled out a cardboard chart listing the billions
of dollars in arms sales the United States is doing with the Saudi
regime.

DONALD TRUMP: Some of the things that --- have been approved and are
currently under construction and will be delivered to Saudi Arabia very
soon, and that's for their protection. But if you look, in terms of
dollars, \$3 billion, \$533 million, \$525 million.

BEN NORTON: [Within 90 seconds of their meeting, Trump then pulled out
another cardboard chart, this one showing the [U.S. states]{.mark} that
[are manufacturing these weapons.]{.mark} The map makes it clear that
[Trump is using]{.mark} these massive [arms sales to gain support
in]{.mark} what the chart describes as ["key states"]{.mark} --- those
that will be [**important in the 2020** election, including the **Rust

Florida.]{.mark}]{.underline}

DONALD TRUMP: And that have been ordered and will shortly be started in
construction and delivered: the THAAD system --- \$13 billion; the C-130
airplanes, the Hercules, great plane --- \$3.8 billion.

BEN NORTON: [What [Trump did not acknowledge]{.mark} is that these
billions of dollars of U.S. [weapons]{.mark} are being [used to massacre
Yemeni civilians.]{.mark}]{.underline} In fact his meeting with the
Saudi crown prince came in the same week marking the third anniversary
of the Saudi war on Yemen.

Saudi Arabia has used this U.S. military equipment to relentlessly bomb
civilian areas in Yemen, including hospitals, schools, residential
houses, refugee camps, and even funerals. The U.S.-backed Saudi
coalition has killed many thousands of Yemeni civilians, pushed millions
to the brink of famine, unleashed an unprecedented cholera outbreak, and
created what the United Nations says is the largest humanitarian
catastrophe on Earth.

[Trump expressed no concern whatsoever over the millions of lives being
crushed in Yemen.]{.underline} Nor did he even mention the egregious
human rights abuses committed by Saudi Arabia and its de facto leader
Mohammed bin Salman, who has been purging his political rivals,
imprisoning human rights activists, and crushing all dissent.

[Instead, Trump made it clear that [his political strategy is to]{.mark}
sell weapons and [rely on]{.mark} \$400 billion of [Saudi investment in
key states that]{.mark} can **[help him win
re-election.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

DONALD TRUMP: And the other thing that I really am very happy about is
that we talked about 400 billion dollars' worth of investment, of which
we've already invested and seen invested \$200 billion to our companies,
to various other places, and people that make things.

[So a lot of places throughout the United States are benefitting by this
massive investment made by Saudi Arabia to buy product from the United
States.]{.underline} And again, we make the best military product in the
world, whether it's missiles or planes or anything else. There's nobody
that even comes close.

It's one of those stories of the century that somehow never gets treated
that way. For an astounding 25 of the past 26 years, the United States
has been the leading arms dealer on the planet, at some moments in near
monopolistic fashion. Its major weapons-producers, including Boeing,
Raytheon, and Lockheed Martin, regularly pour the latest in high-tech
arms and munitions into the most explosive areas of the planet with
ample assistance from the Pentagon. [In recent years, the bulk of those
[arms have gone to the]{.mark} Greater [Middle East.]{.mark} Donald
[Trump]{.mark} is only the latest American president to preside over a
global arms sales bonanza. With remarkable enthusiasm, he's [appointed
himself]{.mark} America's number one [weapons salesman and]{.mark} he
[couldn't be prouder of]{.mark} the job he's doing.]{.underline}

Earlier this month, for instance, on the very day Congress was debating
whether to end U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's brutal war in Yemen,
[Trump engaged in one of his favorite presidential activities:
**[bragging about]{.mark} the [economic benefits]{.mark}** of the
American arms sales he's been promoting. He was joined in his moment of
braggadocio by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman]{.underline}, the
chief architect of that war. That grim conflict has killed thousands of
civilians through indiscriminate air strikes, while putting millions at
risk of death from famine, cholera, and other "natural" disasters caused
at least in part by a Saudi-led blockade of that country's ports.

That Washington-enabled humanitarian crisis provided the backdrop for
the Senate's consideration of a bill co-sponsored by Vermont independent
Senator Bernie Sanders, Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee, and
Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy. It was aimed at ending U.S.
mid-air refueling of Saudi war planes and Washington's additional
assistance for the Saudi war effort (at least until the war is
explicitly authorized by Congress). The bill generated a vigorous
debate. In the end, on an issue that wouldn't have even come to the
floor two years ago, an unprecedented 44 senators voted to halt this
country's support for the Saudi war effort. The bill nonetheless went
down to defeat and the suffering in Yemen continues.

[Debate about the merits of that brutal war was, however, the last thing
on the mind of a [president]{.mark} who [views his]{.mark} bear-hug
[**embrace of the Saudi regime** as a]{.mark} straightforward [business
proposition.]{.mark} He's so enthusiastic about selling arms to Riyadh
that [he]{.mark} even [brought]{.mark} his very own prop to the White
House meeting with bin Salman: [a]{.mark} U.S. [map highlighting
which]{.mark} of the 50 [states]{.mark} would [benefit most from]{.mark}
pending weapons [sales]{.mark} to the prince's country.]{.underline}

[You undoubtedly won't be surprised to learn that [Michigan, Ohio, and
Florida, the three]{.mark} crucial [swing states in the]{.mark} 2016
[presidential election, were]{.mark} specially
[highlighted]{.mark}.]{.underline} His latest stunt only underscored a
simple fact of his presidency: [Trump\'s [arms sales]{.mark} are meant
to [promote **pork-barrel politics**]{.mark}]{.underline}, while pumping
up the profits of U.S. weapons manufacturers. As for human rights or
human lives, who cares?

#### Saudi sells are key to collecting electoral votes.

President Trump wants to use his emergency powers to sell billions of
dollars' worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia on national security grounds.
Congress wants to stop the sale because of lingering anger over Saudi
abuses and the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and the usurpation
of its legal authority to review arms sales. Both sides are ingenuous.
[The [willingness to sell]{.mark} the [Saudis weapons has]{.mark} little
to do with American national security, and [everything to do with
economics and politics]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Congress has looked the other way for decades]{.underline} as
administrations of both parties have sold some of our most sophisticated
weapons to the Saudis. President Obama sold the Saudis \$112 billion in
weapons over eight years, including a record \$60 billion package in
2010, and reportedly was prepared to sell another \$115 billion in 2016.

Both branches of government understand the Faustian bargain America made
long ago with the kingdom. The Saudis sell us oil, and we help guarantee
the survival of the monarchy. [By moderating the price of oil, the
[Saudis help the American econ]{.mark}omy[, which benefits the
president]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Selling arms gives the regime a sense
of security, while allowing us to get money we spend on oil back,
benefiting US defense contractors, and **[creating jobs in states where
a president needs to collect electoral votes]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In 1981, a majority of the Senate initially disapproved of the sale of
AWACS radar planes to the Saudis, partly because of the potential threat
they posed to Israel. The Reagan administration preposterously argued
the planes couldn't endanger Israel, but would allow the Saudis to
defend themselves from the Soviet Union. Adding to the absurdity, the
Saudi defense minister threatened to turn to the Soviets if the US
didn't sell them the planes.

More important was the fact that more than 700 corporations in 42 states
had contracts with Saudi Arabia. Each of these, in turn, had hundreds of
subcontractors, all of whom shared the principals' interest in keeping
the Saudis happy. The presidents of Boeing, the main contractor for the
AWACS, and United Technologies, which had \$100 million at stake, sent
out more than 6,500 telegrams to subsidiaries, vendors, and suppliers
all over the country urging them to lobby for the sale. The president of
the US Chamber of Commerce wrote to every senator the day before the
AWACS vote, and 860,000 recipients of the Chamber's newsletter were
advised of the adverse consequences for US trade if the sale were not
approved.

The AWACS sale went through after Reagan twisted enough Republican arms
to reverse what seemed a certain defeat.

How did the Saudis show their gratitude? OPEC raised the price of oil,
and the Saudis announced a production cutback. The kingdom also
denounced Oman for participating in a US military exercise and offered
money to the emirate if it canceled an agreement allowing America access
to its military facilities. The Saudis subsequently opposed US policy
towards Israel, Lebanon, Egypt, the PLO, Syria, and Libya.

[Bill [Clinton]{.mark}]{.underline} shared Reagan's economic and
political motivation when he [[convinced]{.mark} the Saudis to sign
[a]{.mark} \$7 billion [deal]{.mark} for commercial
aircraft]{.underline}. [Clinton subsequently [took credit for]{.mark}
creating an estimated [100,000 jobs]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The [states
benefiting]{.mark} from the deal [were]{.mark} worth [122 electoral
votes]{.mark} in the forthcoming election]{.underline}.

When President Trump had finished mocking the field of Democratic
presidential candidates at a rally in Florida this week ("Sleepy Joe,"
"Crazy Bernie" and "Boot-edge-edge"), he pivoted abruptly to his
intensifying trade war with China. The segue was no accident: Mr.
[[Trump is determined to present]{.mark} himself [as tougher on]{.mark}
the [Chinese than]{.mark} any of his potential [challengers]{.mark} in
2020]{.underline}.

["Representing us against President Xi of China," a sarcastic Mr. Trump
said of]{.underline} Pete [Buttigieg]{.underline}, the young mayor of
South Bend, Ind. ["That'd be great."]{.underline} [Taking aim
at]{.underline} former Vice President Joseph R. [Biden]{.underline} Jr.
earlier in the day, [he said]{.underline} that [China had pulled back
from a trade deal because it wanted to wait him out]{.underline} and
negotiate with a President Biden or "one of the very weak Democrats, and
thereby continue to rip off the United States."

Election-year politics have crept into Mr. Trump's trade policy.

For months, [the prospect of a landmark trade agreement with China has
tantalized]{.underline} Mr. [Trump]{.underline}. [But now, according to
analysts and several former aides, his political calculus seems to have
flipped]{.underline}. His recent statements suggest [he now believes
that demonstrating his [toughness]{.mark} with the Chinese and walking
away from a deal might]{.underline} well [[put him in a **better
position politically**]{.underline}]{.mark} than signing one.

Imposing new tariffs on China is likely to hurt American farmers, rattle
the stock market and possibly damage the economy. But [signing an
[agreement could expose]{.mark} Mr. [Trump to **attacks by
Dem**]{.mark}**ocrat[s]{.mark}**, particularly if it is perceived as
weak]{.underline}. [A [hard line]{.mark}]{.underline}, on the other
hand, [[would]{.mark} allow the president to [cater to]{.mark} his
political [base]{.mark} while heading off any Democratic attempts to
outflank him as the great protector of American workers]{.underline}.

["The days of being soft on China are over," said]{.underline} Stephen
K. [Bannon]{.underline}, the former White House chief strategist for Mr.
Trump, who shaped the economic message of his 2016 campaign and has
warned repeatedly about the dangers posed by China. "Politics now drives
the economics."

[[Bashing China is a well-worn election]{.mark}-year
[tactic]{.mark}]{.underline} for both Democrats and Republicans. But Mr.
Trump has upended the usual practice by pursuing actions against China
that are every bit as aggressive as his campaign messaging. His
protectionist instincts defy mainstream Republican orthodoxy and align
him more with progressives like Senators Bernie Sanders, independent of
Vermont, and Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts.

Mr. Sanders has vowed to label China a currency manipulator ---
something Mr. Trump had promised to do during his campaign but was
talked out of by advisers. And he has criticized Mr. Biden for voting
for permanent normal trade relations with China and for saying, during a
recent campaign stop in Iowa: "China is going to eat our lunch? Come on,
man."

"It's wrong to pretend that China isn't one of our major economic
competitors," Mr. Sanders said in a tweet. "When we are in the White
House, we will win that competition by fixing our trade policies."

Several of Mr. Trump's current and former aides --- including Mr. Bannon
and Peter Navarro, his trade adviser --- have long argued that being
tough with China and never accepting a deal is the right course. They
were countered by more mainstream figures like Treasury Secretary Steven
Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow, the president's chief economic adviser, who
warned Mr. Trump that a prolonged trade war would buffet both the
economy and financial markets.

In recent weeks, however, Mr. Trump's [campaign advisers]{.underline}
have also started to echo the no-compromise approach, according to a
former official. That, [combined with]{.underline} Mr. [[Biden's
potential]{.mark} political [weakness on China]{.mark}, has
[shifted]{.mark}]{.underline} Mr. [[Trump's thinking]{.mark} away from
those who urged a deal]{.underline}.

#### Democrats will [pounce]{.underline}.

**Landler and Swanson 5/10** --- [Mark Landler]{.underline}, London
bureau chief of The New York Times, member of the Council on Foreign

Accessed 07-24-2019)

It is not clear whether Mr. Trump has reverted from the eager deal maker
to the anti-China hawkishness of the 2016 campaign. The risks of an
all-out trade war are considerable. Political analysts said voters were
likely to judge the president's actions by how they affected their
economic fortunes, not by whether he looked tougher than the Democrats.
To some extent, that is true even of Mr. Trump's supporters.

"They have been willing to give him the benefit of the doubt because he
is addressing the issue," said David Winston, a strategist who advises
Republicans. "Their attitude is, 'We're with you in wanting to do this,
but ultimately, it's got to produce a positive impact for the country.'"

Yet [[there are]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[political
risks]{.underline}]{.mark} for Mr. Trump [[in]{.mark} agreeing to [a
deal, particularly if]{.mark} he ends up with an agreement that has the
same [lack of teeth]{.mark} as those of his predecessors]{.underline}.
[[Dem]{.mark}ocratic [candidates would]{.mark} most likely
**[pounce]{.mark}** on that [as ev]{.mark}idence that Mr.
[Trump]{.mark}'s blustering style [does not produce
results]{.mark}]{.underline}.

["A weak deal]{.underline}, including one that does not stop cybertheft
by China, [will be another proof point for Democrats to say that at the
end of the day, Trump just doesn't get the job done," said Geoff Garin,
a veteran Democratic pollster]{.underline}.

Mr. Garin said his firm had conducted research for Democrats that showed
undecided and independent voters were troubled by the decline in the
income of farmers because of Chinese retaliation for Mr. Trump's
tariffs.

"The China trade situation is particularly important because it ties his
impulsive and erratic nature to real-world consequence for Americans, in
terms of leaving many workers and farmers worse off than before," he
said.

[Republicans are planning a multimillion-dollar offensive aimed at

Spearheading the push is the Republican Jewish Coalition, which receives
substantial funding from casino mogul and GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson.
On Friday morning, the group's board members --- many of them prominent
Republican Party donors --- gathered in a conference room at Adelson's
Venetian resort, where they were briefed on plans for a \$10
million-plus blitz geared toward attracting Jewish support for President
Donald Trump. The investment, people familiar with the early discussions
said, will far surpass what the group spent in past presidential
elections.

[Republican side,"]{.mark} Brooks added]{.underline}.

At a time when Trump's approval rating remains mired in the low- to
mid-40s, the offensive shows how Republicans are taking steps to contest
any votes they can. Jews only account for about 2 percent of the U.S.
population and have overwhelmingly supported Democrats in past
elections. But GOP officials believe that [siphoning off [even]{.mark} a
[small portion]{.mark} the [Jewish vote in]{.mark} a few [**battleground
states** could be **critical in 2020**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"The Jewish vote will remain and largely loyal Democratic vote because
of domestic issues largely, but if there was ever a cycle where
Republicans could make inroads, it is this cycle," said [Ari Fleischer,
a former George W. Bush White House press secretary]{.underline} who now
serves as an RJC board member. ["If you accept that there are sizable
Jewish populations in Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania \[and\] Michigan, the
[Jewish vote]{.mark}]{.underline} --- if we can make additional inroads
--- [[can be **very helpful in putting you over the
top**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The White House knows that.["]{.underline}

[The administration is all-in on the strategy]{.underline}. On Saturday,
Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and three White House officials ---
Jared Kushner, Jason Greenblatt, and Avi Berkowitz --- all made
pilgrimages to the Venetian, where RJC members were gathered for the
third day of their annual spring conference. Before a sea of supporters
waving "We are Jews for Trump" signs, the president accused Democrats of
opposing Israel and "advancing by far the most extreme, anti-Semitic
agenda in history."

Donald [[Trump landed]{.mark} in the White House [by winning three Rust
Belt states Democrats]{.mark} had [carried]{.mark} in previous elections
\-- Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \-- and his [re-election could
hinge on whether he can hold them.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[It won't be easy.]{.underline} On the eve of the 2016 vote, Trump vowed
at a raucous late-night rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to bring
transformative change. "Michigan stands at the crossroads of history,"
he said. "[If we win Michigan, we will win this historic
election]{.underline} and then we will truly be able to do all of the
things we want to do."

[Trump returns]{.underline} to Grand Rapids on Thursday night [with his
promise of a Rust Belt renaissance unfulfilled. Across all three states,
Trump and his party have struggled since his election: public opinion of
him has eroded; Republicans lost badly in November's midterm elections;
and according to a Federal Reserve measure of state-level economic
performance, Michigan and Pennsylvania continue to trail the U.S.
overall.]{.underline}

In Wisconsin, where economic conditions have kept pace with U.S. growth,
Trump's approval rating is nonetheless underwater.

Some of the president's allies have begun to worry. ["[If Trump doesn't
win Michigan]{.mark} in 2020[, he isn't going to be president]{.mark},"
said Steve Bannon, Trump's former campaign chairman and White House
strategist.]{.underline}

buffeted]{.mark} for decades [by]{.mark} global [economic trends that
**hollowed out the manufacturing sector** and ravaged
paychecks.]{.mark}]{.underline} He also took a hard line against the
North American Free Trade Agreement and China's trade practices. [[That
pitch proved]{.mark} just [strong enough]{.mark} for him [to
win]{.mark}: Trump's 77,000-vote margin of victory in Michigan,
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin delivered his Electoral College victory over
his Democratic opponent]{.underline}, Hillary Clinton.

["A lot of these [blue-collar Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark} do feel that
the president has stopped the U.S. from getting sand kicked in its
face,"]{.underline} said John Brabender, a Republican consultant who
works on campaigns in Pennsylvania. ["But these [are incredibly
fluid]{.mark} voters and [the race will]{.mark} probably [come down to
them]{.mark} once again. [If those Democrats switch]{.mark} back in
places like Pennsylvania and Michigan, it's going to be really hard for

While Democrats wade through a marathon of intra-party debates, the
national punditocracy is increasingly asking two urgent questions about
the impending 2020 presidential contest: [[Can]{.mark} President [Trump
win Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin again]{.mark}? And can he win a
second term without those three states?]{.underline}

Both questions reflect a stark reality in American presidential
elections: [[The presidency is won]{.mark} or lost [in the Electoral
College]{.mark} \-- a body dominated by a handful of large so-called
battleground states that can determine the outcome.]{.underline}

[Donald [Trump triumphed in 2016 by winning]{.mark} narrowly these three
[Rust Belt states]{.mark}]{.underline}, which he was expected to lose.
Pennsylvania was the biggest surprise as well as the biggest prize among
them. In theory, Trump can win without these three \-- either by
replacing them with three other large states \-- or by picking up
several smaller states that equal their combined 46 electoral votes.

### They Say: "Rest Belt States Non-Unique"

There's probably a measure of truth to this. [[Trump's approval]{.mark}
in Michigan, for instance, lags [at 44 percent]{.mark}]{.underline},
according to CNN exit polls; the state re-elected a Democratic senator
without much fanfare, as well as a new governor, and several
well-established GOP House incumbents were ousted.

But [another interpretation is that [Republicans were never]{.mark} all
that [popular in Michigan]{.mark} to begin with]{.underline},
notwithstanding Trump's squeaker of a victory two years ago. [[He
won]{.mark} the state [in 2016]{.mark} not because of some fortuitous
rejuvenation of the Republican brand, but [because of]{.mark} the
heterodox nature of [his campaign style and policy
platform]{.mark}]{.underline}. Put another way, he won in spite of being
a Republican: not because of it.

Under this theory, [Trump's fortunes in the Midwest haven't sagged much
at all]{.underline}. In fact, notwithstanding Republican losses this
week, [there's a case to be made that [Trump is]{.mark} actually [more
popular in Michigan]{.mark} today [than]{.mark} he was [in
2016]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to the very same CNN exit poll,
[Trump's favorability rating in Michigan was only 39 percent two years
ago, even though he won the state with 48 percent of the
vote.]{.underline} [Many [people who didn't]{.mark} particularly [like
Trump]{.mark} evidently [voted]{.mark} for him
[anyway]{.mark}]{.underline}. If voters continue to distinguish in their
minds between Trump and the wider GOP, whose lackluster governance led
to major losses in Congress, that will be decidedly to Trump's political
advantage.

### 2NC/1NR --- Swing States Key 

#### Trump wins important midwestern states now --- plan reverses. 

**Olsen 19** --- Henry Olsen, Washington Post columnist, Senior fellow
at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, BA in Political Science from
Claremont McKenna College, JD from the University of Chicago Law School,
2019 ("If the latest polls are right, Trump is favored to win
reelection," *Washington Post,* July 8^th^, Available Online at

Accessed On 07-24-2019)

The headline news from the most recent Post poll was that President
Trump remains behind or tied with all major Democratic contenders. The
takeaway should have been that if this poll is correct, [Trump is almost
a lock to win.]{.underline}

There are two reasons that this is the case. The first has to do with
the electoral college; the second has to do with the likely campaign
dynamics over the next year and a half.

[Trump won the electoral college in 2016 despite receiving roughly 46
percent of the popular vote because his coalition is highly tilted
toward non-college-educated white voters.]{.underline} Those voters are
shrinking as a total share of the national electorate, but [they remain
the largest group of voters in the electoral-vote-rich states of the
Upper Midwest that he flipped from blue to red. That means Trump will
get higher shares of the vote in those states than he will
nationally.]{.underline}

The [Post's poll showed Trump performing nationally at levels that
suggest he would get close to or more than a majority of the vote in at
least four of the five key Midwestern swing states]{.underline}. Take
his job approval rating: The poll showed him at 47 percent approval
among registered voters. The 2018 exit polls showed Trump's job approval
was higher than his national average by three points in Wisconsin and
eight points in Ohio. [By extrapolation, the Post poll implies his job
[approval is at]{.mark} or above [50 percent]{.mark} in enough states
for him to carry the electoral college.]{.underline}

[Trump's standing gets stronger when we look at the mock ballot
questions]{.underline}. He receives between 46 and 48 percent of the
vote among registered voters against any Democrat except Joe Biden. [[In
2016]{.mark}, [he ran]{.mark} about 1.5 to 2 points [ahead]{.mark} of
his national showing [in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.]{.mark}
There's [no reason to think]{.mark} that [he won't do the same in
2020]{.mark} given the nature of his coalition.]{.underline} That means
the Post poll implies he will get between about 48 and 50 percent in
each of these states. If he does that, he almost surely will win at
least one of them --- and with that, he wins reelection.

[Democrats could point to recent polls showing Trump's standing in these
key states to be lower than he needs to win. But we should take most of
these polls with a grain of salt. [In]{.mark} both [2016 and
2018]{.mark}, [state]{.mark}-level [polls in]{.mark} Midwestern [swing
states]{.mark} significantly [underestimated]{.mark} support for
[Republican]{.mark} [candidates]{.mark}. There's no reason to think that
any of these state-level polls have worked out their methodological
kinks in the past six months.]{.underline}

[The Morning Consult poll that tracks Trump's job approval rating by
state is also unreliable]{.underline}. That [poll showed Trump's net job
approval rating in November 2018 at zero in Ohio, minus-10 in Wisconsin
and minus-2 in Arizona]{.underline}. [But the exit poll, which samples
actual voters, put his net approval rating at plus-7 in Ohio, minus-four
in Wisconsin and plus-2 in Arizona]{.underline}.

[[The campaign]{.mark}'s likely [dynamics]{.mark} also [mean]{.mark}
these [numbers are more a floor than a ceiling on]{.mark} his potential
[support]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Trump is a divisive figure, to put it
mildly.]{.underline} But although opinions on him and his performance
are fixed[, his job [approval rating]{.mark} has slowly crept up over
the past five months so that it now [stands at 45 percent]{.mark} in the
RealClearPolitics average.]{.underline} One can see those numbers
declining in the case of war or recession, but it's hard to see why a
normal campaign season will drive his support lower than it already is.

The opposite is true for Trump's opponents. With the exception of Biden,
his [Democratic opponents are nowhere near as well known as he is,
giving him plenty of opportunity to define his opponent as that person
emerges.]{.underline} That's what happened in both 2004 and 2012, the
last two times an incumbent ran for reelection. Presidents George W.
Bush and Barack Obama both broke into significant leads in early
September as voters focused on comparing the incumbent they knew with
the challenger they didn't. Indeed, the Post poll showed Trump leads \"a
Democratic candidate who you regard as a socialist" by six points. With
almost every Democrat running as far left as they can to appeal to the
party's progressive wing, [it seems likely that 2020 will see another
election-year break for the incumbent.]{.underline}

### 2NC/1NR --- Jewish Vote

Why such focus on [[Jewish]{.mark} voters]{.underline} when they
represent only 2-3 percent of the national electoral mix, and are
concentrated in overwhelmingly blue states (New York, New Jersey,
Illinois, California)? [These [voters are a]{.mark} potentially
[deciding factor in swing states]{.mark} with often tiny margins of
victory.]{.underline} [In the Sunbelt, these include North Carolina, and
in the Rust Belt, Ohio]{.underline} and Pennsylvania. But [[the]{.mark}
real [target is Florida, where the estimated 470,000 Jewish voters
constitute 3.4 percent of the total.]{.mark}]{.underline} A [slight
[shift in the]{.mark} Jewish [vote here can determine the outcome of
a]{.mark} presidential [election]{.mark}]{.underline} or control of the
U.S. Senate. So the stakes are high. If enough Jews in these states who
traditionally vote Democratic can be peeled off, using the canard of
left-wing anti-Semitism, the results can be decisive.

An apparent dry run for this [[strategy took place in
Florida]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2018. Jewish
[[Rep]{.mark}ublican[s]{.mark} [charged that]{.mark} Andrew
[Gillum]{.mark}, the Democratic nominee for governor, [supported]{.mark}
the [BDS]{.mark} movement.]{.underline} Though the charges were
demonstrably untrue, [Republicans, led by State Representative Randy
Fine, who is Jewish, repeated them through the election.]{.underline}
[[Gillum]{.mark} [lost the race]{.mark} by 30,000 votes]{.underline},
out of more than eight million cast. In the same election, Democrat
[Nikki [Fried]{.mark}, who is Jewish]{.underline},
[[won]{.underline}]{.mark} her statewide race for agriculture
commissioner by 6,000 votes[, [consistently outpolling Gillum in Jewish
precincts]{.underline}]{.mark}[, especially in South
Florida.]{.underline}

[[New Delhi saw foreign policy opportunities in Trump's
victory.]{.mark}266 Here was [an American president]{.mark} who
[might]{.mark}]{.underline} be susceptible to Prime Minister Narendra
Modi's charms and consequently [forge a close relationship with
him]{.underline}; be more restrained in using force abroad while
continuing to [protect the rules-based international system, thus giving
India more sway to advance its own vision of a multipolar global
order]{.underline}; seek to improve relations with Moscow, a longtime
Indian ally, thereby aiding India's resolve to avoid choosing between
the United States and Russia; put less pressure on India regarding
climate change and peace with Pakistan; [and---most important---take
robust measures to [check]{.mark} the threatening dimensions of [China's
increasing power.]{.mark}]{.underline}

This last issue most preoccupies Indian strategists both inside and
outside the government. New Delhi is convinced that [China is pursuing
policies to replace the United States as the primary power in Asia, and
that such [a development would be]{.mark} exceedingly [bad for
India]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}267 As one senior Indian policymaker
privately stressed, "The most fundamental issue of world order is the
rise of China, and it is so momentous that it should make every other
government reexamine the basic principles of its foreign policy."268

[President Trump's inclinations, as conveyed through [his South Asia
strategy]{.mark}, which [accords primacy to India]{.mark}; his release
of advanced weapons systems, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, for sale
to New Delhi; and his decision to treat India on par with NATO allies
where strategic technology release is concerned are all viewed as
favorable toward India]{.underline}.269 New Delhi has, accordingly,
responded with bold initiatives of its own. Although it has not entirely
endorsed the Trump administration's Indo-Pacific strategy, [it has
applauded the strategy's declared vision of a "free and open"
Indo-Pacific region]{.underline}---a concept first articulated by
Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, with whom Prime Minister Modi enjoys
an exceptionally close relationship.270

In addition, India has quietly---and sometimes not so quietly--- begun
to cooperate militarily with the United States in significant ways even
in peacetime. Today, driven again by common concerns about China,
Washington and New Delhi have begun to exchange serious intelligence
information, undertake ambitious combined military exercises, and
discuss the acquisition of advanced military technologies that would
[help both [states cope with the **expanding Chinese military
presence**]{.mark}, especially [in the Indian Ocean]{.mark}. In
September 2018]{.underline}, after a meeting between the U.S.
secretaries of defense and state and the Indian ministers of defense and
external affairs, [the two countries signed the Communications
Compatibility and Security Agreement, a deal that allows the United
States to share advanced secure communications technology and that the
Obama administration could not finalize.]{.underline}271

[Although **[these initiatives]{.mark} still [have far to go]{.mark}**,
it is significant that they have begun]{.underline}---especially for a
country that not too long ago swore eternal fealty to nonalignment.
These evolutionary but significant shifts in India's strategic posture
have been driven by its own national interests, but in every instance
they advance America's strategic objectives as well.272 This
transformation in Indian policy is grounded in the conviction that
though improved relations with China are desirable, [[there is no
assurance that they will]{.mark} suffice to [protect India]{.mark}n
security [in the face of]{.mark} growing [Chinese power.]{.mark} Only
strong security ties with the United States]{.underline}---in tandem
with other important countries such as France, Israel, Japan, and
Russia---[can provide such comfort at a time when India is still some
distance away from realizing its own great power ambitions.]{.underline}

On [the economy, [Trump's biggest triumphs for liberty are in the area
of regulation and taxes]{.mark}.]{.underline} [On regulation, Wayne
Crews of the Competitive Enterprise Institute finds that in
[Trump]{.mark}'s first nine months, he [issued 58 percent fewer
"significant rules" than Obama]{.mark} had issued in the corresponding
nine-month period of 2016. [A significant rule is]{.mark} defined as
[one that has an impact of \$100 million or more.]{.mark}]{.underline}
To really understand the significance of those regulatory changes one
must, of course, examine the details of each. But one example of a
regulatory change in process will give a flavor of some of Trump's
deregulatory moves. In 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency issued
a rule asserting the EPA's jurisdiction over even ponds, swamps, and
potholes on farmers' lands. In response to a lawsuit, the Sixth Circuit
Federal Appeals Court stayed the regulation in October 2016, and Trump
has reopened the process to modify the rule.

Here's how Christopher DeMuth, a distinguished fellow with the Hudson
Institute and former president of the American Enterprise Institute, has
evaluated Trump's regulatory policies in a recent Wall Street Journal
op-ed:

With some exceptions (such as business as usual on ethanol), and putting
aside a few heavy-handed tweets (such as raising the idea of revoking
broadcast licenses from purveyors of "fake news"), [President Trump has
[proved to be a full-spectrum deregulator.]{.mark} His administration
has been punctilious about the institutional prerogatives of Congress
and the courts]{.underline}. Today there is a serious prospect of
restoring the constitutional status quo ante and reversing what seemed
to be an inexorable regulatory expansion.

Professor Weiner, in his brief segment on Trump's executive actions on
regulation, seems to agree with DeMuth.

On taxes, the United States had one of the highest corporate income tax
rates in the developed world, and, with the new tax law, that rate has
fallen from 35 percent to 21 percent, putting the U.S. rate somewhere in
the middle of existing corporate tax rates[. [Besides letting
corporations]{.underline}]{.mark} [(which, by the way, are owned by
actual people) [keep more of their income]{.mark}, [the tax cut will
attract capital from around the world.]{.mark} With more capital, [labor
productivity will be higher and]{.mark}, therefore, [so will the real
wages of U.S. workers]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Moreover, the tax bill moves the United States to a territorial
corporate income tax system whereby corporations are taxed in the
jurisdiction in which they earned their income. Most countries have such
a system; the United States was unusual in taxing U.S. corporations
based on their worldwide income.

On the individual income side, the tax law cut marginal tax rates
somewhat, making up for much of the revenue loss by restricting to
\$10,000 the amount of state and local taxes that individuals could
itemize on their tax returns. This huge change, combined with an
increase in the standard deduction to \$24,000 for married couples
filing jointly, will cause millions of taxpayers in high-tax states to
feel the full bite of their local and state taxes rather than being
implicitly subsidized by taxpayers in low-tax states. [Why is this good
news for the country? Because [taxpayers in low-tax states should not be
forced to pay for California's, New York's, and New Jersey's]{.mark}
high [rates]{.mark} of taxation. Moreover, there is one unintended [side
benefit: there will be more pressure on the high tax states to cut
taxes.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 2NC/1NR --- Trump Foreign Policy Good

#### Trump's foreign policy is more successful than past administrations

**Means 18**. Grady Means is a Stanford University-trained economist, a
writer, and former corporate strategy consultant who served in the White
House as an assistant to Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, \["In
defense of Trump's foreign policy", 7-24-18, *San Francisco Chronicle*,

The conduct of foreign policy is often thought of as the primary
responsibility of a U.S. president. Because of its existential
importance to the security of our country, the disturbing Delphic
utterances of President Trump in Helsinki and thereafter have sent
spasms through the Western foreign policy and intelligence communities.

I am not an apologist for the president --- I didn't vote for him (or
Hillary Clinton). I didn't and still don't think he has a firm grasp of
history and global issues, and so I have no dog in this fight --- but
the American system, "of the people," as some like to say, presumes some
level of fair-mindedness, and I think a little perspective and
reflection is in order here for the good of the country.

[In that vein, from my perspective, the [concrete results of the
president's policies have not been]{.mark} all [that bad]{.mark}. As
opposed to his immediate predecessors, [he has not gotten us into a huge
catastrophe]{.mark} in Iraq (in fact, he has not gotten us into any big
shooting war). He has not gone on an embarrassing global apology tour to
autocratic Muslim countries who treat women like dirt. He has not
telegraphed our moves in Afghanistan and Iraq, emboldening our enemy and
leading to loss of American lives.]{.underline}

[And, for the moment, [he has stopped nuclear and missile expansion in
North Korea]{.mark} as opposed to Presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton
and Barack Obama, who all claimed to have stopped North Korea's nuclear
program. Not to "conflate," but [he is way ahead of his more articulate
predecessors on many counts --- the ones that actually
count]{.mark}.]{.underline}

So what is Trump's foreign policy? It appears to have something to do
with positioning and making deals, although we would need to use IBM's
Watson computer running a million variations of game theory to fully
understand his logic and approach. But that does not make it wrong. It
just makes it confusing.

[Let's take [his "relationships"]{.mark} [with]{.mark} Russian President
Vladimir [Putin and]{.mark} Chinese President [Xi]{.mark} Jinping. What
must they think?]{.underline}

[My guess is that they are totally baffled. On the one hand, [he meets
Putin]{.mark} in Helsinki [and Xi]{.mark} at Mar-a-Lago, [strokes their
egos in public,]{.mark} calls them "good guys" whom he respects, and
[tells the world that we can do business with them. Then he]{.mark}
dramatically [expands the defense budget]{.mark} (aimed at China and
Russia), takes the advice of the command leadership to [streamline
military response and effectiveness]{.mark}, [moves a good portion of
the Pacific fleet to the coast of China and North Korea, and directly
challenges China over the islands in the S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina
[S]{.mark}ea.]{.underline}

He TWICE draws a red line on chemical weapons in Syria and enforces it
(as opposed to his feckless predecessor) with cruise missile attacks,
and then attacks and kills Syrian and Russian forces committing
genocide. He provides lethal weapons to Ukraine to fight Russians,
creates a better balance between the Shite and Sunni forces in the
Middle East, re-strengthens our alliance with Israel, starts a mini
trade skirmish with China to force a needed discussion on intellectual
property theft that his predecessors were afraid to have, refocuses
foreign policy on Asia and firms up the alliance with Japan.

[Then [he expands our energy resources]{.mark} and [strengthens our
alliance with Saudi Arabia]{.mark} to give the United States a decisive
say in global energy supply and pricing and creates an existential
threat to Russia and Iran, kicks NATO and EU leadership (which each led
his predecessors around by the nose) in the rear for their historically
cynical and mercantilist policies, [expands NATO funding and strengthens
it significantly]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[He [puts our cyberwarfare systems on an offensive footing, and,]{.mark}
most importantly, [strengthens]{.mark} the most crucial factor of U[.S.
foreign policy]{.mark} --- [the U.S. economy]{.mark}, [and secures the
dollar as the unrivaled reserve currency]{.mark} in the world, a
powerful weapon that underpins all trade and major deals
worldwide.]{.underline}

I have no idea what the guy is thinking.

I often have no idea what he is saying, but, objectively, I feel a lot
safer today than I did under his past several predecessors. I cannot
mind read the guy and have no interest in writing "Trump Agonistes," in
the vein of Gary Wills' book about Nixon. But, to paraphrase Teddy
Roosevelt, "Speak incoherently and carry a big stick," seems to be
working for him. President Richard Nixon was described by his aide John
Ehrlichman as the "mad monk," combining foreign policy strategy with
unpredictable execution. Well, Trump has certainly nailed that one.

[In global hot spots, [North Korea has actually stopped making headlines
with nuclear tests and missile launches]{.mark} (although that may
change any day), and [Iran is falling apart from within due to American
sanctions]{.mark} and the awful economic policies of the regime, and in
spite of the quisling, mercantilist, cynical (I repeat myself) policies
of the European Union.]{.underline}

[The Magnitsky Act [sanctions]{.mark}, which bar individuals complicit
in human rights abuses from traveling to or owning assets in the West,
are still in place (and [expanding) on Putin's cronies]{.mark}, and
[that]{.mark} really [annoys and threatens the Russian
leadership]{.mark}.]{.underline}

America lives in a tough neighborhood. Many of the largest and most
dangerous countries are run by hoodlums: They would all laugh at the
conversations and social theories espoused in cocktail parties in New
York and Nantucket, Mass., San Francisco and Hollywood.

[I do believe that peace comes from strength. So, maybe, just maybe, [we
have a president who actually understands our enemies]{.mark} and speaks
their language at an instinctive and visceral level. His political
vocabulary is very different: It is not pretty; It is not "diplomatic."
From a conventional perspective, [it is "cringe-worthy." But that does
not necessarily make it wrong]{.mark} in defending America's
interests.]{.underline}

The Trump foreign policy is like the administration's domestic policy: a
little irreverent, ambitious, and completely impervious to the warnings
and pressure of the "expert class." [[Despite early fears]{.mark} that
President Donald [Trump]{.mark} would pull American leadership back,
would disengage in global affairs, and retreat to a dangerous
isolationism, he [is reasserting American strength and seizing bold
initiative after initiative]{.mark}, [leading partners and allies in the
direction he wants the free world to go.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Make no mistake, he's no multilateralist, not in the sense the word is
commonly understood. He does not seek consensus before he makes a bold
move, nor does he care if his actions agitate Justin Trudeau or Emmanuel
Macon or Angela Merkel. But he is happy to have nations join him when he
makes a move.

The Trump "America First" has little in common with the "America First"
of 1940. [Instead, [he is leveraging]{.mark} his two biggest
assets---[the world's largest economy and military]{.mark}---[to]{.mark}
aggressively [compete with those nations that are daring to
threaten]{.mark} the United States.]{.underline}

As the Trump policy documents---the National Security Strategy, National
Defense Strategy, and Nuclear Posture Review---outline, the
administration is aggressively taking on both Russia and China. Both
nations, similarly autocratic and revanchist, have been defying calls to
respect sovereign borders and democratic elections, threatening US
allies both rhetorically and with military deployments, and developing
weapon systems to hold at risk highly valuable US radar, ships, and
satellites. Both are waging constant and overwhelming cyberattacks
against private sector and government entities. China, in particular,
has taken the long view and is challenging not just American interests
but also America's global leader mantle.

Throw in the rogue nations North Korea and Iran, which have attached
themselves to Russian and Chinese autocrats who are happy to use them
against America, and Trump and his hawkish team of national security
advisors aren't intimidated at the idea of taking all of them on at
once.

Now, the administration is doing this in a rather disjointed, often
surprising, and sometimes unsettling way. And that's part of the Trump
foreign policy, too. The method is important. Rather than being guided
by an overarching policy, implemented by a strategy that has gone
through the interagency process, President Trump acts on instinct,
rarely seems to doubt his own judgment, and jumps from one massive task
to the next. A new trade deal with Canada and Mexico, demanding more
money and military contributions from NATO allies...or else, demanding
at least a commitment from North Korea's Kim Jung-un to dismantle his
nuclear program, and insisting on getting a better trade deal with South
Korea, even as Trump plays hardball with North Korea.

[Whether it's with trade, arms control agreements and treaties,
sanctions, or military investments and operations, one primary principle
propels [the Trump foreign policy]{.mark} agenda forward: [the
unapologetic assertion and strengthening of American
sovereignty.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Just when one thinks the president has withdrawn from the last treaty or
agreement for a while, he announces he's withdrawing from another. The
president or one of his advisors, upon announcing withdrawal, explains
how it has disadvantaged the United States. [The [president has no
tolerance for]{.mark} that. [Unnecessary agreements,]{.mark} which were
either negotiated poorly or have simply transitioned with time into
irrelevance and weaken the US, inhibit America from reaching greater
prosperity at home and limits its range of actions and influence
abroad.]{.underline} The Paris Climate Accord, the Trans-Pacific
Partnership (TPP), the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA, or Iran Deal), US
participation in the UN Human Rights Council and the UN Relief and Works
Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), and the
Universal Postal Union, the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces
Treaty---they're all history. When the International Court of Justice
warned the US not to allow new sanctions against the Iran regime to
violate a 1955 treaty with Iran, the Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations
and Consular Rights, the administration, unfazed, simply withdrew from
that treaty, too. For some of them, new agreements are now in place, for
others, nothing. And President Trump loses no sleep taking the "no deal"
option over a bad one.

But what about human rights? Has that concern, as many critics say, gone
to the wayside? No, it has not. But it has a much different place in the
Trump foreign policy.

President Trump begins with the premise that America is good. And, as a
democratic republic rooted in universal principles that align with
Christianity's principles of justice, he is starting from a good place.
America's democratic republic has not been perfect, but its founding
documents and citizens have managed to create and thus far sustain the
most just society the world has ever seen.

President Trump views his job as defender of America. He is her CEO and
bodyguard. He does speak of human rights and abuses, but he does not do
it to inspire. Since he does not have the gift of eloquence, it might
not be possible for him to do so anyway. When he speaks of human rights,
he does so in the course of pressuring regimes to change a specific
behavior. He uses public shame for a purpose---not to offer a moral
scolding but to exact an outcome. Recall the 2018 State of the Union,
when he outlined North Korea's many shameful abuses of its people, and
of American citizen Otto Warmbier. He did that for a purpose---to add
more pressure to the pressure campaign that was meant to compel North
Korea to negotiate a plan to dismantle its illicit nuclear program.

The Trump foreign policy does not beat the drums about human rights; no,
not when there are more countries that fall short of US standards of
just government than those that meet it[. President [Trump is
willing]{.mark} both [to]{.mark} make distinctions and [act boldly while
maintaining a]{.mark} far more [modest view about what the
U]{.mark}nited [St]{.mark}ates [is]{.mark} actually [able to achieve in
the domestic affairs of other nations]{.mark}, especially in the short
term. [Rather than reprimanding dictators for]{.mark} their
[abuses]{.mark} as the administration's own cause and even flirting with
the idea of toppling one dictator to replace him with another, the
[Trump]{.mark} foreign policy [seeks to make do with current
regimes]{.mark}, barring an existential threat from one. Instead, it
attempts to be that example, the Shining City on a Hill, and to
encourage reforms toward justice as it usefully can, as it works to care
first and foremost for its own citizens. Notably, [he takes]{.mark} the
imprisonment and [injury of Americans]{.mark} at the hands of dictators
deadly [seriously]{.mark} and does not view the same fate of
non-Americans as his primary concern.]{.underline}

The Trump foreign policy has done all of this imperfectly and boldly
while sometimes inducing cringes from those who agree in principle. Some
of the efforts have resulted in amazing successes, and some are still to
be determined (like the diplomatic effort to dismantle North Korea's
nuclear missile program). [President [Trump]{.mark} is leading a
[foreign policy]{.mark} that [is energetic, decisive, and even
disruptive]{.mark}. But [disruption was overdue]{.mark} after decades of
foreign policies that were more idealistic and often weakened American
strength, influence, and prosperity. Some of the consequences of the
decisions and actions [he has already]{.mark} made are yet to be seen
and fully felt, and they no doubt have [altered regional and even global
dynamics]{.mark}. And it's only been two years.]{.underline}

Washington's talking heads worked all night and into the morning,
discussing the potential damage from the U.S.-Russia summit. [Yet, over
the long term, [there will be no true fallout from]{.mark} President
[Trump's]{.mark} [badly chosen words at]{.mark} the end of his press
conference with thug-in-chief Vladimir [Putin]{.mark}.]{.underline}

While Trump clearly made a colossal mistake, throwing his intelligence
agencies under the bus while standing beside the man who ordered an
attack on our democracy, he likely will weather the storm --- at least
this time.

[Luckily for our president, [where America stands in the global pecking
order is on the rise]{.mark} --- and, looked at objectively without a
political lens, all [thanks to Trump's policies]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[For example, [NATO remains intact and is getting stronger, thanks to
growing military budgets]{.mark} --- something for which Trump can take.
Russia is a weak, declining power, with nothing more to offer the world
than oil and guns. [No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea, for now, [has been
tamed]{.mark}. The [U.S. economy is strong]{.mark}, our military might
is slowly being restored and will dominate the battlefield for decades
to come. That is all thanks to an administration that clearly has had
many challenges to overcome but has, on balance, delivered results at
home and abroad.]{.underline}

Trump clearly has the right policies. Yet, as showcased Monday, he can
undermine it all with shoot-from-the-hip comments that could prove
politically fatal if he is not careful. When he opens his mouth without
thinking through his actions, fawns over America's enemies, or goes on
Twitter in a rant-style rage, he chances undoing all of his success ---
and he must learn a lesson from Helsinki, or else.

Consider this: If you ignored (as I try to do) all of the president's
Twitter and press conference rants, Trump has a standard, even
Reagan-like foreign policy outlook, clearly demonstrated in his policies
towards America's greatest geopolitical rivals.

[First, consider his policy on Russia, where [he has pushed back harder
on Moscow's rogue antics than]{.mark} Barack [Obama]{.mark} ever did.
[Trump]{.mark} is [arming Ukraine, applying additional sanctions on
Moscow,]{.mark} and even attacked close Russian ally Syria --- even when
Moscow threatened repercussions would be forthcoming.]{.underline} If
you never read a Trump tweet, turned on the TV or logged on to Twitter,
and just looked at policy, you would think Trump was waging a new Cold
War on Putin.

[Next, there is Trump's action regarding China, a massive shift from any
previous U.S. president since the 1960s. America is slowly shifting its
strategy of what was engagement with the so-called Middle Kingdom to a
tough, near-containment style doctrine that has cast Beijing as its No.
1 geopolitical foe. [Trump has taken on China over trade --- something
that should have been done 10 years ago]{.mark} and is wildly popular
among mainstream Republicans and many sections of America's working
class, and even blue-collar Democrats.]{.underline} When you factor in
the administration's push to warm ties with Taiwan, Vietnam and other
nations that have a shared interest in limiting China's ability to
dominate Asia, along with a stronger military presence in the region, it
is clear that Trump means business.

[The [Trump Doctrine]{.mark}, to reemphasize power politics in U.S.
foreign policy, [is a]{.mark} [winning strategy]{.mark}.]{.underline}
What Trump must do now might be the hardest part for him, something
against all his instincts and against what made him successful: Let the
policies do the talking for him.

[For example, when he is at a press conference and he is asked about
[Russia's meddling]{.mark} in the 2016 election, he needs to talk about
what [his administration has done to ensure Moscow has been weakened and
pays a price for its actions]{.mark} --- and that America will ramp up
the pressure if Putin does not learn his lesson]{.underline}. He cannot
be triggered by just the mere notion that someone has doubts about his
electoral victory. Being the free world's leader demands that he allow
such attacks to roll off his back, or he will be forever punching at
ghosts that don't have to fight back --- and only hurting himself in the
process.

[AFTER A YEAR and a half in office, Donald Trump's foreign policy
appears poised for success, though some major challenges in approach and
execution remain. While still a work in progress, the [president's
approach]{.mark} already reflects some commendable and much needed
changes, [genuinely putting America first and making foes and
friends]{.mark} alike [take American positions more
seriously]{.mark}.]{.underline}

America's international conduct has become noticeably more muscular,
relying on a significant increase in the military budget and a
demonstrable willingness to use force. [This is [particularly true in
Syria]{.mark}; Trump's [red lines are more credible than
Obama's]{.mark}, and [when Trump threatens to use military force, few
are ready to gamble]{.mark} that the American president is
bluffing.]{.underline}

Indeed, when the president has decided that important U.S. interests are
at stake, he has been prepared to go further than his predecessor Barack
Obama. [[Limited]{.mark} but psychologically effective [air strikes
against Syria]{.mark}, [as well as]{.mark} the decision to supply
[Ukraine with Javelin anti-tank missiles]{.mark} (which Obama avoided
due to fears of escalating the conflict there), [show that Trump is
willing to use military force]{.mark} not only as a last resort, but [as
a legitimate]{.mark} and essential [tool of]{.mark} American [foreign
policy]{.mark}. This [offers]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
an important [advantage in dealing with adversaries like Iran
and]{.mark} [No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea. As a result, [each is less
certain that America will give up on its core]{.mark} objectives [if it
fails to get what it wants through]{.mark} economic and military
[pressure]{.mark}.]{.underline}

But there is a lot to worry about too. So far, the administration has
struggled to complement appropriate pressure with equally creative
diplomacy. Moreover, the president and other key players in his
administration often act and speaks inconsistently. Notwithstanding a
formal National Security Strategy released in December 2017, the
administration continues to lack a coherent strategic framework that
defines national security priorities. To be more precise, the
administration has yet to define American priorities in a serious
analytical manner and has acted as if the United States can escape hard
choices and the risks of potentially costly unintended consequences.

Paradoxically, while many governments increasingly appear to view the
United States as a formidable superpower that they cannot easily cross
or ignore, many of the same governments see the administration as
erratic, unable to evaluate situations objectively, and prone to
personalizing relations with foreign leaders and countries---even in
dealing with other major powers. To these governments, the United States
seems capricious and offers few tangible incentives for accommodating
American preferences. This is an obstacle for Trump in accomplishing his
international objectives.

It is fair to give the president credit for delivering, or working to
deliver, on many of his electoral promises, something that is reportedly
a source of pride for Trump. As a candidate, Donald Trump said that he
would take a tougher stance on illegal immigration, demand more
beneficial trade arrangements from other nations, downplay the struggle
against climate change, and avoid regime change and meddling in the
internal politics of other states.

[While there is still no sign of a Mexico-financed border wall and
Trump's vigorous calls for concessions from American trading partners
have yet to demonstrate significant results, the president has [stayed
on course despite the numerous domestic and international
obstacles]{.mark}. Trump has [forced the outside world to take him
seriously]{.mark}. Other nations, including major powers such as the
[E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion, [China, Russia]{.mark}, [and even
No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea [and Iran]{.mark}, have appeared ready to
[display some flexibility]{.mark}. In the case of Russia, while Obama's
sanctions succeeded in causing indignation among the Russian people, and
particularly among the elites, Trump's more [far-reaching
sanctions]{.mark}---zeroing in on key public companies and top
Putin-friendly tycoons---[are beginning to disturb Moscow and]{.mark} to
[curtail]{.mark} its earlier snide [dismissal]{.mark} of U.S. and
Western pressure. At a minimum, Trump's willingness to impose new
sanctions discourages Russia from risking escalation with the United
States in Syria or Ukraine.]{.underline}

One of the most intriguing aspects of the Trump campaign's foreign
policy rhetoric was its fresh and unorthodox attitude towards America's
national security priorities. Candidate Trump was not sophisticated
about international affairs and struggled to present well-formulated
alternatives to America's conventional foreign policy approaches. Yet he
did have a business leader's intuitive practical sense in looking at the
world as it relates to America's national interests. Throughout the
campaign, he raised valuable questions without necessarily offering
thoughtful answers about alternative national security strategies for
the United States. Trump started by questioning conventional assumptions
about America's allies and adversaries and seeing neither category as
wholly self-evident, unlike the establishment, whose cliches he refused
to repeat[. Instead, he asked what America's allies were doing for the
United States and what U.S. alliances cost.]{.underline} As far as
adversaries are concerned, he began asking some obvious but rare
questions about which countries present significant problems for the
United States and which pose lesser problems that might be amenable to
resolution.

[In thinking about national security, [Trump seemed to view]{.mark}
radical Islamic [terrorism]{.mark}---responsible for 9/11, the Boston
Marathon attack, and many other attacks in the United States and
Europe---[as the top threat]{.mark}. Focusing on that problem is neither
capricious nor inherently racist.]{.underline} Trump clearly saw trade
imbalances with China and many European nations as a major problem too.
Even free trade champions would not deny that Beijing was introducing
new protectionist measures denying U.S. companies market access parallel
to what Chinese companies enjoy in America. Questioning why prosperous
Europeans enjoying subsidized U.S. defense deserve trade advantages too
should not be considered offensive; it is a fact that average U.S.
tariffs on goods are just 2.4 percent when average eu and Canadian
tariffs are 3 and 3.1 percent, respectively. [But Trump will need to
pursue his trade policies in a more coherent fashion that avoids
gratuitously damaging relations with longtime allies---who are still
very important to U.S. security---and artificially inflaming tensions
with American adversaries.]{.underline} Simultaneous trade disputes with
Mexico, Canada, Europe and China would defy strategic logic.

After America's physical survival and economic prosperity, Trump appears
to see maintaining sovereignty over America's borders and preventing an
influx of illegal immigrants as the country's next most important
national interest. For Trump, this and a \$70 billion trade deficit in
2016 made U.S.-Mexico relations a top challenge and an area needing
game-changing corrections.

As a candidate, Trump did not include Russia on his list of the top
challenges to the United States, despite increasingly widespread
establishment perceptions of Russia as an adversary. With Russia's gdp
around 10 percent of America's and its conventional forces far from a
match for NATO, Trump had good reasons to wonder why a country that
Obama described as an economically-weak regional power should become an
organizing principle of America's security policy.

This raised an inevitable question about NATO: was it a necessary
instrument to protect American security or a Cold War--era organization
that had outlived its original purpose to contain Soviet expansionism?
If the Europeans were so afraid of Russia, why were they spending so
little on defense compared to the United States, and why were so few
European nations prepared to meet NATO's stated defense spending goal of
at least 2 percent of gdp? [Since [NATO was no longer relevant to the
fundamental challenges]{.mark} candidate Trump saw to America, was it a
sacred cow rather than a powerful vehicle to protect American interests?
Was America quietly being taken for a ride by European allies while
becoming increasingly enmeshed in European conflicts of little
importance to the United States?]{.underline}

George Washington counseled against steps that would "entangle our peace
and prosperity in the toils of European ambition, rivalship, interest,
humor, or caprice." [The fact that [America has a commitment to defend
NATO allies]{.mark} need not imply a parallel commitment to support
their every venture. [Europeans certainly feel no such obligation to
America,]{.mark} as demonstrated by their lack of support for America's
commitment to Israel, including at the United Nations. [Trump appeared
intuitively to see this asymmetry and to turn a skeptical ear
toward]{.mark} virtuous language that [obscured limited help for

assertions of superior values from governments building a supranational
bureaucracy that constrains businesses and limits freedoms.]{.underline}

[Contrary to what much of the media reported and many pundits opined,
[the]{.mark} late-February [Trump-Kim summit]{.mark} in Hanoi [did not
"collapse,"]{.mark} nor was it a "humiliation" for the president.134
[These are]{.mark} further [examples of instinctive bias against
Trump.]{.mark}]{.underline} Rather, like many summits before it, after
tough talks it did not end in accord between the two parties because
differences could not be reconciled.135 Although Trump seemed to place
too much confidence in his personal ability to sway Kim, and complex
negotiations between leaders is not the ideal way to reach agreement,
[[Trump rightly refused to]{.mark} accept the North Korean offer to
dismantle the Yongbyon nuclear weapons facility (three square miles and
three hundred buildings) in return for the United States'
[lift]{.mark}ing all [sanctions]{.mark} against
Pyongyang.]{.underline}136

[[This offer]{.mark} to dismantle Yongbyon was vague and [would]{.mark}
also [have left No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea [with]{.mark} all its
[intercontinental missiles]{.mark}, all the weapons-grade plutonium
already produced, [and]{.mark} all the nuclear devices it has stored;
allowed [the]{.mark} continued [production of nuclear weapons]{.mark};
kept its entire nuclear inventory secret; and not disclosed its secret
facilities to enrich uranium and perhaps plutonium.]{.underline}137 As
Susan Rice, Obama's former national security advisor, put it, "For the
United States to have agreed to lift all sanctions in the absence of
real and complete denuclearization would have been a tremendous
mistake."138

Where [the Trump-Kim exchanges go from here is unclear]{.underline},
although North Korea apparently began rebuilding major missile-test
facilities immediately after the Hanoi summit.139 If Pyongyang tests a
ballistic missile, a fundamental reevaluation of U.S. policy toward
North Korea will obviously be required. North Korea is highly unlikely
to give up its nuclear arsenal, which is the surest guarantee of the
continuation of the regime. Washington should finally come to this
conclusion and concentrate on an urgent effort to trade some North
Korean restraint in its nuclear weapons and missile programs for some
relief in sanctions. In addition, the president should not make any more
unilateral concessions, as he did when he permanently canceled
U.S.-South Korean major military exercises.

[**[Trump]{.mark}'s strategy at this writing** has [calmed the
situation]{.mark} and reinvigorated the negotiating track by having U.S.
and North Korean officials meet at the highest level for the first time
in history.]{.underline}140 He has addressed, at least temporarily, what
matters most to U.S. vital national interests---the suspension of North
Korea's nuclear and missile tests, whose systems directly threaten the
U.S. mainland. [[It appears unlikely]{.mark} that [this would have
happened without **Trump's**]{.mark} **dramatic if [unorthodox
approach]{.mark}**, and through his negotiation [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [is]{.mark} now [in a]{.mark} somewhat [better position
to reduce the threat from]{.mark} North Korean [nuclear weapons]{.mark}
and ballistic missiles than it was when he entered office. At a minimum,
[he has delayed]{.mark}]{.underline} the moment when a U.S. president
would have to either stand by while North Korea progressively expanded
its nuclear weapon and ballistic missile capabilities, or attack its
nuclear and missile sites, which could lead to [[a nuclear
war]{.underline}]{.mark} on the Korean Peninsula and beyond.

All the same, overall the president deserves a high grade for his
policies on China. [[His administration has taken the lead in]{.mark}
awakening the United States to [the]{.mark} growing [threat]{.mark} that
[China poses]{.mark} to U.S. vital national interests and democratic
values.]{.underline} Regarding the latter and in the context of Xi
Jinping's internal crackdown, [George Soros stressed at the January 2019
Davos conference, "China isn't the only authoritarian regime in the
world, but it's undoubtedly the wealthiest, strongest and most developed
in machine learning and artificial intelligence. This makes Xi Jinping
the most dangerous opponent]{.underline} of those who believe in the
concept of open society."73 Without the Trump administration's
persistent political push regarding the increasing dangers of Chinese
power, America could well have continued sleepwalking while Beijing
decisively drew large parts of Asia into its orbit and away from the
United States.

[Now [the challenge for the president]{.mark}]{.underline} and his
successors [[is]{.mark} to persuade Beijing, [through]{.mark} enhanced
U.S. [power projection, more able alliances, and]{.mark} adroit
[diplomacy]{.mark}, that [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates will grow
ever stronger in Asia and, with its allies and friends, [will]{.mark}
robustly [confront]{.mark} [destabilizing Chinese
actions.]{.mark}]{.underline} If Xi Jinping and his colleagues could be
brought to such a conclusion, [Washington and Beijing could then work to
create and sustain a new and [stable balance of power]{.mark} in Asia
and to [avoid the catastrophic]{.mark} outcomes that a **permanent
[confrontation]{.mark}** [between the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates

[[It is not easy to attempt a fair assessment of]{.mark} President
Donald J. [Trump's foreign policy.]{.mark}]{.underline} In part this is
because of circumstances, namely that we are just past the halfway mark
of his term, which began in January 2017. "Incomplete" is on one level
the only appropriate mark.

[But the difficulty in assessing this president also reflects the style
of his foreign policy, including the frequent recourse to social media,
the secrecy that has surrounded critical summits, the high turnover of
senior-level officials]{.underline}, and the gaps that often appear
between the positions of these aides and the president. It can be
difficult to keep up and to be confident as to just what foreign policy
is being implemented.

In this new Council Special Report, however, Henry A. Kissinger Senior
Fellow for U.S. Foreign Policy Robert D.
[[Blackwill]{.underline}]{.mark} attempts just such an assessment. [He
[goes about]{.mark} it the right way, [evaluating]{.mark} President
[Trump]{.mark}'s foreign policy [not against his]{.mark} and his
administration's [rhetoric but against]{.mark} its **impact on the [U.S.
national interest.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Blackwill examines President Trump's actions in important policy areas,
including ties with allies, relations with China and Russia, and
policies toward the Middle East, North Korea, Venezuela, trade, and
climate change. He then grades each of the president's major foreign
policies and offers an overall assessment of the quality of the Trump
administration's foreign policy halfway through its first term.

[Blackwill argues that [even though]{.mark} many of President Trump's
[actions have been impetuous]{.mark}]{.underline} and the president
oversees a chaotic and often dysfunctional policymaking process, some of
[[his **individual foreign policies** are better than]{.mark} his
[critics give]{.mark} him [credit]{.mark} for.]{.underline} Blackwill
points to what he sees as a much-needed toughening of U.S. policy toward
China, a justified U.S. withdrawal from Syria and disengagement from
Afghanistan, and closer relations with India, Israel, and Saudi Arabia.
[History teaches us, according to Blackwill, that "[flawed individuals
and policy processes]{.mark} sometimes [produce successful
results."]{.mark}]{.underline} Like Wagner's music, he argues, Trump's
foreign policy is better than it sounds.

[For some readers,]{.underline} I expect Blackwill's grades will be too
low, while for others, [his grades will not be low enough.]{.underline}
I agree with Blackwill that the president has been right to challenge
China on its actions in the trade realm, in what he has done to rally
regional and international support against the Nicolas Maduro regime in
Venezuela, and in cultivating closer ties with India. But I would give
President Trump a lower grade on how he has handled Iran, North Korea,
and Syria. In addition, it is hard to see what the Trump administration
has received in exchange for its uncritical embrace of Saudi Arabia and
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman or for moving the U.S. embassy in
Israel to Jerusalem.

But these [and other differences I have or others will have with
Ambassador Blackwill's assessments overlook the fundamental value of
[this rigorous study]{.mark} undertaken [by an experienced
scholar]{.mark}-practitioner. It is the sort of work that [is]{.mark}
all too [rare in **this politicized environment**]{.mark} we live in and
where 280 characters often substitute for **in-depth
analysis.**]{.underline} There is much of value to learn in the pages to
follow, and [[I urge readers to]{.mark} make their way through this
paper and [come to their own conclusions]{.mark} as to what grade the
forty-fifth president deserves so far for his foreign
policy.]{.underline}

#### [Ignore Trump's Rhetoric]{.underline} --- his foreign policy successes include North Korea, NATO, China, and Russia.

North Korea and NATO

[[On North Korea,]{.mark} where **[previous administrations stood
by]{.mark}** as [the]{.mark} communist [nation]{.mark} developed its
nuclear weapons program, top State Department officials say that Kim
Jong Un has, for the first time, [agreed to the]{.mark} \"dismantlement
and [destruction of No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea\'s plutonium and
uranium [enrichment]{.mark} facilities.\"]{.underline}

Politico says that \"some North Korea analysts are hailing it as a
significant sign of progress.\"

[[On NATO, Trump managed to get allies to]{.mark} do something that
previous presidents couldn\'t: get them to [boost]{.mark} their [defense
spending.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[NATO [Secretary-General]{.mark} Jens Stoltenberg [gave]{.mark} Trump
[credit for this turnaround]{.mark}]{.underline}, saying \"we see some
real money and some real results. And we see that [the clear message
from President Donald Trump is having an impact.\"]{.underline}

Progress on China

[Then there\'s **Trump\'s progress on China**]{.underline} --- another
festering problem that experts failed to resolve. As a result of his
willingness to risk an all-out trade war, [Politico notes, \"there\'s a
growing bipartisan consensus in Congress and beyond that [Beijing is
exploiting the West\'s trade rules]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}

Meanwhile, [National Public Radio, of all places, acknowledged that
Trump has arguably been tougher on Russia than his
predecessors]{.underline}, just as Trump repeatedly insisted.

Substance vs Rhetoric

[\"[When you actually **look at the substance**]{.mark} of what this
administration has done, **[not the rhetoric]{.mark}** but the
substance, [this administration has been]{.mark} much [tougher on
Russia]{.mark} than any in the post-Cold War era,\" Daniel Vajdich,

### They Say: "Democrat Foreign Policy Better"

#### Dem foreign policy can't counteract the threat of [North Korea and Iran]{.underline}.

What [[voters]{.mark} have been more likely to [hear]{.mark} is
reflexive [condemnation of whatever]{.mark} Mr. [Trump does]{.mark} or
does not do.]{.underline}

His meeting late last month with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at
the Demilitarized Zone is a case in point. Ms. Warren faulted Mr. Trump
for "exchanging love letters with a ruthless dictator." Senator Kamala
Harris admonished him to "take the North Korean nuclear threat and its
crimes against humanity seriously. " Julian Castro, a former secretary
of housing and urban development, said, "It is all show. It's all
symbolism. It is not substance."

[Such [criticisms are reasonable, but]{.mark} they are **[not
policy.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Mr. Biden has said he will refuse to deal
with Mr. Kim until North Korea takes some unspecified first step. [Most
Democratic [candidates have yet to put]{.mark} forward [comprehensive
proposals on how to deal with the **nuclear threat from
No**]{.mark}**rth [Ko]{.mark}rea.**]{.underline}

Virtually all of the candidates support a greater role for Congress in
deciding whether to initiate war and expressed alarm about the potential
of stumbling into military conflict with Iran. [[Many]{.mark} have
**[endorsed rejoining the Iran]{.mark} nuclear [deal]{.mark}** that Mr.
Trump abrogated, [without saying how they intend to tackle this complex
problem.]{.mark}]{.underline}

A typical answer came from Senator Amy Klobuchar, who said that, while
imperfect, "It was a good deal for that moment," and, "What I would do
is negotiate us back into that agreement, stand with our allies and not
give unlimited leverage to China and Russia, which was what he has
done." [[More detail is needed.]{.underline}]{.mark}

While there is a strong proclivity among the candidates to reduce the
nation's military commitments, with at least half saying they would
bring the troops home from Afghanistan, [nuance can make a
difference.]{.underline} "I believe we should bring back our troops from
Afghanistan but I also believe that we need to have a presence there" to
support the Afghan leaders and deter terrorists from returning, Senator
Harris told The Times.

[Asked the greatest threat facing America at their debate in June, there
was little consensus.]{.underline} One candidate, Gov. Jay Inslee of
Washington, identified Mr. Trump; others were more predictable, citing
Russia, China, nuclear weapons and climate change.

Support for Israel remains strong, but [differences in tone and emphasis
are noticeable.]{.underline} Asked by The Times whether Israel meets
international human rights standards, Beto O'Rourke said Israel
"attempts" to do so but, "I know that they could do a better job."
Senator Cory Booker noted that Mr. Trump "seems not to support this idea
of a two-state solution, which has had bipartisan commitment and
conviction over decades." Mr. Biden said the government needs to sustain
"our ironclad commitments" to Israel.

[It's significant that the [Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark} [want to
reassert]{.mark} American [leadership]{.mark} and that so many are
inclined to end the forever wars. For decades, Republicans portrayed
themselves as the party of security and international engagement; Mr.
[Trump]{.mark} has [called that into
question]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} By a margin of 57 percent to 40
percent, voters now disapprove of the president's handling of world
affairs, according to a study by the Center for American Progress.
[[That's]{.mark} a [fortuitous]{.mark} opening **[if the
Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s can make their case.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[Remember Sen. Tom Cotton's letter to Iran?]{.underline} These days, you
can bet that the leaders of Iran do.

The letter, sent in March 2015, was one of those events that seemed like
a major outrage at the time but now feels like such ancient history that
the letter might as well have been written on parchment. At the height
of the debate over the Obama administration's nuclear diplomacy with
Iran, the Arkansas senator organized a group of 47 Republican colleagues
to send a letter to the "leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran"
explaining "features of our Constitution ... which you should consider
seriously as negotiations progress." Noting that any deal would be
merely an "executive agreement between President Obama and Ayatollah
Khamenei" rather than a formal treaty ratified by Congress and that
Barack Obama would be leaving office in January 2017, the letter warned
that the next president would revoke it "with the stroke of a pen."

[Democrats were livid about what they saw as a Republican attempt to
sabotage ongoing diplomatic negotiations]{.underline}. It certainly was
that, [but]{.underline} the thing is, [Cotton was completely right: On
May 8, 2018, Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the deal the Obama
administration had negotiated and re-imposed sanctions]{.underline}
lifted as part of it. Tensions between the two countries have been
rising ever since.

The five other countries that were party to the deal and the European
Union are still committed to it, as is Iran, but just barely. This week,
Iranian nuclear officials announced that they had quadrupled the
country's uranium enrichment production, putting them on a path to
exceed limits set by the accord.

If the Iranian regime stays in compliance with the deal, it may be only
because they know Trump won't be in office forever, either. Most of the
Democratic candidates running for president in 2020 have promised to
rejoin the Iran deal, which would entail lifting the sanctions that
Trump has re-imposed. Ironically, Democrats have been borrowing from the
Republicans' old playbook with former Secretary of State John Kerry, who
spent years negotiating the original deal, meeting with his Iranian
counterparts in an attempt so salvage it. In both cases, critics of
these actions invoked the Logan Act, the oft-cited but never enforced
law barring U.S. citizens from conducting unauthorized negotiations with
foreign governments. "He told them to wait out the Trump
Administration!" an enraged Trump tweeted.

[[Waiting out]{.mark} the [Trump]{.mark} administration [is]{.mark} a
[popular idea]{.mark}]{.underline} these days. Susan Thornton, the
former acting assistant secretary of state, told a gathering in Shanghai
earlier this month that China should be patient amid the ongoing trade
war and not rush to resolve it, telling the audience, "If this skeptical
attitude towards talking diplomacy continues in this administration, you
might have to wait till another administration." The parties to the
Paris climate agreement may also be somewhat heartened that every major
Democratic candidate has pledged to keep the U.S. in the agreement. (The
U.S. will technically still be a party to the Paris agreement until
November 2020 at the earliest, despite Trump's withdrawal announcement
in 2017.)

[[This **isn't**]{.mark} a very [encouraging]{.mark} state of
affairs]{.underline}, and not only because there's a decent chance Trump
will be reelected in 2020. [If it becomes the norm that agreements
struck by a U.S. president will be kept only so long as that president's
party is in power, [why would any country ever sign a deal]{.mark} with
the U.S. ever [again?]{.mark}]{.underline} [If the entire disposition of
U.S. foreign policy transforms depending on whether a Democrat or a
Republican occupies the White House, [it will have]{.mark} a
[destabilizing impact]{.mark} on international relations **[long after
Trump]{.mark}** leaves office]{.underline}.

[Politics has never entirely stopped "at the water's edge."]{.underline}
Richard Nixon's campaign scuttled Vietnam peace talks by promising to
change the Lyndon Johnson administration's policies. The
Carter-to-Reagan transition was no doubt almost as whiplash-inducing for
foreign governments as the Obama-to-Trump transition. [But presidents of
both parties have, at the very least, shared a disposition toward
international alliances and broad policy objectives that contrasts with
domestic political divides]{.underline}. This hasn't always been for the
best---the bipartisan foreign policy consensus has gotten the U.S. into
a number of wars it should never have fought---but it has allowed for a
certain level of continuity that makes diplomacy possible.

[The exceptions to the rule are those occasions when the culture war
bleeds into foreign policy]{.underline}. One example is the Mexico City
Policy, known by opponents as the Global Gag Rule, a draconian rule
introduced by the Reagan administration requiring NGOs that receive U.S.
funding to certify they will not perform abortions or promote abortion
as a method of family planning. The policy was rescinded under Bill
Clinton, reintroduced under George W. Bush, rescinded under Obama, then
reintroduced and made even more restrictive under Trump. The policy is
bad enough on its own, restricting needed aid to many organizations
providing vital family planning and HIV/AIDS services. The fact that
these organizations don't even know what the U.S. funding policies will
be from year to year, and can't plan their activities accordingly, makes
the problem worse.

[In today's U.S. political climate, [all issues are becoming **culture
war**]{.mark} issues, and more and more official U.S. [policies
abroad]{.mark} are coming to resemble the Mexico City Policy---switches
to [be flipped **on or off** depending on]{.mark} which domestic
[constituency]{.mark} the [party]{.mark} in power [wants to appeal
to]{.mark}]{.underline}.

There traditionally has been less daylight between the parties on
foreign policy, and it comes up much less than domestic issues in
presidential campaigns, but ironically, partisanship may come to have
more of an impact on foreign policy: [In an era of congressional
gridlock, it's a rare area where the [president can act]{.mark}
relatively [unfettered]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even if Bernie Sanders were
to become president, it's unlikely he'd be able to get a controversial
domestic policy like Medicare for All passed by Congress. But he would
definitely be able to pursue a vastly different policy on Iran.

[This dynamic has only been getting more acute in recent
years]{.underline}. [The near impossibility of getting Republican
support meant that Obama had to carry out most of his signature
diplomatic achievements---the Iran deal, the Paris accord, the
normalization of relations with Cuba---via executive
action]{.underline}. [That also meant those achievements could be undone
by executive action]{.underline}.

Treaties, as defined by Article II of the Constitution, require a
two-thirds majority of the Senate for ratification, so they have become
almost unheard of. George W. Bush submitted more than 100 treaties to
the Senate for ratification during his time in office, roughly on par
with his 20th-century predecessors. Obama submitted just 38, only 15 of
which were ratified. Trump has submitted just two so far: an amendment
to an earlier fisheries agreement and an update to the North Atlantic
Treaty allowing North Macedonia to join NATO. (Trump wasn't too
enthusiastic about this.)

Meanwhile, Trump has pulled the U.S. out of negotiations for the planned
Trans-Pacific Partnership and the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
treaty with Russia. Even the Universal Postal Union hasn't been safe.

[Nearly all the Democratic presidential candidates, to the extent they
discuss foreign policy at all, emphasize the importance of rebuilding
international alliances]{.underline}. If any of them becomes president,
he or she would probably work to rejoin many of the deals and
institutions that Trump has pulled out of and reaffirm the U.S.
commitment to those, notably NATO, that Trump has simply trashed. [But
[it will be **immeasurably more difficult** for]{.mark} the next
[Dem]{.mark}ocratic [president to replicate even]{.mark} the
[**limited** diplomatic achievements]{.mark} of the Obama
years]{.underline}. [Why would the leader of any U.S. adversary want to
repeat the experience of Iran or Cuba by spending political capital on a
rapprochement with the U.S., only to see the offer humiliatingly
rescinded by the next president?]{.underline}

[The problem isn't just treaties and agreements]{.underline}. [The way
Americans view the world]{.underline}, and other countries, [is
increasingly polarized]{.underline}. [Polls show increasing divergences
between the parties in views on Mexico, Iran, Russia, Germany, Canada,
and other countries]{.underline}. Iran may not be particularly popular
on either side of the aisle, but prominent voices on Democratic foreign
policy, including Sanders' foreign policy adviser, have been arguing
that Saudi Arabia is viewed as worse. [Whether you think the Iranians or
the Saudis are a bigger threat to human rights and regional stability
may soon become an indicator of partisan loyalty]{.underline}.

On the flip side, while Americans are broadly supportive of Israel,
[there is an increasingly stark partisan divide in views of the Israeli
government and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict]{.underline}. This
shouldn't be all that surprising considering that few leaders have
inserted themselves into America's partisan warfare as consciously or
effectively as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. While he has
declared that "Israel should always remain a bipartisan issue,"
Netanyahu has effectively aligned himself with Republicans, at least
since the debate over the Iran deal. Mideast peace, too, is a culture
war issue now.

The downside of this is it has become politically easier for Democrats
to criticize Israeli policies---some in quite stark terms---but it's
hard to say the strategy hasn't paid off for Netanyahu or for Trump. The
U.S. administration has moved forward on a wish list of Israeli policy
demands such as scuttling the Iran deal, moving the U.S. Embassy to
Jerusalem, and recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.
[The effect all this will have on stability in the Middle East,
Palestinian human rights, or even Israel's own long-term interests are
another story]{.underline}.

[Other leaders may follow Netanyahu's lead by attempting to align
themselves with a U.S. political party rather than the U.S. as a
whole]{.underline}. Just look at Hungary's controversial right-wing
Prime Minister Viktor Oban, who was the first world leader to endorse
Trump's candidacy in 2016 and was subsequently feted by Trump in the
Oval Office last week ahead of crucial European Parliament elections,
despite both Bush and Obama previously giving him the cold shoulder.

[Countries may never be entirely neutral topics in each other's partisan
politics]{.underline}---the U.S. certainly hasn't always been. [But at
least the ideal state of affairs is that they're willing to conduct
business with whatever party is in power]{.underline}. [And that only
works if there's at least a certain level of continuity in foreign
policy outlook and strategic goals as well as a baseline willingness to
honor agreements signed by the previous administration]{.underline},
even if the new one doesn't like them very much. [If current trends
continue, America's [partisan divide will **continue to widen**]{.mark},
and foreign policy questions will increasingly be treated as culture war
fights between the parties]{.underline}.

that barring a significant unforeseen shock to the system, the [outcome
of 2020 is already set in stone]{.underline}?

The high levels [of [hyperpartisanship and polarization in the
electorate have profoundly affected the political behavior of Americans
and, by extension, made the outcome of our elections highly
predictable.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Always powerful, partisanship has become the be-all and end-all for
American voters. With these political dynamics, a person accused of
sexual misconduct against teenage girls and young women can run for and
win upward of 90 percent of his party's vote --- as the Republican Roy
Moore did, according to exit polls, in the special Senate election in
Alabama in 2017.

Yet a key aspect of polarization has been somewhat overlooked: negative
partisanship. Voters with this attitude are mobilized not by love of
their own party so much as by hatred of the opposition party. Negative
partisanship especially benefits the party that doesn't hold the
presidency, because out-party voters find themselves living in a world
where their political preferences are under constant assault, or at
least appear to be so.

For the midterms, I devised a new forecasting model informed partly by
this new paradigm of voter behavior. It was as accurate as the best in
the forecasting business, and my predictions were made months ahead of
the others. That's important, because it is already telling us what we
can expect from the 2020 election.

For the 2018 midterms, my model predicted a large partisan surge for
Democrats. I identified America's suburbs as ground zero for a political
realignment away from Republican House candidates. The realignment was
fueled by two things: One was conventional --- the movement of
disaffected independent, or swing, voters away from the president's
party, which has happened in every midterm election since 2006.

The other can be tracked to the mobilization of negative partisanship in
driving turnout from Democrats who usually sit out midterm elections. By
identifying Republican-held districts with both a reasonably competitive
partisan electorate and a large number of college-educated voters who
could form a Democratic turnout swell, I predicted --- in July 2018 ---
that negative partisanship would allow Democrats to pick up 42 House
seats and sweep "Reagan country" in Orange County, Calif. At first, my
model was an outlier, but by Election Day, the FiveThirtyEight "classic"
forecast, Sabato's Crystal Ball and the Cook Political Report all agreed
with my forecast.

Motivated by the threat posed by the Trump administration[, [casual
Democratic voters]{.mark}, especially college-educated women, [have been
activated since Mr. Trump's election and will remain activated]{.mark}
so long as the threat he presents to them remains.]{.underline} And the
complacent Democratic electorate of the 2010 and 2014 congressional
midterms as well as the 2016 presidential election is gone (for now). It
has been replaced by a galvanized Democratic electorate that will
produce the same structural advantage for Democrats that manifested in
the 2018 midterms.

The surge won't be uniform[. [Democrats will win big in more urban, more
diverse, better-educated and more liberal-friendly states]{.mark} and
will continue to lose ground in other states like Missouri]{.underline}.
Although Mr[. Trump may well win Ohio]{.underline} and perhaps even
Florida again[, it [is not likely he will carry Michigan, Wisconsin and
Pennsylvania in 2020]{.mark}]{.underline}. Look at the midterm
performance of statewide Democrats in those states. And his troubles
with swing voters, whom he won in 2016, will put Arizona, North Carolina
and perhaps even Georgia in play for Democrats and effectively remove
Virginia, Colorado, Nevada and New Hampshire from the list of swing
states.

In short, [[the 2020 presidential election is shaping up as a battle of
the bases, and the Democrats' base is simply bigger.]{.mark} When their
demographic advantage [combines with an enthusiasm advantage
and]{.mark}]{.underline} heightened [[party loyalty]{.mark} fueled by
negative partisanship, [they hold a significant structural
advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}. Turnout in 2018 was about 12 points
higher than 2014 turnout and higher than any midterm in decades. Midterm
turnout can sometimes trail presidential-election-year turnout by 20
points. It was just 10 points in 2018, when it hit nearly 50 percent,
versus 2016. It is not infeasible that turnout in 2020 will exceed 65
percent[. Presidential-cycle electorates are better for Democrats than
midterm electorates]{.underline} are, and the third-party share in 2018
was also at its lowest levels in decades. In congressional midterms, the
average third-party balloting rate in recent elections is about 3.5
percent; in 2018, it was just half that.

We'll spend the next 21 months captivated by an election whose outcome
may already be determined because of polarization and negative
partisanship. [Democrats have a clear path to recapturing the White
House]{.underline}. It is hard to imagine any other president facing
these conditions running for re-election. But needless to say, Mr. Trump
isn't just any other president.

He received his bachelor\'s degree from Stanford University and
master\'s degrees from the University of Chicago and the University of
California -- Berkeley.[[Recent polling puts President Trump behind his
Democratic rivals]{.mark}.]{.underline} While he dismisses them as fake
news, there may be a lesson to glean from historical presidential
polling.

[Major [polls]{.mark}]{.underline} taken in the late spring [[showed
President Trump trailing]{.mark} his top [Democratic]{.mark} challengers
[both nationwide and in key states]{.mark} where the 2020 election will
be decided. One recent]{.underline} Fox News [poll]{.underline}, for
example[, showed [Trump trailing prospective challengers Joe
Biden]{.mark} and Bernie Sanders [by 10]{.mark}]{.underline} and 9
percentage [points]{.underline}, respectively.

Weak polling numbers are not a new thing in the Trump presidency. In
2016, polls showed candidate Trump losing right up until the day he was
elected. (Cliffhanger wins in several swing states produced his
Electoral College majority, even as he lost the national popular vote by
nearly 2 percentage points.)

The president has long since made a habit of dismissing polls, or at
least those he doesn\'t like, as one more example of \"fake news.\"

The president\'s campaign manager has said Trump\'s numbers have
recovered since March and that his \"numbers have never been better,\"
although he has yet to release any numbers to back up that assertion.

Presidential perspective

Poor poll numbers are not unusual for presidents midway through a first
term. Three of the past four presidents who won a second term were
trailing prospective opponents 18 months before they were reelected.

As NPR\'s Mara Liasson has noted on Twitter, incumbents who have come
back from significant deficits include Ronald Reagan, who won in 49
states against Walter Mondale in 1984. Moreover, the last incumbent
president who lost his reelection bid (George H.W. Bush) did so after
having been far ahead of the field with 18 months to go.

So what is the value of a poll taken this far from Election Day? One
answer might be found in the examples Liasson cited.

[All three of these presidents --- Reagan, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama
--- had suffered substantial setbacks in the midterm elections during
their first term]{.underline}. Each was battling emboldened opponents in
Congress.

In June of the year preceding their reelection bids[, three of the four
were \"losing\" to either a specific opponent from the other party or a
generic nominee of the other party]{.underline}.

[But [all found ways to tack toward the center]{.mark}, accentuate the
positive side of their first term and renew their personal bond with the
voters who put them in office.]{.underline} All three wound up winning
--- Reagan in a historic landslide. Clinton and Obama were reelected
more narrowly but still had comfortable leads in the Electoral College.

So what happened to the one candidate Liasson cited who had been ahead
at a comparable point in time? The first President Bush, flush with
success after the quick collapse of the Iraqi army in the Persian Gulf
War, seemed almost guaranteed a second term when polls were conducted in
June 1991.

Partly as a result, Bush and his team underestimated the challenges and
challengers ahead. They were dismissive of intra-party rival Pat
Buchanan and independent H. Ross Perot, and untroubled by such upstarts
as Clinton, who was then the youthful governor of Arkansas. Worse yet,
the Bush team would be slow to react to the recession that overtook the
economy that fall.

Battered by Buchanan and Perot and the economy in the early months of
1992, Bush found himself beleaguered and forced to cover his
conservative flank. That led to moves such as his veto of the popular
Family and Medical Leave Act (which was almost enacted over his veto).
All this helped Clinton, who would win the three-way November election
against Bush and Perot with just 43% of the popular vote.

Led by the polls

So[, [early polls cannot \"call the race.\" But they can point a
candidacy in a particular direction]{.mark}, right or
wrong]{.underline}. They can lead to complacency, or they can offer
insight into the state of political opinion and the mix of national
sentiments.

Taken seriously, and taken in concert with other sources of
intelligence, early polls can act as a corrective for a presidency at
risk.

We can read today\'s polls, then, and ask why Trump is not doing better
in the midst of relative peace, low unemployment and interest rates, and
a soaring stock market. We can also observe that he loses these
hypothetical matchups despite overwhelming approval ratings among
Republicans.

Is [there something he is doing that keeps his base firm but prevents
its expansion]{.underline}? Are there ways the president can alter his
approach and keep his friends close, while alienating fewer potential
swing voters?

So far[, [his reelection strategy seems centered on his base and the
most provocative issues]{.mark} and behaviors that bind him to
it.]{.underline} These include his hard line on immigration, tough talk
on trade and bellicose attitude toward foreign adversaries --- as well
as his confrontational personal style.

Defenders say \"it\'s worked for him so far,\" and that is true. But if
the current polls mean anything, they mean that what has worked for him
has limits. The signals are there to be seen.

#### Trump on track to lose election now- demographic changes, set public opinion, and lack of a strong economic message proves

DR

On Tuesday night, in Orlando, Donald Trump formally launched his 2020
reëlection effort with another big rally. After what happened in 2016,
it behooves political analysts and commentators to approach the upcoming
campaign with caution. So I will put it no more strongly than this: with
sixteen and a half months to go, [the [President and his campaign staff
have reasons to be concerned]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The good news for Trump is that he retains a solid base of support, and
the demographic to which he has the strongest appeal---white Americans
who don't have a college degree---still represents a very big chunk of
the electorate. Plus, the unemployment rate is just 3.5 per cent, and
most Americans are optimistic about the economy. The bad news for the
Trump campaign is that [other [demographic groups seem to have turned
even more heavily against him, and a strong economy has failed to lift
his approval rating]{.mark}s]{.underline}. Moreover, [recent polls
suggest that he is in trouble in a number of battleground states,
including the three that were key to his victory last time:]{.underline}
Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.

You probably don't need reminding that, thanks to the vagaries of the
American political system, Trump won with just 46.1 per cent of the
national vote, and a favorability rating that was considerably lower. On
November 7, 2016, the day before the election, 37.5 per cent of American
voters had a favorable opinion of him, according to the Real Clear
Politics poll average, which suggests that either the polls were wrong
or large numbers of people voted for him despite not particularly liking
him. After his victory, his favorability rating rose to the low forties
during the transition, where it has largely stayed. The latest R.C.P.
poll average showed him with a favorability rating of 43.8 per cent,
which is pretty close to his latest job-approval rating---44.3 per cent
on Wednesday. It doesn't seem to matter what he does or says: these
numbers don't change much.

Among whites without a college degree, according to the network exit
poll, Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by more than two to one---sixty-six
per cent to twenty-nine per cent. This slice of the electorate
represents Trump's heartland, and according to the exit poll it
accounted for about a third of all voters in 2016. (Thirty-four per
cent, to be precise.) However, some political experts believe that
estimate is too low. In a 2017 study that drew on actual voter files,
national-opinion surveys, and their own post-election polling, John
Halpin and Ruy Teixeira, of the Center for American Progress, and Rob
Griffin, a political scientist at George Washington University,
concluded that forty-five per cent of the voters in 2016 were whites
without a college degree---eleven percentage points more than the figure
from the exit poll.

The more there are of this type of voter, the better Trump's chances. So
what about 2020? [Ongoing [demographic changes are steadily making the
country more diverse]{.mark}]{.underline}. But, in a 2018 analysis,
Griffin, Teixeira, and William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings
Institution, estimated that [next year whites without college degrees
will make up forty-four per cent of the electorate]{.underline}---just
slightly [less than in 2016]{.underline}. If this analysis is correct,
non-college whites will still be the biggest single voting bloc on the
basis of race and education. Plus, they are spread out across the
country. The "concentration of Democratic support in metropolitan areas
diffuses over-all demographic advantages and increases the chances that
large turnout and support from Trump's base, primarily white
noncollege-educated voters in more rural and working class states, can
once again lead to a narrow victory" in the Electoral College, Halpin
and Teixeira noted.

But if [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} has a potential [[pathway]{.mark}
back [to the White House]{.mark}, he also [has]{.mark} some very [big
obstacles in his way]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} beginning with the
fact that, even if white non-college voters did make up forty-four per
cent of the 2020 electorate, and he got two-thirds of their support
again, it would leave him at roughly thirty per cent of the over-all
vote. [To win, [he also has to attract the support of other
groups]{.mark}, such as whites with college degrees, Independents, and
Latinos]{.underline}. But the message of the 2018 midterms, and of
recent opinion polls, is that many people in these groups have had their
fill of him and want him gone. [[Outside of his base]{.mark}, he's just
not popular]{.underline}. And that is putting it mildly.

For example, according to the latest Fox News Poll, [Trump's [approval
rating among]{.mark} self-described [Independents]{.mark} [is thirty per
cent]{.mark}, among self-described "[moderates" it is thirty-two per
cent]{.mark}, and among suburban women it is thirty-three per cent. The
poll also provided direct evidence that people in these groups are
unwilling to overlook Trump's character flaws]{.underline}. In response
to the question "Do you think a politician can have low moral and
ethical standards and still be a good leader?" sixty-five per cent of
Independents said no, as did sixty-two per cent of moderates and
sixty-six per cent of suburban women.

Another problem for Trump is that, at least according to the polls,
[[the strong economy doesn't seem to be benefitting him]{.mark} very
much politically]{.underline}. As he arrived in Florida, a Quinnipiac
University poll indicated that fifty-four per cent of Floridians think
that they are better off than they were in 2016, and only twenty-three
per cent think they are worse off. But the same poll showed that
fifty-one per cent of Floridians disapprove of the job Trump is doing,
and just forty-four per cent approve.

Perhaps [[voters understand that the economy was already growing
steadily when Trump took office]{.mark}, and they don't give him much
credit for subsequent developments]{.underline}. [But there is also
[widespread skepticism about his economic policies, particularly
the]{.mark} highly regressive [2017 tax bill]{.mark}]{.underline} and
the tariffs on goods from China and other countries. In the Fox News
poll, thirty-three per cent of respondents said that they believe
tariffs help the economy, versus forty-five per cent who said that
tariffs hurt the economy. In another question, the pollsters also asked
people to say whether Trump's economic policies benefit everyone, no
one, or just certain groups. Thirty-one per cent of respondents said
that the policies benefit everyone; forty-eight per cent said that they
benefit people "with more money."

Interestingly, the (correct) belief that Trump's policies are targeted
at helping the well-to-do is widespread among his core demographic.
Thirty-two per cent of whites without a college degree said that his
policies benefit everyone; forty-four per cent said they benefitted
people with more money. On the basis of these polls, it seems like
Trump's tax bill didn't even fool his base.

The other challenge facing Trump is the electoral map. At this early
stage[, he is lagging behind the Democratic frontrunners in some of the
states he could not win without, such as Florida, Pennsylvania, and
Wisconsin]{.underline}. Public polls have been showing this trend for
months, and last week it emerged that the Trump campaign's own polls
have found the same thing. According to ABC News, internal polls showed
Joe Biden leading the President by fifty-five per cent to thirty-nine
per cent in Pennsylvania, and by fifty-one per cent to forty-one per
cent in Wisconsin.

Over the weekend, the Trump campaign dismissed these polls, which were
taken in March, as out of date, and fired several of its pollsters. "The
president's new polling is extraordinary and his numbers have never been
better," Brad Parscale, the campaign chairman, said in a statement.
Trump also weighed in. "Our polls show us leading in all 17 Swing
States," he said on Twitter. And yet, hours after he posted this tweet,
the Quinnipiac poll of Florida showed that, in head-to-head matches, he
would trail Joe Biden by nine points, trail Bernie Sanders by six
points, and trail Elizabeth Warren by four points.

A degree of skepticism is in order. Historically, head-to-head polls
taken this early haven't had much, if any, predictive value in
Presidential elections, an analysis at Five-Thirty-Eight pointed out. It
certainly seems likely that Trump's numbers in the battleground states
will improve as we get closer to the election: practically nobody in the
political world expects a Democrat to carry Florida by nine percentage
points. But how much movement will there be? [With opinions about Trump
already so firmly set on all sides, it isn't certain that prior
experience will provide much of a guide to this election.]{.underline}

Indeed, nothing is certain, except that there is a very long way to go,
and that the election will be bitterly fought. Buckle up.

["The [media is treating polls]{.mark} today with the same kind of
reliability [as they would]{.mark} have [in]{.mark} late October of the
[election year]{.mark},]{.underline}" Murray said. "The problem is,
these early horse-race polls don't tell us what they're portrayed as.
[They don't tell us how strong is Joe Biden relative to Sanders or
Kamala Harris against Trump. They don't tell us that because [the voters
don't really know the difference between]{.mark} Kamala [Harris
and]{.mark} Joe [Biden yet.]{.mark} They don't know what kind of general
election race they would run [and what]{.mark} kind of [attacks]{.mark}
will [come from Trump]{.mark}."]{.underline}

Most general election polls show Biden having the widest lead on Trump
in head-to-head match ups. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released last
week showed the former vice president leading Trump by 9 points, Sen.
Bernie Sanders beating Trump by 7, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren beating him
by 5 points.

Historically, [general election [polls more than a year out are about 11
points off]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis
of general election polls from 1944 to 2012.

Take for example late [1991, when Bill Clinton looked like toast,
trailing President Bush by 21 percentage points. Then, after the Gulf
War ended, the nation focused more on the economy. Bush's favorability
waned and Clinton won.]{.underline}

[Polls had Jimmy Carter beating Ronald Reagan by 16 points a year away
from the 1980 election. Reagan went on to win by 10 points.]{.underline}

Lyndon Johnson led Barry Goldwater by 50 percentage points, and went on
to beat him by 23. It was still a blowout, but less than half of the
margin those early polls predicted.

More recently, a year out from the 2016 election, [[a]{.mark} Quinnipiac
[poll had]{.mark} Ben [Carson beating]{.mark} Hillary [Clinton by 10
points]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"We think a country 200-plus years old, we've had all these elections,
we should be really good at predicting this stuff, and it turns out, we
don't have that many and we're not," Niebler, of Dickinson, said.

[[Polls]{.mark} also [tend to be]{.mark} conducted [national]{.mark}ly,
[whereas a]{.mark} presidential [race is determined]{.mark} state [by
state]{.mark}]{.underline}. State polls (who would win in Pennsylvania
between Biden and Trump, for instance) might offer slightly more insight
into a general election victory but should still be read with skepticism
this far out, said G. Terry Madonna, professor of public affairs and
director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin and
Marshall College. (A Quinnipiac poll released Thursday showed Biden as
the only Democrat who beats Trump in Ohio.)

A candidate's perceived electability isn't just based on polls. Biden
has positioned himself to voters as the person with the best chance to
take on Trump because of his background and politics. He touts his roots
in Scranton as a path to take back Pennsylvania for the Democrats. And
he appeals to Rust Belt voters in swing states that Trump won who
identify as "more moderate," which aligns with Biden's views.

But there are multiple strategies to beating Trump beyond Biden's,
Niebler said. And there's a long campaign to consider. Public opinion
can change rapidly based on debate performances and scrutiny on the
trail, and as the economy fluctuates.

"I think many Democrats now think they have three or four, if not more,
\[candidates\] who can beat Trump,\" Niebler said. ["[There's a]{.mark}
real [danger of reading things 15 months out]{.mark} and saying, 'The
path to the White House for Democrats looks like this.' Well, it might.
But only if you're this person."]{.underline}

[A lot of people are talking about hypothetical 2020 general election
polls]{.underline}, including the president of the United States.

A national Quinnipiac University poll released this week, for example,
showed Joe Biden with a 53-40 lead against President Trump. But it
wasn't just Biden --- all the Democratic contenders Quinnipiac included
in matchups with Trump were significantly ahead of the president: Bernie
Sanders 51-42, Kamala Harris 49-41, Elizabeth Warren 49-42, Cory Booker
47-42 and Pete Buttigieg 47-42. Meanwhile, in an interview with ABC

trailing the Democrats.1 "No, my polls show that I'm winning
everywhere," Trump said.

polls]{.mark} more than a year out and before the Democratic nominee has

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP is going to lose his re-election bid next
year---or so recent surveys appear to suggest. A poll conducted between
July 21st and 23rd on behalf of The Economist by YouGov, a pollster,
found that Mr Trump would lose the national popular vote to a Democratic
opponent by seven percentage points. A margin that large would be more
than enough for a Democratic candidate such as Joe Biden, the former
vice-president, or Elizabeth Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, to
coast to a landslide victory in the Electoral College. However, [[it is
currently more than 15 months before the election, and numbers released
this early cannot accurately predict how candidates will
perform.]{.underline}]{.mark}

According to number-crunching from Christopher Wlezien and Robert
Erikson, political scientists at the University of Texas and Columbia
University, [[pre-election polls make for poor predictors until the
close of summer in an election year]{.mark}, by which point both parties
have held their nominating conventions]{.underline}. In their book "The
2012 Campaign and the Timeline of Presidential Elections", they explain
that [[candidates' standing in the polls fails to account for]{.mark}
even [half of the variance]{.mark} in their eventual vote margins until
the spring before the election]{.underline}. At 330 days before the
contest---roughly [[December of the year before the election---polls
show]{.mark} virtually [no correlation to final election
outcome]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark}; today, 467 days before the 2020
election, they are even worse. [One could make better predictions by
flipping a coin than by looking at the polls.]{.underline}

Pollsters can blame a few factors for the errors in their early
estimates. First, [at this point in the campaign, [the eventual
candidates have not even been decided]{.mark}.]{.underline} It could be
that Joe Biden will win the Democrats' current primary contest, but such
a bet is no sure thing. How can voters be expected to know for whom they
will cast a ballot? It is also too early to know the eventual economic
and political conditions of the election[. By November 2020, [the
country could enter a recession]{.mark}, crushing Mr Trump's odds of
re-election. [Or]{.mark} America could [enter a new boom]{.mark}. It is
also too far in advance of the election for most voters to be paying
much attention to national politics.]{.underline}

Forecasters seeking to predict elections with ample lead time may turn
to information other than polling for more accuracy. Moody's Analytics,
a financial company, compiles economic data to use in predicting
election outcomes, for example. The best projections also make use of
economic indicators and the president's approval ratings---which, while
poll-based, are steadier and more frequently measured than the
head-to-head match-ups. Nonetheless, these methods are far from perfect.
Moody's forecasts predicted with 95% confidence that Hillary Clinton
would win the 2016 presidential election, and the best-known
political-science model that relies on so-called "fundamentals" such as
the economy and incumbency overshot Mr Trump's popular vote margin by
nearly three percentage points.

[[Other]{.underline}]{.mark} scholars are devising new [[approaches for
election prediction]{.underline}]{.mark}, but they [[are
untested]{.underline}]{.mark}. Rachel Bitecofer, who studies public
opinion at Christopher Newport University, has developed a method that
eschews poll-based models in favour of state-level demographic data,
such as how many white voters live in a state, and how far left or right
it typically leans in presidential contests. She predicts that Mr Trump
will lose his re-election bid in 2020. Her similarly-devised method
performed worse than poll-based methods in 2018. Ms Bitecofer's model
explained 70% of the variance in congressional races---simply using the
results from the last election would have predicted 95%---and it is
doubtful that the relationships between demographic factors such as age
and education and vote choice will remain constant from the mid-terms to
2020, as her model assumes. Her work also does not actually predict the
chance Mr Trump will win next year, only his chances in every state.
When asked for such a probability, Ms Bitecofer said it "wouldn't be
mathematically based". Still, she is confident that there is "little to
no chance" that Americans re-elect the president.

The 2016 election instilled in voters a deep scepticism of polling, but
is also served as a lesson to forecasters to be careful about how
confidently they convey their predictions[. [There is danger in
certainty]{.mark}. Two weeks before Mr Trump's election, James Comey,
then director of the FBI, made public an investigation into Hillary
Clinton]{.underline}. He later said he did so because he "was making
decisions in an environment where \[Ms\] Clinton was sure" to become the
next president, a sentiment he attributed to pre-election polling and
forecasting.

Given the uncertainty of predictions made far in advance, why are they
often taken seriously? The work of Nobel Prize-winning psychologist
Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (who would have also won the prize had
he been alive when Mr Kahneman received it) provides some insight. In
1993, in a book chapter titled "Probabilistic Reasoning", the two
authors stipulate that improperly-calibrated forecasts are often
accepted because they play on peoples' biases. When predictions favour
one side of the political aisle, as Ms Bitecofer's and Moody's currently
happen to do, people who support that side are more likely to believe
them.

Messrs Kahneman and Tversky found that [[people often give too little
weight to the underlying chance---the "prior probability]{.mark}"---of
an outcome, favoring instead the most recent snippets of hard data that
they see]{.underline}. In this case, the prior probability probably
favours Mr Trump more than many forecasters believe. Punters at
PredictIt, a website where users can wager on political events, give Mr
Trump a roughly 50-50 shot of victory next year. With an average job
approval of 43%, according to numbers crunched by the data-journalism
website FiveThirtyEight, he is only just short of turning out the
coalition that brought him to victory in 2016 with 46% of the vote. But
many Democratic partisans will succumb to the temptation to believe
soothing forecasts rather than confront such uncomfortable risks.

[[The very opacity of complex statistical models can also create an
illusion of validity]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly when they come
from a respected expert. But as George Box, a famous statistician, once
said, "[all models are wrong]{.underline}, but some are useful".
Forecasters and observers alike would do well to remember that.

Saudi Arabia has long been viewed as a valuable security partner for US
grand strategy in the Middle East. As such, it has received significant
military aid and equipment from the United States. However, [Saudi
Arabia's involvement in the conflict in Yemen, as well as the
extrajudicial killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, has
brought increased scrutiny to Riyadh's ethical standards and use of
American military equipment]{.underline}.

Overall Americans are somewhat divided on whether the US-Saudi
relationship is a positive or negative for US security. Half of
Americans (50%) say that relationship does more to weaken US national
security, while 45 percent say it does more to strengthen US national
security. Republicans are more positive on the relationship, with a
majority saying US-Saudi ties strengthen US security, while majorities
of Democrats and Independents say the relationship weakens US security.

Other poling shows that [even when Americans tend to consider the
Washington-Riyadh partnership a good thing, most still believe Saudi
Arabia should face penalties for its role in the Khashoggi
murder]{.underline}. [A 2018 Quinnipiac University poll found that 51
percent of Americans considered the US-Saudi alliance to be a good
thing]{.underline} versus 32 percent who said it is a bad thing (18% no

Friday started with the lights on early in National Security Adviser
John Bolton's office in the West Wing, with President Donald Trump
already starting to change his story about how close he came to ordering
a military strike on Iran. Here, [Friday ended with 21 Democratic
presidential candidates posing together onstage in matching T-shirts,
waving at a crowd nibbling on fried fish]{.underline}.

[What [Trump]{.mark} does in the coming days [could **reshape the world
order**, but]{.mark}]{.underline} so far, in the race to beat him, [the
[crisis has **barely made a ripple**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[This is just the latest weekend in a [primary]{.mark} campaign that's
started to [resemble]{.mark} a [rolling road show]{.mark}]{.underline},
with all the same candidates, political operatives, and reporters coming
together in a different spot around the country every few days. The
latest stop was the South Carolina capital, with Friday evening's "Blue
Palmetto" dinner, hosted by the state Democratic Party, and then
afterward, Jim Clyburn's "world famous fish fry," hosted annually by the
congressman. Yesterday, the candidates bounced between giving speeches
at the state Democratic Party convention and taking questions across the
street at a Planned Parenthood forum.

"We're bound by our Democratic process to do this," South Carolina
Democratic Party Chairman Trav Robertson told me, standing in the back
of the convention hall while the speakers revved up the crowd. "It
brings a renewed sense of urgency and seriousness to the situation."

Yet through all the official appearances and side events, [[few
candidates even said the word Iran]{.mark}, let alone explained what
they'd do about the tensions between the two countries beyond trying to
get Trump out of office]{.underline}. "No one knows what happens next,
including Donald Trump, but it's a dangerous time for America and for
the world," Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts told me on Friday
evening, after she'd popped into the World of Beer, a local bar, for a
brief speech to the Young Democrats of South Carolina. But the speech
she'd just given, and the rest of the primary campaign, hasn't been
about that, I pointed out to her, before she pushed back: "It is,
ultimately," Warren said. "It's about the chaos, and the fact that he
thinks this country should run for his own personal benefit, and hate
should be normalized." Warren added that she believes Trump has "marched
this country to the edge of war."

Most of the Democratic candidates seem to believe Trump himself wants
war---contrary to the president's repeated assertions---whether out of a
wag-the-dog reelection ploy or an overly aggressive foreign policy they
see as commander-in-chief playacting. "I think there's a chance that he
doesn't want to get into a war with Iran, if you take him by his words,
but the point here is, he's surrounded by people that may" want war,
Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota told me yesterday afternoon. "I don't
think he knows what he wants," said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New
York, raising her voice to be heard over the music at the World of Beer
after her own speech to the Young Democrats. New York City Mayor Bill de
Blasio, who is new to talking about anything related to foreign policy,
told me he sees "a purposeful march to war that some are trying to
engineer in the Republican Party.

["I fear deeply that]{.underline}, at some point, [Donald Trump will see
it as a helpful distraction," de Blasio added]{.underline}.

[The Democratic primary campaign's [focus]{.mark}]{.underline} so far,
[[on economics and]{.mark} the [character of]{.mark} the
[country]{.mark}, wouldn't look quite the same against the backdrop of
another Middle East war]{.underline}, and this one with a proto-nuclear
power that's been chanting "death to America" for 40 years. Aides to
several campaigns acknowledge that the circumstances could change within
days, anxious that by the time Democrats get to Miami for their debates
later this week, Trump or Tehran could overtake the questions---and,
more importantly, make the candidates seem irrelevant.

So far, [the [candidates haven't]{.mark} done much to [assert what they
believe on foreign policy]{.mark}]{.underline}. The only dedicated
speeches on the subject have come from Warren, back in the fall before
she even launched her campaign, and more recently from South Bend,
Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and the self-help author Marianne
Williamson.

#### Immigration and healthcare are most important to voters --- polls prove.

Accessed on 07-27-2019)

[Immigration has surpassed health care as the issue that voters see as
the most important facing the United States]{.underline}, according to a
new Harvard CAPS/Harris Poll survey released exclusively to The Hill.

[[Forty-two percent]{.mark} of registered voters [pointed to immigration
as the top issue]{.mark}]{.underline}, compared to [[38 percent]{.mark}
who [chose health care]{.mark}]{.underline}, the survey shows.

Older people were more likely to pick immigration as their top issue,
with 55 percent of voters 65 and older saying so. Only 25 percent of
voters aged 18-24 chose immigration as the most important issue.

[The [poll underscores]{.mark} just [how prominent]{.mark} a role
[immigration is]{.mark} poised to play [in]{.mark} the [2020]{.mark}
election cycle after health care had topped the concerns of
voters.]{.underline}

"For most of the last few years health care, a Democratic issue, has
been the most important issue, but as the full nature of the problems at
the border became evident, it has risen to the top issue in the
country," Mark Penn, the co-director of the Harvard CAPS/Harris Poll,
said. \"That's why Democrats in the Senate and House got together to
pass emergency relief legislation."

President Trump has hinged much of his political career on a hard-line
message of cracking down on unauthorized border crossings as well as
tightening legal immigration.

Democrats, on the other hand, are advocating for looser restrictions on
immigration, with many of the party's presidential candidates coming out
in favor of decriminalizing illegal border crossings.

[The trend toward immigration as the top issue also marks a shift away
from the political conversation in 2018, which hinged primarily on
health care.]{.underline}

Democrats running for Congress that year largely ran on a poll-tested
message of protecting the Affordable Care Act from Republican attempts
to dismantle it, as well as promises to expand coverage. The message was
seen as one of the factors that allowed Democrats to take over the
House.

More recently, however, the immigration debate has taken center stage.

Congress sent a \$4.6 billion humanitarian aid package to Trump's desk
last week following a bitter fight over protections for migrant children
in shelters.

And at the first round of Democratic presidential debates, candidates
staked out more liberal positions on immigration, embracing ideas like
decriminalizing border crossings and providing health insurance to
undocumented immigrants --- a show of how Trump's hard-line views have
pushed Democrats to the left in the immigration debate.

[[No other issue comes close]{.mark} to rivaling immigration and health
care [in the minds of]{.mark} U.S. [voters]{.mark}]{.underline},
according to the Harvard CAPS/Harris Poll survey. Terrorism and national
security came in third place with 23 percent, while jobs and the economy
placed fourth with 22 percent.

United Arab Emirates.

But [the survey]{.underline}, conducted by YouGov and commissioned by
the International Rescue Committee relief group, also [showed striking
nationwide ignorance about the conflict]{.underline}.

The three-year conflict in Yemen has been largely ignored by broadcast
media in favour of near 24-hour coverage of President Donald Trump's
foibles.

The war has claimed tens of thousands of lives and brought the Arab
world's poorest nation to the brink of widespread famine as winter
approaches and heating and cooking fuel prices spike, according to
relief organisations. But [of 1,000 Americans surveyed earlier this
month, a third said they had never even heard of the Yemen
war]{.underline}.

[[Among those who had an opinion]{.mark} on the conflict, **[75 per cent
opposed]{.mark} US [involvement]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 

"We've already made the argument that this conflict is morally and
strategically bankrupt,\" said [Amanda Catanzano, a senior director at
the Inter6national Rescue Committee]{.underline}. [\"]{.underline}But
[it's]{.underline} also [politically unpopular]{.underline}. [It doesn't
reflect the perspective of the American people.\"]{.underline}

The conflict has recently become a focus of policymakers in the west.
The [murder of Jamal [Khashoggi]{.mark} ]{.underline}last month, at the
hands Saudi agents tied to the office of Crown Prince Muhammad bin
Salman, [has [sparked]{.mark} a [debate about]{.mark} Riyadh's
increasingly [erratic leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Prince Salman, as defence minister, intervened in Yemen in 2015
after Houthi rebels seized the capital, Sanaa, and strengthened what had
been a loose alliance with Iran.

[Canada, Germany, Denmark, and Finland have already announced new
restrictions on arms exports to Saudi Arabia and the UAE]{.underline}.
The US, UK, and France have resisted such action.

On Monday, a coalition of charities including Oxfam and Save the
Children issued a joint statement demanding an ceasefire, the reopening
of ports to humanitarian and commercial goods, and for authorities to
resume paying the salaries of civil servants.

The coalition said: "If the government of Yemen, Saudi Arabia, the UAE,
Ansar Allah, and other parties to the conflict fail to take these steps,
and if the United States does not use all levers of pressure to compel
them to do so, responsibility for the deaths of many more Yemeni
civilians will lie not only with the parties to the conflict, but with
the United States as well."

US secretary of defence James Mattis has called for a ceasefire in Yemen
by the end of November ahead of peace talks in Sweden next month, and a
number of US lawmakers have spoken out against American involvement in
the conflict, but the war rages on. \"Rather than halting the fighting
we've seen continued intense clashes,\" said Ms Catanzano. "We are
anticipating some debate on Capitol Hill in the coming days about future
of US support for Saudi and UAE coalition. If the administration isn\'t
ready to move on it, we hope Congress can give it the time and attention
and debate it deserves."

In general, the war at the southern edge of the Arabian peninsula has
received scant coverage in the US press. Of those contacted in the
latest survey, [[**58 per cent** said they **did not know** the US sells
arms]{.mark} and provides intelligence [to the]{.mark} Saudi-led
[coalition]{.mark}]{.underline} and 64 per cent did not know about
civilian casualties.

Nearly [[30 per cent said they had **no opinion**]{.mark} on the
conflict]{.underline}. [Asked if US involvement in the Yemen war
advanced American interests, 42 per cent said they did not
know]{.underline}.

[The survey found **[82 per cent want congress to restrict weapons
transfers]{.mark}** and more than half want an end to all arms
sales]{.underline}.

[Wisconsin]{.underline} Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin said many
people in her state ["felt hopeful during the 2016 campaign that they
were being seen and heard" by Trump in a way that they didn't with
Clinton.]{.underline} But she argued that [Trump's tax overhaul gave
disproportionate benefits to upper earners and corporations, and that
his efforts to roll back health insurance subsidies mean ["working
people know they're getting the short end of the
stick."]{.mark}]{.underline}

Continued Struggles

[Trump's weakened standing reflects the region's continuing struggles.
Michigan is a case in point. Last fall, [General Motors]{.mark} Co.,
announced [plans to end production]{.mark}]{.underline} in two
southeastern Michigan auto plants. Data from the U.S. Commerce
Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis shows that [[personal income
growth]{.mark} in Michigan during Trump's presidency [is]{.mark} among
[the lowest]{.mark} of any state.]{.underline} And in recent weeks,
Trump started a Twitter attack on the United Auto Workers, blaming union
leaders for GM's decision to idle a plant in Lordstown, Ohio.

["The [optimism]{.mark} and excitement you heard [from workers two years
ago is]{.mark} mostly [gone]{.mark},"]{.underline} said Mark Gaffney,
former Michigan president of the AFL-CIO. "A lot of those people haven't
abandoned him. What you hear now is, 'He's being picked on by the
liberal media.' But [his [support is diminished]{.mark}."]{.underline}

Obama Voters

[One flashing warning for Trump is that voters who backed President
Barack Obama in 2012 and went for Trump in 2016 have begun to peel
away.]{.underline} In a March 21 poll, Optimus, a Republican
data-research firm conducting [an ongoing study of Michigan, Wisconsin
and Pennsylvania, found that [Obama-to-Trump voters were willing to
defect to]{.mark} an array of the [Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark} running
for the party's presidential nomination.]{.underline}

In Michigan, Trump was holding 84 percent of these voters; in
Pennsylvania between 70 percent and 79 percent, depending on his
Democratic opponent; and in Wisconsin, only about 66 percent. Though a
relatively small number, [Trump's margins were so narrow [he can't
afford much erosion.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"Our data shows [Obama-Trump voters beginning to move away from the
president]{.underline}," said Scott Tranter, a partner at Optimus.
["That, along with [the]{.mark} historic [turnout spike]{.mark} we saw
in 2018, [suggests a **tougher path for the president in these
states**]{.mark} where there are simply more Democratic-leaning voters
than Republican-leaning voters."]{.underline}

[[Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s have taken note]{.mark} of the president's
struggles and moved to exploit them. The Democratic super-PAC Priorities
USA has announced a \$100 million blitz focused on all three
states]{.underline} that will include a large digital advertising

#### Trump strategy to win 2020 won't work --- social and economic issues outweigh.

I\'ve been chronicling how leading Democrats have normalized
anti-Semitism by laundering it as mere criticism of Israel even when it
is not, and I would love a world in which Jewish Democrats took a stand.
Taking a step back and looking at the issue as a dispassionate political
analyst who is also quite familiar with the Jewish community, [I don\'t
see that happening on a mass scale in 2020, for a number of
reasons.]{.underline} Though I wouldn\'t discount a longer-term shift in
partisan loyalties.

Just by way of background, in this case, Trump was reacting to a Fox and
Friends appearance of Elizabeth Pipko, a former campaign staffer who is
now a spokesperson for a group called Jexodus, which bills itself as an
organization of millennials calling for Jews to leave the Democratic
Party over its anti-Israel policies and tepid response to anti-Semitism
in their own ranks.

[Trump tweeted: "\'Jewish people are leaving the Democratic
Party.]{.underline} We saw a lot of anti Israel policies start under the
Obama Administration, and it got worsts & worse. There is anti-Semitism
in the Democratic Party. They don't care about Israel or the Jewish
people.\' Elizabeth Pipko, Jexodus.\"

The reasons why Jews are unlikely to defect in large numbers come down
to some fundamentals, and some specifics about Trump and the issues at
stake in 2020.

[Though [Jews have generally voted Democratic]{.mark} for decades, their
support has varied.]{.underline} In 1980, for instance, Jimmy Carter
only beat Ronald Reagan 45 to 39. Whereas Barack Obama carried 78
percent of the Jewish vote in 2008, that number dropped to 69 percent in
2012 and 71 percent in 2016.

Over time, however, a few things have changed. [One is that surveys show
[many Jews are]{.mark} secular and [less connected with Israel]{.mark}
than previous generations.]{.underline} There is also a [raging debate
about the effects of the significant rise in intermarriage on Jewish
identity within the community.]{.underline} While I have many strong
opinions on these developments, for our purposes, it\'s [just important
to recognize that [a significant number of Jews don\'t consider]{.mark}
policies on Israel, or even [what a candidate means for Jews,]{.mark}
when voting]{.underline} --- let alone prioritize such considerations
over other issues on which they identify as liberal.

Also, a lot of the [[Jews who do consider]{.mark} a candidate\'s
[policies on Israel]{.mark} when voting [are already]{.mark} voting
[Republican]{.mark}]{.underline}, and many have shifted in recent
election cycles. The drop-off in support for Democrats among Jews, which
ranged from 76 to 80 percent from 1992 to 2008, to the 69 percent and 71
percent in 2012 and 2016, no doubt is already reflective of the
anti-Israel turn of Democrats that occurred under Obama. In a sense,
we\'ve already gone through a mini Jewish exodus. It\'s just that those
who already changed affinities represented the low-hanging fruit for
Republicans, and now they\'ll start to run into more resistance among
Jews with stronger ties to Democrats.

Viewed on its own, the rise of the anti-Semitic Left should still be
expected to increase defections, particularly among older, moderate
Democrats. [In a normal election year, with a more normal Republican
candidate, I\'d be more open to the idea that we\'d see a large-scale
shift in partisan loyalty.]{.underline}

But [[Trump]{.mark} is not a normal candidate.]{.underline} [The
[populist takeover of the]{.mark} Republican [Party is frightening
to]{.mark} many American [Jews]{.mark},]{.underline} as is Trump\'s
nationalist rhetoric. [[A Democratic Jew]{.underline}]{.mark} who is
turned off by what\'s happening to his party, [[is **likely to see Trump
as just as**]{.mark} **[prejudiced]{.mark} if not much more so than
Democrats**]{.underline}. [The fact that he\'s been the most pro-Israel
president ever may not factor much into their
consideration.]{.underline} What\'s more, [[there are]{.mark} a whole
host of [economic and social issues]{.mark} on [which]{.mark} most [Jews
identify as liberal]{.mark}]{.underline}. So for many Jews, they\'ll see
a choice of a Democratic Party that has become overly tolerant of
anti-Semitism, but who they otherwise largely agree with, and a
Republican Party with whom they largely disagree, who is led by somebody
they see as emboldening bigotry. [They are likely to grasp on to any
reassuring statement by a Democratic presidential candidate to avoid
having to cast a vote for Trump.]{.underline}

If nothing else, there may be one reason why [Jewish Democrats won\'t
defect in large numbers]{.underline}, and that\'s [[R]{.mark}uth
[B]{.mark}ader [G]{.mark}insburg]{.underline}. [[If Trump were
re-elected]{.mark}, [those who favor liberal policies would]{.mark} have
to [pray she could hang on until she was]{.mark} nearly [92]{.mark}
years old [to ensure she\'d be replaced by another liberal]{.mark} vote
on the Supreme Court.]{.underline} Those are pretty high stakes.

(CNN)President Donald Trump told the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las
Vegas Saturday that Democrats \"are advancing by far the most extreme,
anti-Semitic agenda in history.\"

In his ongoing effort to win over a bigger percentage of the American
Jewish vote in 2020, [the president highlighted his support for Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and criticized Congresswoman Ilhan
Omar in asking American Jews to support the GOP.]{.underline}

[The strategy won\'t work.]{.underline} Traditionally, [solid
[majorities of American Jews]{.mark} have [voted for Democratic]{.mark}
presidential [candidates]{.mark}.]{.underline} The only Republicans who
made some progress against this trend were [Ronald Reagan, with
39%]{.underline} of the Jewish vote in 1980, [and Mitt Romney, with
30%]{.underline} in 2012. Normally, the numbers look more like they did
in 2016 \-- when Hillary [[Clinton won 71%]{.mark} of the Jewish vote
and Trump got 23%,]{.underline} despite his efforts to use Israel as a
wedge issue.

In 2019, the numbers don\'t look good for Trump. According to Gallup[,
[71% of]{.mark} Jewish [respondents disapprove of the
president]{.mark}.]{.underline} In 2018, only 16% of American Jews
identified as Republicans. [[In the]{.mark} 2018 [midterms]{.mark}, [79%
of]{.mark} American Jewish [voters supported Democratic
candidates.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In other words, what the Conservative Political Action Conference has
called \"Jexodus\" isn\'t likely to happen.

Most [American Jewish [voters remain liberal]{.mark}]{.underline}. They
[don\'t support the reactionary agenda that President Trump has
championed]{.underline}. For instance, a sizable majority of American
Jews [hold liberal views [about immigration]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a
community that has spent much of its history seeking safe harbor and
fleeing persecution \-- a history that Jews will be talking about in
their homes over the upcoming Passover seders \-- they are not on board
with the President\'s efforts to build border walls and shut down the
asylum seekers.

### 2AC --- Trump Bad for North Korea

#### Trump North Korea Nuclear negotiations fail- all spectacle no action

both domestic and foreign news. "Trump's North Korea spectacle shows
he'd do anything, even undercut America, for attention?" 7/1/19

President Donald Trump loves big foreign policy events that draw the
nation's attention to --- well, President Donald Trump.

He went to London recently for the spectacle of dining with the queen,
ignoring the fact that he could have no meaningful discussions with her
government, which is in a state of transition, if not outright
paralysis. He also savors his meetings with Russian President Vladimir
Putin because the outrage they draw merely amps up the attention. But
[[nothing is like his approach to North Korea, where]{.mark} he'll
apparently [do anything]{.mark}, potentially even undermining America\'s
interests, [for the coverage it brings]{.mark}.]{.underline}

As the result of a tweet, which seems to be the foundation of a lot of
his on-the-go policymaking, [Trump met with North Korean dictator Kim
Jong Un on Sunday to announce the reopening of nuclear
talks]{.underline}.

To Trump, the get-together was a grand spectacle. Not only has he
already become the first U.S. president to meet with a North Korean
leader, he did so this time on North Korean soil, which is also a first.
But he has been down this road before with little in the way of results.
When Trump first met with Kim, in Singapore a year ago, he also drew the
world's attention. Then after a second meeting in Vietnam in February,
the talks broke off. Now he's at it again.

[There's [more here than self-promotion,]{.mark} though. [In]{.mark}
constantly [providing a stage for Kim, Trump is giving him
legitimacy]{.mark} and global standing that he most assuredly does not
deserve.]{.underline}

Making matters worse, [[Trump is]{.underline},]{.mark} according to The
New York Times, considering [[recognizing North Korea as a nuclear
power]{.mark} and merely asking for it to freeze its
arsenal]{.underline}, rather than giving it up. That's a step back from
where Kim was last year, when he promised to denuclearize.

[Not that it is likely Kim would follow through with either. [North
Korea has a long history of reneging on pledges to eliminate or freeze
its nuclear weapons progr]{.mark}]{.underline}[am]{.mark}. These pledges
go back to 1985, when it joined a nuclear nonproliferation treaty, and
1992, when North Korea and South Korea signed a pact to denuclearize the
peninsula. In 1994, it negotiated a deal with former President Jimmy
Carter to freeze its program.

[[To give Kim so much upfront now,]{.mark} in hopes that he will reform
his ways[, is unwise]{.mark}. Other rogue nations will be encouraged to
follow suit, developing their own nuclear arsenals]{.underline} and
forcing their way onto the U.S. president's agenda.

Indeed, Iranian leaders, who signed a deal to freeze their nuclear
program in 2015, have to see the way their nation is being treated even
as Trump coddles North Korea. Making a nuclear deal without weapons in
hand has left Iran vulnerable to renewed sanctions from an
administration hellbent on blowing up the agreement. On Monday, Iran's
foreign minister announced that his country had exceeded

Now, instead of one nuclear headache in North Korea, Trump\'s diplomacy
has resuscitated a second, making each more difficult to address. So
[far, [Trump\'s diplomatic moves]{.mark} in]{.underline} Iran and [North
Korea have shown great success in focusing international attention on
the White House --- but they [show little sign of tangible nuclear
progress.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The second summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean
leader Kim Jong Un will be a decisive moment[. [Another meeting that

denuclearization steps [and more front-loading of]{.mark} strategically
[important U.S. concessions will botch any chance of rolling back
Pyongyang's nuclear weapons]{.mark} capability]{.underline}, which has
advanced to unprecedented levels.

[[That will force the world to live permanently with a regime that has
yet to learn the basics of being a responsible nuclear state]{.mark} and
continues to violate human rights. T]{.underline}he Vietnam summit this
month will determine whether real denuclearization of North Korea is
possible ever, and how much Washington is willing to pay for it, while
ensuring the regime's survival and the country's prosperity.

[The U.S. negotiating team knows what constitutes a good deal, but
[there is a serious risk of Trump ad-libbing his way into a bad
deal]{.mark},]{.underline} as he did in Singapore in June 2018, [by
[relinquishing vital bargaining chips that disadvantage U.S. interests
and Asian allies' security]{.mark}.]{.underline} There, [Trump announced
in his post-summit press conference, without Seoul or his
administration's awareness, that annual and defensive U.S.-South Korea
joint military exercises]{.underline} (which he called "war games" and
"provocative," echoing North Korea's descriptions of them[) would be
halted]{.underline}. The worst-case scenario, for South Korea in
particular, would be if Kim tricks Trump into believing (inaccurately)
that nuclear weapons or intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs)
could be traded for U.S. troops, despite his administration's efforts to
restrain him from such unscripted deals with serious consequences for
the security and stability of the region.

The [Singapore joint statement expressed good intentions---but it [was
not a real agreement that obligated Pyongyang or held it accountable to
taking concrete steps toward denuclearization]{.mark}]{.underline}. For
North Korea, that meant nuclear business as usual last year despite the
historic first summit. This is why a real nuclear deal must be struck
sooner rather than later.

In Hanoi, the first order of business for Trump and Kim is to finally
agree on what "denuclearization" and "peace" mean. In Hanoi, the first
order of business for Trump and Kim is to finally agree on what
"denuclearization" and "peace" mean. Washington sees denuclearization as
the total elimination of all nuclear weapons, parts, materials,
facilities, and delivery systems (ballistic missiles) in North Korea.
Pyongyang, on the other hand, sees it as including the removal of U.S.
strategic assets and nuclear- and nuclear-capable weapons and the
eventual elimination of the U.S. military presence and influence on and
around the Korean Peninsula.

For North Korea, an end to the U.S. presence also overlaps with its
definition of peace. In contrast, the United States defines peace as the
end to hostilities with the North but maintaining a strong alliance with
the South and some military presence on the Korean Peninsula. Similarly,
most, if not all, bargaining chips will need to be mutually defined,
from scientific concessions such as what happens to the Yongbyon nuclear
facility to less sensitive concessions such as liaison offices.

[Equally urgent is an agreement on a comprehensive
denuclearization-peace road map. Outlining each trade-off with
timetables all the way to zero nuclear weapons]{.underline} and the
establishment of a peace regime would make for a truly unprecedented
deal. Whether the job can be completed in practice by its target
deadline is a separate matter. But this road map would provide each side
with predictability and place all outstanding issues in a framework that
North Korea can understand. [The North Korea problem is not solely a
nuclear issue but one that is entangled in many complex regional
issues]{.underline}.The North Korea problem is not solely a nuclear

[[North Korea test-fired short-range ballistic
missiles]{.underline}]{.mark} in early May 2019, marking the country\'s
first missile tests in 18 months. U.S. President [Donald [Trump is
downplaying the tests\' importance]{.mark}, refusing to call them a
violation of U.N. Security Council]{.underline} resolutions that ban
North Korea from taking part in ballistic missile activities.

[[This may]{.mark} be intended to [indicate U.S. commitment to
diplomacy]{.mark} with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, [but it carries
significant risks by allowing North Korea to achieve strategic and
political gains]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

The U.S. president said he was not bothered by the missile tests because
they did not violate North Korea\'s promise to stop testing nuclear
weapons or long-range missiles that could reach the U.S. mainland. With
this statement, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. [[president
has]{.mark}---intentionally or not---[sent a signal to North Korea that
it can continue conducting short-range missile tests and keep collecting
the data needed to improve such weapons]{.mark}. This is destabilizing
for the region.]{.underline}

[[Allowing these tests to continue gives North Korea the opportunity to
perfect the new type of missile]{.mark} that it tested for the first
time on May 4th]{.underline}. [The missile]{.underline}, which resembles
the Russian Iskander short-range ballistic missile, [can fly at a low
trajectory while changing its flight path. That kind of maneuverability
could compromise missile defense systems in South Korea, threatening
citizens and U.S. troops there.]{.underline}

North Korea, which has already hinted that it may carry out more weapons
tests, might also be tempted to see what more it can get away with
before the United States reacts. [[This could complicate diplomacy---if
North Korea returns to testing missiles with longer ranges,]{.mark} the
United States might be less willing to return to the negotiating
table.]{.underline}

North Korea also might try to exploit differences between the United
States and its ally Japan, which are likely to widen if missile tests
continue. Unlike Trump, Japan\'s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe insists that
these tests were a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions. After
meeting with Trump in Tokyo in late May, Abe chose to emphasize Japan\'s
solidarity with the United States and said he supported Trump\'s
diplomacy with North Korea. But Abe could face pressure to change that
position if North Korea continues testing missiles that threaten Japan.

[More broadly, the U.S. silence allows Pyongyang\'s own narrative about
the tests to continue without correction.]{.underline} In state media,
North Korea is justifying the missile tests as a defensive drill in
response to joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises, as well as a U.S.
test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile in California in
May. Pyongyang is also defending the tests by saying that the U.N.
Security Council resolutions that ban them are unlawful. Not countering
such narratives sends the wrong message to North Korea.

[[The United States may be avoiding an immediate confrontation with
North Korea, but this will do nothing to narrow the gap between the two
countries\' positions on denuclearization]{.underline}]{.mark}. At their
summit in Hanoi in February, Trump urged Kim to give up all aspects of
his country\'s nuclear program in exchange for relief from economic
sanctions. Kim refused.

It is unclear how much time remains for diplomacy. North Korea has
repeatedly signaled that the United States needs to soften its
full-and-immediate denuclearization stance if talks are to make
progress. Kim has set an end-of-year deadline for that to happen. The
missile tests were likely intended to pressure the United States to
moderate that position---and perhaps serve as a warning about how
tensions would increase should the deadline lapse without progress.
Still, Trump maintains that he is in no rush.

[Downplaying the missile tests may be a way for the United States to
keep the dialogue going. But for North Korea, it is an opportunity to
improve an arsenal that already threatens U.S. troops and allies in the
region.]{.underline} If North Korea starts testing missiles with a
longer range, it could get harder for the United States to return to
talks, risking the end of the diplomacy between the two countries that
began in 2018.

[The distance from hubris to delusion is short and]{.underline} the
administration of U.S. President Donald [Trump is bent on covering

and long-lasting bilateral relationship rests on a history of shared
interests and values that embody common expectations, reciprocity and
equivalence of benefits across different domains, rather than equal
benefits in every single sector individually.

Conversely, absent a solid body of shared histories and memories to
provide ballast, [[minor irritants can **derail** a
relationship]{.underline}]{.mark}. The bilateral relationship between
the United States and India, since the latter's independence in 1947,
had more downs than ups during the Cold War but has since been on a
gradual upswing. It was put on a steeply upward trajectory with the
signing of the bilateral civil nuclear cooperation deal in 2005.

Having been denied an entry visa for the U.S. for many years despite
being the elected head of a state government, on becoming prime minister
in 2014 Narendra Modi set aside personal hurts from the slight and made
a strategic decision to invest in the U.S. as India's most important
relationship. That has helped create important constituencies in the
U.S. Congress, political parties, bureaucracy, military and private
sector, contributing to deeper India-U.S. ties. The Indian diaspora in
the U.S. also plays key bridge-building roles.

However, [[because it lacks]{.mark} the [historical ballast of]{.mark}

coherent U.S. policy would accept some trade or technology costs as the
price of sustaining strategic partnerships with Japan, South Korea and
India]{.underline}. [The combination of geography, demographics,
military power and political weight gives India multiple roles in
safeguarding sea lanes, dampening Islamic militancy, combating terrorism
and taking the lead in disaster relief operations around the Indian
Ocean as after the Boxing Day tsunami in 2004]{.underline}. On Jan. 18,
2018, admirals from Australia, India, Japan and the U.S. sat together on
stage at the high-profile annual Raisina Dialogue in New Delhi,
symbolizing the shared strategic assessment among the four democracies
that China had become a disruptive force in the Indo-Pacific.

[The India-U.S. relationship is asymmetric]{.underline}. The U.S. is a
multidimensional actor across the military, diplomatic, economic and
financial global landscape. India is still struggling to boost its
economic and military power. [While the U.S. has a global train of
interests, India has a distinctive mix of regional interests at its
specific geographical crossroads]{.underline}.

For example, [India is keen to build Iran's Chabahar port as a route
connecting it to Afghanistan, bypassing Pakistan and linking it to
Central Asia]{.underline} and Eurasia. Chabahar would also act as a
riposte to the China-Pakistan joint venture to build Gwadar port. [By
basing its Iran policy solely on priorities in the Middle
East]{.underline} and threatening to punish any country that crosses
that policy, [the U.S. introduces yet another element of strategic
incoherence]{.underline} vis-a-vis China, India and Pakistan. India is
too large and in the pursuit of its regional interests, India's pride
and self-belief will not permit it to be a mere vassal state of any
external power, whether benign or malevolent.

A Times of India editorial urged Washington to make up its mind on
whether to deal with India as an ally or a "frenemy." Earlier, in
February Washington broke from its traditional neutrality to side openly
with India's narrative on a militant attack in Kashmir and retaliatory
missile strikes on Balakot. This was followed by the successful pressure
on China to lift its hold on designating Pakistan-based Masood Azhar as
a global terrorist.

But [[in recent weeks]{.mark} the [Trump]{.mark} administration
[has]{.mark}:]{.underline}

[[Leaned on]{.mark} India to [cancel]{.mark} its [S-400 missile
defense]{.mark} system from Russia [on pain of]{.mark} triggering U.S.
[sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline} under the Countering America's
Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).

[[Threatened to curb H-1B]{.mark} visas for Indians working in the
U.S.]{.underline}

[Urged India not to choose Huawei's 5G telecoms technology]{.underline}.

[[Terminated]{.mark} India's [sanction waivers]{.mark} for importing oil
from Iran and beneficiary status under the Generalized System of
Preferences]{.underline} (GSP) [program, affecting 12 percent of India's
exports to the U.S.]{.underline}

[Denounced India's retaliatory trade tariffs as
unacceptable]{.underline}.

[[Demanded]{.mark} further liberalization of Indian import and [market
access]{.mark} rules]{.underline}, for example on agricultural goods,
pharmaceutical products and big data tech firms.

Many U.S. complaints are legitimate and some demands are in India's
economic self-interest. Nonetheless, [the [public articulation]{.mark}
of U.S. grievances and threats will [make it **harder** for]{.mark} any
[Indian government to be seen kowtowing to Washington]{.mark}'s
demands[, fuel]{.mark} the latent but ever-present
[**anti-Americanism**, and reverse]{.mark} the carefully nurtured and
still [**fragile** pro-American sentiment]{.mark} of the last two
decades]{.underline}.

[[India **cannot** become]{.mark} an [Asian counterweight to China
if]{.mark} its [economy is weakened]{.mark}]{.underline}. [A
[transactional approach that weaponizes tariffs]{.mark}, trade and
dollar dominance [will compel]{.mark} the [Modi]{.mark} government [to
evaluate **other options**]{.mark}]{.underline}. During U.S. Secretary
of State Mike Pompeo's recent visit, new [Foreign Minister S.
Jaishankar]{.underline} --- a consummate professional diplomat who has
served as ambassador to China and the U.S. --- gently [noted that India
would decide its policy based on its own assessments of national
interests]{.underline}.

[This was diplomatic code for hinting that the S-400 purchase will
proceed]{.underline}. [Retaliatory CAATSA sanctions]{.underline} in turn
[could imperil several multibillion dollar purchases of U.S. military
hardware]{.underline} over the coming years[: a lose-lose
outcome]{.underline} at odds with Trump's pride in win-win solutions.
[There has been some pushback in Congress against the administration's
attempt to coerce India into complying with U.S. demands instead of
treating it as a strategic partner]{.underline}. But in the meantime,
[the [post]{.mark} of assistant secretary for South Asia, the nodal
agency [for coordinating India policy, remains **unfilled**]{.mark} deep
into Trump's third year]{.underline}, and there is no India champion in
the administration after the departure of former Defense Secretary Jim
Mattis.

[Tactical transactionalism via ad hoc responses to sanctions, tariffs
and technology denial is not going to be a long-lasting substitute for
strategic coherence in India's U.S. policy]{.underline}. Encouragingly,
Jaishankar and Pompeo concluded their meeting June 26 by noting that
"great friends" can disagree, "issues" arise in any trading
relationship, it was important not to be distracted by the "noise" but
to focus on "the solidity of the relationship" with "as little theater
as possible," and negotiate their way through the issues to find common
ground.
