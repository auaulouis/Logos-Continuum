#### Saudi will pursue nukes from Pakistan if U.S. military aid is cut

**Clary, former Defense Department South Asia policy adviser & Kerlin,
former Defense Department Middle East policy adviser, 12**

\[Christopher and Mara E., 6-10-12, American Interest, "The Pak-Saudi
Nuke, and How to Stop It",

Third, **[if the U.S.-Saudi security relationship were to break
down]{.underline}**, **[the Saudis might feel that any Western security
guarantee]{.underline}**, implicit or explicit, **[was insufficiently
credible to manage the Iranian threat]{.underline}**. In the context of
U.S. domestic fatigue with foreign commitments, and **[future U.S.-Saudi
conflict over democracy in the Middle East or some other issue, it is
not impossible to imagine a U.S.-Saudi security relationship that no
longer comforts Riyadh]{.underline}**.

Finally, **[it is much more likely that]{.underline}** **[Pakistan will
provide nuclear weapons technology if it is seeking to replace U.S.
aid]{.underline}** **[following a possible future rupture in the
relationship]{.underline}**. A U.S. pullout from Afghanistan, which will
make ground lines of communication and aerial overflight corridors in
Pakistan far less critical to U.S. national interests, will certainly
lower the barriers to another "divorce" in the relationship.

#### Guarantees Middle East nuclear proliferation

**Powell, Middle East Eye news editor, 19**

\[Jacob, 2-24-19, Middle East Eye, "Nuclear weapons proliferation: Fears
to increase if US sells technology to Saudi Arabia",
<https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/nuclear-weapons-proliferation-fears-increase-if-us-sells-technology-saudi-arabia>,
accessed 6-30-19, JAA\]

Experts, including Fuhrmann, said that **[even if Saudi Arabia pledges
to use nuclear technology for purely peaceful purposes, selling nuclear
materials to them still runs the risk of eventual
proliferation.]{.underline}**

**["When you think about a country like Saudi Arabia, they're operating
in a dangerous environment, already fighting proxy wars with countries
like Iran and there is a possibility of regional conflict in the
future,"]{.underline}** he told MEE.

From Saudi Arabia's standpoint, "you look at that situation and think
that there might be strong strategic incentive to want nuclear weapons",
he said.

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country's de-facto ruler, said
last March that if Iran attempts to pursue a nuclear weapon, Saudi
Arabia will do the same.

"**[If Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as
possible]{.underline}**," he told CBS.

**[\'They're operating in a dangerous environment, already fighting
proxy wars with countries like Iran and there is a possibility of
regional conflict in the future\']{.underline}**

\- Matthew Fuhrmann, Texas A&M

In order to make a bomb, Fuhrmann said, countries have to pursue one of
two avenues: acquire enriched uranium or plutonium reprocessing
capabilities - two highly complex and technical methods that are
difficult to acquire.

**["The ability to enrich uranium gives you the means to produce fissile
material for bomb-making in the form of weapons-grade highly enriched
uranium," he said.]{.underline}**

"**[If you have a plutonium reprocessing capability, you can separate
plutonium from spent nuclear fuel]{.underline}**," he added.

While the House report does not divulge what kind of technology the US
is trying to sell the Saudis, it does note that it is "highly
sensitive", which may imply uranium enrichment or plutonium reprocessing
technology, Fuhrmann said.

Still, Fuhrmann suggests, the proposed sale likely involves nuclear
power plants, which he also sees as a proliferation risk, but one that
is "less troubling than transferring enrichment or reprocessing
technology".

Saudi Arabia is a signatory of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty
(NPT), thereby pledging to not pursue nuclear weapons.

According to Fuhrmann, **[while the NPT has largely been effective in
curtailing the spread and development of nuclear weapons programmes, it
doesn't eliminate the possibility.]{.underline}**

"For example, Iran is a member of the NPT and has been for a long time,
but nonetheless for a period beginning in the 1980s and extending to at
least 2003, there was strong evidence that they had a nuclear weapons
programme," he said.

"Similarly, Iraq under Saddam Hussein was party to the NPT, but still
sought nuclear weapons. **[Even though the NPT gives us more confidence
in general that countries are not going to use technology illicitly, it
does not guarantee that won't happen," he said]{.underline}**.

### Plan Pushes Saudi Arabia to Pakistan

#### Saudi will pursue nukes from Pakistan if U.S. military aid is cut

**Pierson, lawyer and Pittsburgh Anti-Drone Warfare Coalition member,
19**

(Charles Pierson, *Counterpunch*, 3-8-2019, "Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and
the Bomb,"
<https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/03/08/saudi-arabia-pakistan-and-the-bomb/>,
DOA: 6-28-2019, NREM)

**[That's a lot of cabbage. How will Pakistan pay it back? One way is by
giving Saudi Arabia a bomb.]{.underline}**

Rumors of an arrangement or understanding under which **[Pakistan would
transfer nuclear weapons to the kingdom go back to the 1970s when Saudi
Arabia provided funding for Pakistan's nascent nuclear bomb
project]{.underline}**. On November 22, 2018, in a story titled "Saudis
Want a U.S. Nuclear Deal. Can They Be Trusted Not to Build a Bomb?" the
New York Times noted that

**[The Saudi government provided the financing for Pakistan to secretly
build its own nuclear arm]{.underline}**s.... **[That financial link has
long left American intelligence officials wondering if there was a quid
pro quo]{.underline}**: that **[if Saudi Arabia ever needed its own
small arsenal, Pakistan could provide it]{.underline}**....

The Times goes on to say that there may be an understanding that **[if
Saudi Arabia requests troops from Pakistan, those troops will bring
nukes with them]{.underline}**.

In a 2011 article, Bruce Reidel, author of Deadly Embrace: Pakistan,
America, and the Future of the Global Jihad, noted that

Some reports allege the RSAF \[Royal Saudi Air Force\] keeps a couple of
aircraft permanently deployed in Pakistan to be able to deliver the bomb
to Riyadh on short notice if the King asks for them \[sic\]. It is
impossible to know if these reports have any veracity but the idea makes
sense.

Pakistan and Saudi Arabia deny that they have a nuclear agreement.
However, Simon Henderson, an energy expert with the Washington Institute
for Near East Policy, agrees that

**[Saudi Arabia probably already has a nuclear weapons capability,
courtesy of Pakistan. The assumption is that Pakistan's nuclear-tipped
missiles could be sent to the kingdom, either to boost Saudi deterrence
against Iran or to safeguard part of Pakistan's strategic force in time
of crisis with India....]{.underline}**

Pakistan is currently in a crisis with India, one which may escalate to
nuclear war. For decades, Pakistan has trained, equipped, and given safe
haven to jihadi groups which it uses as proxies for attacks on India. On
February 13, an attack by militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad in
Indian-occupied Kashmir killed 40 Indian paramilitary police. India has
accused Pakistan of backing Jaish-e-Mohammad.

Since then, each side has carried out air attacks on the other's
territory, and each nation has claimed to have shot down the other's
warplanes. There has been firing across the Line of Control that divides
Kashmir between Pakistan and India. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan
has met with the country's National Command Authority, which controls
Pakistan's nuclear arsenal. The crisis could spiral into a full-scale
war. \[1\]

The Man with the Golden Gun

**[Christopher Clary]{.underline}** and **[Mara E. Karlin
predicted]{.underline}** in 2012 that it is

"likely **[that Pakistan will provide nuclear weapons technology \[to
Saudi Arabia\] if it is seeking to replace U.S. aid following a possible
future rupture in the relationship \[with the US\]."]{.underline}**

Complaining that the Pakistanis "don't do a damn thing for us,"
President Donald Trump slashed \$300 million of aid to Pakistan in
September. Like his predecessors in the Oval Office, Trump has wearied
of Pakistan's empty promises to crack down on militant groups which
attack NATO forces in Afghanistan. Bush and Obama tried using financial
pressure to force Pakistan to sever its ties with militants. Now it's
Trump's turn to try what has never worked in the past. The danger is
that US pressure could backfire, driving Pakistan closer to Riyadh.

Contrast the royal treatment Pakistan is receiving from Riyadh. **[MBS
made a state visit to Pakistan in February]{.underline}**. During his
two-day visit, the Pakistanis treated the Saudi crown prince like a rock
star. **[Pakistan lavished MBS with gifts, including]{.underline}**---no
joke---**[a gold-plated submachine gun. Pakistan's jubilance is
understandable. Bin Salman has promised Pakistan \$20 billion in Saudi
investments, throwing a lifeline to Pakistan which is in one of its
recurrent fiscal crises. Commentators say that MBS has cemented
Pakistan's membership in the Sunni alliance against Iran.]{.underline}**

We are left with a puzzle. Suppose it's true that Saudi Arabia can get
nukes from Pakistan at any time just like ordering a pizza. Does that
mean that the Saudis are telling the truth and only want nuclear
reactors in order to generate electricity? Then why is Riyadh insisting
on ENR as part of a nuclear cooperation agreement with Washington? Is
the Saudis' rumored "understanding" with Pakistan bogus? Maybe, maybe
not**[. If Riyadh does have an understanding with Pakistan it's in order
to hedge against Iran going nuclear. Riyadh may now have decided to
build its own bomb in order to hedge against a possibly unreliable
Islamabad---hedging on top of hedging.]{.underline}**

### AT -- Saudi Can't Get Nukes

#### Saudi has already purchased nuclear weapons from Pakistan

Pakistan - strategic alliance",

p. 2, accessed 6-30-19, JAA\]

**[Saudi Arabia has long aspired to achieve nuclear capacity of its own,
in order to counter Iran\'s atomic ambitions]{.underline}**. Saudi
Arabia hasn\'t hidden its ambition, openly stating to the U.S. as early
as 2009 that **[it would also seek capacity if \"Iran crossed the
threshold.]{.underline}**\" In May 2012, former senior U.S. diplomat
Dennis Ross confirmed for the first time that Saudi Arabia's King
Abdullah explicitly warned that if Iran obtains nuclear weapons, Saudi
Arabia would seek to do so as well. **[Saudi Arabia has had the missile
technology to deliver warheads since the late 1980s]{.underline}**.10

**[Saudi Arabia has little nuclear infrastructure of its own and it
could rely on its close ally,]{.underline}** **[Pakistan, that has a
history of proliferating nuclear technology and
equipment]{.underline}**. **[Saudi Arabia provided generous financial
support to Pakistan that enabled the nuclear program to
continue]{.underline}**, especially when the country was under
sanctions. Saudi cooperation with nuclear **[power Pakistan has been a
source of speculation about the kingdom's ambition]{.underline}**. It
has long been rumored, that in return for bankrolling the Pakistani
nuclear weapons project, Saudi Arabia has a claim on some of those
weapons in time of need.11

There are two main versions:  Future Pakistani "assistance would not
involve Pakistan supplying Saudi Arabia with a full nuclear weapon or
weapons, however, **[Pakistan may assist in other important ways, such
as supplying]{.underline}** **[sensitive equipment, materials, and
know-how used in enrichment or reprocessing]{.underline}**.  **[Saudi
Arabia has purchased nuclear weapons from Pakistan which are ready for
delivery to the]{.underline}** **[kingdom and that it possesses missiles
capable of delivering nuclear warheads.]{.underline}**

#### Pakistan will deliver the bomb on command 

**Winer, Times of Israel breaking news writer, 13**

\[Stuart, 11-7-13, The Times of Israel, "Saudi Arabia said to have
bought nukes from Pakistan",
<https://www.timesofisrael.com/saudi-arabia-reportedly-purchased-nukes-from-pakistan/>,
accessed 6-30-19, JAA\]

**["The Saudis]{.underline}** will not wait one month," Yadlin
reportedly said. "They **[already paid for the bomb, they will go to
Pakistan and bring what they need to bring."]{.underline}**

Another source, described as "a senior NATO decision maker," **[told
Urban earlier this year of an intelligence report about Pakistani-made
nuclear weapons ready for delivery to the kingdom]{.underline}**.

Since 2009 **[Saudi Arabia has been sending clear warnings to the US
that it will not sit back and let Iran go nuclear.]{.underline}**

"I do think that the Saudis believe that they have some understanding
with Pakistan that, in extremis," they would be able to get nuclear
weapons from Pakistan, Gary Samore, who until May this year was US
President Barack Obama's counter-proliferation adviser, was quoted as
saying.

**[The Saudis already have the means to deliver nuclear weapons after
acquiring Chinese-made CSS-2 missiles]{.underline}** during the 1980s.
The missiles, which have a range of over 2,500 kilometers, can be armed
with nuclear warheads. In addition, **[it has been clear for many years
that Saudi Arabia was funding the Pakistani defense
establishment,]{.underline}** the report said.

"**[What did we think the Saudis were giving us all that money
for]{.underline}**?" a senior Pakistan official was quoted as saying.
"It wasn't charity."

The report did not say whether the warheads would simply be handed over
to the Saudis, or if Pakistani military units would be deployed in the
kingdom to oversee their use, although it suggested that
**[Pakistani-made Shaheen (Falcon) ballistic missiles were already
stationed in Saudia Arabia]{.underline}**, minus their warheads.

In an email to the BBC, Yadlin left no doubt as to his take on the
gravity of the prospect of a nuclear-armed Saudi Arabia.

"**[Unlike other potential regional threats, the Saudi one is very
credible and imminent]{.underline}**," he wrote.

#### Saudi-Pakistan nuclear alliance is possible and likely -- especially in a world of outside distrust

on the Subcontinent Major Trends and the Iran Factor\"; Strategic
Perspectives No 14;

**[Saudi Arabia has a long and intertwined history with
Pakistan]{.underline}**.95 **[This history---underpinned by a common
Sunni Muslim heritage---has religious, cultural, economic, and political
dimensions.]{.underline}** It also has military dimensions dating back
decades. Pakistani pilots and ground troops have assisted with defense
of the Kingdom in separate actions during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.96
Military-to-military relations remain close. Chief among these
military-strategic interactions between the Kingdom and Pakistan has
been their relationship in the course of Pakistan's development of
nuclear energy and nuclear weapons.97

**[Saudi Arabia's unique relationship with Pakistan during Islamabad's
civilian nuclear power and nuclear weapons development program makes
this an especially important connection in the event of]{.underline}**
an ever-widening chain of **[Middle East and South Asia nuclear weapons
proliferation]{.underline}** in response to an Iranian nuclear weapon.
**[Should Saudi Arabia determine it to be politically necessary to
acquire nuclear weapons as a deterrent to Iran, Pakistan would be its
most likely accomplice. China and Saudi Arabia have underwritten
Pakistan's development of nuclear power and acquisition of nuclear
weapons. While the Chinese have provided the bulk of the technology and
nuclear power generation know-how, Saudi Arabia has financed much of
Pakistan's nuclear weapons program.]{.underline}**98 Saudi money also
cushioned Pakistan against the impact of western sanctions after
Islamabad conducted its first nuclear test in 1998.99

Although officially denied in Riyadh and Islamabad, **[many experts
believe that a secret and long-standing agreement exists that Pakistan
would provide the Kingdom with nuclear technology and weapons should the
Saudis feel threatened]{.underline}** by a third party nuclear program.
Observers of this relationship believe that the agreement was most
recently re-signed in October 2003 when then--Crown Prince Abdullah made
a state visit to Islamabad. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari has
reportedly verbally reaffirmed the Pakistani promise on his state visits
to the Kingdom since 2008. Mid-2012 press reports suggest that Pakistani
Prime Minister Raja Ashraf took the occasion of a summer visit to Saudi
Arabia to meet with King Abdullah in Jeddah to validate the
long-standing deal and confirm the details of preliminary coordination
such as training Saudi special forces in Pakistan for the rigors of
safeguarding nuclear weapons.100

Should such an arrangement exist, **[there are ample possibilities for
the deployment]{.underline}**---most likely temporary, but potentially
permanent---**[of Pakistani nuclear weapons in a deterrent posture for
the Kingdom]{.underline}** from their current locations in South Asia,
or by direct introduction into the Kingdom itself. **[The first
possibility is for Saudi Arabia to ask Pakistan for a declaration that
its nuclear weapons would be made available from sites in Pakistan in
retaliation for any use of nuclear weapons against the Kingdom by
Iran.]{.underline}**

**[A more direct possibility is for Pakistan to commit some of its
nuclear armed airplanes and pilots into Saudi airfields. Pakistan's air
force often trains and exercises with Saudi pilots, and there are many
commonalities in command and control approaches]{.underline}**.101
Pakistan might also send nuclear-capable missiles and trained crews to
Saudi Arabia. That would take more time and require Saudi spending on
launch-capable pads, nuclear storage facilities, and control systems
that do not currently exist in the Kingdom.102 Each of these options has
the additional advantage of aligning with the interpretation of the NPT
that enabled American stationing of its nuclear weapons in Europe during
the Cold War, namely that if nuclear weapons material remained under at
least shared Pakistani control in peacetime, the Saudis would
effectively join the nuclear club without technical violation of the
NPT.103

Alternatively, **[Pakistan might be asked to commence transfer of the
technical know-how and capacity for nuclear weapons into Saudi Arabia in
a phased process]{.underline}**. This approach, if not combined with one
of the above conditions, would take considerable time and be of
significant concern to Saudi Arabia's neighbors including Israel.

Despite the growing vigor in unofficial Saudi proclamations regarding
its intent to respond to a nuclear Iran, **[it is impossible to know
precisely which approach the Kingdom's leadership would
pursue]{.underline}** should Iran declare itself a nuclear power with or
without a successful nuclear test. **[It is clear as of early 2013,
however, that the Saudi leadership mistrusts American leadership---and
American promises---more than at any time in the recent history of
U.S.-Saudi relations.104 Thus, even a firm American declaration of
extended nuclear deterrence in support of Riyadh and its Sunni Arab
neighbors seems unlikely to be taken as the sole Saudi
approach]{.underline}**.105 The Kingdom is likely to seek Pakistan's
assistance in some capacity.

As noted above, Pakistan's specific arrangements with Saudi Arabia on
the matter of nuclear weapons remain opaque. It is easier to discern the
factors that would influence Pakistan's approach to a Saudi request for
nuclear assistance. Pakistani military and SPD officials make it clear
that they wish to avoid responding to a Saudi request for nuclear
weapons assistance, hoping that extended American nuclear deterrence
might fill the need.106 **[Should Saudi mistrust of American reliability
make this view unrealistic, Pakistan seems likely to
respond]{.underline}** while adhering to four imperatives.

### India-Pakistan Scenario

#### Saudi-Pakistan nuclear alliance causes India first strike and nuclear war

Saudi and Pakistan Alliance\";
https://www.thedailybeast.com/irans-nuclear-weapons-could-lead-to-a-saudi-and-pakistan-alliance;
accessed 6-30-19; PAC\]

**[A former Bush defense official says that]{.underline}**
**[Saudi]{.underline}** **[Arabia and]{.underline}** **[Pakistan might
initiate a dangerous alliance]{.underline}** if Iran develops nuclear
weapons. Andrew Roberts speaks to Eric Edelman about the unintended
consequences for South Asia.

**[Might]{.underline}** the impending nuclearization of Iran **[rapidly
lead to a situation in which India targets nuclear weapons on Saudi
Arabia? That is one of the many unnerving repercussions envisaged in an
authoritative article,]{.underline}** "The Dangers of a Nuclear Iran,"
in the current issue of Foreign Affairs, written **[by]{.underline}**,
among others, Eric **[Edelman]{.underline}**, President George W. Bush's
undersecretary of defense for policy from 2005 to 2009. **[When an
analyst of Edelman's seniority and ability, who moreover was working in
the Pentagon with full access to all the available intelligence on
precisely this issue as recently as two years ago, pronounces on
questions of this gravity it behooves us to pay serious
attention]{.underline}**.

Writing under the auspices of the high-powered defense think tank the
Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, Edelman and two
colleagues examine the ramifications of Saudi Arabia attempting swiftly
to acquire nuclear weapons from Pakistan the moment that it is clear
that Iran has them. **[He reports "rumors that Riyadh and Islamabad have
had discussions involving nuclear weapons, nuclear technology, or
security guarantees]{.underline}**." Now, **[people who have held jobs
as sensitive as Edelman's do not report "rumors" in a respected journal
like Foreign Affairs unless they believe them to be very much more than
that.]{.underline}**

Both in the article and more fully in an interview I have conducted with
him today, Edelman sets out his thinking on a subject that should have
very profound implications for decision-making in the Obama
administration as it considers the long-term ramifications of permitting
Iran to go nuclear. For although we can all see the primary and perhaps
also the secondary implications for security in the Middle East of the
so-called containment strategy, the United States must now ponder the
long-term tertiary and even later consequences. One of these must be
what Edelman terms "the Islamabad option," by which **[the Saudis and
Pakistanis would effectively enter into an offensive-defensive
"dual-key" nuclear arrangement]{.underline}**, rather like the one the
U.S. has had with Britain from the late-1960s to the present day.

The Saudis have already indicated privately---and WikiLeaks has done
nothing to cast doubt on this---that when what Edelman terms "the
nuclear cascade" is unleashed once Iran goes nuclear, they will be in
the first wave. "**[Saudi]{.underline}** Arabia **[is the
lynchpin,"]{.underline}** says Edelman, "the key country." The extremely
close links between the two Sunni countries Saudi Arabia and Pakistan,
which go back at least as far as 1979 when Pakistan helped to clear
Islamic fundamentalists out of the Grand Mosque, and A.Q. Khan's time in
Saudi Arabia at precisely the time when his nuclear-proliferation ring
was at its most active, invite what Edelman guardedly calls
"speculation" that a mutually convenient arrangement would be arrived at
very soon after Iran went nuclear. "Pakistan could sell operational
nuclear weapons and delivery systems to Saudi Arabia," states Edelman,
"or it could provide the Saudis with the infrastructure, material, and
the technical support they need to produce nuclear weapons themselves
within a matter of years, as opposed to a decade or longer." **[The
Saudis might not even, technically at least, be violating
the]{.underline}** Nuclear
**[N]{.underline}**on-**[P]{.underline}**roliferation
**[T]{.underline}**reaty **[if the weapons remained operated by the
Pakistanis]{.underline}**, albeit on Saudi territory. Nor does Congress
consider this all to be mere "speculation" either: The Senate Committee
on Foreign Relations Staff Report of February 2008 stated that **[there
was "some circumstantial evidence" to suggest that an agreement of some
sort might already exist between the two countries.]{.underline}** Where
Edelman goes an important stage further than anyone else is in
considering **[the instability that would inevitably result in Southern
Asia if Pakistan gained the capability in Saudi]{.underline}** Arabia
**[to withstand a first strike from India's nuclear arsenal. "To have a
second-strike capability against India would give Pakistan a huge
benefit]{.underline},**" he told me. "It **[would be very troublesome
for the Indians, who would face a far more complex nuclear
picture.]{.underline}**

We in the West have gotten fat, dumb, and happy when contemplating a
relatively stable nuclear Southern Asia over the past decade. It might
not stay like that." With Pakistan already ahead of India in nuclear
weapons technology, especially in delivery capabilities, Edelman
believes that **[the Islamabad option will make the nuclear situation in
South Asia significantly more dangerous.]{.underline}**

## Internal Link Defense

### No Alliance

#### No internal link -- Pakistan has massive geopolitical incentive to \*NOT\* tilt toward Saudi Arabia

**Rafi Sheikh, New Eastern Outlook international relations and Pakistan
affairs research analyst, 2-12-16**

\[Salman, 2-12-16, Asia Times, "Pakistan's balancing act between Iran
and Saudi Arabia",
<http://atimes.com/2016/02/pakistans-balancing-act-between-iran-and-saudi-arabia/>,
accessed 2-21-16, AFB\]

BY SALMAN RAFI on FEBRUARY 12, 2016 in ASIA TIMES NEWS & FEATURES,
MIDDLE EAST, SOUTH ASIA

**[Recent twists in Pakistan's foreign policy to maintain a balance
between Saudi Arabia and Iran reflect the country's historical obsession
with acting as the leader of the 'Muslim Ummah]{.underline}**' and also
the on-going sectarian tussle, roots of which can be traced to both the
Mid-Eastern states, within the country.

**[On the one hand, Pakistan cannot afford to distance itself too much
from Saudi Arabia. On the other hand, it can no longer afford to 'annoy'
a resurgent Iran due potentially to the problems it can stir in
Baluchistan, Pakistan's most restive province. Baluchistan is going to
play a central role in the success of China-Pakistan Economic
Corridor]{.underline}** (CPEC) **[due to its geographical location and
the all-important]{.underline}** Gwadar **[port.]{.underline}**

**[All these factors combined to push the Pakistani leadership, both
civil and military, to play a role in defusing tension between Saudi
Arabia and Iran]{.underline}**. However, the way this role was projected
publicly did, once again, prove how Pakistan continues to deploy,
despite years of bad experience, religious idiom in purely geo-political
matters.

However, this deployment of religious idiom was, as it has always been,
only meant for public consumption and to conceal the underlying
imperatives of urgent visits to both countries.

Fortunately enough, **[CPEC has put Pakistan's top leadership on the
same page, as far as the country's economic development in the wake of
the corridor is concerned. It is, as is widely believed in the official
and un-official diplomatic circles of Pakistan, the imperative of
reaping full benefits from China's "Silk Road" projects that has been
keeping Pakistan from engaging too much in the House of Saud's various
wars]{.underline}**.

**[Pakistan, therefore, desperately needs, as an official from
Pakistan's foreign ministry told me]{.underline}** on the condition of
anonymity, **[peace at home]{.underline}**. **[It cannot]{.underline}**
hope to **[fully harness the CPEC if it has to continue to fight the
so-called 'Pakistani-Taliban]{.underline}**', the foreign-funded
**[sectarian outfits and]{.underline}** the Baluch
**[nationalist-militant groups simultaneously.]{.underline}**

Of the three chief sources of security problems, Pakistan has recently
been quite vocal about the foreign-funded sectarianism. According to
interior ministry sources, 147 seminaries/madrassas in Punjab, 95 in
Gilgit Baltistan, 30 in Baluchistan, and 12 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and
one in Sindh are getting the funding. The funding and other support is
being provided by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, Kuwait, Iran, Turkey and
Iraq. In Punjab, 122 schools are Saudi-backed and 25 get Iranian
funding. Saudi money funds most madrassas in Baluchistan and Peshawar
while Iranian money funds most in Gilgit Baltistan in the north

As is evident, most of the funding, about 75% to 80%, comes from "Sunni
Arab" Gulf countries. It is due mainly to the fact that Pakistan itself
is predominantly a "Sunni" majority country. And, it is perhaps for this
very reason that Pakistan has to maintain a very calculated distance
from Saudi Arabia.

However, **[notwithstanding Pakistan's sectarian affinity with the House
of Saud, it is highly unlikely that 'sectarian factor' would determine
the actual course of Pakistan's foreign policy. An alliance with Iran,
on the other hand, can reap two immediate benefits. Not only would it
help neutralize the flow of sectarian funds from Iran into Pakistan's
north, but also enable Pakistan to better negotiate the ethno-national
movement in]{.underline}** the West i.e., **[Baluchistan,]{.underline}**
**[without having to tackle any Iran-backed upsurge.]{.underline}** Were
such a situation to occur, it would only add fuel to the already
extremely 'fiery' Baluchistan and damage CPEC too.

**[Therefore, tilt towards Tehran and imperceptible distance from Riyadh
is deeply rooted in Pakistan's orientation as the hub of regional
trade]{.underline}** to and from Southeast Asia to West Asia/Middle
East. **[It is for this very reason that Pakistan has, so far, not
extended any support, other than a few solidarity statements, to the
House of Saud's various wars.]{.underline}**

For instance, in April 2015, **[when Riyadh sought Islamabad's military
assistance in its newly launched war in Yemen, Saudi officials went home
empty-handed]{.underline}**. However, this time, Jubeir and bin Salman
heard two different messages from Islamabad. The head of the Pakistani
military, General Raheel Sharif, vowed a "strong response" to any threat
to Saudi security. **[The other message was from Prime
Minister]{.underline}** Nawaz **[Sharif. His emphasis was on a potential
role for Pakistan as a mediator between Saudi Arabia and Iran,
diplomatically sidestepping the burden of having to pick
sides]{.underline}**.

**[Pakistan, surprising as it looks, decided to adopt this course
despite the fact that Saudi Arabia has, through many years, been one of
the most important sources of subsidised oil and numerous covert
investments in Pakistan's military defense]{.underline}**. However, as
said earlier, **[the benefits Pakistan seem to be ready to reap in the
near future out of CPEC clearly outweigh what it has historically had
from the House of Saud]{.underline}**.

**[Pleasing the House of Saud, at this juncture, involves a cost that
Pakistan can ill afford.]{.underline}** This is due mainly to the
eagerness both China and Iran have shown in participating in the "Silk
Road" trade. During Chinese President's visit to Iran in January, Iran
and China signed 17 accords, including cooperation in nuclear energy and
a revival of the ancient Silk Road trade route, known in China as One
Belt, One Road.

The Chinese state-backed Global Times newspaper said in an editorial
that China hoped to improve ties with Iran as part of its sweeping plan
to rebuild trade links with Europe and Asia and carve out new markets
for its goods.

"China is of course considering its self-interest in strengthening
cooperation with Iran, especially at a time when China is in the midst
of expending efforts to push forward the One Belt, One Road initiative,
Iran is an important fulcrum," the paper said.

Given the geography of trade thus developing, it does not seem much
difficult to calculate that it is Iran that happens to fall on the route
of China's "Silk Road" not Saudi Arabia. Therefore, **[within the ambit
of Pakistan's participation in this "Silk Road" mega projects, Pakistan
can ill-afford to please the House of Saud at the expense of
Iran]{.underline}** or China.

### AT -- Pakistan Helps Saudi Proliferation

#### Pakistan won't fill in---they rely on Iranian oil

\[Zachary, 8-14-13, The Diplomat, "No, Pakistan Won't Sell Saudi Arabia
Nukes",

This fear is nothing new. As I've noted elsewhere, since the dawn of the
nuclear era the U.S. in particular has regularly feared that the world
was approaching a nuclear tipping point**[. The fact that a nuclear
cascade has failed to materialize has done little to dampen these
fears.]{.underline}**

Indeed, **[U.S. and Western officials have repeatedly stated that a
nuclear arms race in the Middle East is one of their gravest concerns
about Iran acquiring the bomb]{.underline}**. Saudi Arabia tops nearly
everyone's list of countries that are most likely to acquire a nuclear
weapon should Iran do so.

Saudi leaders have often tried to stoke these fears. Prince Turki, who's
a well-known personality in London and a card-carrying member of "This
Town" owing to his previous stints as Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the
UK to the U.S., has himself repeatedly threatened that Riyadh will
pursue its own atomic weaponry should Tehran go nuclear.

Riyadh's advocacy for U.S. airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities makes
it difficult to take Prince Turki and other Saudi officials at their
word on this point. Nonetheless, **[the Kingdom's prolonged rivalry with
Iran makes it reasonable to think Saudi Arabia would want a nuclear
weapon if Iran had one]{.underline}**.

Where the argument falters is when discussion turns to how Saudi Arabia
would go about acting on its atomic desires. Sure, **[Riyadh is
currently pursuing a civilian nuclear energy program through foreign
assistance, but it has limited indigenous human and industrial capital
to transform this civilian program into a nuclear weapon.]{.underline}**

At best, it would, like most recent nuclear proliferators, take a few
decades or more to build a bomb. **[Yet many Saudi Arabia experts don't
believe the current regime will stay in power for
decades]{.underline}**. Even if it did, **[acquiring a nuclear weapon by
mid-century would hardly be sufficient if a nuclear-armed Iran is as
detrimental to the Kingdom's interests as its leaders
claim]{.underline}**. In other words, by the time Riyadh could build its
own nuclear arsenal, Iran's nuclear acquisition would be a moot point.

For these reasons, **[those who fear a Saudi bomb don't contend that
Riyadh will build one itself, but rather argue it would buy a ready-made
arsenal from Pakistan.]{.underline}**

Islamabad's willingness to take the unprecedented step of supplying
Saudi Arabia with a nuclear arsenal is based largely on the testimony of
Mohammed Khilewi, a former Saudi UN diplomat who tried to defect to the
United States in the early 1990s.

In his efforts to win asylum in the West, Khilwei told government
officials and the media that Saudi Arabia had been trying to acquire a
nuclear weapon since the mid 1970s. As part of these alleged efforts,
Khilwei claims Saudi Arabia helped finance Pakistan's nuclear weapons
program during the 1970s and 1980s under the agreement that Islamabad
would furnish Riyadh with some of the finished product should Saudi
Arabia ever deem it necessary. Augmenting Khilwei's testimony are rumors
that Pakistan gave visiting Saudi officials a tour of its secret nuclear
facilities in the late 1990s.

Khilwei had obvious motives for fabricating his story, and Saudi Arabia
has little interest in trying to dispel the notion that it can acquire
nuclear weapons in short order.

**[But even assuming a Saudi-Pakistan nuclear pact was made in the
1980s, there's little reason to believe Pakistan would uphold
it.]{.underline}** After all, the United States has given Islamabad
billions of dollars to fight terrorism since 9/11, and Washington found
Osama bin Laden living in an off-campus mansion near Pakistan's military
academy. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia pressured Pakistan in the late 1990s
and early 2000s to get the Taliban to hand over bin Laden, and this too
came to naught.

In contrast to forcing the Taliban to hand over bin Laden**[, Pakistan
has compelling strategic reasons for not giving Riyadh nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**. For one thing, **[Islamabad is deathly paranoid
that its current arsenal is too small to survive an American or Indian
first strike, and is rapidly expanding its arsenal and trying to conceal
existing warheads as a result]{.underline}**. **[It is therefore
farfetched to think current Pakistani leaders would voluntarily part
with some of their nuclear warheads in order to uphold a deal their
predecessors made in the 1980s.]{.underline}**

**[Giving Saudi Arabia nuclear weapons would also have an immediate and
significant diplomatic backlash for Islamabad]{.underline}**. This is of
course true with the U.S. and the West, who control the International
Monetary Fund, which is helping keep Pakistan afloat. Additionally,
**[Pakistan's "all-weather" friend China would be none-too-happy with it
given Beijing's heavy reliance on Saudi crude.]{.underline}**

Iran would be even more infuriated by the move, and it has numerous ways
to retaliate against Islamabad. For starters, **[Tehran would cancel
plans to sell energy-starved Pakistan some badly needed natural gas.
Iran also has the ability to stir up trouble in Pakistan's
independent-minded Baluchistan Province as well as Afghanistan,
especially with the help of Islamabad's archenemy India, with whom
Tehran would undoubtedly vastly expand relations in response to Pakistan
selling Saudi Arabia a nuclear weapon.]{.underline}**

For all these reasons**[, Pakistan would not sell Saudi Arabia a nuclear
weapon]{.underline}**.

#### Pakistan won't abet proliferation -- NPT checks

**Hussain, South Asian Voices Visiting Fellow, MA in International
Relations from Quaid-i-Azam University, 16**

\[Yasir, 2-18-16, South Asian Voices, "WHY PAKISTAN WON'T GIVE NUKES TO
SAUDI ARABIA",
<https://southasianvoices.org/why-pakistan-wont-give-nukes-to-saudi-arabia/>,
accessed 7-1-19, JAA\]

Ever since it emerged as the sole Islamic nuclear state**[, Pakistan's
nuclear program has been viewed anxiously. Even if Islamabad were to
offer the world's best economic incentives to the West-dominated nuclear
regime, this assumed religiosity of Pakistani nuclear capability would
not change the thinking of the Christian and Hindu possessors of the
bomb]{.underline}**. This is despite the fact that no religion---Islam,
Hinduism, Christianity or any other--- has anything to do with the
possession of nuclear weapons. **[The utterly fantastic idea of Pakistan
extending nuclear weapons to Saudi Arabia is offensive, because there is
nothing religious about Islamabad's nuclear weapons]{.underline}**.
**[Pakistan's nuclear weapon capability is India-centric, and would not
be extended to any other state, including Saudi Arabia.]{.underline}**

Despite Pakistan's constant denial, Western media often claims that
Pakistan would sell nukes to the Saudis**[. This myth of selling nukes
to Riyadh reemerged during the nuclear deal negotiations between Iran
and P5+1.]{.underline}** Amos Yadlin, a former head of Israeli military
intelligence, stated during a conference in Sweden that if Iran got the
bomb, "the Saudis will not wait one month. They already paid for the
bomb, they will go to Pakistan and bring what they need to bring."

**[Allegations against Saudi Arabia for financing Pakistan's nuclear
program are not new]{.underline}**. In the past, it has also been
alleged that the Saudis financed Iraq's nuclear weapon program. Riyadh
has financially bailed out Islamabad on several occasions--- it supplied
50,000 barrels of free oil per day when economic and military sanctions
were imposed on Pakistan after the 1998 tests. The Saudis also gave
\$1.5 billion in support of Pakistan's dwindling foreign currency
reserves in 2014.

**[But that does not mean Saudi Arabia owns Pakistan's
nukes]{.underline}**. In return for Riyadh's financial assistance**[,
Islamabad has provided extensive military aid to the
country]{.underline}**. **[Pakistan has had troops stationed in the
country since the 1960s, and its manpower and military expertise still
play a pivotal role in the Kingdom's security.]{.underline}**

In a recent interview, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said that
**[Saudi Arabia would face "all kinds of (nonproliferation treaty)
consequences]{.underline}**" **[if they pursue nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**. **[It is important to note that Saudi Arabia is
bound by international nuclear nonproliferation norms, and is a
signatory to the NPT that has ratified Article II]{.underline}**. The
article states: "**[Each non-nuclear-weapon State Party to the Treaty
undertakes not to receive the transfer from any transferor whatsoever of
nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or of control over
such weapons or explosive devices direct,]{.underline}** or indirectly;
**[not to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other
nuclear explosive devices; and not to seek or receive any assistance in
the manufacture of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive
devices."]{.underline}**

Also, **[Saudi Arabia is a proponent of a WMD-free zone in the Middle
East]{.underline}**. Moreover, Riyadh inked a memorandum of
understanding with Washington in 2008, where America agreed to help them
develop civilian nuclear energy. In return, the Kingdom has given its
support for the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), to address the
challenges posed by proliferation of weapons of mass destruction**[. PSI
is intended to "stop proliferation related trade in WMDs, related
materials and delivery systems." Thus, claims regarding a possible
Saudi-Pakistani nuclear deal make little sense.]{.underline}**

More importantly, with the ratification of the Joint Comprehensive Plan
of Action it seems unlikely that Iran will be able to develop nuclear
weapons in the near future. Iran has started dismantling centrifuges and
other potential bomb-making capabilities that will prevent breakout
weapon capability. Hence, in the contemporary strategic environment, it
doesn't make sense for Riyadh to go nuclear. Saudi Arabia cannot afford
the international political and economic backlash that Iran experienced.
Due to an overwhelming dependence on foreign labor, international
isolation would cripple Riyadh economically. This is certainly a far
more disastrous consequence than nuclear Iran. Pakistan would face
widespread sanctions as well, and Islamabad is quite aware that it may
not be able to withstand such constraints.

**[Pakistan has established a multi-layered, strong command and control
system over the safety and security of its nuclear
facilities]{.underline}**. Furthermore**[, the nation has contributed
significantly to international norms on nuclear nonproliferation.
Pakistan is working to bring its trade controls in line with global
export control regimes, regularly hosts IAEA training activities at its
Nuclear Security Center of Excellence, and also participates in the
Nuclear Security Summit. Islamabad cannot afford any kind of nuclear
deal that would bring unbearable pressure from the international
community.]{.underline}**

For a long time, Pakistan has appealed for access to the global nuclear
market**[. Islamabad has been insistent on the normalization of its
nuclear program and acceptance into the global nuclear order. Any kind
of nuclear accord with Saudi Arabia would isolate
Pakistan]{.underline}**. Thereupon, **[nuclear cooperation between
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia would bring economic as well as social
calamity]{.underline}**. Hence, **[a Pak-Saudi nuclear accord under such
circumstances seems extremely unlikely to occur]{.underline}**. Rather,
a narrative has been created to restrict Pakistan's access to global
nuclear cartels such as Nuclear Suppliers Group.

### Iran Prolif Turn

#### US-Iran tensions cause Iran to quit the NPT

**Slavin, USA Today Senior Diplomatic Reporter, 19**

\[Barbara, 4-29-19, Atlantic Council, "Is Iran Running Out of Patience
With Nuclear Agreements?",
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/iransource/is-iran-running-out-of-patience-with-nuclear-agreements>,
accessed: 7-2-19, JAA\]

**[Ever since the Trump administration came to office, it has been
applying pressure on Iran without provoking a new proliferation crisis.
But the days of]{.underline}** Donald **[Trump having his baklava, so to
speak, and eating it too may be drawing to a close]{.underline}**.

In a series of public and private appearances last week in New York---on
the sidelines of a UN preparatory meeting for a 2020 review of the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)---Iranian Foreign Minister Javad
Zarif made clear that **[Iran's patience with the Trump administration
and the international community may be coming to an end.]{.underline}**

A year ago, the US withdrew unilaterally from the 2015 Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and last November, **[the Trump
administration re-imposed sanctions the US had lifted in 2016 in return
for curbs on Iran's nuclear activities.]{.underline}** The blow was
softened somewhat by six-month waivers granted to Iran's major oil
customers to buy reduced amounts of Iranian crude. But on April 22,
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared that there would be no new
waivers and that Iranian oil exports would go to zero unless Iran agreed
to massive changes in its foreign and domestic policies.

**[The new restrictions go into place on May 2 and it appears that they
will at least initially drastically slash Iran's already reduced exports
of about one-to-two million barrels a day to less than half a million
barrels,]{.underline}** sold through the black market. Iranians, who
until now have been complying with their obligations under the JCPOA,
are debating whether they should continue in light of the fact that Iran
is receiving almost no economic benefits, even from European countries
that trumpet their continued political support of the deal.

**[It is possible that Iran will withdraw from the agreement or begin to
bend it, enriching and stockpiling more uranium than
allowed]{.underline}**, for example, or installing more advanced
centrifuges at an enrichment plant at Natanz.

More ominously, Zarif told Iran's state broadcasting company that
**[Iran might even quit the NPT,]{.underline}** which it joined under
the Shah as a non-nuclear state. **[Such a step could be a preliminary
to building nuclear weapons.]{.underline}**

**["The Islamic Republic's choices are numerous, and the country's
authorities are considering them\... and leaving NPT is one of
them]{.underline}**," Zarif was quoted as saying.

The only signatory to quit the treaty in its half century of existence
is North Korea. It exited the NPT in 2002 to retaliate for the George W.
Bush administration's failure to meet its commitments under the 1994
Agreed Framework signed by President Bill Clinton. Bush administration
officials---led by now Trump national security adviser John
Bolton---argued that North Korea had cheated by starting a clandestine
uranium enrichment program. The Bush administration then stopped
providing North Korea with heavy fuel oil as required by the Agreed
Framework. Up until then, the North Koreans had not resumed plutonium
manufacturing---which had given them the material to make several
bombs---while their uranium activity was still in its infancy. As a
result of Bush's decision, however, the North Koreans restarted making
plutonium and tested their first nuclear device in 2006. Altogether,
they have tested six nuclear devices and also conducted multiple tests
of ballistic missiles capable of carrying a nuclear warhead.

**[Iran has never built or tested a nuclear bomb but carried on research
at least until 2003 that could have given it that
capability.]{.underline}** It cannot have escaped the Islamic Republic's
notice that President Trump has seemed far more eager to engage
diplomatically with North Korea---which has nuclear weapons---than Iran,
which does not.

Moreover, **[Trump has praised North Korean leader Kim
Jong-un]{.underline}**, met with him twice and not demanded any changes
in his authoritarian political system **[while endorsing what amounts to
a regime change strategy for Iran. Perhaps if Iran quit the NPT,
Iranians must be thinking, they would get more respect from
Washington]{.underline}**. In addition, the three-month period required
between **[notifying intent to withdraw and actually leaving the NPT
might finally incentivize Europeans to come up with a way to trade with
Iran despite US sanctions]{.underline}**. Europe has yet to
operationalize a so-called special payment vehicle that was meant to
facilitate such commerce.

Beyond showing impatience with what now looks increasingly like a
sucker's deal to many Iranians, Zarif also warned repeatedly that what
he called "the B-team"---**[Bolton, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and Emirati Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Zayed---are trying to provoke an incident between
Iran and the US that could lead to another Middle East
war.]{.underline}**

Taking the extraordinary step of going on Fox News, Trump's favorite
channel and not one sympathetic to Iran, **[Zarif urged the US president
not to allow Iran's adversaries to "drag" the US into a conflict. "I do
not believe President Trump wants to do that," Zarif
said.]{.underline}**

It remains to be seen whether Zarif's performance will yield any
results. For now**[, it is clear that US-Iran relations are at their
lowest point in decades without any high-level channels for
dialogue]{.underline}**. Iran has sent an experienced new ambassador to
the United Nations, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, who was one of the chief
negotiators of the JCPOA. But the US has yet to send a replacement for
Nikki Haley to the UN and Pompeo has shown no interest in talking to
Zarif.

Interesting, Takht-Ravanchi has both a bachelor's and a master's degree
from the University of Kansas, which might help him relate to Pompeo, a
former Republican Congressman from Kansas. **[Zarif has said Iran is
willing to talk about a swap of Americans jailed in Iran for Iranians
held in the US and abroad at the behest of US
authorities.]{.underline}**

In general, Zarif said Iran was willing to negotiate with the Trump
administration and would not wait for 2020 elections to see whether
Trump gets a second term. Iran, he told the Asia Society, is "waiting
for the White House to become rational, whether Republican or Democrat."
**[Coercion will not work, Zarif said, but only strengthen those in Iran
who believe that the country should not bow to pressure and that better
relations with the United States are not achievable.]{.underline}**

#### Withdraw causes nuclear proliferation

**Scheinman, Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation
Special Representative,18**

\[Adam M, 6-8-18, The Bulletin, "What if Iran leaves the NPT?",
<https://thebulletin.org/2018/06/what-if-iran-leaves-the-npt/>,
accessed: 7-2-19, JAA\]

In apparent retaliation for the US decision to pull back from the Iran
nuclear deal, **[Iranian officials warn that the country may withdraw
from the landmark Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).]{.underline}**
Whether Iran will or will not, or when and under what circumstances, are
unknowns. **[It should be recognized, however, that Iran's exit from the
pact would be hugely damaging, stressing the global nonproliferation
system to its limits.]{.underline}**

Iran would not be the first country to withdraw from the NPT. That
dubious distinction belongs to North Korea, which pulled out of the
treaty in 2003 and of course went on to build nuclear weapons and
intercontinental range missiles for their delivery. Yet, the effects of
North Korea's exit and strategic build-up are largely confined to East
Asia and US interests in the Pacific.

**[South Korea and Japan may one day reassess the decision to forego
nuclear weapons or to remain in the NPT]{.underline}**, but that's a
longer-term risk given that both are US treaty allies and enjoy the
protection of US military forces and nuclear umbrella.

Not to diminish the immensity of North Korea's nuclear challenge, but
**[Iran's withdrawal from the NPT carries weightier risks. It would
likely mean that Iran's Supreme Leader had given the green light to an
Iranian nuclear weapon]{.underline}**, **[opening the floodgates to NPT
withdrawals by other Arab states---Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Egypt head
that list. These and possibly other Sunni governments, none of whom can
rely on a major power for defense, may conclude that they require their
own nuclear weapon to check Iran's rise. The Saudis are very clear and
public on this point.]{.underline}**

More immediately**[, Israel may feel compelled to strike Iranian nuclear
facilities before they become fully operational]{.underline}**. This
raises the specter of **[a regional war that may draw in several of the
nuclear weapon states]{.underline}**---the United States, the UK,
France, and Russia---**[and reshape the Middle East in ways we cannot
predict. Whether the NPT could survive such a shock is another
unknown.]{.underline}**
