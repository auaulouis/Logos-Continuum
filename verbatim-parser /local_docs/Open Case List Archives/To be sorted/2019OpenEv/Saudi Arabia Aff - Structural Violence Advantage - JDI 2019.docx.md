#### Ending U.S. support for the Saudi regime is [an ethical imperative]{.underline}\-\--arms sales facilitate the [biggest humanitarian crisis in history]{.underline} by enabling Saudi Arabia to lead [indiscriminate]{.underline} bombing campaigns that [slaughter]{.underline} innocent civilians; causes [mass starvation]{.underline}, hundreds of thousands of [deaths]{.underline}, [refugee flows]{.underline}, and [epidemics]{.underline}.

**Sjursen**, 3-20-20**18** - Danny, U.S. Army strategist and former
history instructor at West Point. He served tours with reconnaissance
units in Iraq and Afghanistan; \"Key US Allies in the Middle East Are
the Real Tyrants,\" *Truthout*,
https://truthout.org/articles/key-us-allies-in-the-middle-east-are-the-real-tyrants/

In other words, Washington stands shoulder to shoulder with a truly
abhorrent regime, while simultaneously complaining bitterly about the
despotism and tyranny of nations of which it's less fond. The hypocrisy
should be (but generally isn't) considered staggering here. We're
talking about a Saudi government that only recently allowed women to
drive automobiles and still beheads them for "witchcraft and sorcery."
Indeed, **[[mass execution is a staple of the]{.mark}
regime]{.underline}**. Recently, [the [kingdom]{.mark} executed 37 men
in a single day]{.underline}. (One of them was even reportedly
crucified.) [[Most were]{.mark} not the]{.underline}
"[terrorists]{.underline}" [they were made out to be]{.underline}, [but
**[dissidents]{.mark}** from Saudi Arabia's Shia minority
convicted]{.underline}, [as Amnesty International put it]{.underline},
"[[after **sham trials**]{.underline}]{.mark} [that... relied on
confessions extracted through torture]{.underline}."

During the Arab Spring of 2011, [the [Saudi]{.mark} royals certainly
**[proved anything but friends]{.mark}** to the budding democratic
movements brewing across the region]{.underline}. Indeed, [[its military
even invaded]{.underline}]{.mark} a tiny neighbor to the east,
[[Bahrain]{.underline}]{.mark}, [to **suppress civil-rights
protests**]{.underline} by that country's embattled Shia majority. (A
Sunni royal family runs the show there.) [[In Yemen, the Saudis
**continue to terror bomb civilians**]{.mark} in its war against Houthi
militias]{.underline}. **[[Tens of thousands have
died]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- [the exact number isn't
known]{.underline} --- [under a brutal bombing campaign and at least
**[85,000 Yemeni children have already starved to
death]{.mark}**]{.underline} [thanks to]{.underline} the war and [a
Saudi blockade of]{.underline} what was already the [Arab world's
poorest country.]{.underline} [[The **hell unleashed**]{.underline} [on
Yemen has been]{.underline}]{.mark} [dubbed **[the world's worst
humanitarian crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It has already
[produced]{.mark} **[millions of refugees]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark}]{.underline}, at present, [[the world's **worst cholera
epidemic**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Through it all, [Washington stood by its royals time and
again]{.underline}, [with The [Donald]{.mark} far more gleefully
pro-Saudi than his predecessors]{.underline}. His first foreign
excursion, after all, was to that kingdom's capital, Riyadh, where the
president seemed to relish joining the martial pageantry of a Saudi
"sword dance." He also [[let]{.mark} it be known that [the
**cash**]{.mark} **would [keep flowing]{.mark}**]{.underline} [from the
kingdom into military-industrial coffers in this country]{.underline},
[[announcing a]{.mark} supposedly record [\$110 billion set of arms
deals]{.mark}]{.underline} (including a number closed by the Obama
administration and ones that may never come to fruition). Son-in-law
Jared [Kushner even continues to maintain a **bromance**]{.underline}
[with the ambitious and brutal ruling Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin
Salman.]{.underline}

In other words, [[with fulsome support from Washington]{.mark},
[sophisticated American weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} a
boatload of American [cash]{.mark}, [Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [continues to
**unleash terror at home and abroad**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This much is
certain: if you're looking for a troika of tyrants, that country should
top your list.

#### Conditions are [deteriorating by the minute]{.underline}\-\--every delay [exponentially worsens]{.underline} structural conditions that are [entirely preventable]{.underline}.

**Varfolomeeva**, 2-11-20**19** -- "Why is Yemen the world\'s worst
humanitarian crisis?," Rescue.Org,
<https://www.rescue.org/article/why-yemen-worlds-worst-humanitarian-crisis>

[Yemen is facing the largest humanitarian crisis in the
world]{.underline}. [Over **[22 million]{.mark}** people [are in need of
humanitarian assistance]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[the country is on the
**brink of famine**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[a million]{.mark} people
have [suffered from]{.mark} the **worst [cholera]{.mark} outbreak in
modern history**]{.underline}. Since 2015, [Yemen has been in the grip
of a brutal civil war]{.underline}. After rebel groups overtook the
government, the Saudi- and Emirati-led coalition has been attempting to
regain control by launching thousands of airstrikes, many of which have
hit homes and public areas such as schools, health facilities and
markets. Thousands of civilians have been killed and tens of thousands
injured as a result. In fact, August 2018 was the deadliest month so
far, [with nearly 500 civilians killed in the first nine
days]{.underline}. But these deaths represent only a fraction of the
impact of the airstrikes. Many more people suffer when the damage and
destruction left by the [[attacks **cut off their access to health care
and clean water**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The [attacks]{.mark} not only
violate international humanitarian law, but they also [make it
**dangerous** and **difficult** for humanitarian organizations]{.mark}
like the International Rescue Committee (IRC) **[to deliver
aid]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Even worse, the governments of the United
States and United Kingdom thus far have failed to use their leverage as
diplomatic allies and military supporters of the Saudi and Emirati-led
coalition to end the [violence This crisis only continues to grow as
conflict rages on and those in need are prevented from receiving
lifesaving assistance.]{.underline} Here's what you need to know about
why Yemen is home to the largest humanitarian crisis in the world. What
is the impact of the conflict on access to food, health services and
education? [**[Conditions in Yemen are deteriorating across every
measure]{.mark}**. Over 8 million people are at risk of starvation and
16 million lack access to basic health care. [As the airstrikes
continue]{.mark} --- **[one every 99 minutes]{.mark}** for the past
three years --- [Yemenis are unable to access]{.mark} the food and
health [services they need to survive]{.mark}. More than half of Yemen's
health care facilities have already been destroyed. On top of that,
**[the coalition is restricting access to ports]{.mark}**. And all sides
to the conflict have [[restricted]{.mark} humanitarian organizations
from providing lifesaving [medicine and clean
water]{.mark}](https://www.rescue.org/report/they-die-bombs-we-die-need-impact-collapsing-public-health-systems-yemen).
This only exacerbates the growing cholera epidemic, which has taken over
2,300 lives in the past year. Thousands of schools have also been closed
due to the conflict, keeping 2 million children out of the classroom.
Some **[schools have been taken over by armed groups]{.mark}** and
others used as shelter for people who have had to flee their homes or
whose homes have been destroyed.]{.underline}  As the violence
escalates, Yemen remains on the brink of catastrophe. Who is hit hardest
by this crisis? Children, the chronically ill, the elderly and disabled,
and pregnant women and nursing mothers are at particularly high risk of
starvation and sickness.  There are over 11 million Yemeni children in
need of aid -- that's almost every child in the country. According to
UNICEF, [**[a Yemeni child dies every ten minutes]{.mark}**
[from]{.mark} **[entirely preventable war-related causes]{.mark}**, and
thousands have already been killed or injured as a result of
conflict.]{.underline} Left in vulnerable positions from violence and
displacement, boys are being recruited by armed forces and young girls
are being forced into early marriages. What is the most critical
flashpoint right now? The port city of Hodeidah, where 70% of imports
enter the country, is under relentless attack from airstrikes and naval
ships. Houses, farms, livestock, businesses, roads, medical facilities
and water facilities have all been hit in recent months. The coalition
is encircling and likely attempting to besiege Hodeidah. This would have
a dire impact on the roughly 300,000 remaining civilians, who are among
the most vulnerable in all of Yemen. The United Nations warned that in
the worst case 250,000 civilians could be killed in an attack on
Hodeidah, with aid cut off to 22 million civilians in need of support.
Blocking this port could also trigger famine as millions are already on
the brink of starvation. IRC staff members have been advised to evacuate
their homes in Hodeidah City and are now working from a small town
located 31 miles from the frontlines of the war, where they continue
their lifesaving work. What are the most concerning threats on the
horizon? The U.N. has warned that 10 million more Yemenis will be at
risk of famine by the end of 2018 if conditions do not improve. The
number of suspected cholera cases also has increased, suggesting that
the country might face a new wave of the epidemic. [Civilians continue
to be killed, injured and forced from their homes as a result of
conflict and destruction.]{.underline} As [Kamel
Jendoubi](https://www.irinnews.org/news/2018/08/28/un-experts-signal-possible-war-crimes-yemen),
Chair of the The Group of Eminent Experts, said, "There is little
evidence of any attempt by parties to the conflict to minimize civilian
casualties." What needs to be done to stop the suffering? There is no
military solution to the end of the war in Yemen. The IRC calls on all
parties to immediately stop the fighting and allow room for a U.N.-led
peace process to take place in order to avoid further humanitarian
catastrophe. "The protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure is
not a luxury," said Frank Mc Manus, Yemen country director at the IRC.
"It is an essential provision of international law. When these laws fail
civilians suffer." What is the IRC doing to help? The IRC has been
delivering lifesaving services in Yemen since 2012. While the ongoing
conflict and closures of airports and sea ports create challenges to our
response, the IRC has maintained access to affected populations in our
areas of operation.The IRC runs medical treatment centers, made
household visits to promote cholera prevention awareness, [screened and
treated children for
malnutrition](https://www.rescue.org/article/follow-mobile-health-team-treating-children-yemens-remotest-villages),
counseled mothers and caregivers on safe feeding and breastfeeding, and
trained and paid health volunteers to work in local communities. This
year the IRC expects to help over 50,000 people access clean water and
sanitation, and over 800,000 people access primary and reproductive
health care through a network of 135 IRC-supported health facilities
.Empowering those affected by the crisis to rebuild their lives, the IRC
distributes cash vouchers to hundreds of households so they can purchase
the food and basic resources they need to survive.

#### The plan [moderates]{.underline} Saudi aggression in Yemen\-\--the U.S. is key AND other countries model. That [enables delivery of aid]{.underline} to avoid further humanitarian disasters.

**Spindel**, 5-14-20**19** - Jennifer, assistant professor of
international security at the University of Oklahoma, and the Associate
Director of the Cyber Governance and Policy Center; \"The Case for
Suspending American Arms Sales to Saudi Arabia,\" War on the Rocks,
https://warontherocks.com/2019/05/the-case-for-suspending-american-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia/

Arms embargos are often dismissed as symbolic, and therefore
ineffective. But just because something is symbolic, doesn't mean that
it won't have an effect. [A U.S. [arms embargo against Saudi]{.mark}
Arabia [would be a **clear signal**]{.mark} [of American disproval
of]{.mark} Saudi [actions in Yemen]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [and
would be [an **equally important signal**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[to]{.mark} Washington's [allies]{.mark}]{.underline}, who are left
wondering if the United States is ambivalent or uninterested in the
growing Yemeni humanitarian catastrophe.

[By [continuing to provide weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}, President
Donald [Trump]{.underline} tacitly **[[endorses Saudi
policies]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[This signal is
**strengthened**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[by]{.mark} [Trump's]{.mark}
recent [veto]{.mark} of the resolution that called for an end to U.S.
support for the war in Yemen]{.underline}. While Trump justified the
veto by saying that the resolution was a "dangerous attempt to weaken my
constitutional authorities," statements from Congressional
representatives show they are aware of the powerful signals sent by arms
sales. Sen. Tim Kaine said that the veto "shows the world
\[[Trump]{.underline}\] [is determined to keep aiding a Saudi-backed war
that has killed thousands of civilians]{.underline} and pushed millions
more to the brink of starvation." [An arms embargo against Saudi Arabia
would be a **signal**]{.underline} [both to leaders of that country, and
other states, that the United States **does not endorse Saudi
actions**]{.underline}. Those arguing against a ban are correct on one
point: Embargos as blunt force instruments of coercion are rarely
effective. But [[arms embargos are]{.mark} **[effective]{.mark} as
[signals of political dissatisfaction]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[and]{.mark} [serve an **important communication role**]{.mark} in
international politics]{.underline}.

Arms Embargos Are Signals and Can Build Coalitions

Policymakers and scholars agree that arms embargoes are not effective
"sticks" in international politics. Rarely do states cave when faced
with punishment in the form of an embargo. But even if an arms embargo
isn't a direct tool of coercion, [an embargo would be an important
political signal]{.underline}. There are at least two reasons for the
United States to seriously consider an arms embargo against Saudi
Arabia.

First, [arms sales are signals that **cut through the noise** of the
international system]{.underline}. Cutting off arms transfers is a
common way that states express their dissatisfaction with others and try
to influence behavior. As Lawrence Freedman observed in 1978,
"[[refusing to sell]{.mark} arms [is]{.mark} a major political
act]{.underline}. It appears [as **[a calculated
insult]{.mark}**]{.underline}, reflecting on the stability, trust, and
credit-worthiness, or technical competence of the would-be recipient."
Yet [this crucial point seems to have been lost in the current policy
debate]{.underline} about whether or not the United States should
continue selling arms to Saudi Arabia. My research shows that [stopping
arms transfers or denying requests is an **[effective way to signal
dissatisfaction]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and causes the]{.mark} would-be
[recipient to **re-think their behavior**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Take, for example, the U.S. relationship with Israel in the 1960s. [The
United States sold Israel Hawk surface-to-surface missiles in
1962]{.underline}, M-48 Patton tanks in 1964 and 1965, and A-4E Skyhawk
bombers in 1966. [Israeli leaders understood that these transfers
signaled a close U.S.-Israeli relationship]{.underline}. As diplomat
Abba Eban wrote, the arms transfers were "a development of tremendous
political value." [Even against this backdrop of close ties and
significant arms sales]{.underline}, [Israeli leaders were
extremely]{.underline} [sensitive to arms transfer denials]{.underline}.
In April and May 1967, [the United States denied Israeli requests for
armored personnel carriers and fighter jets]{.underline}. [Approving the
transfers]{.underline} [would have signaled support]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} likely [emboldened Israel]{.underline}, as tensions
were growing in the region. Israeli leaders believed these transfer
denials overruled prior signals and demonstrated that the United States
was not willing to be a close political ally for Israel. Eban described
Israel as "isolated," and the head of Israel's intelligence service said
that the arms transfer denials made it clear that "in Israel, there
existed certain misperceptions \[about the United States\]." If arms
transfer denials could have such a significant effect on Israeli
thinking --- keeping in mind that there was a close and significant
political relationship between the US and Israel --- imagine what a
transfer denial would mean for U.S.-Saudi relations. Like Israel,
[[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [would have to **re-think its
impression**]{.mark} that [it has political support and approval from
the United States]{.mark}]{.underline}. We can, and should, ask whether
or not withdrawal of U.S. support would affect Saudi behavior, but it's
important that this question not get overlooked in the current debate.

Because [arms transfers]{.underline} (and denials) are powerful signals,
they can [have an effect even before a transfer is actually
completed]{.underline}. This suggests that [even the announcement of an
embargo against Saudi Arabia could have an effect]{.underline}. Take,
for example, [Taiwan's recent request for a fleet of new fighter
jets]{.underline}. [As reports mounted]{.underline} that [Trump had
given]{.underline} "[tacit approval]{.underline}" [to a deal for F-16
jets]{.underline}, **[China's protests increased]{.underline}**. The
United States has not sold advanced fighter jets to Taiwan since 1992,
partially out of fear of angering China, which views Taiwan as a
renegade province. Even if the deal for F-16s is formally approved,
Taiwan is unlikely to see the jets until at least 2021, and the balance
of power between China and Taiwan would not change. As one researcher
observed, the sale would be a "huge shock" for Beijing, "But it would be
more of a political shock than a military shock. It would be, 'Oh, the
U.S. doesn't care how we feel.' It would be more of a symbolic or
emotional issue." Yet [China's immediate, negative reaction to even the
announcement of a potential deal shows how powerful arms transfer
signals can be]{.underline}.

If this same logic is applied to an arms embargo against Saudi Arabia,
[an arms [embargo]{.mark} would signal that Saudi Arabia does not have
the support of the United States]{.underline}. [This signal [would be an
**important first step in changing Saudi behavior**]{.mark} because [it
would]{.mark} **[override]{.mark} other [statements and actions]{.mark}
the United States has sent [that indicate
support]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And [[Trump]{.mark} [has given
Saudi]{.mark} Arabia a **number of [positive
signals]{.mark}**]{.underline}: He called Saudi Arabia a "great ally"
and dismissed reports that that the Saudi government was involved in the
murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. He has expressed interested in
selling nuclear power plants and technology to Saudi Arabia. And he has
repeatedly claimed that he has made a \$110 billion arms deal with Saudi
Arabia (he hasn't). [With these clear signals of support]{.underline},
[why should Saudi Arabia alter its behavior based on resolutions that
come out of the House or Senate]{.underline}, [which are likely to be
**vetoed** by Trump, anyway?]{.underline} [An arms [embargo]{.mark}
[would be a **clear** and **unambiguous**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[signal]{.mark} that [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [disproves of
Saudi actions in Yemen]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The second reason for supporting an embargo concerns U.S. allies and the
logistical difficulties of making an embargo have an effect. One of the
reasons embargoes have little material impact is because they require
cooperation among weapons exporting states. A ban on sales from one
country will have little effect if the target of the embargo can seek
arms elsewhere. Germany, instituted an arms ban against Riyadh in
November 2018, and German leaders have pressured other European states
to stop selling arms to the Saudis. Germany understands the importance
of the embargo as a political signal: as a representative of the German
Green Party explained, "The re-start of arms exports to Saudi Arabia
would be a fatal foreign policy signal and would contribute to the
continued destabilization of the Middle East." But the German embargo
has had minimal effect because Saudi Arabia can get arms elsewhere.

According to the 2019 Military Balance, [most of Saudi Arabia's
equipment is American or French]{.underline} in origin, such as the M1A2
Abrams and AMX-30 tanks, Apache and Dauphin helicopters, and F-15C/D
fighter jets. [Saudi Arabia has some equipment manufactured wholly or in
part in Germany]{.underline}, such as the Eurofighter Typhoon and the
Tornado ground attack craft, [but these weapons are a small portion of
its complete arsenal]{.underline}. [A U.S. [embargo would **send an
important signal to the allies**]{.mark} [who also supply Saudi]{.mark}
Arabia]{.underline}, [allowing them to explain participation in the
embargo to their own domestic constituencies]{.underline}. [[This
is]{.mark} **[especially important]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} countries like
[France]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[Germany]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and the
U]{.mark}nited [K]{.mark}ingdom]{.underline}, [[that **need to export
arms**]{.mark} to keep their own production lines running]{.underline}.
[While the research shows that sustaining an arms embargo is often the
most difficult step]{.underline}, [[embargoes]{.mark} can **[restrain
sending states' arms exports]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Even if a U.S.
embargo won't have a direct effect]{.mark} on Saudi Arabia on its
own]{.underline}, [[an embargo is **important for building
coalitions**]{.mark} for a more expansive embargo that could affect
Saudi behavio]{.underline}r.

The Difficulty of Stopping Atrocities

Beyond signaling, we know [U.S. arms sales often end up in the wrong
hands]{.underline}, [and have been used in Yemen]{.underline}. The
Saudi-led war in Yemen has [led to starvation conditions]{.underline},
[caused thousands of civilian casualties]{.underline}, [and has led to
the displacement of millions of people]{.underline}. [The United Nations
estimates that 80 percent of Yemen's population]{.underline} -- 24
million people -- [require some form of humanitarian]{.underline} or
protection assistance, and that the severity of the situation is
increasing. Would an arms embargo create meaningful change in Yemen?

[An initial effect of an embargo is that Saudi Arabia would have to work
harder to access war materiel]{.underline}. As Jonathan Caverley noted,
[[**more than 60 percent** of Saudi]{.mark} Arabia['s]{.mark}
[arms]{.mark} delivered in the past five years [came from the United
States]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even if this percentage decreases over
time, **[[it will be costly]{.mark} for Saudi Arabia [to transition to
a]{.mark} primarily [Russian- or Chinese-supplied
military]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Though Saudi Arabia might be willing
to pay this cost,]{.underline} [[it would]{.mark} still [have to
pay]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} **take the time to
[transition]{.mark}**]{.underline} to its new weapons systems. [This
[would represent a]{.mark} **[brief break in
hostilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that could facilitate the delivery
of aid and assistance in Yemen]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Signaling [disavowal]{.underline} of Saudi aggression facilitates a [peace deal]{.underline} that [immediately ends]{.underline} the bombing campaign.

**Harb, 3-1**-2019 - Ali, \"Saudi Arabia would end Yemen war without US
support, experts say,\" Middle East Eye,
https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/saudi-arabia-would-end-yemen-war-without-us-support-experts-say

[[Ending American assistance]{.mark} to the Saudi-led coalition fighting
in Yemen [would **curtail Riyadh\'s war efforts**]{.mark} and hasten the
end of what the United Nations describes as the world\'s worst
humanitarian crisis, experts say]{.underline}.

A push by US lawmakers to end support for the war once appeared largely
symbolic, with only a few Democrats in the Republican-controlled
[[Congress]{.mark} [putting forward a proposal]{.mark}]{.underline}, but
now legislators may be set [to pass a measure [that would halt US
assistance]{.mark} to Saudi-led forces in Yemen]{.underline}.

[That [would have a **critical impact**]{.mark}]{.underline}, said
Robert [Jordan, former US ambassador to Saudi Arabia in the early
2000s]{.underline}, [who described US support as **crucial** to
Riyadh\'s military capabilities]{.underline}.

\"[If we suspend providing spare parts for their F-15s, [their air force
would be **grounded in two weeks**]{.mark},\"]{.underline} Jordan told
Middle East Eye last week. \"So I think [there is every prospect
that]{.underline}, if that occurs, [[they will **find it more
appealing**]{.mark} [to go to the peace table]{.mark} [and
negotiate]{.mark} than they currently do]{.underline}.\"

The proposed US legislation cleared the House of Representatives last
month, and the Senate, which approved a similar motion late last year,
is expected to vote on it again in the near future.

[The bill invokes the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which prohibits the
involvement in a foreign conflict without congressional
authorisation]{.underline}. President Donald Trump has vowed to veto the
legislation, which would require a two-thirds majority in the Senate to
override.

\'Extremely important\'

Khalil Jahshan, executive director of the Arab Center Washington DC,
said [both Washington and Riyadh would like to downplay the impact of
American involvement in Yemen, but [the US role in the war
remain]{.mark}s]{.underline} \"**[[extremely
important]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" **[[logistically and
politically]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[Beyond helping with military assistance, [Washington]{.mark}
[provides]{.mark}]{.underline} \"[**[psychological and strategic
cover]{.underline}**\"]{.mark} [to Saudi war efforts]{.underline}, he
said.

\"[[If it weren\'t for American support]{.underline}]{.mark}, if that
were to be withdrawn in the future \... I think [[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia
[would feel **compelled to end that war faster than they would
like**]{.mark},\" Jahshan said]{.underline}.

While Trump is often criticised for his cozy relationship with Saudi
Arabia\'s rulers, the conflict in Yemen started under his predecessor,
Barack Obama.

Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates started a massive bombing
campaign in Yemen in 2015 to restore the government of President Abd
Rabbuh Mansour Hadi after Houthi rebels captured the capital, Sanaa.

[If the US turns off the tap to the Saudis and Emirates \... the
pressure to end the war would be **very hard to resist**]{.underline}

-Nabeel Khoury, former US diplomat

While the congressional bill does not prohibit military sales, US
lawmakers are poised to scrutinise future Saudi purchases of US weapons,
fuelled by anger following the assassination last October of Washington
Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by a Saudi hit-squad.

US help to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen has included mid-air
refuelling of fighter jets, aid with a naval blockade and help
coordinating military operations, among other things.

Nabeel Khoury, a former US diplomat who served in Yemen from 2004 to
2007, said that assistance has been vital to Saudi Arabia\'s military
plans.

\"[That]{.underline} [these two regimes depend heavily on US support is
**undeniable**]{.underline},\" Khoury said of Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates. \"Definitely at the beginning, they could not have
started this war without US and UK support.\"

However, over the course of the war, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi have developed
their own military capabilities and hired private experts and
mercenaries to help them, he said.

Indeed, when Washington halted mid-air refuelling last year, the Saudis
acquired the capacity to do it on their own.

Khoury, now a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said
ending Washington\'s assistance, including arms sales, would force Saudi
Arabia to end the conflict.

He cited Trump\'s comments from last year, when the president said Saudi
Arabia \"might not be there for two weeks\" without US support. \"It is
in the Saudis\' ability to stop the war if they genuinely wanted to,\"
Khoury told MEE.

\"[[If the US turns off the tap to the Saudis and
Emirates]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the Saudis and Emirates turn off the
tap for the people in Yemen that they support, including the hired
mercenaries from all over the world, **[[the pressure to end the war
would be very hard to resist]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\"

Still, the former diplomat warned that the situation in Yemen is
complicated, with conflicting agendas and several parties involved,
including Houthi rebels, southern separatists, government loyalists,
followers of former president the late Ali Abdullah Saleh and hardline
militants including al-Qaeda.

\"It\'s not like you could say, \'Stop everything\' today and tomorrow
everything stops,\" Khoury said. \"But essentially, [without American
and British support the air coalition would find it **very hard to
continue** with this war]{.underline}.\"

#### The plan [shifts jurisdiction]{.underline} over sales to Saudi and the UAE [away from the executive]{.underline}\-\--it's binding AND no DA's because congress will approve [defensive]{.underline} weapons sales.

anti-missile batteries [[that could protect Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [from
Houthi]{.mark} Scud [missiles]{.mark}.]{.underline} Furthermore,
[[Congress can]{.mark} and **should [demand]{.mark}** that the
administration fulfil its existing [reporting
requirements]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Members of Congress have asked tough
direct questions that Pentagon can answer about the impact of American
refueling, and the nature and impact of targeting
intelligence]{.underline}.

Those measures alone, however, will not be enough. Congress ought to
write new legislation that imposes far more substantive reporting and
certification obligations on the administration. [Legislation with more
teeth would make it much harder for the administration to treat
certification as a hollow pro forma exercise]{.underline}. Such
[legislation should not allow for national security
waivers]{.underline}, which in the past have been used by
administrations to sidestep Congressional oversight. [[Tougher
legislation would]{.underline}]{.mark} also **[[suspend ongoing
sales]{.underline}]{.mark}** [if the administration does not actively
fulfil its reporting requirements]{.underline}. [The Pentagon has an
affirmative obligation to prove that its actions are fulfilling the
United States' stated aims]{.underline}---[in the case of the Yemen War,
that U.S. actions are **advancing strategic aims** and **reducing
civilian casualties**.]{.underline}

[The problem of weapons sales transcends the Yemen War and has
contaminated a growing swathe of U.S. policy]{.underline}. [Weapons
sales]{.underline} have [acquired a **pernicious logic**]{.underline} of
their own, [as if funding the U.S. weapons industry were a jobs creation
program and national security policy simply a means to promote domestic
economic growth]{.underline}. [[U.S. weapons sales can be a **major
driver of conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark} and [have **[routinely
complicated foreign policy]{.mark}** [in regions where the imperative to
maintain market shares conflicts with core U.S.
interests]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [In specific cases like the
Yemen War]{.underline}, where **[weapons sales]{.underline}** run so
thoroughly against U.S. policy goals, they **[should end
conclusively]{.underline}**.

To date, [the United States has been almost entirely unwilling to give
up any weapons contract]{.underline}, no matter how noxious, because of
the adverse impact to the U.S. economy. **[This type of [path dependency
is counterproductive]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The United States must be
willing to forego profitable contracts that harm our interests or bind
us to ineffective allies or specific misguided policies]{.underline}.

Winding Back the Forever War

The line between the Yemen War and America's global war on terror is not
a long one. Congress authorized the president to use military force
against the perpetrators of the September 11th attacks. Since then,
military action has become a reflex rather than a rarity. U.S. foreign
policy since 2001 has been dominated by direct and indirect
intervention, ranging from outright invasion and occupation, as in Iraq
in 2003, to dozens of undeclared and unmonitored actions that might not
meet the legal definition of direct military action. Trump's excesses
are an expansion of, rather than a departure from, the practices of his
predecessors. [Congress and public opinion have tended to applaud
military adventurism when they like its results and have avoided
confrontation with the executive branch even in cases where they
disapprove]{.underline}. **[[Endless war]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[has
successfully been sold as a public necessit]{.mark}y in a campaign
against terrorism, even when U.S. military action makes the world, and
Americans, less safe.]{.underline}

[There are]{.underline}, of course, [real security threats]{.underline},
[and counter-terrorism deservedly is a **high priority** for American
officials]{.underline}---including in Yemen. [An effective
counter-terrorism policy would move away from a military paradigm toward
a policing framework]{.underline}, [in which the military supports a
policy that pursues terrorist networks much the same way that it pursues
organized crime syndicates]{.underline}. As the practice stands, the
forever war it has produced and perpetuates has corroded American values
and behavior. Malpractice abroad has bred contempt for our democratic
values and a hopelessness about the rule of law at home. [Ideological
frameworks used to justify foreign intervention and mistreatment of
civilians in conflict zones have also been invoked at home]{.underline}.
[[Threat inflation]{.mark} and demagoguery have [helped fuel **bigotry
and xenophobia at home**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Elected officials now
risk their careers if they try to openly address the tradeoff between
security and rights.

[[Ending the United States' part in the Yemen
campaign]{.underline}]{.mark} won't suddenly bring an end to the
American forever war. But it [[would]{.mark} **[mark a turning
point]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[[a **decisive rejection**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [reflex to sign onto any military
conflict]{.mark} with even the slightest connection to
terrorism]{.underline}. [[The United States has a great many tools at
its disposal **beyond weapons sales**]{.mark} and direct engagement in
hostilities]{.underline}. [We can pursue our interests in Yemen while
avoiding extremes]{.underline}; [and American self-interest does not
require it to fully reject its traditional allies in the Gulf nor to
actively join them in their worst excesses. A rational assessment of
that self-interest might now be possible.]{.underline}

US leverage

While it's [true]{.underline} that Russia and China are indeed major
exporters of armaments, [the claim that U.S. weapons can easily be
replaced by other suppliers is **not**]{.underline} -- at least not in
the short term.

First, [[once a country is]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[locked
in]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[to a specific]{.mark} kind of
[weapons]{.mark} syste]{.underline}m, such as planes, tanks or naval
vessels, [the **[cost to switch]{.mark}** to a different supplier [can
be **huge**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Military personnel must be
retrained]{.mark} on new equipment]{.underline}, [spare parts need to be
replaced]{.underline}, [[and **operation**]{.mark}**al
[changes]{.mark}** may be necessar]{.underline}y.

[After being so reliant on U.S. weapons systems for
decades]{.underline}, [the [transition cost]{.mark}s to buy from another
country [could be **prohibitive even for oil-rich Saudi**]{.mark}
**Arabia**]{.underline}.

The second problem with Trump's argument is that [[armaments from
Russia, China or elsewhere are]{.mark} simply **[not as
sophisticated]{.mark}** as U.S. weapons]{.underline}, [which is why they
are usually cheaper]{.underline} -- [though the quality gap is quickly
decreasing]{.underline}. [[To **maintain**]{.mark} **its [military
superiority]{.mark}** in the Middle East, [Saudi]{.mark} Arabia has
opted to **[purchase]{.mark} virtually all of its [weapons from American
and European companies]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

That is why the U.S. has significant leverage in this aspect of the
relationship. [[Any Saudi threat to retaliate against a ban on]{.mark}
U.S. [arms sales]{.mark}]{.underline} by buying weapons from countries
that have not raised concerns about the Khashoggi disappearance
**[[would not be credible]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [And is probably
why]{.underline}, despite worries in the White House, [such a threat has

### 1ac\-\--impact framing

#### Probability first:

#### Existential impacts are predicated on [speculative]{.underline} internal link chains\-\--solutions to high-probability impacts creates a [positive feedback loop of improvements]{.underline}, which should come first.

**Karnofsky 2014;** July 03, 2014 Holden Karnofsky Executive Director of
the Open Philanthropy Project degree in Social Studies from Harvard
University "The Moral Value of the Far Future"
<https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/moral-value-far-future>

The importance of the far future As discussed previously, I believe that
the general state of the world has improved dramatically over the past
several hundred years. It seems reasonable to state that the people who
made contributions (large or small) to this improvement have made a
major difference to the lives of people living today, and that when all
future generations are taken into account, their impact on generations
following them could easily dwarf their impact in their own time. I
believe it is reasonable to expect this basic dynamic to continue, and I
believe that there remains huge room for further improvement (possibly
dwarfing the improvements we've seen to date). I place some probability
on global upside possibilities including breakthrough technology, space
colonization, and widespread improvements in interconnectedness, empathy
and altruism. Even if these don't pan out, there remains a great deal of
room for further reduction in poverty and in other causes of suffering.
In Astronomical Waste, Nick [Bostrom makes a more extreme and more
specific claim: that the number of human lives possible under space
colonization is so great that the mere possibility of a hugely populated
future, when considered in [an "expected value"]{.mark} framework,
dwarfs all other moral considerations]{.underline}. I see no obvious
analytical flaw in this claim, and give it some weight. However,
[because the argument [relies heavily on]{.mark} **[specific predictions
about a distant future]{.mark}**]{.underline}, seemingly (as far as I
can tell) **[[backed by little other than
speculation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [I do not consider it
"robust,"]{.underline} [and so I do not consider it rational to let it
play an overwhelming role in my belief system and actions]{.underline}.
(More on my epistemology and method for handling non-robust arguments
containing massive quantities here.) In addition, if I did fully accept
the reasoning of "Astronomical Waste" and evaluate all actions by their
far future consequences, it isn't clear what implications this would
have. As discussed below, given our uncertainty about the specifics of
the far future and our reasons to believe that doing good in the present
day can have substantial impacts on the future as well, it seems
possible that "seeing a large amount of value in future generations" and
"seeing an overwhelming amount of value in future generations" lead to
similar consequences for our actions. Catastrophic risk reduction vs.
doing tangible good Many people have cited "Astronomical Waste" to me as
evidence that the greatest opportunities for doing good are in the form
of reducing the risks of catastrophes such as extreme climate change,
pandemics, problematic developments related to artificial intelligence,
etc. Indeed, "Astronomical Waste" seems to argue something like this:
For standard utilitarians, priority number one, two, three and four
should consequently be to reduce existential risk. The utilitarian
imperative "Maximize expected aggregate utility!" can be simplified to
the maxim "Minimize existential risk!". I have always found this
inference flawed, and in my recent discussion with Eliezer Yudkowsky and
Luke Muehlhauser, it was argued to me that the "Astronomical Waste"
essay never meant to make this inference in the first place. The
author's definition of existential risk includes anything that stops
humanity far short of realizing its full potential - including,
presumably, stagnation in economic and technological progress leading to
a long-lived but limited civilization. Under that definition,
"[[Minimize existential]{.mark} risk!" [would]{.mark} seem to
potentially **[include any contribution to general human
empowerment]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I have often been challenged to
explain how [one could]{.underline} possibly [reconcile]{.underline} (a)
[caring a great deal about the far future with]{.underline} (b)
[donating to one of GiveWell's top charities]{.underline}. My general
response is that [in the face of sufficient uncertainty about one's
options, and lack of conviction that there are good]{.underline} (in the
sense of high expected value) [opportunities to make an enormous
difference,]{.underline} [it is rational to try to make a smaller but
robustly positive difference, whether or not one can trace a specific
causal pathway from doing this small amount of good to making a large
impact on the far future]{.underline}. A few brief arguments in support
of this position: I believe that [[the track record of]{.mark} "[taking
robustly strong opportunities to do 'something good']{.mark} " **[is far
better]{.mark}** [than]{.mark} the track record of "[taking
actions]{.mark} whose value is **[contingent on high-uncertainty
arguments]{.mark}** about where the highest utility lies, and/or
arguments about what is likely to happen in the far
future]{.underline}." This is true even when one evaluates track record
only in terms of seeming impact on the far future. The [[developments
that seem most positive in retrospect]{.underline}]{.mark} - from large
ones like the development of the steam engine to small ones like the
many economic contributions that facilitated strong overall growth -
seem to [[have been **driven by the former
approach**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [I'm not aware of many examples in
which the latter approach has yielded great benefits]{.underline}. I see
some sense in which [the world's overall civilizational ecosystem seems
to have done a better job optimizing for the far future than any of the
world's individual minds]{.underline}. It's often the case that [people
acting on relatively short-term, tangible considerations]{.underline}
(especially when they did so with creativity, integrity, transparency,
consensuality, and pursuit of gain via value creation rather than value
transfer) [have done good in ways they themselves **wouldn't have been
able to foresee**]{.underline}. If this is correct, it seems to imply
that [one should be focused on "playing one's role as well as
possible]{.underline}" - on finding opportunities to "beat the broad
market" (to do more good than people with similar goals would be able
to) [rather than pouring one's resources into the areas that non-robust
estimates]{.underline} have indicated as most important to the far
future. The process of [[trying to accomplish tangible good can lead to
a great deal of learning and unexpected positive developments]{.mark}**,
[more so]{.mark}**]{.underline} (in my view) **[[than the process of
putting resources into a low-feedback endeavor]{.underline}]{.mark}**
based on one's current best-guess theory. In my conversation with Luke
and Eliezer, the two of them hypothesized that the greatest positive
benefit of supporting GiveWell's top charities may have been to raise
the profile, influence, and learning abilities of GiveWell. If this were
true, I don't believe it would be an inexplicable stroke of luck for
donors to top charities; rather, it would be the sort of development
(facilitating feedback loops that lead to learning, organizational
development, growing influence, etc.) that is often associated with
"doing something well" as opposed to "doing the most worthwhile thing
poorly." I see multiple reasons to believe that contributing to general
human empowerment mitigates global catastrophic risks. I laid some of
these out in a blog post and discussed them further in my conversation
with Luke and Eliezer. For one who accepts these considerations, it
seems to me that: It is not clear whether placing enormous value on the
far future ought to change one's actions from what they would be if one
simply placed large value on the far future. In both cases, [attempts to
reduce global catastrophic risks and otherwise plan for far-off events
must be weighed against attempts to do tangible good, and the question
of which has more potential to shape the far future will often be a
difficult one to answer.]{.underline} If one sees few robustly good
opportunities to "make a huge difference to the far future," [[the best
approach to making a positive far-future difference may be]{.mark}
"**[make a small but robustly positive difference to the
present]{.mark}."** One ought to be interested in "unusual, outstanding
opportunities to do good" even if they don't have a clear connection to
improving the far future]{.underline}.

#### Extinction first logic is [infinitely regressive]{.underline}; gets weaponized against solutions to probabilistic harms.

**Kessler, 8**---Oliver; April 2008; PhD in IR, professor of sociology
at the University of Bielefeld, and professor of history and theory of
IR at the Faculty of Arts; (Alternatives, Vol. 33, "From Insecurity to
Uncertainty: Risk and the Paradox of Security Politics" p. 211-232,
//GrRv)

The problem of the second method is that it is very difficult to
\"calculate\" politically unacceptable losses. [[If]{.underline}]{.mark}
the **[[risk]{.underline}]{.mark}** of terrorism [[is
defined]{.underline}]{.mark} in traditional terms
[[by]{.underline}]{.mark} probability and [[potential loss]{.mark},
[then]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[focus on dramatic]{.underline}]{.mark}
terror [[attacks leads to]{.underline}]{.mark} **[the [marginalization
of probabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} The reason is that
[even the [**highest degree of improbability** becomes **irrelevant** as
the measure of loss goes to **infinity**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\^o The
**[mathematical [calculation]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}of the risk
of terrorism thus [[tends to overestimate]{.underline}]{.mark} and to
dramatize the [[danger]{.underline}]{.mark}. This has consequences
beyond the actual risk assessment for the formulation and execution of
\"risk policies\": [[If one factor]{.underline}]{.mark} of the risk
calculation [[approaches **infinity**]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g., if a
case of nuclear terrorism is envisaged), then there is no balanced
measure for antiterrorist efforts, and [[risk management]{.mark} as a
**rational endeavor [breaks down]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Under the
historical condition of bipolarity, the \"ultimate\" threat with nuclear
weapons could be balanced by a similar counterthreat, and new equilibria
could be achieved, albeit on higher levels of nuclear overkill. Under
the new condition of uncertainty, no such rational balancing is possible
since knowledge about actors, their motives and capabilities, is largely
absent. The second form of security policy that emerges when the
deterrence model collapses mirrors the \"social probability\" approach.
It represents a logic of catastrophe. In contrast to risk management
framed in line with logical probability theory, [the **logic of
catastrophe** does not attempt to provide means of **absorbing
uncertainty**]{.underline}. [Rather, it takes uncertainty as
constitutive for the logic itself; uncertainty is a crucial precondition
for catastrophes]{.underline}. In particular, catastrophes happen at
once, without a warning, but with major implications for the world
polity. In this category, we find the impact of meteorites. Mars
attacks, the tsunami in South East Asia, and 9/11. [To conceive of
terrorism as catastrophe has consequences for the formulation of an
adequate security policy]{.underline}. Since catastrophes hap-pen
irrespectively of human activity or inactivity, no political action
could possibly prevent them. Of course, there are precautions that can
be taken, but [the framing of terrorist attack as a catastrophe points
to spatial and temporal characteristics that are beyond
\"rationality]{.underline}.\" Thus, political decision makers are
exempted from the responsibility to provide security---as long as they
at least try to preempt an attack. Interestingly enough, 9/11 was framed
as catastrophe in various commissions dealing with the question of who
was responsible and whether it could have been prevented. This makes
clear that under the condition of uncertainty, there are no objective
criteria that could serve as an anchor for measuring dangers and
assessing the quality of political responses. For ex- ample, as much as
one might object to certain measures by the US administration, it is
almost impossible to \"measure\" the success of countermeasures. Of
course, there might be a subjective assessment of specific shortcomings
or failures, but there is no \"common\" currency to evaluate them. As a
consequence, the framework of the security dilemma fails to capture the
basic uncertainties. Pushing the door open for the security paradox, the
main problem of security analysis then becomes the question how to
integrate dangers in risk assessments and security policies about which
simply nothing is known. In the mid 1990s, a Rand study entitled \"New
Challenges for Defense Planning\" addressed this issue arguing that
\"most striking is the fact that we do not even know who or what will
constitute the most serious future threat, \"\^i In order to cope with
this challenge it would be essential, another Rand researcher wrote, to
break free from the \"tyranny\" of plausible scenario planning. The
decisive step would be to create \"discontinuous scenarios \... in which
there is no plausible audit trail or storyline from current events\"52
These nonstandard scenarios were later called \"wild cards\" and became
important in the current US strategic discourse. They justified the
transformation from a threat-based toward a capability- based defense
planning strategy.53 The problem with this kind of risk assessment is,
however, that **[[even the most absurd scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark}**
can **[[gain plausibility]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [By constructing a
**chain of potentialities,** improbable events are **linked** and
brought into the realm of the possible, if not even the
probable]{.underline}. \"[[Although the likelihood of the scenario
dwindles]{.mark} with each step, [the residual impression is one of
**plausibility**]{.mark}]{.underline}. \"54 This so-called Othello
effect has been effective in the dawn of the recent war in Iraq. The
connection between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda that the US government
tried to prove was disputed from the very beginning. False evidence was
again and again presented and refuted, but this did not prevent the
administration from presenting as the main rationale for war the
improbable yet possible connection between Iraq and the terrorist
network and the improbable yet possible proliferation of an improbable
yet possible nuclear weapon into the hands of Bin Laden. As Donald
Rumsfeld famously said: \"Absence of evidence is not evidence of
absence.\" This sentence indicates that under the condition of genuine
uncertainty, different evidence criteria prevail than in situations
where security problems can be assessed with relative certainty.

Here is deadly sin number 7 in its most blatant form, in that [our
**judgment of probability** allows itself to be influenced by
**fictions**, including scenarios that we know to be the fruit of **pure
invention**]{.underline}. I call this the Othello effect. You may
remember that the lustful and thwarted Iago sets out to make Othello
believe his beloved wife, Desdemona, is unfaithful to him. Iago makes up
a scenario involving Desdemona's handkerchief. This plausible but
fallacious scenario convinces Othello of Desdemona's betrayal, and in a
fury of passion, Othello kills her. Such fictitious scenarios can be
taken advantage of by any shrewd and unscrupulous Iago. But before we
seek to save Desdemona, let us go back a few years to when [Tversky and
Kahneman **ran their experiment** on the Polish situation]{.underline}.
Let's imagine a much stranger possibility than the withdrawal of the
U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union. [**[How likely]{.mark} do you think
[it is]{.mark}** that [the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [might
invade Poland]{.mark}?]{.underline} Here [the [chances
are]{.mark}]{.underline} in the order of [**[one in a million]{.mark} or
less**. But supposing we ask our **respondents to consider** the
following sequence of events]{.underline} (you have to think yourself
back into those times): [Strikes in **Poland intensify**; crowds **are
fired on**; Lech Walensa is **imprisoned**; the pope goes to Warsaw on a
peace mission and is arrested; world public opinion is inflamed; the
**U**nited **S**tates sends a **specialist force to free the Pope**...
[As the narrative unfolds one]{.mark} [event is **linked with
another**]{.mark}, [making]{.mark} for [a script that **seems
plausible**]{.mark}]{.underline}---[always admitting]{.underline}, of
course, [that each stage has]{.underline} really [been **preceded by
another**.]{.underline} In the end, don't we think that the probability
of a U.S. invasion is somewhat higher than one in a million? Here [[we
**leave**]{.mark} [**statistics** behind]{.mark} and enter the domain of
**pure fiction**]{.underline}. Look a bit closer, and one can see that
we are not yet out of the realm of cognitive science, for these
questionaire-[**[experiments]{.mark}**, just like real life,
[have]{.mark} countless times [shown]{.mark} us that [a
plausible]{.mark} and **well-told [story]{.mark}** [can lead us]{.mark}
[to hold]{.mark} as "objectively" [probable events]{.mark} that, just
minutes before, [we would]{.mark} have [consider]{.mark}]{.underline}ed
**[totally [improbable]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The notorious "Protocols
of Zion," a pure fabrication of the czar's anti-Semitic propaganda taken
up by the Nazi regime raised an Anti-Semitic storm. It did little good
to show that it was a pure invention. What the propagandists sought to
do, in order to seize power, [was to make **imaginatively presentable**
the probability of a **worldwide Jewish conspiracy**, and]{.underline}
in doing so they [succeeded]{.underline} admirably, at least [in the
minds of those **uncritically committed to hatred**.]{.underline} I will
not waste space on other instances, but limit myself to the purely
cognitive aspects of the phenomenon. [[Offering **a**]{.mark}
**"plausible" [sequence]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} [events]{.mark} that are
**[causally linked]{.mark}** one to another [has]{.mark} the [effect
of]{.mark} **immediately [raising]{.mark} our [estimate]{.mark}** [of
probability]{.mark}]{.underline}. It suffices that the [links between
these "events" should hold from one to **the next for our minds** to
approach the final link in the chain]{.underline}. For, as we have seen,
[that which we can]{.underline} [**readily imagine** is ipso facto
**more probable**. [Even if]{.mark} the [probability of **the**]{.mark}
**very [first link]{.mark}** in this chain [is]{.mark} very [low, the
fact is]{.mark} soon [forgotten]{.mark}]{.underline}. Say "Let's suppose
that..." and we're off, [putting together **a series of
consequences**]{.underline}, all of them **["plausible"
enough]{.underline}**. I put "plausible" in quotation marks because true
plausibility, in effect, depends wholly on that initial "Let's
suppose..." Once the first link in the chain of our script is
"supposed," then all [the rest of the **links "hold" one to
another**.]{.underline} Rationally speaking, however, and having regard
to the calculation of probabilities, [we are in **the domain**
of]{.underline} what is known as **["compound
probabilities,"]{.underline}**, or, more restrictively, ["conditional
probabilities."]{.underline} (What is the likelihood that B will be
true, supposing that A has to be true?) [The [probability]{.mark} of the
**last link in the chain** being true [is calculated on]{.mark} the
basis of a series of [conditional **probabilities**]{.mark} **being
true**, and that in turn is obtained by **combining** the
**probabilities** of each link in the chain, from **the first to the
last**. Probabilities being]{.underline}, by their nature, [less than
one, the probability of the entire chain]{.underline} (or the last link)
[being true is]{.underline} **[always]{.underline}** *and without
exception* [less probable than the probability of the least **probable
link in the chain**. We fail to notice this **progressive attenuation**
of probability.]{.underline} **[The [story takes
over]{.mark}]{.underline}** from reality. [The **[last link
seems]{.mark} ever [truer]{.mark}** to our mind, and our **increased
facility** in representing or imaging makes that last link **seem ever
more probable**. The trick---which is **one of the oldest** in the
book---is to find the narrative path by **which the last, and most
implausible**, link can be **made imaginatively
compelling**]{.underline}. My Othello effect depends on this perverse
use of the imagination. If by chance one or two of the intervening links
in this chain should come true, then poor Desdemona will indeed die. [A
narrative chain]{.underline} put together with art by some cunning Iago,
and "resting" [on a pair of **intermediate links** that come
true]{.underline} (though only true for quite different reasons, and for
reasons that no one may know), [becomes **irresistible**]{.underline}.
Poor us! [The narrative then **becomes a**]{.underline}n [**impregnable
"logical"** demonstration]{.underline}. Iago can transform doubt into
certainty. Iago is not acting in good faith, and Othello, truth to tell,
is no Sherlock Holmes. A rational, rigorously deductive man, knows
perfectly well that the deductive inferences Iago makes about
Desdemona's fidelity don't amount to much. His "indications," hints, and
"proofs"could all be explained without the infidelity hypothesis. Bayes'
law, or for that matter any sensible use of compound probability
calculations, can save Desdemona from a horrible and unjust fate.
Instead, [[reinforced by]{.mark} our **cognitive
[illusions]{.mark}**]{.underline} and dark passions, [by a **single
imaginary chain** of "plausibilities,"]{.underline} and by a pair of
intermediate links that for totally unrelated reasons are true,
Desdemona's tragic death is set into motion. The [implausible becomes
plausible]{.underline}, indeed certain. [[Give us **a**]{.mark} **little
[story]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a script, something born of our own
imagination, [[and]{.mark} **our own [natural]{.mark}
[tendencies]{.mark}**, cognitive or emotional, [do the
rest]{.mark}]{.underline}. Isn't this really the deadliest of our deadly
sins?

[[A]{.mark}nother [major difference]{.mark} between now and 100 years
ago [is the presence of **nuclear weapons**, which]{.mark}, as during
the Cold War, generally [serve as a **brake on major** ]{.mark}**power
[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is noteworthy here that [both key
emerging powers, including China and India, and established powers such
as the US, France and the UK, possess **nuclear arsenals.**]{.underline}

A further fundamental change is that, unlike in 1914, [[there is]{.mark}
now [a **dense web of**]{.mark} **post-war [international
institutions]{.mark}**[, especially the **UN**, which]{.mark} continue
to [have **significant resilience** and **legitimacy**]{.mark} decades
after their creation]{.underline}. While these bodies are imperfect, and
in need of reform, the fact remains that [[they have]{.mark} generally
[enabled **international security**]{.mark}, especially with five of the
key powers all on the UN Security Council.]{.underline}

Moreover, the relative balance between the two leading powers today is
different today from a century ago. That is, **[the gap between the US
and China is greater today than that between the UK and Germany 100
years ago.]{.underline}**

[Perhaps the biggest consequence of the First World War was the dawn of
the "American Century," in which the US emerged as the world's most
powerful nation]{.underline}. To be sure, the country has undergone
relative decline, and China is now the largest economy in the world
based on purchasing power parity data.

However, [the US remains **significantly ahead** of China on most
measures of national strength, including military might, and is likely
to enjoy an overall advantage for years]{.underline}. Indeed, unlike the
UK in the 20th century, there are indications that **[US power may
remain resilient for decades to come, buoyed by factors such as the
country's "energy revolution,"]{.underline}** which has potentially
far-reaching geopolitical consequences.

[Taken overall, [the prospect of a **major power war**]{.mark} in the
foreseeable future [is not]{.mark} as [high]{.mark} as a century ago.
[The]{.mark} relative [global balance of power is different
today]{.mark}, partly because of the resilience of US
power]{.underline}**.** [Moreover, [**nuclear weapons** and
**international institutions**]{.mark} that did not exist 100 years ago
generally [act as a **restraining force**]{.mark} against major
conflict.]{.underline}

[Trump's **Unpredictability** Deters Rival Risk-Taking]{.underline}

That Schelling's logic applies equally well to President Trump's
dealings with America's opponents has already been pointed out by other
commentators. They have referred to Nixon's madman theory of
negotiation, which holds that [[America's opponents will **tread more**
carefully]{.mark} [if they perceive the president to be
unpredictable]{.mark}]{.underline} or ~~crazy~~. It has been debated at
some length whether Trump is using this theory in a rational manner to
extract concessions from U.S. adversaries, or if he is "a madman in
practice." Regardless, the point is that President [Trump's
unpredictability makes it next to **impossible** to **calculate the risk
of escalation** involved in challenging the United States
militarily]{.underline}, a concept also highlighted by Schelling.
President [[Obama's **reluctance**]{.underline}]{.mark} to threaten and
use force likely [[**emboldened** China and Russia to take **greater
military risks**]{.underline}]{.mark} in Eastern Ukraine, Syria, and in
the East and South China Seas. [While Beijing and Moscow could be fairly
confident that Obama would not take military counter-measures, they have
**no way of knowing** what President **Trump** might do]{.underline}. It
is very easy to imagine him giving the order to down a Chinese or
Russian plane to demonstrate that "America is great again."

In this way, [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} (intentionally or not)
**[[reduces the risk of military confrontations]{.underline}]{.mark}**
with China and Russia. [[This gives]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[states
**greater incentive** to prioritize diplomacy over
coercion]{.underline}]{.mark} in their efforts to settle disputes with
the United States and its allies. Similarly, [Trump's characterization
of the nuclear agreement with Iran as "the worst deal ever negotiated"
gives Tehran strong incentive to honor it in both letter and spirit for
fear of a potentially **much worse alternative if it
collapses**]{.underline}. Some are deeply worried that Trump versus Kim
Jong-un will prove a highly explosive combination, which is
understandable since North Korea has employing the same negotiating
tactics as Trump for decades with considerable success. While the
outcome of this confrontation is difficult to call, the disastrous
consequences of war are likely to lead to mutual restraint. [Moreover,
concern about what Trump might do will **induce Beijing** to **redouble
its efforts** to persuade Pyongyang to be **less
provocative.**]{.underline}

Good News for World Peace

Paradoxically, [[Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark} tweets and the
[[theatrics]{.underline}]{.mark} are most likely to **[[enhance world
peace]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [They create unpredictability and anxiety
that the United States can **use** to obtain **greater concessions from
friends and foes**]{.underline}. It is admittedly still early days, but
all indications are that Trump will succeed in coercing his allies in
both Asia and Europe to increase their defense spending significantly.
Few of them will reach 2 percent of GDP in the next year or two, but he
has set in motion a process that will make most allies spend far more
much faster than they otherwise would have[. His unpredictability is
also an asset in America's dealings with its opponents such as [China,
Iran, North Korea, and Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. They
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} all need to [[**think twice** about
provoking the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} and its allies
militarily [[because they have **no way of calculating**
how]{.underline}]{.mark} President **[[Trump will
react]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Neither friends nor foes can be certain
that Trump will not do something that a rational cost-benefit
calculating actor would not]{.underline}. U.S. allies used to regard
American threats to withdraw its forces as bluff because the costs of
doing so would be prohibitive, and the same logic has induced American
opponents to engage in military risk-taking with little fear of U.S.
military retaliation. With Trump in the White House, this logic no
longer applies. [This is **good news** because [the]{.mark} likely
[result is **strengthened U.S. alliance**s]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. [[opponents]{.underline}]{.mark} that
are [[**more likely** to favor **negotiation** over
**provocation**]{.underline}]{.mark} in their efforts to settle
differences with the United States and its allies.

When the president wakes up the military It is a different matter in the
other context: [when it is the president who **wakes up the military**
and tries to get them to go from **peacetime** to **war**]{.underline},
i.e. to launch [[a **preventive nuclear attack**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
In the preventive case, it is not reasonable to believe that the
streamlined procedures of an emergency response would operate without
anyone raising objections. The steps the president would have to take in
order to pass a nuclear order to someone who could physically launch the
missiles would simultaneously alert the rest of his national security
team. Efforts to bypass the senior leadership
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} themselves further **[[alarm
subordinates]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [**increasing the likelihood** that
they would draw in the **rest of the national security**
**team**]{.underline}, even if ordered not to. [[The military is
**trained** to reject illegal orders]{.underline}]{.mark} and the
president trying to order the military to go from peacetime to nuclear
war [[without consulting]{.underline}]{.mark} with his national security
[**[advisors]{.underline}** [would **set off
alarms**]{.underline}]{.mark} up and down the system about whether the
orders were legal. [[The president]{.underline}]{.mark} does not need
anyone else to help him fire off a tweet, but he does [[need **many
others** to help him fire]{.underline}]{.mark} [off a nuclear
**intercontinental ballistic missile**]{.underline}. If he were trying
to do so [it would take an **enormous effort of
persuasion**]{.underline} that would involve many more people than are
involved in the streamlined, launch-under-attack scenario. What would
happen in this second scenario? That question led to the second major
topic of concern in the Q&A period: how robust is the military training
to resist illegal orders and how confident could we be that the Pentagon
would view an order to "launch a preventive nuclear war without
notifying my national security team" to be illegal? In testimony,
General Kehler repeatedly emphasized that [[the military **does not
follow orders \[ignorantly\]**]{.mark}]{.underline} ~~blindly~~ and the
ubiquity of lawyers at multiple layers of command gives us high
confidence the [[legal questions would be asked]{.underline}]{.mark}
(and need to be answered) before a nuclear strike actually happened.
This is true, though it is also true that the military are trained that
authenticated orders from the national command authority have a
presumption of legality. (Note: the presumption is even stronger in
launch-under-attack scenarios, because the United States has long
embraced the legal concept of anticipatory self-defense, which could
result in a decision to strike under circumstances where the United
States has not yet suffered an attack, but one is deemed to be imminent
or even underway.) Nevertheless, I am inclined to share General Kehler's
confidence that [[a **rogue president** would find
it]{.underline}]{.mark} exceedingly [[**hard** to **persuade the
military to act**]{.underline}]{.mark} in preventive war scenarios as
**[[rapidly]{.underline}]{.mark}** as they are trained to act in
launch-under-attack scenarios. Part of this comes from my understanding
of the civil-military context of national security. [Presidents
**already** find it **challenging** to persuade the military to embrace
policies that the **military object to** --- and which are **far less
consequential than preventive nuclear war.**]{.underline} Another of my
books, Armed Servants, explores in some detail the push and shove of
civil-military relations. And still a third (co-authored with Chris
Gelpi), Choosing Your Battles, shows that [the military are **hardly
chomping** at the bit to initiate the use of force]{.underline}. To be
sure, I also found, in Guarding the Guardians, that the military did
favor a system inclined to the always rather than the never side of the
always/never dilemma. This is in part why U.S. political leaders
insisted that there be civilian control of the arsenal. Yet all of these
policies were the result of a lengthy bureaucratic struggle that
involved many more people than just the president and the few nuclear
operators required to launch a missile. The longer timeline of a
preventive war scenario gives the opportunity for all these actors to
weigh in on the president's decision. Yes, the president could still
carry the day, as President George W. Bush did in 2003 when he ordered
the invasion of Iraq in a similar preventive scenario. But [Bush's team
spent **over a year** debating the decision. The military weighed in
repeatedly. And, crucially, **Congress** voted to give the president the
**authority** to do what he did.]{.underline}

But [the idea that poverty and peace are directly related presupposes
that wealth inequalities are]{.underline} -- in and of themselves --
[unjust, and that the solution to the problem of war is to
alleviate]{.underline} the injustice that inspires conflict, namely
[poverty.]{.underline} However, it also suggests that poverty is a
legitimate inspiration for violence, otherwise there would be no reason
to alleviate it in the interests of peace. It has become such a
commonplace to suggest that poverty and conflict are linked that **[it
rarely suffers any examination]{.underline}**. To suggest [[that war
causes poverty]{.underline} [is]{.underline}]{.mark} to utter [**[an
obvious truth,]{.underline}** [but]{.underline}]{.mark} to suggest [[the
opposite is]{.underline}]{.mark} -- on reflection -- [quite **[hard to
believe.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[War is]{.mark} an [expensive]{.mark}
business]{.underline} in the twenty-first century, [even
asymmetrically.]{.underline} And just to examine Bangladesh for a moment
is enough at least to raise the question concerning the actual
connection between peace and poverty. The government of Bangladesh is a
threat only to itself, and despite 30 years of the Grameen Bank,
Bangladesh remains in a state of incipient civil strife. So although
Muhammad Yunus should be applauded for his work in demonstrating the
efficacy of micro-credit strategies in a context of development, it is
not at all clear that this has anything to do with resolving the social
and political crisis in Bangladesh, nor is it clear that this has
anything to do with resolving [the problem of peace and war]{.underline}
in our times. It does speak to the Western liberal mindset -- as Geir
Lundestad acknowledges -- but then perhaps this exposes the extent to
which [the Peace Prize itself has simply become]{.underline} an award
that reflects a degree of [Western liberal wish-fulfilment]{.underline}.
[[It is]{.underline}]{.mark} perhaps [[comforting to believe that
**poverty causes violence**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} [as it serves [to
endorse]{.mark}]{.underline} a particular kind of concern for the
developing world that in turn regards [[all problems as]{.mark}
fundamentally [economic rather than]{.mark} deeply -- and potentially
radically -- [political]{.mark}.]{.underline}

If true, we would have a unified theory of violence. Pinker subsequently
steps back from this expansive claim. He notes that some other forms of
violence--- including homicides, lynchings, domestic violence, and
rapes---do not fit a power law model, suggesting that the mechanisms
driving these practices differ from those driving international war.
Still, there are **[others]{.underline}** who **[have insisted on [a
unified theory of violence]{.mark}. Examples might
include]{.underline}** Freud's **[psychoanalytic theory of aggressive
instincts [as a root cause of war]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Einstein and
Freud 1933), **[frustration-aggression theory]{.underline}** (Durbin and
Bowlby 1939), **[and contemporary rational choice
theories.]{.underline}**∂ **[[We are highly
skeptical]{.underline}]{.mark}**. We fear that **[[any theory broad
enough to explain violence]{.mark} at the levels [of the individual,
family, neighborhood, communal]{.mark} group, [state, and
international]{.mark} system]{.underline}** **[[would be]{.mark} too
general and [too indiscriminating to capture variations]{.mark} in
violence within each level, [which is a prerequisite for any]{.mark}
satisfactory theoretical [explanation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[It is
difficult to]{.mark} imagine an [explan]{.mark}ation for]{.underline}**
great power war, or **[interstate [war]{.mark}]{.underline}** more
generally, **[that does [not include system-level structures of
power]{.mark} and wealth, dyadic-level [rivalries, and]{.mark} domestic
[institutions]{.mark} and processes]{.underline}**. All but the latter
contribute little if anything to an explanation of homicides and
domestic violence.∂ **[It is not even clear whether different kinds of
organized warfare]{.underline}**---hegemonic wars, interstate wars,
colonial wars, and civil wars---**[can be explained with a single
theory]{.underline}**. In fact, [the theoretical literature on
interstate war and civil war remains for the most part two distinct
literatures, with little overlap]{.underline} in their respective
analyses of the causes of war.9 Exceptions include the concept of the
security dilemma (Posen 1993; Snyder and Jervis 1999) and the
increasingly influential bargaining model of war (Fearon 1995), which
cut across both literatures.∂ **[International relations scholars are
even divided on the question of whether different kinds of interstate
wars can be subsumed under a single theory]{.underline}**. A 1990
symposium addressed the questions of whether big wars and small wars had
similar causes and whether a single theory could account for both.10
Whereas Bueno de Mesquita (1990) argued that an expected utility
framework can explain all kinds of wars, Thompson (1990) argued that
system-level structures of power and wealth differentiate big wars from
small wars.11 The closely related question of whether the outbreak and
spread (expansion) of war are driven by the same or different variables
and processes was the subject of another recent symposium (Vasquez,
Diehl, Flint, and Scheffran 2011).∂ **[Our
[skepticism]{.mark}]{.underline}** about the utility **[of a unified
theory of violence]{.underline}** or war [[is reinforced by]{.mark} the
[systematic and rigorous evidence]{.mark} Pinker provides [about]{.mark}
the trends in different forms of [violence over time.]{.mark} As his
detailed **and informative graphs make clear**]{.underline}, [different
forms of human [violence began to decline at different times]{.mark} and
proceeded [at different rates]{.mark}]{.underline}.12 **[Many of the
trends are not monotonic and sometimes point in different
directions]{.underline}**. The gradual decline in the frequency of great
power war was interrupted in the first half of the twentieth century but
then continued from 1950s to the present, while the frequency of civil
wars began to increase significantly after 1960 before beginning an
uneven decline by 1990 that included an uptick in the early 2000s. **[It
is clear that [great power wars and civil wars follow different
trajectories]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,13 [undercutting
any]{.underline}]{.mark} [claim that a [single process]{.mark} could
drive these different patterns (unless those processes are defined so
generally as to lose their analytic utility]{.underline}).

### Structural Violence\-\--AT: War Trades Off

**Discussion of war doesn't displace focus on structural violence -- it
allows an [injection of complexity]{.underline}\-\--structural violence
isn't the root cause of war AND war turns it.**

(Tarak, "Of Camps and Critiques: A Reply to \'Security, War, Violence\'"

**[A]{.underline}** final **[totalising move]{.underline}** in
'Security, War, Violence' **[is the idea]{.underline}** that the study
of war should be subsumed under the category of 'violence'. The reasons
offered for this are: violence does not entail a hierarchy in which war
is privileged; **[a focus on violence]{.underline}** encourages us to
see war in relational terms and **[makes visible other kinds of violence
besides that of war]{.underline}**; [and that the analysis of violence
somehow enables the disentangling of politics from war and a proper
critique of liberal violence]{.underline}.22 [I have **no particular
objection** to the study of violence, and I certainly think **there
should be more of it** in the social sciences]{.underline}. **[However,
why and how this obviates or subsumes the study of war is obscure to me.
Is war not historically significant enough to justify inquiry into it?
War is a more specific category relative to violence in
general]{.underline}**, referring to reciprocal organised violence
between political entities. **[[I make no claims that the study of war
should be privileged over]{.mark} that of [other]{.mark} forms of
[violence]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Both the violence of war, and that
of,]{.underline}** say, **[patriarchy, demand scholarly attention, but
they are also distinct]{.underline}** if related topics requiring
different forms of theorisation and inquiry. As for relationality, the
category of war is already inherently relational; one does not need the
concept of violence in general to see this. **[What]{.underline}**
precisely **[distinguishes war from]{.underline}** many **[other kinds
of violence]{.underline}**, such as genocide or massacre, **[is that
[war is a relational form of violence in which the other side shoots
back]{.mark}. [This is ultimately the source of war's generative social
powers]{.mark}]{.underline}**, for it is amidst the clash of arms that
the truths which define social and political orders are brought into
question. **[[A broader focus on violence in general risks losing this
central]{.mark}, [distinctive character of the violence of
war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Is it really more theoretically or
politically adequate to start referring to the Second World War as an
instance of 'violence'? Equally, while I am all for the analysis of
liberal violence, another broad category which would include issues of
'structural violence', I also think **[[we have far from exhausted the
subject of]{.mark} liberalism and [war]{.mark}, an important area of
inquiry]{.underline}** now dominated by the mostly self-serving nostrums
of the liberal peace debates. What perhaps is most interesting about
Aradau's remarks on violence is that she assumes we know what war is.
So, for example, she suggests that we attend to a continuum of violence
in which war is considered alongside 'insurrections, revolts,
revolutions, insurgencies, rebellions, seditions, disobediences, riots
and uprisings'.23 Apparently, on her understanding, these other things
are not war, even though most of them typically involve reciprocal,
organised violence. This is precisely to take as given the IR
disciplinary view of 'real interstate war' that underlies Correlates of
War and other mainstream work. This is the definition of war that I
sought to critique in 'From War to Security', a critique Aradau has
overlooked. I was posing new questions and possibilities for the study
of war, not proffering definitive answers about what war is and what it
is not, or about where and when it starts and ends. It is, I would
suggest, Aradau who is most concerned about hierarchy and privilege,
particularly in respect of perceived slights to Critical Security
Studies and her demand that any study of war be in dialogue with
Critical Security Studies. In this, she overlooks the fact that,
conceived another way, with a more holistic vision of the community of
relevant scholars, my article was already an engagement with critical
inquiry into security relations. Perhaps it was the opening rhetoric of
my article that inspired Aradau's ire, my reference to partygoers from
Copenhagen and Aberystwyth dancing on graves, or my suggestion that
contemporary 'wider agenda' security scholars know rather less about the
composition of carrier battle groups than did their traditional
predecessors.24 But does anyone seriously doubt that 'wider agenda'
scholars are less familiar with histories and sociologies of wars and
militaries than were the traditional predecessors, who even so still
managed to overlook their significance? [These passages were meant to
serve a very specific purpose, to denaturalise our images of the new and
old security studies, and to open up the reader to the possibility that,
with respect to [the study of war]{.mark}, these fields of study [share
more in common than is conceivable within the current terms of
debate]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Neither traditional nor]{.mark} '[wider
agenda']{.mark} [security studies are centrally interested in
war]{.mark}. Given the significance of war in the human past and
present, and the dire state of the study of war in the Anglo-American
academy, this seems to me a serious problem for critical
thought]{.underline}**.

This article's main thesis1 is that, **[[given the existence
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** at least two **[[global
threats]{.underline}]{.mark}**, nuclear weapons and climate change,
**[[which endanger]{.mark} the life of [humankind]{.mark} as a civ-
ilized species]{.underline}**, its **[[right to survive should be
asserted as its first]{.underline}]{.mark}** human or rather
**[[fundamental right]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The sense of
**[this]{.underline}** assertion **[is not just philosophical but legal
as]{.underline}** **[well]{.underline}**.¶ To substantiate this thesis,
I shall go through six argumentative steps:¶ 1. Why begin with global
threats.¶ 2. Why survival is the leading category in this field, and¶
how it interplays with justice.¶ 3. What interest humankind has in its
survival, and why¶ it should be protected as a right.¶ 4. Why regard
"humankind" rather than "all indi-¶ viduals" as a possible actor.¶ 5.
Why speak of a fundamental rather than human¶ right, and how to
constitutionalize this right.¶ 6. How two developments in international
law after 1945 can contribute to support the argument I have¶ been
sketching.¶ \*\*¶ 1. If philosophical thinking starts with being amazed
at something in the world (Plato's θαυμα ́ζειν), my in- terest in the
present matter2 was first stimulated by the pre-philosophical amazement
I always felt in seeing that in the now enormous human rights discourse
(both in politics and academia) so much care is dedicated to the single
individuals, and so wide-ranging designs of a cos- mopolis to come are
based on their rights. Yet **[[nobody seems to]{.mark} take [note that
the life of all present and futur]{.mark}e individuals [could be
annihilated]{.mark}]{.underline}** by a nuclear war or up- set by
catastrophic developments of climate change. **[It is like insisting on
first debating the rights of a ship's]{.underline}** third- class
**[passengers]{.underline}** 3 **[instead of taking action in the light
of the fact that the ship is already taking in seawater from a
leak]{.underline}** (climate change is already happening) and also risks
to hit a mine that is floating around and would send it along with all
passengers and crew straight to the ocean depths (by thinking and acting
timely, leaks can be filled, mines detected and swept away, all ac-
tions that would put the care for third-class passengers¶ on a firmer
ground). **[These dangers are philosophically significant because they
tell something about human beings]{.underline}**, the only ones who have
become able to destroy their own race, as well as about modernity: the
possibil- ity of self-destruction sets an end to this era, opens a new
one, which can only vaguely be termed post-modern,4 and requires an
updated rewriting of the Dialectics of the Enlightenment. It is also
politically significant as it challenges present politics to restructure
itself by ex- tending its attention to the far future, something which
is not possible within the boundaries of modern politics because of its
narrow time structure.5 In a more precise language, I term **[challenges
like nuclear weapons]{.underline}** (con- sidered in themselves, while
nuclear proliferation is but a subphenomenon) **[and climate
change]{.underline}** global (in a very specific sense) because they are
lethal and planet-wide, **[can hit]{.underline}** approximately
**[everybody on earth and]{.underline}** can be reasonably addressed
only by the near totality of coun- tries and peoples. They would not
wipe out biologically humankind, although this cannot be excluded in
case of an all-out nuclear war; but **[they would destroy human
civilization]{.underline}**:6 not a set of values, but the set of
material and cultural tools (agriculture, communications, trans-
portation and trade) that allow unspecialized animals like the humans to
survive and to thrive.¶ It is clear that my thesis presupposes a revised
scale of relevance among the issues requiring and stimulat- ing
theoretical investigations: in my philosophical view global threats have
a greater relevance and are intellec- tually more challenging than the
issues suggested by the media's headlines (present wars, terrorism,
group and minority rights in the US, multiculturalism in Canada or
Australia, immigrants in Europe, or, more recently, the crisis of the
global economic system). As a reflection upon the deeper longue dure ́e
determinants of human- ity's fate, political philosophy should not
necessarily espouse the agenda suggested by current politics and
journalism and, instead, seek its own independent as- sessment of the
state of the world as part of its business; this is a critical attitude
that cannot be implemented without a philosophical view on history (not
to be con- fused with a revival of the "grand narratives"). Besides,
**[the shifting of]{.underline}** most of Critical **[Theory to pure
normativity has favored]{.underline}** the emergence not just of
worldviews based on the predominance of Sollen, but also of **[an
exclusive attention on intersubjectivity]{.underline}** and its
troubles; **[as if challenges to politics and civilization caused by
systemic imperatives]{.underline}** (**[such as the nuclear threat
and]{.underline}**¶ **[climate change)]{.underline}** **[were beyond the
grasp of critical inquiry]{.underline}**. What I am attempting in this
article is to address an issue such as human rights that is typical of
**[the self- centered normative approach]{.underline}** mentioned and to
show how it **[should be restructured to address the challenges for
humankind's survival]{.underline}**.¶ In this attempt I am driven by the
intent to debunk the layer of denial (or repression in pshychoanalyti-
cal sense) that, more intensely after the end of the Cold War, has
removed the nuclear threat from the philosoph- ical reflection on
modernity and has later prevented cli- mate change from entering the
main agenda of Critical Theory. There is also an epistemological aspect
in this: a critical Zeitdiagnose, or an informed assessment of where
history has taken us to in our post-modern times is not possible without
first taking what hard science has to say about the threats for
humankind very seriously.7 With rare exceptions, **[[critical theorists
seem to be reluctant to address]{.mark} the [philosophical issues raised
by global challenges]{.mark}, not to mention their]{.underline}**
**[complete denial]{.underline}** beginning with Horkheimer and Adorno
in the Fifties and Sixties (when Mutual Assured Destruction became a
real possibility) **[of the meaning of nuclear weapons. It is as if
Critical Theory]{.underline}**, despite its claim to be a gen- eral
assessment of our civilization, **[had accepted a tacit division of
labor in which its competence is restricted to social
justice]{.underline}** (in continuation of its original being rooted in
the Marxian critique of political economy) **[and the
"damaged"]{.underline}**8 **[subjectivity]{.underline}**. The rest of
the real world is left to a purely Hobbesian (and later Luhmannian)
reading, or to the perception of side-figures such as Karl Jaspers or Gu
̈nther Anders.¶ A last epistemological remark: **[starting from problems
and threats that]{.underline}**, however socially generated, **[come up
as physical events and are accounted for by hard science has the
advantage that philosophy can work on them without first engaging in a
complicate and doubt- ful theorizing about how the world should be
reshaped]{.underline}** according to a general normative theory. This ad
hoc theorizing shows the ability or inability of a philosoph- ical view
to come to terms with problems that are of paramount importance to
everybody, not just to the prac- titioners of Schulphilosophie.¶ 2. I
have explained elsewhere9why survival rather than justice is the leading
category of a philosophy of global threats. **[The]{.underline}** now
thriving **[[literature on justice]{.mark} and climate change [misses
the point]{.mark}]{.underline}** that before we look for ways to
establish justice between generations, **[[we have to motivate our
interest in]{.underline}]{.mark}** their
**[[existence]{.underline}]{.mark}** and wellbeing, or rather in the
existence and wellbeing of humankind.10 While survival of humankind is
what best defines our problematic situation, when it comes to the
normative aspect I believe that **[[we should assume responsibility for
future generations]{.underline}]{.mark}** rather than do justice to
them; talking responsibility I move from its most elementary¶
manifestation, the responsibility parents take on for their children.
Justice as fairness comes in when we have to fight back "generational
nepotism:" it is wrong for any generation to spoil the environment
without regard to the consequences in the future, far that it may be,
that is not just out of respect for those that may harm our children and
children's children. Out of elementary fairness, as expressed in the
Golden Rule, we cannot deny parents of the, say, twenty-fifth century
the chance to bear and educate their children in decent conditions.¶
Now, survival is a Hobbesian category, as such it sounds like an
anathema to critical thinking, just as most categories stemming from the
tradition of politi- cal realism do. Since under global threats present
and future humankind is really endangered in its survival, it is however
hard to see the rationale of denying the fact because the name comes
from the enemy's vocabu- lary. More importantly, there is an essential
difference: Hobbes' survival regards the individual and is there- fore
self-centered and adversarial (in common parlance, mors tua vita mea),
while humankind's survival as a moral and political goal is by its own
definition an uni- versalistic feature. More on this later.¶ A much
talked-about issue in this context is the so- called identity problem,
which I am however inclined to dismiss. If it means the doubtfulness of
any engagement in favor of future generations because we do not know if
they will exist (we could decide to stop procreating), the problem is
surrounded by an air of futility: there is no imaginable decision
process that could effectively lead to a total procreation stop. On the
other hand, if only a few humans were alive in the far future, this
would be enough of a reason for our engagement. Of course future
humanity could never be born because meanwhile the planet may have been
burnt out by an asteroid (natural precariousness of human life) or an
all-out nuclear war (man-made precariousness). Neither type of
precarious- ness can however be a reason not to endorse the interest of
future generations in survival, because reducing that precariousness is
exactly the engagement's telos. The other aspect of the identity problem
--- the non-identity of posterity's values and preferences with our own,
or their indeterminacy --- is not relevant to our case, be- cause the
goal for whose attainment we are called to save or sacrifice something
for their survival has to do with their sheer survival (in an
indispensably civilized framework, as explained above) rather than with
our own and the posterity's moral configuration; in other words, there
is no paternalistic attitude in it.¶ In a fairly different meaning,
closer to social rather than moral (analytical) theory, identity comes
up in an- other sense. Assuming responsibility for (or, for that matter,
being fair to) future generations is not just an altruistic attitude.
Not in the sense that we can do as well do so by acting on egoistic
grounds: were this the¶ main reason to take action, we were justified to
limit our effort to the less costly adaptation policies instead of
funding the restructuring of the economy necessary for mitigation, the
only way-out from global warming for generations of the far future. To
be true, addressing the limitation of global warming or the
neutralization of nuclear weapons requires wide-ranging undertakings
that can be justified only on grounds of a moral attitude towards future
generations rather than of our enlight- ened self-interest. [But
**[doing what we can for the survival]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[of
humankind [can give ourselves reassurance that]{.mark} our individual
[life]{.mark}]{.underline}** (also seen in the context of our gen-
eration's) **[[is meaningful]{.underline}]{.mark}** beyond the limits of
our own existence on earth, **[because doing so helps us shed our
isolation as single individuals or single generation and become partners
in a wider transgenerational covenant of solidarity]{.underline}**.¶ 3.
That the interest to live and to raise children in de- cent conditions
we attribute to future generations ought to be translated into a right
is not self-evident. It is not simply that we should abstain from
transforming every reasonable claim into a right, and instead reserve
this category for the essentials that make the associated life of
individuals in the polity possible and acceptable ac- cording to each
evolutionary stage.11 More importantly, doubts may also arise as to
whether it is wise to translate any goal of social and political
struggles into a right, that is to "juridify" it instead of focusing on
the underlying conflict dynamics and the participation of the conflict-
ing parties. In general I share this preoccupation, and have misgivings
at any inflationary expansion of the hu- man rights catalogue. On the
other hand, moral rights that do not translate into legal rights12 are
politically pointless or at least much less significant than the rights
enshrined in a legal order. Also, our case is different, and the issues
we are confronted with are more radi- cal than the worries with
'juridification;' this is all the truer, since the establishment of a
right to survival for humankind would require a long and fierce
political and intellectual battle in the first place.¶ First of all,
does the right of humanity to survival qualify as a (basic or human)
right? Before we proceed, let us note that humankind's survival is not a
good like civil liberties, which is completely at the disposal of human
beings; instead, it can depend on the orbits of asteroids and other
NEOs.13 The "right of humankind to survival" should therefore be read as
a short for "the right of humankind, including future people, to have
all previous generations doing their best to ensure their sur- vival and
protect them from man-made threats." In this version, we are clearly
afar from the confusion between rights and goals criticized by Dworkin14
(§3.1 in the chapter on Difficult cases), the causation of the good at
stake (survival) being elusive, or not completely nor (in the case of
climate change) undoubtedly human; also¶ the content of the right is not
a physical state, but rather the behavior influencing it. In a manifest
way, this also identifies the right's indispensable correlate, that is
the duty of the relevant actors (individuals and institutions) to
refrain from behaviors that are likely to cause harm to that good.¶
Whether or not this claim can translate into a right should be
investigated from two points of view, those of its structure (a) and its
bearer (b).¶ a. As for structure, three of Feinberg's15 four crite- ria
for being a right are already met (to have a content, a holder and an
addressee). The fourth, the 'source of validation,' gradually emerges
from the argument I am unfolding. Frydman and Haarscher also list four
condi- tions, of which three are already present (titulaire, objet,
opposabilite ́) -- even if more remains to be said about the first one;
while the fourth condition (sanction) shall be discussed below in the
framework of the constitu- tionalization problem.16 Finally, let us look
at the stan- dard distinction of negative and positive rights, which
Shue rightly believes to be substantially untenable. This is also true
in our case, because the 'behavior' of in- dividuals and institutions,
which humanity is entitled to expect, according to the new right, can be
imple- mented either by abstaining in single cases from using or
possessing nuclear weapons and emitting excessive GHGs or by
establishing new institutions (a global En- vironmental Protection
Agency, say) and strategies (for example, technology transfer from
advanced to develop- ing countries to help the latter rein in global
warming). What would be acknowledged would be the right, not the
policies that according to time and circumstances are devised for its
realization.¶ Does this new right share with the other fundamental or
human rights the need to be founded in a conception of the human, such
as those focused by Donnelly on dignity, by Meyers on moral agency and
by Frydman and Haarscher on autonomy?17 Not properly, or not di- rectly.
Humanity's right to survival is a meta-right rather than being the first
right and sharing the same founda- tion with the others.18 Therefore,
its foundation is for- mal rather than rooted in a substantive view of
what is human: **[acknowledging this right is the pre-condition for
making all other rights possible]{.underline}**. It is their Bedingung
der Mo ̈glichkeit, to put it as Kant might have done. Not only in the
trivial but sturdy physical sense that **[human rights can only apply to
a living humankind, but not to a "republic of insects and
grass"]{.underline}** (Jonathan Schell on the state of the earth after a
large nuclear war19). **[The meta-right as a pre-condition
has]{.underline}** rather **[to be un- derstood in the moral sense:
[no]{.mark} foundation of [morality]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}or
legality (except in a totally positivistic view of the latter) **[[makes
sense if it cannot rely on]{.mark} the respect of the [fundamental
rights]{.mark} of those]{.underline}** (poor populations al- ready
affected by global warming, future generations¶ as victims of nuclear
war or extreme climate change) **[harmed by our acts and
omissions]{.underline}**. Here I mean moral- ity at large, regardless of
its being based on a conception of the right or the good. In other
words, the two **[global challenges, which have received so little
attention in the mainstream philosophy of the last decades, have indeed
philosophical implications capable of undermining the]{.underline}**
business-as-**[usual attitude in moral and political
theory]{.underline}**; I mean the attitude to think of the foundations
of moral- ity and polity as if the man-made (modern) world in which they
operate had not been substantially altered by humankind's newly achieved
capability to destroy itself and/or the planet.¶ Let us make a further
step on the road that leads to uncouple, as far as it goes, the
foundation of a new right of paramount importance from a substantive
conception of the human -- an effort aimed at protecting it from the
uncertain or frail fate of such conceptions. On the one hand, as a
meta-right to individual-only human rights, the right to survival does
not imply a choice among substantive values; this right does not refer
to a partic- ular conception of what is good for future generations, as
it only wants to ensure for them existential condi- tions that are an
indispensable basis for their members to pursue whatever idea of the
good, of liberty and self- realization they may choose. On the other
hand, survival is indeed referred not to the mere biological fact, but
to the survival of humankind in decent, civilized condi- tions, taking
civilization in the meaning explained in §1. Alone, as I explained
above, this qualification is not an added axiological component
(civilization as a sys- tem of values), as it rather relies on the
analytical view that some technical and cultural features of
civilization are essential to the life of the human species.¶ There is a
last aspect to be examined with regard to the structure or nature of
this right: its emergence not from a shift in the doctrine of human
rights, but as a response to a new situation in world history, in which
survival goods (a livable atmosphere in the first place) that were so
far tacitly taken for granted turn out to be no longer guaranteed, but
more and more endangered. As such, this new right reconnects to what we
know about individual human rights, that is that they come up as a
response to "perceived threats" and build an "evolving whole".20¶ b. Let
us now come to the question of the right's bearer. It is humankind,
defined as the generality of the living individuals along with those who
will be born. There are three possible objections to this proposition.¶
First, it seems to be self-evident that the notion of a human right for
the so defined humankind cannot be subject to the classical liberal
objection that bearers of such rights are individuals, not groups.21
Humankind is not an exclusive and self-contained group opposed to others
(at least until we do not have our first contact with¶ dwellers of other
regions of the universe), nor is it meant here to represent particular
sets of values. Between the two meanings of "humanity" --- as species
(Artbegriff) and as regulative notion of a community cemented by shared
values and goals (Zielbegriff)22 --- I am referring to the first one; it
is now becoming philosophically sig- nificant because not even its
biological existence can be taken for granted under man-made threats.
Humankind is not a hypostasis detached from the individuals, as in the
case of 'the community' or 'das Volk,' as it rather means the totality
of the living individuals of any given generation including (a) their
potential to generate fur- ther human beings and generations and (b)
their knowl- edge that the latter will exist and probably suffer. This
reflexive notion of humankind raises a problem, but remains open to
different ethical choices: indifference towards future generations,
responsibility for them, and obligations assumed in their favor.¶ 4. A
second question is: why should we speak of humankind instead of limiting
ourselves to the more sober expression "all present and future
individuals?" There is first a lexicological advantage, in as much as we
thus use one word instead of connecting two by an "and." This better
conveys the sense that the bond of solidarity based on the
responsibility for the elementary living conditions of posterity makes
present and future individuals one community -- in this sole, thin sense
in- deed, which does not try to conceal the deep fractures existing
between contemporaries within the present and the successive generations
of this community. The very inclusion of future people into humankind is
not an act of inclusive kindness towards them, but is rather made
compelling by the lethal threats that past and present people have
projected into the life of posterity, in an amount unprecedented in
history. Lastly, introducing humankind as a bearer of rights highlights
that the right of the individuals to be alive and free can be enjoyed
only in the middle of a larger community, which makes the claim of human
rights possible and helps to im- plement them. In times of economic
globalization and global threats, we have come to know that this com-
munity is the whole humankind, not just nations. All this however does
not alter the truth that who is entitled to vindicate the right to
survival is not humanity as a hypostasis, but every individual either
living or not yet born -- very much like what happens with individual
human rights, whose constitutional formulation makes them enjoyable for
every citizen who will in the future be born under the same
Constitution.¶ Third comes the standard objection: it does not make
sense to endorse obligation towards future people, since, if men and
women agree to stop reproduction, those people might never be born. I
have already dismissed this as a futile mental experiment. It could
further be argued, though, that future generations might turn out¶ to
have moral standards totally different from ours. Yet, the possibility
that posterity will be not amenable to our moral world is not huge
enough to release us from any responsibility towards them. We can still
under- stand, and to an extent share, the moral problems raised by the
Bible or the Greek classical tragedy of millen- nia ago and should not
easily assume that our fellow humans of the year 3000, dwellers of a
planet spoiled by global warming, will be morally so hugely different
from us.¶ Finally, let me anticipate here one of the legal con-
siderations that will be developed later on. Any right- establishing
text (but I am now referring to the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, UDHR 1948) works with the basic formula "everyone has the right
to etc."23 The validity of the claims is limited only by the spatial ex-
tension of the law: a right established by the French Constitution may
be thought to be valid universally, but is legally protected only on
French territory, while the rights mentioned in the UDHR apply by
definition to the entire world where humans live. This can be dubbed
spa- tial universalism, while establishing a right of present and future
humanity to survive is tantamount to adding a time universalism. In
other words, this makes explicit that the right of everyone to a just
international order (UDHR 1948, Art. 28; more below) also holds for the
'everyones' of the year 3000. This may have always been tacitly intended
by the law, the only time limit ly- ing in the possibility that the law
is at some point in the future dismissed by another law canceling or
expand- ing those rights. In a present like ours, in which it has become
known that the future is no longer guaranteed to be essentially
homogeneous (with no radical change in the physical and anthropological
life conditions) to the present and the past, it has become necessary to
openly establish a linkage between our obligations and the rights of
future generations, as far as existential issues are concerned; a link
that will likewise apply to them as soon as they become the present
generation.¶ So far, I have clarified the moral and, to a lesser extent,
legal reasons for introducing the notion of hu- mankind as right bearer.
I will now stress that the hu- mankind discourse in this article remains
political rather than moral.¶ It is not necessary here to rerun the
history of the humankind/humanity notion; it is enough to remember that
its denial has been a stronghold in the battle of value nihilists
(Nietzsche) and realist thinkers (Oswald Spen- gler, who dismissed it as
a "zoological notion," and more extensively Carl Schmitt in Schmitt
1976, particularly §6). As self-contained units (such as the Westphalian
system states) were deemed to be the only sustainable and legitimate
polities, any reference to humanity was seen as toothless or
manipulative, as a noble universalis- tic alibi for particularistic
interests.24 Setting aside this¶ sort of criticism, which mistakes the
ideological use of the term for its very substance, we know that
humanity, as a good-will aspiration of philosophers, poets and re-
ligious men, could not be regarded as a political notion because only
non-voluntaristic communities can be re- garded as political. They alone
allow for binding and effective decisions, whereas any partner can at
any time and according to its convenience withdraw from mem- bership in
"humanity" or other large associations based on just good will.¶ This
can now be expected to change, because **[[planetary]{.mark} lethal
[threats]{.mark} such as nuclear war or disastrous climate change [have
the potential strength to forge all relevant political actors into one
community]{.mark}]{.underline}**, not unlike Hobbes' individuals, **[who
received the push to unite from the threats to their life and
limbs]{.underline}**: first **[because they are all put in danger,
and]{.underline}** second **[because they have to act
jointly]{.underline}** if they really want to fight back those dangers.
**[This is a possibility, not an]{.underline}** actual and **[inevitable
process]{.underline}**, as there are enough counter-forces that impede
those 'Hobbesian' threats to fully make hu- mankind one political
community: fear, the protecting passion, does no longer work as smoothly
as in Hobbes' model of Leviathan.25 Nor is the potential contained in
global challenges supposed to generate a world state as its only
outcome: practicing survival policies, who- ever the actors may be, is
more important than a uni- fied state-like structure in charge of doing
so. Nonethe- less **[all this is enough to use 'humankind' in a
political sense]{.underline}**, as something that is a potential
constituency rather than a fragmented multiplicity of individuals and
states.¶ 5. Why a fundamental rather than a human right? The distinction
between human and fundamental is not univocally worked out in the
literature.26 In the vocab- ulary I am using here, human rights are seen
as a philo- sophical concept and a moral (deontological) precept, while
fundamental rights are those positively acknowl- edged in a legal order,
entrusted to political and institu- tional processes for their
implementation, and claimable in courts -- this last feature being more
problematic. Putting on humankind's survival the label of a funda-
mental right avoids leaving it in a philosophical limbo as a regulative
idea,27 and gives it a better defined political and legal nature; this
is more adequate to the character- istic of survival as something
endangered by political decisions (or the lack thereof) and requesting a
political solution by a given deadline (the next few years if we want to
try to keep the temperature increase expected by 2100 under two
degrees).¶ If humankind's survival is acknowledged as a funda- mental
right, it follows that it should be constitutional- ized, that is
inserted in new and old (and aptly modified) Constitutions as well as in
a new version of the Univer- sal Declaration of Human Rights; as such,
it could be referred to as highest guidance in international treaties
aimed at implementing it -- rather than being enshrined in a specific
'survival' treaty. In constitutional law, a development in this sense is
already taking place, in as much as either the rights of future
generations to a safe environment or our responsibility towards them in
this regard or the imperative to preserve the environ- ment (without
mention of the future generations, but implicitly to their benefit) have
been affirmed in consti- tutional amendments of the last two decades in
countries such as Germany, France, Switzerland, but also Burkina Faso
and Burundi. Having rights or being protected by the legally defined
responsibility of the previous gener- ations is however not the same
thing, and with regard to humankind's survival I would point at its
stronger formulation as a right: it is more binding, while the ob-
jections against endowing future generations with rights can be easily
argued against. Just because it is conceived in favor of those who
cannot yet uphold their interest, this right should be protected against
cancellation by a sort of Ewigkeitsklausel as in Art. 79.3 of the German
Grundgesetz.28 A right to survival is more specific and more stringent
than the right to a safe environment be- cause it derives from lethal
and global challenges that affect the very core of the polity,
protection, rather than from a generic care for a balanced relationship
to na- ture or from a diffuse feeling of benevolence for the posterity.¶
In national or regional Constitutions, the acknowl- edgment of this
right could be accompanied by the establishment of corresponding
institutions, promoting the implementation of the new right; it could be
for example an ombudsman29 for future generation as a
(countermajoritarian)30 authority protecting their inter- ests against
damages resulting from new legislation, and endowed with the power to
send it back to the legislative rather than to veto it straight away.31
Not to be underes- timated are the difficulties that would arise in
striking a very delicate balance on two levels: in general between the
interests of present and future generations,32 but also between
parliaments or executives, which act under the pressure of their
constituencies, and the members of the ombudsman authority, who remain
nonetheless contem- poraries of the former rather than being appointed
by the latter -- for all too natural reasons.¶ The same difficulty would
affect the national courts in which the new fundamental right, as jus
cogens principle, should be made claimable at the initiative of
institutions such as the ombudsman or of advocacy groups representing a
significative number of citizens in a referendum-like counting
procedure. In international courts,33 the interest of future generations
should be represented by an ombudsman to be established at the UN as
well as at regional associations of states such as the EU or Mercosur. A
point however that remains¶ open to further discussion has been raised
in the de- bate on socio-economic or solidarity rights, which may have
some affinity with the right to survival: theoreti- cally, Frank
Michelman has made clear that the status of a norm as constitutional law
ought not to be con- flated with the question of its availability for
judicial enforcement.34 In practice, conflicts are easily possi- ble
between the courts sentencing on the states' failure to implement those
rights and "the vain or overbearing nature of these sentences" on a
matter that is political rather than judicial. 35 This is true in our
case as well: the attainment of a new international order without
national possession of nuclear arms or a carbon-free reordering of the
world economy are goals for policy-making, not something that can be
attained in courts. In this frame- work, however, courts are not
jobless: sentencing the nuclear-armed states for their failure in
implementing art.VI of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT),36 or
the US of the Bush years for withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol and
failing to cut emissions is a typical judicial matter, as the two cases
would regard the break of treaty obligations or the failure to cease
doing some- thing harmful, not to bring about something good.37¶
Finally, two more fundamental objections could be raised against the
idea of a legal protection of the inter- est of future generations. It
could be argued that what would be represented (in a time-universalistic
mode) is not the interest of future generations, but rather the interest
of a particular fraction of the present ones, dis- guising itself as
standard bearer of those people to come. On the one hand this should be
taken into account as critical point of view in the public debate on
those inter- ests. On the other hand, this criticism, strictly speaking,
would also delegitimize such an ancient principle of Roman and Western
law as the protection of the child. In morality it would affirm a
radical skepticism that denies the possibility of slipping into another
person's clothes and acting from a non-egoistic stance. This can be
obviously upheld, but at the price of the disappear- ance of morality as
well as of the polity, which is -- in any case and among other things --
a solidaristic association.¶ A second problem, which is more difficult
to deal with, is that we do not know as a general piece of knowl- edge
what the interest of future generations is; whereas in the case of legal
protection of the child we share a generally accepted knowledge of his
or her future in- terest (to remain healthy, to get sufficient
education, to be free to make the best of him/herself). What the real
life conditions and the presumable vital interests of fu- ture
generations will be can only be tentatively argued from what the several
branches of natural and economic (e.g. demography) science are able to
tell us about what is likely to remain constant in physical and cultural
anthropology and what is likely to be most endangered.¶ As such, it is
important that moral and political theory renew their relationship to
the natural sciences after a time of reciprocal disdain between the two.
While sci- ence cannot by itself draw an encompassing picture of future
life under global threats, philosophy should learn from science what
those future problems are likely to be and elaborate on them, instead of
reflecting on the future of humanity by just moving from the doctrines
of past philosophers or relying on the hearsay about it based on media
reports or the philosopher's personal divinations.¶ 6. My philosophical
proposal to fill a hole in human rights discourse and legislation by
introducing a first or meta-fundamental right of humankind to survival
and positivizing it in national, international and world law38 resonates
with two legal developments. The first related to 'humanity', the second
to 'human rights.' The latter resonates with the novelties in
constitutional law men- tioned in §5.¶ The first one began in 1970 as
the UN General As- sembly adopted Resolution 2749, the Declaration of
Principles Governing the Seabed and Ocean Floor, con- taining the notion
of a "common heritage of mankind"; it was originally introduced to
protect the seabed and ocean floor and later the "moon and other
celestial bod- ies" from exploitation by powerful countries against the
interest of the developing ones.39 In the 1990s, the competing and
"thinner" concept of "common concern of mankind" emerged, as in the
Convention on Bio- diversity of 1992; nonetheless it can be said that
hu- mankind has become a notion contained in binding in- ternational law
and referred to indivisible (climate) and divisible (seabed, ocean
floor, moon) objects, and that this has happened as an answer to
problems and chances generated by huge technological advancement.¶ In
another corner of legal development, it could be argued that the logical
structure, so to speak the norma- tive algorithm of the UDHR norms ---
the aforemen- tioned 'everyone has the right . . . ' --- implies that
hu- mankind, not just single individuals, is to be the bearer of those
rights, even if the collective singular is not used. Turning to a more
substantive level, we could go as far as to say that the legal
protection of humankind's survival was implicitly enshrined as early as
1948 in the UDHR and later in the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights (ICCPR) as well as the In- ternational Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), both of 1966. Art. 28
UDHR ("ev- eryone has the right to a social and international order in
which the rights and freedoms set forth in this Decla- ration can be
fully realized") could be rethought in the direction of institutions
bound to implement for every- one, now and in the future, the right to
life (Art.3 UDHR, Art. 6 ICCPR), the right to an adequate standard of
liv- ing incl. adequate food (Art.11 ICESRC)40 as well as¶ the right of
the family to be protected (Art.10 ICESRC), a right that would be denied
to families of the posterity bound to live under insufferable
environmental condi- tions (cf. above the notion of a transgenerational
chain of parents). While the different binding strength of the several
**[legal formulations]{.underline}** (treaty, covenant, convention,
declaration) **[cannot be ignored]{.underline}**, it remains clear that
le- gal documents do not advance by themselves the cause of humankind's
survival, except if they can be effec- tively referred to in a court of
justice; but **[they create an appropriate and stable environment for
what can really bring about a change, that is educational and political
struggles,]{.underline}** the former aiming at a change in the political
culture.¶ To sum up, (**[hu)mankind has thus ceased to be just a concept
used by philosophers]{.underline}** and theologians, whose presence in
international law was merely philo- sophical, if not rhetorical, as in
the Preamble to the UN Charter of 1945. Though not explicitly endowed
with rights in the documents quoted above, the humankind of the "common
heritage" doctrine is an important prece- dent in the direction,
suggested by this article, of in- troducing this new legal actor. When
looking at the implementation of the rights that can be attributed to
it, the other legal novelty of the "common but dif- ferentiated
responsibility"41 of individual actors, such as countries, should also
be brought to bear. This is important when it comes to distributing the
burden of the duties corresponding to those rights -- which is in- deed
one of the major issues in the debate following the Copenhagen Accord on
Climate Change of 2009. In any case, the legal acknowledgment of a
"common responsibility" for the global commons is a further step in
designing humankind as a juridical notion.¶ This article is
policy-oriented in the peculiar sense of a constitutional policy that
will require decades, if ever, to become the subject of debate and even
longer to be legally implemented. Impulses in this direction are cer-
tainly not be expected from the world of politics, but rather from the
scientific community (provided a now utopian sounding collaboration of
physics, philosophy and legal theory materializes) or from scattered
sen- tences of national and international courts, particularly in
environmental matter.42 **[Support from civil society would
help]{.underline}**.¶ Finally, the author's suggestion as to how to read
this proposal: it has a clearly cosmopolitan (or better: cosmopolitical)
character, not however in the sense of cosmopolitanism as a general
doctrine of government/ governance. It is rather generated by tools
coming from realist thought: new threats as source of new rights, and
lethal and planetary threats to the survival of hu- mankind's
civilization as drivers towards a new level of legal protection.

### AT: Probability First\-\--Consequentialism

#### Ethical policymaking [requires]{.underline} analysis of consequences.

**Fettweis 13** -- Professor of IR @ Tulane

(Chris, "The Pathologies of P acv ower," p. 242-243)

Classical realists have long considered prudence, in Hans Morgenthau\'s
words, \"**[[the supreme virtue in politics]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\"47
Their conception of the term, and how it has traditionally been used in
U.S. foreign policy, is similar to the dictionary definition: wisdom,
caution, circumspection, and \"provident care in the management of
resources.\"48 Simply put, a prudent foreign policy **[would
aim]{.underline}** above all **[[to minimize cost and maximize
benefits]{.underline}]{.mark}**.49 **[It would strive to be rational,
careful, and restrained]{.underline}**, and **[it]{.underline}** would
not waste national resources pursuing low-priority goals or addressing
minor threats.∂ Prudence **[is essentially the ability to weigh
potential consequences of alternative political actions. [It
demands]{.mark} that the main criteria for∂ any decision be a
cost-benefit analysis, or an honest attempt [to
assess]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
**[[implications]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the national interest.
Although **[such calculations]{.underline}** are by necessity uncertain
in a world where rationality is bounded and values unquantifiable, if
policy makers were to value prudence above all other virtues they
**[would]{.underline}** by **[force]{.underline}** of habit explain and
justify their decisions using **[a rational framework, with reference to
reason and evidence]{.underline}** rather than emotion. Were prudence
the defining virtue **[in policy debates]{.underline}**, the ideal for
which policy makers strive, **[it would]{.underline}** quickly
**[silence]{.underline}** the voices of **[fear, honor, glory, and
hubris. The process of evaluation can never be foolproof, but by
insisting that it be at the center of decision making]{.underline}** at
the very least **[prudence can]{.underline}** make assumptions clear and
**[offer a basis for evaluation absent in those decisions driven by
pathology]{.underline}**.∂ **[[The evaluation of policy cannot be done
without recognition of cost. Simply achieving a
goal]{.underline}]{.mark}** - or winning - **[[does not justify
action]{.underline}]{.mark}**. To be considered rational, the **[[other
side of the ledger must be considered]{.mark} as well]{.underline}**.
**[This may sound obvious, but a surprising number of scholars and
analysts judge foreign policies based solely on]{.underline}** whether
or not **[objectives]{.underline}** are fulfilled.50
**[[Neocons]{.mark}ervatives in particular tend to [ignore
costs]{.mark}]{.underline}**, assuming that the United States is capable
of paying virtually any price in the fight against evil. **[[The war in
Iraq]{.mark}, that exemplar of imprudence, [was not preceded by]{.mark}
extensive [projections]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the likely price tag.
When pressed, **[Bush]{.underline}** administration officials repeatedly
**[deferred such discussions]{.underline}** by denying such estimates
were possible.5\' At best, they were of secondary relevance. In the
war\'s aftermath, the same officials stress how much better the world is
without Saddam rather than how much worse it is without those who gave
their lives in removing him.∂ Like realism itself, **[prudence is hardly
amoral. [It]{.mark} merely [demands]{.mark} a focus on the [morality of
outcomes,]{.mark} not intentions]{.underline}**. **[Actions that produce
bad results are imprudent, [no matter how good the
intent]{.mark}]{.underline}**. On this, Morgenthau quotes Lincoln:∂ I do
the very best I know, the very best I can, and I mean to keep doing so
until the end. If the end brings me out all right, what is said against
me won\'t amount to anything. If the end brings me out wrong, ten angels
swearing I was right would make no difference.2∂ Although the central
criteria for prudent cost-benefit analyses must be the national
interest, no abnegation of national ideals or international
responsibility need follow. Foreign humanitarian assistance is cheap,
relatively speaking, and often carries benefits for donor and recipient
alike. The entire operation in Somalia, during which as many as a
quarter million lives were saved, cost U.S. taxpayers less than two
billion dollars.53 More was spent every week at the height of the Iraq
war. Qaddafi was removed for half that.∂ **[A focus on the outcome makes
it clear that the Iraq war was a blunder of the first order. Even
if]{.underline}** the **[intentions]{.underline}** of the Bush
administration **[were]{.underline}** indeed **[good, it is hard to see
how the outcome can be said to be worth the cost]{.underline}**. Thomas
Ricks quotes a senior intelligence official in Iraq as saying that the
long-term American goal after the surge is \"a stable Iraq that is
unified, at peace with its neighbors, and is able to police its
inter-nal affairs, so it isn\'t a sanctuary for Al Qaeda. Preferably a
friend to us, but it doesn\'t have to be.\"54 Presumably one could add
the absence of weapons of mass destruction to this rather scaled-back
list of goals, and perhaps the continuation of the uninterrupted flow of
oil from the Gulf. In other words, if all goes well over the course of
the next few years -and there is obviously no guarantee it will - Iraq
might look quite a bit like it did in 2003, only with a marginally more
friendly dictator in charge. **[The cost]{.underline}** of this
restoration of the virtual status quo ante **[will be at least
forty-five hundred American dead and some thirty thousand wounded, at
least a hundred thousand Iraqis killed and millions more
displaced]{.underline}**, and up to as many as three trillion U.S.
taxpayer dollars spent.55 The war inspired many young Arabs, such as
Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, to join the∂ ranks ofjihadi terrorists,
swelling the ranks of America\'s true enemies. Al-Asiri is currently the
main bomb maker for \"Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula,\" the group
that operates out of Yemen and continues to try to take down Western
airliners, and he is considered the \"most dangerous man in the world\"
according to many people who maintain such rankings.56 **[The decision
to invade Iraq may well turn out to be the most imprudent action this
country has ever taken]{.underline}**.∂ Another operation from the same
year might serve as a counterexample to Iraq, a prudent foreign policy
adventure where the benefits outweighed the costs. The July 2003
intervention in Liberia may be little remembered, but that is partially
because it was such a success. The United States deployed around two
thousand Marines to Monrovia and ended a siege during a particularly
brutal civil war. Security returned to the capital and an unknowable
number of lives were saved. Unlike in Somalia, die mission did not creep
into nation building, proving that intervention need not be tainted by
hubris. By October the civil war had effectively ended and the Marines
withdrew, having suffered no casualties and incurring little cost to the
U.S. taxpayer. In the years since, Charles Taylor, the paragon of the
West African kleptocradc despot, was put on trial at The Hague and the
security situation in Liberia has improved markedly. The Marines have
not returned.∂ **[No assessment of costs and benefits can guarantee good
decisions, of course. But by making assumptions clear, by]{.underline}**
inculcating and **[[rewarding a systematic evaluation of
alternatives]{.mark}, expectations can be assessed more rationally and
[decisions rescued from emotion]{.mark}. If leaders work actively to
minimize pathologies and replace them with rational, fact-based beliefs,
the odds of arriving at rational conclusions rise]{.underline}**. If
prudence is the goal, therefore, the following should form the core of
the foreign policy conventional wisdom:∂ • The world is more peaceful
than ever before.∂ • While no country is ever completely safe, the
United States has few - if any - serious security threats.

**[As we address [very complex systems]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[such
as human civilisation and global ecosystems, a concept as important as
infinite impact in this report is that of infinity impact
threshold]{.underline}**. This is **[[the impact level]{.mark} that
[can]{.mark} [trigger a chain of events]{.mark} [that results in
the]{.mark} [end of]{.mark} human [civilisation]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[The]{.underline}** infinite impact threshold (**[IIT]{.underline}**)
**[concept represents the idea that long before an actual infinite
impact is reached [there is a]{.mark} [tipping point]{.mark} [where
it]{.mark}]{.underline}** (with some probability) **[is [no longer
possible to reverse]{.mark} events.]{.underline}** So instead of
focusing only on the ultimate impact **[it is important to estimate what
level of impact the infinity threshold entails. The IIT is defined as an
impact that can trigger a chain of events that could
result]{.underline}** first in a civilisation collapse, and then later
result **[in an infinite impact. Such [thresholds are]{.mark}
[especially important to recognise in]{.mark} a [complex]{.mark} and
interconnected [society where resilience is
decreasing]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Social and ecological systems are
complex, and in most complex systems there are thresholds where positive
feedback loops become self-reinforcing.]{.underline}** In a system where
resilience is too low, feedback loops can result in a total system
collapse. **[These thresholds are very difficult to estimate and in most
cases it is possible only to estimate their order of
magnitude.]{.underline}** As David Orrell and Patrick McSharry wrote in
A Systems Approach to Forecasting: "Complex systems have emergent
properties, qualities that cannot be predicted in advance from knowledge
of systems components alone". According to complexity scientist Stephen
Wolfram's principle of computational irreducibility, the only way to
predict the evolution of such a system is to run the system itself:
"There is no simple set of equations that can look into its future." 55
Orrell and McSharry also noted that "in orthodox economics, the
reductionist approach means that the economy is seen as consisting of
individual, independent agents who act to maximise their own utility. It
assumes that prices are driven to a state of near-equilibrium by the
'invisible hand' of the economy. Deviations from this state are assumed
to be random and independent, so the price fluctuations are often
modelled using the normal distribution or other distributions with thin
tails and finite variance." **[The drawbacks of an approach using the
normal distribution, or other distributions with thin tails and finite
variance, become obvious when the unexpected happens]{.underline}** as
in the recent credit crunch, when existing models totally failed to
capture the true risks of the economy. As an employee of Lehman Brothers
put it on August 11, 2007: "Events that models predicted would happen
only once in 10,000 years happened every day for three days." 56 **[The
exact level for an infinite impact threshold should not be the focus,
but rather the fact that [such thresholds exists and that]{.mark} an
order of [magnitude should be estimated]{.mark}.]{.underline}**57 During
the process of writing the report, experts suggested that **[a
relatively quick death of two billion people could be used as a
tentative number until more research is available]{.underline}**.58 With
current trends undermining ecological and social resilience it should be
noted that the threshold level is likely to become lower as time
progress.
