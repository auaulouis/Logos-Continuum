# Topicality 

### T\--USFG

#### A) Neg Interp:

#### 1. The federal government is the central government in Washington D.C.

Elizabeth **Jewell, 2007**. (Editor), OXFORD AMERICAN DICTIONARY, 2007,

[[Federal:]{.underline}]{.mark} Of. relating to. or [[denoting the
central government as distinguished from the separate units constituting
a federation]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### 2. Should is an obligation to act.

(4ed); pg. 1612, Accessed via google books

Usage Note Like the rules governing the use of shall and will on which
they are based, the traditional rules governing the use of should and
would are largely ignored in modern American practice. Either should or
would can now be used in the first person to express conditional
futurity: If I had known that, I would (or somewhat more formally,
should) have answered differently. But in the second and third persons
only would is used: If he had known that, he would (not should) have
answered differently. Would cannot always be substituted for should,
however. Should is used in all three persons in a conditional clause if
I (or you or he) should decide to go. [[Should is]{.underline}]{.mark}
also [[used]{.underline}]{.mark} in all three persons [[to express duty
or obligation (the equivalent of ought to)]{.underline}]{.mark}: I (or
you or he) should go. On the other hand, would is used to express
volition or promise: / agreed that I would do it. Either would or should
is possible as an auxiliary with like, be inclined, be glad, prefer, and
related verbs: I would (or should) like to call your attention to an
oversight. Here would was acceptable on all levels to a large majority
of the Usage Panel in an earlier survey and is more common in American
usage than should. Should have is sometimes incorrectly written should
of by writers who have mistaken the source of the spoken contraction
should \'ve. See Usage Notes at if, rather, shall.

#### 3. Resolved means fixed in purpose or intention.

#### B) Violation---The AFF does not defend topical action by the USFG

#### C) Reasons to prefer:

#### 1) There must be meaningful agreement to basic terms in order for debate to take place---this is critical to create protest and resistance movements.

Ruth Lessl **Shively, 2000** (Assistant Prof Political Science -- Texas
A&M), POLITICAL THEORY AND PARTISAN POLITICS, 2000, 181-182.

The requirements given thus far are primarily negative. [[The ambiguists
must say "no]{.underline}]{.mark}" to---[[they must reject and
limit---some ideas and actions.]{.mark}]{.underline} In what follows,
[[we will also find that they must say "yes" to some
things]{.underline}]{.mark}. In particular, they must say "yes" to the
idea of rational persuasion. This means, first that they must recognize
the role of agreement in political contest, or the basic accord that is
necessary to discord. [[The mistake the abmiguists
make]{.underline}]{.mark} here is a common one. The mistake [[is in
thinking that agreement marks the end of contest---that consensus kills
debate]{.underline}]{.mark}. But this is true only if the agreement is
perfect---if there is nothing at all left to question or contest. [[In
most cases, however]{.underline}]{.mark}, our agreements are highly
imperfect. [[We agree on some matters but not on others, on generalities
but not on specifics,]{.underline}]{.mark} on principles but not on
their applications, and so on. [[And this kind of limited agreement is
the starting condition of contest and debate.]{.mark}]{.underline} As
John Courtney Murray writes: We hold certain truths; therefore we can
argue about them. It seems to have been one of the corruptions of
intelligence by positivism to assume that argument ends when agreement
is reached. In a basic sense, the reverse is true. [[There can be no
argument]{.underline}]{.mark} except on the premise, and [[within a
context, of agreement]{.underline}]{.mark}. (Murray 1960, 10) In other
words, we cannot argue about something if we are not communicating: [[if
we cannot agree on the topic and terms of argument]{.underline}]{.mark}
or if we have utterly different ideas about what counts as evidence or
good argument. [[At the very least, we must agree about what it is that
is being debated before we can debate it.]{.mark}]{.underline} For
instance, one cannot have an argument about euthanasia with someone who
thinks euthanasia is a musical group. [[One cannot successfully stage a
sit-in if one's target audience simply thinks everyone is
resting]{.underline}]{.mark} or if those doing the sitting have no
complaints. [[Nor can one demonstrate resistance to a policy if no one
knows that it is a policy]{.underline}]{.mark}. In other words, contest
is meaningless if there is a lack of agreement or communication about
what is being contested. [[Resisters, demonstrators, and debaters must
have some shared ideas about the subject and/or the terms of their
disagreements]{.underline}]{.mark}. The participants and the target of a
sit-in must share an understanding of the complaint at hand. And a
demonstrator's audience must know what is being resisted. In short,
[[the contesting of an idea presumes some agreement about what that idea
is and how one might go about intelligibly contesting
it]{.underline}]{.mark}. In other words, contestation rests on some
basic agreement or harmony.

#### 2) Calls for feminist equality must be attached to particular policies to be effective---their lack of a plan will lead to burnout:

Barbara **Epstein, 2001** (Professor of History of Consciousness at UC
Santa Cruz) MONTHLY REVIEW, 2001. Accessed online from
monthlyreview.org.

The anarchist sensibility has made important contributions to the
radical tradition in U.S. history. It has brought an insistence on
equality and democracy, a resistance to compromise of principle for the
sake of political expediency. Anarchism has been associated with efforts
to put the values of the movement into practice and to create
communities governed by these values. Anarchism has also been associated
with political theater and art, with creativity as an element of
political practice. It has insisted that radical politics need not be
dreary. But [[the anarchist mindset]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} its doctrinaire side, [[a tendency to insist
on principle to the point of disregarding]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[context or]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[results of political
action]{.underline}]{.mark}. In this regard the anarchist sensibility
has something in common with the outlook of Christian radicals who
believe in acting on their consciences and leaving the consequences to
God. [[The moral absolutism of the anarchist approach to politics is
difficult to sustain in the context of a social
movement]{.underline}]{.mark}. Absolute internal equality is hard to
sustain. Movements need leaders. Anti-leadership ideology cannot
eliminate leaders, but it can lead a movement to deny that it has
leaders, thus undermining democratic constraints on those who assume the
roles of leadership, and also preventing the formation of vehicles for
recruiting new leaders when the existing ones become too tired to
continue. [[Within radical feminism a view of all hierarchies as
oppressive led to attacks on those who took on the responsibilities of
leadership. This led to]{.underline}]{.mark} considerable internal
conflict, and created a [[reluctance to take on leadership roles, which
weakened the movement. Movements dominated by an anarchist mindset are
prone to burning out early]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### 3) Successful grassroots activism against the arms lobby is possible if citizen activists remain informed and have particular goals---savvy leadership that understands the issue is vital.

Lessons Learned Here are some lessons that we have drawn from observing
and/or participating in the above campaigns. First, [[the most critical
element is savvy, determined and communicative leadership-both at the
national level and at the local level. Without it, the message won\'t be
developed, the strategy will be missing, the coalition won\'t be formed
or expanded]{.underline}]{.mark} and the work won\'t get done.
[[Leadership]{.mark}]{.underline} may be vested in an individual or a
group. Either way, it [[must identify a clear objective, develop a
workable plan of action for achieving that objective and communicate
that plan to allies and partners]{.mark}]{.underline} in a timely
manner. It must then report back to these networks on the outcomes of
actions taken, and prepare them for the next step. Second,
[[coalition-building is essential]{.underline}]{.mark}. Especially
important are particularly influential or unusual allies-such as
veterans\' groups, business associations or organized labor-not
typically involved with arms control issues. [[It takes a lot
of]{.underline}]{.mark} initial outreach and [[education to convince
an]{.underline}]{.mark} organization or [[individual to become active in
working against arms trafficking]{.underline}]{.mark}. Prepare outreach
materials with care, and with an eye toward what will be most persuasive
to the groups or people you are trying to bring into your coalition. But
to grow a coalition you must have a structure for new members to plug
into-someone or some place to pass their name and telephone number to.
Make sure that new coalition members are added into the information
loop. Dont waste time recruiting them, only to let them wander off from
lack of use. Third is the realization that \"[[the arms trade\" as an
issue is too big and too diffuse. The most successful campaigns outlined
above have narrower and more discrete focuses-for
example]{.underline}]{.mark}, banning the export of a particular type of
weapon, or [[blocking the export of a particular weapon to a particular
place. These]{.underline}]{.mark} [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} ambitious
but [[achievable goals. When you try to shut down the entire arms trade,
on the other hand, you set yourself up against all arms manufacturers,
all foreign lobbyists]{.underline}]{.mark}, all of the bureaucracy, etc.
[[With a narrow, focused goal, you might be able to identify allies
within the bureaucracy who can be invaluable in advancing a particular
reform]{.underline}]{.mark}. Fourth, [[stay on message about your goal.
Be clear and consistent in explaining why you oppose the trade of a
particular weapon (or trade to a particular
recipient]{.underline}]{.mark}, as the case may be). Do not shy away
from moral and humanitarian arguments. [[You also must have rebuttals to
all of the military, diplomatic and economic arguments that will
predictably be raised in opposition]{.underline}]{.mark}, but the moral
and humanitarian impulse is the strongest motivating factor on our side
and should not be ignored or downplayed. As part of this effort, use
photos and film to show the effect of weapons on people, and bring the
voices of victims to the public, press and policy makers. Personal
testimony is very powerful. Fifth, [[solid analysis is necessary to make
and back up your case. Link a carefully developed research agenda
closely to policy]{.underline}]{.mark}, press and grassroots strategies.
Sixth, [[find and groom solid Congressional
leadership]{.underline}]{.mark} (both Member of Congress and staff).
Seventh, pursue the issue internationally. A global approach effectively
combats the \"if we don\'t sell, someone else will\" amorality that
permeates arms trading. It also provides a wider pool of experiences,
perspectives and creativity upon which to draw. Strategies Generally
speaking, the twin-and linked-goals of all public interest and activist
efforts are to [[build public awareness and]{.underline}]{.mark} to
[[increase pressure on the government for some desired change of
policy.]{.mark} [Lacking the big money of the arms corporations,
national and international campaigns opposing weapons proliferation rely
on several standard and low-cost grassroots
tactics]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### 4) Predictable ground is different than some ground. Predictable ground comes from the resolution---the fact that there may be arguments against the affirmative does not mean we have adequately researched all those ideas to compete fairly.

#### D) T is a voter

#### 1) Procedural fairness outweighs substantive fairness---the ballot should reward who did the better debating---which is impossible without procedural fairness.

#### 2) Fairness precedes education---you will gain a shallow education if the neg isn't prepared to contest the AFF. 

### T Extensions: Gender Issues Must Be Tied to Policy to Be Effective

#### Consciousness raising alone causes feminists to turn away from political activity---turning the AFF: 

**Smith 94 \[leading member of the US International Socialist
Organization, 1994 Sharon, International Socialism 62 Spring,
<http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=311>\]**

But **[[rather than channelling women into greater political
involvement, consciousness-raising tended to lead women away from
activity]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The typical consciousness-raising group
lasted nine months, and most women left the women's movement after that.
For many of those who stayed, **[[consciousness-raising became an end in
itself. And it led to a turn away from politics]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and an ever greater atmosphere of personalism within the movement. Even
Redstockings, quoted above, dissolved itself within less than two years
of issuing its 'manifesto'. In the words of one feminist involved, 'When
you stop looking out, and turn exclusively inward, at some point you
begin to feed on each other. If you don't direct your anger
externally---politically---you turn it against yourselves.'18¶ The
politics of separatism exacerbated this tendency in organisations of
radical feminists. Although set up as 'non-hierarchical', the picture
was hardly one of mutual support. Instead the atmosphere tended to be
intensely moralistic and extremely judgmental towards lifestyle. One
woman who participated in a women's liberation group said afterwards[,
**['If \[consciousness-raising is\] all you do, then the enemy becomes
the enemy within.]{.underline}**]{.mark} First they attack leaders, then
lifestyle, then racism.' Another described, [[**'In the name of
anti-elitism, they were trying to pull off the most elite thing
possible**.]{.underline}]{.mark} The meeting ended with charges and
counter-charges and a distinct lack of a feeling of sisterhood.'19 Some
women's liberation groups carried the idea of lifestyle politics to an
extreme, by forming living or other collectives based upon strict
women-only guidelines. One extreme such living collective was Boston's
'Cell 16', which demanded that every woman living there practise
celibacy; only one third of the women could be married; and any woman
who had a male child was forced to give him up.20

#### The state is not inherently patriarchal -- reformism is a more effective way to challenge patriarchy

**Rhode 94** (Deborah L. Rhode, Law Prof @ Stanford, April 1994,
"Changing Images of the State," 107 Harv. L. Rev. 1181)

[**Neither can the state be understood solely as an instrument of men\'s
interests**.]{.underline} As a threshold matter, what constitutes those
interests is not self-evident, as MacKinnon\'s own illustrations
suggest. If, for example, policies liberalizing abortion serve male
objectives by enhancing access to female sexuality, policies curtailing
abortion presumably also serve male objectives by reducing female
autonomy. n23 In effect, patriarchal frameworks verge on tautology.
[Almost any gender-related policy can be seen as either directly serving
men\'s immediate interests, or as compromising short-term concerns in
the service of broader, long-term goals, such as \"normalizing\" the
system and stabilizing power relations. [A framework that can
characterize all state interventions as directly or indirectly
patriarchal offers little practical guidance in challenging the
conditions it condemns.]{.mark}]{.underline} And if women are not a
homogenous group with unitary concerns, surely the same is true of men.
Moreover, if [[the state is best understood as a network of institutions
with complex, sometimes competing agendas]{.underline}]{.mark}, then the
patriarchal model of single-minded instrumentalism seems highly
implausible. [It is difficult to dismiss all the anti-discrimination
initiatives of the last quarter century as purely counter-revolutionary
strategies. And it is precisely these initiatives, with their appeal to
\"male\" norms of \"objectivity and the impersonality of procedure, that
\[have created\] \[\*1186\] leverage for the representation of women\'s
interests.\"]{.underline} n24 Cross-cultural research also suggests that
[[the status of women is positively correlated with a strong state,
which is scarcely the relationship that patriarchal frameworks
imply]{.underline}.]{.mark} n25 While the \"tyrannies\" of public and
private dependence are plainly related, many feminists challenge the
claim that they are the same. As Carole Pateman notes, women do not
\"live with the state and are better able to make collective struggle
against institutions than individuals.\" n26 To advance that struggle,
[[feminists need more concrete and contextual accounts of state
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark} than patriarchal frameworks have
supplied. Lumping together police, welfare workers, and Pentagon
officials as agents of a unitary patriarchal structure does more to
obscure than to advance analysis. What seems necessary is a contextual
approach that can account for greater complexities in women\'s
relationships with governing institutions. Yet despite their
limitations, patriarchal theories underscore an insight that generally
informs feminist theorizing. As Part II reflects, governmental
institutions are implicated in the most fundamental structures of
sex-based inequality and in the strategies necessary to address it.
These tensions within the women\'s movement are, of course, by no means
unique. [For any subordinate group, the state is a primary source of
both repression and assistance in the struggle for equality. These
constituencies cannot be \"for\" or \"against\" state involvement in any
categorical sense. **The questions are always what forms of involvement,
to what ends, and who makes these decisions**]{.underline}. From some
feminist perspectives, liberalism has failed to respond adequately to
those questions because of deeper difficulties. In part, the problem
stems from undue faith in formal rights. The priority granted to
individual entitlements undermines the public\'s sense of collective
responsibility. This critique has attracted its own share of criticism
from within as well as from outside the feminist community. As many left
feminists, including critical race theorists, have noted, [rights-based
claims have played a crucial role in advancing group as well as
individual interests. n32 Such claims can express desires not only for
autonomy, but also for participation in the struggles that shape
women\'s collective existence. **The priority that state institutions
place on rights is not in itself problematic.**]{.underline}

#### Critiquing gender relations alone fails---need real world strategies:

**Caprioli 2004** ("Feminist IR Theory and Quantitative Methodology: A
Critical Analysis" Mary Caprioli, Dept. of Political Science, University
of Tennessee. International Studies Review. Volume 42 Issue 1 Page
193-197, March 2004.
http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/doi/10.1111/0020-8833.00076)

[If researchers cannot add gender to an analysis, then they must
necessarily use a purely female-centered analysis, even though the
utility of using a purely female centered analysis seems equally biased.
[Such research would merely be gendercentric based on women rather than
men, and it would thereby provide an equally biased account of
international relations as those that are
male-centric.]{.mark}]{.underline} Although one might speculate that
having research done from the two opposing worldviews might more fully
explain international relations, surely an integrated approach would
offer a more comprehensive analysis of world affairs. [Beyond a
female-centric analysis, some scholars]{.underline} (for example, Carver
2002) [argue that feminist research must offer a critique of gender as a
set of power relations. [Gender categories, however, do exist and have
very real implications for individuals, social relations, and
international affairs. Critiquing the social construction of gender is
important, but it fails to provide new theories of international
relations or to address the implications of gender for what happens in
the world.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### HYPOTHESIZING ABOUT THE COMPLEX INNER WORKING OF GOVERNMENT IS KEY TO CREATING SPACE FOR RADICAL POLITICS

David **McClean 2001** "The cultural left and the limits of Social
Hope," AM Phil Conf,
www.Americanphilosophy.org/archives/passconferenceprograms/pc2001/Discussion%20papers/david_mcclean.htm

We who fancy ourselves philosophers would do well to create from within
ourselves and from within our ranks a new kind of public intellectual
who has both a hungry theoretical mind and who is yet capable of seeing
the need to move past high theory to other important questions that are
less bedazzling and \"interesting\" but more important to the prospect
of our flourishing -- questions such as \"How is it possible to develop
a citizenry that cherishes a certain hexis, one which prizes the
character of the Samaritan on the road to Jericho almost more than any
other?\" or \"How can we square the political dogma that undergirds the
fantasy of a missile defense system with the need to treat America as
but one member in a community of nations under a \"law of peoples?\"
[[The new public philosopher]{.underline}]{.mark} might seek to
understand labor law and military and trade theory and doctrine as much
as theories of surplus value; the logic of international markets and
trade agreements as much as critiques of commodification, and the
politics of complexity as much as the politics of power (all of which
can still be done from our arm chairs.) This [[means going down deep
into the guts of our]{.underline}]{.mark} quotidian [[social
institutions, into the grimy pragmatic details]{.underline}]{.mark}
where intellectuals are loathe to dwell but where the officers and
bureaucrats of those institutions take difficult and often unpleasant,
imperfect decisions that affect other peoples\' lives, and [[it means
making honest attempts to truly understand how those
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark} actually
[[function]{.underline}]{.mark} in the actual world [[before howling for
their overthrow]{.underline}]{.mark} commences. [[This might help keep
us from being slapped down in debates by true policy pros who actually
know what they are talking about]{.underline}]{.mark} but who lack
awareness of the dogmatic assumptions from which they proceed, [[and who
have not yet found a good reason to listen to jargon-riddled lectures
from philosophers and culture critics]{.underline}]{.mark} with their
snobish disrespect for the so-called \"managerial class.\"

### 2nc Extensions---Activism Against Arms Lobby Can Be Successful

#### Ordinary citizens can be "bird-dogs" that hold the arms industry accountable for their actions---an alert and knowledgeable citizenry is crucial to this effort

**AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE**, Apr. 16, 20**15**. Retrieved May

Eisenhower\'s Warning Eisenhower introduced the term into the political
vocabulary in a 1961 speech in which he described the rise of "a
permanent armaments industry of vast proportions." "This conjunction of
an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in
the American experience," declared the former five-star general. "The
total influence -- economic, political, even spiritual -- is felt in
every city, every State house, every office of the Federal government."
The president went on to warn, "In the councils of government, we must
guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought
or unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential for the
disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist." Fifty-four
years later, the "conjunction" between arms and politics is no longer
new, but Eisenhower's warning rings truer than ever. \"Governing Under
the Influence\" That's why the American Friends Service Committee is
calling attention to "Governing Under the Influence," or GUI. [[By
activating volunteers to raise issues with the would-be
presidents]{.mark}]{.underline} roaming around New Hampshire and Iowa,
[[AFSC hopes to drive concerns about excessive corporate influence over
government policy -- for which the
military-industrial-complex]{.underline}]{.mark} continues to be a stark
example -- [[into the heart of the country's political
discourse]{.underline}]{.mark}. Already [[AFSC has trained hundreds of
volunteers to be "bird dogs," citizen activists who will put candidates
on the spot with well-crafted questions that also raise awareness and
get attention from reporters covering the campaign.]{.underline}]{.mark}
The GUI project has another branch at AFSC's office in Des Moines, Iowa,
and a dynamic website that keeps up-to-date calendars of candidate
appearances, publishes reports of encounters with candidates, and
provides ongoing analysis of the GUI syndrome. Military policy analyst
William Hartung, who visited New Hampshire on a 4-day speaking tour
sponsored by AFSC, NH Peace Action, and other groups, used Rep. McKeon's
campaign fundraising as an example of GUI. In the post-Citizens United
era of Super PACs and clandestine gifts to political groups, some of the
techniques military contractors use to reward their political friends
are "almost quaint," Hartung said. But there's a lot more to it than
campaign cash, he explained at talks in Durham, Henniker, Keene,
Concord, Canterbury, and Manchester. 866 Lobbyists for the Military
Weapons Makers First, there are lobbyists, hundreds of them, compared to
a mere handful for organizations like Peace Action that advocate for
lower levels of military spending. The Center for Responsive Politics,
which tracks lobbying as well as campaign spending, says that "defense"
lobbyists spent more than \$126 million last year, an amount that
doesn't include activities for which Washington-based power brokers do
not have to report. According to the Center, 533 out of 866 registered
lobbyists for "defense" companies were "revolvers," i.e. individuals who
have gone through the "revolving door" between government service and
employment as lobbyists. Take Lockheed Martin, the number one military
contractor, as an example. It contracted with 21 firms last year on top
of its own staff lobbyists to work Washington connections. All told
Lockheed has 96 lobbyists, two-thirds of whom have gone through the
revolving door, among them former Senators Alphonse D'Amato, John
Breaux, and Trent Lott, and former Congressmen Bart Stupak and Sonny
Callahan. In 2014, Lockheed spent half a million dollars on the services
of the Podesta Group, headed by Tony Podesta and his brother John, who
is in the news this week as the chairman of Hillary Clinton's officially
launched presidential campaign. Generals Go Through the Revolving Door
It's not just members of Congress and their staff. A Boston Globe
article by Bryan Bender reported, "From 2004 through 2008, 80 percent of
retiring three- and four-star officers went to work as consultants or
defense executives, according to the Globe analysis. That compares with
less than 50 percent who followed that path a decade earlier, from 1994
to 1998." Bender reported that the Pentagon even sponsors seminars to
teach retiring senior officers how to move from military service to a
lucrative career with a military contractor. "In some years, the move
from general staff to industry is a virtual clean sweep. Thirty-four out
of 39 three- and four-star generals and admirals who retired in 2007 are
now working in defense roles --- nearly 90 percent," Bender found. Many
of them also volunteer on Pentagon advisory committees. And the
revolving door doesn't just lead to K Street lobbying firms; it also
opens the way to "think tanks" funded by the weapons makers and media
institutions that cover politics. The impact of the contributions and
the lobbying can be seen in a military budget in the vicinity of a
trillion dollars a year if you add up the regular Defense Department
appropriation, add the special war budget (now known as "Overseas
Contingency Operations"), the Department of Energy's allocation for
nuclear weapons, the "homeland security" budget, the secret budgets of
the CIA and NSA, and the expense of past wars. "There's a huge imbalance
between what we spend on the military and what we spend on diplomacy,"
Hartung said. \$500 Million in Weapons Unaccounted For (and that\'s just
in Yemen) The Pentagon has so much money and so many weapons its 1.5
million employees can't even keep track of it, Hartung explained. That
the agency can't pass an audit is a fact that might even get attention
from fiscal conservatives among the presidential contenders. The fact
that the Pentagon "is unable to account for more than \$500 million in
U.S. military aid given to Yemen," as the Washington Post reported in
March, ought to get the attention of anyone with a shred of common
sense. Hartung also points to overseas weapons sales as another example
of government on the side of the arms industry, which recently succeeded
in moving arms sales licensing from the State Department to the Commerce
Department. (Lockheed Martin's chief executive recently assured
investors they don't have to worry about peace breaking out if the USA
and Iran ink a nuclear weapons agreement. There's enough "volatility" in
the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region to maintain a high demand
for Lockheed's products, she said.) And then there's what Hartung calls
"party favors," little gestures the weapons makers make for their
friends. When Rep. John Murtha headed the Armed Services Committee,
Lockheed, Boeing, Northrup Grumman, and General Dynamics spread their
largess to the Johnstown PA symphony orchestra, where Murtha's wife was
a major supporter. "During the first six months of 2008, lobbyists,
corporations and interest groups gave approximately \$13 million to
charities and nonprofit organizations in honor of more than 200 members
of the House and Senate," the NY Times reported. You can call it the
military industrial complex, you can call it systemic corruption, you
can call it GUI. Whatever you call it, catering to the self-interest of
giant corporations that profit from war is no way to run a government
that is supposed to be "of the people, by the people, and for the
people." Liberty and Democracy Endangered That brings us back to Buck
McKeon, who used to run the Armed Services Committee. When his wife,
Patricia Kunz McKeon, ran for the California Assembly in 2012, she of
course needed to raise money for her campaign. Although her pet issue
was repeal of the state's plastic bag tax, not arming the National Guard
with missiles, military contractors were at her side with \$34,000 in
campaign contributions. Lockheed Martin kicked in \$3000, and while she
didn't win, they no doubt saw the expense as a good investment in their
alliance with her powerful husband. Buck McKeon retired from Congress
last year, but he's apparently not headed for a quiet retirement.
Instead, he has opened a consulting firm in Washington. According to a
press release sent out from The McKeon Group in February, "Mr. McKeon
looks forward to using his background and experience to provide
strategic advice to clients, while continuing to be outspoken for a
strong national defense." The Center for Public Integrity reports he's
already lined up a contract with Aerojet Rocketdyne, "a world-recognized
aerospace and defense leader providing propulsion and energetics to the
space, missile defense, strategic, tactical missile and armaments areas
in support of domestic and international markets." Sounding his
prophetic warning about the perilous alliance between the armaments
industry and the government, President [[Eisenhower]{.underline}]{.mark}
said, "We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our
liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted."
He also [[called for the awakening of "an alert and knowledgeable
citizenry" to keep the government on the side of
peace]{.underline}]{.mark}. That's us. Get in touch with AFSC\'s NH
Program, our Des Moines office, or NH Peace Action to get involved.

Campaigns [[Despite many hurdles, a great deal of progress has been made

why we wrote this book! But [[it is important to
acknowledge]{.mark}]{.underline} and reflect on [[the
victories]{.underline}]{.mark} and achievements. [[Establishing a Code
of Conduct]{.underline}]{.mark} A primary focus of much work by US
activists and more than 100 national organizations since the mid-1990s
has been the establishment of a Code of Conduct for US arms exporting.
Pending Code of Conduct legislation would establish eligibility criteria
for countries to be able to receive arms from America. Under these
criteria, the importing state must: 1) have a democratic form of
government; 2) respect the human rights of its citizens; 3) have a
policy and practice of non-aggression against other states; and 4)
participate in the UN Register of Conventional Arms. The first three of
these requirements are primary foreign policy tenets of past and present
US administrations. Nevertheless, according to analysis by the group
Demilitarization for Democracy, 85 percent of US arms transfers during
1990-95 went to states which do not meet these criteria. Under the Code
of Conduct, the executive branch could still export arms to governments
that fail to meet these conditions, if the President certifies that
doing so is a matter of US national security. Although this measure
would not end all objectionable arms transfers, it would raise the level
of scrutiny on the most risky exports. Moreover, the President\'s annual
certification of states which meet the Code\'s conditions, and his
requests for waivers, would provide a hook for organizing outreach,
media and legislative work. Public interest groups drafted the concept
for this legislation in 1993, began developing a grassroots base of
support for it and conducted extensive media and other educational work
promoting it. They found legislative sponsors in Reps. Cynthia McKinney
(D-GA) and Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), who have formed an unlikely
liberal-conservative leadership team for the legislation in the House.
In the Senate, John Kerry (D-MA) has assumed the mantle of leadership
for the Code after the retirement of Mark Hatfield (R-OR) in 1996. The
campaign made great strides during 1997, when the House of
Representatives accepted the Code of Conduct as an amendment to the
fiscal year 1998-99 State Department authorization bill. (The Senate
version of the State Department bill did not include the Code.)
Unfortunately, after a considerable delay (due to unrelated disputes in
the bills) the House-Senate conference committee dropped the Code from
the bill in March 1998. Efforts to append the measure to a suitable
piece of legislation continue in 1998 but are unlikely to succeed with
congressional elections looming. The bill will probably be reintroduced
into the next Congress in early 1999. During 1997-98, the campaign
continued to garner citizen and media support from across the country.
The New York Times endorsed the Code in a June 1997 editorial, and
Amnesty International USA became a strong advocate. The worldwide
Amnesty movement has made the establishment of a human-rights centered
arms trade Code of Conduct a priority for its USA campaign during
1998-99. Efforts to develop responsible arms policies advanced
internationally, as well. Universality is critical in combating the \"if
we don\'t sell, someone else will\" excuse for inaction. In May 1997, 15
Nobel Peace laureates-led by Oscar Arias, the former President of Costa
Rica-kicked off a global Code of Conduct campaign. The laureates are
working with a core group of internationally-focused non-governmental
organizations to advance their initiative in importing, as well as
exporting, countries. The measure might eventually be introduced into
the United Nations. Additionally, a campaign to enact a Code of Conduct
for arms transfers through the European Union received a boost when the
recently-elected British Labour Party government, which had declared its
support for an ethical dimension to British foreign policy, made good on
its pledge to introduce and secure agreement by the EU for a Code of
Conduct on arms transfers. In late May 1998 all 15 EU member states
accepted a common set of standards for weapons exports, which includes
agreement to \"take into account respect for human rights and
fundamental freedoms in the recipient country\" and to \"not issue an
export licence if there is a clearly identifiable risk that the proposed
export might be used for internal repression.\" The Clinton
administration, the US arms industry and the media are increasingly
aware of the Code of Conduct and are taking it seriously. The Aerospace
Industries Association has labeled the Code as one of its principal
targets for defeat, and the administration continues to oppose passage
of the Code (while claiming to support all four of its conditions). Many
congressional staffers are now familiar with the bill, an advance from
the not-so-distant past when every phone call to Capitol Hill required a
five minute preliminary explanation of the measure. [[Supporters have
their work cut out, since such a sweeping reform of overall US arms
export policy challenges many vested interests. But the campaign has
made steady progress over the past four years]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Here are five useful proposals to improve women's participation in
arms control]{.underline}]{.mark} and disarmament: Identify national
patterns and establish objectives. Surveying 84 multilateral meetings,
UNIDIR identified several overall patterns and trends in arms control
and disarmament diplomacy: When states can only send a single
representative, they almost always send a man. Women are typically
included as the second or, more often, third or fourth member of their
delegations. Women comprise only a third of the diplomats accredited to
arms control and disarmament forums. In smaller, more specialized
forums, the average proportion of women drops to just 20%. States that
are interested in promoting gender equality in their national
delegations would benefit from collecting their own data and conducting
a baseline assessment. After identifying their national patterns and
understanding their specific needs, [[states could]{.mark}]{.underline}
then set objectives and directives to [[improve women's
participation]{.underline}]{.mark} at the national level---for example,
[[by giving priority to women in one-person delegations. This type of
commitment could actively promote women's
participation,]{.underline}]{.mark} rather than simply adding women to
delegations. We heard positive accounts from diplomats of states that
have established gender parity targets. In their view, these top-down
decisions made people more aware of gender imbalances and provided civil
servants with practical guidelines to address asymmetries, leading to a
better work environment for women and men. [[Promote inclusive
leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}. When it comes to leadership positions,
gender imbalance is even more pronounced. UNIDIR research showed that
men are overrepresented as heads of delegations, to an even greater
degree than would be expected given the overall proportion of men in a
meeting. In 2018, 76% of heads of delegations participating in
multilateral disarmament meetings were men---higher than the 66% overall
proportion of male delegates in these forums. In all discussions,
diplomats spoke about the importance of role models and mentors who can
support and encourage women to take steps that advance their careers in
male-dominated environments. The diplomats highlighted initiatives
implemented by foreign services, such as leadership strategies and
coaching programs. [[States]{.underline}]{.mark} wishing to improve the
quality of women's participation [[could design]{.underline}]{.mark}
specific [[initiatives aimed at giving more women speaking roles in
negotiations and promoting women in leadership
positions]{.underline}]{.mark}. Another option is to have a man and a
woman alternate as the head of the delegation. At the multilateral
level, [[parties to any conference could agree on including gender as a
criterion when electing presidents or chairpersons. This would help
ensure a gender-balanced organization]{.underline}]{.mark}, featuring
both women and men at the highest level. [[Make gender considerations
part of everyday work]{.underline}]{.mark}. Diplomats told us about
individual actions they have taken to integrate gender considerations
into their day-to-day work. Some, when reporting to their respective
foreign ministries, include information regarding men's and women's
participation in events, keep track of who gets to speak in meetings,
praise gender-balanced committees, adopt a policy of declining
invitations to single-sex panels, etc. Others have started to pay
attention to language, questioning the use of the masculine form by
default and giving preference to titles that reflect inclusion (for
example, "chairperson" instead of "chairman"). It became evident that
[[diplomats can play an active role in fostering gender
considerations]{.underline}]{.mark} in diplomacy. In multilateral
meetings, they can propose and adopt agenda items that examine gender
perspectives on a given policy issue. They can make sure the language
used in resolutions is gender-responsive. They can organize gender
briefings and support side events on gender at the margins of
multilateral meetings. When acting as president of a meeting or
conference, diplomats can work with the secretariat to ensure that women
and men working with the presidency are equally represented in support
functions. [[Diplomats can include gender criteria in the sponsorship
program for delegations]{.underline}]{.mark}; and they can request the
secretariat to collect, track, and publish sex-disaggregated data and
statistics on gender balance in delegations, bodies, and panels.
[[Adjust diplomatic practice to better accommodate family
life]{.underline}]{.mark}. One of the issues brought up in all the
discussions UNIDIR hosted was the difficulty diplomats have in balancing
work with family life, and the toll that long meetings and constant
travel can take on relationships. These are issues that affect all
individuals, regardless of gender. However, because women tend to
shoulder more household responsibilities than men, an unequal division
of family tasks can place a heavier burden on women and hold them back
in their careers. In order to better accommodate family life, [[states
could ensure that meeting hours match school
schedules]{.underline}]{.mark}. This would entail a certain degree of
flexibility, as it would be necessary to adjust schedules in accordance
with the local culture. In Geneva, for example, it would make sense to
change the time of multilateral meetings, starting earlier than current
practice, which is 10 a.m., and finishing by 5 p.m. Diplomats could also
be stricter in keeping negotiations within the agreed hours. If avoiding
late-night sessions is not possible, as is sometimes the case in endgame
diplomacy, adequate warning should be given. Foreign services could also
consider assisting staff with childcare and allowing for shared,
gender-neutral parental leave. [[Ensure women and men enjoy equal
opportunities in recruitment and promotion]{.underline}]{.mark}. During
the consultations, some diplomats raised the issue of self-selection,
arguing that women often refrain from working in international security,
choosing to cover other topics. Other participants said the field of
arms control and disarmament has kept women out by rewarding
characteristics, expertise, and experience that are more commonly
associated with men (such as toughness, seriousness, risk-taking, and
military training). There are complex historic and cultural factors at
play in this discussion. Although there is no magic fix for the gaps in
gender diversity in arms control and disarmament, foreign services can
take proactive steps in recruitment and promotion processes. In order to
improve recruitment, managers can actively reach out to different groups
of potential candidates, implementing processes that minimize
unconscious bias. Foreign services can ensure that all selection panels
and final applicant pools for new positions in the organization are not
single-gender. To promote transparency and encourage all candidates,
gender-disaggregated data can be published systematically for all
recruitment and promotion rounds, showing the gender breakdown for
applications, interviews, and outcomes. In addition, foreign services
can adopt policies to help eliminate harassment; introduce mandatory
unconscious-bias training for all staff; and support a change of
perceptions and behaviors. The burden of proof. During our research, it
became evident that not all diplomats share the view of gender equality
as a prerequisite to progress on every front. Many would like to see a
stronger case for including women's voices in arms control and
disarmament diplomacy. Women, it would appear, still need to justify
their seat at the table. Participants suggested more research is
required to obtain evidence about how participation by women affects
negotiations, placing the onus on scholars and experts to prove that the
presence of women makes a difference for national and international
peace and security. Yet what evidence is there that excluding women
makes for better policy outcomes? We hope that evidence-based arguments
will open space for increased participation of women. Ultimately,
however, [[a commitment to gender equality is rooted in rights and
justice. Including women is the right thing to do.]{.underline}]{.mark}

and privacy Policy [[First, there's paid leave.]{.mark}]{.underline}
It's simple. [[Women who get paid time off after they have children can
keep their jobs and move up their career ladder, according to many
studies]{.mark}]{.underline} and anecdotal evidence from companies. The
trick here is to keep things equal. Men should receive the same time off
as women ― and they should be encouraged to take advantage of it.
Otherwise men will still be able to work more and women will lose out to
their male counterparts in hiring and promotion. Then when the baby
comes, the bills pile on. [[Access to affordable child care is critical
to keeping women]{.underline}]{.mark}, mothers, [[in the
workforce]{.underline}]{.mark}. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has made
child care a cornerstone policy proposal in her campaign to grab the
Democratic nomination for president. "We certainly hear from a lot of
pregnant women and mothers who are scared about being pushed out \[of
jobs\] and needing to work," said Sarah Brafman, a staff attorney at the
advocacy group A Better Balance. "Let's say a woman gets pregnant. If
she needs an accommodation and she gets pushed off the job, then she
loses out on income. So then she's pregnant and taking the financial
hit. If she gives birth and \[has\] no leave, again she's out of the
workforce and not able to work." These are big problems considering that
women make up around 40% of the primary or sole breadwinners in families
with children, she points out. "You look at enormous child care costs.
Families have to make a difficult choice and all of those contribute to
the gender pay gap," Brafman said. Another problem ― [[the majority of
the lowest paid workers in the country are women]{.underline}]{.mark},
making up more than half of minimum wage workers. Simply [[raising the
wage floor would help close the pay gap]{.underline}]{.mark}. All these
policies are even more crucial for single mothers. On their face, these
family-friendly policies aren't about the pay gap, but there are other
laws that do tackle equal pay head-on. [[There are efforts underway to
make it illegal to pay men more for work that is comparable to work done
by women]{.underline}]{.mark} ― for example, hotel housekeepers (mostly
women) shouldn't be paid less than hotel janitors (mostly men). New York
state on Wednesday passed a provision like this. [[There's another big
policy push around pay transparency. One big hurdle for women is simply
finding out how their pay compares to men's]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
women's soccer team, for example, can fight for higher wages because it
knows how much its male counterparts earn. Nineteen states now have laws
that ban employers from retaliating against workers who reveal their
salaries. A few years ago, employees at Google openly shared salary
information in a widely circulated spreadsheet. The information led to
raises for some. Ten states and Puerto Rico now have laws banning
employers from asking what a job applicant is currently earning ― and
two more states have legislation on the way ― thus making it harder for
pay inequities to continue. This was another facet of the pay equity law
passed in New York this week. Discrimination Laws It took a federal law
― Title IX ― to get more women playing sports in high school and
college. Arguably without that law, the women's soccer team wouldn't be
the success it is today. Other federal and state laws also prohibit
gender pay discrimination, but it is still a problem, especially for
women of color, said Bahn, whose research focuses on the issue. "When
you're at the intersection of multiple identities you get more
discrimination," she said. There's a need, then, to make pay
discrimination laws more intersectional, she added, so workers can sue
claiming pay discrimination based on race and gender combined. The
Workplace The highest paying jobs in the country require long hours and
a lot of flexibility on the part of workers ― think lawyers and bankers
and doctors and managers who are expected to devote most of their time
to the job and are compensated highly in exchange for those hours.
Women, mothers in particular, lose out on that work. In a recent New
York Times article, affluent couples explained how this works: The wife
ratchets back her career potential, taking a lower paying job that
enables her to be home when the kids need her. The husband, then, works
a grueling white collar job that rakes in the cash. The upshot is, the
man makes more money than his wife. "Couple inequality is gender
inequality," said Claudia Goldin, an economics professor at Harvard who
has studied the pay gap for decades. "Couples are in this situation
where they say we can have equity at home but it's going to cost us
something." In many cases, that cost could be thousands of dollars, she
said. Goldin said this jobs issue ― and not discrimination ― is the main
driver of the pay gap. She points out that the difference between what
men and women earn isn't very large when they first enter the job market
but widens over time as women take on more caregiving roles. Public
policies like those outlined above could help, but Goldin also notes
that a lot of countries do have these policies ― and they still have pay
gaps. In Sweden for example ― a country with enviable paid leave laws ―
women are still paid about 12% less than men. One way this changes is if
workers themselves demand change, she said. Workplaces could change the
very structure of such jobs to enable more equity. She points to
pediatricians who have figured out a way to job-share ― making their "on
call" time more manageable. Culture At the bottom of all this structural
inequality is something that's deceptively simple: sexism. Women's work
is undervalued, said Bahn. "The more women who go into a profession, the
more the pay drops." The classic example here is the job of secretary ―
a role once held by men. When women started doing these jobs, the pay
fell precipitously. "That's what we see in women's sports," she added.
"People still look at it and say it's a women's team and it's less
valuable." As the whole country celebrates the women's team's victory,
that's an argument that's becoming more and more impossible to make.

### Paycheck Fairness Act Counterplan

#### \*The United States federal government should pass the Paycheck Fairness Act

#### Paycheck Fairness Act bolsters gender equality:

In recent months, opponents of strengthening equal pay protections have
parroted a common refrain from the Trump administration and its
supporters by focusing on the fact that women gained 58 percent---or
roughly 1.5 million---of all new private sector jobs created in 2018.
They tout this singular piece of data as evidence that the economy must
be working well for women and their wages. However, this talking point
obscures and oversimplifies the diverse experiences of working
women---particularly women of color---and ignores why equal pay is so
critical to women's economic progress. [[Women's full participation in
the economy is]{.underline}]{.mark} indeed [[vital
to]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. economic growth and [[gender
equality]{.underline}]{.mark}. Yet women must also have access to
quality, well-paying jobs in which they have a fair chance in order to
succeed and maximize their contributions to their families and the
economy. [[Equal pay is central to the broad goal of improving women's
economic standing while also creating equitable workplaces that pay and
treat all women fairly. Achieving both prongs of this goal requires an
intentional focus on ensuring women's equal treatment in the
workplace---including across factors such as gender, race, ethnicity,
disability, and LGBTQ status]{.underline}]{.mark}---and ensuring women's
access to quality job opportunities. Expanding access to jobs in which
women face discrimination will do little to move them or their families
forward in the long term. [[For this reason, policymakers must make a
simultaneous commitment to equality and opportunity, as these two
principles are inextricably linked and one without the other would
result in little overall progress for women]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Understanding this relationship between equality and opportunity is
particularly important in the current conversation about the economy,
jobs, and equal pay. Wage gaps persist for women across industries A
closer look at wage differences in the industries where women gained the
most jobs in 2018 suggests a different story about how women are faring
in the economy and where interventions are needed. Analysis of monthly
jobs data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) Current Employment
Statistics survey shows that among the roughly 1.5 million private
sector jobs gained by women in 2018, slightly less than 80 percent fall
into four primary industry categories: education and health services;
professional and business services; leisure and hospitality; and
manufacturing. (see Figure 1) While women working full-time, year-round,
on average, earn 80 cents for every dollar earned by men, analysis of
data from the BLS' 2018 Current Population Survey (CPS) Annual Social
and Economic Supplement reveal that, on average, women working in three
out of these four industries---which, combined, account for more than 60
percent of jobs gained by women in 2018---experience an even wider
gender wage gap. (see Figure 2) Part-time work is also included in the
roughly 1.5 million jobs gained by women in 2018, but these jobs
actually widen the overall gender wage gap. Unfortunately, the gender
wage gap is nothing new for women. The overall gender earnings
ratio---which divides women's median earnings by men's median
earnings---has changed marginally over the past decade. Women continue
to experience pay discrimination and earn less than men. This stubborn
wage gap makes clear that women's progress in the workplace must include
both access to new jobs and intentional efforts to address persistent
pay disparities. Without an intentional focus on equal pay, new jobs for
women will continue to come with depressed wages. Moreover, it is
essential to examine pay disparities across all industries, as the wage
gap can be wider due to occupational segregation and lack of work-family
policies. Data also show that the wage gap is wider for most women of
color due to the intersection of racial, ethnic, and gender biases. In
2017, for example Latinas working full-time, year-round earned only 53
cents for every dollar earned by white, non-Hispanic men. Meanwhile,
black women and American Indian and Alaska Native women earned 61 cents
and 58 cents, respectively, for every dollar earned by white,
non-Hispanic men. The failure to pursue concrete strategies to
strengthen equal pay protections and combat discriminatory pay practices
risks imposing even larger economic impacts on many women of color, who
are disproportionately more likely to work in lower-paying jobs.
Conclusion Relying on a narrow talking point about the percentage of new
jobs going to women, while ignoring the need for concrete measures to
strengthen equal pay protections, reflects a fundamental
misunderstanding of the action steps needed to promote women's economic
security and equality. No woman---or man---should have to settle for
unequal pay in order to get a job. [[If policymakers are truly committed
to advancing women's economic opportunities, they must place equal focus
on improving women's wages and improving women's access to jobs. Support
for proposals such as the Paycheck Fairness
Act---]{.underline}]{.mark}which would limit pay secrecy, expand pay
data collection, promote greater employer accountability for pay
differences, and strengthen the investigatory tools that enforcement
agencies can use to examine employer pay practices---[[would be a
critical step forward. Addressing pay discrimination and ensuring equal
pay for women must be a top priority in every job and industry in order
to ensure that women's economic success is not merely a talking point
but also a reality]{.underline}]{.mark}.

# Capitalism Kritik vs. Gender Case

**[1NC -- Cap K]{.underline}**

#### We are in the era of late-capitalism -- identity politics and diversity now support the neoliberal system. 

**Eagleton 16**---Visiting Professor of Cultural Theory at Yale \[Terry,
"The Hubris of Culture: And the Limits of Identity Politics,"
*Commonwealth*, 15 Apr 2016, p. 19-22, Emory Libraries\]

The conventional postmodern wisdom is that this system has now taken a
cultural turn. From the rough-spoken old industrial world, we have now
evolved to capitalism with a cultural face. The role of the so-called
"creative" industries, the power of the new cultural technologies, the
prominent role of sign, image, brand, icon, spectacle, lifestyle,
fantasy, design, and advertising: all this is taken to testify to the
emergence of an "aesthetic" form of capitalism, in transit from the
material to the immaterial. What this amounts to, however, is that
[[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[incorporated culture for]{.mark}
its own [material ends]{.mark}]{.underline}, not that it has fallen
under the sway of the aesthetic, gratuitous, self-delighting, or
self-fulfilling. On the contrary, [this aestheticized mode of capitalist
production has proved more ruthlessly instrumental than
ever]{.underline}. ["Creativity,"]{.underline} which for Karl Marx and
William Morris signified the opposite of capitalist utility, [is pressed
into the service of acquisition and exploitation]{.underline}.

There is no clearer example of the way capitalism is intent on
assimilating what once seemed its opposite ("culture") than the global
decline of the universities. Along with the fall of Communism and the
Twin Towers, it ranks among the most momentous events of our age, if
somewhat less spectacular in nature. A centuries-old tradition of
[universities as centers of humane critique is currently being scuppered
by their conversion into pseudocapitalist enterprises under the sway of
a brutally philistine managerial ideology]{.underline}. Once arenas of
critical reflection, [academic institutions are being increasingly
reduced to organs of the marketplace]{.underline}, along with betting
shops and fast-food joints. [They are]{.underline} now for the most part
[in the hands of technocrats]{.underline} for whom values are largely a
matter of real estate. [A new intellectual proletariat of academics is
assessed by how far their lectures on Plato or Copernicus boost the
economy]{.underline}, while unemployed graduates constitute a kind of
lumpen intelligentsia. Students who are currently charged fees by the
year will no doubt soon find their tutors charging by the insight. In
moving some of its academic staff to new premises, one British
university recently issued an edict severely restricting their ability
to keep books in their minuscule offices. The dream of our universities'
boneheaded administrators is of a bookless and paperless environment,
books and paper being messy, crumply stuff incompatible with a gleaming
neo-capitalist wasteland consisting of nothing but machines,
bureaucrats, and security guards. Since students are also messy, crumply
stuff, the ideal would be a campus on which no such inconvenient
creatures were in sight. [The death of the humanities is now an event
waiting on the horizon]{.underline}.

What ought finally to have discredited the faith that [capitalism has
shifted to a new cultural mode]{.underline} was the financial debacle of
2008. One consequence of such upheavals is that, for an inconvenient
moment, they strip the veil of familiarity from a form of life that has
ceased to be regarded as a specific historical system. By throwing its
inner workings into relief, they allow that life-form to be framed,
objectified, and estranged. As such, it ceases to be the invisible color
of everyday life and can be seen instead as a historically recent mode
of civilization. Significantly, it is in the throes of such crises that
even those who are supposed to run the system begin for the first time
to use the word "capitalism," rather than to speak more euphemistically
of Western democracy or the Free World. They thus steal a march on some
[sectors of [the cultural left]{.mark}, which [in their]{.mark} zeal for
a [discourse of difference, diversity, identity,]{.mark} [and
marginality ceased to use the word
"capitalism"]{.mark}]{.underline}---let alone "exploitation" or
"revolution"---some decades ago. [[**Neoliberal capitalism has no
difficulty** with]{.mark} terms like **"[diversity]{.mark}" or
"inclusiveness,"** as it does with the language of class
struggle]{.underline}.

It is imprudent for the Masters of the Universe to talk of
[[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}, since in doing so they acknowledge
that their form of life is simply one among many, that [like all other
such life-forms it [has a specific origin, and]{.mark} that what was
born [can]{.mark} always [die]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It may be that
capitalism is simply human nature, but it is hard to deny that [there
was a time when there was human nature but not
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. What the crisis of [[2008
put]{.underline}]{.mark} most [[embarrassingly on
show]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, was [**[how little the system
had]{.mark} fundamentally [changed]{.mark}**[, for all the]{.mark}
excited [talk of]{.mark} lifestyle and **hybridity, [flexible
identities]{.mark}** []{.mark}and immaterial labor, rhizome-like
organizations]{.underline} and CEOs in opennecked shirts, the
disappearance of the working class and the shift from industrial labor
to information technology and the service industry. Despite these
innovations, the momentary crackup of the system revealed that [[we were
still languishing in a world of mass unemployment and]{.mark} obscenely
overpaid executives, [gross inequalities]{.mark} and squalid public
services]{.underline}, one in which the state was every bit as obedient
a tool of ruling-class interests as the most resolutely vulgar of
Marxists had ever imagined. [What was at stake was not image and icon
but gargantuan fraud and systemic plunder]{.underline}. The true
gangsters and anarchists wore pinstripe suits, and the robbers were
running the banks rather than raiding them.

[The idea of culture is]{.underline} traditionally [bound up with the
concept of distinction]{.underline}. High culture is a question of rank.
One thinks of the great hautbourgeois families portrayed by Marcel
Proust and Thomas Mann, for whom power and material wealth are
accompanied by a lofty cultural tone and bear with them certain moral
obligations. Spiritual hierarchy goes hand in hand with social
inequality. [[The aim of advanced capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}, by
contrast, [[is to **preserve inequality while abolishing
hierarchy**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In this sense, [its material base is
at odds with its cultural superstructure]{.underline}. [[You do not need
to proclaim]{.mark} your [superiority]{.mark} to other peoples [in order
to raid]{.mark} their natural [resources]{.mark}]{.underline}, as long
as by doing so you maintain the material inequalities between them and
yourself. [[Whether Americans regard themselves as superior to Iraqis
is]{.underline}]{.mark} really [[neither here nor there]{.mark}, given
that it is political and military control over an oil-rich region they
have in their sights]{.underline}. Culturally speaking, [**[late
capitalism is]{.mark}** for the most part a matter not of hierarchy but
**[hybridity]{.mark}**---of mingling, merging, and
multiplicity---[while, materially]{.mark} speaking, [the gulf between
social classes assumes ultra-Victorian proportions]{.mark}]{.underline}.
There are plenty of exponents of cultural studies who take note of the
former but not the latter. While [the sphere of consumption is
hospitable to all comers]{.underline}, the domain of property and
production remains rigidly stratified. Divisions of property and class,
however, are partly masked by the levelling, demotic, spiritually
promiscuous culture in which they are set, as they were not in the era
of Proust and Mann. In contrast to that stately milieu, cultural and
material capital now begin to split apart. The brokers, jobbers,
operators, and speculators who float to the top of the system in their
spiritual weightlessness are hardly remarkable for their aesthetic
wisdom.

[The [breaking down of cultural hierarchies is]{.mark} clearly to be
[welcomed]{.mark}]{.underline}. For the most part, [[**however**, it
is]{.mark} less the upshot of a genuinely democratic spirit than [an
**effect of the commodity form**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which levels
existing values rather than contesting them in the name of alternative
priorities. Indeed, [it represents an assault less on cultural
supremacism than on the notion of value as such]{.underline}. The very
act of discrimination becomes suspect. Not only does it involve
exclusion, but it must inevitably imply the possibility of a superior
vantage point, which seems offensive to the egalitarian spirit. Those
who prefer Billie Holliday to Liam Gallagher (and what right have they
to judge in any case?) are simply being elitist. Since nothing is more
common than evaluation in pubs and sports stadiums, this aversion to
ranking is itself an elitist posture. Distinctions give way to
differences. The cuisine of Florence, Arizona, is neither better nor
worse than that of Florence, Italy---simply different. To discriminate
is unjustly to demean one thing while falsely absolutizing another. To
judge that Donald Trump has less humility than Pope Francis is to thrust
Trump self-righteously into the outer darkness, thereby flouting the
absolute value of inclusivity; and who am I to arrogate such authority?
From what odiously Olympian standpoint has one the right to pontificate
that feeding a gerbil is preferable to microwaving it?

The bogus populism of the commodity---its warm-hearted refusal to rank,
exclude, and discriminate---is based on a blank indifference to
absolutely everyone. Careless for the most part of distinctions of
class, race, and gender, impeccably even-handed in its favors, it will
yield itself, in the spirit of a whorehouse, to anyone with the cash to
buy it. A similar [indifference underlies the historic [advance of
multiculturalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. [If the human species now has a
chance, for the first time in its history, to become thoroughly hybrid,
it [is]{.mark} largely [**because the capitalist market** will buy the
labor-power of anyone willing to sell it]{.mark}, whatever their
cultural origins]{.underline}. There are, to be sure, some transitional
tensions at work here. At present, it is the economy that is
promiscuously open to all comers, and a certain current of racist
culture that wishes to discriminate. [[A capitalist market]{.mark}
accustomed to being culturally embedded in the nation state, whose
military firepower and social homogeneity served it well over the
centuries, [now pitches different ethnic groups
together]{.mark}]{.underline}; and the racist and neo-fascist forces
that this unleashes threaten to splinter the national cohesion on which
a globalized economic system continues to depend.

For the moment, then, culture and the economy are in some sense out of
synchrony. While the latter can go global, it is not so simple for the
former to wax cosmopolitan. One can, to be sure, hang around polyglot
cafés or enjoy the music of a score of nations, but
[[culture]{.underline}]{.mark} in this sense of the term [[lacks]{.mark}
the [depth in which values]{.mark} and convictions [need to be
rooted]{.mark}]{.underline}. There are indeed international allegiances
for which men and women have been ready to die, not least in the
socialist tradition; but culture, as Edmund Burke was aware, draws much
of its resilience from local loyalties. It is hard to imagine the
citizens of Bradford or Bruges throwing themselves on the barricades
crying "Long live the European Union!" Far from producing citizens of
the world, [transnational capitalism tends to breed parochialism and
insecurity among a large swathe of those subject to its sway; and it is
toward racism and chauvinism, not into cosmopolitan cafés, that this
insecurity is likely to impel them]{.underline}.

While some forms of culture have increased in significance, others have
diminished. Nobody believes any longer that art can fill the shoes of
the Almighty. [[Culture as a critique]{.mark} of civilization [has
been]{.mark} increasingly [eroded, undermined]{.mark} among other things
[by the postmodern prejudice that]{.mark} any such [critique must
address itself to an illusory social totality from an]{.mark} equally
[illusory standpoint of absolute knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}. It has
also come under siege from the intellectual treason of the universities.
The critical or utopian dimensions of the concept of culture are rapidly
declining. If **[[culture signifies a corporate way of
life]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as it does when we speak of deaf culture,
beach culture, police culture, café culture, and so on, then it is hard
for it to serve at the same time as a yardstick by which to assess such
forms of life, or to evaluate social existence in general. [So-called
[identity politics are not remarkable for their self-critical
spirit]{.mark}.]{.underline} The point of engaging in, say, English folk
culture is to affirm English folksiness, not to question it. Nobody
becomes a Morris dancer in order to satirize the whole sorry business.

At the same time, there are political cultures (gay, feminist, ethnic,
musical, and so on) that are indeed deeply critical of the status quo.
They inherit the dissenting impulse of Kulturkritik while jettisoning
its spiritual elitism. [[They]{.mark} also [reject]{.mark}]{.underline}
its abstract [[utopianism for a specific way of
life]{.underline}]{.mark}. If they challenge the patrician remoteness of
the tradition that passes from Friedrich Schiller to D. H. Lawrence,
with its disdain for modernity, they also differ from those corporate
life-forms that exist simply to affirm a particular social identity,
rather than to cast a cold eye on the social order as a whole. [[Nobody
but the **most sorely misguided of citizens becomes a Morris dancer in
order to overthrow capitalism**, whereas many a feminist has greeted the
prospect with acclaim]{.underline}]{.mark}. Political cultures of this
kind combine critique with solidarity in something like the style of the
traditional labor movement.

Yet [though [identity politics]{.mark} and multiculturalism can be
radical forces, they [are not]{.mark}]{.underline} for the most part
[[revolutionary]{.mark} ones]{.underline}. [Some]{.underline} of these
political currents [have largely abandoned their hopes]{.underline} in
this regard, [while others never entertained them in the first
place]{.underline}. [[They differ]{.underline}]{.mark} in this respect
[[from the powers that drove the British from India and]{.mark} the
[Belgians from the Congo]{.mark}]{.underline}. Those campaigns were
quite properly a matter of expulsion and exclusion, not in the first
place of plurality and inclusivity. [They]{.underline} also
**[[envisaged a world beyond the horizon of capitalist
reality]{.underline}]{.mark}**, even if those visions were to be for the
most part thwarted. [Today's [cultural politics]{.mark}]{.underline}, by
contrast, [[is not]{.mark} generally [given to challenging those
priorities]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[It speaks the language of gender,
identity]{.mark}, marginality, diversity, [and oppression, **but
not**]{.mark} for the most part [the idiom of state, property,
class-struggle]{.mark}, ideology, [and
exploitation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Roughly speaking, [it is the
difference between anti-colonialism and postcolonialism]{.underline}.
[[Cultural politics]{.mark} of this kind are in one sense the very
opposite of elitist notions of culture]{.underline}. [Yet they
[share]{.mark} in their own way that [elitism's overvaluing of cultural
affairs, as well as its distance from]{.mark} the prospect of
[fundamental change]{.mark}]{.underline}.

What, finally, of the so-called War on Terror? Is it not here that we
should look for the persistence of cultural questions in political
society? Perhaps one might see the collapse of the World Trade Center as
a surreal explosion of archaic cultural forces at the very heart of
modern civilization. The clash between Western capitalism and radical
Islam, however, is primarily a geopolitical affair, not a cultural or
religious one, rather as the recent conflict in Northern Ireland had
little to do with religious conviction. There has been much talk in the
region of the need for an amicable encounter between what is blandly
known as "the two cultural traditions," Unionist and nationalist. It is
thus that [a history of injustice and inequality]{.underline}, of
Protestant supremacy and Catholic subjugation, [can be converted into an
innocuous question of alternative cultural identities]{.underline}.
[[Culture becomes a]{.mark} convenient [way of **displacing
politics**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

As in the case of revolutionary nationalism, culture may supply some of
the terms on which material and political battles are joined, but it
does not constitute their substance. By and large, fundamentalism is the
creed of those who feel abandoned and humiliated by modernity, and the
forces responsible for this pathological state of mind, like those that
give birth to multiculturalism, are far from cultural in themselves. In
fact, [[the]{.mark} central [questions that confront]{.mark} a
[humanity]{.mark} moving into the new millennium [are not cultural
ones]{.mark} at all]{.underline}. [[They are]{.mark} far more mundane
and [material]{.mark} than that]{.underline}. [[War, hunger, drugs,
arms, genocide, disease, ecological disaster]{.mark}: all of these have
their cultural aspects, but [culture is not the core of
them]{.mark}]{.underline}. If those who speak of culture cannot do so
without inflating the concept, it is perhaps better for them to remain
silent.

#### Focusing on gender distracts from a class-based focus---a superior means of challenging oppression.

Laura T. **Kessler, 2011** (professor of law @ University of Utah,
Seattle University Law Review, Spring 2011, "CROWDSOURCING THE
WORK-FAMILY DEBATE: A COLLOQUY," Accessed via Academic Lexis/Nexis, May
26, 2011)

Finally, Williams suggests that [[we need to shift away from a focus on
gender and pay more attention to class dynamics if we are to make any
headway in reshaping America\'s system]{.underline}]{.mark} of family
supports. [[This shift will require us to understand class in new
ways]{.underline}]{.mark}. Williams offers two innovations in this
regard. First, she suggests that we need to focus not just on the poor,
but also on the \"Missing Middle\" -- Americans who are \"one sick child
away from being fired.\" Second, [[Williams asks us to see class
divisions as a cultural problem as much as an economic one. She sees a
gaping cultural rift between white working-class and
professional-managerial class Americans that needs to be
addressed,]{.underline}]{.mark} and she describes the rift in poignant
detail. She argues that [[in order to recreate the New Deal
coalition]{.underline}]{.mark} between workers, African Americans, and
professional elites, [[we need to change the dynamics of everyday
politics through cross-class cultural understanding and gestures of
mutual respect.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Two ideas voiced in the present discussion impress the urgency of the
need for a left party oriented toward communism: racism (Buck 2015) and
the Anthropocene (Healy 2015).

[[Given anthropogenic climate change, the stakes of]{.mark} contemporary
[politics are]{.mark} almost unimaginably [high]{.mark}.]{.underline}
They range [from]{.underline} the [continued investment in extractive
industries and fossil fuels constitutive of the carbon-combustion
complex]{.underline} (see Oreskes and Conway 2014), to [the
[dislocations accompanying mass migration in the wake of floods and
droughts to the racist response of states]{.mark}]{.underline} outside
what Christian Parenti (2011, 9) calls the "Tropic of Chaos" (the band
around the "belt of economically and politically battered post-colonial
states girding the planet's mid-latitudes," where climate change is
"beginning to hit hard"), [[all the way to]{.mark} human
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}. That one city, state, or country
brings carbon emissions under control---while certainly a step in the
right direction---may be irrelevant from the standpoint of overall
warming. Perhaps its carbon-emitting industries were shipped elsewhere.
Perhaps another country chose to expand its own drilling operations.
Climate change forces us to acknowledge that we can't build new worlds
(Helepololei). [We live in one world, the heating up of which threatens
humans and other species. Not all communities, economies, or ways of
[life]{.mark} are compatible. Those premised on [industries and
practices]{.mark} that [continue to contribute to]{.mark} planetary
[warming have to change significantly]{.mark}, and soon. [Forcing that
change is]{.mark} the [political]{.mark} challenge of our
time]{.underline}.

[[Given the]{.mark} persistence of racialized violence and the
[operation of the state as an instrument for the maintenance]{.mark} not
only [of capitalist]{.mark} modes of [production]{.mark} but also
[and]{.mark} concomitantly of [racialized hierarchy, the challenges of
organizing politically across issues and identities are]{.mark} almost
insurmountably [daunting]{.mark}]{.underline}. [No wonder [the Left
resorts to moralism and self-care]{.mark}]{.underline} instead. [[It's
easier to catalog difference than]{.mark} it is [to build up a Left
strong enough to exercise power]{.mark}]{.underline}, [especially given
the traversal of state power by transnational corporations, trade, and
treaties. It's also easier to go along with the dominant ideology of
[individualism]{.mark}, which [enjoins us]{.mark} first and foremost [to
look after ourselves, than]{.mark} it is [to]{.mark} put ourselves aside
and [focus on formulating a strategy for using collective power
to]{.mark} occupy, [reconfigure]{.mark}, and redirect
[institutions]{.mark}]{.underline} at multiple levels. Here again, [not
every vision of community is compatible with every other. Those premised
on fantasies of racial, religious, ethnic, or linguistic purity directly
oppose those premised on diversity]{.underline}. Those premised on
reproducing structures of class hierarchy directly oppose those
insisting on equality. If something like a party of the radical Left can
stretch beyond Greece and Spain, if it can be imagined in North America,
it will only be possible as a combination of communism, antiracism, and
climate activism. I use "red, black, and green" as a heuristic for the
coalition of concerns necessary for such a party. I invoke the heuristic
here to double down against critics who prefer a thousand alternatives
to the party form. [[A thousand alternatives]{.underline}]{.mark} (see
Healy 2015) [[is no alternative. It leaves the political system]{.mark}
we have]{.underline}---[the one that puts all its force [behind the
preservation of capitalist]{.mark} class
[interests]{.mark}---[intact]{.mark}. Some [ideas need to be chosen,
systematized into a program, and defended]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Consciously reiterating the colors of the Black Liberation Flag, the
red, black, and green heuristic positions itself within the histories of
communist, people's, and anticolonial struggles. Left Unity in the UK
uses red, black, and green in their logo to suggest a similar
constellation. The colors don't have a fixed meaning; they have appeared
differently in the histories of emancipatory egalitarian struggle. In
recent struggles, red suggests a politics against debt, austerity, and
corporate personhood and allies with anticapitalism and communism as
well. Black pays tribute to the IWW, anarchists, black power, and
movements against aggressive policing, incarceration, and the murder of
African Americans. Green points to climate justice, an approach to
climate change that exceeds capitalist emphases on carbon markets and
green commodities to encompass the dismantling of the carbon-based
economy and the global redistribution of wealth.

The three colors should not be read as three separate issues or groups.
They should rather be understood as a kind of mutually supporting and
inflecting scaffold. An equitable response to the changing climate, for
example, is incompatible with the continuation of capitalism. A
communism anchored in extractive industry is incom- patible with the
mitigation of and adaptation to climate change. Antiracism directs our
attention to those most likely to be exploited and sacrificed in
market-driven schemes to address climate change. It also marks the fact
of [the history of [divisions within the Left]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[have stood in the way of]{.mark} our forging [collective
counterpower]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[Here and now, movements are pushing the organizational convergence of
communist, climate, and race politics]{.underline}. Moral Mondays, the
ongoing protests in North Carolina, bring together an array of political
concerns around racial justice, cuts to public services, and the
environment. These protests include marches and acts of civil
disobedience. The heartbreaking reminder that "Black lives matter" calls
for the abolition of structures of institutionalized power that continue
to impoverish, imprison, and kill black people everywhere. Protests in
Ferguson, Missouri, in the wake of the murder of Michael Brown, have
turned the spotlight on the militarization of the police and the buildup
of state forces for the defense of the wealthy and white against the
proletarianized---poor, brown, and black. Similar buildups of police
borders in the United States and abroad attempt to push back the many on
the move in response to the "catastrophic convergence" of decades of
violent expropriation and climate change (Parenti 2011). The demand for
climate justice places the economic inequalities accompanying and
constitutive of capitalist "development" at the center of global
discussions of climate change. Images from New Orleans after Hurricane
Katrina and terms like "sacrifice zones" help articulate the two. Every
time an activist reminds us that issues can't be considered in isolation
or every time a student repeats the mantra of intersectionality, the
Left is instructing itself to make connections and formulate a politics
capable of grasping complexity and of changing the world. The party is a
form for that connecting. It provides a location where we see and relate
to ourselves as comrades, as solidary members of a fighting collective.

#### Vote neg to endorse boring politics -- discourses of individual critique and resistance derail incremental structural changes necessary to combat the encroachment of the market.

**Frank 12**---Political analyst, historian, journalist and columnist
for Harper\'s Magazine \[Thomas, "the Precinct Station: How theory met
practice ...and drove it absolutely crazy,"
[http://www.thebaffler.com/past/to_the_precinct_station](http://www.thebaffler.com/past/to_the_precinct_station))\]

[[Occupy]{.underline}]{.mark} itself [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} pretty
much [[gone]{.underline}]{.mark}. It was [evicted from Zuccotti
Park]{.underline} about two months after it began---[[an utterly
predictable outcome]{.mark} for]{.underline} [which the
group]{.underline} seems to have [made inadequate
preparation]{.underline}. [[OWS couldn't]{.mark} bring itself to [come
up with a]{.mark} real [set of demands]{.mark}]{.underline} until after
it got busted, when it finally agreed on a single item. With the
exception of some residual groups here and there populated by the usual
activist types, [OWS has]{.underline} today pretty much [fizzled
out]{.underline}. The media storm that once surrounded it has blown off
to other quarters.

Pause for a moment and [compare this]{.underline} record of
accomplishment [to]{.underline} that of [[Occupy's evil twin, the Tea
Party movement]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the larger right-wing revival
of which it is a part. Well, under the urging of this trumped-up protest
movement, [the Republican Party [proceeded to win a majority in
the]{.mark} U.S. [House]{.mark} of Representatives; in the state
legislatures of the nation it took some six hundred seats from the
Democrats]{.underline}; as of this writing it is still purging
Republican senators and congressmen deemed insufficiently conservative
and has even succeeded in having one of its own named as the GOP's
vice-presidential candidate.

The question that the books under consideration here seek to answer is:
What is the magic formula that made OWS so successful? But it's exactly
the wrong question. What we need to be asking about Occupy Wall Street
is: [Why did this effort fail?]{.underline} How did OWS blow all the
promise of its early days? [Why do even [the]{.mark} most popular
[efforts of the Left come to be mired in]{.mark} a gluey swamp of
academic talk and [pointless antihierarchical
posturing]{.mark}?]{.underline}

The action certainly started with a bang. When the occupation of
Zuccotti Park began, in September 2011, the OWS cause was overwhelmingly
popular; indeed, as Todd Gitlin points out, hating Wall Street may well
have been the most popular left-wing cause since the thirties.
Inequality had reached obscene levels, and it was no longer the act of a
radical to say so. The bank bailouts of the preceding years had made it
obvious that government was captured by organized money. Just about
everyone resented Wall Street in those days; just about everyone was
happy to see someone finally put our fury in those crooks' overpaid
faces. People flocked to the OWS standard. Cash donations poured in; so
did food and books. Celebrities made appearances in Zuccotti, and the
media began covering the proceedings with an attentiveness it rarely
gives to leftist actions.

But these accounts, with a few exceptions here and there, misread that
overwhelming approval of Occupy's cause as an approval of the movement's
mechanics: the camping out in the park, the way food was procured for an
army of protesters, the endless search for consensus, the showdowns with
the cops, the twinkles. These things, almost every writer separately
assumes, are what the Occupy phenomenon was really about. These are the
details the public hungers to know.

[The building of a "community"]{.underline} in Zuccotti Park, for
example, [is a point of]{.underline} special [emphasis]{.underline}.
Noam Chomsky's thoughts epitomize the genre when he tells us that "one
of the main achievements" of the movement "has been to create
communities, real functioning communities of mutual support, democratic
interchange," et cetera. The reason this is important, he continues, is
because Americans "tend to be very isolated and neighborhoods are broken
down, community structures have broken down, people are kind of alone."
How building such "communities" helps us to tackle the power of high
finance is left unexplained, as is Chomsky's implication that a city of
eight million people, engaged in all the complexities of modern life,
should learn how humans are supposed to live together by studying an
encampment of college students.

The actual sins of Wall Street, by contrast, are much less visible. For
example, when you read Occupying Wall Street, the work of a team of
writers who participated in the protests, you first hear about the
subject of predatory lending when a sympathetic policeman mentions it in
the course of a bust. The authors themselves never bring it up.

And [if you want [to know how the people]{.mark} in Zuccotti [intended
to block the banks' agenda]{.mark}]{.underline}---how they [intended to
stop predatory lending]{.underline}, for example---[[you]{.mark} have
truly [come to the wrong place]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Not
because it's hard to figure out how to stop predatory lending, but
[[because]{.underline}]{.mark} the way the [[Occupy]{.underline}]{.mark}
campaign is depicted in these books, it [seems to have [had no intention
of doing anything **except building "communities"**]{.mark} **in public
spaces**]{.underline} and inspiring mankind with its noble refusal to
have leaders.

Unfortunately, though, [[that's not enough]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Building a democratic movement culture is essential for movements on the
left, but [it's also just a starting point]{.underline}. [Occupy never
evolved beyond it]{.underline}. [It did not call for a subtreasury
system, like the Populists did]{.underline}. It didn't lead a strike (a
real one, that is), or a sit-in, or a blockade of a recruitment center,
or a takeover of the dean's office. The IWW free-speech fights of a
century ago look positively Prussian by comparison.

[With Occupy,]{.underline} the horizontal [[culture was
everything]{.mark}. "The process is the message,"]{.underline} as the
protesters used to say and as most of the books considered here largely
concur. The aforementioned camping, the cooking, the general-assembling,
the filling of public places: that's what Occupy was all about. [Beyond
that there seems to have been virtually no strategy to speak of, no
agenda to transmit to the world]{.underline}.

Whether or not to have demands, you might recall, was something that
Occupy protesters debated hotly among themselves in the days when Occupy
actually occupied something. Reading these books a year later, however,
that debate seems to have been consensed out of existence. [Virtually
none of the authors reviewed]{.underline} here [will say]{.underline}
forthrightly that [the failure to generate demands was a tactical
mistake]{.underline}. On the contrary: the quasi-official account of the
episode ([Occupy]{.underline}ing Wall Street) [laughs off demands as a
fetish object of]{.underline} literal-minded [media types]{.underline}
who stupidly crave hierarchy and chains of command. Chris Hedges tells
us that demands were something required only by "the elites, and their
mouthpieces in the media." Enlightened people, meanwhile, are supposed
to know better; demands imply the legitimacy of the adversary, meaning
the U.S. government and its friends, the banks. [Launching a [protest
with no]{.mark} formal [demands]{.mark} is [thought to be a]{.mark}
great [accomplishment]{.mark}, a gesture of surpassing democratic
virtue]{.underline}.

And [here we come to the basic contradiction of the
campaign]{.underline}. [[To protest Wall Street]{.underline}]{.mark} in
2011 [was to protest]{.underline}, obviously, the [outrageous financial
misbehavior that gave us the Great Recession;]{.underline} it [[was to
protest the political power of money]{.underline}]{.mark}, which gave us
the bailouts[;]{.underline} it was to protest the [runaway compensation
practices]{.underline} that have turned our society's productive labor
into bonuses for the 1 percent. All three of [these
catastrophes]{.underline}, however, [were brought on by [deregulation
and tax-cutting]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[by a philosophy of liberation
as anarchic]{.mark} in its rhetoric [as Occupy]{.mark} was in
reality]{.underline}. Check your premises, Rand-fans: [it was the
bankers' own uprising against the hated state that wrecked the American
way of life]{.underline}.

[[Nor does it require
**poststructuralism**]{.mark}**-leading-through-anarchism** [to]{.mark}
understand how to [reverse these developments]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[You do it by **rebuilding a powerful and competent regulatory
state**]{.underline}]{.mark}. You do it **[by [rebuilding the labor
movement]{.mark}]{.underline}**. You do it **[[with
bureaucracy]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Occupiers often seemed aware of this. Recall what you heard so
frequently from protesters' lips back in the days of September 2011:
[[Restore]{.underline}]{.mark} the old
[[Glass-Steagall]{.underline}]{.mark} divide between investment and
commercial banks, they insisted. [[Bring back big government]{.mark}!
Bring back safety! Bring back boredom!]{.underline}

But that's no way to fire the imagination of the world. So, how do you
maintain the carnival while secretly lusting for the CPAs? [By
indefinitely suspending the obvious next step]{.underline}. [By [having
no demands]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Demands would have signaled that

[[Anti-radicalism]{.mark} is]{.underline} inherently [elitist and
anti-democratic]{.underline}. [It [assumes]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[everyone]{.underline}]{.mark}, regardless of status, [[has access to
channels of political]{.mark} [and economic decision-making, and can
participate in]{.mark} [meaningful ways]{.mark} to address personal or
collective needs.]{.underline} [**[It overlooks the exclusion of vast
segments of the population from decisions that most impact their lives
and the unequal access to social resources]{.mark} that necessitate,
that impel, radical changes.** [Activists]{.mark}, as well as
sociologists and criminologists, [must]{.mark} defend radicalism from
below as the necessary orientation to [struggle]{.mark} against
injustice, exploitation, and oppression and]{.underline} **[[for
alternative social relations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Actions should
be assessed not according to a legal moral framework provided by and
reinforced by state capital]{.underline}]{.mark}** (for their own
benefit). Assessment should be made on real impacts in ending (or
hastening the end of) injustice, exploitation, and oppression, on the
weakening of state capital. As Martin Luther King suggested, a riot is
simply the language of the unheard. Self-righteous moralizing and
reference to legal authority, parroting the voices of state capital, is
an abdication of social responsibility for activists. For sociologists
and criminologists it is an abandonment of the sociological imagination
which in its emphasis on getting to the roots of issues has always been
radical (in the non-hegemonic sense). [Critical thinkers and actors of
all stripes must defend this radicalism. They must become radicals
themselves. **[Debates]{.mark} [should focus on the
effectiveness]{.mark} [of perspectives and practices]{.mark} [in getting
to the roots of social problems]{.mark}, of uprooting
power.**]{.underline} **[[They should not center on]{.mark} [fidelity to
the law or]{.mark} [bourgeois morality]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [They
should not be constrained by the lack of imagination of participants or
by the sense that the best of all worlds is the world that power has
proposed.]{.underline} Again, [[radicalism]{.underline}]{.mark} is not a
tactic, an act, an event. It [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} not a matter of
extremes, in a world that takes horrifying extremes for granted. It is
[[an]{.underline} [orientation]{.underline}]{.mark} [to the
world]{.underline}. [The features of radicalism are determined by, and
in, specific contexts.]{.underline} [[This is the case]{.mark} now [in
the context of]{.mark} mass mobilizations, even popular [uprisings
against statist]{.mark} austerity [offensives in the service of]{.mark}
neoliberal [capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[Radicalism]{.underline}]{.mark} always **[[threatens to overflow
attempts to contain it.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [It is because it
advances understanding-poses social injustice in stark relief-that it is
by nature re/productive]{.underline}. It is, in current terms, viral.

**Gunder et al. '9** (Michael, Aukland University senior planning
lecturer, 2009, Planning in Ten Words or Less: A Lacanian Entanglement
with Spatial Planning pgs 111-2)

[[The hegemonic network]{.underline}]{.mark}, or bloc, initially
[[shapes]{.mark} the [debates and draws on]{.mark} appropriate [policies
of desired success]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as the needs of bohemians,
knowledge clusters, or talented knowledge workers, as to what
constitutes their desired enjoyment (cobblestones, chrome and
cappuccinos at sidewalk cafes) and what is therefore lacking in local
competitiveness. In tum, [this defines what is blighted and
dysfunctional and in need of]{.underline} economic, spatial
[planning]{.underline}, or other, remedy. [Such an argument is
predicated on a logic]{.underline}, or more accurately a rhetoric, [that
a lack of a particular defined type of enjoyment, or
competitiveness]{.underline} (for surely they are one and the same) [is
inherently unhealthy for the aggregate social body. Lack and its
resolution are]{.underline} generally presented as [technical, rather
than political issues.]{.underline} Consequently,
[technocrats]{.underline} in partnership with their \"˜dominant
stakeholders\` can [ensure the impression of rationally seeking to
produce happiness for the many whilst, of course, achieving their
stakeholders\' specific interests]{.underline} (Gunder and Hillier
2007a, 469). The current [post-democratic\` milieu facilitates the above
[through **avoidance of critical policy debate challenging favored
orthodox positions and policy approaches**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Consideration of policy deficiencies, or [alternative
solutions]{.mark}, [are **eradicated from political debate**]{.mark} so
that while token institutions of liberal democracy\' are retained
conflicting positions and arguments are negated]{.underline}
(Stavrakakis 2003, 59). [Consequently, the safe names in the field who
feed the policy orthodoxy are]{.underline} repeatedly [used or their
work drawn upon by different stakeholders, while [more **critical voices
are silenced** by their inability to shape policy
debates\']{.mark}]{.underline} (Boland 2007, 1032).
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} economic development or spatial planning
[[policy analyst thus continues to **partition reality**]{.mark}
ideologically [by deploying]{.mark} only [the orthodox]{.mark}
\"successful" or [\"best practice"]{.mark}]{.underline} economic
development or spatial [planning responses.]{.underline} [**[This
further maintains the]{.mark} dominant, or [hegemonic]{.mark}, [status
quo]{.mark}** [while providing \"˜**a cover and shield against critical
thought**]{.mark} by acting in the manner of a \"buffer\" isolating the
political]{.underline} [held from any research that is independent and
radical in its conception as in its implications for public
policy\']{.underline} (Wacquant 2004, 99). At the same time, [adoption
of the hegemonic orthodoxy tends to generate similar policy
responses]{.underline} [for every competing local area or
city-region]{.underline}, largely resulting in a zero-sum game (Blair
and Kumar 1997).

**Refuse the AFF's knowledge production-markets create subservient

**De Angelis**, East London political economy professor, **2004**

(Massimo, "Separating the Doing and the Deed: Capital and the Continuous
Character of Enclosures", Historical Materialism; 2004, Vol. 12 Issue 2,
p57-87, ebsco)

[[If capital encloses, it cannot do it without a corresponding
discourse]{.underline}]{.mark}. This discourse however, is not
crystal-clear, but fuzzy and takes many names. [While it has to reﬂect
the telos and objectives of capital by promoting separation, at the same
time, it has to discourage alternative projects]{.underline} and
objectives, [especially those that are based on a movement of direct
association between waged and unwaged producers]{.underline} and social
wealth. **[[The discourse of enclosures]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in other
words, **[[must present itself not as a]{.underline}]{.mark}** negative
**[[force]{.underline}]{.mark}**, one **[[that]{.underline}]{.mark}**
separates, brutalises, and **[[disempowers]{.underline}]{.mark}**;
**[[but]{.underline}]{.mark}**, on the contrary, it also **[[has to wear
the mantle of rationality, and project a vision]{.underline}]{.mark}**
of the future [**[that makes sense to a multiplicity]{.underline}**
**[of]{.underline}**]{.mark} concrete
[**[subjects]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Thus, we may understand enclosure
in terms of a rationale of capital accumulation and indifference to
social needs (such as common access to entitlements or knowledge). But
enclosure is endorsed in the meta-discourse of economics, through talk
of 'trade liberalisation', 'antiinﬂation' policies, 'ﬁscal
responsibility', 'debt management', and so on. We can also cite 'growth
prospects', 'democracy', 'transparency', 'accountability' and 'good
governance'. This, I would argue, is not simply a smokescreen.
[[Enclosures are not just about taking resources away from
people]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[but the ﬁrst step towards attempting to
deﬁne new subjects normalised to the capitalist
market.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [Capital does not enclose simply in order
to rob, but also so as to integrate the social body]{.underline} in
particular ways. [The integration of the social body predicated on
enclosures requires the constitution of social subjects who are
normalised to the commodity-form, that is to stratiﬁed
enclosures]{.underline}. The construction of 'economic man' normalised
to markets and enclosures is the result of policies emerged from
theoretical frameworks such as economics which work on the assumption of
such a normalised subject.

**[A2: Jarvis]{.underline}**

**Jarvis misreads and essentializes critical scholarship making his
claims worthless**

Michael J **Shapiro**, Professor of Politial Science at the University
of Hawaii. International Studies Association review of Books **2001** p.
126-128

D. S. L. Jarvis\'s International Relations and the Challenge of
Postmodern­ism: Defending the Discipline constitutes a radical
alternative to Cochran\'s practice of critique. Manifesting a serious
allergy to critique and especially to what he calls \"postmodernism,\"
[Jarvis presumes that he must defend tradi­tional, neopositivist
IR]{.underline} against (in the words of the book jacket) \"the various
postmodern and poststructuralist theories currently sweeping the
discipline of International Relations.\"To put the matter simply at the
outset**,** [[Jarvis appears]{.mark} to be almost [entirely ignorant
of]{.mark} the philosophical predicates of the [critical IR]{.mark}
literature he attacks]{.underline}**.** [[He invents a model of thought
that he finds vulnerable]{.underline} [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [then
[proceeds with his]{.mark} method of [argumentation, mostly to scoff at
the enemy he has invented]{.mark}.]{.underline} **But** [Jarvis\'s
scoffing amounts to whistling in the dark]{.underline}**.** He has
entered a field of critique with predicates that are mysterious to him,
and he shows signs of being genuinely anxious about the consequences of
critical work**.**[The monster Jarvis creates is a work of
fiction]{.underline}**, for** [he begins with the pre­sumption that
postmodern orientations are \"sweeping\" and therefore threaten­ing the
discipline]{.underline}**.** (I estimate that roughly one percent of the
papers at the annual meeting of the International Studies Association
reference postructural­ist philosophy.) Returning to the Victorian genre
of Gothic fiction in which the constitutive practice involves two
primary roles---the monster and the victim---Jarvis portrays Richard
Ashley as the Frankenstein monster and the victim as the entire IR
discipline. Moreover**,** [Jarvis\'s overwrought style of
characteriza­tion of the dangers of postmodern IR fits Gothic fiction\'s
motivational profile as well]{.underline}**.** As is noted in Fred
Botting\'s treatment of the genre: \"The terrors and horrors of
transgression in Gothic writing become powerful means to reassert the
values of society, virtue and propriety. . . . They warn of dangers by
putting them in their darkest and most threatening form**\" (p.
5).**[Why fiction? [Jarvis\' makes \"the
postmodern]{.mark}]{.underline}**\" (**[which he seems to know primarily
on the basis of rumor]{.underline}**, for** [most of his citations are
not to postructur­alist texts but to thinkers hostile to
them]{.underline}**)** [[an elastic category that applies to
everything]{.mark} that he perceives to be antagonistic to his
pre-Kantian empiricism.]{.underline} It encompasses most of feminist IR
and anything that uses interpretive method. [Although the use of a
deconstructive mode]{.underline} **of critique** [is extremely
rare]{.underline} in international studies (the major practitioner is
David Campbell), [Jarvis fre­quently uses the term \"deconstruction\" as
a synonym for postmodernist method]{.underline}**.** He assumes, without
showing any evidence that he has read a word of Jacques Derrida\'s
writings, that deconstruction is hostile to theory building and is
opposed to all forms of affirmation. This characterization is belied by
Derrida\'s state‑ments and demonstrations and by Campbell\'s
deconstruction-inspired writing on war, security, and the ethics of
responsibility. Symptomatic of his woeful ignorance of critical work in
general, Jarvis refers at one point to the expression \"structure of
feeling\" as a \"postmodern phrase\" (p. 32). Structure of feeling is
initiated in the work of Raymond Williams, the late (and famous---though
not sufficiently to alert Jarvis) Marxist literary critic whose work
cannot be remotely related to poststructuralist critique and has
inspired such prominent postmod­ernism bashers as Terry
Eagleton.Jarvis\'s ignorance is not confined to contemporary critical
interpretive theory (postmodern or otherwise); it even extends to the
neoempiricist philosophy of science. For example, he chides
postmodernists for holding the outrageous view that theorizing
constitutes fact (p. 27), while he wants to uphold a model in which the
integrity of theory---in international studies or elsewhere---requires
that the domains of theory and fact be understood as radically separate.
One need not resort to a Foucauldian treatment of discourse as event or
a Deleuzian [critique of representational thinking to challenge
Jarvis\'s approach to theory]{.underline}**.** [[Jarvis\'s
view]{.underline}]{.mark} **of the theory--data relationship** [[was
seriously impeached by enough neoempiricist philosophers]{.mark} by
the]{.underline} **19**[60s [to field a softball
team]{.mark}]{.underline} (among the heavy hitters in the starting
lineup would be Willard V. Quine, Patrick Suppes, and Norwood Russell
Hanson)**.**[[The critical work for which Jarvis has contempt is not the
threat he imag­ines to \"the discipline,\"]{.mark} unless we construct
the IR discipline as a trained inat­tention to the problematics, within
which the work of theory proceeds]{.underline}**. The** [writings
of]{.underline} **Michel** [Foucault]{.underline} (some of whose work
Jarvis seems to have read) have implications for a critical and
affirmative perspective that does not com­promise the kind of theory
building that IR empiricists do. It [extends the
arena]{.underline}**---**in which to theorize while encouraging a
historical sensitivity---to [regimes of discourse and suggests an
ethico-politics of freedom from the impo­sitions of
identity]{.underline}**.** Although Foucault\'s conception of the
problematic points to how concepts and the modes of fact assigned to
them are historically contin­gent, explicable in contexts of value, and
complicit with modes of power and authority**,** [this does
not]{.underline} thereby [invalidate theory]{.underline}**. Rather,**
[it opens the way to work on the ethico-political context of theory and,
among other things, to theo­rize with a sensitivity to theory\'s
constituencies (beyond the policymakers that seem to be prized by
Jarvis).]{.underline} **As Molly Cochran, whose work is based on
knowl­edge and critique rather than rumor and contempt, implies,** [[an
important legacy of contemporary critical work is the expansion of
political and moral inclusion.]{.mark}]{.underline} Finally, there is
one other genre that is (regrettably) embedded in Jarvis\'s fable of the
dangers of postmodernism, a biographical speculation about a five-year
hiatus in Richard Ashley\'s publishing life. Obsessed with the dangers
of postmodernism, Jarvis attributes these years of silence to the \"deep
resigna­tion\" (p. 183) that he thinks Ashley\'s version of postmodern
theorizing invites. Without insisting on a counterspeculation, I want to
point out that Ashley\'s publishing hiatus coincides with the period
shortly after an automobile accident claimed the life of his wife and
seriously maimed his two sons**.** [At a minimum, [the
infor]{.mark}mation [renders Jarvis\'s biographical fable crass and
uninformed---like the rest of the book.]{.mark}]{.underline}

equal right and opportunity, regardless of gender, to exploit and
plunder marginalized, "othered" communities, whether one finds or

[[The capitalist system]{.mark}'s propensity to reorganise the economy
on a global scale to its own profit [has direct repercussions on gender
relations]{.mark}]{.underline}. Analysis of its methods shows that, on
the one hand, [[the capitalist system]{.mark} feeds on a pre-existing
system of oppression -- [patriarchy]{.mark} -- and on the other, [it
compounds many of its defining characteristics]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
The [oppression of women is a tool which enables capitalists to manage
the entire workforce to their own profit]{.underline}]{.mark}. [It also
enables them to justify their policies when they find it more profitable
to shift the responsibility for social welfare from the State and
collective institutions to the "privacy" of the family]{.underline}. In
other words, [[when the capitalists need extra labour, they call upon
women whom they pay less than men]{.mark}, which has the side-effect of
dragging down wages generally]{.underline}. This means that the State is
forced to provide services to facilitate women's jobs or allow them to
offload some of their responsibilities. Then [[when they no longer
require women's labour, they send them home, back to their "proper
place" in patriarchal terms]{.mark}.]{.underline} There is not yet a
country in the world, even among the most advanced in this area, where
women's pay is equal to men's. Indeed some [industrialized countries are
seriously losing ground in comparative terms of human
development]{.underline}, regarding this criterion: Canada has slipped
back from the 1st to the 9th place in world ranking, Luxemburg has
fallen back twelve places, the Netherlands sixteen and Spain twenty-six
(UNDP, 1995). Careers where women are in the majority in fields such as
health care and education are devalued. [[When capitalism is in crisis,
austerity measures are introduced whereby women are the first to be
excluded from social benefits]{.underline}]{.mark} such as unemployment
benefits, for example, where they exist. Elsewhere, [they are pushed
into very poorly-paid jobs such as work in the free zones. In Mexico in
this sector women's salaries have collapsed from 80% to a mere 57% of
men's.]{.underline} They may also be won over by the idea of doing a
good job for a pittance among the multitude of jobs in the informal
sector, beyond the pale of "paralysing " State regulations.

[The [relationship between globalization and militarism should be seen
as two sides of the same coin]{.underline}]{.mark}. On one side,
[[globalization promotes the conditions that lead to]{.mark} unrest,
inequality[, conflict, and]{.mark}, ultimately,
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the other side, [[globalization fuels the
means to wage war]{.mark} by protecting and promoting the military
industries needed to produce sophisticated weaponry]{.underline}. This
[[weaponry]{.mark},]{.underline} in turn, [[is used]{.underline}]{.mark}
or is threatened to be used [[to protect the investments of
transnational corporations]{.underline}]{.mark} and their shareholders.
As several contributors note, [colonial expansionism and the quest for
control of strategic locations historically have been a major
justification and impetus for military intervention]{.underline}.
[Control over scarce resources is an essential element in many
contemporary conflicts]{.underline}. The [Persian Gulf War was about
oil]{.underline}, as the U.S. catchphrase, \"our oil is under their
soil,\" made clear. Michael Renner\'s list of [international water
disputes provides examples on every continent]{.underline} (Table 1).
These disputes are of varying intensity and have not led to armed
conflict in most cases, but the potential is there. Fighting between
India and Pakistan over Kashmir, for example, which has been going on
for over 50 years, concerns control of this watershed region. Water
allocation, water diversion, and water rights are also key elements of
tension in the Middle East. In the third article, Ian Smillie discusses
[the role of the lucrative diamond industry in war-torn Sierra Leone,
noting that \"diamonds - small pieces of carbon with no great intrinsic
value -have been the cause of widespread death, destruction, and misery
for almost a decade]{.underline}.\" He argues that [the point of this
war \"may not actually have been to win it, but to engage in profitable
crime under the cover of warfare.\"]{.underline} Although U.N. Security
Council Resolution 1306 bans trading in diamonds from areas held by the
Sierra Leone Revolutionary United Front (RUF), the RUF has financed its
military activities since 1991 by selling diamonds for arms. Pressure on
traders and consumers to avoid purchasing \"conflict diamonds\" has led
to recent efforts to reorganize the diamond trade somewhat. Since the
1950s, Smillie notes, the government of Sierra Leone has made no
pretence of being able to provide security for mining companies, and has
required them to provide their own security. Talbot comments on the role
of privately held Military Protection Resource Inc. in former
Yugoslavia. Lochbihler (1999: 19) makes a more general point, noting
\"an increase in the dissolution of state structures, which also means
an erosion of the monopoly of violence by the state.\" [This has given
rise to a \"new security industry\" comprised of paid military experts
and mercenaries who are \"of service to whomever can pay]{.underline}."

Although [economic restructuring is an essential factor

in]{.underline} much mainstream [representation of]{.underline} violence

strife masks economic factors, the importance of class inequalities, and
the role of military intervention and harsh police measures in
neoliberal economics]{.underline}]{.mark}. Such explanations may be
particularly effective in the United States, where the dominant national
discourse highlights racial and ethnic divisions and downplays the
significance of class as an economic category. [[Because people are very
poorly informed]{.underline}]{.mark}, because [[there is no familiar
economic explanation for intranational conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} or

assumption that the \"most effectual\" means of promoting the public
interest of society is to just ignore it and concentrate instead on the
pursuit of economic self-interest. In the 18th century, this
narcissistic economic philosophy had little impact on the natural world.
Today it has a huge impact and is, moreover, totally at odds with the
world\'s scientific bodies who are crying out for a PLAN to stop global
warming and save nature. Capitalist Limits to Corporate
Environmentalist!! Corporations aren\'t necessarily evil, but corporate
managers are legally responsible to their owners, the shareholders, and
not to society. This means that the [[critical]{.mark} [decisions about
production]{.mark} and resource consumption]{.underline}-decisions
[[that affect]{.mark} our]{.underline} health and
[[survival]{.mark}-[are]{.mark} mainly [the]{.mark} private [prerogative
of]{.mark} large [corporations]{.mark}]{.underline} and are often only
marginally under the control of governments. The blunt reality of this
situation was well summed up by Joel Bakan in his recent book (and
film), The Corporation: Corporations are created by law and imbued with
purpose by law. Law dictates what their directors and managers can do,
what they cannot do, and what they must do. And, at least in the United
States and other industrialized countries, the corporation, as created
by law, most closely resembles Milton Friedman\'s ideal model of the
institution: it compels executives to prioritize the interests of their
companies and shareholders above all others and forbids them from being
socially responsible - at least genuinely so.38 So [[when corporate and
societal interests conflict]{.mark}, [even the \"greenest]{.mark}\" of
corporate [CEO]{.mark}s]{.underline} often [have no choice but to [make
decisions]{.mark} [contrary to the interests of
society]{.mark}]{.underline}. British Petroleum\'s CEO, Lord John
Browne, is good example. In the late 1990s, Browne had an environmental
epiphany, broke ranks with oil industry denial, and became the first oil
company executive to warn that fossil fuels are accelerating global
warming. BP adopted the motto \"Beyond Petroleum\" in its
advertisements, painted its service stations green and yellow, and
bought a boutique solar power outfit. But under Browne, BP has spent far
more on advertising its green credentials than it invests in actual
green power production. Fully 99 percent of its investments still go
into fossil fuel exploration and development, while solar power is less
than 1 percent and seems to be declining. 9 In 1999, BP spent \$45
million to buy the solar power outfit Solarex. By comparison, BP paid
\$26.8 billion to buy Amoco in order to enlarge its oil portfolio. BP\'s
2004 revenues topped \$285 billion, while its solar power sales were
just over \$400 million. In February 2006, Browne told his board that
the company had more than replenished its marketed output in 2005 with
new proven reserves of oil and gas, and that \"with more than 20 new
projects due on stream in the next three years, and assuming the same
level of oil price, the annual rate of increase should continue at some
4 percent through 2010.\"40 So, far from shifting to renewable sources
of energy, BP is not only expanding its output of fossil fuels but
increasing its overall reliance on fossil fuel sources of profit. BP now
possesses proven reserves of 19 billion barrels produced in 23
countries, and the company currently explores for oil in 26 countries.
Given the proven and stupendous profits of oil production versus the
unproven profitability of alternative energy, how can Brown go \"green\"
in any serious way and remain responsible to his owner-investors?41 Were
he to do so, he would soon be out of a job.42 Ecosocialism or Collapse
[If we\'re going to stop the capitalist economic locomotive from driving
us off the cliff]{.underline}, [we]{.underline} are going to [have to
fundamentally rethink our entire economic life]{.underline}, reassert
the visible hand of conscious scientific, rational economic planning,
and implement democratic control over our economies and resources.
[[We\'re going to have to construct]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n entirely
[different]{.mark} kind of [economy]{.mark}]{.underline}, one that can
live within its ecological means. Such an economy would have to be based
around at least the following principles: An Ecosocialist Economy of
Stasis First, in a world of fast-diminishing resources, a sustainable
global economy can only be based on near-zero economic growth on
average. That means that [[to survive]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[humanity
will have to impose]{.mark} drastic [fixed limits on
development]{.mark}, resource consumption, the freedom to
consume]{.underline}, [and the freedom to pollute]{.underline}. Given
existing global inequities and the fact that the crisis we face is
overwhelmingly caused by overconsumption in the industrialized North,
equity can only be achieved by imposing massive cutbacks in the advanced
countries combined with a program of rational planned growth to develop
the Third World, with the aim of stabilizing at zero growth on average.
This will require drastically cutting back many lines of production,
closing down others entirely, and creating socially and environmentally
useful jobs for workers made redundant by this transition. This will
also require physical rationing of many critical resources on a per
capita basis for every person on the planet. [[Human
survival]{.underline} [will]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[require a
profound rethinking of]{.mark} our most fundamental
ideas]{.underline}-bourgeois ideas-[of [economic
freedom]{.mark}]{.underline}. For too long, many Americans, in
particular, have come to identify their notion of \"freedom,\" if not
their very being and essence, with insatiable consumption-unlimited
freedom of \"choice\" in what to buy. But 50 styles of blue jeans, 16
models of SUVs and endless choices in \"consumer electronics\" will all
have dramatically less value when Bloomingdales is under water, Florida
disappears beneath the waves, malarial mosquitos blanket Long Island
beaches, and the U.S. is overrun with desperate environmental refugees
from the South. Once we as a society finally admit the \"inconvenient
truth\" that we have no choice but to drastically cut production and
severely reduce consumer choice, it will also become apparent that we
have to put in place a planned economy that will meet our needs and
those of future generations as well as the other species with whom we
share the planet. A Restructured Economy of Production for Social Need
and for Use Second, we need to massively restructure the global economy.
Enormous sectors in the global capitalist economy-plastics, packaging,
much of the manufactured consumer electronics, petrochemical-based and
other synthetic products, many pharmaceuticals, all genetically modified
foods, and the vast and ever-growing production of arms-are either
completely unnecessary or waste increasingly scarce resources and
produce needless pollution.44 Our parents did without nearly all of this
before WWII, and they were not living in caves. Many lines of production
and most retail industries are built around unnecessary replacement and
designed-in obsolescence. How much of the American economy from cars and
appliances to clothes is purposefully designed to be \"consumed, burned
up, worn out, replaced, and discarded at an ever-increasing rate\"46 so
the cycle of waste production can begin all over again? How much of the
planet\'s natural resources are consumed every year in completely
unnecessary annual model changes, fashion updates, and \"new and
improved\" products whose only purpose is simply to sell and sell again?
If a global population of 6 to 9 billion people is going to survive this
century, what choice do we have but to reorganize the global economy to
conserve what shrinking natural resources we have left, reorient
production for need rather than profit, design products to last as long
as possible, enforce as close to total recycling as possible, and aim
for as close to zero pollution as is possible? A Socialist Economic
Democracy Third: an ecosocialist democracy. Endless growth or stasis?
Resource exhaustion or conservation? Automobilization of the planet or
enhanced public transport? Deforestation or protection of the wild
forests? Agro poisons or organic farming? Hunt the fish to extinction or
protect the fisheries? Raze the Amazon forest to grow MacBurgers or
promote a more vegetarian diet? Manufacture products designed to be
\"used up, burned up, consumed as rapidly as possible\" or design them
to last, be repaired, recycled and also shared? Enforce private
interests at the expense of the commons or subordinate private greed to
the common good? In today\'s globalized world, decisions about such
questions will determine the fate of humanity. [Who can
make]{.underline} these [critical]{.underline} economic and moral
[decisions in society\'s interest and in the interest of preserving a
habitable planet?]{.underline} [[In]{.underline}]{.mark} Adam Smith\'s
view, which is still [the operable maxim of modern [capitalist]{.mark}s
and neoliberal [economists]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [we
should]{.underline} [all just \"Look out for Number
1]{.underline},\"]{.mark} and the common good will take care of itself.
[[If Smith were right, the common good would have taken care of
itself]{.underline}]{.mark} long ago, [[and we wouldn\'t be facing
catastrophe]{.underline}.]{.mark} After centuries of Smithian economics,
the common good needs our immediate and concentrated attention.
[[Corporations can\'t make]{.mark} such [decisions]{.mark} [in
the]{.mark} best [interests of society or the
future]{.mark}]{.underline}, because their legal responsibility is to
their private owners. [[The only way such decisions can be]{.mark}
scientifically rational and socially [responsible is when
everyone]{.mark} who is affected [participates in
decision-making]{.mark}]{.underline}. And time is running out. We don\'t
have 20 or 30 years to wait for Ford and GM to figure out how they can
make a buck on electric cars. We don\'t have 60 or 70 years to wait
while investors in coal-powered power plants milk the last profits out
of those sunk investments before they consider an alternative.
[[Humanity is at a crossroads]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Either we
find]{.underline} a way to [move toward a global economic democracy in
which decisions about production and consumption are directly and
democratically decided]{.underline} by all those affected, [or the
alternative will be the]{.underline} [continuing descent into a
capitalist war of all-against-all]{.underline} [over ever-diminishing
resources that can]{.underline} [only end in the collapse of what\'s
left of civilization and the global ecology]{.underline}. To be sure, in
an economic democracy, society would sometimes make mistakes in
planning. We can\'t have perfect foresight, and democracies make
mistakes. But at least these would be honest mistakes. The conclusion
seems inescapable: [[Either we democratize the
economy]{.underline}]{.mark}, construct the institutions of a practical
working socialist democracy, [[or we face ecological and social
collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}.

**[The final stage of a mortal combat between man]{.underline}**kind
**[and capitalism is in progress]{.underline}**. A specificity of
**[[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** is that, in contrast to
\"classical\" barbarism (which is of destructive, murderous and
plundering nature), it [**[annihilates life by creating a \"new
world]{.underline}**\"]{.mark} -- a \"technical civilization\" and an
adequate, dehumanized and denaturalized man. Capitalism has eradicated
man from his (natural) environment and has cut off the roots through
which he had drawn life-creating force. Cities are \"gardens\" of
capitalism where degenerated creatures \"grow\". Dog excrement, gasoline
and sewerage stench, glaring advertisements and police car rotating
lights that howl through the night - this is the environment of the
\"free world\" man. **[[By destroying the]{.mark} natural [environment
capitalism creates]{.mark} [increasingly extreme climatic
conditions]{.mark} in which man is struggling harder and harder to
survive -- [and]{.mark} creates [artificial living conditions accessible
solely to the richest layer of population, which cause definitive
degeneration of man as a natural being]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
\"Humanization of life\" is being limited to creation of micro-climatic
conditions, of special capitalistic incubators - completely
commercialized artificial living conditions to which degenerated people
are appropriate. The most dramatic truth is: capitalism can survive the
death of man as a human and biological being. **[For capitalism a
\"traditional man\" is merely a temporary means of its own reproduction.
\"[Consumer-man\" represents a transitional phase in the
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**-caused process of mutation of man
**[[towards the \"highest\" form of capitalistic man: a
robot-man]{.underline}]{.mark}**. \"Terminators\" and other robotized
freaks which are products of the Hollywood entertainment industry which
creates a \"vision of the future\" degenerated in a capitalist manner,
incarnate creative powers, [**[alienated from]{.underline}**]{.mark}
man, which become vehicles for destruction of man and life. A new
\"super race\" of robotized humanoids is being created, which should
clash with \"traditional mankind\", meaning with people capable of
**[[loving]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[thinking]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[daydreaming, fighting for [freedom and survival
]{.mark}]{.underline}**- and impose their rule over the Earth. Instead
of the new world, the \"new man\" is being created - who has been
reduced to a level of humanity which cannot jeopardize the ruling order.
Science and technique have become the basic lever of capital for the
destruction of the world and the creation of \"technical civilization\".
It is not only about destruction achieved by the use of technical means.
It is about technicization of social institutions, of interpersonal
relations, of the human body. Increasing
**[transformation]{.underline}** of nature **[into a surrogate of
\"nature]{.underline}**\", increasing dehumanization of the society and
increasing denaturalization of man **[are]{.underline}** direct
consequences of **[capital\'s effort]{.underline}**, within an
increasingly merciless global economic war, **[to achieve complete
commercialization of both natural and the social
environment]{.underline}**. The optimism of the Enlightenment could
hardly be unreservedly supported nowadays, the notion of Marx that man
imposes on himself only such tasks as he can solve, particularly the
optimism based on the myth of the \"omnipotence\" of science and
technique. The race for profits has already caused irreparable and still
unpredictable damage to both man and his environment. By the creation of
\"consumer society\", which means through the transition of capitalism
into a phase of pure destruction, [[**such a qualitative rise in
destruction of nature and mankind has been performed that** life on the
planet is literally facing a \"countdown\".]{.underline}]{.mark} Instead
of the \"withering away\" (Engels) of institutions of the capitalist
society, the withering away of life is taking place. \[sic\]

#### The war against nature is invisible but its real---it turns the AFFs war impacts and culminates in extinction 

Tamás **Szentes 8**, Professor Emeritus at the Corvinus University of
Budapest. "Globalisation and prospects of the world society" 4/22/08
http://www.eadi.org/fileadmin/Documents/Events/exco/Glob.\_\_\_prospects\_-\_jav..pdf

It' s a common place that human society can survive and develop only in
a lasting real peace. Without peace countries cannot develop. Although
since 1945 there has been no world war, but \--numerous local wars took
place, \--terrorism has spread all over the world, undermining security
even in the most developed and powerful countries, \--arms race and
militarisation have not ended with the collapse of the Soviet bloc, but
escalated and continued, extending also to weapons of mass destruction
and misusing enormous resources badly needed for development,
\--**[[many "invisible wars" are suffered by the
poor]{.underline}]{.mark}** and oppressed people, **[[manifested in mass
misery, poverty]{.mark}, unemployment, homelessness,
[starvation]{.mark}]{.underline}** and malnutrition, epidemics and poor
health conditions, [**[exploitation and
oppression]{.underline}**,]{.mark} racial and other discrimination,
physical terror, organised injustice, disguised forms of violence, the
denial or regular infringement of the democratic rights of citizens,
women, youth, ethnic or religious minorities, etc.,
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** last but not least, **[in the
[degradation of human environment]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which means
that \--**[[the "war against Nature]{.underline}]{.mark}**", i.e. the
disturbance of ecological balance, wasteful management of natural
resources, [[and large-scale pollution of our
environment]{.underline}]{.mark}, is still going on, causing also losses
and fatal dangers for human life. **[[Behind]{.mark}]{.underline}**
global terrorism and **[["invisible wars" we find striking international
and intrasoci ety inequities]{.mark} and distorted development
patterns]{.underline}** , **[[which]{.mark} tend to [generate social as
well as international tensions]{.mark}]{.underline}**, thus **[[paving
the way for]{.mark} unrest and ["visible" wars]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
It is a commonplace now that peace is not merely the absence of war. The
prerequisites of a lasting peace between and within societies involve
not only - though, of course, necessarily - demilitarisation, but also a
systematic and gradual elimination of the roots of violence, of the
causes of "invisible wars", of the structural and institutional bases of
large-scale international and intra-society inequalities, exploitation
and oppression. Peace requires a process of social and national
emancipation, a progressive, democratic transformation of societies and
the world bringing about equal rights and opportunities for all people,
sovereign participation and mutually advantageous co-operation among
nations. It further requires a pluralistic democracy on global level
with an appropriate system of proportional representation of the world
society, articulation of diverse interests and their peaceful
reconciliation, by non-violent conflict management, and thus also a
global governance with a really global institutional system. Under the
contemporary conditions of accelerating globalisation and deepening
global interdependencies in our world, **[[peace]{.mark}]{.underline}**
is indivisible in both time and space. It cannot exist if reduced to a
period only after or before war, and **[[cannot be safeguarded]{.mark}
in one part of the world [when some]{.mark} others [suffer]{.mark}
visible or [invisible wars]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Thus, peace requires,
indeed, a new, demilitarised and democratic world order, which can
provide equal opportunities for sustainable development. "Sustainability
of development" (both on national and world level) is often interpreted
as an issue of environmental protection only and reduced to the need for
preserving the ecological balance and delivering the next generations
not a destroyed Nature with overexhausted resources and polluted
environment. However, **[[no ecological balance can be ensured,
unless]{.mark} the deep international development gap and [intra-society
inequalities are substantially reduced]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}
Owing to global interdependencies there may exist hardly any
"zero-sum-games", in which one can gain at the expense of others, but,
instead, the "negative-sum-games" tend to predominate, in which
everybody must suffer, later or sooner, directly or indirectly, losses.
Therefore, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} actual [[question is not about
"sustainability of development" but]{.underline}]{.mark} rather
**[[about the "sustainability of human life",]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[i.e. survival of mankind]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- because of
ecological imbalance and globalised terrorism. When Professor Louk de la
Rive Box was the president of EADI, one day we had an exchange of views
on the state and future of development studies. We agreed that
development studies are not any more restricted to the case of
underdeveloped countries, as the developed ones (as well as the former
"socialist" countries) are also facing development problems, such as
those of structural and institutional (and even system-) transformation,
requirements of changes in development patterns, and concerns about
natural environment. While all these are true, today I would dare say
that besides (or even instead of) "development studies" we must speak
about and make "survival studies". While the monetary, financial, and
debt crises are cyclical, we live in an almost permanent crisis of the
world society, which is multidimensional in nature, involving not only
economic but also socio-psychological, behavioural, cultural and
political aspects. **[The narrow-minded, election-oriented, [selfish
behaviour motivated by thirst for]{.mark} power and
[wealth]{.mark},]{.underline}** which still characterise the political
leadership almost all over the world, **[[paves the way for the final,
last catastrophe]{.underline}]{.mark}**. One cannot doubt, of course,
that great many positive historical changes have also taken place in the
world in the last century. Such as decolonisation, transformation of
socio-economic systems, democratisation of political life in some former
fascist or authoritarian states, institutionalisation of welfare
policies in several countries, rise of international organisations and
new forums for negotiations, conflict management and cooperation,
institutionalisation of international assistance programmes by
multilateral agencies, codification of human rights, and rights of
sovereignty and democracy also on international level, collapse of the
militarised Soviet bloc and system-change3 in the countries concerned,
the end of cold war, etc., to mention only a few. Nevertheless, the
crisis of the world society has extended and deepened, approaching to a
point of bifurcation that necessarily puts an end to the present
tendencies, either by the final catastrophe or a common solution.
**[Under the circumstances provided by rapidly progressing science and
technological revolutions, [human society cannot survive unless]{.mark}
such profound [intra-society and international inequalities]{.mark}
prevailing today [are]{.mark} soon [eliminated]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Like a single spacecraft, the **[[Earth can no longer afford to
have]{.underline}]{.mark}** a \'crew\' divided into [[two parts: the
rich, privileged]{.underline}]{.mark}, wellfed, well-educated, [[on the
one hand, and the poor, deprived]{.underline}]{.mark}, starving, sick
and uneducated, [[on the other]{.underline}]{.mark}. Dangerous
\'zero-sum-games\' (which mostly prove to be "negative-sum-games") can
hardly be played any more by visible or invisible wars in the world
society. Because of global interdependencies, the apparent winner
becomes also a loser. The real choice for the world society is between
negative- and positive-sum-games: i.e. between, on the one hand,
continuation of visible and "invisible wars", as long as this is
possible at all, and, on the other, transformation of the world order by
demilitarisation and democratization. No ideological or terminological
camouflage can conceal this real dilemma any more, which is to be faced
not in the distant future, by the next generations, but in the coming
years, because of global terrorism soon having nuclear and other mass
destructive weapons, and also due to irreversible changes in natural
environment.

However **[[the tech]{.mark}nology [to build isolated]{.mark}
extraterrestrial [settlements]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}naturally
**[[brings along]{.mark} with it another potentially [powerful
tech]{.mark}nology--[the ability to move sizeable
asteroids]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Back **[in]{.underline}**
19**[79]{.underline}** **[it was shown that this is not as difficult as
one might at first think]{.underline}**. The requisite technique is to
land a spacecraft on one asteroid, dig up material and throw it the path
of another asteroid that will approach nearby, and perturb the orbit of
that asteroid until it passes nearby another large object. Once an
asteroid or comet makes a controlled approach near any planet but
Mercury or Pluto, then it can easily be directed near or at the earth at
enormous velocity. Fortunately for our hypothetical descendants here
destroying all human life on earth by asteroid impact would likely
require moving objects with a diameter in excess of ten kilometers.
While there are many of these, the required orbit perturbation would
require a lot of lead-time and work and could be very difficult to
motivate and conceal. Nevertheless **[[with contributions from
this]{.mark} technology [a dispute between the earth and a handful of
its fragile far-flung offspring in space that is carried to the extreme
could]{.mark} conceivably [lead to]{.mark} human
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Only when settlements in space are
sufficiently numerous or far flung would such a possibility effectively
be ruled out, primarily by physical considerations.

The arguments against terraforming other planets are based on moral
objections[: **is it morally right to cause such drastic changes to
another planet?**]{.underline} Mars might contain as yet undiscovered
forms of microscopic life that have evolved under Martian conditions,
and consequently our presence will jeopardize these by bringing our
micro-organisms which may attack and kill the Martian ones. This
objection would be stronger if there was evidence of Martian life-forms,
as a major climatic change could also upset their development. 2
**[There is also an objection that [human efforts to transform Earth
have resulted in a catalogue of]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}man-made
**[[disasters and unforeseen catastrophes]{.mark}. [How much worse would
it be if we started in an environment of which we know less than we do
of Earth]{.mark}? [Something might go wrong, leaving things even worse
off with regard to the planet\'s ability to foster
life.]{.mark}]{.underline}** There might even be repercussions on Earth.
3 The fact that terraforming is a long-term project would act as a
disincentive to governments with regard to investment. Moreover,
[**[scarce human talent and resources would be diverted from worthy
projects]{.mark} on Earth, such as social and environmental problems. .
4 If terraforming and hence colonization are successful, they would not
divert resources away from warfare: on the contrary, [wars would]{.mark}
very likely [be fought over the new territory; and military uses of the

**Space exploration causes space diseases, wiping out life on earth**

**Mullen '03** \[Leslie, 8-25-2003, "Alien Infection," Astrobiology
Magazine,
http://www.astrobio.net/news/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=570\]

Chris Chyba, who holds the Carl Sagan Chair for the Study of Life in the
Universe at the SETI Institute, says **[there are two types of potential
alien pathogens: toxic and infectious]{.underline}**. Toxic pathogens
act as a poison on other organisms. Infectious pathogens are viruses or
bacteria that are passed between organisms, causing sickness. Some
viruses and microbes rely on specific biological systems in order to
replicate and infect their host, so not all pathogens affect all
organisms the same way. Chicken farmers, for instance, can remain
untouched by a disease that decimates their flocks. It could be that a
martian microbe would enter the human body, but is rendered harmless
because it is incompatible with human physiology. \"**[[After living in
the dirt of Mars, a pathogen could see our bodies as a comparable
host]{.underline}]{.mark}**; they could treat us \'like dirt,\'\" says
John Rummel, NASA\'s Planetary Protection Officer. \"But, to quote
Donald Rumsfeld, we\'re dealing with the unknown unknowns. It could be
that even if the microbes lived inside us, they wouldn\'t do anything,
it would just be this lump living inside you.\" The conditions on Mars
are much different than those in the human body, so an inert pathogen
seems the most likely scenario \-- especially since any life on Mars
would have evolved without humans being present. Co-evolution is why
some pathogens only affect certain organisms. Infectious pathogens
evolve based on the reactions of their hosts. As the host develops
defenses against a predatory pathogen, the pathogen has to devise new
means of sustaining itself within the host (or risk its own extinction).
Some toxins also developed through co-evolution. As predatory organisms
seek food, their prey develop ever more sophisticated means to escape
being eaten. Many organisms developed specially targeted toxins as part
of this evolutionary arms battle. Rummel says that humans have evolved a
complex defense system to prevent us from getting sick from a whole host
of disease and pathogens. But non-specific microbes - where human
physiology did not influence their evolution - may evade our defense
mechanisms. The best way to understand the spread of potential alien
pathogens is to examine the spread of such non-specific pathogens on
Earth. One example of a non-specific toxic pathogen is cyanobacteria
that produce hepatotoxins (toxins affecting the liver) and neurotoxins.
According to Chyba, cyanobacteria living in lakes on the alpine pastures
of Switzerland have been implicated in a hundred cattle poisonings over
the past 25 years. Chyba says the cyanobacteria most likely did not
develop their toxins in order to escape predation from cows (or to kill
the cows in order to eat them!). \"Rather, the susceptibility of cattle
to these toxins seems simply to be an unfortunate coincidence of a toxin
working across a large evolutionary distance,\" Chyba writes. An example
of an infectious pathogen working across large evolutionary distances is
the bacterium Serratia marcescens. It is found in a variety of animal
species, and also can be found free-living in water and soil. Its
transmission from human sewage has resulted in the decimation of
Caribbean elkhorn coral. \"The distance between humans and corals
emphasizes the possibility that certain **[[organisms may prove
pathogenic across a wide evolutionary divide]{.mark},]{.underline}**\"
Chyba writes. Of course, the evolutionary divide between humans and
coral would not be as wide a gulf as between any martian organisms and
human beings. Yet one theory for the origin of life on Earth is that it
was transferred here from Mars by meteorites. This variant of the
\"Panspermia\" theory suggests that life on Earth and any life on Mars
might be closely related. If Mars and Earth share the basis for life,
this life would presumably have evolved well beyond the original form.
Such a large evolutionary divide could provide protection from
infection. But it could also mean that **[[if infection does occur, it
might be related closely enough to some Earth life to blaze through that
population unchecked]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Human infection is not the
only concern of planetary protection. Life on Earth forms an
interconnected, highly dependent web, so **[[a pathogen affecting any
life on Earth could have serious repercussions for the]{.mark} health
and environment of our [planet]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**Space doesn't prevent extinction -- space only embraces a regressive
mindset that stops reforms to prevent extinction level events**

**Jozef '01** \[Jozef Hand-Boniakowski, Ph.D, "THE STATE OF HUMANITY",

**[Human optimism is tempered by minds such as Stephen Hawking\'s who
states]{.underline}**, \"I am afraid the atmosphere might get hotter and
hotter until it will be like Venus with boiling sulfuric acid\...I am
worried about the greenhouse effect.\" Hawking\'s projection
optimistically foresees the extinction of humanity within a millennium.
I give it much less time than that. As a solution, Hawking suggests
human transplantation into space where \"**[at least it would ensure
that people don\'t become extinct.\" [Hawking does not offer how to
prevent extinction, rather how to circumvent]{.mark} or cheat
[it]{.mark}. In my mind, [this is analogous to the regressive mindset
that ignores the pursuit of difficult solutions in favor of quick,
short-sighted and often self-fulfilling prophetic courses of
action]{.mark}. [No need]{.mark}, for example, [to eliminate the causes
of war when bigger wars]{.mark} and bigger weapons of war (as the
thinking goes) [can lead to victory]{.mark} in those wars. No need to
resolve the issues that lead to the terror of September 11, when
reciprocal and bigger terror (under any name but) can be used in

[of]{.mark}]{.underline} precarity and livelihoods, of [[environmental
degradation, climate]{.mark} [change and]{.mark}]{.underline} of
[[social justice]{.mark}, [all point to a]{.mark} global [context that
would]{.mark}]{.underline} [[require]{.mark} a radical
[reconfiguration]{.mark} [of social relations]{.mark}]{.underline}, a
new world, [new social systems [articulating our production in
common]{.mark}]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} [how and
whether]{.underline} [these crises will be an opportunity to embark
on]{.underline} this journey of [transformation of social
reproduction]{.underline} [is not]{.underline} clear nor is it
[given]{.underline}. [While [social contestations are gaining
momentum]{.mark}]{.underline} in a variety of theatres and contexts, it
is clear that [[neoliberal capital seems adamant]{.underline}]{.mark}
[that it [can]{.mark}]{.underline} [[push through]{.mark} a [new]{.mark}
phase of [global governance]{.mark}]{.underline} [[without
questioning]{.mark} the [basic structures]{.mark} and policies that have
precipitated the financial crisis in 2008]{.underline} [with
the]{.underline} consequent [intensification of all other
crises]{.underline}. Indeed, not only the remaining bundle of social
entitlements and rights are under threat under intensifying austerity
policies around the world. There are also clear signs that the
multimillion dollar operation that rescued banks in 2008 is now being
institutionalised into the DNA of modern neoliberal capital governance.
In Europe, for example, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) is being
set up as a permanent rescue-funding programme to succeed the temporary
ad hoc mechanisms set up in the rescue operation of the financial
system. Not only 'the granting of any required financial assistance
under the mechanism will be made subject to strict conditionality'
(European Council 2012). Also, upon joining the mechanism, the countries
involved will be obliged to contribute funding to the rescue package.
Neoliberalism has never been about the withdrawal of the state from
welfare, but the shift in the modality of welfare from the poor to the
rich. In the first part of the neoliberal period, from the late 1970s,
this amounted to slash in social services, privatisation, cut in higher
tax rates and subsidies to exporters and incentives to foreign
investors. In the middle part from the mid 1990s it was all about
finding ways to govern the wasteland created and the conflict generated
therein. After the attempt to incite the masses to work for the country
in the war on terror period (from 2001), in this last fourth phase after
the crisis of 2008, capital demands that public money is functionally
funneled into the rescue of banks and the maintenance of the
disciplinary function of finance without which modern capitalism could
not operate. [In the]{.underline} early [1980s we were told to look up
at the world of finance for inspiration on how 'betterment' for all
could be achieved with rigor and entrepreneurial risk
taking]{.underline}. [In the]{.underline} early [2010s [we are told
to]{.mark}]{.underline} [[pay]{.mark} with rigor [t]{.mark}he austerity
necessary to compensate the failed risk taking of the 1%,]{.underline}
[[otherwise the]{.mark} entire paper [castle would fall]{.mark}, with us
inside]{.underline}. And [[we are told to accept this]{.mark} is
the]{.underline} [de-facto [norm of]{.mark} our systemic
[interaction]{.mark} with one another]{.underline}. [Yet]{.underline},
in spite of waiving the safety net for the financial system, [[capital
seems to be at an impossible crossroad]{.underline}]{.mark}. On one
hand, [it needs nonfinancial growth to buffer, accommodate and decompose
struggles]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}, at the same time, to [fulfill
its drive for accumulation and allow some debt to be
repaid]{.underline}. [On the other hand,]{.underline} however, today
more than ever, [[growth can only exacerbate]{.mark} [the
contradictions]{.mark} at the basis of these struggles,]{.underline} if
only [because [there cannot be]{.mark} any [overall growth
with]{.mark}]{.underline} [simultaneous [reduction in]{.mark} greenhouse
[emissions]{.mark}, nor]{.underline} [[without]{.mark} an
[intensification of]{.mark} existing [inequalities]{.mark}]{.underline}
also caused by the operations of current financial systems that
governments are so eager to rescue. This crossroad is not avoided if
instead of a future scenario of growth we postulate one of stagnation or
de-growth. If on one hand this scenario would somehow mitigate the
pressures on climate change, [in so far [as capitalist relations
remain]{.mark} [dominant]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in a]{.mark}rticulating
and valuing [social co-operation, it would]{.mark} do so with heavy
social costs and at a likely [intensifi]{.mark}cation of]{.underline}
precarity, social injustice and [[social conflic]{.mark}t]{.underline}
against these. In both scenarios, and given the historical experiences
in other crises and looking at current dynamics, we can postulate the
development of four phenomena. First, the growth of struggles of
different sectors within the global society throwing a spanner in the
wheel and resisting the reduction in rights and entitlements necessary
for further neoliberal governance of the crisis, against debt and
demanding some form of re-distributive justice to the state. This is
what we will refer to as social movements. Second, the growth of
collective self-help solutions to the problems of social reproduction
faced by communities. This corresponds to what we call the development
of the commons. Third, the development and refinement of capital's
commons cooptation strategies, or what I have elsewhere (De Angelis
2012) called commons fix. Fourth, the development and refinement of
strategies of repression of struggles and enclosures of commons. In this
paper I will not discuss in detail these four postulated developments,
but problematise the interrelation among the first three for the purpose
of contributing to the debate over the establishment of alternatives to
capitalism. Indeed, [what underpins this analysis is an attempt
to]{.underline} answer, or at least [develop a framework with which to
start to answer an important naïve question]{.underline}. [[The role of
naïve questions]{.underline},]{.mark} Socrates taught us, [[is
to]{.mark} [problematise the systems of knowledge]{.mark} at the basis
of our certainties]{.underline}, [of our mental schemes [through which
we give meaning to the world]{.mark} around us [and]{.mark} thus
[intervene in it]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In this paper I want to
address very big and naïve questions, in fact, meta-questions at the
basis of what we may call a critical theory of the commons. [[How can
social movements]{.mark} and struggles [change the
world]{.mark}?]{.underline} And how can they do it [in the direction of
a far better place for all]{.underline} (or at least the '99%'), [more
convivial and cohesive, socially economically and environmentally just,
where dignity, peace]{.underline}, freedom, autonomy, solidarity,
conviviality, [equality are]{.underline} not so much articles of faith,
but [guiding values of an orienting compass of ongoing social
transformation?]{.underline} I do not intend nor aspire to provide a
firm answer, as this can really be generated through praxis. Here I only
want to discuss few points that I believe must be considered as part of
the answer.

**Capitalism is terminally unsustainable -- empirics are on our side**

**Sauga '15** (Michael, Der Spiegel writer, "The Zombie System: How
Capitalism Has Gone Off the Rails",
<http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/capitalism-in-crisis-amid-slow-growth-and-growing-inequality-a-998598-4.html>)

The buzzword is \"[inclusion]{.underline}\" and it [refers to a trait
that Western industrialized nations seem to be on the verge of losing:
the ability to allow as many layers of society as possible to benefit
from economic advancement and participate in political
life]{.underline}. The term is now even being used at meetings of a more
exclusive character, as was the case in London in May. Some 250 wealthy
and extremely wealthy individuals, from Google Chairman Eric Schmidt to
Unilever CEO Paul Polman, gathered in a venerable castle on the Thames
River to lament the fact that in today\'s capitalism, [[there is too
little left over for the lower income classes]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Former US President Bill Clinton found fault with the \"uneven
distribution of opportunity,\" while IMF Managing Director Christine
Lagarde was critical of the numerous financial scandals. The hostess of
the meeting, investor and bank heir Lynn Forester de Rothschild, said
she was concerned about social cohesion, noting that citizens had \"lost
confidence in their governments.\" It isn\'t necessary, of course, to
attend the London conference on \"inclusive capitalism\" to realize that
industrialized countries have a problem. When the Berlin Wall came down
25 years ago, the West\'s liberal economic and social order seemed on
the verge of an unstoppable march of triumph. Communism had failed,
politicians worldwide were singing the praises of deregulated markets
and US political scientist Francis Fukuyama was invoking the \"end of
history.\" [Today, [no one talks anymore about the beneficial effects of
unimpeded capital movement]{.mark}]{.underline}. Today\'s issue is
\"secular stagnation,\" as former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers
puts it. [[The]{.mark} American [economy isn\'t growing]{.mark} even
[half as quickly as]{.mark} did in [the]{.mark} 19[90s]{.mark}. [Japan
has become the sick man of Asia]{.mark}. And [Europe is sinking into a
recession]{.mark} that has begun to slow down the German export machine
and threaten prosperity. Capitalism in the 21st century is a capitalism
of uncertainty]{.underline}, as became evident once again last week.
[[All it took were a few disappointing US trade figures and suddenly
markets plunged worldwide]{.mark}, from the American bond market to
crude oil trading]{.underline}. It seemed only fitting that the
turbulence also affected the bonds of the country that has long been
seen as an indicator of jitters: Greece. The financial papers called it
a \"flash crash.\" Running Out of Ammunition
[[Politicians]{.underline}]{.mark} and business leaders everywhere
[[are]{.mark} now [calling for new growth initiatives]{.mark}, [but
**the governments\' arsenals are empty**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The
billions spent on economic stimulus]{.mark} packages following the
financial crisis [have created mountains of debt]{.mark} in most
industrialized countries [and]{.mark} they [now lack funds for new
spending programs]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Central banks are]{.mark} also
[running out of ammunition]{.mark}. [They have pushed interest rates
close to zero and have spent hundreds of billions to buy government
bonds]{.mark}. Yet **[the vast amounts of money they are pumping into
the financial sector isn\'t making its way into the economy.]{.mark}**
Be it in Japan, Europe or the United States, companies are hardly
investing in new machinery or factories anymore]{.underline}. Instead,
[[prices are exploding on the global stock, real estate and bond
markets, a dangerous boom driven by cheap money, not by sustainable
growth]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Experts]{.underline}]{.mark} [with the
Bank for International Settlements [have]{.mark} already [identified
\"worrisome signs\" of an impending crash in many areas.]{.mark} In
addition to creating new risks, **[the West\'s crisis policy is also
exacerbating conflicts in the industrialized nations]{.mark}**
themselves. While workers\' wages are stagnating and traditional savings
accounts are yielding almost nothing, the wealthier classes \-- those
that derive most of their income by allowing their money to work for
them \-- are profiting handsomely.]{.underline} According to the latest
Global Wealth Report by the Boston Consulting Group, worldwide private
wealth grew by about 15 percent last year, almost twice as fast as in
the 12 months previous. The data expose a dangerous malfunction in
capitalism\'s engine room. Banks, mutual funds and investment firms used
to ensure that citizens\' savings were transformed into technical
advances, growth and new jobs. Today they organize the redistribution of
social wealth from the bottom to the top. The middle class has also been
negatively affected: [For years, many average earners have seen their
prosperity shrinking instead of growing]{.underline}. [[Harvard
economist]{.mark} Larry [Katz rails that **US society has come to
resemble a deformed and unstable apartment building: The penthouse at
the top is getting bigger and bigger, the lower levels are overcrowded,
the middle levels are full of empty apartments and the elevator has
stopped working.**]{.mark}]{.underline} \'Wider and Wider\' [It\'s no
wonder]{.underline}, then, [that people can no longer get much out of
the system]{.underline}. According to polls by the Allensbach Institute,
only one in five Germans believes economic conditions in Germany are
\"fair.\" Almost 90 percent feel that the gap between rich and poor is
\"getting wider and wider.\" In this sense, [[the crisis of capitalism
has turned into a crisis of democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Many feel
that their countries are no longer being governed by parliaments and
legislatures, but by bank lobbyists, which apply the logic of suicide
bombers to secure their privileges]{.mark}: Either they are rescued or
they drag the entire sector to its death]{.underline}.

The U.S. Imperial Triangle Today What does the foregoing tell us in
relation to our original question? Is it reasonable to argue, as
Hobsbawm and others have, that the expansion of U.S. militarism and
imperialism in the present period is the result of "a group of political
crazies," who have come to power in Washington and constructed a
"radical right-wing regime" abounding in "megalomania"? As an
explanation of the current phase of U.S. empire this is clearly
inadequate. Despite the often neoconservative nature of the Bush
administration's top operatives, they have had the broad backing of the
greater part of the establishment in the wars on Afghanistan and Iraq,
the War on Terrorism as a whole, the huge military buildup, etc. To be
sure, if a Democratic administration under Al Gore had come into power
in 2000 it is not at all certain that the United States would have gone
to war with Iraq, in addition to Afghanistan, though an attempt would
have been made to uphold U.S. imperial interests. The Bush
administration from the first was distinguished by the particularly
bellicose group of neoconservatives at its helm. But in pursuing their
belligerent ends they hardly lacked solid backing within the circles of
power. Strong support was extended by both political parties, Congress,
the judiciary, the media, and the corporations generally. Disagreements
were largely about troop levels, the amount of force to be applied,
relations to allies, dates of withdrawal (partial or whole),
distribution of forces between the major "theaters," etc. More
fundamental questions, even the use of torture, were avoided. Major
dissent has mainly come from the bottom of the society. All of this
suggests that expanded **[[militarism and imperialism is deeply
entrenched at present]{.underline}]{.mark}**, at least within the top
echelons of U.S. society. [**[It reflects a general concern to expand
U.S. hegemony as part of an imperial grand strategy]{.mark}, including
rolling back insurgent forces and "rogue states" around the world, and
keeping** junior **partners in line**]{.underline}. The war in [**[Iraq
is]{.mark}** best viewed as **[an attempt to assert U.S. geopolitical
control over the]{.mark}**]{.underline} entire **[[Persian Gulf and its
oil]{.underline}]{.mark}**---an objective that both political wings of
the establishment support, and **[[which is part of the larger aim of
the restoration of a grand U.S. hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark}**.27
**[The vast scale of U.S. military
spending]{.underline}**---encompassing more than 50 percent of the
federal budget (excluding social security, medicare, and other transfer
payments) and constituting 7 percent of the entire
GDP---**[is]{.underline}** thus externally **[rooted in the needs
of]{.underline}** the U.S**[. imperial grand strategy,
which]{.underline}** continually **[strains the]{.underline}** U.S.
**[system to its limits]{.underline}** (as measured by the budget and
trade deficits). U.S. imperialism has been transformed in recent decades
by the absence of the Soviet Union, giving the United States more
immediate power (particularly in the military realm), coupled,
paradoxically, with signs of a secular decline in U.S. economic
hegemony. It is this dual reality of a temporary increase in U.S. power
along with indications of its long-term decline that has led to urgent
calls throughout the power elite for a "New American Century," and to
attempts by Washington to leverage its enormous military power to regain
economic and geopolitical strength, for example, in the Persian Gulf oil
region. In recent years, **[the U]{.underline}**nited [**S**tates **has
enormously expanded its military bases and operations around the world
with bases now in around seventy countries and U.S. troops present in
various capacities**]{.underline} (including joint exercises) **[in
perhaps twice that number]{.underline}**. **[[Washington
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** thus **[not just spending [money on]{.mark}
the military and]{.underline}** producing [[destructive
weapons]{.underline}, [**or** engaging in wars **and
interventions.**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[It is]{.underline}** also
[**building a lasting physical presence around the world that allows
for** control/subversion/rapid deployment]{.underline}.28 As a further
reason not to dismiss the new surge in U.S. militarism and imperialism
as merely the "megalomania" of a few, our argument points back to
Kalecki's imperial triangle, as constituting the principal dilemma
facing opponents of imperialism. **[[The creation of a huge military
establishment to serve the U.S. empire was also
understood]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in military-Keynesian terms, **[[as a
quasi-full-employment strategy aimed at combating economic stagnation.
With the help of the media]{.underline}]{.mark}** (which, as General
Electric Wilson insisted, had the task of "marshalling" public opinion
in support of the permanent war economy), **[the distinctive foundations
of post--Second World War U.S. capitalism were laid.]{.underline}** The
growth of the antiwar movement in response to the Vietnam War, and the
end of the Cold War, represented setbacks for the imperial triangle,
which showed up in terms of temporary drops in military spending as a
percentage of GDP. **[Each time, in the]{.underline}** late
19**[70]{.underline}**s/early 19**[80s]{.underline}** **[and again in
the late]{.underline}** 19**[90s]{.underline}**/**[early]{.underline}**
**[2000s]{.underline}**, such temporary **[lulls in military spending
have been followed by]{.underline}** a military
**[resurgence]{.underline}**.29 For Kalecki the weak link in the
imperial triangle was clearly the mass media propaganda system, which
had the job of selling the permanent war economy to a population that
could conceivably opt for other more rational, just, and egalitarian
courses. Unlike the Korean War or the Vietnam War, the Iraq War (like
the Gulf War before it) was preceded by a massive antiwar movement in
the United States, demonstrating the willingness of perhaps a majority
of the population to seek another way, opposed to militarism and
imperialism. **[It was the monopoly media]{.underline}**, far more
concentrated than in Luce's day and now virtually indistinguishable from
monopoly-finance capital (becoming simply its public voice), **[that
came to the rescue of U.S. war capitalism in its moment of need, giving
credence to its obvious lies.]{.underline}** "**[The
press]{.underline}**," as one of us has written, "**[was]{.underline}**
\[soon\] **[eating out of the Bush]{.underline}** administration's
**[bowl]{.underline}**."30 **[In a period of economic
stagnation]{.underline}**, **[financial crisis]{.underline}**,
**[declining hegemony]{.underline}**, **[impending environmental
collapse]{.underline}**, **[and new populist
insurgencies]{.underline}**, **[Washington]{.underline}**, representing
the U.S. oligarchy as a whole, **[was]{.underline}** once again **[able
to enlist the media]{.underline}** monopoly **[in the marshaling of
public opinion in support of the imperial project]{.underline}** through
the promotion of war hysteria. **[What made this possible was the prior
existence of a]{.underline}** well-oiled, privatized **[propaganda
system designed to limit the range of legitimate debate in the
mainstream media]{.underline}**. In this system **[even the outer
reaches of the quite timid liberal punditocracy were]{.underline}**
strictly **[walled-in to fit within the proscribed boundaries of elite
debate]{.underline}**. Today fundamental [**[dissent toward the
existence of the military-imperial system]{.underline}**,]{.mark} no
matter how thoughtful or well-informed, [[**is** decidedly
off-limits]{.underline}]{.mark}, except for periodic ridicule. **[Ours
is decidedly a "military-industrial-media complex]{.underline}**."31
Nevertheless, **[the imperial triangle is now increasingly confronted
with its own contradictions]{.underline}**. As Baran and Sweezy foresaw
more than four decades ago in Monopoly Capital, the U.S. military system
faced two major internal obstacles. First, **[military spending tended
to be tech]{.underline}**nologically **[intensive]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** hence **[its employment stimulating effect was
decreasing]{.underline}**. "Ironically," they observed, "**[the huge
military outlays of today]{.underline}** may even be
**[contribut]{.underline}**ing substantially **[to an increase of
unemployment]{.underline}**: many of the new technologies which are
byproducts of military research and development are also applicable to
civilian production, where **[they are quite likely to have the effect
of raising productivity and reducing the demand for
labor]{.underline}**." Second, [[**expansion of "**weapons of total
destruction**"**]{.mark} **and the devastating effects of the use of
more powerful weapons, [could be expected to generate a growing
rebellion against the permanent war economy at all levels of
society]{.mark}, as people perceive**]{.underline}d the **[dangers
of]{.underline}** [global]{.underline} barbarism (or worse,
[annihilation]{.underline}).32 Today [**the enormous weight of
Washington's war machine has not prevented it from being** stretched to
its limits]{.underline} while becoming bogged down in Iraq and
Afghanistan. Although still capable of great destruction, **[the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[is]{.underline}**
significantly **[limited in its ability to deploy massive force to
achieve its ends]{.underline}** whenever and wherever it wishes. **[The
dream of Pax Americana]{.underline}**, first presented by John F.
Kennedy at the height of the Cold War**[, has turned into]{.underline}**
the **[nightmare]{.underline}** of Pox Americana in the years of waning
U.S. dominance. The role the media monopoly has assumed in recent years
in the promotion of war propaganda has contributed to the rapid growth
of a media reform movement, which is now challenging the concentration
of communications in the United States.33 There is no doubt that **[a
society that supports its global position]{.underline}** and social
order **[through \$1 trillion a year in military
spending,]{.underline}** most likely far exceeding that of all the other
countries in the world put together, **[unleashing]{.underline}** untold
**[destruction on the world]{.underline}**, **[while faced with
intractable problems of inequality]{.underline}**, economic
**[stagnation]{.underline}**, **[financial crisis]{.underline}**,
**[poverty]{.underline}**, **[waste]{.underline}**, **[and environmental
decline]{.underline}** at home, **[is]{.underline}** a society that is
**[ripe for change]{.underline}**. It is our task to change it.

**[A2: Environment Resilient]{.underline}**

**Environmental resilience theory gets co-opted by corporate elites and

That said, [we need to be cautious about romanticizing the noncompliance
that may inhere in a targeted resource]{.underline}: [relative to the
accelerated plunder involved]{.underline}, say, [in the \"second
scramble\"]{.underline} for Africa-as American, Australian, Chinese,
European, and South African corporations cash in on resource-rich,
regulation-poor, war-fractured societies-[[the resistance posed by
nature itself should not be overstated]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[The]{.mark} recent [turn]{.mark}]{.underline} within environmental
studies [[toward celebrating the creative resilience of
ecosystems]{.mark} **[can be readily hijacked by
politicians]{.mark}**]{.underline}, lobbyists, **[[and corporations who
oppose regulatory controls and strive to minimize pollution
liability]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Co-opting the
\"nature-and-time-will-heal\" argument has become integral to attempts
to privatize profits while externalizing risk and cleanup]{.underline},
both of which can be delegated to \"nature\'s business.\" [This was
dramatically illustrated by the Deepwater Horizon disaster]{.underline}-
in the laxity that contributed to the blowout and in the aftermath. [Big
Oil and government agencies both invoked natural resilience as an
advance strategy for minimizing oversight]{.underline}. Before the
blowout, the Minerals Management Service of the U.S. Interior Department
had concluded that \"spills in deep water are not likely to affect
listed birds \.... Deepwater spills would either be transported away
from coastal habitats or prevented, for the most part, from reaching
coastal habitats by natural weathering processes.?\" Even after the
disaster, this line of reasoning persisted. Oil industry apologist Rep.
Don Young (R-AK), testifying at congressional hearings on the blowout,
knew exactly how to mine this \"natural agency\" logic: the Deepwater
Horizon spill was \"not an environmental disaster,\" he declared. \"I
will say that again and again because it is a natural phenomenon. Oil
has seeped into this ocean for centuries, will continue to do it\.... We
will lose some birds, we will lose some fixed sea-life, but overall it
will recover.?\" BP spokesman John Curry likewise explained how
industrious microbes would cleanse the oil from the gulf: \"Nature,\" he
concluded sanguinely, \"has a way of helping the situation.\'\" [BP
representatives repeatedly invoked the capacity of marine life to
metabolize hydrocarbons and the dispersing powers of microbial
degradation. But in conscripting nature as a volunteer clean up crew, BP
and its Washington allies downplayed the way ravenous microbes, in
consuming oxygen, thereby starved other organisms and exacerbated
expanding oceanic dead zones]{.underline}.\" [What will be the long-term
cascade effect of the slow violence]{.underline}, the mass die-offs, of
phyloplankton [at the food chain base]{.underline}? It is far too early
to tell. In short, [the very environment that high-risk, deep-water
drilling endangered was conscripted by industry through a kind of
natural outsourcing]{.underline}. And so [Big Oil\'s [invocation of
nature\'s healing powers needs to be recognized as part of a broader
strategy of image management]{.mark}]{.underline} and liability
limitation by greenwashing. Natural agency can indeed take unexpected,
sometimes heartening forms, but we should be alert to the ways corporate
colossi and governments can hijack that logic to grant themselves
advance or retrospective absolution. Crucially, for my arguments about
slow violence, [the [time frames of damage assessment and]{.mark}
potential [recovery are]{.mark} wildly [out of sync]{.mark}. The
deep-time [thinking that celebrates natural healing is]{.mark}
strategically [disastrous if it provides political cover for

become significant again98. But Dafoe's approach can be problematic as
well, because these nations may be open to each other while staying
closed to the west or the global financial markets. In case of North
Korea, foreign capital from the U .S.S.R and China are pivotal to the
survival of the regime.

index is negatively associated with more conflict101. As Dafoe points
out, [[Gartzke's finding can be damaged by]{.mark} the [missing values
in his]{.mark} market openness [variable]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and the
temporal dependence and cross-sectional dependence are not properly
controlled]{.underline}102. [[Model 1 pays]{.mark} close [attention to
these problems]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [and finds]{.underline}]{.mark}
[that]{.underline}, at least in this period, [[market openness]{.mark}
is positively [associated with]{.mark} more
[conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the data of this paper focuses on a
different time period, this result does not suggest Gartzke is wrong,
but further explanation of why market openness is positively associated
with more conflict is necessary. The low value of democracy is
negatively associated with conflicts, and this finding is consistent
with the argument of democratic peace theory. The positive impact of the
high value of democracy possibly shows that a discrepant dyad---when the
democracy low value is controlled---is more likely to fight each other.
As Choi points out, the interpretation of the democracy high variable is
often difficult, but it seems the democratic peace theory is well
supported by this data. The traditional commercial peace theory, which
focuses on the trade dependency created by international commodity
trade, is also supported by this model. Development makes noncontiguous
states more likely to fight each other, as the development facilitated
the capacity of states to project power to a longer distance, but
development also makes contiguous states less likely to fight each
other103. This finding supports that the interaction effect between
contiguity and development is also robust in this period. Being a major
power makes the state more likely to be involved in conflicts. Similar
to this finding, a state is more likely to be involved in MIDs if its
national power index is higher. However, formal alliances have no
significant impact on the probability of MIDs. Model 2 replaces the high
value of democracy with the democracy distance variable104 . Since the
democracy distance variable is a linear transformation of the high value
of democracy105 , this replacement produces identical results to Model
1, but the interpretation of democratic peace in this model is much
easier. The positive and significant impact of the democracy distance
variable supports the expectation from Choi: politically different
countries--- the authoritarian states and the democratic states---are
more likely to fight each other 106 . Different political ideology can
be the underlining reason for tension. As this paper suggests before,
since many pacifying mechanisms available for democracies do not exist
in autocratic and discrepant dyads, the same democracy distance should
have different impact in different types of dyad. Model 3.1 applies this
proposal and makes the lower value of democracy interact with the
democracy distance variable. The findings are impressive: The negative
coefficient of the lower value of democracy becomes significant again;
the coefficient of democracy distance loses its significance, but the
interaction effects between these two variables are positively
significant. This finding supports the democratic peace argument:
countries are less likely to fight if they both are highly democratic,
but this pacifying effect has been mitigated if the democracy distance
is getting bigger. Figure 1 presents a prediction of the probability of
conflict based on Model 3.1. It shows that the probability of conflict
is almost the same for autocratic and discrepant dyads, and both of them
are much higher than the probability for democratic dyads. Model 3.2
replaces the low value of democracy with a three-category indicator of
dyad type 107 and makes the dyad type indicator interacting with the
democracy distance variable. The result shows that, compared with the
base category (democratic dyad), the risk of fighting is higher in the
other two types of dyads. In the base category, democratic distance does
not have significant impact on their chance of fighting. Figure 2 shows
how the predicted probability of conflict, based on Model 3.2, changes
across different dyad types. The predicted probability shows that one
can confidently claim that democratic dyads are more peaceful than other
types of dyad, but the upward trend, which is similar to the trend
showing in the predicted chance of fighting for autocracies, shows that
bigger democracy distance leads to more conflicts in these two types of
dyads. The discrepant dyad group generally behaves similarly to the
autocracy group, except that the downward trend of the curve, showing
that instead of fighting for different democratic ideology, shows
discrepant dyads often fight for other reasons. However, the confidence
interval of the discrepant dyad group largely overlaps with the
confidence interval of the autocracy group, so more data are needed to
distinguish whether discrepant dyads behave differently from autocracy
dyads. In conclusion, this paper argues that the democratic peace model
can be improved by interacting the democracy distance variable with the
other democracy measurement of the dyad. Findings from these interaction
models support the dyadic claim that ―democratic countries are unlikely
to fight each other‖, but they also suggest one cannot extend this claim
to the monadic level. Democratic countries are not more peaceful, as the
chance of conflicts is high in a discrepant dyad. Increasing ideological
differences, as measured by the democracy distance variable in these
models, can increase the chances of conflicts. On the commercial peace
aspect, Model 1 of this paper suggests that [higher market openness can
lead to more conflicts. This]{.underline} positive correlation [might be
explained by the spillover effect of market fluctuation]{.underline}. In
order to capture the impact of market fluctuation, Model 4 added a set
of variables related to the measurement of foreign capital net inflows
to the model. The results show that, once the capital flow factors are
considered in the model, the market openness variable loses its
significance, and [a [higher]{.mark} level of [capital]{.mark} net
[inflow is]{.mark} positively [associated with]{.mark} more [interstate
conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}. The missing value indicator of capital
net inflows is included in the model to control the damage caused by
missing data in the capital net inflow variable. This missing indicator
is positive and significant, suggesting that missing economic data are
systematically associated with militarized conflicts. The lagged capital
net inflows variable, measured as the percentage of GDP, is included in
the model, and higher level of capital net inflows is associated with a
higher risk of conflicts. [The change of capital net inflow
variable]{.underline}, which is measured by the level of current capital
net inflows minus the level of the one-year lagged capital net inflows,
[is also positively associated with more conflicts, meaning]{.underline}
[the [risk of conflict is higher if there are more foreign capitals
pouring into the country]{.mark}]{.underline}. [These findings support
the theory]{.underline} of this paper [that large [capital
inflows]{.mark} can [destabilize the]{.mark} domestic [economy]{.mark}
and cause crises]{.underline}, but they are also contrary to the
conventional understanding that foreign capital will leave the
conflicting region. However, it can be explained by the following
reasons.

[This chapter explored]{.underline} the state of theory and [evidence on
the capitalist peace]{.underline} and its prospects for explaining the
democratic peace. [[Two]{.mark} kinds]{.underline} [of [capitalist peace
theories were distinguished]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [the free-market and
the social-market]{.underline}]{.mark}, yielding four observable causal
mechanisms: trade, capital openness, and size of private sector as
free-market theories, and contract-intensive economy as the
social-market theory. [[Analyses]{.mark} of]{.underline} [these causal
mechanisms [indicate]{.mark}]{.underline} that [the [free-market
theories are not]{.mark} [viable]{.mark} explanations]{.underline}
[for]{.underline} the democratic peace or the [peace among]{.underline}
the [advanced industrial nations]{.underline}, primarily because none of
them correlate substantially with democracy or developed democracy; they
do not even correlate much with each other. [[Only]{.mark} the
[social-market]{.mark} measure]{.underline} of contract-intensive
economy [[correlates]{.mark} moderately [with
democracy]{.mark}]{.underline} and developed democracy. Application of
the theories to the case of [the [Falklands]{.mark}]{.underline}/
Malvinas War yields similar results: this war [[appears
as]{.underline}]{.mark} an [[anomalous]{.underline}]{.mark} case [for
the]{.underline} trade (Weede 1996) and [capital openness
(Gartzke]{.underline} et al. 2001) [models]{.underline}, while the
public sector model (McDonald 2007) identifies Britain as a
non-capitalist state; only the social-market model (Mousseau 2000)
offers an account for this conflict. Finally, [[analyses]{.mark}
of]{.underline} fatal [militarized interstate disputes]{.underline} from
1961 to 2001 [[corroborate that]{.mark} the [democratic peace is
spurious]{.mark}]{.underline}, with contract-intensive economy the more
likely explanation for both democracy and the \"democratic\" peace. The
[[free-market theories]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[face]{.underline}
[problems of internal and external validity]{.underline}.]{.mark}
[Regarding internal validity]{.underline}, [to account for a peace
between developed nations]{.underline}, [all of [these]{.mark}
theories]{.underline} [critically [assume]{.mark} that free [markets
cause economic development]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Yet]{.underline} the
[[scientific evidence tells us this is not so]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Gurr, Jaggers, and Moore 1990). Regarding external validity, for all
but the most myopic observers of global affairs it is clear that the
peace among the advanced capitalist nations is much more than restraint
due to the high cost of killing each other (Weede 1996), fear of each
other\'s resolve (Gartzke et al. 2001), or the credibility in their
commitments (McDonald 2007). These theories may be correct, but it is
apparent that these nations do more than just tolerate each other; they
are friends. This is evident from the fact that whenever a capitalist
economy takes a turn for the worse, the other capitalist nations seek to
boost it back up, overcoming collective action problems with
negotiations enhanced by shared norms of equity and law. The capitalist
nations are not better balancers: they do not balance. They do not
simply read each other\'s signals better or send or receive better
information: they know that other capitalist nations will never attack
them. Indeed, the very image of war today between France and Germany is
comical, yet until they became market capitalist only five decades ago
these two nations slaughtered each other with seeming zeal roughly every
generation.

The third causal mechanism is [socialization theory]{.underline}.
[Market integration provides more forums allowing national policy makers
to meet, thus]{.underline} policy transparency can be increased, and
[misinterpretations, which can lead to more conflicts, are
reduced]{.underline}62 . Similar policy interests can also be developed
through the socialization processes63. \*\*\*TO FOOTNOTES\*\*\* 63 [This
is the hypothesis 3 in Gartzke's Capitalist Peace argument]{.underline}.

argues that [[as the number of contracts increases through]{.mark}
international [market integration]{.mark}, the number of contract
[default will also]{.mark} increase]{.underline}64;
[therefore]{.underline}, [socialization under globalization can work in
a negative way [and make conflicts more]{.mark}
[likely]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the other hand, the
[socialization]{.underline} effect [caused by financial market
integration can be limited]{.underline}, as the highly professionalized
nature of financial markets creates interactions only within a small
group of experts. Chewieroth suggests that state leaders often have
little to say in the norm building of international financial structure,
and the self-interested bureaucrats of IMF and other international
financial organizations have a significant impact on financial
liberalization65. These discussions suggest there are some reasons to
argue that the pacifying effects of financial liberalization are not as
strong as commodity international trade. The causal mechanisms of
conventional commercial peace may not function well with the financial
integration. Furthermore, [the possible]{.underline} [[negative impact
of]{.mark} [liberalization]{.mark}]{.underline} [[needs to be
considered]{.underline}]{.mark}, [as liberalization does not always
bring stability]{.underline}. [Financial [market
fluctuations]{.mark}]{.underline}, often [marked by significant amount
of capital inflows and outflows, can]{.underline} [[destabilize economy
and cause further crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}. While the negative impact
of large capital outflows, often known as the capital flight, are well
recognized, this paper suggests that [large capital inflows can be risky
too]{.underline}. One can observe a large foreign capital inflow in
cases of speculative accumulation, which often leads to financial crises
when market confidence starts to collapse. The Asian Crisis in 1997 is
an example of this type of crisis66. A large capital inflow also can be
observed if the state is consistently borrowing from international
financial markets to fix its budget deficits, such as the case in the
2011 Euro crisis. In both cases, [[large capital]{.mark} net
[inflows]{.mark}]{.underline} [[destabilize the economy]{.mark} and
causes economic crisis]{.underline}. In the processes discussed above,
[higher level of financial [deregulation provides the tool for states to
borrow]{.mark} more from foreign capitals market, and]{.underline} it
also [[encourages]{.mark} foreign capitals to take the [risk]{.mark} of
entering a foreign market,]{.underline} as liberalization guarantee
foreign capitals can pull out at any time as they want. For these
reasons, it is reasonable to observe increasing capital net inflows67
before a crisis breaks out, and [a higher level of [liberalization
increases]{.mark} the [vulnerability]{.mark} of the state]{.underline}.
These discussions lead to the Hypothesis 5 and 6 of this thesis. H5: [A
higher level of financial [liberalization leads to
a]{.mark}]{.underline} [[higher chance of]{.mark} having militarized
[interstate conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}. H6: [A higher level of
capital flight leads to a]{.underline} [higher chance of having
militarized interstate Conflicts]{.underline}.

Erik [Gartzke's]{.underline} prize-winning [paper "the Capitalist
Peace]{.underline}" is a pioneer of testing the relations between market
openness in this new era and interstate conflicts by combining
commercial peace data and economic data on market openness4 . He [finds
that if two states have a higher level of market openness, they are less
likely to have interstate conflicts]{.underline}5 . His findings also
challenge the democratic peace theory, as he finds that democracy has no
significant correlation with peace once control for market openness6 .
These findings raise questions of the two major components---democratic
peace and commercial peace---of the liberal peace model. Some [[recent
studies]{.mark} [challenge Gartzke]{.mark} by arguing that]{.underline}
1.) [[His measurement of democracy is problematic]{.underline}]{.mark}7

new liberal peace model---a model in which democracy and market openness
are properly measured, and dependence across cases are properly
controlled. This thesis tries to build and test such a model with data
focusing on later time periods when the data availability is better. In
section 2, this paper reviews the current debate on the two pillars of
liberal peace---democratic peace theory and commercial peace theory, and
suggests some new measurements to improve conventional quantitative
studies on liberal peace. Section 3 reviews the debate on methodological
issues, such as the proper way to control temporal dependence, and
proposes a new statistical model to test the liberal peace theory.

**Capitalism reduces conflict-last 3 decades prove**

(John, "Economic Freedom And Conflict Reduction: Evidence From The
1970s, 1980s, And 1990s",

[The last three decades have witnessed an unprecedented expansion of
market-based reforms and the profusion of economic freedom in the
international system]{.underline}. This shift in economic policy has
sparked a debate about whether free markets are superior to state
controls. Numerous studies have compared the neoliberal and statist
policies on issues of production capacity, economic growth, commercial
volumes, and egalitarianism. An overlooked research agenda, however, is
the relationship between levels of economic freedom and violence within
countries. Proponents of the statist approach might note that a strong
government can bend the market to its will, directing activity toward
policies necessary to achieve greater levels of gross domestic product
and growth. By extracting more resources for the economy, a powerful
state can redistribute benefits to keep the populace happy. Higher taxes
can also pay for an army and police force that intimidate people. Such
governments range from command economies of totalitarian systems to
autocratic dictators and military juntas. Other economically unfree
systems include some of the authoritarian "Asian tigers." A [combination
of historical evidence, modern theorists, and statistical findings,
however, has indicated that a reduced role for the state in regulating
economic transactions is associated with a decrease in internal
conflicts. Countries where the government dominates the commercial realm
experience an increase in the level of domestic violen]{.underline}ce.
Scholars have traced the history of revolutions to explain the
relationship between statism and internal upheavals. [Contemporary
authors also posit a relationship between economic liberty and peace

and conflict reduction during the past three decades.**]{.underline}

**[A2: Squo Improving (Goklany)]{.underline}**

#### Goklany's wrong, oversimplified, and neolib destroys all the reasons the status quo is improving 

James **Surowiecki 7**, journalist and financial writer for The New
Yorker, 7/18/7, "The Myth of Inevitable Progress,"
http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/07/the_myth_of_inevitable_progres.hstml

\"Day by day, in every way, I am getting better and better.\" That
mantra, invented by the self-taught psychologist Émile Coué in the
nineteenth century, kept running through my head as I read Indur
Goklany\'s new book on the relationship between economic growth and
human and environmental progress, The Improving State of the World. Just
as Coué told his patients that incessant repetition of his mantra would
make it come true, [Goklany seems to believe]{.underline} that [saying
often enough]{.underline} \-- and in enough different ways \-- [that
life today is better]{.underline} than ever [will make it
so]{.underline}. [Goklany depicts a global economy in which]{.underline}
nearly [all signs are positive]{.underline} \-- [and]{.underline} in
which the [problems]{.underline} that do exist, such as stagnation or
setbacks in sub-Saharan Africa and the former Soviet Union, [will be
solved if economic growth and technological improvements are allowed to
work]{.underline} their magic. Nor is this, in Goklany\'s account, a new
phenomenon. He marshals an impressive array of historical data to argue
that the trajectory of the twentieth century has been generally upward
and onward. Taken as a whole, Goklany argues, humanity really has been
getting better and better day by day, so that today, as his subtitle
puts it, \"we\'re living longer, healthier, more comfortable lives on a
cleaner planet.\" Seen from a broad historical perspective, this
description is, for most people, accurate enough. Just about everyone
living today is the beneficiary of what can almost certainly be called
the single most consequential development in human history \-- namely,
the onset of industrialization. As the economic historian Angus Maddison
has shown in a series of studies of economic development over the past
two millennia, human economies grew very little, if at all, for most of
human history. Between 1000 and 1820 or so, Maddison estimates, annual
economic growth was around 0.05 percent a year \-- which meant that
living standards improved incredibly slowly and that people living in
1800 were only mildly better off than people living in 1000. But
sometime around 1820, that all began to change. Between 1820 and today,
world per capita real income grew 20 times as fast as it did in the
previous eight centuries. In the West, above all, the effects of this
transformation have been so massive as to be practically unfathomable.
Real income, life expectancy, literacy and education rates, and food
consumption have soared, while infant mortality, hours worked, and food
prices have plummeted. And although the West has been the biggest
beneficiary of these changes, the diffusion of technology, medicine, and
agricultural techniques has meant that developing countries have enjoyed
dramatic improvements in what the United Nations calls \"human
development indicators,\" even if most of their citizens remain poor.
One consequence of this is that people at a given income level today are
likely to be healthier and to live longer than people at the same income
level did 40 or 50 years ago. In one sense, all of this should be
obvious, since a moment\'s thought \-- or a quick read of a
nineteenth-century novel \-- should suffice to remind you of how much
better, at least in material terms, life is today than it was a century
ago, let alone in the 1600s. But as behavioral economists have
persuasively demonstrated, human beings quickly adapt to their
surroundings and come to take their current state of affairs for
granted. In other words, it is difficult, even after your life has
changed dramatically for the better, to remain aware of just how much
better it is, and even harder to truly appreciate how much better you
have it than your great-grandparents did. So part of Goklany\'s project
here \-- and it is a valuable part \-- is to make clear just how much
real progress there has been over the past two centuries and even (in
many places) over the past two decades in the life of the average human
being. THE ANTI-MALTHUS Goklany\'s target is not just the natural
tendency of human beings to take things for granted. His real opponents
are what he calls the \"neo-Malthusians\" \-- those who are convinced
that there are natural limits to growth and that humanity has been
butting up against them for quite some time now. The neo-Malthusians had
their heyday in the 1960s and early 1970s, with works such as Paul
Ehrlich\'s The Population Bomb and the Club of Rome\'s appropriately
titled The Limits to Growth. Although their doomsaying about population
growth and industrialization is no longer front-page news, their
deep-seated skepticism about the virtues of economic growth and their
conviction that the richer people get, the worse things become for the
earth remain an important strand of modern environmentalism. If Goklany
sees progress everywhere he looks, the neo-Malthusians see impending
disaster: air pollution, the disappearance of habitats, the emptying of
aquifers, the demolition of forest cover, and the proliferation of new
diseases. Day by day, in every way, in other words, we are getting worse
and worse. The problem with neo-Malthusianism, as Goklany appropriately
suggests, is that it has consistently underestimated the beneficial
effects of technological change. The e = mc2 of the neo-Malthusians was
introduced three decades ago, when Paul Ehrlich and John Holdren
invented the equation I = PAT. Environmental impact (I) was said to be
the product of population size (P), level of affluence (A), and
technological efficiency (T). According to this logic, not only are
population growth and economic growth bad for the earth, but so, too, is
technological change, since it has a multiplier effect on the other two
factors. The only way to save the planet, from the neo-Malthusians\'
perspective, is to set strict limits on human behavior, doing everything
possible to rein in businesses and consumers. The I = PAT formula was
not pulled completely out of thin air. As societies get richer and more
populous, they do consume more resources, and, especially in the early
phases of economic growth, they do so with a measure of indifference to
the overall impact on the environment. But what the equation misses, and
what Goklany spends a good chunk of his book demonstrating, is that
technology can actually reduce environmental impact, thereby diminishing
the demands made by affluence and population growth. A classic example
of this effect is the massive expansion in the efficiency of
agricultural productivity over the past 40 years. Productivity gains
have dramatically reduced the environmental burden of farming (at least
on the land \-- there have not been similar advances in the efficient
use of water) and shrunk the amount of land needed to feed the world.
More recently, technological improvements in the scrubbing of
power-plant smokestacks have brought about a sharp reduction in the
amount of sulfur dioxide in the air. Improvements in the efficiency of
wind and solar power have reduced (albeit only a little) the demand for
fossil fuels. And although the impact of these innovations has been felt
most strongly in the developed world, they have also improved conditions
in the developing world, at least with regard to things such as access
to clean water and some types of air emissions. Goklany may be
exaggerating somewhat when he says that the entire planet \-- as opposed
to just the developed world \-- is cleaner, but it is in fact not an
outrageous claim. The paradox here is that technological change is
generally associated with (or is actually the result of) increased
affluence, which makes it likely that an economy will get cleaner even
as it gets richer. And empirically, that does seem to be the case. After
all, developed countries do generally have cleaner air, cleaner water,
more forest cover, and less cropland devoted to food production than
developing countries do, even though the latter are much poorer. The
obvious, and important, exception is CO2 emissions and the broader
problem of climate change. But Goklany \-- who spends too much of his
book offering an overly familiar critique of excessive action in
response to global warming \-- argues that now that Americans are
increasingly concerned about climate change, technology will soon help
mitigate the problem. All of this does not mean that the United States
is less polluted than it was in 1787, let alone than it was when it was
inhabited only by Native Americans. But it does mean that the United
States is arguably less polluted today than at any time in the last 100
years and that the last 40 years or so, in particular, have seen a
dramatic improvement in the quality of air and water. And the same is
true, to lesser and greater extents, in the rest of the developed world.
One hypothesis for why this has historically occurred is demonstrated by
what is called the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). When graphed, the
relationship between prosperity and environmental degradation looks like
an upside-down U. Initially, as countries grow, they trade off
environmental well-being for economic growth \-- that is, as they get
richer, they also get more polluted. At some point, however, they become
prosperous enough to shift their priorities and begin to seek out ways
to grow more cleanly. Goklany suggests a variation on the EKC, the
\"environmental transition hypothesis,\" which tries to account for time
and technology as well as affluence. The invention and spread of new
technologies, he suggests, make it easier and more likely for countries
to get on the right side of the U-curve quickly, even before they have
become rich; the \"green revolution,\" for instance, allowed poor
countries to reduce the environmental burden of farming. FREE MARKETS,
FREE PEOPLE The environmental transition hypothesis is a reasonable way
of thinking about the relationship between prosperity, technology, and
people\'s expectations about the environment. And Goklany\'s rebuttal to
the environmental doomsayers is both welcome and convincing. So
[why]{.underline}, then, [is his overall take on the world]{.underline}
\-- and in particular on how we got to where we are and what we need to
do to keep things moving in the right direction \--
[unsatisfying]{.underline} in that Couéist way? The simple answer is
that [[Goklany]{.mark}\'s account [leaves out]{.mark} [too much that
matters]{.mark}]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [pretends
that]{.underline} incredibly [complex phenomena can be explained away
with a few catch phrases]{.underline}. In [[its]{.underline}]{.mark}
overly sanguine and [[simplistic take]{.underline}]{.mark} [on
globalization]{.underline}, regulation, [and the role of
state]{.underline} and economic power, The Improving State of the World
[[is]{.mark} symptomatic of]{.underline} what has become, in the eyes of
many, [a quintessentially American point of view]{.underline} \-- a view
[according to which]{.underline} the task of [creating a better world
can]{.underline} ultimately [be boiled down to]{.underline} the motto of
the Wall Street Journal editorial page: \"[[free markets and free
people]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" Free markets and free people are, to be
sure, wonderful things. But what [Goklany offers]{.underline} up in his
book is [[a]{.underline} [fundamentally deterministic
take]{.underline}]{.mark} [on the world]{.underline}: as countries get
richer and more technologically advanced, their citizens (all, or almost
all, of them) naturally get healthier and better educated, eat better,
live longer, and care more about the environment. The free market,
recognizing people\'s resulting desires, delivers the goods they want.
The environmental transition hypothesis is the most striking example of
this view, since it postulates that environmental improvement happens,
as it were, naturally. The reality, of course, is that the fight over
environmental regulation, at least in the United States, was \-- and
remains \-- a fierce one and that environmental skeptics and businesses
have done their best to prevent regulations such as the Clean Air and
Clean Water Acts from ever becoming law. It is also the case that
without those regulations, the \"cleaner planet\" Goklany sees today
would not exist. Goklany attempts the argument that air and water
pollution in the United States were declining long before regulations
were put into effect. Unfortunately, his own evidence shows that
emissions for a host of pollutants peaked right around 1970, when the
Clean Air Act was passed, or after, and myriad studies demonstrate that
the United States\' rivers and lakes are dramatically more swimmable and
fishable today than they were before the Clean Water Act. The point is
that far from being the inevitable product of a strong economy,
[[environmental improvement]{.underline}]{.mark} is often the result of
political struggles that could very easily have gone the other way. It
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[unlikely to occur in the absence of
a]{.mark} strong [state that is]{.mark}
[accountable]{.mark}]{.underline} to its citizens. [Yet Goklany\'s
entire work]{.underline} \-- perhaps not surprisingly for someone at the
libertarian Cato Institute \-- [is predicated on the idea
that]{.underline} [the state mostly functions as an obstacle to the
benevolent workings of the market]{.underline}. This assumption is
especially peculiar in the context of a discussion of pollution, since
[economic theory tells us that]{.underline} [[polluters]{.mark}, in the
absence of regulation, [have no reason to take the costs]{.mark} of
their emissions [into account]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Pollution
is]{.underline}]{.mark} [[the]{.mark} quintessential]{.underline} case
of a negative externality and, accordingly, of [[market
failure]{.underline}]{.mark}: since polluters do not pay the cost of
their pollution, they will produce more than is socially optimal even if
they may reduce their emissions as a byproduct of improvements in
overall efficiency. [The only way]{.underline}, ultimately, [to reduce
pollution is to constrain polluters]{.underline} to do otherwise. It is
not, in other words, free-market-driven economic growth and
technological change alone that make the I = PAT equation false; it is
those things coupled with the right incentives, incentives that the
market by itself cannot provide. [[The]{.underline}]{.mark} same [facile
[assumption]{.mark} [that]{.mark} the unfettered [market is the
solvent]{.mark} for all serious problems [pervades Goklany\'s
discussion]{.mark} of globalization]{.underline} and its impact on
global well-being. As Goklany points out, correctly, it is a myth that
the advent of globalization has been accompanied by a rise in poverty
and inequality. In fact, the percentage of the world\'s population that
is poor has actually fallen over the past two decades (although 2.7
billion people still live on less than \$2 a day). And inequality \-- at
least among individuals globally \-- has actually declined some as well.
The surprisingly persistent picture of globalization as a process
whereby the developed world exploits and immiserates the developing one
is just wrong. The problem, however, is that [the number of [countries
that]{.mark} [have]{.mark}]{.underline} dramaticall[y [improved their
standards of living]{.underline}]{.mark} [in]{.underline} the era of
[globalization [is]{.mark}]{.underline} [surprisingly
[small]{.mark}]{.underline} \-- and most of them are in Asia. So [even
if economic growth is]{.underline}, as it seems to be, [fundamental to
\"the improving state of the world]{.underline},\" [[we have not]{.mark}
done a very good job of figuring out how to [spread the benefits
of]{.mark} that [growth]{.mark} around the globe]{.underline}. As
Goklany acknowledges, the economies of sub-Saharan Africa and the former
Soviet Union have in many cases not just stopped growing but actually
shrunk over the past 15 years or so. Most of Latin America has seen only
trivial economic growth in the past two decades, while even Asia\'s
\"little tigers\" (Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand) \-- whose
economies have grown rapidly since the 1970s \-- have spent much of the
past seven years recovering from the damage wrought by the 1990s Asian
financial crisis. It is true that most of these countries have
nonetheless seen their human development indicators improve, thanks to
the diffusion of technology and health care. But outside of Asia (and a
few places such as Botswana and Chile), the [economic [benefits of
globalization have been hard to find]{.mark}, which is]{.underline}
precisely [why [there has been]{.mark}]{.underline} [such a
[backlash]{.mark}]{.underline} [[against]{.underline}]{.mark} what has
come to be known as [[the Washington consensus]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Goklany argues that it only makes sense to attack globalization if there
is evidence that rich countries are getting richer on the backs of the
poor. But it is not surprising that people are made unhappy by the sight
of others getting richer while they stay the same or actually get
poorer.

**The status quo only appears to be structurally improving because
elites are gaining so much while the masses starve\-\--aggregate

Nonetheless, [some might query whether there really is]{.underline},
actually or potentially, [a 'global']{.underline} organic [crisis,
since]{.underline} [[many parts of the world]{.underline}]{.mark}, [such
as India and China]{.underline}, [[have]{.underline} [continued to grow
and develop]{.underline}]{.mark}; indeed, Craig Murphy has noted that
[many parts of the global South have had a 'good crisis', insofar
as]{.underline} many of the [reforms]{.underline} that they implemented
in response to the Asian financial and economic crisis of 1997--8 have
[made their financial structures and patterns of economic development
more internally robust and better insulated from external financial
shocks]{.underline} originating in New York, London or Tokyo (Murphy
2010). Murphy's point is well made. It is of course important to
emphasize the geographical and social unevenness of both the experience
and impacts of financial and economic crises across the global social
and geopolitical hierarchy. However, [[this is only part of the
story]{.underline}]{.mark}. [It is]{.underline} also [important to
[reflect]{.mark} critically [on the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[nature]{.mark} and quality [of]{.mark} existing [development]{.mark}
patterns]{.underline}, [[particularly]{.mark} those that]{.underline}
serve to [generalize [the]{.mark} dominant model of [market]{.mark}
civilization]{.underline} -- [a development model that
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} [[wasteful, energy]{.mark}-[intensive]{.mark},
consumerist, [ecologically myopic]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.mark}
premised on [cateri]{.mark}ng mainly [to the]{.mark}
[affluent]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, the [development of China and
India is far from the happy story some seem to paint]{.underline} -- a
point that the Chinese leadership seems to have recently acknowledged by
prioritizing redistribution and social welfare in its next five-year
plan, not least to deal with growing social and ecological
contradictions and widespread political unrest. For example, [every day
in [China there are]{.mark} enormous numbers of localized [protests
concerning living conditions and corruption]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Illustrating the displacement of livelihoods and the crisis of social
reproduction that characterizes the present phase of primitive
accumulation in China, the government estimates that 58 million
'left-behind children' (almost 20 per cent of all children in China and
about a half of the children living in the countryside) now live with
their grandparents or in foster centres, because their parents have left
to earn income in the factories and cities (Hille 2011): Mao sent
millions of parents into labour camps and their children to the
countryside; he forced families to abandon the stoves in their homes and
to use communal kitchens and dorms. Even so, Mao failed, ultimately, to
destroy the family as the basic cell of Chinese society. Today, what the
dictator was unable to accomplish with force is being realized instead
by the lure of money. Meanwhile, [[in India, we see mass suicides of
farmers]{.mark} as a debt crisis envelops their lives]{.underline};
elsewhere in the country perhaps as many as 800 million poor people have
been hardly touched by the changes. Most [live in the shadow of 'shining
India']{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} global [situation
is]{.mark}]{.underline} therefore [[replete with]{.mark} deep
[contradictions]{.mark}]{.underline}. [On the one hand, few would deny
that material conditions are improving for many]{.underline} Chinese and
Indians, and that this should continue to be the case. [On the other
hand]{.underline}, [[if]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [market]{.mark}
civilization model of capitalist development]{.underline} not only
continues in the wealthier countries but also [[becomes more
generalized]{.underline}]{.mark} [in]{.underline} India, China and
[other large developing countries]{.underline} such as Brazil
(notwithstanding President Lula's redistributive policies),
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} also [assuming that [the US]{.mark}
rulers]{.underline} [[sustain]{.mark} their [policies and military
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} along similar lines to now in order
[[to]{.underline} [defend and]{.underline}]{.mark} [[extend that
model]{.underline}]{.mark}, I hypothesize that [[the]{.mark} [global
organic crisis will intensify]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Its effects will be
felt in ways that will be uneven geographically, unequal politically and
socially and materially hierarchical]{.underline}. Put differently, [the
organic crisis may also be globalizing across regions and societies at
varying speeds]{.underline}, and it will probably be differentiated in
its effects on life chances and basic conditions of existence,
generating diverse political effects within and across jurisdictions and
throughout the social and political spectrum. Politically, and perhaps
paradoxically, at this moment the global organic crisis has not been
manifested as a crisis of legitimacy in the global North (although less
so in many parts of the global South).However, [the question is: will
this situation persist -- and,]{.underline} indeed,
[[can]{.underline}]{.mark} [the current [neoliberal
frameworks]{.mark}]{.underline} of global leadership retain legitimacy
and credibility while developing a constructive and meaningful set of
policies to [[address it?]{.underline}]{.mark} [If not, [what are the
prospects for]{.mark} [alternative]{.mark} concept[s]{.mark} of global
leadership]{.underline} and frameworks of rule?

"Consumption is Killing Us,""
http://www.academia.edu/666114/Transformation_for_health_and_sustainability_Dualism_and_Anthropocentrism

[Ben Ami]{.underline} (2010) tells us however that growth is good,
consumption is good and we could have \"Ferraris for air. He
[argues]{.underline} that in advanced industrial societies [we have seen
decreases in infant and maternal mortality rates and increasing life
expectancy]{.underline} coupled with control of infections. We live
longer healthier lives. Hans Rosling in his online gapminder series also
points out that [these indicators are also rising in many developing
countries]{.underline}, but he warns that success may literally cost the
earth. So how can consumption be killing us? Well, it isn\'t.
[Goklany]{.underline} (2006) [argues that economic growth]{.underline},
[technological change and free trade]{.underline} has [helped to power a
\"cycle of progress\" that in the last two centuries enabled
unprecedented improvements in every objective measurement of human
well-being]{.underline}. Poverty, hunger, malnutrition, child labor,
illiteracy and unsafe water have ceased to be global norms; infant
mortality has never been lower; and we live longer and healthier lives.
Further, [[Goklany's research]{.mark} [suggests]{.mark} that global
[agricultural productivity is up,]{.mark} food prices are down, hunger
and malnutrition have dropped worldwide]{.underline}, public health has
improved, mortality rates are down, [and life expectancies are
up]{.underline}. So that its then, we are fine. [Except]{.underline}
that [[since he wrote that]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2006 [[the world
saw]{.underline}]{.mark} [one [food crisis in 2008]{.mark}]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [this year]{.underline} 2011 [[the UN\'s]{.mark} Food
and [Agriculture Organisation are]{.mark}]{.underline} [[giving
the]{.mark} global food [market]{.mark} [\'critical\' status]{.mark},
again]{.underline}. [The Millennium Development Goals have still to be
met]{.underline} and maternal and infant mortality is still at numbers
too high in many countries to enable any level of complacency.
[However]{.underline}, [if you view the world]{.underline}
anthropocentrically [[within the frame of]{.mark} reference of consumer
[capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline} and you happen to live in advanced
industrial nations in wealthy suburbs. [[You can]{.underline}]{.mark}
even [[muster]{.mark} hard empirical [evidence]{.mark} to show the
beneficence of the global economic system]{.underline}. [[The
problem]{.mark} with this viewpoint [is time frame]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Seen from the last 200 years]{.underline} [enormous, unprecedented
progress has]{.underline} without doubt [been made]{.underline}. However
[the time frame for a [proper]{.mark} [assessment]{.mark} of the current
global system [is]{.mark}]{.underline} [much [longer]{.mark} than
that]{.underline}. [Even in human time frames the last 200 years is a
very short period]{.underline} of history. Depending on definition, the
Roman Empire lasted over 400 years, and from the steps of the senate,
Julius Ceaser may have dreamed of a millennium of Roman domination.
[World history is littered with the ruins of human
civilizations]{.underline}, hubris comes before a fall. We are not Rome
or Byzantium. [We have controlled the natural environment]{.underline}
(up to a point) [to produce food and shelter for billions. However
[there is a]{.mark}]{.underline} poverty of spirit, a [[neglect of the
\'bottom billion\']{.underline}]{.mark}, [willful [ignorance of]{.mark}
the casualties of [inequalities]{.mark} based capitalism]{.underline},
[a disconnect from [environmental destruction]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[and]{.mark} a]{.underline} [[lack of]{.mark} vision of
[alternatives]{.mark}]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [may lead to more
healthy, sustainable lives]{.underline} [on a finite planet as we bump
up against limits]{.underline}. Of course, assertions about limits needs
some evidence. A key paper in this respect is that which addresses the
issue of planetary boundaries - i.e. that [there are limits to what we
can achieve on this planet]{.underline}, that [[we
need]{.underline}]{.mark} urgently [[to]{.mark} identify]{.underline}
what [these limits]{.underline} are [and]{.underline} then to [address
what socioeconomic conditions would]{.underline} [[allow all of humanity
to live]{.underline}]{.mark} within the planet boundaries. [[If we do
not]{.mark} do this]{.underline}, the argument runs, then the ecosystem
services upon which all of us ([[the biosphere) may]{.mark} well
[collapse]{.mark}]{.underline} [[leading to]{.mark} a]{.underline} [cull
of humanity]{.underline} [in line with]{.underline} the
[[extinction]{.mark}s]{.underline} [we are]{.underline} already
[exacting on the living world]{.underline} right now. Rockstrom et al
(2009) have tried to identify what the key boundaries are and what the
limits are within each. They suggest that humanity has already
transgressed three of nine boundaries: 1. CO2 emissions for climate
change. 2. Biodiversity loss. 3. Biochemical boundaries - the nitrogen
cycle (the phosphorous cycle has not yet been transgressed) The other
boundaries discussed include: 4. Ocean acidification 5. Stratospheric
ozone depletion 6. Global fresh water use 7. Change in land use 8.
Atmospheric aerosol loading (not yet quantified). 9. Chemical pollution
(not yet quantified). They also argue: \"In the last 200 years, humanity
has transitioned into a new geological era---termed the
Anthropocene---which is defined by an accelerating departure from the
stable environmental conditions of the past 12,000 years into a new,
unknown state of Earth\". \"In order to maintain a global environment
that is conducive for human development and well-being, [we
must]{.underline} define and [respect planetary boundaries
that]{.underline} [delineate a \'safe operating space\' for
humanity]{.underline}. We must return to the long-term stable global
environment that nurtured human development\'.

The enormous business literature on global leadership is also concerned
with the problems confronting the transnational capitalist class, but
sees these principally not as political and ecological challenges (and
implicitly questions of legitimacy) but as problems of efficient
corporate management or administration, decision-making and processes,
and cultural and political sensitivity to local conditions. The litmus
test of leadership is the level of profit in global markets. Oddly
enough, relatively neglected in the management literature -- as well as
in much of the literature just reviewed -- are the [many]{.underline}
important [global forums]{.underline} that help to shape the strategic
perspectives of capital and the state. Examples include the World
Business Council on Sustainable Development [and the [scenario planning
used by]{.mark} corporations and [government]{.mark}
agencies]{.underline} (e.g. by Shell, whose methods have been used by
the CIA) [not only to influence policy but also to [anticipate]{.mark}
political [challenges to]{.mark} economic and cultural
[globalization]{.mark}]{.underline}. Organizations such as the World
Economic Forum, the Trilateral Commission and the new Clinton Global
Initiative (CGI) [[bring together]{.mark} dominant globalizing
[elites]{.mark} from government, corporations, universities, political
parties]{.underline}, media, entertainment, the sciences and the arts
[[to]{.underline} [forge a consensus]{.underline}]{.mark} [and to
initiate strategic concepts of global leadership]{.underline}. [[What
seems]{.mark} to]{.underline} be [[missing]{.underline}]{.mark} [from
these initiatives [is]{.mark}]{.underline} precisely what Sklair (2000)
claims was being attempted over a decade ago:
[comprehensive]{.underline} [*[evidence]{.underline}*
[of]{.underline}]{.mark} [well-resourced, broad-based and serious

[global inequality]{.mark}]{.underline}, the [systematic undermining and
dispossession of livelihoods [and]{.mark}]{.underline} [growing threats
to the integrity of [the]{.mark} [biosphere]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The
fact that]{.underline} [this [evidence is not
forthcoming]{.mark}]{.underline} [is]{.underline} perhaps [not
surprising if one reflects on the realities of]{.underline} the existing
state of [relations between rulers and ruled on a world

worry about]{.mark} growing global [inequality]{.mark} and class
polarization]{.underline}, [[or]{.underline}]{.mark}, indeed, [the
future of [the planet]{.mark}]{.underline}, [if there are no powerful
political forces that force them to do so?]{.underline} Perhaps a more
convincing hypothesis is that, [[far from]{.mark} creating [a
coherent]{.mark} redistributive and ecologically [sustainable structure
of]{.mark} [globalization]{.mark}]{.underline} presided over by a

[Evidence continues to mount that industrial civilisation]{.underline},
[driven by a destructive]{.underline} and insatiable [growth imperative,
is]{.underline} [chronically unsustainable]{.underline}, as well as
being grossly unjust. [[The]{.mark} global [economy is in ecological
overshoot]{.mark}]{.underline}, currently [[consuming resources and
emitting waste]{.mark} [at rates]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the planet
cannot]{.mark} possibly [sustain]{.mark}]{.underline} (Global Footprint
Network 2013). Peak oil is but the most prominent example of a more
general situation of looming resource scarcity (Klare, 2012), with high
oil prices having a debilitating effect on the oil-dependent economies
which are seemingly dependent on cheap oil to maintain historic rates of
growth (Heinberg, 2011). At the same time, [great multitudes around the
globe live lives of material destitution, representing a vast,
marginalised segment of humanity]{.underline} that justifiably seeks to
expand its economic capacities in some form (World Bank, 2008).
[[Biod]{.mark}iversity [continues to be]{.mark}
[devastated]{.mark}]{.underline} [by deforestation and]{.underline}
other forms of [habitat destruction]{.underline} (United Nations, 2010),
[while the global development agenda seems to be aiming to provide an
expanding global population]{.underline} with the [high-impact material
affluence]{.underline} enjoyed by the richest parts of the world
(Hamilton, 2003). This is [despite evidence crying out that the
universalisation of affluence is environmentally
unsupportable]{.underline} (Smith and Positano, 2010; Turner, 2012) and
not even a reliable path to happiness (Lane, 2001; Alexander, 2012a).
[[Most worrying]{.mark} of all]{.underline}, perhaps, [[is
the]{.underline}]{.mark} [increasingly [robust body of climate
science]{.mark} indicating the magnitude of the global
predicament]{.underline} (IPCC, 2013). According to the Climate Tracker
Initiative (2013: 4), [[the world could exceed its]{.mark} [\'carbon
budget\']{.mark} in]{.underline} around [18 years]{.underline},
essentially [[locking us into a future]{.underline}]{.mark} that is at
least 2 degrees warmer, and [[threatening]{.underline}]{.mark} us with
[[4 degrees]{.mark} or more]{.underline}. It is unclear to what extent
civilisation as we know it is compatible with runaway climate change.
And [still]{.underline}, almost without exception, [all
nations]{.underline} on the planet - including or especially the richest
ones - [continue to seek GDP growth without limit]{.underline}, [as if
the cause of these problems could somehow provide the
solution.]{.underline} [If]{.underline} [once it was hoped that
technology]{.underline} and science [were going to]{.underline} be able
[decouple economic activity from ecological impact]{.underline}, [such a
position is no longer credible]{.underline} (Huesemann and Huesemann,
2011). [[Technology]{.underline}]{.mark} simply [[cannot provide any
escape]{.underline}]{.mark} [[from]{.mark} the fact that there are
[biophysical limits to growth]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Despite]{.mark}
decades of extraordinary [technological advance]{.mark}, which it is was
promised would lighten the ecological burden of our
economies]{.underline}, [global [energy and resource consumption
continues to grow]{.mark}]{.underline}, exacerbated by a growing
population, but which is primarily a function of the growth-orientated
values that lie at the heart of global capitalism (Turner, 2012).

Against this admittedly gloomy backdrop lies a heterogeneous tradition
of critical theorists and activists promoting what could be called a
\'deep green\' alternative to the growth-orientated, industrial economy.
Ranging from the radical simplicity of Henry Thoreau (1983), to the
post-growth economics of the Club of Rome (Meadows et al, 1972; 2004),
and developing into contemporary expressions of radical reformism
(Latouche, 2009; Heinberg, 2011; Jackson, 2009), eco-socialism (Sarkar,
1999; Smith, 2010), and eco-anarchism (Bookchin, 1989; Holmgren, 2002;
Trainer; 2010a), this extremely diverse tradition nevertheless agrees
that [the nature of [the]{.mark} existing [system is]{.mark} [inherently
unsustainable.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Tinkering]{.mark} with or
softening its margins]{.underline} - that is, any attempt to give
capitalism a \'human face\' - [[is not going to]{.mark} come close to
[address]{.mark}ing [the problem]{.mark}s]{.underline} we, [the human
species, are confronted with]{.underline}. [What is needed]{.underline},
this tradition variously maintains, [is a radically alternative way of
living on the Earth]{.underline} - something \'wholly other\' to the
ways of industrialisation, consumerism, and limitless growth. However
idealistic or Utopian their arguments might seem, the basic reasoning is
that the nature of [any solutions to current problems must]{.underline}
honestly [confront the magnitude of the overlapping crises]{.underline},
[for else one risks serving the destructive forces one ostensibly
opposes]{.underline}.

I want to point out that a **[massive [discrepancy exists
between]{.mark} the official [pronouncements]{.mark} emerging from
Copenhagen [on carbon emissions and]{.mark} recent government [actions
to spur]{.mark} economic [growth]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Before and
during Copenhagen (and after, too, we can be sure), **[politicians and
central bankers across the globe have worked tirelessly to return the
global economy to a path of growth.]{.underline}** We need more jobs, we
are told; **[we need economic growth, we need more people consuming more
things]{.underline}**. **[[Growth is the ever-constant word]{.mark} on
politicians\' lips.]{.underline}** Official actions amounting to tens of
trillions of dollars speak to the fact that this is, in fact, our
number-one global priority. But **[the consensus coming out of
Copenhagen is that [carbon emissions have to be reduced]{.mark} by a
vast amount over the next few decades.]{.underline}** **[These two ideas
are mutually exclusive. [You can\'t have both]{.mark}. Economic [growth
requires energy, and most]{.mark} of our energy [comes from
hydrocarbons]{.mark}]{.underline}** - coal, oil, and natural gas.
**[Burning those fuel sources releases carbon. Therefore, [increasing
economic activity will release more carbon]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It is
a very simple concept. **[Nobody has yet articulated how it is that we
will reconcile both economic growth and reduced use of hydrocarbon
energy]{.underline}**. And so the proposed actions coming out of
Copenhagen are not grounded in reality, and they are set dead against
trillions of dollars of spending. **[[There is only one thing]{.mark}
that we know about [which has]{.mark} curbed, and even [reversed, the
flow]{.mark} of carbon into the atmosphere, and that is the recent
[economic contraction]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This is hard proof of the
connection between the economy and energy. It should serve as proof that
any desire to grow the economy is also an explicit call to increase the
amount of carbon being expelled into the atmosphere. **[[The idea of
salvation via the]{.mark} electric plug-in car or other [renewable
energy is a fantasy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The reality is that **[any
[new tech]{.mark}]{.underline}**nology **[[takes decades to reach full
market penetration]{.mark}, and we haven\'t even really begun to
introduce any yet]{.underline}**. **[Time, scale, and cost must be
weighed when considering any new
tech]{.underline}**nology**[\'s]{.underline}** **[potential to have a
significant impact on our energy-use patterns.]{.underline}** For
example, a recent study concluded that **[another 20 years would be
required for electric vehicles to have a significant impact on US
gas]{.underline}**oline **[consumption]{.underline}**. Meaningful
Numbers of Plug-In Hybrids Are Decades Away The mass-introduction of the
plug-in hybrid electric car is still a few decades away, according to
new analysis by the National Research Council. The study, released on
Monday, also found that the next generation of plug-in hybrids could
require hundreds of billions of dollars in government subsidies to take
off. Even then, plug-in hybrids would not have a significant impact on
the nation's oil consumption or carbon emissions before 2030. Savings in
oil imports would also be modest, according to the report, which was
financed with the help of the Energy Department. **[[Twenty to thirty
years is the normal length of time for any new
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology **[to scale up and fully penetrate a
large market]{.underline}**. But this study, as good as it was in
calculating the time, scale, and cost parameters of technology
innovation and penetration, still left out the issue of resource
scarcity. **[[Is there enough lithium]{.mark} in the world to build all
these cars? Neodymium? [This is a fourth issue]{.mark} that deserves
careful consideration, [given the scale of the]{.mark} overall
[issue]{.mark}.]{.underline}** But even if we did manage to build
hundreds of millions of plug-in vehicles, **[where would the electricity
come from?]{.underline}** Many people mistakenly think that we are well
on our way to substantially providing our electricity needs using
renewable sources such as wind and solar. We are not. Renewable
timetable is a long shot Al Gore\'s well-intentioned challenge that we
produce \"100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly
clean carbon-free sources within 10 years\" represents a widely held
delusion that we can\'t afford to harbor. The delusion is shared by the
Minnesota Legislature, which is requiring the state\'s largest utility,
Xcel Energy, to get at least 24 percent of its energy from wind by 2020.
**[One of the most frequently ignored energy issues is the time required
to bring forth a major new fuel to the world\'s energy
supply]{.underline}**. Until the mid-19th century, burning wood powered
the world. Then coal gradually surpassed wood into the first part of the
20th century. Oil was discovered in the 1860s, but it was a century
before it surpassed coal as our largest energy fuel. Trillions of
dollars are now invested in the world\'s infrastructure to mine, process
and deliver coal, oil and natural gas. As distinguished professor Vaclav
Smil of the University of Manitoba recently put it, \"It is delusional
to think that the United States can install in a decade wind and solar
generating capacity equivalent to that of thermal power plants that took
nearly 60 years to construct.\" Texas has three times the name plate
wind capacity of any other state --- 8,000-plus megawatts. The Electric
Reliability Council of Texas manages the Texas electric grids. ERCOT
reports that its unpredictable wind farms actually supply just a little
more than 700 MW during summer power demand, and provide just 1 percent
of Texas\' power needs of about 72,000 MW. ERCOT\'s 2015 forecast still
has wind at just more than 1 percent despite plans for many more
turbines. For the United States, the Energy Information Administration
is forecasting wind and solar together will supply less than 3 percent
of our electric energy in 2020. Again it turns out that **[[supplanting
even a fraction]{.mark} of our current electricity production with
renewables [will]{.mark}]{.underline}** also **[[take us
decades]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And **[even that presumes that we have a
functioning economy in which to mine, construct, transport and erect
these fancy new tech]{.underline}**nologies. **[Time, scale, and cost
all factor in as challenges to significant penetration of new energy
tech]{.underline}**nologies **[as well.]{.underline}** So **[[where will
all the new energy for]{.mark} economic [growth come from?]{.mark} The
answer]{.underline}**, unsurprisingly, **[is from the already-installed
carbon-chomping coal, oil, and natural gas infrastructure. That is the
implicit assumption that lies behind the calls for renewed economic
growth]{.underline}**. It\'s The Money, Stupid As noted here routinely
in my writings and in the Crash Course, we have an exponential monetary
system. **[[One mandatory feature of our current]{.mark} exponential
monetary [system is the need for]{.mark} perpetual growth. Not just any
kind of growth; [exponential growth]{.mark}]{.underline}**. That\'s the
price for paying interest on money loaned into existence. Without that
growth, our monetary system shudders to a halt and shifts into reverse,
operating especially poorly and threatening to melt down the entire
economic edifice. This is so well understood, explicitly or implicitly,
throughout all the layers of society and in our various institutions,
that you will only ever hear politicians and bankers talking about the
\"need\" for growth. In fact, they are correct; our system does need
growth. All debt-based money systems require growth. That is the
resulting feature of loaning one\'s money into existence. That\'s the
long and the short of the entire story. The growth may seem modest,
perhaps a few percent per year (\'That\'s all, honest!\'), but therein
lies the rub. **[Any continuous percentage growth is still exponential
growth]{.underline}**. Exponential growth means not just a little bit
more each year, but a constantly growing amount each year. It is a story
of more**[. Every year needs slightly more than the prior year - that\'s
the requirement.]{.underline}** The Gap **[Nobody has yet reconciled the
vast intellectual and practical gap that exists between our addiction to
exponential growth and the carbon reduction rhetoric coming out of
Copenhagen.]{.underline}** **[I\'ve yet to see any credible plan that
illustrates how we can grow our economy without using more
energy]{.underline}**. Is it somehow possible to grow an economy without
using more energy? Let\'s explore that concept for a bit. What does it
mean to \"grow an economy?\" Essentially, it means more jobs for more
people producing and consuming more things. That\'s it. An economy, as
we measure it, consists of delivering the needs and wants of people in
ever-larger quantities. It\'s those last three words - ever-larger
quantities - that defines the whole problem. For example, suppose our
economy consisted only of building houses. If the same number of houses
were produced each year, we\'d say that the economy was not growing. It
wouldn\'t matter whether the number was four hundred thousand or four
million; if the same number of new homes were produced each year, year
after year, this would be considered a very bad thing, because it would
mean our economy was not growing. The same is true for cars, hair
brushes, big-screen TVs, grape juice, and everything else you can think
of that makes up our current economy. Each year, more needs to be sold
than the year before, or the magic economic-stimulus wands will come out
to ward off the Evil Spirits of No Growth. If our economy were to grow
at the same rate as the population, it would grow by around 1% per year.
This is still exponential growth, but it is far short of the 3%-4% that
policymakers consider both desirable and necessary. Why the gap? Why do
we work so hard to ensure that 1% more people consume 3% more stuff each
year? Out of Service It\'s not that 3% is the right number for the land
or the people who live upon it. The target of 3% is driven by our
monetary system, which needs a certain rate of exponential growth each
year in order to cover the interest expense due each year on the already
outstanding loans. The needs of our monetary system are driving our
economic decisions, not the needs of the people, let alone the needs of
the planet. We are in service to our money system, not the other way
around. **[Today we have a burning need for an economic model that can
operate tolerably well without growth]{.underline}**. But ours can\'t,
and so we actually find ourselves in the uncomfortable position of
pitting human needs against the money system and observing that the
money system is winning the battle. The Federal Reserve exists solely to
assure that the monetary system has what it needs to function. That is
their focus, their role, and their primary concern. I assume that they
assume that by taking care of the monetary system, everything else will
take care of itself. I think their assumption is archaic and wrong.
Regardless, our primary institutions and governing systems are in
service to a monetary system that is dysfunctional. It was my having
this outlook, this lens, more than any other, that allowed me to foresee
what so many economists missed. **[Only by examining the system from a
new, and very wide, angle can the enormous flaws in the system be
seen.]{.underline}** Economy & Energy Now let\'s get back to our main
problem of economic growth and energy use (a.k.a. carbon production).
**[There is simply no way to build houses, produce televisions, grow and
transport grape juice, and market hair brushes without consuming energy
in the process. That\'s just a cold, hard reality]{.underline}**. **[We
need liquid fuel to extract, transform, and transport products to
market. More people living in more houses means we need more
electricity.]{.underline}** Sure, we can be more efficient in our use of
energy, but **[[unless our efficiency gains are exceeding the rate
of]{.mark} economic [growth, more energy will be used]{.mark}, not less.
In the long run, if we were being 3% more efficient in our use of fuel
and growing our economy at 3%, this would mean burning the same amount
of fuel each year.]{.underline}** Unfortunately, **[[fuel-efficiency
gains]{.mark} are well known to [run slower than]{.mark} economic
[growth]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For example, **[[the average fuel
efficiency]{.mark} of the US car fleet]{.underline}** (as measured by
the CAFE standards) **[[has increased by 18%]{.mark} over the past 25
years, [while the economy has grown by 331%.]{.mark} Naturally, our fuel
consumption has grown, not fallen, over that time, despite the
efficiency gains.]{.underline}** So the bottom line is this**[: There is
no possible way to both have economic growth]{.underline}** (as we\'ve
known it in the past) **[and cut carbon emissions.]{.underline}** At
least not without doing things very differently.

[[We are]{.mark} often [assured]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[innovation]{.mark} in the future [will reduce]{.mark} our society's
[dependence]{.mark} [on]{.mark} [energy]{.mark} and]{.underline} other
[resources while providing a lifestyle such as we now
enjoy]{.underline}. We discuss this point further in Chaps. 5 and 9.
Here we observe that [[rates of innovation]{.underline}]{.mark} appear
to [[change in a]{.mark} manner similar to the [Hubbert cycle]{.mark} of
resource production. This]{.underline} finding [has important
implications for the]{.underline} [future productivity and complexity of
our society]{.underline}. [Energy flows, technology
development]{.underline}, population growth, [and individual creativity
can be combined into an overall "Innovation Index]{.underline}" which is
the number of patents granted each year by the U.S. Patent Office per
one million inhabitants of the United States of America. This specific
patent rate has the units of the number of patents per year per one
million people. Figure 3.16 is a decomposition of this patent rate into
multiple Hubbert-like cycles between 1790 and 2009. Interestingly, [the
fundamental Hubbert cycle of the U.S. patent rate peaked in
1914]{.underline}, [the year in which World War I broke
out]{.underline}. [The second major rate peak was in 1971, coinciding
with the peak of U.S. oil production]{.underline}[. [The
last]{.underline}]{.mark} [and tallest [peak of productivity occurred
in]{.mark} [2004]{.mark}]{.underline}. Note that without a new cycle of
inventions in something, [[the current cycles will expire by
2050]{.underline}]{.mark}. In other words, [the]{.underline}
[[productivity of U.S. innovation]{.underline} [will
decline]{.underline}]{.mark} [[dramatically]{.mark} in the next 20--30
years]{.underline}, with some of this decline possibly being forced by a
steady decline of support for fundamental research and development.
Energy and Complexity [[Each new complex addition]{.mark} to
the]{.underline} [already overwhelmingly complex social and scientific

[[is]{.underline} [less and less relevant]{.underline}]{.mark},
[while]{.underline} [[costing additional]{.mark} [resources]{.mark} and
aggravation]{.underline}. Most of this complexity is apparent to the
naked eye: look at the global banking and trading system, the healthcare
system, the computer operating systems and software, military
operations, or government structures. The scope of the problem is also
obvious in the production pains of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, and in the
drilling of the BP Macondo well.

**[There is a]{.underline}**n overwhelmingly powerful, **[never
questioned, assumption that all these problems can and will be solved
by]{.underline}** moving to **[renewable energy]{.underline}** sources.
That is, it is generally believed that sources such as the sun and the
wind can replace fossil fuels, providing the quantities of energy that
consumer society will need, in the forms and at the times that they are
needed. Surprisingly, **[[almost no literature has explored whether this
is possible]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Unfortunately in the task of
assessing the validity of this dominant assumption we have not been
helped by the people who know most about the field, **[the [renewable
energy experts]{.mark}]{.underline}**. They **[[have a strong interest
in boosting the potential of their pet tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology
**[[and in not drawing attention to its weaknesses,]{.mark} difficulties

but it means that **[contributions by those most familiar with these

**Alternative**

**[2NC -- Alt -- Solvency Wall]{.underline}**

#### The alt solves best -- 

#### A. [Comfort]{.underline}: By standing back and refusing to engage in the genocidal ideology, we force a confrontation with the evil of participating in Capital.  This exposition of Capitalism's contradictions forces real change. Their call for action within the system has historically failed and sustained Capitalism, for example the Nazi Doctors excuse that they could minimize harm and the Democrats' rhetoric of lesser evil, which initiated a slippery slope until Johnson, the architect of Vietnam, was the lesser evil.  Their advocacy's merely a conscience easing exercise in futility. 

#### B. [Politics]{.underline}: The desire for pragmatic action forecloses electoral change because it produces choices in evil, which alienates the majority of the population.  A moral stance against Capitalism can mobilize the disenfranchised, whose votes their political analysis discounts as meaningless. 

#### C. [Try or Die]{.underline}: We have suffered through centuries of pragmatic action.  From the punishment after World War 1 to the assistance after World War 2 to the negotiations before Vietnam and Iraq.  Pragmatic actions have heralded a repetition of disaster.  As Einstein stated we must now change our ways of thinking, which permit genocide and exploitation in the name of profit or we'll go extinct. 

**The alt is both necessary and sufficient to dismantle the system from
bottom up**

social activist since 1968 Getting Free 2004
<http://site.www.umb.edu/faculty/salzman_g/Strate/GetFre/06.htm>

It is time to try to describe, at first abstractly and later concretely,
**[a [strategy for destroying capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This
strategy, at its most basic**[, [calls for]{.mark} pulling [time,
energy,]{.mark} [and resources out of capitalist civilization and
putting them into]{.mark} building [a new
civilization]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The image then is **[one of
[emptying out capitalist structures]{.mark}, hollowing them out, by
[draining]{.mark} wealth, power, and meaning out of [them unti]{.mark}l
[]{.mark}there is [nothing left]{.mark} but shells]{.underline}**. This
is definitely **[an aggressive strategy]{.underline}**. It **[requires
great militancy, and constitutes an attack on the existing
order.]{.underline}** **[The [strategy]{.mark} clearly
[recognizes]{.mark} that [capitalism is the enemy and must be
destroyed,]{.mark}]{.underline}** but it is **[not a frontal attack
aimed at overthrowing the system, but [an inside attack aimed at gutting
it]{.mark}]{.underline}**, while simultaneously replacing it with
something better, something we want. Thus **[capitalist
structures]{.underline}** (corporations, governments, banks, schools,
etc.) **[are not seized so much as simply abandoned. Capitalist
relations are not fought so much as they are simply
rejected]{.underline}**. We **[stop participating in activities that
support]{.underline}** (finance, condone) **[the capitalist world and
start participating in activities that build a new world while
simultaneously undermining the old. We create a new pattern of social
relations alongside capitalist relations and then we continually build
and strengthen our new pattern while doing every thing we can to weaken
capitalist relations.]{.underline}** In this way **[our new [democratic,
non-hierarchical, non-commodified relations can]{.mark} eventually
[overwhelm]{.mark} the [capitalist relations]{.mark} and force them out
of existence]{.underline}**. This is how it has to be done. **[[This is
a]{.mark} plausible[, realistic
strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[To think that we could
create a whole new world of decent social arrangements
overnight]{.underline}**, in the midst of a crisis, during a so-called
revolution, or during the collapse of capitalism**[, is
foolhardy]{.underline}**. **[Our new social world must grow within the
old, and in opposition to it, until it is strong enough to dismantle and
abolish capitalist relations]{.underline}**. Such a **[revolution will
never happen automatically,]{.underline}** blindly, determinably,
because of the inexorable, materialist laws of history. **[It will
happen, and only happen, because we want it to, and because we know what
we're doing and know how we want to live, and know what obstacles have
to be overcome before we can live that way, and know how to distinguish
between our social patterns and theirs.]{.underline}** But we must not
think that the capitalist world can simply be ignored, in a live and let
live attitude, while we try to build new lives elsewhere. (There is no
elsewhere.) There is at least one thing, wage-slavery, that we can't
imply stop participating in (but even here there are ways we can chip
away at it). **[[Capitalism must be]{.mark} explicitly [refused
and]{.mark} replaced by something else. This constitutes War, but it is
not a war in the traditional sense of armies and tanks, but a war fought
on a daily basis, on the level of everyday life]{.underline}**, by
millions of people. **[[It is]{.mark} a [war]{.mark} nevertheless
[because]{.mark} the [accumulators of capital will use]{.mark}
coercion[, brutality, and murder,]{.mark} as they have always done in
the past, [to]{.mark} try to block [any rejection of the system. They
have]{.mark} always [had to force compliance; they will not hesitate to
continue]{.mark} doing so.]{.underline}** Nevertheless, **[there
are]{.underline}** many **[concrete ways that]{.underline}**
individuals, groups, and neighborhoods can **[gut
capitalism]{.underline}**, which I will enumerate shortly. We must
always **[keep in mind how we became slaves; then we can see more
clearly how we can cease being slaves]{.underline}**. We were forced
into wage-slavery because the ruling class slowly, systematically, and
brutally destroyed our ability to live autonomously. **[By driving us
off the land, changing the property laws, destroying community rights,
destroying our tools, imposing taxes, destroying our local
markets]{.underline}**, and so forth, we were **[forced onto the labor
market in order to survive]{.underline}**, our only remaining option
being to sell, for a wage, our ability to work. It's quite clear then
how **[we can overthrow slavery. We must reverse this process. We must
begin to reacquire the ability to live without working for a wage or
buying the products made by wage-slaves]{.underline}** (that is, we must
get free from the labor market and the way of living based on it),
**[and embed ourselves instead in cooperative labor]{.underline}** and
cooperatively produced goods. Another clarification is needed. **[This
strategy does not call for reforming capitalism, for changing capitalism
into something else. It calls for replacing capitalism,
totally]{.underline}**, with a new civilization. This is an important
distinction, because **[[capitalism has proved impervious to
reforms]{.mark}, as a system]{.underline}**. We can sometimes in some
places win certain concessions from it (usually only temporary ones) and
win some (usually short-lived) improvements in our lives as its victims,
but **[[we cannot reform]{.mark} it [piecemeal, as a
system]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} Thus **[our [strategy]{.mark} of
gutting and eventually destroying capitalism [requires]{.mark} at a
minimum [a totalizing image]{.mark}, an awareness that we are attacking
an entire way of life and replacing it with another, and not merely
reforming one way of life into something else.]{.underline}** Many
people may not be accustomed to thinking about entire systems and social
orders, but everyone knows what a lifestyle is, or a way of life, and
that is the way we should approach it. The thing is this: **[in order
for capitalism to be destroyed]{.underline}** millions and millions of
**[people must be dissatisfied with their way of life. They must want
something else and see certain existing things as obstacles to getting
what they want]{.underline}**. It is not useful to think of this as a
new ideology. It is not merely a belief-system that is needed, like a
religion, or like Marxism, or Anarchism. Rather **[it is a new
prevailing vision, a dominant desire]{.underline}**, an overriding need.
**[What must exist is a pressing desire to live a certain
way]{.underline}**, and not to live another way. If this pressing desire
were a desire to live free, to be autonomous, to live in democratically
controlled communities, to participate in the self-regulating activities
of a mature people, then capitalism could be destroyed[. **[Otherwise we
are doomed]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[to perpetual slavery and possibly
even [to extinction]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The content of this vision
is actually not new at all, but quite old. **[The long term
goa]{.underline}**l of communists, anarchists, and socialists **[has
always been to restore community]{.underline}**. Even the great peasant
revolts of early capitalism sought to get free from external authorities
and restore autonomy to villages. Marx defined communism once as a free
association of producers, and at another time as a situation in which
the **[free development of each is a condition for the free development
of all]{.underline}**. Anarchists have always called for worker and
peasant self-managed cooperatives. **[The long term goals have always
been clear]{.underline}**: to abolish wage-slavery, **[to eradicate a
social order organized solely around the accumulation of capital for its
own sake, and to establish in its place a society of free people who
democratically and cooperatively self-determine the shape of their
social world]{.underline}**.

#### As an intellectual your rejection of capitalism has emancipatory results - criticism allows capitalism to be challenged

**Kovel 2** (Joel, Professor of Social Studies at Bard, The Enemy of
Nature, p224)

[[Relentless criticism can **delegitimate** the system]{.underline} [and
**release** people]{.underline}]{.mark} [into struggle]{.underline}. And
as struggle develops, victories that are no more than incremental by
their own terms- stopping a meeting stopping the IMF, the
[[hopes]{.underline}]{.mark} stirred forth by a campaign such as Ralph
Nader's in 2000 -- [can [have a **symbolic effect** **far greater** than
their **external result**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and constitute points
of rupture with capital]{.underline}. [[This rupture is not a set of
facts added to our knowledge of the world, but a **change in our
relation** to the world]{.underline}. [Its effects]{.underline}]{.mark}
are dynamic, not incremental, and like all genuine insights it changes
the balance of forces and [can [propagate]{.mark}]{.underline} very
[[swiftly]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thus the release from [[inertia can
trigger a **rapid cascade of changes**]{.mark}, so]{.underline} that it
could be said that the forces pressing towards radical [[change need not
be]{.underline}]{.mark} linear and [[incremental, but]{.underline} can
be **[exponential]{.underline}**]{.mark} in character. In this way,
conscientious and [[radical criticism]{.mark}]{.underline} of the given,
even in advance of having blueprints for an alternative, [[can be a
material force, because it can seize the mind of the masses of people.
**There is no greater responsibility for
intellectuals**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

**[A2: Transition Wars]{.underline}**

**No transition wars -- there aren't any resources**

**Bennett and Nordstrom '00** (D. Scott, Timothy, Department of
Political Science, Pennsylvania State University, "Foreign Policy
Substitutability and Internal Economic Problems in Enduring Rivalries,"
The Journal of Conflict Resolution, Vol. 44, No. 1, Feb., pp. 33-61,
JSTOR)

This leads to our first hypothesis, which is as follows: Hypothesis 1:
[Poor economic conditions lead to]{.underline} diversionary actions
against the rival. [Conflict settlement]{.underline} is also a distinct
route to dealing with internal problems that leaders in rivalries may
pursue when faced with internal problems. [Military
competition]{.underline} between states [requires large amounts of
resources]{.underline}, and rivals require even more attention.
[[Leaders may]{.underline}]{.mark} choose to [[negotiate a
settlement]{.underline}]{.mark} that ends a rivalry [[to free up
important resources that may be reallocated to the domestic
economy]{.underline}]{.mark}. [In a \"guns versus butter\" world of
economic trade-offs, when a state can no longer afford to pay the
expenses associated with competition in a rivalry, [it is quite rational
for leaders to reduce costs by ending a
rivalry]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} This gain (a peace dividend)
could be achieved at any time by ending a rivalry. However, such a gain
is likely to be most important and attractive to leaders when internal
conditions are bad and the leader is seeking ways to alleviate active
problems. Support for policy change away from continued rivalry is more
likely to develop when the economic situation sours and elites and
masses are looking for ways to improve a worsening situation. It is at
these times that the [[pressure to cut military investment will be
greatest and that state leaders will be forced to recognize the
difficulty of continuing to pay for a rivalry]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Among other things, this argument also encompasses the view that the
cold war ended because the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics could no
longer compete economically with the United States.

**Their evidence relies on flawed models -- economic collapse forces
countries to focus inward -- solves risk of conflict**

Substitutability and Internal Economic Problems in Enduring Rivalries,"

[[Most]{.underline}]{.mark} scholarly [[works that examine the effects
of domestic economic woes on international behavior have focused
on]{.underline}]{.mark} the theoretical possibility that leaders
undertake [[adventurous foreign policies]{.underline}]{.mark} under
conditions of worsening economic, social, and political problems (Levy
1989). Commonly known as either externalization or diversion, the main
thrust of the argument is that political elites can solidify their
relationship with their domestic constituents by transferring the
public\'s attention from economic issues to the foreign enemy.
Underlying the process is the assumption that the military action will
cause the citizens to \"rally \'round the flag\" (Mueller 1973) and
thereby the patriotic mass will see political elites in a more positive
light. Early studies attributed to his rallying effect to a suspected
in-group/out-group relationship. Simmel (1955) argued that an
altercation with an out-group (the target of the externalization
efforts) helps promote cohesion within the in-group (the troubled
leader\'s citizenry) because it is natural for individuals to pull
together with those they know when confronted by outsiders. Transferring
the argument to action, it may be that if political elites realize that
this in-group/out-group dynamic exists, then they will make advantageous
use of externalization tactics. Auxiliary arguments might suggest that
leaders will prefer short, manageable conflicts to boost their support
without risking the long term costs of war. An additional implication of
the theory when applied strategically to pairs of conflictual states is
that while states with problems are likely to be conflict initiators,
states without such problems are more likely to be the targets of
diversion. If diversionary logic holds and states want to initiate a
cheap and manageable incident to divert attention without imposing major
costs, then leaders would prefer to initiate against states in a good
economic or domestic situation. If the target is in bad shape
domestically, then leaders in that target may have their own incentives
to escalate the conflict to divert public attention. Initiators thinking
strategically may try to avoid conflict against such an opponent. While
diversionary conflict theory has been the subject of much scholarly
attention, the evidence supporting the argument has been mixed. On one
hand, studies that take the historical case study approach tend to
support the notion that leaders do externalize when faced with domestic
problems (Levy 1988, 667); in a related body of work, some case studies
of deterrence failures have shown that these cases are often
characterized by an attacker who is motivated by internal problems
(e.g., Jervis, Lebow, and Stein 1985). On the other hand, [[quantitative
studies of externalization have not provided consistent
support]{.mark}.]{.underline} Across studies of externalization in
general (e.g., Leeds and Davis 1997) or in the context of specific
states\' foreign policies (Fordham 1998; Gowa 1998; Meernik 1994;
Meernik and Waterman 1996; Ostrom and Job 1986; Morgan and Bickers 1992;
Mintz and Russett 1992), findings about whether quantitative data
support the theory have been mixed. The nature of the results has led
some to question the validity of the theories. For example, Bruce Bueno
de Mesquita (1985) posits that the logical flaw in externalization
theory lies in the psychological nature of the original scapegoat
hypothesis on which externalization theory is based. While the
international relations version of this theory is indeed written in
psychological terms (in-group/out-group), it may be that \"[[the logical
foundation for the leap from individual psychology to national action
remains non-existent]{.mark}\"]{.underline} (1985, 130). Similarly, Levy
(1989, 266) puts forth four problems with the original causal process as
described by Simmel (1955), Coser (1956), and other early writers on
externalization(:1 ) little attention is paid to the direction of the
relationship between internal problems and external conflict, (2)
attempts to develop or test alternative theoretical relationships are
rare,( 3) precise specifications of when externalization should occur
theoretically are rare, and (4) the conditions under which
externalization conditions should hold are unexplored. The conclusion
that Levy draws from these theoretical issues is that many of [[the
empirical studies suffer from problems of misspecified
models]{.underline}]{.mark} (1989, 267). An additional possible source
of discrepancies in findings about diversionary conflict may be
attributable to differences in research design and variable measurement.
Studies have used a variety of research designs, different dependent
variables (uses of force, major uses of force, militarized disputes),
different estimation techniques, and different data sets covering
different time periods and different states. Even the central concept of
externalization, namely, domestic trouble, is unclear. Most studies to
date have used presidential popularity, overall presidential success,
the election calendar, or a misery index composed of inflation and
unemployment as indicators of presidential problems. Cross-national
studies have most frequently examined what James (1988, 103) categorizes
as manifest conflict, a category which includes protest demon strations,
political strikes, armed attacks, and deaths from domestic violence.
This category can be opposed to latent conflict, which exists when
sources of trouble are present but have not yet led to the physical
manifestations of dissatisfaction. [Diversionary conflict
theory]{.underline} as presented is typically so general in its
discussion of internal problems that it [opens a Pandora\'s box of
possible indicators of domestic conflict,]{.underline} and all of the
types of measures discussed above fit with the theory. [The vague nature
of the theory may be contributing to this possible problem of model
misspecification]{.underline}, but there are few arguments that suggest
one indicator is superior to the others. Alternative relationships
between domestic economic performance and international conflict also
have been proposed, perhaps most importantly by Blainey (1973, 74).
Blainey offers the alternative hypothesis about economics and war that
economically challenged countries are more likely to be the target of
aggressive military acts than their initiator (1973, 86). Faced with a
poor target in a bad economic situation, who is faced with an unhappy
populace and possibly limited resources, potential conflict initiators
are likely to see opportunity. The argument also parallels the
historical notion that leaders would only go to war when their coffers
were full-in bad times, leaders may simply not be able to afford to go
to conflict. Blainey\'s argument appears to pose a challenge to
diversionary conflict theory in its emphasis on what is the most likely
direction of conflict. Note, however, that its prediction (weak states
become targets) differs from a strategic application of diversionary
conflict theory. By coming at externalization from the substitutability
perspective, we hope to deal with some of the theoretical problems
raised by critics of diversionary conflict theory. Substitutability can
be seen as a particular problem of model specification where the
dependent variable has not been fully developed. We believe that one of
the theoretical problems with studies of externalization has been a lack
of attention to alternative choices; Bueno de Mesquita actually hints
toward this (and the importance of foreign policy substitution) when he
argues that [[it is **shortsighted** to conclude that a leader will
uniformly externalize in response to domestic problems at the expense of
other possible policy choice]{.mark}s]{.underline} (1985, 130). We hope
to improve on the study of externalization and behavior within rivalries
by considering multiple outcomes in response to domestic conditions.5 In
particular, we will focus on the alternative option that instead of
externalizing, leaders may internalize [when faced with domestic
economic troubles]{.underline}. [Rather than diverting the attention of
the public or relevant elites through military action, leaders may
actually work to solve their internal problems internally]{.underline}.
Tying internal solutions to the external environment, we focus on the
possibility that leaders may work to disengage their country from
hostile relationships in the international arena to deal with domestic
issues. Domestic problems often emerge from the challenges of spreading
finite resources across many different issue areas in a manner that
satisfies the public and solves real problems. [[Turning inward for some
time may]{.mark} [free up resources required to jump-start the domestic
economy or may simply provide leaders the time to solve internal
distributional issues]{.mark}.]{.underline} In our study, we will focus
on the condition of the domestic economy (gross domestic product \[GDP\]
per capita growth) as a source of pressure on leaders to externalize. We
do this for a number of reasons. First, when studying rivalries, we need
an indicator of potential domestic trouble that is applicable beyond
just the United States or just advanced industrialized democracies. In
many non-Western states, variables such as election cycles and
presidential popularity are irrelevant. Economics are important to all
countries at all times. At a purely practical level, GDP data is also
more widely available (cross-nationally and historically) than is data
on inflation or unemployment. 6 Second, we believe that fundamental
economic conditions are a source of potential political problems to
which leaders must pay attention. Slowing growth or worsening economic
conditions may lead to mass dissatisfaction and protests down the road;
economic problems may best be dealt with at an early stage before they
turn into outward, potentially violent, conflict. This leads us to a
third argument, which is that we in fact believe that it may be more
appropriate in general to use indicators of latent conflict rather than
manifest conflict as indicators of the potential to divert. Once the
citizens of a country are so distressed that they resort to manifest
conflict (rioting or engaging in open protest), it may be too late for a
leader to satisfy them by engaging in distracting foreign policy
actions. If indeed leaders do attempt to distract people\'s attention,
then if protest reaches a high level, that attempt has actually failed
and we are looking for correlations between failed externalization
attempts and further diversion.

capitalism inevitably collapses\-\--it's try or die for embracing

the plan**

[The alternative to a failure of]{.underline} utilizing this crisis for
[a renewal of capitalism and hegemony]{.underline} [appears to
be]{.underline} [an increasing slide into some form of
barbarism]{.underline}. Again, [barbarism should also be understood as a
cipher]{.underline}, [inasmuch as it means an]{.underline} [acceleration
of trends already present within neoliberal capitalism]{.underline}.
[This includes]{.underline} the rise of [authoritarian]{.underline}
forms of [rule as well as]{.underline} the [forceful management of the
growing contradictions of global capitalism through]{.underline} [new
imperial endeavours,]{.underline} [motivated]{.underline} both
[by]{.underline} [geo-economic and geopolitical considerations and the
likely growth of]{.underline} '[blowbacks' and neoliberal
'boomerangs']{.underline} from the global South. In other words,
[this]{.underline} development [should be understood as a radicalization
of the 'new imperialism']{.underline} that emerged precisely [in
response to the crises produced by neoliberalism]{.underline} and
[particularly]{.underline} [the attempt of the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [to]{.underline} [use force as a means to avoid or
deter hegemonic decline]{.underline}. The [strengthening of elements of
authoritarian capitalism would suggest]{.underline} [growing
inter-imperial rivalries]{.underline}, [especially between the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and China]{.underline} but
possibly also between the United States and a German-led European Union.
[This scenario would]{.underline} also [involve]{.underline} a potential
[fragmentation of the world market]{.underline} (e.g. through
protectionism against German exports in the European Union, and possibly
also in the United States, and against Chinese exports, especially in
the United States but potentially also in Europe), a [growing
geoeconomic conflict]{.underline} [over the world's
resources]{.underline}, particularly fossil fuels, [and]{.underline} the
necessary [internal authoritarianism]{.underline} to complement and
reinforce such inter-imperial rivalries. [Nonetheless, this historic
moment is open]{.underline}, [and a third alternative does
exist]{.underline}. This can be seen partly in the emergence of the BRIC
states (Brazil, Russia, India, China) and their attempts at developing
not only growing economic, political and ideological independence from
the global North but also social and political alternatives to the
status quo. At the same time, these semi-peripheral big players are in
ideological struggles with, for example, those states of [the Latin
American ALBA coalition]{.underline} (the Bolivarian Alliance for the
People of Our America), which includes Venezuela and Bolivia, that
[seems to be moving]{.underline} more or less [in the direction of an
alternative to capitalism,]{.underline} or what it calls
'twenty-first-century socialism' -- a move that is complemented by new
regional military alliance structures. Similarly, also [in the global
North, the crisis of neoliberal hegemony has led not only to a vacuum
filled by right-wing populist parties but]{.underline}, in some cases,
most notably in Germany, [the rise of political forces
that]{.underline}, at least nominally, [strive to replace capitalism
with democratic socialism, understood as an economic system based
on]{.underline} [different forms of collective ownership]{.underline}.
It is clear that the German situation is an exception throughout the
(leading states of the) global North. All the same, it does mean that
[alternative political projects exist that]{.underline} [challenge green
capitalist 'alternatives' to neoliberal capitalism]{.underline}. Of
course, [it might be]{.underline} [exactly the emergence and growing
strength of such projects]{.underline}, alongside a noticeable new
militancy within labour movements across Europe, [that]{.underline}
[fuels the reestablishment of a new form of capitalist
hegemony]{.underline} [under a]{.underline} [green capitalist
order]{.underline}. At the same time, the differences between green
capitalism and authoritarian capitalism must under no circumstances be
downplayed, since, as Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels noted in a clear
non-teleological moment in probably their most historico-philosophical
text, the Manifesto of the Communist Party, the history of class
struggle may also end with the 'common demise of the struggling classes'
(Marx and Engels 1974 \[1848\]).

(Massimo, "The tragedy of the capitalist commons", December,
<http://turbulence.org.uk/turbulence-5/capitalist-commons/>, DOA:
7-2-12)

[This]{.underline} platform of [management of]{.underline} the global
[commons is based on one key assumption: that capitalist disciplinary
markets are a force for good, if only states are able to guide them onto
a path of environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive
growth]{.underline}. What this view forgets is that there is little
evidence that global economic growth could be achieved with lower
greenhouse gas emissions, in spite of increasingly energy-efficient new
technologies, which in turn implies that alternatives might just be
necessary to stop climate change. This raises the question of how we
disentangle ourselves from the kind of conception of commons offered by
Stiglitz, which allow solutions based on capitalist growth. COMMON
INTERESTS? [Commons also refer to common interests.]{.underline} To stay
with the example of climate change, if there is any chance of
significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions -- without this implying
some form of green authoritarianism -- it is because there is a common
interest in doing so. [But [common interests]{.mark} do not exist per
se, they [have to be constructed]{.mark}, a process that has
historically proven to be riddled with difficulties --]{.underline}
witness the feminist movement's attempts to construct a 'global
sisterhood'; or the workers' movement's project of a 'global
proletariat'. **[This is partly the case because [capitalism
stratifies]{.mark} 'women', 'workers' or [any]{.mark} other [collective
subject]{.mark} in and [through hierarchies]{.mark} of wages and
power]{.underline}**. And therein lies the rub, because [it is on the
terrain of the construction of common global interests (not just around
ecological issues, but also intellectual commons, energy commons, etc.)
that the class struggle of the 21st century will be played
out]{.underline}. This is where the centre of gravity of a new politics
will lie. There are thus two possibilities. [Either: social movements
will face up to the challenge and re-found the commons on values of
social justice]{.underline} in spite of, and beyond, these capitalist
hierarchies. **[Or: [capital will seize the historical moment to use
them to initiate a new round of accumulation]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(i.e. growth). The previous discussion of Stiglitz's arguments
highlights the dangers here. Because Stiglitz moves swiftly from the
presumed tragedy of the global commons to the need to preserve and
sustain them for the purpose of economic growth. Similar arguments can
be found in UN and World Bank reports on 'sustainable development', that
oxymoron invented to couple environmental and 'social' sustainability to
economic growth. [**[Sustainable development is simply the
sustainability of capital]{.mark}**. **This approach [asserts capitalist
growth as the sine qua non common interest of
humanity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I call [[commons]{.underline}]{.mark}
that [[are]{.underline} [tied to capitalist growth]{.underline}]{.mark}
[distorted commons,]{.underline} **[[where capital has successfully
subordinated non-monetary values to its primary goal of
accumulation.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The reason why common interests
cannot simply be postulated is that we do not reproduce our livelihoods
by way of postulations -- we cannot eat them, in short. [By and large,
we reproduce our livelihoods by entering into relations with others, and
by following the rules of these relations.]{.underline} To the extent
that the rules that we follow in reproducing ourselves are the rules of
capitalist production -- i.e. to the extent that our reproduction
depends on money -- [[we should question the operational value of any
postulation of a common interest, **because capitalist social relations
imply precisely the existence of injustices, and conflicts of
interest**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [These exist, on the one hand, between
those who produce value, and those who expropriate it; and, on the
other, between different layers of the planetary hierarchy. And, it is
not only pro-growth discourses that advocate the distorted commons that
perpetuate these conflicts at the same time as they try to negate them.
The same is true of environmental discourses that do not challenge the
existing social relations of production through which we reproduce our
livelihoods]{.underline}. Given that these assertions are somewhat
abstract, let us try to substantiate them by testing a central
environmental postulate on subjects who depend on capitalist markets for
the reproduction of their livelihoods.

**Perm fails\-\--It is impossible to evaluate the subjective agent

apparatuses, fanatical crowds? **[Doesn't [it desperately]{.mark} try to
[distract our attention from the true locus of trouble, by obliterating
from view other forms of violence and]{.mark} thus [actively

anecdote, a German officer visited Picasso in his Paris studio during
the Second World War. There he saw Guernica and, shocked at the
modernist "chaos" of the painting, asked Picasso: "Did you do this?"
Picasso calmly replied: "No, you did this!" Today, **[many a liberal,

We live in a society where a kind of Hegelian speculative identity of
opposites exists. [**[Certain features, attitudes, and norms of life are
no longer perceived as ideologically marked]{.underline}**.]{.mark}
**[[They appear to be neutral, non- ideological, natural,

would be [that **[it is precisely the neutralisation of some features

purest and at its most effective]{.underline}**]{.mark}. This is the
dialectical \"coincidence of opposites\": the actualisation of a notion
or an ideology at its purest coincides with, or, more precisely, appears
as its opposite, as non- ideology. Mutatis mutandis, the same holds for
violence. **[Social-symbolic violence at its purest appears as its

While the parallel holds, the concluding characterisation seems to fall
short: **[the unsettling message]{.underline}** of *Seeing* **[is
not]{.underline}** so much **[the indissolubility of both people and
government as much the compulsive nature of democratic rituals of
freedom.]{.underline}** What happens is that **[[by abstaining from
voting]{.mark}, [people]{.mark} effectively [dissolve the government-not
only in the limited sense of overthrowing the existing government, but
more radically]{.mark}. Why is the government thrown into such a panic
by the voters\' abstention? [It is compelled to confront the fact that
it exists, that it exerts power, only insofar as it is accepted as such
by its subjects]{.mark}-accepted even in the mode of rejection. [The
voters\' abstention goes further than the intra-political
negation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the vote of no confidence: **[[it
rejects the very frame of decision]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In
psychoanalytic terms, the voters\' abstention is something like the
psychotic *Verwerfung* (foreclosure, rejection/repudiation), which is a
more radical move than repression *(Verdrangung).* According to Freud,
**[the repressed is intellectually accepted by the subject, since it is
named, and at the same time is negated because the subject refuses to
recognise it, refuses to recognise him or herself in it]{.underline}**.
In contrast to this, foreclosure rejects the term from the symbolic
*tout court.* To circumscribe the contours of this radical rejection,
one is tempted to evoke Badiou\'s provocative thesis: \"It is better to
do nothing than to contribute to the invention of formal ways of
rendering visible that which Empire already recognizes as existent.\'\'6
**[[Better to do nothing than to]{.underline}]{.mark}** engage in
localised acts the ultimate function of which is to **[[make the system
run more smoothly]{.mark} (acts such as providing space for the
multitude of new subjectivities). [The threat today is not
passivity]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} pseudoactivity, [the urge to \"be
active]{.mark},\" [to \"participate,\" to mask the nothingness of what
goes on]{.mark}. [People intervene all the time, \"do
something]{.mark}]{.underline}**[\";]{.mark} academics participate in
meaningless debates, and so on. **[[The truly difficult thing is to step
back, to withdraw]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Those in power often prefer
even a \"critical\" participation, a dialogue, to silence-just to engage
us in \"dialogue,\" to make sure our ominous passivity is broken.
**[[The voters\' abstention is]{.mark} thus [a true political act: it
forcefully confronts us with the vacuity of today\'s
democracies.]{.mark} If one means by violence a radical upheaval of the
basic social relations, then, crazy and tasteless as it may sound, [the
problem with historical monsters who slaughtered millions was that they
were not violent enough]{.mark}. [Sometimes doing nothing is the most
violent thing to do.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

# **Case**

### DA Turns Case: War Causes Patriarchy 

#### Gender oppression does not cause war, it's the other way around

**Goldstein 2001 (Joshua, Int'l Rel Prof @ American U, 2001, War and
Gender, p. 412)**

First[, peace activists face a dilemma in thinking about causes of war
and working for peace. Many peace scholars and activists support the
approach, "if you want peace, work for justice." Then, [if **one
believes that sexism contributes to war one can work for gender justice
specifically**]{.mark} **(perhaps among others) [in order to pursue
peace]{.mark}**[. This approach]{.mark}]{.underline} brings strategic
allies to the peace movement (women, labor, minorities), but [[**rests
on the assumption that injustices cause war.** The
evidence]{.underline}]{.mark} in this book **[[suggests that causality
runs at least as strongly the other way. War is not a product of
capitalism, imperialism, gender, innate aggression, or any other single
caus]{.mark}e,]{.underline}** although all of these influence wars'
outbreaks and outcomes. **[[Rather, war has in part fueled and sustained
these and other injustices.9 So,"if you want peace, work for peace."
Indeed, if you want justice]{.underline}]{.mark}** (gender and others),
[**[work for peace]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Causality does not run just
upward through the levels of analysis, from types of individuals,
societies, and governments up to war. It runs downward too. Enloe
suggests [that [cha**nges in attitudes towards war and the military may
be the most important way to "reverse women's
oppression**.]{.underline}"]{.mark} The dilemma is that peace work
focused on justice brings to the peace movement energy, allies, and
moral grounding, yet, in light of this book's evidence, the emphasis on
injustice as the main cause of war seems to be empirically inadequate.
\"men of Africa\" as a group?) **[are seen as a group]{.underline}**
precisely **[because they are]{.underline}** generally **[dependent and
oppressed, the analysis of specific historical differences becomes
impossible, because reality is always apparently structured by
divisions]{.underline}**---two mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive
groups, the victims and the oppressors. Here **[the sociological is
substituted for the biological]{.underline}** in order, however, **[to
create]{.underline}** the same---**[a unity of women]{.underline}**.
Thus**[, it is]{.underline}** not the descriptive potential of gender
difference, but th**[e privileged positioning and explanatory potential
of gender difference as the origin of oppression that I
question]{.underline}**. In using \"women of Africa\" (as an already
constituted group of oppressed peoples) as a category of analysis,
Cutrufelli denies any historical specificity to the location of women as
subordinate, powerful, marginai, central, or otherwise, vis-a-vis
particular social and power networks. **[Women are taken as a unified
\"Powerless\" group prior to the analysis in question. Thus, it is then
merely a matter of specifying the context after the fact]{.underline}**.
\"Women\" are now placed in the context of the famiiy, or in the
workplace, or within religious networks, almost as if these systems
existed outside the relations of women with other women, and women with
men. **[The problem with this analytic strategy is that it assumes men
and women are already constituted as sexual-political subjects prior to
their entry into the arena of social relations]{.underline}**. Only if
we subscribe to this assumption is it possible to undertake analysis
which looks at the \"effects\" of kinship structures, colonialism,
organization of labor, etc., on women, who are already defined as a
group apparently because of shared dependencies, but ultimately because
of their gender. But women are produced through these very relations as
well as being implicated in forming these relations. As Michelle Rosaldo
states: \" . . . **[woman\'s place in human social life is not in any
direct sense a product of the things she does]{.underline}** (or even
less, a function of what, biologically, she is) **[but the meaning her
activities acquire through concrete social
interactions]{.underline}**.\"\" **[That women mother in a variety of
societies is not as significant as the value attached to mothering in
these societies]{.underline}**. The distinction between the act of
mothering and the status attached to it is a very important one---one
that needs to be made and analyzed contextually.

### Case Take-outs: Patriarchy Not Root Cause of Conflict

#### Patriarchy isn't the root cause of violence\--war is caused by proximate factors not root causes:

Brian **Martin, 1990** (professor of science, technology, and society --
University of Wollongong) Uprooting War. 1990. Accessed June 1, 2012 at
http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/90uw/uw13.html

In this chapter and in the six preceding chapters [[I have examined a
number of structures and factors which have some connection with the war
system.]{.underline}]{.mark} There is much more that could be said about
any one of these structures, and other factors which could be examined.
[[Here I wish to note one important point: attention should **not be
focused on one single factor** to the exclusion of others. This is often
done]{.underline}]{.mark} for example by some Marxists who look only at
capitalism as a root of war and other social problems, and [[by some
feminists who attribute most problems to patriarchy. **The danger of
monocausal explanations** is that they may lead to an inadequate
political practice.]{.underline}]{.mark} The \'revolution\' may be
followed by the persistence or even expansion of many problems which
were not addressed by the single-factor perspective. The one connecting
feature which I perceive in the structures underlying war is an unequal
distribution of power. This unequal distribution is socially organised
in many different ways, such as in the large-scale structures for state
administration, in capitalist ownership, in male domination within
families and elsewhere, in control over knowledge by experts, and in the
use of force by the military. Furthermore, these different systems of
power are interconnected. They often support each other, and sometimes
conflict. [[This means that the struggle against war can and must be
undertaken at many different levels]{.underline}.]{.mark} It ranges from
struggles to undermine state power to struggles to undermine racism,
sexism and other forms of domination at the level of the individual and
the local community. [[Furthermore, the different struggles need to be
linked together.]{.underline}]{.mark} That is the motivation for
analysing the roots of war and developing strategies for grassroots
movements to uproot them.

#### Claiming patriarchy is the root cause reinscribes the white, gendered subject---This turns the critique and increases the risk of violence against non-white men

**Thobani 7 (Sunera Thobani, Women's studies at the University of
British Columbia, "White wars: Western feminisms and the \`War on
Terror\'," Feminist Theory (2007) 8: 169)**

In the absence of a critique of the racially exclusionary forms of
feminisms (including radical feminisms) that can be found in the US,
Eisenstein returns to the familiar terrain of white feminists claiming
their own experience as gender victims to present themselves as the
natural gender allies of women in the third world. Although Eisenstein
does not re-centre the white imperial subject in quite the manner of
Chesler or Butler, she does not fully de-centre it either. Rather, she
allows for the feminized imperial subject to be presented as endangered
by patriarchy, both of American and Muslim men, but not Muslim women as
endangered by the racism of white men and women. Predictably then,
**[[there is]{.mark} considerable criticism of]{.underline}**
anti-racist and anti-colonial male **[leaders for their
sexism]{.underline}**, as there is of anti-racist feminists for
inadequate comprehension of their **[oppression, but [little substantive
critique]{.mark}]{.underline}** is to be found [**[of the racism of
white mainstream and radical feminisms]{.underline}**.]{.mark}
Disappointingly, this text demonstrates that **[a rejection of the
East/West binary can coexist with the re-inscription of a white gendered
subject position as innocent of, and removed from, its complicities with
empire-building]{.underline}**. Eisenstein's highlighting of male
violence in the US is certainly important, especially as patriarchal
practices in their Western and 'secular' garb are being removed from
scrutiny through the hypervisibility given to these practices in the
Islamic context. But **[[simply pointing to]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[white male domination]{.mark}]{.underline}** of white women [**[does
not really challenge the Western racialized-gendered discourse that has
defined non-white men as inherently, and far more, patriarchal and
violent]{.underline}**. **[This discourse]{.underline}**
**[has]{.underline}**]{.mark} now **[[become most virulently
anti-Muslim]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but [it has been directed in the
past against all third world peoples,]{.mark} most popularly through the
Western cultural constructs of Black and third world 'machismo'.
**[Eisenstein]{.underline}** surprisingly **[ignores]{.underline}**
**[this historical tradition]{.underline}** of the West **[as she argues
that a 'Global Misogyny']{.underline}** (2004: 150) **[lies at the core
of the current conflict,]{.underline}** with white women equally
threatened by it.

#### **Gender is not the root cause of war -- Efforts to end gender injustice must start by dealing with war -- Only the aff can provide the space necessary for change**.

**Goldstein 1 (Joshua S. Goldstein, Professor of International Relations
at American University, War and Gender: How Gender Shapes the War System
and Vice Versa, 2001, pp.411-412)**

First[, peace activists face a dilemma in thinking about causes of war
and working for peace. Many peace scholars and activists support the
approach, "if you want peace, work for justice." Then, [if **one
believes that sexism contributes to war one can work for gender justice
specifically**]{.mark} **(perhaps among others) [in order to pursue
peace]{.mark}**[. This approach]{.mark}]{.underline} brings strategic
allies to the peace movement (women, labor, minorities), but [[**rests
on the assumption that injustices cause war.** The
evidence]{.underline}]{.mark} in this book **[[suggests that causality
runs at least as strongly the other way. War is not a product of
capitalism, imperialism, gender, innate aggression, or any other single
caus]{.mark}e,]{.underline}** although all of these influence wars'
outbreaks and outcomes. **[[Rather, war has in part fueled and sustained
these and other injustices.9 So,"if you want peace, work for peace."
Indeed, if you want justice]{.underline}]{.mark}** (gender and others),
[**[work for peace]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Causality does not run just
upward through the levels of analysis, from types of individuals,
societies, and governments up to war. It runs downward too. Enloe
suggests [that [cha**nges in attitudes towards war and the military may
be the most important way to "reverse women's
oppression**.]{.underline}"]{.mark} The dilemma is that peace work
focused on justice brings to the peace movement energy, allies, and
moral grounding, yet, in light of this book's evidence, the emphasis on
injustice as the main cause of war seems to be empirically inadequate.

#### Patriarchy doesn\'t explain war---peace is more common, and patriarchal structures cannot be treated as constants

**Levy 98** \[Jack, Prof. Pol. Sci. -- Rutgers, Senior Associate --
Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies, and Past President --
International Studies Association, *Annual Review of Political Science*,
"The Causes of War and the Conditions of Peace", 1:139-165\]

[Another exception to the focus on variations in war and peace can be
found in some feminist theorizing about the outbreak of war, although
most feminist work on war focuses on the consequences of
war,]{.underline} particularly for women, rather than on the outbreak of
war (Elshtain 1987, Enloe 1990, Peterson 1992, Tickner 1992, Sylvester
1994). The argument is that the gendered nature of states, cultures, and
the world system contributes to the persistence of war in world
politics. This might provide an alternative (or supplement) to anarchy
as an answer to the first question of why violence and war repeatedly
occur in international politics, [[although the fact that peace is more
common than war makes it **difficult to argue** that
patriarchy]{.mark}]{.underline} (or anarchy) [[causes
war]{.underline}]{.mark}**.** Theories of patriarchy might also help
answer the second question of variations in war and peace, if they
identified differences in the patriarchal structures and gender
relations in different international and domestic political systems in
different historical contexts, and if they incorporated these
differences into empirically testable hypotheses about the outbreak of
war. This is a promising research agenda, and one that has engaged some
anthropologists. [[Most]{.underline}]{.mark} current [[feminist thinking
in political science about the outbreak of war, however, treats gendered
systems and patriarchal structures in the same way that neorealists
treat anarchy---as a constant---and consequently it **cannot explain
variations in war and peace.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Equating militarism and patriarchy assumes traditional gender roles and reinforces domination 

**hooks 95** \[bell, English professor and senior lecturer in Ethnic
Studies at the University of Southern California "Feminism and
Militarism: A Comment" *Women\'s Studies Quarterly*, Vol. 23, No. 3/4,
Rethinking Women\'s Peace Studies (Fall - Winter, 1995), pp. 58-64\]

[[By equaling militarism and patriarchy]{.underline}]{.mark}, these
[[feminists]{.mark}]{.underline} often [[structure their arguments
in]{.underline}]{.mark} such [[a way as to suggest that to be male is
synonymous with strength, aggression, and the will to
dominate]{.underline}]{.mark} and do violence to others [[and that to be
female is synonymous with weakness, passivity, and the will to
nourish]{.underline}]{.mark} and affirm the lives of others. While these
may be stereotypical norms that many people live out, [[such **dualistic
thinking is dangerous**; it is a basic ideological component of the
logic that informs and promotes domination in Western
society]{.mark}.]{.underline} Even when inverted and employed for a
meaningful purpose, like nuclear disarmament, it is nevertheless risky,
for [[it reinforces the cultural basis of sexism]{.mark}]{.underline}
and other forms of group oppression, suggesting as it does that women
and men are inherently different in some fixed and absolute way. It
implies that women by virtue of our sex have played no crucial role in
supporting and upholding imperialism (and the militarism that serves to
maintain imperialist rule) or other systems of domination. Often the
women who make such assertions arc white. Black women are very likely to
feel strongly that white women have been quite violent and militaristic
in their support and maintenance of racism.

#### MONO-CAUSAL UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE WORLD ARE PROBLEMATIC---WE SHOULD PREFER CAUSAL EXPLANATIONS THAT ACCOUNT FOR INTERACTIONS IN A SPECIFIC INSTANCE:

Milja **Kurki 2007** (Lecturer, Department of Int'l Politics, University
of Wales, Aberystwyth) Critical realism and causal analysis in
international relations, Millennium: Journal of International Studies,
34(5), accessed via Sage Journals Online.

However, as a consequence of its ontological, epistemological and
methodological leanings critical realism tends to prefer certain kinds
of substantive explanations of world political processes over others.
[[Critical realists tend to criticise mono-causal understandings of
world politics]{.underline}]{.mark}: whether singularly materialist
(characteristic of some realist thought) or singularly normative
(characteristic of some constructivist thought). Instead, [[they prefer
those causal explanations that account for the interactions of sets of
social relations and normative structures in historically situated
causal complexes.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### EXPLANATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS THAT RELY UPON INDIVIDUAL CAUSAL FORCES SHOULD BE REJECTED IN FAVOR OF EXPLANATIONS THAT ARE NUANCED AND SPECIFIC TO THE SITUATION:

Milja **Kurki 2007** (Lecturer, Department of Int'l Politics, University
of Wales, Aberystwyth) Critical realism and causal analysis in
international relations, Millennium: Journal of International Studies,
34(5), accessed via Sage Journals Online.

While in some natural sciences laboratory experiments can be conducted
to isolate individual causal forces, this is not what defines science in
natural sciences: this is an unrealistic and unnecessary expectation in
the social sciences, with dynamic ontological objects. It is true that
parsimonious accounts can be helpful in some contexts and that all
approaches must engage in some simplification. Yet it does not mean that
parsimony should be prioritised: [[oversimplification entails important
weaknesses in social explanations. Simplified analyses of complex social
processes do not necessarily provide]{.underline}]{.mark} the most
interesting, nor [[sufficiently nuanced, causal explanations to
facilitate adequate understanding of social issues.]{.underline}]{.mark}
As critics have pointed out it is not insignificant theoretically or
politically that positivist democratic peace theory, for example, has
tended to [[lack appreciation of the complex historical conditioning
of]{.underline}]{.mark} democratic [[politics within states and actions
of]{.underline}]{.mark} democratic [[states within global economic,
political and cultural relations]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS IS COMPLEX AND CONTEXT SPECIFIC---THE JUDGE SHOULD REWARD SPECIFICITY OF THE SITUATION OVER GRAND THEORIES OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.

Robert **Jervis, 1999** (Professor of International Politics at Columbia
University) Realism, neoliberalism, and cooperation. International
Security 24: 1. Accessed via Academic OneFile.

[[Often more fine-grained distinctions about preferences are required to
understand what needs to change]{.underline}]{.mark} to increase
cooperation. Because states have ladders of means-ends beliefs, some
preferences over outcomes are, from a broader perspective, preferences
over strategies. Thus many conflicts can be seen as both an avoidable
security dilemma and the product of irreconcilable differences. For
example, it can be argued that at bottom what
[[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark} sought [[in the 1930s]{.underline}]{.mark}
was security: dominance over the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere was
desired not as an ultimate value or even for national wealth but as a
source of strength and security. This in turn was needed not because
Japan was under immediate Western pressure -- this was an effect not a
cause of Japan\'s policy -- but rather because of the expectation that
eventually the West would menace Japan. Cooperation would have been
possible if the United States and Great Britain had been able to
reassure Japan of their continuing goodwill (assuming that Japan did not
engage in military adventures), but this was difficult if not impossible
for states in anarchy. Although Japan\'s ultimate goals would not have
to have changed to produce cooperation, \"[[mere\" alterations in images
of the other side and the deployment of conflict-reduction strategies
could not have kept the peace. Similarly, even if the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Soviet Union]{.underline}]{.mark}
ultimately [[sought security during the Cold War, deep internal changes
were a prerequisite for far-reaching cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}
because each believed that the other would be a menace as long as its
domestic system was in place.

#### POSTMODERN CRITICISMS MUST BE CONTEXTUALIZED TO THE INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES---SPECIFICITY SHOULD BE PRIVILEGED OVER SWEEPING GENERALIZATIONS:

Gearoid **Tuathail, 1996** (Department of Geography, Virginia
Polytechnic Institute and State University) The patterned mess of
history and the writing of geopolitics: a reply to Dalby. Political
Geography, 15: 6-7, p. 661.

In so doing, I hope to illustrate some of my earlier concerns about
[[postmodern narratives]{.underline}]{.mark} and historical complexity
using his very comment as an example. If I must state our positions as a
divide, [[I would characterize this]{.mark}]{.underline} divide
[[as]{.underline}]{.mark} one [[between an approach that skims history
to illustrate certain sweeping poststructuralist narratives and an
approach that seeks to move beyond the generality of these narratives
into a genuine dialogue with]{.mark}]{.underline} what Michael Mann has
termed [[the 'patterned mess' of history.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### Case Take-outs: Status Quo Solves

[The analytical and political move made in [the]{.mark} 19[94]{.mark}
[UNDP Report]{.mark}]{.underline} [[was]{.underline}]{.mark} [to equate
war with the state]{.underline} and move away from a concern with
territorially based definitions of security and inter-state war, which
it equates with militarism. There is **[[a shift in focus to the
spectrum of armed violence and non-conflict
violence]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which are to be remedied in the name of
human security, in part through the (re)construction of legitimate
coercive apparatuses. The shift away from militarism and towards human
security claims to acknowledge the changing character of conflict and
the role of the state in monopolising legitimate violence, without
privileging it unthinkingly. [**[Research in this vein has flourished in
the years since the 1994 report]{.mark}**, **[and brings significant

[such as]{.mark} the ability to account for [the geographical diversity

violence]{.mark}**, including the specific character of femicide as a
distinct form of violence; [and the incorporation of questions of public

#### Already government progress for including gender considerations in foreign policy--- world view already changing and aff isn't key

Ray **Acheson, 2018** the Director of Reaching Critical Will, Women's
International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF), \"The gender and
weapons nexus recognized; feminism need apply in 2019 and beyond,\"

<https://www.forumarmstrade.org/blog/the-gender-and-weapons-nexus-recognized-feminism-need-apply-in-2019-and-beyond>,
Retrieved 7/15/2019, rwg)

[[2018]{.underline}]{.mark}, for some reason, [[was a turning point for
international diplomatic recognition of gender dimensions of
weapons]{.mark} and disarmament [policy]{.mark}]{.underline}. After
years or even decades---or in WILPF's case, a century---of feminist
advocacy for governments and activists to take gender into account in
their work, [[we seem to breaking new ground]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
March, the Permanent Mission of Canada to the [United Nations in Geneva
collaborated with WILPF]{.underline}, Small Arms Survey, and the Gender
Mine Action Programme [on]{.underline} a one-day [training for
disarmament diplomats about including gender perspectives in their
work]{.underline}. In April, WILPF coordinated with the Canadian mission
in New York on a meeting that brought together the women, peace and
security (WPS) and disarmament diplomatic communities to exchange on the
same subject. In May, [[UN Secretary-General]{.underline}]{.mark}
António [[Guterres launched his new disarmament
agenda]{.underline},]{.mark} Securing our Common Future. [It
includes]{.underline} a section on "[[Ensuring the equal, full, and
effective participation of women,"]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[there are
several references]{.mark}]{.underline} throughout the document [[to the
gendered impacts of weapons, gender-sensitive arms control, or women's
participation in disarmament]{.underline},]{.mark} including [[urging
states to incorporate gender perspectives in]{.underline}]{.mark} their
national [legislation and [policies on]{.mark}]{.underline} disarmament
and [[arms control]{.underline}.]{.mark} In June, the Third Review
Conference to the UN Programme of Action on small arms and light weapons
(UNPoA) adopted a report with groundbreaking references to armed
gender-based violence, the gendered impacts of small arms, and women's
participation in disarmament. The document builds on gains made in 2012
and 2016 to alleviate the overall gender blindness of the UNPoA. The
International Action Network on Small Arms (IANSA) Women's Network
coordinated input and advocacy amongst civil society groups and
diplomats for the inclusion of these elements in the outcome document,
including through the civil society Call to Action on gender and small
arms control. In August, the [Convention on Certain Conventional
Weapons]{.underline} (CCW) considered gender issues for the first time,
[in a]{.underline} side [event]{.underline} hosted by the government of
Canada, International Committee for Robot Arms Control (ICRAC), Mines
Action Canada, Project Ploughshares, and WILPF on the relationship
between gender and fully autonomous weapons. [Participants addressed
gender diversity and equality in disarmament negotiations and
discussions; gender norms in relation to]{.underline} the development
and use of [weapons, gendered impacts of existing weapon systems; and
the importance of feminist foreign policy]{.underline} approaches in
relation to disarmament and arms control. In October, [the Canadian
mission to the UN organized a push to increase gender references in
resolutions]{.underline} at the UN General Assembly First Committee on
Disarmament and International Security. Working with other governments
and civil society groups, they managed to achieve language in 17
resolutions that advocates for women's equal participation, recognizes
gendered impacts of weapons, or urges consideration of gender
perspectives more broadly. [[This accounts for 25 percent of all First
Committee resolutions in 2018]{.underline}]{.mark}. Six of these
resolutions included gendered language for the first time, while three
improved the gendered language. For comparison, in 2017, 15 per cent of
resolutions made gender references. This figure was 13 per cent in 2016
and 12 per cent in 2015. The number of First Committee delegations
speaking about gender and disarmament in their statements also continued
to increase this year. Namibia on behalf of 56 states dedicated a whole
statement to this topic, urging examination of how "underlying
assumptions about how gender shapes \[delegations'\] own work and the
dynamics of joint disarmament efforts." Also in October, [the Latvian
ambassador, who will preside over the Fifth Conference of States Parties
to the Arms Trade Treaty]{.underline}, [announced that the
conference]{.underline} and its preparatory meetings [will focus on the
gender-based violence provision of the Treaty]{.underline} as a special
theme. This will provide an opportunity in 2019 to advance consideration
of how to implement this aspect of the ATT, including using guidance and
case studies published by groups like WILPF previously. In addition to
these forum-based efforts, [the UN Institute for Disarmament Research
joined the governments of Ireland, Namibia, and Canada to form the
Disarmament Impact Group as an output of the International Gender
Champions]{.underline}. The Group aims to "support the disarmament
community in translating gender awareness into practical action across
the range of multilateral disarmament processes and activities."
Meanwhile, academic sources like Critical Studies on Security and the
Oxford Handbook on Women, Peace and Security, news sources like The
Nation, and public speaking forums from TEDx to the London School of
Economics featured articles and talks about feminism, gender, and
weapons. This has signaled an opening of academic and activist spaces
for increased consideration of these issues. So, why has [[all
this]{.underline}]{.mark} happened so quickly? In reality, it hasn't. It
[[is built on a firm foundation of activism and analysis. Feminist
disarmament activists]{.mark} and academics]{.underline}, particularly
those with groups like WILPF and the IANSA Women's Network, [[have been
writing and campaigning on gender and disarmament for decades. UN
agencies and some governments have been working to mainstream gender in
their programming for a long time]{.underline}]{.mark}, certainly since
the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 in 2000. [[This has
led to concrete outcomes at international disarmament diplomacy
forums]{.mark} in recent years]{.underline}: [the first UN General
Assembly resolution on women, disarmament, non-proliferation and arms
control in 2010; the inclusion of gender-based violence in the Arms
Trade Treaty in 2013; the recognition of the gendered impacts of nuclear
weapons and encouragement of women's effective participation in
disarmament in the Non-Proliferation Treaty Chair's summary and the UN
Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in 2017]{.underline}.

### Case Take-outs: Realism is Correct

Q: Your analysis is based on massive amounts of research, such as on
Germany before World War I or France under Napoleon. Could you elaborate
on why you think in terms of a historical narrative? A: Well, [[about 20
years ago]{.underline}]{.mark}, what [[I began to]{.underline}]{.mark}
do was to try and [[think systematically about the history of great
power relations and see if I could find a pattern]{.mark}]{.underline}
that explained how states behaved as they grew more powerful. [[I came
to the conclusion that if you look at Napoleonic France, if you look at
Imperial Germany, if you look at Imperial Japan, if you look at the
Soviet Union, and especially if you look at the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, [[what you
see is that as these states all got more powerful, they all made an
effort to dominate their region of the world]{.underline}]{.mark}. They
all made an effort to make sure that they were the most powerful state
on the planet. You also see, when you look at the historical record,
that states that are powerful but not very powerful don\'t try and
pursue regional hegemony, because they don\'t have the military might.
This all led me to conclude that as states become more powerful their
appetite grows, and as their appetite grows their interest in dominating
the balance of power grows, because it\'s the best way to survive in a
very dangerous world. Q: In your studies, did you find any examples of a
country that became a great power but tried to peacefully coexist with
the rest of the world? A[[: I could not find a single example of a
country that became very powerful that didn\'t try to dominate its
region of the world.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### Case Turns: Essentialism Turns

#### Turn---Essentialism

#### Associating masculinity with militarism locks in gender stereotypes and causes men to stay in positions of power:

Iris **Young, 1990** (Professor of Public and International Affairs at
the University of Pittsburgh) THROWING LIKE A GIRL AND OTHER ESSAYS IN
FEMINIST PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIAL THEORY, 1990, 89-90.

Within the context of antifeminist backlash, [[the effect of gynocentric
feminism may be accommodating to the existing structure. Gynocentric
feminism]{.underline}]{.mark} relies on and [[reinforces gender
stereotypes]{.underline}]{.mark} at just the time when the dominant
culture has put new emphasis on marks of gender difference. It does so,
moreover, by relying on many of those aspects of women\'s traditional
sphere that traditional patriarchal ideology has most exploited and that
humanist feminists such as Beauvoir found most oppressive --
reproductive biology, motherhood, s domestic concerns. [[Even though its
intentions are subversive, such renewed attention to traditional
femininity can have a reactionary effect]{.mark}]{.underline} on both
ourselves and our listeners [[because it may echo
the]{.underline}]{.mark} dominant [[claim that women belong in a
separate sphere.]{.mark}]{.underline} Humanist feminism calls upon
patriarchal society to open places for women within those spheres of
human activity that have been considered the most creative, powerful,
and prestigious. Gynocentric feminism replies that wanting such things
for women implies a recognition that such activities are the most
humanly valuable. [[It argues that]{.underline}]{.mark} in fact,
[[militarism,]{.underline}]{.mark} bureaucratic hierarchy, competition
for recognition, [[and the instrumentalization of]{.underline}]{.mark}
nature and [[people]{.mark}]{.underline} entailed by these activities
[[are basic disvalues]{.underline}]{.mark}. Yet in contemporary society,
men still have most institutionalized power, and gynocentric feminism
shows why they do not use it well. [[If feminism turns its back on the
centers of power,]{.underline}]{.mark} privilege, and individual
achievement [[that men have monopolized, those men will continue to
monopolize them, and nothing significant will
change]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### THE AFF'S ASSOCIATIONS OF WOMEN WITH PEACE AND PATRIARCHY IS ESSENTIALIST AND DISEMPOWERING

J. Ann **Tickner, 1992** (Associate professor of political science at
the College of the Holy Cross) GENDER IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, 1992,
59.

Building on the notion of hegemonic masculinity, the notion of the
citizen-warrior depends on a devalued femininity for its construction.
In international relations, this devalued femininity is bound up with
myths about women as victims in need of protection; the
protector/protected myth contributes to the legitimation of a
militarized version of citizenship that results in unequal gender
relations that can precipitate violence against women. Certain feminists
have called for the construction of an enriched version of citizenship
that would depend less on military values and more on an equal
recognition of women\'s contributions to society. Such a notion of
citizenship cannot come about, however, until myths that perpetuate
views of women as victims rather than agents are eliminated. One such
myth is the association of women with peace, an association that has
been invalidated through considerable evidence of women\'s support for
men\'s wars in many societies.79 In spite of a gender gap, a plurality
of- women generally support war and national security policies; Bernice
Carroll suggests that the association of women and peace is one that has
been imposed on women by their disarmedcondition.80 In the West, this
association grew out of the Victorian ideology of women\'s moral
superiority and the glorification of motherhood. This ideal was
expressed by- feminist Charlotte Perkins Gilman whose book Herland was
first serialized in The Forerunner in 1915. Gilman glorified women as
caring and nurturing mothers whose private sphere skills could benefit
the world at large.81 Most turn-of-the-century feminists shared
Gilman\'s ideas. But [[if]{.underline}]{.mark} the implication of this
view -was that [[women were disqualified from participating in the
corrupt world of political and economic power by virtue of their moral
superiority, the result could only be the perpetuation of male

in the continuation of these [[essentializing myths]{.underline}]{.mark}
that can only [[result in the perpetuation of women\'s
subordination]{.underline}]{.mark} and reinforce dualisms that serve to
make men more powerful. [[The association of femininity with peace lends
support to]{.underline}]{.mark} an idealized masculinity that depends on
[[constructing women as passive victims in need of

#### Turn---Revolutionary feminist movements reinforce gender distinctions, leading to exclusivity and discrimination

**Mikkola**, Mari, 20**17**, \"Feminist Perspectives on Sex and Gender
(Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy),\" No Publication, 10-25-2017,
https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-gender/

Judith Butler critiques the sex/gender distinction on two grounds. She
critiques gender realism with her normativity argument (1999 \[original
1990\], chapter 1); she also holds that the sex/gender distinction is
unintelligible (this will be discussed in section 3.3.). [Butler\'s
normativity argument is not straightforwardly directed at the
metaphysical perspective of gender realism, but rather at its political
counterpart: identity politics.]{.underline} This is [a form of
political mobilization based on membership in some group]{.underline}
(e.g. racial, ethnic, cultural, gender[) and group membership is thought
to be delimited by some common experiences, conditions or features that
define the group]{.underline} (Heyes 2000, 58; see also the entry on
Identity Politics). **[[Feminist identity politics]{.mark}, then,
[presupposes gender realism in that feminist politics is]{.mark} said to
be [mobilized around women as a]{.mark} group (or [category]{.mark})
[where membership in this group is fixed by some condition]{.mark},
experience or feature that women supposedly share and [that defines
their gender]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Butler\'s normativity argument
makes two claims. The first is akin to Spelman\'s particularity
argument: [unitary gender notions fail to take differences amongst women
into account thus failing to recognise "the multiplicity of cultural,
social, and political intersections in which the concrete array of
'women' are constructed"]{.underline} (Butler 1999, 19--20). In their
attempt to undercut biologically deterministic ways of defining what it
means to be a woman, feminists inadvertedly created new socially
constructed accounts of supposedly shared femininity. Butler\'s second
claim is that such false gender realist accounts are normative. That is,
in their attempt to fix feminism\'s subject matter, feminists
unwittingly defined the term 'woman' in a way that implies there is some
correct way to be gendered a woman (Butler 1999, 5). That the definition
of the term 'woman' is fixed supposedly "operates as a policing force
which generates and legitimizes certain practices, experiences, etc.,
and curtails and delegitimizes others" (Nicholson 1998, 293). Following
this line of thought, one could say that, for instance, Chodorow\'s view
of gender suggests that 'real' women have feminine personalities and
that these are the women feminism should be concerned about. If one does
not exhibit a distinctly feminine personality, the implication is that
one is not 'really' a member of women\'s category nor does one properly
qualify for feminist political representation. Butler\'s second claim is
based on her view that[["\[i\]dentity categories]{.mark} \[like that of
women[\] are never merely descriptive, but always normative, and]{.mark}
as such, [exclusionary"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Butler 1991, 160). That
is, the mistake of those [[feminists]{.mark} Butler
critiques]{.underline} was not that they provided the incorrect
definition of 'woman'. Rather, (the argument goes) their [[mistake was
to attempt to define the term 'woman' at all.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Butler\'s view is that 'woman' can never be defined in a way that does
not prescribe some "unspoken normative requirements" (like having a
feminine personality) that women should conform to (Butler 1999, 9).
Butler takes this to be a feature of terms like 'woman' that purport to
pick out (what she calls) 'identity categories'. She seems to assume
that 'woman' can never be used in a non-ideological way (Moi 1999, 43)
and that it will always encode conditions that are not satisfied by
everyone we think of as women. Some explanation for this comes from
Butler\'s view that all processes of drawing categorical distinctions
involve evaluative and normative commitments; these in turn involve the
exercise of power and reflect the conditions of those who are socially
powerful (Witt 1995). In order to better understand Butler\'s critique,
consider her account of gender performativity. For her, [standard
[feminist accounts take gendered individuals to have some essential
properties]{.mark} qua gendered individuals or a gender core by virtue
of which one is either a man or a woman.]{.underline} This view assumes
that women and men, qua women and men, are bearers of various essential
and accidental attributes where the former secure gendered persons\'
persistence through time as so gendered. But according to Butler this
view is false: (i) there are no such essential properties, and (ii)
gender is an illusion maintained by prevalent power structures. First,
feminists are said to think that genders are socially constructed in
that they have the following essential attributes (Butler 1999, 24):
women are females with feminine behavioural traits, being heterosexuals
whose desire is directed at men; men are males with masculine
behavioural traits, being heterosexuals whose desire is directed at
women. These are the attributes necessary for gendered individuals and
those that enable women and men to persist through time as women and
men. Individuals have "intelligible genders" (Butler 1999, 23) if they
exhibit this sequence of traits in a coherent manner (where sexual
desire follows from sexual orientation that in turn follows from
feminine/ masculine behaviours thought to follow from biological sex).
**[[Social forces]{.mark} in general [deem individuals who exhibit
incoherent gender sequences]{.mark} (like lesbians) [to be doing their
gender 'wrong' and they actively discourage such sequencing of
traits]{.mark}, for instance, [via]{.mark} name-calling and overt
homophobic [discrimination]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Think back to what
was said above: having a certain conception of what women are like that
mirrors the conditions of socially powerful (white, middle-class,
heterosexual, Western) women functions to marginalize and police those
who do not fit this conception. [These gender cores,]{.underline}
supposedly encoding the above traits, however, [are nothing more than
illusions created by ideals and practices that seek to render gender
uniform through heterosexism, the view that heterosexuality is natural
and homosexuality is deviant]{.underline} (Butler 1999, 42). Gender
cores are constructed as if they somehow naturally belong to women and
men thereby creating gender dimorphism or the belief that one must be
either a masculine male or a feminine female. But gender dimorphism only
serves a heterosexist social order by implying that since women and men
are sharply opposed, it is natural to sexually desire the opposite sex
or gender. Further, being feminine and desiring men (for instance) are
standardly assumed to be expressions of one\'s gender as a woman. Butler
denies this and holds that gender is really performative. It is not "a
stable identity or locus of agency from which various acts follow;
rather, gender is ... instituted ... through a stylized repetition of
\[habitual\] acts" (Butler 1999, 179): through wearing certain
gender-coded clothing, walking and sitting in certain gender-coded ways,
styling one\'s hair in gender-coded manner and so on. Gender is not
something one is, it is something one does; it is a sequence of acts, a
doing rather than a being. And repeatedly engaging in 'feminising' and
'masculinising' acts congeals gender thereby making people falsely think
of gender as something they naturally are. Gender only comes into being
through these gendering acts: a female who has sex with men does not
express her gender as a woman. This activity (amongst others) makes her
gendered a woman. The constitutive acts that gender individuals create
genders as "compelling illusion\[s\]" (Butler 1990, 271). Our gendered
classification scheme is a strong pragmatic construction: social factors
wholly determine our use of the scheme and the scheme fails to represent
accurately any 'facts of the matter' (Haslanger 1995, 100). [People
think that there are true and real genders, and those deemed to be doing
their gender 'wrong' are not socially sanctioned. But, [genders are true
and real only to the extent that they are performed]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Butler 1990, 278--9). It does not make sense, then, to say of a
male-to-female trans person that s/he is really a man who only appears
to be a woman. Instead, males dressing up and acting in ways that are
associated with femininity "show that \[as Butler suggests\] 'being'
feminine is just a matter of doing certain activities" (Stone 2007, 64).
As a result, the trans person\'s gender is just as real or true as
anyone else\'s who is a 'traditionally' feminine female or masculine
male (Butler 1990, 278).\[5\] Without heterosexism that compels people
to engage in certain gendering acts, there would not be any genders at
all. And ultimately the aim should be to abolish norms that compel
people to act in these gendering ways. For Butler, [given that gender is
performative, [the appropriate response to feminist identity politics
involves two things]{.mark}. [First]{.mark}, feminists should
[understand 'woman' as]{.mark} open-ended and ["a term in
process]{.mark}, a becoming, a constructing [that cannot rightfully be
said to originate or end]{.mark} ... it is open to intervention and
resignification" (Butler 1999, 43). That is, [feminists should not try
to define 'woman']{.mark} at all. [Second]{.mark}, the category of women
"ought not to be the foundation of feminist politics" (Butler 1999, 9).
Rather, [feminists should focus on providing]{.mark} an account of [how
power functions and shapes our understandings of womanhood]{.mark} not
only in the society at large but also [within the feminist
movement.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Case Turns: Intersectionality Turns

#### Kritiks focus on patriarchy ignores the role race and social status plays in creation of oppression 

**Noh, 2003 (assistant professor of Asian American studies at California
State University, Fullerton, 2003 \[Eliza, Problematics of Transnational
Feminism for Asian American Women, The New Centennial Review 3.3,
Project Muse, Stevens\])**

Pluralizing \"women\'s oppression\" cannot get around the fact that
[**[there exist \"various forms]{.mark}**]{.underline} and degrees
[**[of patriarchal oppression, some]{.underline}** of **[which we share
\[with white women\], and some of which we do
not\"]{.underline}**]{.mark} (Lorde 1983b, 97). The experiences of Asian
American women show that [**[sexual domination cannot be separated from
other oppressions, unless one takes a narrow view of gendered experience
within our \"traditional\" cultures]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In his
important work, \"The Sexual Demon of White Power . . . in \'America\'
and Beyond\" (1999), Greg Thomas thoroughly elaborates processes of
sexualization via racialization and coloniality that challenge the
notion of universal sex. Within this framework, **[[the inadequacy of
feminism to account for multiple, simultaneous oppressions, in
particular the centrality of experiences of racialization and
coloniality to sexualization, is precisely why different gender
identities]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such as \"womanist,\" **[[become
necessary]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This is]{.underline}** also **[why the
Combahee River Collective]{.underline}** (1983) **[uses the term
\"racial-sexual oppression]{.underline}**\"---\"which is neither solely
racial nor solely sexual, e.g., the history of rape of Black women by
white men as a weapon of political repression\" (213). In the classes
where I have worked with Asian American women and other women of color,
I often hear it stated that they cannot imagine identifying first with
\[End Page 141\] white women on the basis of gender or sex over their
cultural communities on the basis of ethnicity or race. I think that
this does not necessarily reflect a naïve ranking of race over gender,
but the predominant experiential reality of racialized sex for nonwhite
women. The implications of transnational feminism for Asian/American
[15](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/new_centennial_review/v003/3.3noh.html#FOOT15#FOOT15)
women create artificial solidarities with white women where there may
not be a common ground, whether subjectively or sociopolitically.
[**Even if a contingent similarity exists between women---where
Asian-based, patriarchal sex- gender systems claim Asian American women
just as European-based patriarchies claim white, Anglo women---it is
important to look at the specificities of these relationships within
their own contexts**.]{.underline} The different racial and gender
experiences of Asian women may separate, on the basis of race and sex,
Asian feminine subjects as far apart from white femininity as they may
be from Asian masculine subjects.

#### This dooms the K---only differentiating the ways in which patriarchal violence is located can create true solidarity

**Noh 2003 (assistant professor of Asian American studies at California
State University, Fullerton, 2003 \[Eliza, Problematics of Transnational
Feminism for Asian American Women, The New Centennial Review 3.3,
Project Muse, Stevens\])**

I would like to investigate briefly the desire fueling transnational
feminism\'s attempt to create alliances across boundaries, by looking at
the ramifications of travel as elaborated in transnational feminist
theories. In an era of cyberspace and jet travel, defining one\'s
location
[^18^](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/new_centennial_review/v003/3.3noh.html#FOOT18#FOOT18)
can demystify notions of difference and similarity associated with
postmodernist accounts of border-crossing (Kaplan 1994, 138). But [when
I think of what a feminist colleague said to me about the]{.underline}
apparent academic [anachronism of \"1980s women-of-color feminist
identity politics]{.underline},\" after the arrival of postmodern
feminist \"identity deconstructionism,\" [I glimpse]{.underline} the
backlash against Third-World women\'s organizing,
[^19^](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/new_centennial_review/v003/3.3noh.html#FOOT19#FOOT19)
and [the limits of simply questioning one\'s location as one travels
without addressing the continuing material and subjective barriers that
differentiate]{.underline} at least a vast [half of the world\'s
population. If identity politics represent
\"essentialist,\"]{.underline} and therefore politically
\"unsophisticated\" tools for making interpersonal connections, compared
to the mechanisms of self-critique implicit in fluid, postmodern
identities, [what happens after deconstruction? Does historicizing
location make travel easier while subjective and material barriers
remain?]{.underline} [I was reminded of this distance]{.underline}, if
not rupture, [in subjectivity]{.underline} and experience
[^20^](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/new_centennial_review/v003/3.3noh.html#FOOT20#FOOT20)
[by]{.underline} the [reactions of white feminists at an international
women\'s studies conference]{.underline} where I first presented this
paper. [I watched their]{.underline} facial [expressions change from
amusement to disdain as they realized I was propounding the importance
of Asian feminist nationalism as a critique of \"transnational\"
feminist erasures.]{.underline} While the few Asian women in the room
expressed agreement with my ideas, I was not surprised that in this
instance, like many others, some white women \"just didn\'t get it.\"
[[We must deconstruct and historicize the reasons for our
divergences]{.underline},]{.mark} but it seems [that [crossing lines
would ncessitate overcoming]{.underline}]{.mark}, in actuality, [those
histories of subjective and material barriers.]{.underline} [This
remains]{.underline} an incredibly [difficult]{.underline} task, [since
people are so entrenched in their material and subjective]{.underline}
(conscious and unconscious) [investments in relations of
power.]{.underline} In my opinion, [oppositional identity politics
continue to be necessary insofar as intersubjectivity operates purely as
an intellectual exercise, and not as an active commitment to destroying
the hegemony of certain cultural egos.]{.underline} As Moraga (1983)
states, we must decide to \"make faith a reality and to bring all of our
selves to bear down hard on that reality\" (xix). Making international
connections and mobilizations is important to Asian American women
concerned with progressive theory and practice because our lives are
already linked with other national contexts through imperialism,
migration, labor, race, and culture. Therefore, feminist nationalist
consciousness cannot afford to take a myopic approach to issues that
seem to affect us only within the national, domestic sphere. Neither can
Asian American cultural struggle take a transcendental view of
internationalism, for often official state nationalisms collude, serving
state interests in the name of internationalism or transnationalism[. [A
similar warning can be made about transnational feminist projects, which
must be grounded through tracking histories of cultural difference and
rupture. Without a critical eye honed from collective cultural
experiences of material conditions, the commitment to a different
practice of feminism cannot seem to move beyond a superficial level of
emotional investment.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### The alternative's "gender alone" focus reinforces the dominant paradigms they attempt to fight

**Crenshaw 91 (Kimberlie Crenshaw, 91. professor of law @ UCLA, 1991.
("Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and
Violence Against Women of Color." Stanford Law Review, July, 43 Stan. L.
Rev. 1241, L/N))**

The concept of political intersectionality highlights the fact that
women of color are situated within at least two subordinated groups that
frequently pursue conflicting political agendas. [The need to split
one\'s political energies between two sometimes opposing groups is a
dimension of intersectional disempowerment that men of color and white
women seldom confront]{.underline}. Indeed, [their]{.underline} specific
raced and gendered [experiences]{.underline}, although intersectional,
often define as well as confine the interests of the entire group. For
example, racism as experienced by people of color who are of a
particular gender \-- male \-- tends to determine the parameters of
antiracist strategies, just as sexism as experienced by women who are of
a particular race \-- white \-- tends to ground the women\'s movement.
The problem is not simply that both discourses fail women of color by
not acknowledging the \"additional\" issue of race or of patriarchy but
that [[the discourses are often inadequate]{.mark} even [to]{.mark} the
discrete tasks of [articulating the full dimensions of racism and
sexism]{.mark}.]{.underline} Because [women of color
experience]{.underline} racism in ways not always the same as those
experienced by men of color and [[sexism in ways not always parallel to
experiences of white women, antiracism and feminism are
limited]{.underline}]{.mark}, even on their own terms. Among the most
troubling political consequences of the failure of antiracist and
feminist discourses to address the intersections of race and gender is
the fact that, to the extent they can forward the interest of \"people
of color\" and \"women,\" respectively, [[one analysis often implicitly
denies the validity of the other. The failure]{.mark}]{.underline} of
feminism [[to interrogate race means that the resistance strategies of
feminism will often replicate and reinforce the subordination of people
of color]{.mark},]{.underline} and the failure of antiracism to
interrogate patriarchy means that antiracism will frequently reproduce
the subordination of women. These mutual elisions present a particularly
difficult political dilemma for women of color. Adopting either analysis
constitutes a denial of a fundamental dimension of our subordination and
precludes the development of a political discourse that more fully
empowers women of color.

### Case Turns: Racism Turns

#### The alternative's exclusive focus on gender undermines efforts to challenge racism.

Kimberle **Crenshaw, 1992** (Professor of Law at Columbia University,
Southern California Law Review, March 1992. Accessed via Academic
Lexis/Nexis, May 26, 2011)

[[There are other political dilemmas, that await the women\'s movement
if it does not]{.underline}]{.mark} undertake the difficult task of
constructing a political program that [[address]{.underline}]{.mark}es
[[these intersections]{.underline}]{.mark}. A central problem that was
revealed during the Hearings is that [[women\'s issues are often seen by
the public as representing the selected concerns of a
few]{.mark}]{.underline} well placed, [[overly influential white
women]{.underline}]{.mark}. One of the most troubling manifestations of
this attitude is represented by those who claim that any Black woman who
raises a gender related issue is simply acting on the white women\'s
agenda and not on that of the Black community. Apparently a Black woman
who has been harassed, or raped, or battered cannot conclude on her own
that this behavior is damaging to her as a Black woman. Of course, Black
feminists and other feminists of color have rejected these claims and
have labored to uncover the many ways that nonwhite communities are
affected by sexism. However, white feminist politicians and other
activists must do their part to address some of the reasons why this
perception persists. [[Organized women must affirmatively act to make
women\'s issues relevant to communities of color as well of to working
class and poor women. This effort requires that they go beyond the usual
practice of incorporating only those aspects of women\'s lives that
appear to be familiar as \"gender\" while marginalizing those issues
that seem to relate solely to class or to race]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Mainstream feminist approaches unwittingly entrench racism.

Kimberle **Crenshaw, 1992** (Professor of Law at Columbia University,
Southern California Law Review, March 1992. Accessed via Academic
Lexis/Nexis, May 26, 2011)

I would like to build upon both those metaphors as a means to uncover
the particular ways in which Black women are silenced between the rocks
and the hard places of racism and sexism. One way of beginning to think
about this space is suggested by the concept of intersectionality.
[[African-American women by virtue of our race and gender are situated
within at least two systems of subordination: racism and
sexism.]{.mark}]{.underline} This dual vulnerability does not simply
mean that our burdens are doubled but instead, that the dynamics of
racism and sexism intersect in our lives to create experiences that are
sometimes unique to us. In other words, our [[experiences of racism are
shaped by our gender, and our experiences of sexism are often shaped by
our race.]{.underline}]{.mark} The rocks and hard places that make it so
difficult for Black women to articulate these experiences, however, are
not simply racism and sexism, but instead, [[the oppositional politics
of mainstream feminism and antiracism. Because each movement focuses on
gender or race exclusive of the other, issues reflecting the
intersections of race and gender are alien to both movements.
Consequently]{.underline}]{.mark}, although [[Black
women]{.underline}]{.mark} are formally constituents of both, their
[[intersectional interests are addressed by
neither]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Solvency NEG: Focus on Discourse Will Fail

#### Focusing on language as the sphere of feminist critique blunts its political force:

Iris **Young, 1990** (Professor of Public and International Affairs at
the University of Pittsburgh) THROWING LIKE A GIRL AND OTHER ESSAYS IN
FEMINIST PHILOSOPHYAND SOCIAL THEORY, 1990, 89-90.

Feminists cannot undermine masculinist values without entering some of
the centers of power that foster them, but the attainment of such power
itself requires at least appearing to foster those values. Still,
without being willing to risk such co-optation, feminism can be only a
moral position of critique rather than a force for institutional change.
Despite its intention, I fear that [[gynocentric feminism may have the
same consequence as the stance of moral motherhood
that]{.underline}]{.mark} grew out of nineteenth century feminism a
[[resegregation of women to a specifically women\'s sphere, outside the
sites of power]{.underline}]{.mark}, privilege, and recognition. For me
the symptom here is what the dominant culture finds more threatening.
Within the dominant culture a middle-aged assertive woman\'s claim to
coanchor the news alongside a man appears considerably more threatening
than women\'s claim to have a different voice that exposes masculinist
values as body-denying and selfish. [[The claim of women to have a right
to the positions]{.mark}]{.underline} and benefits [[that have hitherto
been reserved for men]{.underline}]{.mark}, and that male dominated
institutions should serve women\'s needs, [[is a direct threat to male
privilege. While the claim that these positions of power themselves
should be eliminated]{.underline}]{.mark} and the institutions
eliminated or restructured [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} indeed [[more
radical, when asserted from the gynocentric feminist position it can be
an objective retreat. Gynocentrism's focus on]{.underline}]{.mark}
values and [[language as the primary target of its critique contributes
to this blunting of its political force.]{.mark}]{.underline} Without
doubt, social change requires changing the subject, which in turn means
developing new ways of speaking, writing, and imagining. Equally
indubitable is the gynocentric feminist claim that masculinist values in
Western culture deny the body, sensuality, and rootedness in nature and
that such denial nurtures fascism, pollution, and nuclear games. Given
these facts, however, what shall we do? To this gynocentrism has little
concrete answer. Because its criticism of existing society is so global
and abstract, gynocentric critique of values, language, and culture of
masculinism can remove feminist theory from analysis of specific
institutions and practices, and how they might be concretely
structurally changed in directions more consonant with our visions.

### Solvency NEG: Movement will be co-opted

#### Feminist movements will be co-opted to expand the powers of the state

**Dzodan**, Flavia, **17**, Editor for This Independent Woman, \"The new
Alt-Feminism, when white supremacy met women's empowerment,\" Medium,
1-6-2017,
<https://medium.com/this-political-woman/the-new-alt-feminism-when-white-supremacy-met-womens-empowerment-b978b088db33>

[[Much has been written about]{.mark} what is popularly known as "[white
feminism]{.mark}"]{.underline}. Catherine Young wrote the most
comprehensive breakdown of its definition and what white feminism
entails politically. This form of feminism is [[also sometimes called
"liberal/neoliberal feminism"]{.mark} or "Lean In feminism" [because of
its]{.mark} persistent [focus on corporate careers at the expense of
other sociopolitical issues that affect women.]{.mark}]{.underline} In
2013, when I started tracking the rise of this sort of hyper individual,
mostly white corporate feminism to the mainstream, I wrote [The result
of this constitution of neoliberal feminism as "the neutral" or the
default, has also led to a sense of "amplified agency". We are told to
"maximize our freedom", we should "brand ourselves better", we should
"choose our choices" and demand a better distribution of the resources.
In the process, [we are left with a feminism that imposes on us the
moral task of maximizing our own value.]{.mark} This is a
[feminism]{.mark} of the individual [with an inflated sense of the
self]{.mark} that is devoted to the creation and administration of
individual business opportunities in detriment of systemic change or, at
the very least, in detriment of an analytical approach that examines our
individual relations as part of a whole and our interactions and
participation in a system of inequalities we cannot escape.]{.underline}
In the past four years, since I wrote the above, many political changes
have taken place. Mostly, we have witnessed a relentless growth of
extreme right ideologies vying for positions of power in North America
and Europe. Donald Trump, Geert Wilders, Marine Le Pen, Nigel Farage,
the list of people advocating white supremacist ideologies to position
themselves within their respective electorates goes on. It then stands
to reason that, vis a vis this mainstreaming of white supremacy, women's
issues would follow suit (after all, they are half of their respective
voter bases). Enter what I call "the alt-fem" or "alt-feminism", a
repurposing and expansion of white feminism to explicitly serve white
supremacy. As part of this expansion, women like Megyn Kelly or Ivanka
Trump are lauded as feminists advancing the cause of women's equality,
even though they both support extreme right and racist ideologies. In
2007, Jasbir Puar published "Terrorist Assemblages: Homonationalism in
Queer Times". In her book [[Puar laid down the associations between
nationalist ideologies and LGBTIQ rights]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this
[cooptation of gay/queer rights and discourses of sexual diversity,
nationalist and [white supremacist ideas]{.mark} are [coupled with "gay
friendly" rhetoric to expand the]{.mark} powers of the nation
[State.]{.mark} T he current [co-optation of feminism by right wing
ideologists seem to follow **a similar pattern**]{.mark}]{.underline}
that adds to an already long history of feminism as a tool to advance
colonial and corporate interventions. As Professor Jessie Daniels
pointed out, this white supremacist feminism is the logical endpoint of
white, neoliberal feminism. However, [**[this cooptation of feminism by
right wing ideologues didn't happen overnight]{.underline}**.]{.mark} In
2011, CNN published an op-ed extolling Michele Bachmann's evangelical
feminism. They claimed that "some religion and politics experts say that
she exemplifies an evangelical feminism that is producing more female
leaders in Christian nonprofits, businesses, and education and
politics". Around the same time that she was lauded as an "evangelical
feminist icon", Bachmann saluted the upside to chattel slavery as a
"positive for Black families". The same year that Michele Bachmann was
profiled by CNN, the British paper The Telegraph interviewed Marine Le
Pen about her rise to Front National leadership. In the profile that
ensued, they repeatedly spoke of her "feminist politics" and her
"feminist appeal". The Economist unapologetically celebrated Sarah Palin
as a feminist noting her gratitude "to those brave feminist foremothers
who struggled and sacrificed, endured imprisonment and ridicule...to
grant future generations of American women a voice." [Margaret Thatcher
has been repeatedly celebrated as a feminist icon]{.underline} as well,
[erasing the disastrous consequences of her policies on millions of
working class and poor women across the UK.]{.underline} In turn, other
feminists (mostly those writing from and about the margins of gender,
race, sexuality, disability, working class, etc) resisted this inclusion
of obviously non feminist women into the mainstream. However, whatever
resistance was vociferously laid down, it didn't help to prevent us from
getting to the point where some of the most read media such as Vanity
Fair or The Daily Beast celebrate Megyn Kelly's "feminism". [Perhaps one
of the reasons why this co-optation might be easily available is that
mainstream white feminism failed to articulate how to move beyond
individual white women and their issues,]{.underline} encapsulated in
the 70s slogan of "the personal is political" and into a system wide
definition of women's empowerment that included issues beyond gender. By
embracing the personal in the form of the individual and never setting
any ideological goals beyond "career for mostly white women", this
feminism could be easily co-opted by any woman who just attaches the
label to herself or by any media outlet that pins it on a woman (whether
she claims it for herself or not). As long as the woman in question
could claim that her politics were rooted in her personal, individual
experience, she could call herself (or be called) a feminist. With the
mainstreaming of eugenics as part of right wing ideologies seizing

especially considering how the white supremacists that call themselves

women in so far as these rights enable births of white babies in greater
numbers. [I foresee that if these ideas continue moving forward, [the

### Solvency NEG---Opening Up Space Will Fail

#### Opening up space for new ways of knowing won't affect international violence.

Relations at the University of South Australia), International Relations
and the third debate, ed: Jarvis, 2002, p. 80-81

[[Revolutionary change]{.underline}]{.mark} of the kind desired by
George [[ignores that fact that many individuals are not disposed to
concerns beyond their family, friends, and daily
work]{.underline}]{.mark} lives. And institutional, structural
transformation requires organized effort, mass popular support, and
dogged single-mindedness if societal norms are to be challenged,
institutional reform enacted, consumer tastes altered, and political
sensibilities reformed. Convincing Nike that there is something
intrinsically wrong with paying Indonesian workers a few dollars a week
to manufacture shoes for the global market requires considerably more
effort than postmodern platitudes and/or moral indignation. The cycle of
wealth creation and distribution that sees Michael Jordan receive
multimillion dollar contracts to inspire demand for Nike products, while
the foot soldiers in the factory eke out a meager existence producing
these same products is not easily, or realistically, challenged by
pronouncements of moving beyond International Relations to a new, nicer,
gentler nirvana. More generally, of course, what George fails to
consider is the problem of apathy and of how we get people to care about
the plight of others. What do we with the CEOs of multinational
corporations, stockbrokers, accountants, factory workers, and the
unemployed, who, by and large, fail to consider the homeless and
destitute in their own countries, let alone in places they have never
visited and are never likely to visit? [[Moral indignation rarely
translates into action, and apathy about the plight of others is a
structural impediment as strong any idea, theory,]{.underline}]{.mark}
or writing. What George\'s treatise thus fails to consider is [[how we
overcome this, and how we get others to listen.]{.underline}]{.mark} He
needs to explain how the social, political, psychological, and moral
structures that define the parameters of existence for the many millions
of ordinary citizens in the first world, and that deflects attention
from the marginalized and the oppressed can be broken down.
Unfortunately, there is little to indicate that George has thought much
about this, suggesting that his [[commitment to postmodern theory is not
likely to make much difference]{.underline}]{.mark}. In fact, in the
academy the postmodern light is already beginning to dim in certain
quarters, having registered scarcely a glimmer in the broader polity,
where, if change was to ensue, it needed to burn brightly. Even among
those versed in the nomenclature of scholarly debate, theorists of
international politics remain skeptical of the value of postmodern
discourse, by and large rejecting it. This does not portend well for
postmodern visionaries and the future of postmodern discourse. But can
George really be surprised by this? After all, his discourse indicts the
\"backward discipline\" for complicity in crimes against humanity,
calling for a repudiation of realism and with it a repudiation of the
lifelong beliefs and writings of eminent theorists like Kenneth Waltz,
Robert Gilpin, and Stephen Krasner who have otherwise defined the
parameters of the discipline, its projects, and research agendas. Can
George really expect discipline-wide capitulation to an intellectual
diaspora that would see theorists repudiate their beliefs and works in
order to take up the creed of postmodernism, as vague, open-ended, and
indeterminate as it is? [[Without a clear and credible plan of how to
get from \"incarceration and closure\" to intellectual
freedom,]{.mark}]{.underline} creativity, and openness, George\'s
[[postmodern musings have understandably attracted few
disciples.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### [Solvency NEG: Tokenism]{.underline}

Women's groups, which are caught between male-dominated national and
international structures and constrained by a lack of funds, have also
realized that their impact would have been greater if there had been an
orchestrated approach with other women's organizations in the region.
[[Women's peacebuilding activities have also proved only to be popular
and sustainable if endorsed by the international
community]{.underline}]{.mark}. Vankovska warns that [[the positive, yet
limited, involvement of women's organizations might actually prove
counter-productive since women's sparse and symbolic involvement can
still be exploited by government actors to counter calls for greater
gender equality]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Since the rise of conservativism in America, [[there has been much
discussion on the Left about progressives\' alleged failure to offer
robust alternatives to free-market and religious fundamentalist
ideologies,]{.underline}]{.mark} as well as calls for \"courage to open
the door of political and legal thought as if the wolves were not
there.\" [[The result has been some uncomfortable conversations among
progressives and tensions in critical left intellectual
movements]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, Janet [[Halley has written
against the idea that feminism is an indispensible element of any
adequate theory of sexuality and gender. She suggests that those
interested in developing new insights about power and sexuality might
benefit from \"tak\[ing\] a break from feminism.]{.underline}]{.mark}\"

### Solvency NEG: Alt Causes

#### Alt cause---Trump has crushed women's rights:

Sabrina **Siddiqui**, 1/18/20**18** (political reporter, "How has Donald
Trump\'s first year affected women?"

Retrieved 7/16/2019, rwg)

[[A year since women marched across the world in protest of Trump, many
view his presidency as 'the worst we've ever seen for
women']{.mark}]{.underline} On the day after Donald Trump was sworn in
as the 45th president of the United States last January, millions of
women took to the streets in pink-knitted "pussy hats" in protests that
marked the birth of the so-called "resistance" to the incoming
administration. One year later, the #MeToo movement has spawned a moment
of reckoning around sexual misconduct and gender equality. The
unprecedented dialogue has brought down powerful men from entertainment,
media and politics, while signaling the beginning of a transformational
period for women in the workplace that has been decades in the making.
But between the bookends, [[women's rights advocates have had to contend
with the first year of the Trump presidency, which they view as a return
to restrictive policies on abortion and
contraception]{.underline}]{.mark}. And [[for every man whose career is
cut short amid allegations of misconduct, there is the juxtaposition of
Trump holding the highest office]{.underline}]{.mark} in the nation
[[despite standing accused by as many as 17 women of sexual
assault]{.underline}]{.mark}. He denies the claims. On Friday, almost
one year to the day since he was inaugurated, Trump will become the
first sitting president to address the March for Life, an annual
anti-abortion gathering on the National Mall in Washington. "[[This
administration]{.underline}]{.mark} is the worst we've ever seen for
women and families," said Kaylie Hanson Long, a spokeswoman for Naral
Pro-Choice America, a pro-choice advocacy group. "[[Its attacks on
reproductive freedom are relentless]{.underline}]{.mark}, under the
radar and aren't supported by the majority of Americans who believe
abortion should remain legal." Much of Trump's first year in office has
been dedicated to undoing the work of his predecessor, from rescinding
the requirement in Barack Obama's healthcare law that employers provide
contraception coverage, to rolling back a rule introduced under his
predecessor designed to close the gender pay gap. In one of his first
acts, [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} -- surrounded by a large group of men
in what became a notorious photograph -- [[reinstated a "global gag
rule" policy that restricts the US government from providing funds to
international family-planning organizations]{.underline}]{.mark} that
offer abortion-related services. He later expanded it, affecting nearly
\$9bn in funding to combat global health issues such as HIV/Aids, Zika
and malaria. [[Trump has also backed proposals to defund Planned
Parenthood and signed Republican-passed legislation that paved the way
for state and local governments to block abortion clinics from receiving
federal funds]{.underline}]{.mark}. To some observers, Trump's actions
are the natural byproduct of "unified Republican control" in Washington.
"It's not necessarily just because of Donald Trump," said Jennifer
Lawless, the director of American University's Women and Politics
Institute. "It's because of a Republican White House and two Republican
chambers in Congress." Indeed, Republicans have led efforts -- albeit to
mixed success -- to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature
healthcare reform. They have also sought to advance legislation to
curtail abortion rights, with the president's blessing. The House of
Representatives approved a 20-week abortion ban in October, although the
Senate does not appear to have the votes to send the bill to the
president's desk. There are also subtle yet substantive ways in which
the Trump administration has sought to redefine how women's reproductive
issues are considered in government policy. It was reported in December
that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was banned
from using the word "fetus", among other terms such as "transgender" and
"science-based", in its 2018 budget documents. Analysts suggested other
parts of the Department of Health and Human Services might also be
subject to the ban, which could undermine the development of materials
examining the effects of the Zika virus on a developing fetus.
Pro-choice advocates similarly saw a draft strategic plan released by
the HHS in September as notable in part for its conspicuously coded
language. The proposed plan, which would encompass 2018-2022, contained
several references to life "beginning at conception" and to "the
unborn". The phrasing marked a departure from previous administrations,
which proponents of women's reproductive rights believe provided Trump's
HHS with "a license to discriminate". The most influential cultural
shift in women's reproductive rights could arguably be in the work of
the federal courts, where judicial vacancies are poised to be filled by
Trump nominees who overwhelmingly consist of white males. Trump
inherited nearly double the number of court vacancies of his
predecessor, in part because Republicans successfully blocked Obama from
filling many of those seats. Among Trump's picks for federal courts are
a nominee who likened the "personhood" for fetuses to the rights of
Native and African Americans, and another who questioned the legality of
abortion. At the highest level, the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the
supreme court prompted fears among advocates over the future of Roe v
Wade, the landmark 1973 supreme court ruling that legalized abortion in
the US. In replacing the late justice Antonin Scalia, Gorsuch restored
the conservative tilt to the supreme court after Republicans denied
Obama a vote on Merrick Garland, the nominee of his choice. Should Trump
oversee another vacancy, a long-running campaign to restrict abortion
rights could find affirmation in the nation's highest court. Gorsuch
reluctantly declared Roe v Wade "the law of the land" after relentless
questioning by Democrats at his confirmation hearing. But he also argued
it was a "precedent" and has sided with conservatives on the issue of
religious freedom in the broader context of women's reproductive rights.
During his tenure on the US court of appeals for the 10th circuit,
Gorsuch ruled that closely held, for-profit businesses were not required
to cover contraception on religious grounds. The decision was later
upheld by the supreme court. Among the most notable examples of the
correlation between the views of Trump appointees and administration
policy was the case of an undocumented, pregnant teenager, which became
the subject of a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union
last year. The teenager, whose identity was protected, was blocked from
obtaining an abortion by Scott Lloyd, who was appointed by Trump to head
the Office of Refugee Resettlement. Although the courts ultimately sided
with the teenager, previous articles penned by Lloyd revealed a record
of controversial views on abortion and contraception -- including his
belief that women who receive federally funded birth control should be
forced to sign a pledge that they will not have an abortion. Lawless
said while Trump's record might leave advocates dismayed, if not
unsurprised, the rallying cry behind #MeToo has brought rare consensus
around the issue of sexual harassment. Although Republicans have thus
far ignored the allegations against Trump, bipartisan legislation has
emerged in Congress to overhaul how sexual misconduct claims are handled
on Capitol Hill. "There's no question the behavior is being condemned
right now," Lawless said. March for Life: Trump to give anti-abortion
demo a rare endorsement Read more Advertisement "The Women's March did a
lot to catalyze activists and generate a sense of momentum. Coupled with
social media, it provided this fertile ground for the MeToo movement to
emerge and ultimately sustain itself." Groups such as Emily's List,
which work to elect pro-choice Democratic women to public office, have
cited a boom in female candidates for office in the Trump era. "In the
year since Trump has been inaugurated, women have responded by marching,
organizing, building movements, voting and running for office," said
Christina Reynolds, a spokeswoman for Emily's List. "They've pushed back
against a White House and Republican Congress driving an agenda that
hurts families and their communities, and come November, those women
will replace them in office."

Which is what happened when he turned his piercing eye on women's
condition. [[Dell proposed that the battle between the sexes was a
surface manifestation of a]{.mark} deeper, bloodier conflict, a
[struggle]{.mark} enlisting both men and women [to defend "the soul"
against]{.mark} the slave raiders of [capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}
He saw women in the vanguard, shock troops in a war that would unshackle
men as well. **[[Women's liberation]{.mark}, in his plain distillation,
[would "make it possible for the first time for men to be
free."]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[As long as women are men's **childlike
dependents**]{.underline}]{.mark}---and as long as men can derive a
false sense of power from being "lords in a thirty-dollar flat" in which
they stash their child-wives---"the bravest things will not be done in
the world." Men will cling to their dollhouse dominance, too fearful to
trade that false security for the great grapple with their real
oppressors. At the same time, Dell could see---and far earlier than
most---that the economic tide was turning, and that it was "taking more
and more women every year out of the economic shelter of the home into
the great world, making them workers and earners along with men." The
women, he predicted, would take the men with them, emancipating them
from the hollow gratifications of their petty domestic tyrannies---and
ultimately from the yoke of wage-slave subservience[. [Feminism would
"give \[men\] back their souls]{.underline}]{.mark}[, so that they can
risk them fearlessly in the adventure of life."]{.underline} One hundred
years on, how is that battle going? Feminism has secured for women a
substantial beachhead in the public realms of education, employment, and
professional life. The achievements are well known and endlessly
reiterated: American women are nearly 60 percent of undergraduates, 50
percent of law and medical school students, 40 percent of business
school students. They are 51 percent of employees in management,
professional, and related positions. About 60 percent of women older
than sixteen are in the workforce, and more than 70 percent of mothers
with children younger than eighteen work. In 2009 women became half of
all U.S. workers, a statistic widely hailed as a watershed event in
American sexual politics. "The battle of the sexes is over," proclaimed
The Shriver Report: A Woman's Nation Changes Everything, a
much-ballyhooed collaboration between the Center for American Progress
and former California first lady Maria Shriver. (The report's evidence:
a Time magazine poll that supposedly determined that gender strife had
been replaced with amicable "negotiation.") Has women's rising
prominence in the workplace "freed" men, as Dell hoped? Has it unchained
men from the false "choice between being a slave and a scoundrel"? Has
it given them back their souls? Granted, it's hard to quantify freedom,
much less soul reclamation. Yet one would be hard pressed to summon
evidence of men using women's newfound independence to embolden their
own. Where are the great male revolts against corporate rule,
militarism, the rat race? Between the rare flashpoints---an anti-WTO
protest here, an Occupy encampment there---the American political
landscape is largely quiescent, complacent, and resigned. [Our new [male
"rebels" are]{.mark} generally that [in name only]{.mark}---[the]{.mark}
Mark [Zuckerbergs]{.mark} and Jeff Bezoses [who advocate "breaking
things" only to consolidate an even more inequitable division of
wealth]{.mark}.]{.underline} Sure, men take a larger role in
child-rearing than they used to---or at least more men are proud of
announcing that they take a larger role. But that's hardly the domain
Dell had in mind when he imagined feminism as the catapult that would
allow men to risk themselves "fearlessly in the adventure of life."
Judging by the public scene, much of the [American male response to
feminism has proceeded along one of two tracks: a doubling-down on
anti-feminist political campaigns or a hunkering down into an adolescent
sulk.]{.underline} On the one hand, we have the never-ending backlash:
the war against abortion and Planned Parenthood (and now even
contraception), the stripping away of social programs that support
working mothers, the vitriol hurled at any woman with serious political
or leadership aspirations, and on and on. On the other hand, we have the
passive-aggressive, petulant displays of "adult" males with their
baseball caps turned back, the screw-you-I'll-just-be-a-boy-forever
juvenility that is the centerpiece of so many Judd Apatow films and
sniggering reiterations of Dumb and Dumber. Why hasn't feminism led to
men's liberation? Why haven't individual men taken the opportunity to be
their larger selves and run with it? No doubt, [the fact [that women
became 50 percent of the workforce]{.mark} at the very moment [when the
nation]{.mark} suffered the [worst economic crash since the Great
Depression hasn't helped]{.mark} matters.]{.underline} Nor has [the
media's eagerness to promptly declare]{.underline} this downturn the
"Great Hecession" or the "Mancession" and to harp endlessly on how
[opportunistic women were allegedly getting ahead on the broken backs of
laid-off male workers.]{.underline} (The claim was dubious: men
initially lost more jobs than women in the crash only because the
greatest early losses came in the male-dominated professions of
construction and high finance. Since then, it's women who have had the
higher unemployment rate---and a higher and record rate of poverty.) But
even factoring in media-inflamed male economic resentment, the mystery
remains. Didn't the Great Depression inspire more male radicalism? Why
not the Great Recession? Haven't hard times given men less to lose in
following women into a more liberated life? Why defend the privileges of
manhood so adamantly when those privileges are yielding so little? Men
are no longer defending entitlements they have; they are defending their
right to entitlements with no payoff. Why haven't they rebelled? Have
men settled, as Dell feared, for a faux domestic control, preferring the
easy facsimile to the hard real thing? "Men don't want the freedom that
women are thrusting upon them," he observed. "[[Men want the sense of
power more than they want the sense of freedom.]{.mark} They want the
feeling that comes to them as providers for women more than they want
the feeling that comes to them as free men. [They want some one
dependent on them more than]{.mark} they want [a
comrade]{.mark}]{.underline}." Perhaps that's why the era of feminist
gains is also the era of the trophy wife, and why the right wing's
pretend defense of "family values" seems to appeal to so many more male
than female voters. Maybe the Grand Inquisitor's disquisition on human
nature in Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov could as easily apply to
the post-feminist American male temperament: "Man is tormented by no
greater anxiety than to find someone quickly to whom he can hand over
that gift of freedom with which the ill-fated creature is born."
Assuming men wanted to be free, where would be the means and method for
their revolt? How to rebel in a time when all the old strategies for
political organizing and mobilization are corrupted or in free
fall---when electoral politics has sold its soul to the highest bidder,
when union membership has shrunk to a pinpoint, when radical movements
have the lifespans of fruit flies and the appetites of cannibals? Beyond
psychic anxieties and methodological failures, though, lies something
more---and worse. What if men have been betrayed by their own vanguard,
by the very feminist-inspired women that Dell hoped would be the force
to spring men from their imprisonment in a capitalist system? What if
American feminism, at least as it's been reconstituted in the American
popular imagination, has taken as its rallying cry the call to join men
in their prison? The hot "feminist" books of the last decade are
get-ahead-gals management texts---most famously, Lean In: Women, Work,
and the Will to Lead, which joined a bumper crop of other like-minded
entreaties to elbow your way into the executive suite: Nice Girls Don't
Get the Corner Office: 101 Unconscious Mistakes That Women Make That
Sabotage Their Careers; Play Like a Man, Win Like a Woman: What Men Know
About Success that Women Need to Learn; The Go-Getter Girl's Guide: Get
What You Want in Work and Life (and Look Great While You're at It). Or
they are celebrations of women's coming superiority in the new
"flexible" and "global" job market---most recently, The End of Men: And
the Rise of Women and The Richer Sex: How the New Majority of Female
Breadwinners Is Transforming Sex, Love, and Family---in which
exultations over women's supposedly new "earning power" slop over into
sly putdowns of those sad-sack men who failed to retool themselves for
the brave new economy. Women are "overtaking" men to become the dominant
breadwinners, Liza Mundy declares in The Richer Sex, and their
"slow-track" boyfriends need to get on board or lose their shot at
grabbing the brass---and wedding---ring: Women will take to the skies.
High-earning young women who remain determined to marry men who make as
much or more than they do will turn to more enterprising measures than
online dating. Women will use their earnings to travel far and wide,
flying from big cities to other big cities, keeping the travel industry
afloat and turning the country---the world---into one big marriage
market, one giant globally connected dating pool. Feminism has "won,"
these authors rejoice, because women are going to seize all the
fastest-growing occupations---crappy and mind-numbing though those jobs
may be---in the bright future realm of Multinational World Capitalism
Unlimited. More and more, freedom trades in capitalism's currency. And
cancels itself out in the process. As Dell warned in that 1914 essay in
The Masses, "Capitalism does not want free men." Where are the great
male revolts against corporate rule, militarism, the rat race? [The few
recent appeals by prominent women to challenge the working world are
that in name only---summonses in which feminism is proffered as a tool
to soften---very slightly---the work-till-you-drop corporate work ethic,
while leaving the corporate walls (and the sixty-hour work week) firmly
in place.]{.underline} Witness Princeton political scientist and former
State Department official Anne-Marie Slaughter's solution to the
work-family problem, showcased on the cover of The Atlantic last year.
"Women in power," Slaughter wrote, can "help change the norms" . . . by
talking in the office about their children and their desire for "a
balanced life." Or media mogul Arianna Huffington's radical proposal for
"the second women's revolution," which she recently unveiled in two
radical periodicals, the Wall Street Journal and Forbes. The revolution
would be all about improving working women's "well-being" . . . by
getting corporate workplaces to offer yoga classes, meditation areas,
and "nap rooms." For napping adults, that is; onsite child care did not
make the well-being list. (Huffington's own company, which recently
installed two nap rooms, was leading the way: "We at HuffPost launched a
free app, GPS for the Soul, to track your stress level through your
heart rate variability.") Company-sponsored "stress reduction programs,"
she maintained, would enable women to "become much better at leaning in"
and thereby help them speed their way up the corporate ladder.
