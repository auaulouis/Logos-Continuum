[Unlike many of Washington's treaty alliances from that era, the
partnership with Jerusalem is not premised on American troops serving as
tripwires on Israel's frontlines. Rather, the purpose is to work closely
together to advance shared security interests, including the United
States ensuring Israel has the tools to defend itself by itself. **The
principal threat to Israel**]{.underline} and the United States in the
Middle East no longer is the Soviet Union, which long ago collapsed, but
**[is Iran's ascending hegemony]{.underline}**. And most immediately it
is Iran's growing entrenchment in Syria and the rapidly escalating risk
of a serious IsraelIran conflict there and in Lebanon, directly and by
proxy. [Even as this threat grows, America remains wary of further
military engagement in the Middle East beyond the approaching defeat of
ISIS in Iraq and Syria, leaving Israel exposed and in need of more and
higher quality tools to defend itself and, effectively, U.S. security
interests]{.underline}. [Opportunity unfolds from the waning hostility
to Israel]{.underline} among Sunni Arab leaders and their growing
convergence of interests against Iran, ISIS and the Muslim Brotherhood,
**[and the budding of unprecedented, albeit still limited,
cooperation]{.underline}**. Still, the Israelis and most Sunni Arab
states are not, and are unlikely to become, close allies. This task
force was established under the auspices of the Jewish Institute for
National Security of America (JINSA) to examine with fresh eyes how to
update the U.S.-Israel security relationship amid dramatic regional
changes to meet growing dangers and capitalize on new opportunities.
[Others before us have articulated compelling arguments for the
fundamental importance of bilateral U.S.-Israeli cooperation, so our
mission focused instead on **concrete recommendations to expand the
mutual benefits of this partnership**]{.underline}. [In addition to our
own collective experiences as senior American military officers and
policy experts, our research was informed in part by extensive meetings
with current and former Israeli national security
officials]{.underline}. **[We believe the cornerstone of U.S. policy
toward the Middle East should be a bolstering of the U.S.-Israel
security relationshi]{.underline}**p. [Washington can and should support
its strategic partner by: elevating Israel to a top-tier ally, on par
with]{.underline} Great Britain and [Australia; frontloading the
military assistance MoU]{.underline} and prepositioning materiel [to
give Israel]{.underline} more and [higher quality tools to defend
itself]{.underline}, by itself, against the Iranian and other threats[;
facilitating expanded cooperation]{.underline} between Israel and our
Sunni Arab allies; supporting Israel's legitimate security needs against
the rapidly growing Iranian threat in Syria and Lebanon; and [investing
together in nextgeneration military technology and other new frontiers
for cooperation**. Israel has always been and remains a pivotal
strategic partner. The United States should seize the opportunity to
take greater advantage of**]{.underline} it.

#### The counterplan's planks work together to reinforce Israeli deterrence that solves the first advantage.

Washington also has a legal obligation to ensure Israel's qualitative
military edge over its neighbors. This would best [be done by
\"**frontloading**\" the **2016** **m**emorandum **o**f
**u**nderstanding under which the U.S. is providing **\$38 billion in
foreign military and missile-defense funding**, spaced evenly **over 10
years.** A fast-tracked MoU could allow Israel to **acquire a host of
weapons earlier** than initially planned to **meet growing threats**
from Iran and elsewhere. They might include **F-35** fighter-jet
squadrons; KC-46 air-refueling **tankers**;]{.underline} mobility
capabilities like V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft[; small-diameter bombs and
**Hellfire** precision munitions;]{.underline} Joint Direct Attack
Munition kits that turn unguided bombs into smart weapons[; **drones**;
and semi-submersible **naval vessels**. The U.S. should also
**replenish** Israel\'s precision **munitions** and other **critical**
wartime **stockpiles**, and consider **making Israel** a prepositioning
**base** to support American and allied operations
region-wide.]{.underline} The Pentagon should also [consider
**relocating two**]{.underline} Arleigh Burke-class
**[destroyers]{.underline}** from Rota, Spain, to a new homeport in
Haifa, Israel. [These ships, with their cutting-edge **Aegis** combat
systems, would be well positioned to **defend Europe against** an
**Iran**ian missile attack, **balance** the new **Russian naval
presence** in the Eastern Mediterranean, and **reinforce Israeli
deterrence**. The U.S. also needs to **coordinate closely with Israel**
to **support** its **ally's legitimate security interests in Syria
against Iran**ian encroachment. This will require not only deeper
intelligence sharing but **more cooperation in cyber operations and
missile defense and strike planning**.]{.underline} Finally, [Washington
should **encourage higher levels of Israeli-Arab security
cooperation**]{.underline}, acting as a hub between spokes in Riyadh and
Jerusalem, as well as Amman and Cairo. The priority should be regional
missile defense and shared early warning that synchronizes U.S., Israeli
and Arab capabilities. Cooperation is also possible against Iranian
influence on the Arabian Peninsula and Red Sea. [By **facilitating
Israel**i intelligence-sharing and operational **coordination with Saudi
Arabia and the U**nited **A**rab **E**mirates, the U.S. could enable
more **effective action against Iranian arms transfers and Hezbollah**
operations **in Yemen**]{.underline}. Much of this can occur at sea
between the Israeli, American and Arab navies. [By ensuring that Israel
can defend itself and facilitating tacit cooperation between Israel and
our Sunni Arab partners, the U.S. can **bolster the anti-Iranian
coalition**, lay the foundation for a more **stable Middle East** and
**restore** its **regional** **leadership** \-- all without putting
significant numbers of American boots on the ground.]{.underline}

### S -- Elevate to Australia

#### Elevating Israel's official standing to that of Australia bolsters the alliance.

[**Elevate** Israel's **official** standing as an **ally** to that of
Australia Israel remains one of America's closest allies]{.underline},
and confronts alone a shared Iranian threat, yet it does not have the
appropriate standing. For instance, [Israel's **current designation as a
"major non-NATO ally"**]{.underline} is a status it shares with Tunisia
and Afghanistan. Instead, the [United States **should** largely **treat
Israel as it does Britain** and Australia]{.underline}, in terms of
[**sharing signals** and other **intelligence**, **weapons technology**
and other vital information, as well as joint contingency planning and
exercising.]{.underline} [**Raising the level of the bilateral
partnership will facilitate much more effective
collaboration**,]{.underline} [enhance Israel's ability to]{.underline}
possess the capacity to confront its threats and **[defend
itself]{.underline}** by itself, and enable it to play a greater role in
**[countering Iranian aggression]{.underline}** and helping secure other
U.S. interests in the Middle East. It also [will **boost** the
**deterrence** of Israel and the United States]{.underline} by sending a
loud strategic signal that the bonds between our two countries are
stronger than ever. [1a. Improve bilateral sharing of weapons technology
and intelligence]{.underline} While the United States and Israel already
share a great deal of intelligence, to the benefit of both countries,
[we **recommend raising** Israel's information-sharing clearance to the
level enjoyed by the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and New
Zealand]{.underline}, who are signatories with the United States **[to
the "Five Eyes" agreement]{.underline}** enabling full cooperation on
signals intelligence and other highly sensitive information. While
diplomatic and policy obstacles prevent Israel joining this elite
closed-door institution, just as they do for formal U.S. allies like
Germany, there is nothing to prevent the American president from issuing
an instruction to release to Israel any intelligence that is releasable
to the Five Eyes that also pertains to Israeli security. The United
States already suffers from insufficient exchange of intelligence. For
instance, among all U.S. partners, Israel spends by far the most time on
the frontlines against our shared adversaries, learning invaluable
lessons that are directly relevant to U.S. forces in their current or
prospective missions. However, classification barriers often prevent
Israel from discussing and comparing their lessons learned with their
American counterparts. Exchanging information about Israel's experience
is crucial for the United States, precisely because the IDF is often the
first to deploy U.S. weapons systems against potential and real U.S.
adversaries. Action should be taken to lower the classification barriers
that prevent Israel from sharing and comparing with the United States
the performance of both U.S. and adversary capabilities, even when
Israel identifies malfunctions or design flaws in U.S. weapons systems.
Equally important, [Israel's **lack of top-tier ally status** can
**prevent it from accessing** the most **advanced tech**nologies for its
U.S. weapons platforms.]{.underline} This undercuts Israel's capacity to
defend itself against shared threats and should be rectified. For the
sake of efficiency and time, we recommend the issuance of an executive
order that creates a presumption of approval of sharing with Israel
information, military equipment and technology. Such an executive order
could include such language: "It is the policy of the United States to
approve sharing of information with Israel, as well as licenses and
other approvals for exports and imports of Defense Articles and Defense
Services (e.g., technology), destined for or originating in Israel,
including but not limited to those identified in the International
Traffic in Arms Regulations, (e.g., Category XI (Military Electronics)
and Category XII (Fire Control, Laser, Imaging, and Guidance Equipment)
in Section 121.1, The United States Munitions List, of Title 22, Chapter
I, Subchapter M of the Code of Federal Regulations." 1b. A [**formal
U.S.-Israel alliance**? The United States' formal alliances come from
**mutual defense treaties**, the heart of which is an **Article V
provision** committing each signatory to consider an armed attack on one
as an attack on all. The United States has such alliances with NATO,
Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Philippines, South Korea, Thailand and
most of the Americas. Yet **Israel notably is not a formal U.S.
ally**]{.underline}, despite repeated affirmations from the White House
and Congress, as well as polls continually showing the American people's
view of Israel as one of our closest partners. Israel has not sought
such an alliance, given its ethos of self-defense and insistence that it
never asks, nor intends to ask, Americans to give their lives on its
behalf. Nor do Israeli officials want their hands tied by any
expectation they would need U.S. approval for critical national security
decisions. For these and other reasons successive Israeli leaders have
demurred whenever formal alliance with the United States is proposed,
instead favoring more limited formal strategic ties. However, a mutual
defense pact does not always connote or require that each party approve
the other's strategic decisions. Nor would it mean American soldiers
would help fight Israel's wars. Rather, a mutual defense pact could
offer greater deterrence against shared threats, and would strengthen
information-sharing between the two countries' defense establishments.
Therefore, amid ongoing changes in the region, the [**time has come**
for top U.S. and Israeli officials to engage in bilateral discussions
reexamining the possibility of a stand-alone mutual security treaty
without constraints on either party's actions globally]{.underline}. 1c.
**[Upgrade Israel to "all but Article V" NATO partner]{.underline}** In
addition to a prospective mutual security treaty, the United States and
Israel [can bolster shared deterrence, joint planning and exercising by
upgrading Israel's status as a NATO partner.]{.underline} Alongside six
other Middle Eastern countries including Egypt and Jordan[, for years
Israel has coordinated with NATO on general regional security issues
through the alliance's Mediterranean Dialogue.]{.underline} Out of this
initial partnership, Israel's ties with NATO have grown steadily, and
now include counterterrorism and maritime security cooperation,
informationsharing and transfers of defense-related materials. [Given
shared threats to Israel and the alliance, and the mutual benefits that
would accrue from deepening cooperation and aligning certain IDF and
NATO procedures and equipment, the next logical step is to upgrade
Israel to an "all but Article V" NATO partner by joining the Partnership
Interoperability Initiative (PII).]{.underline} This would increase
Israel's ability to exchange intelligence and plan and conduct
operations and exercises with NATO members -- without actually becoming
a member of the alliance. It would also reinforce deterrence by
signaling that Israel is capable and willing to operate in tandem with
the combined power of the United States and much of Europe. [1d.
**Homeport two U.S. Aegis destroyers**]{.underline} in Haifa Another
step short of alliance that would [**benefit both countries** would be
**relocating two forward-deployed U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke-class
destroyers** (DDG) from Rota, Spain, **to** a new homeport in **Haifa,
Israel**. This would make their mission of **European missile defense
against Iran more executable**, balance the new Russian naval presence
in Syria, lay the groundwork for a prospective regional missile defense
network,]{.underline} reinforce Israeli deterrence and provide greater
U.S. force presence against Iran in the region. [1e**. Review
reassigning Israel from EUCOM to CENTCOM** Finally]{.underline}, the
United States should explore [shifting Israel from U.S. European
Command's (EUCOM) area of responsibility (AOR) to that of Central
Command (CENTCOM).]{.underline} Short of reassigning Israel, the United
States could consider enhancing Israel-CENTCOM cooperation on critical
issues like regional missile defense and prepositioning of weapons.
Historical animosity to Israel from the rest of the Middle East prompted
its current grouping with European countries in the Pentagon's combatant
command structure, which divides the U.S. military's global
responsibilities into unified geographical and functional commands. As
those animosities begin to soften and Israel's cooperation with its Arab
neighbors actually strengthens, the United States -- in consultation
with Israel's ministry of defense and general staff -- should review
reassigning Israel to CENTCOM. While retaining Israel in EUCOM would
allow two combatant commands to continue devoting resources to our
Middle East allies, [**moving Israel to CENTCOM**, or at the very least
creating more opportunities for cooperation, could **streamline U.S.
efforts** to foster more **collective defense** among Israel and its
Arab neighbors. Hesitation about switching Israel to CENTCOM could be
addressed by first strengthening the existing "ICE" forum
(Israel-CENTCOM-EUCOM) as a bridge to eventual Israeli inclusion in
CENTCOM.]{.underline} Most immediately, enhanced Israel-CENTCOM ties
could include missile defense coordination between Israel and its
neighbors in CENTCOM, first and foremost Jordan and Egypt. [Shifting
Israel to CENTCOM also could **simplify** the prepositioning of **U.S.
warfighting materiel** in Israel for potential operations in CENTCOM's
area of responsibility, such as against Iran. It could also provide a
platform to expedite the sharing of regional intelligence with Israel.
Processes aside, such a move would be an important public statement
reifying a growing common regional front against Tehran.]{.underline}

Have you ever suffered the embarrassment of dancing only to have the
seam of your pants break when you were trying to impress with your dance
moves. The moral of this story is that the seam is always the weakest
link, and the most likely to fail when the pressure is on. What does
this have to do with US Middle East USCENTCOM combatant command
structure? Everything! [For the US Combatant Command's Areas of
Responsibilities has been structured in such a way as to put Israel on
the **seam of three different** US Combatant **commands**. But Israel is
now the **weakest link** of the US Combatant Command instead of the
strongest link. And, **if the arch-foe of CENTCOM is Iran, Israel should
be the center** of CENTCOM's defense architecture.]{.underline} What is
the US Combatant Command? The world is broken up into various "Areas of
Responsibility" under which the various US regional commands operate and
that they are "responsible" for. For instance, US Central Command, or
CENTCOM, is responsible for the Middle East. [But, where logically
**Israel is part of the Middle East**, Israel is **attached to** US
European Command or **EUCOM**. For even more confusion, **Egypt is part
of CENTCOM** even **though it is** to the **west of Israel**. **Egypt**
is **not** part of **Africa** Command, and **neither is
Israel**.]{.underline} [Israel is **disconnected from** both
**AFRICOM**, and **CENTCOM**, and **geographically separated from
EUCOM**. Israel sits astride a triple-witching seam between EUCOM,
CENTCOM, and AFRICOM.]{.underline} Israel is, in effect, the black hole,
or orphan-child, of the US Combatant Command when it really should be
the core of the CENTCOM command structure, critically connecting to
EUCOM. The time is riipe for change. While for the last 30 years Israel
was politically hated by the Sunni Muslim countries, Israel now stands
as the pivot point hub of any effective defense against Iran. Therefore,
the time has come for the US Combatant command structure to politically
morph to meet this new reality. Nothing would put greater fear into the
Iranian ayatollahs than US CENTCOM absorbing and projecting Israel as
the key organic component of CENTCOM. [More importantly, it is **vital**
for the United States **to actively project to the Arabs** of the Levant
and Egypt that **Israel is a vital component** to the Arabs'
protection.]{.underline} More ominously, most American generals earn
their stripes through CENTCOM because that's where the action is, and
hence the promotions. Because Israel isn't in CENTCOM the fastest-rising
generals don't see Israel as America's true asset because all the Muslim
generals carp about Israel as the "problem" rather the solution. Hence,
the most successful generals tend to see Israel subjectively through the
lens of Muslim military-men complaints rather than objectively as the
sole stable lighthouse of democracy and hope. While politics strongly
argues for Israel's CENTCOM incorporation, militarily, Israel is the
heart and soul of any US defense of the Arabs against Iran. Alexander
Haig who served as the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, and US Secretary
State was famously quoted as saying, "Israel is the largest American
aircraft carrier in the world that cannot be sunk, does not carry even
one American soldier, and is located in a critical region for American
national security." Today, Israel isn't worth just one aircraft carrier,
but a dozen aircraft carriers to the US combatant command. [Israel
stands on both the north-south crossroads of the Eastern Mediterranean,
and the East-West transverse of Europe-Greece-Israel-Saudi
Arabia-Iran.]{.underline} One of the greatest historians, Barbara
Tuchman, explained in her "Bible and the Sword," that the British
purpose in helping establish the bedrock of the future Israel was: "To
Protestant England it \[Israel\] was not only, as Lord Curzon said, the
'holiest space of ground on the face of the globe,' the land of
Scriptures, the land of the Crusades, the land 'to which all our faces
are turned when we are finally laid in our graves in the churchyard." It
was also the geographical junction between East and West, the bridgehead
between three continents, the focal point in the strategy of \[the
British\] empire, the area necessary to the defense of the Suez Canal,
the road to India and the oil fields of Mosul\[and of the entire Arab
Gulf\]." However vital Israel, then-Palestine, was to the British Empire
in the early 20th Century, it is orders of magnitude more vital to the
security of the United States in the 21st Century. Therefore, in
conclusion, [the United States should **incorporate Israel directly**
into CENTCOM's Area of Responsibility]{.underline}. It's way past time
[to stop the fiction that Israel is not America's true **center of
strategic gravity** to the defense of the Middle East and our moderate
Sunni allies. The US Department of Defense's failure to truly integrate
Israel into the **defense of the Arabs from Iran** will only
significantly weaken America's defense of the Arabs.]{.underline}

### S -- Frontloading MoU

#### Frontloading the memorandum of understanding to ensure Israel's qualitative military edge allows Israel to acquire weapons to deter threats.

[**Frontload the MoU** to **ensure Israel's** qualitative military edge
**(QME)**]{.underline} The United States is [required by U.S. law since
2008 to uphold Israel's "qualitative military edge" (QME) over its
neighbors]{.underline}, which [**ensures Israel can counter** and
**defeat** real or potential **threats** at acceptable cost. The
**U**nited **S**tates **needs to supply** Israel the tools that enable
it to have the capacity to meet its current and growing
threats]{.underline}, which entails changing certain mechanisms of U.S.
defense cooperation with Israel, as well as transfers of certain U.S.
capabilities to Israel. This also [**communicates an unmistakable
deterrent** against shared rising threats]{.underline}. When the United
States decides to provide advanced weapons Arab allies, [steps should be
taken to **offset** such **arms sales with provisions** to ensure Israel
maintains its QME.]{.underline} The changing strategic situation,
especially the intensifying competition with Iran and its proxies --
most immediately, the heightening prospects for major war on Israel's
northern borders -- and augmented U.S. arms sales to its Arab allies,
necessitates accelerating the timetable for the United States to provide
weapons systems to Israel. [U.S. support for **Israeli purchases of
American weapon**s (foreign military financing, or **FMF**) is a **key
pillar of Israel's QME**. The United States should **prepare to
frontload the 2016 bilateral memorandum of understanding
(MoU)**]{.underline} -- under which the United States is set to provide
\$33 billion in FMF and \$5 billion in missile defense funding, spaced
evenly over ten years -- without adding one cent to it. [A fast-tracked
schedule could allow Israel to **acquire** a host of **weapons** to
**meet growing threats** from Iran and elsewhere]{.underline},
including: • Air-attack capabilities, prioritizing more F-35 squadrons
with F-15s and F-16s as interim options. • Mobility capabilities,
whether CH-53K and C-47 cargo helicopters or V-22 aircraft. • Adding air
refueling tankers by prioritizing KC-46s, with the interim option of
KC-135Rs (U.S. law already calls for providing aerial refueling tankers
to Israel). • Precision munitions, including GBU-39 and GBU-53/B small
diameter bombs and AGM114 Hellfire missiles, as well as additional Joint
Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) kits for unguided munitions. • Unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAV) with electronic warfare capabilities to bolster
missile defenses by jamming enemy radars and command and control. •
Semi-submersible naval vessels, specifically Alligator-class commando
craft, and amphibious landing craft to support Israeli naval and special
operations. The United States could also transfer surplus fighter and
tanker aircraft to Israel through the Excess Defense Articles (EDA)
program.

### S -- Replenish Stockpiles

#### Replenishing and regionalizing prepositioned munitions stockpiles in Israel strengthens combined readiness.

conflicts involving the United States or Israel.]{.underline} It is
critical these capabilities be interoperable between both countries,
[**enablin**g either to **draw** from the **stockpile in emergencies or
joint contingencies**.]{.underline} With [**potential operations**
against **Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas**]{.underline} -- [perhaps
simultaneously]{.underline} -- [requiring **greatly increased quantities
of air-to-ground weapons**]{.underline}, the highest restocking
priorities should be laser and GPS precision-guided munitions with full
protocols that are interoperable between the United States and Israel --
[including stocks to supplement those purchased by Israel using FMF.
Reflecting the new permanent U.S. presence in Israel, WRSA-I **should
also include stocks of critical non-surplus munition**s such as
**THAAD** and **PAC-3** interceptors **and SM-3** missiles.]{.underline}
Part of this replenishing **[could be conducted quickly by simply
relocating some existing CENTCOM regional stocks to
Israel]{.underline}**, a very secure partner country. This move would
not initially involve new U.S. financial outlays. WRSA-I should also be
[**re-envisioned from a bilateral concept into** a regional

Israel's projected wartime requirements, CENTCOM contingencies, and

and sophistication of U.S. **combined-arms firepower**. The two
countries will also need to **coordinate non-kinetic options**,
including cyber and special operations, **sanctions** and a
**counter-messaging campaign targeting Iran's** efforts to delegitimize
the U.S. **presence in Syria.**]{.underline} Wherever feasible, U.S. and
Israeli diplomats should try to reach [tactical accommodation with
Russia by exploiting Moscow's and Tehran's divergent goals in
Syria.]{.underline}

### S -- Coop / R&D

#### Developing new frontiers for bilateral military cooperation and R&D in space and other cutting-edge weapons fields ensure a military edge against Iran and other adversaries.

[Develop new frontiers for **bilateral military cooperation** and
**R&D** The United States and Israel should expand upon their
extraordinarily close collaboration in research and development (R&D) of
military technology by looking to **space**, particularly the
development of **advanced military satellites**, and other cutting-edge
fields.]{.underline} These could include: [**offensive and defensive
cyber operations**; artificial intelligence (**AI**); **directed
energy**; **hypersonic weapons**; **unmanned vehicles**; and
**counter-hybrid warfare,** including special and maritime
operations]{.underline}, particularly littoral defense of critical
infrastructure. Such ventures would [enhance Israel's defensive posture
and provide the United States advanced capabilities it might not
otherwise possess]{.underline}. Using the shared costs and benefits of
the Arrow missile defense program as a model, the [United States and
Israel should work to develop advanced capabilities and **closer
cooperation** in these areas, beginning with miniaturized, relatively
**low-cost hyperspectral satellite**s whose military importance is only
increasing in a world where enemies that were previously "easy to find,
hard to kill" are now "hard to find, easy to kill."]{.underline} The
United States and Israel should also explore [new joint ventures in
**cyberspace**, where the two countries reportedly have cooperated to
great effect alread]{.underline}y. With Iran's hegemonic ambitions
increasingly spilling into cyberspace, the [United States and Israel
should jointly develop new technology to **defend against Iranian
attempts to infiltrate sensitive networks**, and to **attack Iran's
digital vulnerabilities.**]{.underline} This naturally should [encourage
cooperation on **AI** as well. Spurring U.S.-Israeli joint R&D endeavors
in AI, particularly in the private sector, can accelerate the advances
either country could make on its own and ensure that both **maintain a
qualitative military edge over their adversaries**]{.underline}. Given
the proliferation of advanced military capabilities to Iran, its proxies
and other strategic competitors, the United States and Israel should
also [**consider deeper bilateral cooperation** on directed-energy
weapons, hypersonic and unmanned vehicles (air, ground, surface and
undersea), and capabilities germane to counter-hybrid, special and
maritime operations -- in particular littoral **defense of critical
infrastructure**.]{.underline}
