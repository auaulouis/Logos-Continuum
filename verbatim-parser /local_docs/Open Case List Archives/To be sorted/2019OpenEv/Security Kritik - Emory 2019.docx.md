### 1nc -- Security K

#### The aff attempts to limit arms to control and create security -- that leaves the apparatus of the military - and the U.S. specifically -- in control of the lives and decisions of others. That is the heart of securitized governmentality. 

Keith **Krause 11**. Professor at the Graduate Institute of
International and Development Studies in Geneva. Leashing the Dogs of
War: Arms Control from Sovereignty to Governmentality. Contemporary

[The nature, form, and objectives of contemporary arms control practices
have not been subject to systematic conceptual analysis]{.underline}.
Canvassing the academic and policy-relevant literature of the past 50
years, one can find scattered contributions to theoretically-informed
reflection about arms control, disarmament, and the overall regulation
of weapons and related technologies.1 But [there exists no real theory
or paradigm of arms control practices.2]{.underline} Within the broader
panorama of contemporary security studies, the absence of sustained and
systematic reflection on what lies behind the ideas, principles and
practices of arms control is somewhat puzzling, for at least two
reasons. First, [other fields of security studies have engaged
considerable efforts to develop]{.underline} (and critique)
[theories]{.underline} of deterrence (conventional and nuclear),
alliance theory, offence-defence balance theory, and other intellectual
offshoots of the rationalist approach to war and peace. Second, and as
Emanuel Adler pointed out in 1992, there is (or at least was) a large
epistemic community of arms control professionals engaged in sporadic or
ongoing development and negotiation of treaties or other arrangements.3
Given both of these elements, one would expect that arms control at
least would warrant as much attention as other central aspects of great
power security practices. The implications of this for our understanding
of post-Cold War arms control practices are somewhat paradoxical. On the
one hand, [the narrow focus in scholarship and practice on
w]{.underline}eapons of [m]{.underline}ass [d]{.underline}estruction
[has meant that the specific arms control efforts associated with these
weapons occupy]{.underline} today [only a small place in the wider
panoply of efforts to regulate]{.underline} the production, transfer,
possession, stockpiling, and use of [arms]{.underline}, within and
between states. On the other hand, [the]{.underline} particular way in
which arms control evolved throughout the Cold War and its [emphasis on
the rational management of the means of violence meant that the
underlying principles governing arms control efforts]{.underline}
together [generated a larger logic concerning the 'governance of
military technology'.]{.underline} [This]{.underline} article argues
that the progressive development of measures to control weapons of mass
destruction in the 1980s and 1990s essentially [moved arms
control]{.underline} beyond a sovereign conception of how (and why) to
control arms, as part of the management of security relations between
competing powers, [towards a larger logic of governmentality that
reached deep into the domestic affairs of states and involved forms of
regulation and control that went]{.underline} far beyond inter-state
agreements [to regulate their military competition]{.underline}. [The
notion of a shift]{.underline} from a sovereign [to a governmental form
of power draws upon]{.underline} Michel [Foucault\'s analysis
of]{.underline} the emergence, in the 16th and 17th centuries, of
government and [governing as the way in which state power over its
population was exercised,]{.underline} as opposed to cruder, more
direct, exercises of unlimited and/or [arbitrary sovereign
power.]{.underline}4 Sovereignty and governmentality are thus two
distinct modes of exercising power that either focus on securing a given
territory and system of rule over a people (sovereignty) or on managing
a population through the wide-ranging regulation of economy and society
(governmentality).5 \*\*\*\*\*footnote 5\*\*\*\*\* [As Foucault puts it,
governmentality is]{.underline} a form of [power]{.underline} one
central aspect of [which is the 'institutions, procedures, analyses and
reflections, calculations, and tactics ... that has the population as
its target]{.underline}, political economy as its major form of
knowledge [and apparatuses of security as its essential technical
instrument']{.underline}. Foucault, Security, Territory, Population
(note 4), p.108. \*\*\*\*\*footnote 5\*\*\*\*\* Applying these concepts,
designed to help understand the changing exercise of state power, to the
international arena is not without some challenges. In the international
arena, sovereign rule is about negotiated and strategic (in the
instrumentally-rational sense) relations between recognized equals,
whereas governmental rule involves hierarchical relations, the effacing
of the domestic-international divide, and a complex set of relationships
between states, international organizations and transnational civil
society.6 It is not my intention, however, to provide a full theoretical
exploration of these concepts, but rather to use them as a window
through which I can shine new light on the changing practices of arms
control (and perhaps international security more broadly). In the first
part of this article[, I focus on the underlying elements
of]{.underline} [the]{.underline} larger historical [process of
controlling arms, understood as a technology of social and political
control, and as a set of institutional practices designed to manage and
channel the use of violence]{.underline} [both within and between
states]{.underline}. I will then look at the way in which the Cold War
arms control paradigm represented both a shift in, and a continuity with
this historical experience by highlighting the underlying principles
that governed the Cold War arms control paradigm and its related
practices and practical manifestations. Despite some elements of
continuity with previous practices, by representing itself as a set of
instrumentally-rational techniques for managing conflict, arms control
throughout the Cold War normalized a particular set of practices as one
(or the only) proper way of dealing with what was a subset of the larger
issue of how to 'control and regulate the possession and use of the
means of violence' in social and political relations.7 In the last
section of the article, I will show how many [contemporary security
building practices that are not often thought of as arms control share
its same logic]{.underline}, [but move towards a more governmental mode
of exercising the control in arms control]{.underline},
[focussing]{.underline} as much [on institutions and individual wielders
of violence]{.underline} as on the instruments of violence themselves.
Although they break with the narrow sovereign conception of arms control
inherited from the Cold War, [they remain consistent with its logic,
attempting to subject the use of violence to the same
technical-bureaucratic and instrumental rationality that characterized
Cold War arms control practices]{.underline}, albeit with different
scope and targets, and in different geopolitical and conflict contexts.
Through some illustrative examples, I will briefly demonstrate the way
in which some [contemporary security building practices]{.underline}
[embody a similar underlying logic of social (and self-) control, in
which the goal of arms control measures is to reinforce or reassert the
state\'s legal monopoly of lethal violence]{.underline}, [to maintain
the geopolitical structure of contemporary world politics, and to spread
certain humanitarian norms of civilized warfare.]{.underline}

#### A politics of securitized governmentality guarantees extinction. 

Michael **Dillon 96**. Senior Lecturer in Politics and International
Relations at the University of Lancaster. "Politics of Security: Towards
a Political Philosophy of Continental Thought,"
[http://www.questia.com/read/103092657?title=Politics%20of%20Security:%20Towards%20a%20Political%20Philosophy%20of%20Continental%20Thought#](http://www.questia.com/read/103092657?title=Politics%20of%20Security:%20Towards%20a%20Political%20Philosophy%20of%20Continental%20Thought).

The way of sharpening and focusing this thought into a precise question
is first provided, however, by referring back to Foucault; for whom
Heidegger was the philosopher. Of all recent thinkers, Foucault was
amongst the most committed to the task of writing the history of the
present in the light of the history of philosophy as metaphysics. 4 That
is why, when first thinking about the prominence of security in modern
politics, I first found Foucault's mode of questioning so stimulating.
[There was]{.underline}, it seemed to me, [a parallel to be drawn
between what he saw the technology of disciplinary
power/knowledge]{.underline} [doing to the body]{.underline} [and what
the principle of security does to politics]{.underline}. What truths
about the human condition, he therefore prompted me to ask, are thought
to be secreted in security? What work does securing security do for and
upon us? [What power-effects issue out of the regimes of truth of
security]{.underline}? If the truth of security compels us to secure
security, why, how and where is that grounding compulsion grounded? [How
was it that seeking security became such an insistent and relentless
(inter)national preoccupation for humankind]{.underline}? What sort of
project is the pursuit of security, and how does it relate to other
modern human concerns and enterprises, such as seeking freedom and
knowledge through representative-calculative thought, technology and
subjectification? Above all, how are we to account---amongst all the
manifest contradictions of our current (inter)national [systems of
security]{.underline}: which [incarcerate rather than liberate;
radically endanger rather than make safe; and engender fear rather than
create assurance]{.underline}---for that terminal paradox of our modern
(inter)national politics of security which Foucault captured so well in
the quotation that heads this chapter. 5 [A terminal paradox which not
only subverts its own predicate of security, most
spectacularly]{.underline} [by rendering the future of terrestrial
existence conditional on the strategies and calculations of]{.underline}
its hybrid regime of [sovereignty and governmentality]{.underline}, but
[which]{.underline} also [seems to furnish a new predicate of global
life]{.underline}, a new experience in the context of which the
political has to be recovered and to which it must then address itself:
the globalisation of politics of security in the global extension of
nihilism and technology, [and the advent of the **real prospect of human
species extinction**]{.underline}.

#### The alternative is bottom-up call for radical re-thinking of the security apparatus first. Allowing the hegemon to control the flow of weapons keeps the power asymmetrical -- which makes conflicts and violence inevitable. The alternative is a necessary pre-requisite to change.

Conclusion: towards disarmament from below The preceding analysis has
attempted to demonstrate how, contrary to the impres- sion given in the
mainstream literature on arms limitation, there has in fact been a great
deal of disarmament - at least in the terms understood in the
disarmament negotiations of the 1950s and 60s. Yet these very successes
have been coopted by arms controllers in ways that function to
delegitimise disarmament as Utopian and appear to confirm realist
representations of a world system with limited potential for
transformation. This article has also demonstrated the way in which
global civil society has been able to set an apparently more radical,
new arms limitation agenda for the new wars - one in particular which
has emphasised human and economic security rather than state and
military security. These factors then, represent a basis for optimism
about the future prospects for further disarmament. However, it is also
the case that the [contemporary disarm]{.underline}ament
[and]{.underline} broader [arms limitation]{.underline} system
[is]{.underline} a [highly asymmetric]{.underline} one [geared to
preserving the military hegemony]{.underline} [of the US and its
allies]{.underline}. Moreover, [even the new arms limitation agenda is
characterised by its own asymmetries]{.underline}. In particular, civil
society has manifestly failed to gain the same level of influence over
core military security issues - for example, NBC or the trade in major
conventional weapons that keeps Western defence industries viable. In
some respects then, this analysis shares certain commo- nalities with
offensive realist critiques that emphasise the problematic nature of
arms control theory (albeit from a different standpoint) and the
supremacy of politics and power in determining the possibilities for the
control of arms.86 [One response]{.underline}, therefore, [might be to
adopt a similar attitude of resigned cynicism]{.underline} in the face
of the overwhelming influence of power and interest in shaping discourse
and practice - and to conclude that a truly emancipatory, as opposed to
asymmetric, disarmament agenda is unrealisable. **[However, there are
both material and ideational factors immanent in the contemporary
international system that suggest a politics of radical emancipatory
disarmament can be constituted]{.underline}**. [**First**, the success
of existing disarmament initiatives]{.underline} - albeit under
asymmetry - [highlights the real-world relevance]{.underline} of
disarma- ment proposals still dismissed as failed and Utopian. [This
illustrates the potential for a more radical disarmament
agenda]{.underline} to be realised [by simultaneously deconstructing
hegemonic framings of the arms limitation problem and developing
alternative narratives that contain inherently transformatory
meanings]{.underline} - a powerful political act in itself.
**[Second]{.underline}**, the influential role of global civil society
in new arms limitation suggests [the possibility of a truly progressive
practice of arms limitation - a kind of disarmament from
below]{.underline}.87 In particular, [campaigns such as those on
landmines or conflict diamonds demonstrate the]{.underline} (as yet
unfulfilled) [potential for networked and adaptive rhizomatic
movements]{.underline} to envision and realise radical alternative
security futures. This is not to deny the significant power
differentials that exist between states and civil society movements that
may themselves have different goals. However, the flexibility of such
movements contrasts sharply with the rigid and sclerotic statist
institutions most immediately geared to dealing with the diplomacy of
arms limitation. Moreover, at their optimal, [such swarming resistances
to hegemony have the potential to exploit the uncontrollable spaces and
flows of a networked information age]{.underline}88 to generate focused
policy goals and shared understandings; to generate political and
cultural power by exploiting global media tropes (Princess Diana as
beatified saint opposed to landmines) or creating their own (diamonds as
blood diamonds);89 [to challenge both the threat discourses that
underpin the arms dynamic and the counsels of despair in the face of
anarchy and a supposed military technological imperative that lie at the
heart of arms control theory; and to thus effect change by eroding the
legitimacy of institutions and actors upholding
militarism]{.underline}.90 Moreover, **[such movements have the
potential to resolve the perennial debate over what has to come first
before disarmament is realised - radical reduction of armaments or
radical political change]{.underline}**. [The inevitable corollary of
the emergence of such rhizomatic social movements]{.underline} **[is
that the very act of campaigning for a radical disarmament
agenda]{.underline}** [presages radical change in the nature of
local-global politics - the one brings the other into being, and vice
versa]{.underline}. **[Third]{.underline}**, it might also be argued
that this is precisely the wrong time to articulate a new disarmament
agenda, particularly given the imperatives of the \'war on terror\'.
However, [to the extent that the threat of \'WMD\' terrorism is rooted
in material conditions, the safest response is to eliminate the very
weaponry that might be utilised]{.underline} - to move, if you like,
from a policy that aims to prevent loose nukes to a policy that aims
simply to lose nukes. Furthermore, rather than being an inopportune
moment to pursue a radical disarmament agenda, [it is clear that we are
now facing a range of new and old arms limitation challenges that will
require a radically different kind of arms regulation.]{.underline}
These include challenges such as the growing pressure to weaponise
space, the military potential of the new biology, the weapon- isation of
nanotechnology and the challenge of controlling the military uses of
cyberspace. A further challenge is that presented by the growing
importance of dual-use technology for the military. This has been
compounded by the simultaneous concentration and globalised integration
of the defence industry in a largely Western-dominated hub and spoke
model characterised by the erosion of defence industrial national
identities and increased intra-firm movement of technology and
knowledge.91 Finally, there is the problem presented by the extension
and intensifi-cation of illicit global arms networks that exploit porous
borders, corrupt officials, lax regulation and the mechanisms of
globalisation to move arms to conflict zones.92 The corollary of all
this is that **[traditional, supply-side]{.underline}**
non-proliferation [initiatives based around the ability of]{.underline}
hermetic [**nation-states to supervise the physical move- ment of
military technology will inevitably be subject to declining
utility**.]{.underline} Such developments then, are likely to require a
qualitative step-shift in the application of end-use monitoring and the
kind of intrusive verification of civil industries dealing with dual-use
technologies presaged in the CWC; the innovative adaptation of existing
arms limitation methodologies adopted by recipients and the
peripheries - such as the extension of nuclear weapons-free zones to
incorporate bans on other military technologies, or the greater use of
moratoria/bans on arms imports; and an enhanced role for local-global
civil society as presaged by the role of NGOs in monitoring
implementation of the landmines treaty. [In sum, if the challenge of
controlling contemporary military technology is to be addressed
effectively]{.underline} (and it may not be, of course), then the new
arms limitation agenda of the current era is likely to represent merely
a half-way house towards a radically novel practice of arms limitation.
[This will entail a move away from control primarily based on physical
management of objects]{.underline} ([finished weapons, national
militaries) and their accumulation and movement within or across
borders]{.underline}. Instead, current trends will require a shift to a
form of oversight and limitation characterised by swarming.93 Such an
approach will focus far more on dual-use technologies and thus intrude
into the very warp and weft of socioeconomic life. **[It will be marked
by a move from the asymmetry of hegemon/supplier-dominated control and
non- proliferation instruments and imply a far greater role for
recipients and the peripheries]{.underline}**. It will require such a
qualitative intensification and expansion of the network of arms
limitation practices that this in itself will constitute a radically
novel approach to arms limitation. And it will require the interactive,
interpenetrated agency of multiple institutions and actors from states,
multilateral institutions, NGOs, industry, media, epistemic communities
and society generally.

### Limiting Arms Sales Bad

#### Limiting arms props up asymmetric system -- risks the conflicts it hopes to solve -- only results in feelings of security.

Neil **Cooper 06**. Professor of International Relations and Security
Studies and Head of Peace Studies & International Development, The
University of Bradford. \"Putting disarmament back in the frame.\"

This also has profound implications for the supposed distinction between
arms control and disarmament around which arms control theory is based.
Once we move from framing (successful) partial disarmament as merely one
variant of arms control, and instead frame both GCD and partial
disarmament as variants of disarmament practice; once we understand
disarmament as an activity that is advocated by both Utopians and
hyper-realists alike (albeit in different ways) then both the empirical
and philosophical distinctions between arms control and disarmament fall
away. As will be noted below, this implies that [we need to develop an
alternative way of conceptualising the different strategies]{.underline}
of arms limitation and the structure of the contemporary arms limitation
system. However, [whilst it is important]{.underline} (if only to
counter the pessimistic discourse surrounding this issue) [to
recognise]{.underline} the [various disarmament outcomes]{.underline}
that [have been generated]{.underline} under the current arms limitation
system, [it is]{.underline} also [important to recognise the context in
which these have occurred]{.underline}. In particular, [both disarmament
and]{.underline} broader [arms limitation initiatives are]{.underline}
now [taking place as part of an asymmetrical arms limitation system that
has replaced the emphasis on balance between the superpowers
t]{.underline}hat dominated Cold War practice.34 [It is
sufficient]{.underline} at this juncture [to note that what
characterises]{.underline} this system of [arms limitation]{.underline}
[is the way in which it is structured to consolidate and preserve the
military superiority of the US in particular]{.underline} and the West
in general. Moreover, **[rather than reinforcing security this profound
military imbalance promotes insecurity]{.underline}** - both [by
creating incentives for other actors to pursue asymmetric
technologies]{.underline} (NBC) [or strategies (terrorism) that offset
the US\'s conventional superiority]{.underline},35 [and by diverting
resources that could be expended on human security to militarism**. At
best,**]{.underline} the contemporary [arms limitation]{.underline}
system [aims to keep the lid on such contradictions by setting in place
a variety of disciplinary mechanisms that attempt to constrain
asymmetric military responses whilst simultaneously preserving the
asymmetrical advantages of the West]{.underline}. [At worst, in
attempting to contain pressures]{.underline} that may ultimately be
uncontainable, the contemporary [arms limitation]{.underline} system
**[may promote an illusion of relative security whilst positively
fostering a variety of insecurities]{.underline}**. However, a few more
comments are in order before we proceed to consider this system of
asymmetrical arms limitation in more

#### Yes, the plan is an example of arms control -- it's an extension of the Cold War logic of big treaties -- it's an example of state control over the means of violence

Keith **Krause 11**. Professor at the Graduate Institute of
International and Development Studies in Geneva. Leashing the Dogs of
War: Arms Control from Sovereignty to Governmentality. Contemporary

Maintaining the Monopoly over the Use of Force As argued above, [one
element of the sovereign vision of arms control was the establishment of
an effective monopoly of the legitimate use of violence for the
state,]{.underline} [designed to remove challenges and threats to
the]{.underline} Weberian [state\'s legal (and practical) monopoly on
the use of force]{.underline}. [This can most clearly be seen in
the]{.underline} early modern [struggle to]{.underline} outlaw the use
of force by what we would now call Non-State Armed Groups (NSAGs), and
to [regulate the circulation and use of weapons within states to
eliminate threats to effective state power.]{.underline} But the main
thrust of the Cold War arms control paradigm was that the Weberian
state\'s monopoly over the use of lethal force could not only be used to
impose order domestically and to create social peace, but also projected
outwards to create a form of international order that reduced the risk
of violence between states. As such, negotiated agreements throughout
the Cold War to limit the quantities or disposition of weapons systems
between competing states or blocs partook of the logic of sovereign
rule. But -- and [as reflected in the NPT -- arms control was also
designed to maintain the global geopolitical hierarchy of states (and of
patron-client relations).]{.underline} Similar efforts can be found in
the Washington and London Naval treaties, which created (or codified) a
short-lived global naval hierarchy anchored around a 5:5:3 ratio of
British, American, and Japanese naval power.50 The sovereign logic of
the states system limited, however, the extent to which powerful states
could impose these terms on emerging states, as reflected in the
repeated incantations of the right of self-defence by Southern states
(which implies in their eyes a right to acquire weapons), and their
general opposition to restrictions on the arms trade that might hinder
their ability to arm themselves. But [from a logic of
governmentality]{.underline}, however, [one important
subtext]{.underline} of Cold War arms control **[was a concentration on
technology transfers,]{.underline}** [and how military technology itself
was conceived as a sphere for regulation and means to maintain a stable
global hierarchy of haves and have-nots.]{.underline}51 [Such
governmentality concerns are evident in the shift]{.underline} in the
late 1990s [from non-proliferation]{.underline} to what was called
counter-proliferation, and to the advent of the doctrine of preemptive
war as used against Iraq and justified in terms of proliferation
risks.52 [The inward gaze of the Weberian state is also part of this
logic, and is reflected in efforts by the international community to
right size national armed forces in post-conflict or post-transition
settings, and the concern]{.underline} in some circles [with exports of
weapons and technologies]{.underline} that could be used for repression
and in violation of human rights norms and laws. The principal concern
of the Arms Trade Treaty preparatory work and negotiations, for example,
was that weapons 'shipments appear in countries with dismal human rights
records or where they exacerbate conflict or facilitate repression'.
Only one aspect of that could be considered within the conventional
concern of arms control (exacerbate conflict), and even here conflict is
usually understood more broadly than just inter-state or civil war.53 In
its maximalist version, this involves oversight and regulation of the
entire national security apparatus in the name of creating or
maintaining domestic, regional, and international order. Recent and
current examples include training and re-arming programmes in Liberia,
Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Iraq, and (more controversially) South
Sudan.54 [This logic of governmentality is seldom]{.underline} (if ever)
[part of an emancipatory project that would involve bottom-up
initiative]{.underline}s such as gun-free cities or the provision of
citizen security, [but is more often about simultaneously asserting
state powe]{.underline}r over its citizens [and establishing sufficient
restraints]{.underline} on this [to make its exercise acceptable and
legitimate.]{.underline} Conclusions: Sovereignty, Governmentality and
Weapons of War This article has tried to situate the evolution of
contemporary [arms control practices]{.underline} against a broader
historical backdrop, and to demonstrate how these practices [have
evolved]{.underline} from a sovereign perspective (understood as
maintaining a particular kind of global and domestic political order)
[towards a governmentality perspective]{.underline}, [through
which]{.underline} the political economy of violence within and between
[societies and populations is managed]{.underline}. Post-Cold War arms
control practices demonstrate elements of both systems of rule, in the
(sovereign) emphasis on maintaining a hierarchical ordering of global
politics through efforts at non-proliferation, counter-proliferation and
restrictions on technology transfers; as well as [a governmentalizing
emphasis on regulating the place and scope of armed violence in
contemporary political life]{.underline} through humanitarian
disarmament and such practices as DDR and SSR. [The narrow,]{.underline}
sovereign, [vision of arms control]{.underline} (legally-binding
treaties negotiated between states) that [dominated throughout the Cold
War was]{.underline} largely only [about one form of
violence]{.underline}: that perpetrated between states. It was also part
of the logic of the national security state, and arms control and
deterrence (or military strategy writ large) were twinned and
inseparable. From this perspective, 'arms control was a stepchild of the
Cold War', and the 21st century arms control agenda is thus relatively
limited in scope to the fulfilment of unfinished business, and the
extension of particular agreements to other regions where possible.55
[But this narrow perspective fails to understand that arms control
practices can be]{.underline} potentially [both/either a manifestation
of sovereign rule, and/or a form of governmentality]{.underline}. [Arms
control]{.underline} is not just the regulation and control of
particular technological artifacts (weapons), but [can]{.underline} also
**[represent a form of rule, and a technology of control that can be
used to reshape state-society relations on the Weberian model, and that
can reach deep into the state through various forms of surveillance and
control over the political economy of violence.]{.underline}** In the
contemporary world, just as during the Cold War, it is thus part of a
broader set of techniques for managing the use of force. [Understanding
the contemporary discourse and practice of arms control]{.underline}
itself [as a technology of social control to maintain particular forms
of rule at all levels of social life]{.underline} -- from the
inter-national to the local and community level -- [does provide a way
to integrate disparate initiatives and efforts into an 'arms control
paradigm]{.underline} for the 21st [century'. Such a paradigm can
encompass the basic level at which inter-state arms control measures
order and secure global political relationships]{.underline}, and the
higher-order concern with where the regulation of the use of force and
violence is located or lodged in social, political and economic life.
Although [still fraught with the same intellectual and practical
tensions as Cold War arms control practices]{.underline}, this larger
perspective allows us better to understand how [arms
control]{.underline} is [part of the broader process of
constructing]{.underline} strong, stable, and [legitimate
states]{.underline} [that provide security]{.underline} to their
citizens [through the regulation of violence]{.underline} within and

### Focus on Arms Sales

#### focus on limiting arms locks in power politics and incentivizes asymmetric systems of warfare -- only a politics that prioritizes 'human security' first can change the system.

Review of International Studies 32.2 (2006): 353-376.

This article aims to examine both arms control theory and practice from
a [critical security studies perspective]{.underline}. It
[is]{.underline} therefore [concerned]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
[deconstruct the mainstream discourse on arms control]{.underline} in
order [to illuminate the interests that underpin received
wisdom]{.underline} on the issue; [to outline the structures of power
established by current practice]{.underline}; to highlight the
emancipatory potential immanent in contemporary approaches to arms
limitation [and]{.underline} to **[consider how these might be extended
to build a system of \'disarmament from below]{.underline}**.1 First, I
will suggest that the supposed distinctions between arms control and
disarmament that lie at the heart of arms control theory represent the
mirage- creation of a dominant disciplinary discourse. I will also argue
that Stuart Croft\'s attempt [to reinvent arms control]{.underline} for
the post-Cold War era has produced a teleological history that [ignores
the extent to which]{.underline} the development of [arms
limitation]{.underline} has been non-linear and which [downplays the
role of power in shaping discourse and practice]{.underline}. Second, I
suggest that - in contrast to the impression created by an increasingly
pessimistic literature on the topic - [the world]{.underline} is not
only experiencing a lot of arms limitation, but that it [is]{.underline}
also [experiencing]{.underline} a [significant]{.underline} amount of
[disarmament]{.underline}, particularly when judged against the goals
elucidated in the disarmament negotia- tions of the 1950s and 60s.
Furthermore, I will suggest that this point is largely ignored in the
mainstream literature on arms control, which still persists in
\'imagining\' disarmament as a failure. Such a framing acts as a
powerful tool of delegitimisation that means proposals for more
far-reaching and emancipatory forms of disarmament arrive still-born
into the Zeitgeist of IR academia and global society more generally.
Whilst in some ways depressing, such an analysis nevertheless implies
that disarmament utopias may well be realisable. However, I will also
suggest that the current disarmament and broader **[arms
limitation]{.underline}** system **[is]{.underline}**, to a significant
extent, **[an asymmetric one,]{.underline}** **[designed to preserve the
military hegemony of the US]{.underline}** in particular **[and the
West]{.underline}** in general. On the one hand therefore, we can now be
said to live in a disarmament system of sorts, but [its configuration is
one primarily shaped in the interests of a disarmament empire - the
USA]{.underline}. Ironically therefore, [the]{.underline} current
disarmament [system is one that]{.underline} nevertheless
[legitimises]{.underline} significant levels of global - and
particularly [US - military expenditure and]{.underline} which [serves
to further embed both the military supremacy of the USA and the stark
disparities]{.underline} that exist **[between spending on armaments
compared with spending on human security]{.underline}**. Moreover, [the
very asymmetry]{.underline} in military power that the current arms
limitation system is designed to shore up actually [creates an incentive
for weaker nations to pursue non-conventional military technologies
or]{.underline} strategies ([NBC weapons/ terrorism) as a way of
offsetting their]{.underline} marked [inferiority]{.underline} in
conventional weaponry. Finally, I will suggest that whilst the
influences maintaining this system are certainly very strong, practices
immanent in the contemporary arms limitation system and the challenges
presented to it by emerging military technologies suggest that **[a more
emancipatory system of \'disarmament from below\']{.underline}** - one
[geared]{.underline} less to the preserva-tion of hegemony and more [to
the promotion of human security - may be realisable]{.underline}.

### AT: Decreasing Sales Solves

#### Decreasing sales only increases market power -- denying weapons will just drive up prices

Conventional Weapons: The Virtues of an Uncompetitive Market. Carnegie
Council for Ethics & International Affairs, 31, no 4 (2017), pp 401-418.

So far this essay has shown the pressures that most arms manufacturing
countries feel to export abroad. It has described a growing market with
increasing competition among potential suppliers. Finally, it has
detailed how often most states export to corrupt governments that abuse
human rights, as well as to those seeking to develop their own export
capacity, further fueling proliferation. The question now is: [What can
be done to slow the rise in arms transfers?]{.underline} The products
produced by the "merchants of death" have traditionally been considered
one of the great menaces of international life.29 Yet, from the Second
Council of the Lateran prohibition on crossbow use against Christians to
Tsar Nicholas II's calling of the 1899 Hague Convention, efforts to
control the spread and use of weapons have been sporadic and largely
ineffective.30 In the aftermath of World War I the arms industry
received a great deal of blame for fueling the global slaughter, and
disarmament underpinned the establishment first of the League of Nations
and then, after World War II, the United Nations. The results of such
institutional responses speak for themselves. Nonetheless, [there exists
an order in the global exchange of weapons. It rests]{.underline} not on
multilateral compacts among sovereign states but [on the self-centered
actions of one powerful market-maker]{.underline}. The unique economics
of [weapons production]{.underline}---substantial and rising fixed costs
and potential for "network effects"--- [creates an environment favorable
to a monopoly]{.underline}, and the United States can fill that role, as
Ethan Kapstein laid out in 1994. 33 **[The traditional practice of a
monopolist is to restrict supply]{.underline}**, [causing prices to rise
and profits to soar]{.underline}. These profits, known to economists as
"rent," are generally financial in the world of commercial firms.
Economists and regulators generally consider rent a social ill, as it
comes at the expense of the consumer welfare arising from a more
competitive market. But [in a world of states, where the product
is]{.underline} advanced [weaponry, a reduction in]{.underline} the
[supply]{.underline}, [and thus a rise in prices, is a market
distortion]{.underline} akin to a "sin tax." Rent can have a benign
effect. Moreover, [instead of collecting]{.underline} this [rent in the
form of additional financial gains, the United States collects some of
it in terms of political influence]{.underline}: [**restricting the
supply** of tech]{.underline}nology, **[cutting off some]{.underline}**
(but certainly not all) of the most odious regimes, enforcing stringent
anti-corruption rules, and even occasionally encouraging the observance
of human rights norms. [**The consequent reduction**]{.underline} in the
ills associated with a competitive arms trade **[does not result because
the United States is a benign power; it is simply pursuing its own
interests]{.underline}**. But many of the interests it chooses to pursue
remain aspirational for other states. As much as, or even more than, the
United States, countries such as Canada or Sweden desire both a healthy
defense industry and a reputation for international do-gooding.
Unfortunately, they cannot afford both.32 Historically, the United
States has foregone exporting its highest-capability weapons to a region
until a viable competing product emerges; for example, refusing to
deliver Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) to Asian
states until China purchased the Russian equivalent R-77 (dubbed the
"AMRAAM-ski").33 [The United States can also afford to cut off clients
over policy differences]{.underline}, as it did when it crippled India's
Tejas light combat aircraft program with sanctions in 1998 following
that country's testing of nuclear weapons. [U.S. policy explicitly links
its market dominance]{.underline} of high-end weapons [to a practice of
"unilateral restraint" in its sales]{.underline}.34 **[Not selling
weapons]{.underline}** to a regime [is]{.underline} only [one of the
ways the United States exercises its market power to advance its
political goals.]{.underline} U.S. weapons that are deemed exportable
but sensitive---which includes major weapons but also "man-portable air
defense missiles, cryptographic equipment, precise geo-locational
positioning technologies, and airborne early warning and control
systems" 35---are sold almost exclusively through the Foreign Military
Sales (FMS) program, rather than through the somewhat less regulated
"direct commercial sales" (DCS) route.36 With very few exceptions, all
weapons purchased through U.S. foreign aid are also processed through
this mechanism.37 Indeed, FMS is an unheralded counterproliferation
program that also makes corruption relatively hard, as clients pay the
same price as the United States military (plus 3.5 percent
administration costs), and most of the contracting is handled by the
Department of Defense. For U.S. arms deliveries from 2011 to 2015, FMS
handled 76 percent of the financial value.38

### AT: Plan challenges Militarism

#### US export changes don't change reality -- markets mean they will be filled in

The above [evidence does not prove that the United States causes good
behavior by its arms export policies]{.underline}. Countries that import
weapons in appreciable amounts and meet high transparency and human
rights standards tend to be (a) rich enough to buy the sophisticated
weapons in which the United States specializes and (b) allied with the
United States. Rather, [the data show that,]{.underline} relative to any
other state, [the United States does not need its exports
to]{.underline} problematic regimes [to underpin the health of its arms
industry]{.underline}. Moreover, any effort by second-tier states to
increase their own exports will likely rely on regimes with high
potential for corruption and human rights abuses. [Egypt]{.underline},
under limited U.S. sanctions after its 2013 coup and subsequent human
rights abuses, [starkly illustrates the behavior that a competitive arms
market encourages]{.underline} in second-tier arms producers. While the
U.S. response was fairly tepid, [the United States did
place]{.underline} real [restrictions on arms transfers]{.underline} to
the al-Sisi regime, delaying F-16 and other major platform deliveries
and postponing military exercises.21 The Obama administration announced
that future Foreign Military Financing grants (of which Egypt is one of
the largest recipients) may only be used to purchase new equipment
specifically for counterterrorism, border and maritime security, and for
patrolling Sinai. [Other states quickly attempted to fill this
gap]{.underline}. In 2014, [Russia signed a]{.underline}
multibillion-dollar [deal to supply attack helicopters]{.underline} and
MiG-29 fighter aircraft to Egypt. [France off-loaded Mistral helicopter
carriers]{.underline} (originally intended for Russia but embargoed
after the invasion of Crimea), sold four corvettes and a frigate, and
propped up its Rafale fighter production line by making that plane's
first export sale to Egypt. Germany agreed to supply two submarines to
the Egyptian Navy in 2011 and two more in 2014. Overall, the export
agreements of major European sellers to Egypt have gone up
forty-seven-fold over the previous period.22 A blistering Amnesty
International report calls out nearly half of the European Union member
states for "flouting" an EU-wide suspension of arms transfers to
Egypt.23 [A competitive market not only encourages dealings with
problematic buyers but also creates pressure for technology
transfer]{.underline}. Indeed, [the reluctance of the United
States]{.underline} [to export weapons production know-how means that
technology transfer is a key competitive advantage]{.underline}, indeed
a necessity, for even as sophisticated an exporter as France.24 Turkey
has methodically played European, Chinese, and Russian long-range air
and anti-missile defense systems against each other in a bid not just to
lower the price tag but especially to acquire advanced technology. The
U.S.-made Patriot system was eliminated from consideration because most
of its technology would not be given to Turkey. In announcing the deal
with Russia, Turkey's presidential spokesman was frank: "Let's say the
price difference could have been manageable. But the issue of technology
transfer was more important. On this issue, our allies, including the
United States, caused a big disappointment."25 Turkey explicitly seeks
to enter the top echelon of arms exporters, and understands it needs
foreign technology to do so.26 Should it fail, like so many aspiring
exporters do, it will have consumed enormous amounts of the country's
resources to produce a product that could be bought easily from any
number of existing producers. Should it succeed, it will join a very
crowded field. Growing competition will lead to more proliferation,
fewer scruples about corruption and human rights, and generous amounts
of technology transfer to clients. The consequences of a desperate
Russia's freewheeling export policies in the 1990s and early 2000s
clearly helped fuel China's own increasingly successful international
sales push.27 Finally, transferring technology and production to the
client can hinder human rights and anti-corruption efforts in more
direct ways. For example, shifting production of sensitive components to
third-party countries has allowed German defense firms to skirt their
home country's export regulations.28 [And the entry of desperate
second-tier suppliers shapes U.S. behavior in turn. The presence of
alternate sources, also known as the "gray threat," has an
effect]{.underline} even on the United States, [as shown by the recent
U.S. decision to resume military aid and most sales to
Egypt.]{.underline} Thailand presents a similar example. [The United
States, the Thai military's traditional supplier, largely ceased both
arms sales and military assistance after that country's]{.underline}
2014 [coup]{.underline}. [Thailand accordingly procured weapons
from]{.underline} relatively new suppliers, such as [China, Russia, and
Ukraine]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} has [strengthened ties
with]{.underline} suppliers from Israel, Sweden, and [other
countries]{.underline} in Europe. [The United States is now
resuming]{.underline} much of its [sales]{.underline} to that country.

### Arms Control Link

#### Arms control maintains governmental control

Keith **Krause 11**. Professor at the Graduate Institute of
International and Development Studies in Geneva. Leashing the Dogs of

[The neo-colonialist and political implications of pushing the problem
of war to the periphery are of course clear]{.underline}, and one could
argue that the arms control paradigm sketched above, especially the
treaties that stabilized the nuclear confrontation between East and West
(SALT I and II), made certain kinds of proxy wars more possible or
acceptable by creating escalatory fire-breaks that facilitated the
relatively risk-free provision of military assistance to client states
and movements. These fire breaks were easier to create in the global
South, where American and Russian troops managed to avoid confronting
each other directly, but less easy to create in Europe. The history of
attempts to achieve mutual and balanced force reductions (the 1975 name
for what in the late 1980s became the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE
Treaty), and of debates over the necessity for intermediate range and
tactical nuclear weapons in Europe, and the problem of extended
deterrence (or the nuclear umbrella) all point towards a set of tensions
or contradictions within the logic of arms control. It is not the place
of this article to demonstrate in detail how these four understandings
or elements of the arms control paradigm were instantiated in particular
Cold War arms control practices (treaties and negotiations). [It
is]{.underline} reasonably [clear]{.underline}, however,
[that]{.underline} such [things as the]{.underline} nuclear
non-proliferation treaty ([NPT]{.underline}), which enshrined the
nuclear supremacy of the permanent five members of the UN Security
Council, [or]{.underline} the logic of the nuclear strategy of Mutual
Assured Destruction ([MAD), or]{.underline} the NATO doctrine of [first
use]{.underline} of nuclear weapons, or the lack of any meaningful
restraint on technological innovation for nuclear weapons and delivery
systems, [rested upon a deep faith in the ability of the]{.underline}
Weberian [state to regulate and]{.underline} [control the use of
violence]{.underline}. Some scholars and analysts went so far as to
argue that the possession of nuclear weapons imposed -- as a sort of
structural constraint -- a strong form of rationality on state
behaviour.29 [Arms control efforts were simply one part of this larger
logic]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} in any event [were not designed to
threaten or undermine it]{.underline}. [They were]{.underline}, in
short, [a clear expression of a Foucauldian form of sovereign rule that
reinforced the system of rule of the contemporary state
system]{.underline}.

#### Focus on weapons ignores structural violence -- kills far more people

Towards Human Security For quite some time now, the concept of human
security has identified the necessity of a new development paradigm
which puts people at the center of development. In 1994, the UNDP Human
Development Report reflected this: \"For too long, the concept of
security has been shaped by the potential for conflict between states.
For too long, security has been equated with the threats to national
borders. [For too long, nations have sought arms to protect their
security.]{.underline} [However, the majority of people today experience
insecurity more from worries about daily food and susbsistence that from
the dread of a cataclysmic world event. Job security, environmental
security, security from crime, these are emerging concerns of human
security all over the world]{.underline}.\"(38) [Throughout the 90s new
issues of \'insecurity\" have emerged]{.underline} globally and a major
impact of the Asian economic crisis of 1997 was the sense of insecurity
caused by the runaway growth and spread of global capital flows (39)
[and the consequent devastating effects on millions of
people.]{.underline} [Human security was again put forward in the debate
after the September 11 attacks]{.underline}: \"[The cost of failing to
advance human security and to eliminate the fertile ground upon which
terrorism thrives is already escalating.]{.underline} Since September
11, we know that [sophisticated weapons offer little protection against
those who are out to seek vengeance,]{.underline} at any cost, for real
and perceived wrongs. [Unless our priorities change, the threat is
certain to keep rising in the coming years.]{.underline} But first, we
must all understand that in the end, [weapons]{.underline} alone [cannot
buy us a lasting peace]{.underline} in a world of extreme inequality,
injustice, and deprivation for billions of our fellow human
beings.\"(40) However, the September 11 debates put almost exclusive
emphasis on military and repressive solutions. [The US led war against
terrorism prevailed over a well thought-out plan to counter terrorism
and further marginalised Human Security discourse and
initiatives.]{.underline}

### Free Trade Links

#### Free trade spreads militarism and violence

"STRUCTURAL VIOLENCE AS A FORM OF GENOCIDE THE IMPACT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORDER", PDF

The Impact of Globalization IMF/World Bank stabilization and struc­ tural
adjustment programmes have consist­ ently advocated and implemented essen­
tially the same package of pro­market policies throughout the world,
designed fun­ damentally to allow debtor nations to per­ petually service
their ever­expanding debt. Essentially, these programmes foster an in­
creased "outward orientation", involving for example "devaluation,
[trade liberalization]{.underline} and incentives for exporters" ­
[policies]{.underline} that "[are widely believed to lead to social hard­
ships, increased inequality]{.underline} of income distri­ bution
[and]{.underline} increased [poverty]{.underline}" (Singer, 1995). The
focus of these policies, then, is not poverty alleviation, but economic
re­ structuring conducive to the expansion and concentration of capital
(see Appendix A). Thus, [the logic of market economics tends **towards a
form of market imperialism, in which key agential entities like the
World Bank are cognizant of -- but simultaneously indifferent to ­ the
devastating impact of their policies on victim
populations**]{.underline} (see Ap­ pendix B). As former US Federal
Reserve Board economist Martin Wolfson observes, when the IMF loans
funds to alleviate a growing economic crisis -- such as in Asia -- the
funds are intended to allow Asian bor­ rowers to repay capital investors.
Mean­ while, further IMF austerity measures such as continued
deregulation and slow­growth policies are designed "restore the 'confid­
ence' of investors and to make it again prof­ itable for them to return."
In other words, [market economics is consistently focused "on restoring
the investments of the wealthy, not on helping the people]{.underline}"
(Wolf­ son, 1998). **[The people are simply irrelevant to the
equation.]{.underline}** Africa provides an illuminating case­in­ point.
Naiman and Watkins (1999) heavily critique [the impact of IMF
interventions]{.underline} in Africa based largely on the IMF's own
data. They document that less developed coun­ tries (LDCs) worldwide
participating in the IMF's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Fa­ cility
(ESAF) programmes [have experienced lower economic growth, and even
drastic declines in per capita income, compared to those outside these
programmes]{.underline}. Although [increasing numbers of millions of
Africans are suffering due to lack of appropriate health, education and
sanitary facilities, the IMF is forcing African countries to further
decrease public spending on such services, including a long­term decline
in such spend­ ing between 1986 and 1996. External debt has also
escalated exponentially.]{.underline} In sub­ Saharan Africa, for
instance, debt rose as a share of GDP from 58% in 1988 to 70% in 1996.
This has had tangibly devastating results for the African population.
According to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO, 1996), between
1985 and 1990, **[under the policies of the global economic regime, the
number of people living in poverty in sub­ Saharan Africa increased from
184 to 216 million.]{.underline}** By 1990, 204 million people suffered
from malnutrition -- a situation that is drastically worse off than the
previous 30 years. Indeed, the proportion of Africa's population living
on less than a dollar a day increased from approximately 18% in 1980 to
24% in 1995. The numbers living on less than a \$1000 a year increased
from 55% to 70% (Serioux, 1999). Data from the World Health Organization
shows that correspond­ ing to the massive increase in impoverish­ ment and
indebtedness under the global economic regime, parts of sub­Saharan
Africa now have adult mortality rates that are higher than 30 years ago.
In Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and Zimbabwe, for in­ stance, life
expectancy for men and women has reduced by 20 years. In Africa, 40 per­
cent of deaths occur within the age range of below five years. Of the 10
million children who die worldwide unnecessarily every year, half occur
in Africa. Of the 20 coun­ tries with the highest child mortality rates,
19 are in Africa. Of the16 countries with higher mortality rates than in
1990, 14 are in Africa. Of the 9 countries whose child mortality rate is
higher than those recorded over 20 years ago, 8 are in Africa. The vast
majority of these deaths were not only fore­ seeable; they were entirely
preventable, res­ ulting largely from malnutrition, diarrhoea, malaria
and infections of the lower respirat­ ory tract. Simple investments in
clean wa­ ter, improved sanitation and basic precau­ tionary health care
such as insecticide­ treated nets and more effective malarial drugs made
available to the population could easily prevent much of these deaths
(WHO, 2004). Now over 1 million children die annually ---3,000 every
day--- of mal­ aria, simply due to lack of access to appro­ priate
medication (WHO/UNICEF, 2003). [While these mortality rates have
steadily increased over decades, the global economic regime has
continued to conduct the same fundamental pattern of market­oriented
policies designed to cut spending on health care and sanitation
ultimately in the interest of transnational capital. But the example of
Africa is not isolated. On the contrary, it is representative of a
decades­long pattern of Southern death­by­deprivation generated
systematically by the global economic re­ gime (Nef, 1997).]{.underline}
Conclusions [Globalization as promoted by powerful bearers of capital,
including Western gov­ ernments, banks and transnational corpora­ tions,
is clearly of benefit to those who have already accumulated considerable
amounts of capital, or who otherwise retain profes­ sional skills that
can be sold or traded on the market. The poor, lacking both capital and
the necessary professional skills, are in­ creasingly marginalized,
disempowered and periphalized in both developed and less de­ veloped
countries, not only between the North and South, but even within both
Northern and Southern countries. The inter­]{.underline} national
economic order is thus systematic­ ally shifting resources and power in
favour of predominantly Northern transnational capital, at the expense
of the predominantly Southern multi­national poor. Given the consistency
with which these policies have produced the same pattern of mounting
death­by­deprivation, and given the extent to which this pattern has been
thoroughly publicly documented by numer­ ous official government and
inter­govern­ mental agencies (including the IMF and the World Bank
themselves), it is impossible to credibly claim that the key actors in
the global economic regime are not cognizant of the impact of their
policies (Kim, 2000; Chossudovsky, 2003). Even if it may be quite
unfounded, if not patently absurd, to assert that transnational
death­by­depriva­ tion constitutes the outcome of a conscious plan to
exterminate millions of people loc­ ated in African, Asian and other
Southern nations peripheral to the world capitalist economy, it is
similarly absurd to suggest that the principal agential entities --
North­ ern governments, institutions, and corpora­ tions [-- responsible
for erecting and pre­ serving the fundamental architecture of the global
economic regime, are completely ig­ norant of the structural violence
produced by globalization. As with the global process of environmental
degradation, intent with regards to the systematic rise of Southern
death­by­deprivation by now can be said to have formed, on the part of
these key Northern governmental, institutional and corporate actors.
Indeed, the vast bulk of the policies of the global economic regime are
under­ pinned by neo­Malthusian principles de­ rived from the logic of
neo­liberalism (Nair and Kirbat, 2004). Former editor of Popula­ tion and
Environment Virginia Abernethy (1991: 323, 326), for example, defends
the "legitimacy of unevenly distributed wealth," on the basis of
conserving scarce resources and protecting the "legitimacy of owner­
ship." Her emphasis on over­population as]{.underline} the most prominent
destructive force in LDCs is also representative of a general
ideological trend in much developmental discourse. Similarly, Nobel
Prize­winning economist Arthur Lewis argued that since the key to growth
is capital accumulation, [inequality was good for development and
growth, because the rich save more than the poor]{.underline}. Simon
Kuznets, another Nobel Prize winner, saw inequality as an inevitable
byproduct of the initial stages of develop­ ment, but believed that later
this trend would reverse (Kuznets cited in Stiglitz, 2002: 79). [These
highly influential perspect­ ives propose that the generation of inequal­
ity -- structural violence -- is an inevitable and legitimate dimension
of a desirable and successful market­oriented economic policy. Neo­liberal
ideology therefore sees violence and progress as two sides of the same
coin.]{.underline} As to the target groups of these destruct­ ive
economic policies, they clearly consist of a multiplicity of national
groups that are peripheral to the world economy, and as such are
functionally subordinate to the in­ terests of transnational capital.
[Con­ sequently, the well­being and even survival of these national groups
is considered ulti­ mately irrelevant to the protection and pro­ mulgation
of those interests.]{.underline} But more spe­ cifically, although these
national groups are generally targeted, the specific victims of global
structural violence are largely the most impoverished classes within
these na­ tional groups, classes that entirely lack the ability to access
or connect to the market. **[Thus, the intrinsic logic of market econom­
ics categorizes the class of multi­national poor -- largely members of
Southern nation­ al groups -- as irrelevant, indeed, as dispos­ able
relative to the more significant in­ terests of transnational capital, to
which the former are subordinated. Heggenhougen (1996) describes this as
"functional apartheid", a process of structur­ al "discrimination against
or the so­called 'setting apart' of 'disposable people.'" This sense of
'disposability' applies largely to the populations of LDCs, whose
primary func­ tion is to serve as "open economic territories and
'reserves' of cheap labour and natural resources" for the North, whose
role and po­ sition in the global economy is defined by its "unequal
structure of trade, production and credit"]{.underline}** (Chossudovsky,
1991: 2527). In­ deed, the term "unpeople" was originally coined by
historian and development spe­ cialist Mark Curtis (cited in Pilger,
1998: 55) to describe "**[those whose lives have been deemed expendable,
worthless, in the pursuit of foreign policy objectives", includ­ ing the
imperial imperatives underlying the market­orientated economic order. Un­
people are therefore "human beings who impede the pursuit of high policy
and whose rights, often lives, therefore become irrelev­ ant" (Curtis,
2004). The concept of "un­ people" is thus intrinsic to the logic of glob­
alization which concentrates capital in few­ er and fewer hands while
marginalizing in­ creasing numbers of people in LDCs, in the pursuit of
lofty market values (Opotow, 1995).]{.underline}** [This
is,]{.underline} moreover, an arguably [genocidal logic, rooted in an
ultimately genocidal in­ tent]{.underline}. The key actors in pivotal
positions of power within the global economic regime are cognizant of
the devastating impact of globalization on the world's multi­national
poor. Hence, they can no longer be absolved of responsibility by
reckless but intentional indifference toward this global structural vi­
olence that generates mass deaths­by­ deprivation of millions of people
across the globe. [Returning to the example of Africa, although millions
of African children die an­ nually due to a variety of preventable dis­
eases ---a fact that is well­documented and known to the key actors in
the global eco­ nomic regime--- rather than endorsing in­ creases in
public spending on urgent health and sanitation requirements, the global
eco­ nomic regime enforces the very opposite, thus deliberately depriving
these children of the facilities and medication necessary to prevent
and/or cure the savage conditions of life that lead to such swift and
high mor­ tality rates**. In doing so, the global economic regime is
obviously not only complicit in, but principally responsible for, these
deaths, by perpetuating -- indeed worsening -- the artificial structural
constraints that exacer­ bate the incidence of mass
deaths.**]{.underline} Moreover, such policies of the global eco­ nomic
regime are clearly targeted princip­ ally against multiple peripheral
national groups in the South, and specifically against the poorest
classes of those groups. The key agents of the global economic regime
are by now fully aware that an inevitable con­ sequence of their
market­oriented policies is the periphalization and eventual death of
such unpeople. Thus, these key actors in the global eco­ nomic regime
have demonstrated implicit intent to destroy in part multiple national
and lower class groups of the 'Third World' in the pursuit of capital
accumulation, by deliberately creating and perpetuating condi­ tions of
life that will bring about their partial physical destruction. [This is
therefore a form of global structural violence with distinctly genocidal
features, bearing strong parallels with previous cases of genocidal
structural violence such as colonization and collectiv­ ization. It
therefore seems justifiable to see the impact of the international
economic or­ der as not merely a case of structural viol­ ence, but more
specifically a form of struc­ tural genocide. At the very least, it must
be seen as possessing markedly genocidal or quasi­genocidal
characteristics.]{.underline}

### Hegemony Links

#### Hegemony is based on an ideological fantasy of US exceptionalism that necessitates [permanent war making]{.underline}---you should look at the benefits of hegemony from the outside-looking-in. Their theoretically scary impacts obscure the [real consequences]{.underline} of hegemony.

Richard **JACKSON**, Professor of International Politics at Aberystwyth

[The history of US foreign policy is a **violent and bloody one**,
although this is not]{.underline} necessarily [the dominant
perception]{.underline} of most Americans. [From]{.underline} the
[frontier wars of subjugation against Native Peoples to colonial wars
against Mexico, Spain and the Philippines, the Cold War interventions in
Korea, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Vietnam, Nicaragua, Grenada,
Lebanon, Panama, Libya]{.underline} and elsewhere, [the post-Cold War
interventions in Somalia, Iraq, Sudan, Afghanistan, and Kosovo, and the
post-9/11 interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen
and Libya today, the US has an **unrivaled record of war and foreign
military intervention**]{.underline}. There are in fact, few periods in
its history when the US has not been engaged in war or military attacks
on other countries. In addition, [the US is the world's largest
manufacturer and exporter of military weapons, and has a military budget
several times greater than all its nearest rivals combined. It
is]{.underline} in fact, [**the most warring nation in modern history**.
It is in this historical context that we have to try and understand its
current military involvement in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, the
Horn of Africa and Libya]{.underline}. [Although it is sometimes
argued]{.underline} by apologists that [these military actions
are]{.underline} always [defensive]{.underline} in nature rather than
proactive and expansionist, [and are the result of]{.underline} real and
[serious threats to US security or the wider international system, the
virtually impregnable security position of the US]{.underline},
notwithstanding the 9/11 attacks a decade ago, [makes this argument
unconvincing. The reality is]{.underline} that [the size of the US
landmass and population, the]{.underline} vast [oceans to
its]{.underline} eastern and western [borders and the friendly countries
to its north and south, and the extent of its economic and military
power, means]{.underline} that [there are no serious obstacles
to]{.underline} the adoption of [an isolationist foreign policy or
even]{.underline} the adoption of [a pacifist role in international
affairs]{.underline}. In other words, [there is **nothing inevitable or
predetermined about its long record of war and
intervention**]{.underline}. Explaining the historical record of US
foreign intervention requires a careful evaluation of both its strategic
interests and its ideological system, as it is the almost unique
combination of these factors and the way in which they underpin and
interact with each other which helps to explain why the US continues to
be the most violent state in the international system today.
Strategically, the US is today the world's dominant power. In order [to
maintain this hegemonic position]{.underline} in the international
system, [which is the primary]{.underline} and preeminent [goal
of]{.underline} all [US foreign policy]{.underline} (or at least, no
major foreign policy initiative can seriously contradict this first
principle goal), [necessitates a number of key measures]{.underline},
such as: [maintaining military advantage]{.underline} over rivals,
[which]{.underline} in turn [requires a permanent]{.underline} internal
[m]{.underline}ilitary-[i]{.underline}ndustrial [c]{.underline}omplex;
[a system of allies and a military presence in bases]{.underline}
stretched [around the globe]{.underline}, especially in strategic
regions like the Middle East and the Horn of Africa; [influence
over]{.underline} or control of strategic [resources such as oil;
domination]{.underline} or at least influence [over the global
economic]{.underline} and trading [system; significant influence in
international institutions; and preventing the rise of serious
challengers]{.underline} to its overall hegemony. At the same time, [the
US has evolved]{.underline} since the founding of the republic [a core
set of ideological beliefs which are]{.underline} now deeply
[embedded]{.underline} culturally and accepted [by]{.underline} both the
political elite and the wider [society. Some of these beliefs are
necessitated by]{.underline}, and functional to, [the military power of
the US: maintaining a]{.underline} costly and **[permanent
m]{.underline}**ilitary-**[i]{.underline}**ndustrial
**[c]{.underline}**omplex [capable of staying ahead]{.underline} of its
rivals, for example, [requires a supporting set of cultural values which
valorize military prowess]{.underline}, patriotism and sacrifice in war.
[These values]{.underline} are now part of the military-industrial-media
complex in which video games and movies, among others, [serve
as]{.underline} recruitment tools for the military, narrative [frames
for interpreting foreign threats and as propaganda for generating
support for]{.underline} foreign [military intervention]{.underline}.
Importantly, [this]{.underline} military-industrial-media [complex has
come to **generate its own material** and political interests, in part
because it **requires actual wars to reproduce and sustain
itself**]{.underline}. Other important ideological values include the
strongly-held belief that the US has been called by history (or God) to
protect the so-called free world from major threats. Thus, it is
believed that the US was first called to defeat the threat posed by the
Axis powers, then the communist threat, and today, the global threat of
terrorism. [This ideological belief rests on the notion]{.underline}
that [the US is uniquely placed -- by virtue of its military and
economic power, and its moral values -- to ensure the safety of the
civilized world; it is the 'exceptional nation' which must lead the
world]{.underline}. Related to this, [the US has come to
believe]{.underline} that [its core values of liberty and democracy are
actually universal values which is it bound to protect at home and
spread abroad]{.underline}. As with its military values, these
ideological beliefs are ubiquitous in popular and political culture. It
is the combination of [the US's strategic interests and its ideological
dispositions]{.underline} in the past two hundred years or more which
**[explains the frequency and geographical distribution of its military
interventions]{.underline}**. In some cases, interventions have been
launched primarily to protect perceived strategic interests, such as the
case of the first Gulf War in which Iraq took control of Kuwait oil
reserves and appeared to seriously threaten Saudi oil reserves. In other
cases, the US's strategic interests coincided with strong ideological
imperatives, such as the Libyan intervention today where the presence of
significant oil reserves and the desire to create a pro-US regime in a
strategic region has combined with the US ideological value of spreading
democracy and overthrowing a long-term dictator and US opponent. The key
point however, is that ideological values such as democracy promotion
only rarely generate sufficient will by themselves for military
intervention, although Somalia and Kosovo may be considered exceptions
(although there were strategic interests involved in both cases). In
many other cases, such as Rwanda in the 1990s and Syria today, such
ideological imperatives are insufficient on their own to generate US-led
military intervention. At the same time, no wars can be justified or
defended to the American public, except by claiming that they fit US
ideological values; US politicians cannot admit that they are ever at
war solely to secure strategic advantage. Of course,
[during]{.underline} some periods such as the cold war and to a lesser
degree [the war on terror, US strategic interests simply overrode
ideological commitments to human rights or democracy promotion, as it
supported a series of brutal dictatorships in]{.underline} places like
[Latin America, Asia and Africa]{.underline}. In some cases, [the US
even approved of mass murder, such as the Indonesian government's
suppression of Communists in 1965 which killed 500,000 people, its
support for the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia, and its support for Latin
American death squad activities in places like Chile and El Salvador.
In]{.underline} other special cases, such as [Israel and Saudi Arabia,
US strategic interests override ideological commitment entirely and
little real effort is made to promote values-based
policies]{.underline}. The war on terror, particularly the Iraq and
Afghanistan interventions, demonstrates the interplay of these two
factors, with both strategic interests -- dealing with the threat of
terrorism, the securing of Iraq's oil and Afghanistan's potential role
as an access-point to Central Asian oil reserves, fashioning pro-US
regimes, and the construction of military bases in strategic regions to
put pressure on countries like Iran -- and ideological imperatives --
bringing liberty and democracy to countries wracked by human rights
abuses -- driving the interventions. Paradoxically, of course, the war
on terror, like many previous US interventions, has resulted in massive
human rights abuses around the world and the denial of liberty to
millions, with torture, rendition, and the denial of civil rights
commonplace, among others. At the same time, it has also endangered US
strategic interests: the attack on Iraq strengthened and emboldened
Iran, destabilized Pakistan, and greatly damaged the reputation and
standing of the US in the Middle East and large parts of the Muslim
world. In the end, [the culturally and politically embedded ideology of
the US]{.underline} -- [its militarized patriotism]{.underline} --
[blinds its leaders and public to the interests and consequences of its
military interventions, and **sustains the likelihood of future
interventions**. Few Americans accept that its country's wars have
killed, injured and displaced literally millions of people in the last
few decades, most often for little or no positive result in either
strategic or ideological terms -- that in fact **the real-world
consequences** of its interventions are virtually always the **denial of
its own stated values** of liberty and democracy. Fewer]{.underline}
still [question why the US is **willing to sacrifice thousands or even
millions** of lives to secure its strategic interests, or why the US
population is so perennially vulnerable to ideological appeals by
leaders which mask the deeper strategic reasons for violent
intervention]{.underline}. While it is unlikely that its strategic
interests will change any time soon or that the military-industrial
complex can be significantly reduced in size, there is always the hope
that new leaders might arise and [**peace movements** might emerge which
are able to challenge, and]{.underline} perhaps even [change, the
militarized patriotism and deeply-embedded culture of violence which
makes the US the most violent state in the world]{.underline}.

### China Links

#### The representation of China as the source of existential threat and economic opportunity produces cycles of disillusion and conflict.

Chengxin **[PAN]{.underline}** Deakin University, Humanities and Social
Sciences Department **['12]{.underline}** *Knowledge, desire and power
in global politics western representations of China\'s rise* p.
[148-149]{.underline}

[[At the core of the Western]{.mark} self - [imagination is the]{.mark}
modern [knowing subject . Implying the existence of a]{.mark} certain,
objectively [knowable world ' out there ' , this]{.mark} self -
fashioning [affords the West]{.mark} both [the]{.mark} confidence and
**[duty to]{.mark} know and [lead that world]{.mark}** [. W hen]{.mark}
certain [knowledge about]{.mark} a particular 'object' , as in the case
of [China, is]{.mark} stubbornly [not forthcoming, the]{.mark} self -
professed knowing [subject]{.mark} then [resorts to certain]{.mark}
emotional substitutes such as fear and [fantasy]{.mark} to make up for
the absence of certainty . With [fear]{.mark} , one [may restore]{.mark}
a **sense of ([negative) certainty]{.mark}** [about]{.mark} an
**[existential threat]{.mark} ' out there** ' , a threat [which
seems]{.mark} readily accounted for by [the **timeless wisdom of
realism** (**and** ]{.mark}]{.underline}to some extent
[**[liberalism]{.mark}**) . Alternatively , with the subliminal aid of
fantasy , the West can envisage an immensely soothing scenario of
opportunity, engagement and convergence that carries with it a
teleological predictability about how History begins, evolves, and ends.
Thanks to those emotional substitutes, the initial 'inscrutability' of
China's Otherness gives way to more comprehensible imageries: it is now
either an affront to , or an opportunity for , the Western self and its
will to truth and power . Either way, [it]{.mark} becomes a reassuring
object of aversion and attraction that [allows]{.mark} for continued
[Western]{.mark} self - [posturing]{.mark} as the modern knowing subject
. Indeed, a s [evidenced in]{.mark} the [two]{.mark} dominant sets of
China [discourses]{.mark} , the Western self and its Chinese Other are
mutually constitutive .]{.underline} [More importantly, such mutual
constructions are from the out set linked to power and political
practice. At one level, they are complicit in the political economies of
fear and [fantasy]{.mark} ' at home ' . At another level, they are
constitutive of foreign policy which in turn [helps construct the
Other]{.mark} in reality . Consequently , the China discourses turn out
to be an integral and constitituive part of their ' object of study ' .
For example, a s illustrated in Chapters 4 - 5, America's '[China
threat' discourse]{.mark} both [contributes to]{.mark}, and is
reproduced by, the **US partisan [politics of fear]{.mark}** [and
**military Keynesianism**]{.mark}**.** At the same time, [this]{.mark}
threat imagery [helps sustain]{.mark} a [containment]{.mark} policy of
sorts. By [provoking similar responses from China]{.mark}, such a policy
**ends up [participating in the creation of the]{.mark} very
[threat]{.mark} it seeks to contain**. The '[China opportunity'
narrative]{.mark} , by contrast , tends to favour a policy of
**engagement** . **But** as examined in Chapter 6, this paradigm and its
associated engagement strategy are more often than not false promises .
They [are false in that their assumption of the West]{.mark}/ US [and
China in terms of]{.mark} a temporal [self/Other]{.mark} hierarchy
allows their advocates to ignore or at least downplay China 's inherent
subjectivities and agency in this intersubjective relationship . To the
extent that Sino - Western relations are intersubjective, socialisation
does occur, but it takes place on a mutual basis , rather than as a on
e - way traffic . In this context , the promises of the ' China
opportunity ' become less certain and more problematic. Yet often
**oblivious to its own false premises**, [the **paradigm**]{.mark}
instead [**blames China**]{.mark} (**and** to a lesser extent, **Western
engagers**) for its **increasingly apparent 'China fantasy** ' . What is
significant about this ' China opportunity' disillusionment is that it
converges with the ' China threat ' imagery and together justifies a
tougher approach to a country which now not only appears unreceptive to
our tutelage but also grows menacingly stronger by the day.
Consequently, for all their apparent differences , [the 'threat' and
'opportunity' paradigms]{.mark} are the two sides of the same coin of
Western knowledge, desire, and power in China watching . In essence,
both are specific manifestations of a modern quest for certainty in an
uncertain world . These seismic twin s are not only similar in terms of
their discursive functions of constructing self / Other, but they are
also joined together in practice . They [make up a powerful bifocal lens
for China watching]{.mark} , a lens which can largely account for the
emergence and popularity of the 'hedging' strategy towards
China]{.underline}

#### The "responsible stakeholder" narrative of China projects US neoliberal-constructivist desires -- it is the flip-side of China threat discourses.

A Responsible Stakeholder: The Opportunity for Global Integration In
addition to the wealth-democracy linkage, some observers believe that
those opportunities in turn set the stage for integrating China into the
international system. [As [China]{.mark} becomes more open economically
and politically, it [holds the promise of becoming a 'responsible
stakeholder']{.mark}, a term coined by Zoellick]{.underline}. In his
remarks to the National Committee on US-China Relations in September
2005, [Zoellick noted that as a responsible stakeholder, China would
share with the US a common interest in sustaining an open international
economic system that had proven crucial to the prosperity of both
countries and the world at large]{.underline}.99 While the Chinese
initially struggled to find a Chinese equivalent to the English word
'stakeholder', this 'responsible stakeholder' rendition of the China
opportunity instantly strikes a responsive chord in Western foreign
policy circles. [For many observers, a more responsible China bodes well
for the prospect of 'locking China into an American-dominated
international order']{.underline}.100 [Three interrelated factors seem
to underpin this optimistic assessment: China's deepening economic
interdependence, its transition to democracy, and its cognitive learning
of international norms and rules through a process of socialisation and
norm diffusion]{.underline}. First, China's [economic
development]{.underline}, as well as generating commercial
opportunities, [helps bolster its integration with the global economy,
thus providing a strong incentive for it to behave more responsibly on
the world stage.]{.underline} Drawing implicitly on nineteenth-century
liberals' faith in the peaceful effect of commerce, many pundits are
confident that Beijing's focus on economic development and trade signals
a convergence of Sino-American commercial and national interests. 101
For instance, as the Chinese become as dependent on the flow of Persian
Gulf oil as Americans and Europeans have, it is argued that a common
interest in open sea lanes may arise, thereby brightening the prospect
for cooperation.102 In this context, Susan Shirk, former Deputy
Assistant Secretary of State responsible for US relations with China,
predicts that Beijing cannot but behave 'like a cautious, responsible
power... intent on avoiding conflicts that would disrupt economic growth
and social stability'.103 In his characteristically playful style, New
York Times columnist Thomas Friedman calls this whole phenomenon the
'Dell theory of conflict prevention'. The gist of his theory is this:
the economic interdependence between China and its East Asian neighbours
through the global supply chain will help overcome the historical and
geopolitical rivalry between China and Taiwan as well as that between
China and Japan. As he approvingly quoted from a senior official at
Dell, contrary to some received wisdom, this supply chain makes the
amiable co-existence of a strong Japan and a strong China possible.104
Second, with Chinese democratisation, there appears to be a better
chance for China's emergence as a peaceful player in international
relations. In the words of Diamond, 'a China governed by the more
comprehensive architecture of democracy... would be a more responsible
regional neighbor and global actor'.105 For Gilley, a China pursuing a
'democratic foreign policy' would be 'a salutary new force for global
justice, peace, and development'.106 [Almost [claiming]{.mark} that [a
democratic China would offer a panacea]{.mark} for regional
stability]{.underline}, [[Gilley]{.mark} then [goes on to list a]{.mark}
whole [range of]{.mark} thorny international [problems]{.mark} which
would easily go away, [such as]{.mark} its testy [relations]{.mark} with
the US, the [Taiwan]{.mark} impasse, territorial claims in [the South
China Sea]{.mark}, border [disputes with India and Russia, and the
ethnic tensions]{.mark} in Tibet and Xinjiang.]{.underline} Meanwhile,
[according to a particular **cottage industry** in the field of Chinese
foreign policy, the country's **socialisation into multilateral
international institutions**, norms, and regimes further enhances its
'**global commitments and responsibility'**]{.underline}. 107 In a
popular attempt to gauge the level of Beijing's 'acceptance of the
legitimacy of the current international economic and political
system',108 [scholars have surveyed almost every aspect of China's
engagement with international institutions]{.underline}, ranging from
its relations with the United Nations to its participation in the
regimes of international trade and investment, security and arms
control, environmental protection, energy, telecommunications, as well
as human rights.109 And typically most of their findings are
encouraging. For example, Economy and Oksenberg maintain that overall
'China has become less distinctive. Its foreign policy calculus
increasingly resembles that of other major powers'. Hence their verdict
that it 'has rejoined the world'.110 As China emerges as a responsible
stakeholder on the world stage, it is believed that it will provide
further economic and political opportunities. [[For example,
Beijing's]{.mark} legal and commercial [reforms in]{.mark} accordance
with]{.underline} World Trade Organization [([WTO]{.mark}) requirements
[would make China an ideal place for America]{.mark}ns to 'contemplate
doing business or expand existing business']{.underline}, [once
claimed]{.underline} Robert A. [Kapp]{.underline}, who served as
president of the US-China Business Council during the period of China's
entry into the WTO.111 A number of US officials echoed Kapp's optimism.
Arguing for the case of granting China's accession to this global
multilateral trade regime, then Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
insisted that China's WTO membership 'would give the United States more
access to China's market, boost our exports, reduce our trade deficit,
and create new, well-paying jobs'.112 Similarly, Clinton's national
security adviser Samuel Berger saw a positive feedback loop between
China's global integration and domestic political change. As he put it,
'Just as NAFTA \[the North American Free Trade Agreement\] membership
eroded the economic base of one-party rule in Mexico, WTO membership...
can help do the same in China'.113 [[This]{.mark} confidence in China's
transformation into a responsible stakeholder [has been supported
by]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}two influential perspectives[:
[neoliberal institutionalism and constructivism]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Both approaches assume that growing interdependence and integration
enables states to learn international norms and redefine their national
interests and identities. For many, China represents an exemplar case of
such cognitive learning. For example, by looking at its institutional
integration process, Thomas Robinson provides an interesting analysis of
the evolution of Chinese attitudes towards the notion of
interdependence. He notes that throughout much of the 1990s, Chinese
statements became increasingly favourable to this notion, thereby
raising hope that, given time, China could be eventually converted to
'full interdependence' and 'end up with the same domestic structure
(market economy) and foreign policy (peace and internationalism) as
other developed nations'.114 In the security realm, a systematic study
of China's socialisation by Alastair Iain Johnston notes a similar
trend. Between 1980 and 2000, 'Chinese leaders adopted more cooperative
and potentially self-constraining commitments to security institutions'.
This development, according to Johnston, testifies to both the
constitutive influence of international institutions and the cognitive
learning capacity of China's foreign policy makers.115 Coupled with his
study on the attitudes of a liberalising Chinese middle class towards
world affairs, Johnston has provided a largely optimistic assessment on
the prospect of China becoming a responsible stakeholder.116 WE ARE ALL
PANDA HEDGERS': THE AMBIVALENCE OF THE BIFOCAL LENS This chapter has
briefly surveyed the main arguments and theoretical underpinnings of the
'China threat' and 'China opportunity' paradigms. By way of conclusion,
I should stress three points. First, to reiterate the obvious, this is
not a comprehensive survey of China studies in the West. At most, it is
only a snapshot of some recent Western writings on China's rise in the
field of international relations. To equate the latter with Western
understanding of China as a whole would be misleading, and certainly
that is not this author's intention. Second, by singling out these two
paradigms, I do not seek to pigeonhole China observers into two
pre-existing ideological or scholarly camps. Some analysts, motivated by
the belief in either moral clarity or the supposedly timeless wisdom of
power politics, do subscribe to some sharp images of the China threat.
Likewise, some starry-eyed business leaders may often see China as
little more than an economic opportunity. But overall these paradigms do
not correspond neatly with two clearly-defined, discrete groups of
observers or two homogeneous bodies of quintessential literature. The
'[[China threat' discourse]{.mark} often transcends the political
divides between the conservative right and progressive left,
[and]{.mark} resonates with defence industrialists and human rights
activists alike]{.underline}. Similarly, [[the 'China opportunity'
paradigm]{.mark} is not held exclusively by any particular
category]{.underline} of people, but is shared by a diverse group of
observers of various political persuasions. Third, to the extent that
these fundamental images represent two different cognitive frameworks
within which to understand China's rise, [they may be treated as rival
paradigms]{.underline}, which 'see different things when they look from
the same point in the same direction'.117 [But]{.underline} even so,
[they [are not mutually exclusive]{.mark}]{.underline}, incompatible, or
incommensurable. As Richard J. Bernstein argues, 'There is always some
overlap between rival paradigms---overlap of observations, concepts,
standards, and problems. If there were no such overlap, rational debate
and argumentation between proponents of rival paradigms would not be
possible'.118 In fact, [[a bifocal lens that encompasses both paradigms
has been characteristic of]{.mark} mainstream [Western
literature]{.mark} on China's rise]{.underline}. Often [dreading and
marvelling at China's economic rise at the same time,]{.underline} the
business world is clearly prone to this bifocal framework, as [trade
magazines and newsletters are saturated with endless analyses of the
China 'threat' and 'opportunity']{.underline}. William Callahan has
documented how [[the bifocal lens is deployed by]{.mark} business
analysts and [security experts to understand the]{.mark} phenomenon of
'Greater [China' as]{.mark} both a [danger]{.mark} of China's imperial
expansion [and]{.mark} an [opportunity of]{.mark} the newest version of
[capitalist utopia]{.mark}]{.underline}. 119 Sometimes even the same
observer subscribes to both imageries. The CNN commentator and anchor
Lou Dobbs is a case in point. A staunch defender of American jobs and
author of bestseller Exporting America, Dobbs lashed out at those US
companies who moved their production to China, a country which, in his
view, was a source of threat to the American economy and job security.
But on the other hand, as an investment adviser, Dobbs had no qualms
about recommending his clients to buy shares of the very companies that
have established a presence in China (and India). Consequently, Dobbs's
China was both an economic threat and opportunity.120 In the scholarly
community, the bifocal lens is equally palpable. As mentioned above, on
the one hand, Johnston perceives a China threat through an analysis of
Chinese strategic culture, but on the other hand, he seems to believe in
the malleability of Chinese interests and identity through
socialisation. Drawing on a constructivist approach, he in fact sees no
contradiction between these two arguments. Nor do William Kristol and
Robert Kagan find it incompatible to believe at once in the China threat
and in its opportunity for regime change. In a way, just as the
missionaries' enthusiasm for the salvation of the Chinese heathens was
often prompted by he very belief in the Chinese as great sinners,
Kristol and Kagan's hope for China's political transformation is made
more imper ative not despite, but precisely because of their fear of
China as a political and mil i tary threat. 121 Indeed, it is now
difficult to find a work which does not treat China as both a cha l
lenge and an opportunity, even though most would lean towards one or th
e other end of the spectrum . 122 E ven policy - makers who normally
favour clear - cut, unambiguous i m ages seem to have largely avoid ed
an either/or assessment . For instance, distancing himself from the
'strategic competitor' rhetoric of his early days in office, George W.
Bush later called relations with China 'complex', in the sense that
China was not just a potential threat, but also presented opportunities
for cooperation, such as in the 'War on Terror'. Zoellick, best known
for his preference for engaging Chin a, was similarly ambivalent, as his
'responsible stak e holder' speech can attest . Even as analysts and
policy - makers continue to effor t lessly invoke such seemingly
dichotomous terms as 'engagement' and 'containment' or binary questions
of whether China will emerge as a partner or strategic rival, their
concl u sion s are rarely one way or the other . 123 In this sense , the
China - watching community seems to have come a long way since Harry Har
d ing lamented more than two decades ago that 'We appear unable to see
Chin a as a complex society, in which some features are worthy of
approval and others demand criticism '. 124 Such apparent sophisticat
ion in C hina watching may prompt one to wonder whether it is still
plausible to speak of the two China paradigms in the first pla ce .
Could they just be this author's analytical straw men? They are not. T
he various combinations of threat and opportunity in Western imaginings
of China's rise testify to the very power of these two par a digms as
the outer limits of China representation . As just noted, together they
form a bifocal lens and provide an enduring ambivalen t framework for
China literacy . In a classic study of American attitudes towards China
first published in 1958 , Harold Isaacs noted the simultaneous presence
of two powerful scratches on Americans' minds: a despicable China and an
admirable China. As he put it astutely, 'In the long history of our
associ a tions with China, these two sets of images rise and fall, move
in and out of the center of people's minds over time, never w holly
displacing each other, always coexis t ing\... '. 125 Today , one could
easily substitute these scratches with the two China paradigms , and
understand how, now as then, China is viewed with profound ambivalence .
Speaking of this contemporary China ambivalence, what Ian Bremmer calls
the 'panda hed g ers' comes to mind . 126 'Panda huggers' and 'dragon
slayers' continue to exist, of course. But more often than not, these
two groups are not as mutually exclusive as their stark appellations
seem to suggest. In any case, both paradigms have been integral to
contemporary Western unde r standing of China's rise . At a given time
or in Threat and opportunity 41 a single piece of writing on China, a
particular imagery may be more pronounced. But a s a whole, Western
representation s of China's rise ha ve be en characterised by this
enduring ambiv a lence , a topic to which the next chapter will turn.

### Terrorism Links

#### Apocalyptic terrorism scenarios are grounded in vested political interests and violent modes of national-identity formation in which political reforms like the plan are used to carve the world into liberal and illiberal spheres---the impact is a racist extermination of alterity and expansive structural violence

New Terrorism vs. Old Terrorism The opening sentence of a textbook on
terrorism states, "[Terrorism has been a]{.underline} dark [feature of
human behavior since the dawn of]{.underline} recorded
[history]{.underline}" (Martin, 2010, 3). If this is the case, [what
makes]{.underline} the ['new terrorism' different]{.underline} from the
old? [According to]{.underline} the mainstream [orthodoxy]{.underline}
on terrorism, [the old terrorism was]{.underline} generally
[characterized by]{.underline}: left wing ideology; the use of [small
scale, conventional weapons; clearly identifiable
organizations]{.underline} or movements [with equally clear
political]{.underline} and social [messages]{.underline}; specific
selection of targets and "explicit grievances championing specific
classes or ethnonational groups" (Martin, 2010, 28). Also according to
the orthodoxy, [the shift to the new terrorism]{.underline}, on the
other hand, [is thought to have emerged in the early 1990s]{.underline}
(Jackson, 2011) [and took root in mass consciousness with]{.underline}
the [September 11]{.underline}, 2001 terrorist attacks on the U.S.
(Martin, 2010, 3). [The new terrorism is characterized by: "loose,
cell-based networks with minimal lines of command and control," "desired
acquisition of]{.underline} high-intensity weapons and
[w]{.underline}eapons of [m]{.underline}ass [d]{.underline}estruction"
(Martin, 2010, 27), "[motivated by religious fanaticism]{.underline}
rather than political ideology [and]{.underline} it [is aimed at causing
mass causality]{.underline} and maximum destruction" (Jackson, 2007,
179-180). However, [these dichotomous definitions]{.underline} of the
old and new types of terrorism [are not without problems]{.underline}.
The first major problem is that [terrorism has been characterized by the
same fundamental qualities throughout history]{.underline}. Some of the
superficial characteristics, the means of implementation (e.g. the
invention of the Internet or dynamite) or the discourse (communism vs.
Islam) may have evolved, but the central components remain the same. The
second major problem is that [the characterization of new terrorism
is]{.underline}, at best, [rooted in a particular political ideology,
biased and inaccurate. At worst, it is **racist, promotes war
mongering** and has **contributed to millions of deaths**]{.underline}.
As David Rapoport states: Many contemporary studies begin ... by stating
that although terrorism has always been a feature of social existence,
it became 'significant' ... when it 'increased in frequency' and took on
'novel dimensions' as an international or transnational activity,
creating in the process a new 'mode of conflict' (1984, 658). Isabelle
Duyvesteyn points out that this would indicate evidence for the
emergence of a new type of terrorism, if it were not for the fact that
the article was written in 1984 and described a situation from the 1960s
(Duyvesteyn, 2004, 439). It seems that there have been many new phases
of terrorism over the years. So many so that the definition of 'new' has
been stretched significantly and applied relatively across decades.
Nevertheless, the idea that this terrorism, that which the War on Terror
(WoT) is directed against, is the most significant and unique form of
terrorism that has taken hold in the popular and political discourse.
Therefore, it is useful to address each of the so-called new
characteristics in turn. The first characteristic is the idea that new
terrorism is based on loosely organized cell-based networks as opposed
to the traditional terrorist groups, which were highly localized and
hierarchical in nature. An oft-cited example of a traditional terrorist
group is the Irish Republican Army (IRA), who operated under a military
structure and in a relatively (in contrast to the perceived
transnational operations of al-Qaeda) localized capacity. However, some
of the first modern terrorists were not highly organized groups but
small fragmented groups of anarchists. These groups were heeding the
call of revolutionary anarchist Mikhail Bakunin and other contemporary
anarchists to achieve anarchism, collectivism and atheism via violent
means (Morgan, 2001, 33). Despite the initial, self-described
"amorphous" nature of these groups, they were a key force in the Russian
Revolution (Maximoff, G.). Furthermore, leading anarchist philosophers
of the Russian Revolution argued that terrorists "should organize
themselves into small groups, or cells" (Martin, 2010, 217). These small
groups cropped up all around Russia and Europe in subsequent years and
formed an early form of a "loosely organized cell-based network" not
unlike modern day al Qaeda. Duyvesteyn further notes that both the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which was founded in 1964, and
Hezbollah, founded 1982, operate on a network structure with very little
central control over groups (2004, 444). The second problematic idea of
new terrorism is [that contemporary terrorist groups aim to acquire and
use]{.underline} weapons of mass destruction ([WMDs]{.underline}). This
belief [is simply **not supported by empirical evidence**]{.underline}.
One of the key problems with this theory is that [WMDs are significantly
more difficult to obtain and utilize than most people understand. Even
if a terrorist group were to obtain a biological WMD]{.underline},
"Biologist Matthew [Meselson calculates]{.underline} that [it would take
a ton of nerve gas or five tons of mustard gas to produce heavy
causalities among unprotected people in an open area of one square
kilometer]{.underline}" (Mueller, 2005, 488). And that's only an example
of the problem with the implementation of WMDs, [assuming they are
acquired, transported and desirable by a terrorist group in the first
place. Additional problems, such as the fact that WMDs "are extremely
difficult to deploy and control"]{.underline} (Mueller, 2005, 488) [and
that making a bomb "is an extraordinarily difficult task"]{.underline}
(Mueller, 2005, 489), [further **diminish the risk**]{.underline}. It is
interesting to note that, [while the potential dangers of WMDs are much
lauded, the attacks of September 11th were low tech and had been
technologically possible for more than 100 years]{.underline}. Mueller
also states, "[although nuclear weapons have been around for well over
half a century, no state has ever given another state (much less a
terrorist group) a nuclear weapon that the recipient could use
independently]{.underline}" (2005, 490). All of this talk about the
difficultly of acquiring and deploying WMDs (by non-state agents), is
not to diminish the question of what terrorists have to gain by
utilizing these weapons. [It is important to question whether it would
even further the aims of terrorists to use WMDs. The evidence suggests
otherwise]{.underline}. In the "Politics of Fear" Jackson states,
"**[Mass casualties are most often counterproductive to terrorist
aims]{.underline}** -- [they alienate their supporters and can provoke
harsh reprisals from the authorities]{.underline} \[...\]" [in
addition]{.underline}, "\[...\] [they]{.underline} would [undermine
community support, distort the terrorist's]{.underline} political
[message, and invite over-whelming retaliation]{.underline}" (2007,
196-197). Despite popular rhetoric to the contrary, **[terrorists are
"rational political actors and are acutely aware of these
dangers"]{.underline}** (Jackson, 2007, 197). Government appointed
[studies on this issue have supported these views]{.underline}. This
leads us to the third problem with new terrorism, which is [the
idea]{.underline} that [we are facing a new era of terrorism motivated
by religious fanaticism rather than political ideology]{.underline}. As
stated previously, earlier, so-called traditional forms of terrorism are
associated with left wing, political ideology, whereas contemporary
terrorists are described as having "anti-modern goals of returning
society to an idealized version of the past and are therefore
necessarily anti-democratic, anti-progressive and, by implication,
irrational" (Gunning and Jackson, 3). Rapoport argues the idea that
religious terrorists are irrational, saying, "what seems to be
distinctive about modern \[religious\] terrorists, their belief that
terror can be organized rationally, [represents or distorts a major
theme peculiar to our own culture]{.underline} \[...\]" (1984, 660).
Conveniently for the interests of the political elites, as we shall see
later, [the idea of irrational fanaticism makes the notion of
negotiation and listening to the demands of the other
impossible]{.underline}. In light of this, it is interesting to note
that the U.S. has, for decades, given billions of dollars in aid to the
State of Israel, which could be argued to be a fundamentalist, religious
organization that engages in the terrorization of a group of people.
Further, it is difficult to speak of The Troubles in Northern Ireland
without speaking of the religious conflict, yet it was never assumed
that the IRA was "absolutist, inflexible, unrealistic, lacking in
political pragmatism, and not amenable to negotiation" (Gunning and
Jackson, 4). Rapaport further reinforces the idea that religious
terrorism goes back centuries by saying, "Before the nineteenth century,
religion provided the only acceptable justifications for terror..."
(1984, 659). As we have seen here, problems with the discourse of new
terrorism include the fact that these [elements of terrorism are neither
new nor are the popular beliefs of the discourse supported by empirical
evidence]{.underline}. The question remains, then, why is the idea of
new terrorism so popular? This question will be addressed next.
Political Investment in New Terrorism There are [two]{.underline} main
[categories]{.underline} that [explain the popularity of new
terrorism]{.underline}. The first category is [government and political
investment in the propagation of the idea that a distinct, historically
unknown type of terrorism exists. The mainstream discourse]{.underline}
\[1\] [reinforces]{.underline}, through statements by political elites,
media, entertainment and every other way imaginable, **[the culture of
violence, militarism and feelings of fear]{.underline}**. [Through mass
media, cultural norms and the integration of neoliberal ideology into
society, people are becoming increasingly desensitized to human
rights]{.underline} issues, [war, social justice and social
welfare]{.underline}, not to mention apathetic to the political process
in general. [The discourse of the WoT is merely the **contemporary
incarnation of this culture of fear and violence**. In the past, various
threats have included American Indians, women, African Americans,
communists, HIV/AIDS and drugs]{.underline}, to name but a few
(Campbell, 1992). It can be argued that [there are four main political
functions of terrorism discourse. The first is as a **distraction**
from]{.underline} other, more [immediate]{.underline} and [domestic
social problems such as poverty, employment, racial inequality, health
and the environment. The second]{.underline}, more sinister function [is
to control dissent]{.underline}. In looking at both of these issues
Jackson states: [There are]{.underline} a number of [clear political
advantages]{.underline} to be gained [from the creation of social
anxiety]{.underline} and moral panics. In the first place, [fear is a
disciplining agent and can be]{.underline} effectively [deployed to
de-legitimise dissent]{.underline}, mute criticism, and constrain
internal opponents. \[...\] Either way, [its primary function is to ease
the pressures of accountability for political elites]{.underline}. As
instrument of elite rule, **[political fear is]{.underline}** in effect
[**a political project** aimed at reifying existing structures of
power]{.underline}. (Politics of Fear, 2007, 185). Giroux further
reinforces the idea that a culture of fear creates conformity and
deflects attention from government accountability by saying, "the
ongoing appeal to jingoistic forms of patriotism divert the public from
addressing a number of pressing domestic and foreign issues; it also
contributes to the increasing suppression of dissent" (2003, 5). [Having
a problem that is "ubiquitous, catastrophic, and fairly
opaque"]{.underline} (Jackson, Politics of Fear, 2007, 185) [is
useful]{.underline} to political elites, [because it is nearly
impossible to address the efficacy of combating the
problem]{.underline}. At least, empirical evaluation can be, and is,
easily discouraged in academic circles through research funding
directives. Domestic problems such as the unemployment rate or health
care reform, on the other hand, are directly measurable and heavily
monitored by domestic sources. It is possible to account for the success
or failure of policies designed to address these types of problems and
the (re)election of politicians often depends heavily on success in
these areas. However, the public is neither involved on a participative
level nor, often, socially aware of what is happening in murkier and
unreachable areas like foreign policy. The third political investment in
maintaining the terrorism discourse has to do with economics. "At a
material level, [there are]{.underline} a great many [vested interests
in maintaining the widespread condition of fear, not least for the
military-industrial complex which benefits directly from increased
spending on national security]{.underline}" (Jackson, Politics of Fear,
2007, 186). [This is true with all]{.underline} forms of crime and
[insecurity as all]{.underline} of them [factor into the greater
security-industrial complex]{.underline}. Not only do these industries
employ millions of people and support their families, they boost the
economy. Barry Buzan talks of these the importance of these issues to
both the government and the public in terms of a 'threat-deficit' --
meaning that [U.S. policy and society is **dependent on having an
external threat**]{.underline} (Buzan, 2007, 1101). The fourth key
political interest in [terrorism discourse]{.underline} is
[construct]{.underline}ing [a national identity]{.underline}. This will
be discussed more thoroughly in the following section, however, it is
important to acknowledge the role the WoT (and previous threats) has had
on constructing and reinforcing a collective identity. [Examples of this
can be seen in the]{.underline} discourse and the subsequent [reaction
to anyone daring to step outside the parameters of the Bush]{.underline}
Administration-established [narrative]{.underline} in the days
immediately following the September 11th attacks. [A number of
journalists, teachers and university professors lost their jobs for
daring to speak out in criticism of U.S. policy]{.underline} and actions
following the attacks. In 2001, Lynne Cheney attacked the then deputy
chancellor of the New York City Schools, Judith Rizzo, for saying
"terrorist attacks demonstrated the importance of teaching about Muslim
cultures" (Giroux, 2003, 22). [According to Giroux, this form of
jingoistic patriotism "becomes a euphemism for shutting down dissent,
eliminating critical dialogue, and condemning critical citizenship in
the interest of conformity]{.underline} and a dangerous departure from
what it means to uphold a viable democracy" (2003, 24). The message is,
we are not the other (Muslims), patriotism equals agreement and
compliance and our identity is based on the shared values of liberty and
justice. According to Carol Winkler, "[Negative ideographs contribute to
our collective identity by branding behavior that is
unacceptable]{.underline} ... [American society defines itself as much
by its opposition to tyranny and slavery as it does by a commitment to
liberty]{.underline}" (Winkler, 2006, 12). [Terrorism]{.underline}, and
by association in this case, Islam, [functions as a negative ideograph
of American values. It thereby tells us what our values and our identity
are by telling us who the enemy is and who we are not]{.underline}.
According to Jackson, "\[...\] some have argued that Western identity is
dependent on the appropriation of a backward, illiberal, violent Islamic
'other' against which the West can organize a collective liberal,
civilized 'self' and consolidate its cultural and political norms"
(Jackson, Constructing Enemies, 2007, 420). Through this analysis we can
see there are four key ways in which the hegemonic system is invested in
propagating a culture of fear and violence and terrorism discourse. [Not
only is it key for political elites to support this system, it is also
crucial that there be an ever renewing threat that is uniquely different
from past threats. These new threats allow for the investment of
significantly more resources, the continuation of the economy, the
renewal of a strong sense of cultural identity and the indoctrination
and obedience of new generations of society]{.underline}. This essay
will now look at how individual and collective psychology supports the
popularity of the new terrorism discourse.

## Impact

### Securitization Impact

#### Militarism is an unsustainable system which creates the conditions of its own destruction. The results are global war, terror, ecological destruction, and nuclear use. Only a fundamental rethinking of the way we related to systems of violence can solve

Machine," http://joelkovel.com/the-united-states-military-machine/\]

I want to talk to you this evening about war -- not the immediate threat
of us [war against Iraq]{.underline}, but about how this conflict [is an
instance of a larger tendency toward war-making **endemic to our
society**]{.underline}. In other words, the phrase from the folksong, "I
ain't gonna study war no more," should be rethought. I think [we do have
to study war. Not to make war but to understand]{.underline} more deeply
[how it is put together and about the awful choices]{.underline} that
are now [being thrust upon us]{.underline}. These remarks have been
stimulated by [recent events]{.underline}, which [have ancient roots,
but have taken on a new shape]{.underline} since the collapse of the
Soviet Union, the rise of the second Bush administration, and the
inception of the so-called "War on Terror." [The shape is that of
**permanent warfare**- war-making that has no particular strategic goal
except total]{.underline} us [dominance over global
society]{.underline}. Hence, [a war without end and whose internal logic
is to perpetuate itself. We are]{.underline}, in other words, [well into
World War III, which will go on whether or not]{.underline} any other
state such as [Iraq is involved]{.underline}. It is quite probable that
this administration will go to war in Iraq, inasmuch as certain very
powerful people crave it. But it is not necessarily the case, given the
fact that the war against Iraq is such a lunatic proposal that many
other people in high places are against it and too many people are
marching against it. And [while war against Iraq is a very serious
matter that needs to be checked by massive popular resistance, equally
serious are the **structures now in place** in the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [dictating that whether or not the war]{.underline}
in Iraq [takes place, there will be another war to replace it, and
others after that, unless some very basic changes take
place]{.underline}. America Has Become a War-Making Machine [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has always been a bellicose
and expansive country, built on violent conquest]{.underline} and
expropriation [of native peoples]{.underline}. Since the forming of the
American republic, [military interventions have occurred at the rate of
about once a year]{.underline}. Consider the case of Nicaragua, a
country utterly incapable of being any kind of a threat to its giant
northern neighbor. Yet prior to the Sandinista revolution in 1979 (which
was eventually crushed by us proxy forces a decade later), our country
had invaded Nicaragua no fewer than 14 times in the pursuit of its
imperial interests. A considerable number of contemporary states, such
as Britain, South Africa, Russia, and Israel, have been formed in just
such a way. But one of the special conditions of the formation of
America, despite its aggressivity, was an inhibition against a military
machine as such. If you remember, no less a figure than George
Washington warned us against having a standing army, and indeed the
great bulk of us interventions prior to World War II were done without
very much in the way of fixed military institutions. However, after WWII
a basic change set in. War-weary America longed for demobilization, yet
after a brief beginning in this direction, the process was halted and
the permanent warfare state started to take shape. In part, this was
because [policy planners knew]{.underline} quite well that massive
[wartime mobilization had been the one measure that finally lifted
America out of the Great Depression]{.underline} of the 1930s. One of
the lessons of that time was that propounded by the British economist
John Maynard Keynes, to the effect that capitalist societies could
ameliorate chronic \[economic\] crises by infusions of government
spending. [The Great War had certified]{.underline} this wisdom, and
[permanent military expenditure readily became the received wisdom. This
was]{.underline} greatly [reinforced by the drastic realignment of
capitalist power as a result of the war. America was essentially the
only capitalist power in 1945 that did not lay in ruins and/or have its
empire shattered. The world had been realigned and the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [had assumed a global imperial
role]{.underline}. Policy planners like George Kennan lucidly realized
that [this meant **safeguarding extreme inequalities in wealth**, which
implied a permanent garrison to preserve the order of
things]{.underline}. The notion was especially compelling given that one
other state, the Soviet Union, had emerged a great power from the war
and was the bellwether of those forces that sought to break down the
prevailing distribution of wealth. The final foundation stone for the
new military order was the emergence of frightful weapons of mass
destruction, dominance over which became an essential element for world
hegemony. The Iron Triangle [These factors **crystallized** into the
Cold War, the nuclear arms race, and, domestically, into those
**structures that gave institutional stability and permanence** to the
system: the military-industrial complex]{.underline}
([mic]{.underline}). Previously the us had used militarism to secure
economic advantage. Now, two developments greatly transformed our
militarism: the exigencies of global hegemony and the fact that
militarism became a direct source of economic advantage, through the
triangular relations of the mic with the great armament industries
comprising one leg, the military establishment another, and the state
apparatus the third, profits, power, and personnel could flow through
the system and from the system. Clearly, this arrangement had the
potential to greatly undermine American democracy. [It was a "national
security state" within the state but also extended beyond it into the
economy and society at large, virtually insulated from popular input,
and had the power to direct events and generate threats]{.underline}.
Another conservative war hero-become-president, Dwight [Eisenhower,
warned the nation]{.underline} in a speech in 1961 [against the emerging
permanent war machine]{.underline}, but this time, the admonitions were
not heeded.\* [The machine made]{.underline} a kind of [war against the
Soviet system for 35 years]{.underline}. Although actual guns were not
fired between the two adversaries, as many as [10 million people died in
its]{.underline} varied [peripheral conflicts, from Korea to Vietnam,
Angola, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala. The Cold War divided the
world into bipolar imperial camps, directed by gigantic superpowers that
lived off]{.underline} each otherís [hostility]{.underline}. It was a
terrible war whose [immense suffering took place]{.underline} largely
[outside the view of the American people]{.underline}, but it also
brought about an uneasy kind of stability in the world order, in part
through the standoff in nuclear weapons. During the Ford and Carter
administrations, another great crisis seized the world capitalist
economy. Having matured past the rebuilding that followed the world war,
a period of stagnation set in, which still has the global economy in its
grip despite episodic flashes of vigor. Predictably, a spate of
militarism was central to the response. A "Second Cold War" took place
under Reagan, featuring an accelerated nuclear arms race, which was
deliberately waged so as to encourage Soviet countermeasures in the hope
that this would cause breakdown in the much weaker, bloated, and corrupt
Russian system. The plan worked splendidly: by 1989-91, the mighty
Soviet empire collapsed, and the bipolar world order became unipolar,
setting a stage for the current phase. The fall of the Soviet Union was
widely expected to bring a ìpeace dividend.î This would have been the
case according to the official us line, parroted throughout the media
and academe, that our military apparatus was purely defensive (after
all, we have no Department of War, only one of "Defense") and reactive
to Soviet expansionism and military/nuclear threat. As this was no
longer a factor, so the reasoning wentóindeed, as the us now stood
bestride the world militarily as had no power since the Roman
Empireóconventional logic predicted a general diminution in American
militarism after 1991, with corresponding benefits to society. The last
decade has at least settled this question, for the effect on us
aggression, interventionism, and the militarization of society has been
precisely the opposite. In other words, instead of braking, the machine
accelerated. Removal of Soviet power did not diminish Americaís imperial
appetite: it removed inhibitions on its internally driven expansiveness.
As a result, enhanced war-making has replaced the peace dividend. The
object of this machine has passed from dealing with Soviet Communism to
a more complex and dispersed set of oil wars (Iraq I and now II), police
actions against international miscreants (Kosovo), and now the
ubiquitous War Against Terror, aimed variously at Islamic
fundamentalists, Islam as a whole, or anybody irritated enough with the
ruling order to take up some kind of arms against it. The comparison
with the Roman Empire is here very exact. As the eminent economist and
sociologist Joseph Schumpeter described Rome in 1919: "There was no
corner of the known world where some interest was not alleged to be in
danger or under actual attack. If the interests were not Roman, they
were those of Rome's allies. And if Rome had no allies existed, the
allies would be invented. [The fight was always invested with the order
of legality]{.underline}. Rome was always being attacked by evil-minded
neighbors." [**The logic of constant threat meshes with that of ruthless
expansion**, which we see everywhere in this epoch of unipolar world
dominion]{.underline}. Currently, [the military budget]{.underline} of
the us [is 334 billion dollars]{.underline}. The budget for the next
fiscal year is 379 billion dollars- an increase of more than 10 percent.
By 2007, [the projected military budget]{.underline} of the us
[is]{.underline} to be an astounding 451 billion dollars: [almost half a
trillion dollars]{.underline}, without the presence of anything
resembling a conventional war. The present military budget is greater
than the sum of all other military budgets. In fact, it is greater than
the entire federal budget of Russia, once America's immortal adversary,
and comprises more than half -- 52 percent of all discretionary spending
by the us government. (By comparison, education accounts for 8 percent
of the federal budget.) A considerable portion of this is given over to
"military Keynesianism," according to the well-established paths of the
mic. Thus, although in the first years after the fall of the ussr
certain firms like General Dynamics, which had played a large role in
the nuclear arms race, suffered setbacks, that problem has been largely
reversed for the entire class of firms fattening at the trough of
militarism. It is fair to say, though, that the largesse is distributed
over a wider scale, in accordance with the changing pattern of
armaments. US Armies Taking Root Everywhere From having scarcely any
standing army in 1940, [American armies now stand everywhere. One
feature of us military policy since WWII is to make war and then stay
where war was made, rooting itself in foreign territory]{.underline}.
Currently, [the us has]{.underline} military [bases in 113
countries]{.underline}, with 11 new ones formed since the beginning of
the War Against Terror. [The us now has bases in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan,
and Kurdistan, encircling China and creating new sources of military
tension]{.underline}. On these bases, the us military has erected some
800,000 buildings. Imagine that: 800,000 buildings in foreign countries
that are now occupied by us military establishments. And [America still
maintains large forces in Germany, Japan, and Korea, with tens of
thousands of troops permanently on duty]{.underline} (and making
mischief, as two us servicemen recently ran over and killed two Korean
girls, provoking massive demonstrations). [After the first Gulf War the
us military became installed in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait]{.underline}, in
which latter place it currently occupies one quarter of the country --
750 square miles devoted to military activity. This huge investment is
no doubt determined by proximity to Iraq. Again, after going to war in
Kosovo, the us left behind an enormous base in a place called Bondsteel.
[These self-expanding sites of **militarism are permanent goads to
terrorist organizations**]{.underline}. Recall that [one of]{.underline}
Osama [bin Laden's professed motivations for al-Qaeda's attacks on
American facilities was the presence of us bases in his home country of
Saudi Arabia. The bases are also **permanent hazards to the
environment**]{.underline} -- indeed, [the us]{.underline}, with some
800,000 buildings on these military sites, [is the world's largest
polluter and the largest consumer of fossil fuels. With territorial
expansion of the us military apparatus, there is a corresponding
expansion of mission]{.underline}. For instance, in Colombia, where
[billions of]{.underline} us [dollars are spent in the "War on
Drugs,"]{.underline} us troops are now being asked to take care of
pipelines through which vital oil reserves are passing. In addition,
[the War on Drugs is now subsumed into the War Against Terror. The
signifier of Terror has virtually unlimited elasticity, for once an
apparatus reaches the size of the us military machine, **threats can be
seen anywhere**]{.underline}. With the inauguration of the new hard-line
president of Colombia, Alvaro Uribe, the us authorized the use of 1.7
billion dollars in military aid hitherto limited to anti-drug operations
for direct attacks on deeply entrenched farc guerrillas. This
redirection of aid came after Colombian officials and their American
supporters in the Congress and Bush administration argued that the
change was needed as part of the global campaign against terrorism.
Within this overall picture, [American armed forces are undergoing a
qualitative shift of enormous proportion]{.underline}. In words read by
President Bush: "Our forces in the next century must be agile, lethal,
readily deployable, and must require a minimum of logistical support. We
must be able to project our power over long distances in days or weeks
rather than months. On land our heavy forces must be lighter, our light
forces must be more lethal. All must be easier to deploy." Crossing
Weapons Boundaries -- Both Nuclear and Conventional As a result, [many
boundaries and limits of the bipolar era have been
breached]{.underline}. For example, [the distinction between nuclear and
conventional weapons had always constituted a radical barrier. The
standoff between the us and the ussr was epitomized by mind-numbing
hydrogen bomb-missiles]{.underline} facing each other in a scenario
called "Mutual Assured Destruction.î"In short, [a strategic condition of
deterrence prevailed, which made nuclear weapons seem unthinkable. With
the demise of the ussr, deterrence no longer inhibits us nuclear
weaponry, and the weapons themselves have proliferated downward,
becoming miniaturized and increasingly tactical rather than
strategic]{.underline}. Meanwhile, the genie of [the weapons
industries]{.underline} has [developed ever more destructive
"conventional" weapons]{.underline}. These include non-explosive devices
of awesome power, such as laser beams, microwaves, and large-scale
climate manipulation, along with a new generation of super-powerful
explosive devices. Thus [the strongest non-nuclear weapons are now
considerably more lethal than the least powerful nuclear weapons, making
the latter thinkable and eliminating a major barrier against their
employment]{.underline}. These [so-called conventional bombs have
already been used]{.underline}, for example, [in Afghanistan, where the
us employed]{.underline} a gigantic explosive weapon, called
[a]{.underline} ì[Bunker Buster]{.underline}î [to root out al-Qaeda
combatants in underground bunkers]{.underline}. They are based upon the
"daisy cutter," a giant bomb about the size of a Volkswagen Beetle and
capable of destroying everything within a square kilometer.
Significantly, the model used in Afghanistan, the B61-11, already
employs nuclear technology, the infamous depleted uranium warhead,
capable by virtue of its extreme density, of great penetrating power.
[Depleted uranium]{.underline} (du) [is a by-product of the nuclear
power industry]{.underline} (chiefly being U-238 created in the
extraction of U-235 from naturally occurring uranium ore). [Over 500,000
tons of deadly du have accumulated and 4-5,000 more tons are being
produced every year]{.underline}. Like all products of the nuclear power
industry, [du poses immense challenges of disposal. It has this peculiar
property of being almost twice as dense as lead and it is radioactive
with a half-life of 4.5 billion years. Wherever depleted uranium is
used, it has another peculiar property of exploding]{.underline},
vaporizing at 56 degrees centigrade, which is just like a little more
than half the way to boiling water. [So it is very volatile, it
explodes, it forms dust and powders that are inhaled, disburses widely,
and produces lethal cancers, birth defects, and so forth for 4.5 billion
years]{.underline}. [In the case of depleted uranium, the challenge of
disposal was met by incorporating the refuse]{.underline} from the
ìpeacefulî branch of nuclear technology [into the war-making branch.
Already used in anti-tank projectiles]{.underline} in the first Iraq war
(approximately 300 tons worth) and again in Yugoslavia (approximately
10-15 tons were used in each of the various Yugoslav wars), [it is
presumed]{.underline}, although the defense department coyly denies it,
[that this material was also used in]{.underline} the
[Afghanistan]{.underline} war. **[Depleted uranium has spread a plague
of radioactivity and further rationalized the use of nuclear weapons as
such]{.underline}**. Consequently, the B61-11 is about to be replaced
with the BLU113, where the bunker buster will now be a small nuclear
weapon, almost certainly spear-tipped with du. Pollutants to Earth and
Space To the boundaries crossed between nuclear and non-nuclear weapons,
and between the peaceful and militaristic uses of atomic technology, we
need to add those between earth and its lower atmosphere on the one
hand, and space on the other. [The administration is poised
to]{.underline} realize the crackpot and deadly schemes of the Reagan
administration to [militarize space and to draw the rest of the world
into the scheme, as client and]{.underline} [victim]{.underline}. In
November 2002, Bush proposed that nato allies build missile defense
systems, with components purchased, needless to add, from Boeing,
Raytheon, etc, even as Congress was approving a fiscal 2003 defense
budget containing \$7.8 billion authorization for missile defense
research and procurement, as part of the \$238 billion set aside for
Star Wars over the next 20 years. The administration now is poised to
realize the crackpot and deadly schemes of the Reagan administration to
militarize space and to draw the rest of the world into the scheme, as
client and victim. [A new missile defense system bureaucracy has
risen]{.underline}. It is currently developing such wild items as
something called ìbrilliant pebblesî which involves the release of
endless numbers of mini satellites into outer space. [All of this was to
protect the world against the threat of rogue states such as North
Korea]{.underline}. As the Seattle Times reported, the us expects the
final declaration to, "express the need to examine options to protect
allied forces, territories, and population centers against the full
range of missile threats." As an official put it, "This will establish
the framework within which nato allies could work cooperatively toward
fielding the required capabilities. With the us withdrawal this year
from the anti-ballistic treaty with Russia, it is no longer a question
of whether missile defenses will be deployed. The relevant questions are
now what, how, and when. The train is about to pull out of the station;
we invite our friends, allies, and the Russian Federation to climb on
board." [The destination of this train is defensive only in the
Orwellian sense, as the missiles will be used to defend]{.underline} us
troops in the field. In other words, they will be used to defend [armies
engaged in offensive activities]{.underline}. What is being "defended"
by the Strategic Defense Initiative (sdi), therefore, is the initiative
to make war everywhere. [Space has now become the ultimate
battlefield]{.underline}. And not just with use of these missiles. The
High Frequency Active Aural Research Program (haarp) is also part of
sdi. [This amounts to weather warfare: deliberately manipulating climate
to harm and destroy adversaries]{.underline}. A very dubious enterprise,
to say the least, in an age when [global warming and climate instability
are already looming as two of the greatest problems facing
civilizatio]{.underline}n. The chief feature is a network of powerful
antennas capable of creating controlled local modifications of the
ionosphere and hence producing weather disturbances and so forth. All of
these technical interventions are accompanied by many kinds of
institutional and political changes. The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, nasa, for instance, is now a partner in the development
of this strategic defense initiative. The very way in which the United
Nations was drawn into the resolution in the war against Iraq is a
breach and a violation of the original un Charter, which is to never
make war, never to threaten to make war on any member state. The un was
a peacemaking institution, but now the Super power has forced it into
its orbit. The scrapping of the abm and other elements of the treaty
structure (non- proliferation, test-ban) that had organized the world of
the Cold War is one part of a process of shedding whatever might inhibit
the cancerous growth of militarism. [It also creates **an atmosphere of
general lawlessness** in the world. This is felt at all
levels]{.underline}ó[from]{.underline} [the rise of an ultra-militarist
clique in the White House to the formal renunciation of
n]{.underline}o-[f]{.underline}irst-[u]{.underline}se [nuclear
strategy]{.underline}, the flouting of numerous un regulations, [the
doctrine of pre-emptive war, and]{.underline}, as the logical outcome of
all these developments, [the **condition of Permanent War** and its
accompaniment of general lawlessness, media slavishness, and a wave of
repression]{.underline} for whose parallel we have to go back to the
Alien and Sedition acts of the 1790s, or Trumanís loyalty oaths of 1947.
[**Militarism cannot be reduced to politics, economics, technology,
culture, or psychology**. All these are parts of the machine, make the
machine go around, and are themselves produced by the actions of the
machine. There is no doubt]{.underline}, in this regard, [that the
machine runs on natural resources]{.underline} (which have to be secured
by economic, political, and military action), [and that it is deeply
embedded in the ruling corporate order. There is no contradiction here,
but a set of meshing parts, driven by an insensate demand for fossil
fuel energy]{.underline}. As a man from Amarillo, Texas put it when
interviewed by npr as to the correctness of Bush's plan to go to war in
Iraq: "I agree with the president, because how else are we going to get
the oil to fly the F-16s?" **[We go to war]{.underline}**, in other
words, **[to get the oil needed to go to war]{.underline}**. A Who's Who
List of mic Beneficiaries The fact that our government is front-loaded
with oil magnates is another part of the machine. It is of interest,
therefore, that Unocal, for example, celebrated Condoleezza Riceís
ascendancy to the post of National Security Advisor by naming an oil
tanker after her. Or that Dick Cheney, originally a poor boy, became a
rich man after the first Gulf War, when he switched from being Secretary
of Defense, in charge of destroying the Kuwait oil fields, to ceo of a
then-smallish company, Halliburton, in charge of rebuilding the same oil
fields. Or that G.W. Bush himself, aside from his failed venture with
Harken Oil, is scion of a family and a dynasty that controls the Carlyle
Group, founded in 1987 by a former Carter administration official.
Carlyle is now worth over \$13 billion and its high officials include
President Bush I, his Secretary of State (and fixer of the coup that put
Bush II in power) James Baker, Reaganís Secretary of Defense Frank
Carlucci, former British Prime Minister John Major, and former
Phillipine President Fidel Ramos, among others. The Carlyle Group has
its fingers everywhere, including ìdefenseî, where it controls firms
making vertical missile launch systems currently in use on us Navy ships
in the Arabian sea, as well as a range of other weapons delivery systems
and combat vehicles. And as a final touch which the worldís people would
be much better off for knowing, there are very definite connections
between Carlyle and the family of Osama bin Laden -- a Saudi power whose
fortunes have been fused with those of the United States since the end
of World War II. Thus the military-industrial complex lives, breathes,
and takes on new dimensions. There is a deep structural reason for the
present explosion of us militarism, most clearly traceable in the
activities of Vice President Cheney, made clear in the energy report
that he introduced with the generous assistance of Enron executives in
May 2001. According to the report, American reliance on imported oil
will rise by from about 52 percent of total consumption in 2001 to an
estimated 66 percent in 2020. The reason for this is that world
production, in general, and domestic production in particular are going
to remain flat (and, although the report does not discuss this, begin
dropping within the next 20 years). Meanwhile consumptionówhich is a
direct function of the relentless drive of capitalism to expand
commodity productionóis to grow by some two- thirds. Because the usage
of oil must rise in the worldview of a Cheney, the us will actually have
to import 60 percent more oil in 2020 to keep itself going than it does
today. This means that imports will have to rise from their current rate
of about 10.4 million barrels per day to about 16.7 million barrels per
day. In the words of the report: "The only way to do this is persuade
foreign suppliers to increase their production to sell more of their
output to the us." The meaning of these words depends of course on the
interpretation of "persuade", which in the us lexicon is to be read, I
should think, as requiring a sufficient military machine to coerce
foreign suppliers. At that point they might not even have to sell their
output to the us, as it would already be possessed by the superpower.
Here we locate the root material fact underlying recent us expansionism.
This may seem an extravagant conclusion. However an explicit connection
to militarismóand Iraqóhad been supplied the month before, in April
2001, in another report prepared by James Baker and submitted to the
Bush cabinet. This document, called "Strategic Energy Policy Challenges
for the 21st Century," concludes with refreshing candor that ìthe us
remains a prisoner of its energy dilemma, Iraq remains a destabilizing
influence to the flow of oil to international markets from the Middle
East, Saddam Hussein has also demonstrated a willingness to threaten to
use the oil weapon and to use his own export program to manipulate oil
markets, therefore the us should conduct an immediate policy review
toward Iraq, including military, energy, economic, and political
diplomatic assessments. Note the absence of reference to "weapons of
mass destruction," or aid to terrorism, convenient rationalizations can
be filled in later. Clearly, however things turn out with Iraq, [the
fundamental structural dilemma driving the military machine pertains to
the contradictions of an empire that drives toward the **invasion of all
social space** and the **total control over nature**. Since the former
goal meets up with unending resistance and the latter crashes against
the finitude of the material world, there is no recourse except the
**ever-widening resort to force**. But this, the military monster
itself, ever seeking threats to feed upon, becomes a fresh source of
danger, whether of **nuclear war, terror, or ecological
breakdown**]{.underline}. [**The situation is plainly unsustainable**, a
series of disasters waiting to happen. It can only be checked and
brought to rationality by a global uprising of people who demand an end
to the regime of endless war. This is the only possible path by which we
can pull ourselves away from the abyss into which the military machine
is about to plunge, dragging us all down with it]{.underline}.

### Human Security Good

#### Human security as a framework outweighs their impacts and is necessary to confront different forms of violence---war, environmental destruction, genocide, etc. on its own terms. 

Patrick **HAYDEN** IR @ St. Andrews **04** "Constraining War: Human
Security and the Human Right to Peace" *Human Rights Review*
October-December p.38-40

The more expansive formulation of **[human security represents a
radically different approach to security from that offered by the
traditional realist security paradigm]{.underline}**. The fundamental
difference in orientation between the two approaches is that for [the
traditional paradigm security means the protection and welfare of the
state *per se*, whereas for the new formulation security means the
protection and welfare of the individual human being.]{.underline} While
the classical paradigm is clearly realist in that it is narrowly
preoccupied with the state and national security interests, the human
security paradigm is consistent with cosmopolitanism in that it adopts a
more comprehensive approach concerned in the first instance with persons
and threats to their existence and dignity.10 It should be noted that
[the human security paradigm does not suggest that national security
becomes irrelevant; rather it becomes embedded within a wider framework
of interests that takes **the quality of life** of the individual human
being and the justice of fundamental social institutions as **primary
components of security** viewed holistically.]{.underline} Along with
the end of the cold war and its "great powers" rivalry, the past decade
has seen increased recognition of a number of phenomena associated with
globalization that challenge many of the norms enshrined in the
Westphalian system. [The entrenchment of global capitalism]{.underline},
the [internationalization of telecommunications and media]{.underline},
the explosive [growth of supranational organizations and transnational
corporations]{.underline}, [the intensified flows of people, fashions,
drugs, weapons and culture across borders, and the rise of global
terrorism]{.underline}, all [have undermined the traditional claims that
the state alone is able to guarantee the physical security, order, and
integrity of a given territory, and of the people who reside within
it]{.underline}. It seems that not only is the state not as
"self-reliant" as it is portrayed to be by realists, but recent changes
in the inteInstitute of Social and Political Sciences, Lisbon Technical
Universityrnational system and how world politics is conducted---which
include processes and agents of [**integration as well as
fragmentation**---demonstrate a plethora of challenges to the very
existence of individuals and communities that are incapable of being
addressed on the basis of the state-centric assumptions of the national
security paradigm.]{.underline} Given the institutional and processual
transformations occurring in conjunction with globalization, appealing
to realist orthodoxy as a basis upon which to construct genuinely secure
modes of human existence has become increasingly implausible. Former
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy, who became well known for his
advancement of the human security concept during his diplomatic career,
captured the cosmopolitan character of human security when he observed
[that threats to human security are those that "strike directly home to
the individual]{.underline}" and "largely ignore state boundaries."
[Such threats are often violent and systemic in nature, and require
"action and cooperation at different levels--- **global, regional, and
local**---if they are to be tackled effectively]{.underline}."11 [Human
security concerns transcend the traditional statist confines of national
security, and tend to focus on elimination or prevention of the causes
of threats to human security.]{.underline} The types of threats
identified with the human security concept include armed conflict,
[ethnocultural]{.underline} [violence, genocide, terrorism]{.underline},
violent crime, [slavery]{.underline}, [government repression,
discrimination, environmental degradation, deprivation of basic
needs]{.underline}, underdevelopment, and the [spread of small
arms,]{.underline} [nuclear weapons,]{.underline} and other weapons of
mass destruction. In sum, for the human security concept, the core
threats are those that present a clear and consistent (and, sadly,
preventable) danger to "human life and dignity."12 Another way of
putting these last points is that [human security "recognises that an
individual's personal protection and preservation comes not just from
the safeguarding of the state as a political unit, but also from access
to individual welfare and **the quality of life**.]{.underline}"13
Consequently, [the human security approach is concerned with both direct
and indirect violence, or **organized and "structural"
violence**]{.underline}, none of the forms of which can be understood in
exclusively national or territorial terms and many of which are
exacerbated by the statist biases of conventional international
politics. In addition to the commonly recognized forms of direct
violence (such as international and domestic war, genocide, and ethnic
cleansing) other forms of direct violence (including slavery, physical
abuse, crime, and terrorism) along with forms of structural violence
(such as political repression, discrimination, and the lack of food,
water, and basic health care) are all identified as critical threats to
personal safety, well-being, and dignity. Because the new security
paradigm places the individual's well-being and dignity within the
context of humanity rather than the sovereign state, the normative focus
of realism gives way to that of cosmopolitanism. The security referent
is no longer the citizen of a particular sovereign state, but all
persons understood as "members of a transcendent human community with
common global concerns."14 [Security is not the domain of a privileged
few, but the entitlement of all]{.underline} human beings. Neither is
[the goal of security]{.underline} simply the preservation of the state
(or the society of states); rather it [is the preservation of human
well-being. The normative focus also shifts from that of power struggles
and unilateral militarism as the means by which to obtain national
security, towards recognition that genuine security can only be ensured
through multilateral efforts aimed at evading or curtailing war and
other forms of direct and indirect violence,]{.underline} protecting
human rights, [and providing the social and environmental resources
needed for a safe and dignified human life.]{.underline} In short, human
security is inseparable from conditions of peace.

### Governmentality IL

#### Arms limitations continue the same logic -- certain groups controlling the means of violence.

Keith **Krause 11**. Professor at the Graduate Institute of
International and Development Studies in Geneva. Leashing the Dogs of
War: Arms Control from Sovereignty to Governmentality. Contemporary
Security Policy, Vol.32, No.1 (April 2011), pp.20--39 ISSN 1352-3260
print

21st Century Arms Control: Towards Obsolescence or Expansion? How, if at
all, is this relevant to 21st century challenges of controlling the
possession and use of the means of violence? [Viewed narrowly as a
policy-relevant and technocratic means of regulating military
competition between states]{.underline} [to minimize]{.underline} the
risk of accidental violent [conflict]{.underline} (or to reduce the
overall risk of conflict), [the arms control paradigm is
intellectually]{.underline}, although not necessarily practically or
politically, [exhausted]{.underline}. There remains much practical
negotiation and work to be done on such things as a fissile material cut
off treaty, further reductions in the American and Russian nuclear
arsenals (especially of tactical nuclear weapons), and efforts to
maintain the somewhat shaky edifice of nuclear non-proliferation. Other
initiatives, such as restrictions on the weaponization of space, or on
ballistic missile defences, seem less relevant to 21st century
geopolitical realities, in which the risk of inter-state war is
relatively minor, while the risk of large-scale intra-state and
non-state violence remains. What the complete paralysis of the
Geneva-based Conference on Disarmament and the non-events of the past
two decades (since the signing of the Chemical Weapons Convention in
1993) have highlighted is the way in which [arms control]{.underline}
[as narrowly conceived was a product of particular geopolitical
conditions and presuppositions that gave rise to certain kinds of
multilateral measures]{.underline}, based on shared understandings of
the significance of stability and balance, transparency, equality,
hierarchy, and the technological potential of nuclear weapons. All of
these understandings have been challenged in different ways by states
such as India, Pakistan, China, Egypt, North Korea, or Iran, often for
reasons of national or strategic interests, but also because they reject
the way in which traditional arms control practices reinforced and
legitimated particular sovereign understandings of who could (and could
not) possess, use, or threaten to use, particular weapons.30
[But]{.underline} I argue that **[arms control practices can also be
viewed more broadly through the lens of
governmentality]{.underline}**.31 To begin, [the regulation of and
control over]{.underline} the use of lethal [violence]{.underline} [was
not]{.underline}, since the early 20th century[, just about inter-state
military competition.]{.underline} [It was also about a set of social
and institutional practices that imposed certain understandings about
the rules for the use of force in international society]{.underline},
[that reinforced the state\'s monopoly of legitimate use of
force]{.underline} both internally and externally, and that manifest
themselves through particular forms of management of a given territory,
population and resources. [Thus, even though]{.underline} some of [the
new frontiers of contemporary arms control do not have the same
practical manifestations]{.underline} or targets, nor even the same
actors engaged in promoting arms control, [they can be understood as
sharing the same premises about state power and violence]{.underline}.
On this broader account, **[one could redefine arms control as being
about who can possess, use, develop and transfer the technologies of
violence, under what circumstances, against whom, and for what
ends]{.underline}**? **[And the (critical) scholarly question is then:
what are the consequences and effects of the legitimization of
particular configurations and distributions of technologies of
violence?]{.underline}** In this light, a wide range of contemporary
international practices, include such things as the bans on
anti-personnel landmines and cluster munitions, post-conflict weapons
collection and destruction efforts, disarmament, demobilization and
reintegration programmes (DDR), and security sector reform (SSR)
[initiatives]{.underline} all [can be considered as new manifestations
of arms control as governmentality]{.underline}. Some have argued that
[these types of measures reflect a shift towards humanitarian
disarm]{.underline}ament, [or 'disarmament as humanitarian action', and
aim to reclaim the disarmament side of the arms-control and disarmament
divide.]{.underline}32 I would argue, however, that **[despite some
significant differences in focus and targets, there is a great deal of
continuity with the logic of governmentality]{.underline}** that emerged
in the latter stages of Cold War arms control practices.

### Structural Violence Outweighs

#### Structural violence locks in social and environmental tension---culminates in extinction and makes war inevitable

\(1\) It' s a common place that [human [society can
**survive**]{.mark}]{.underline} and develop [[only
in]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[lasting]{.mark} real [peace]{.mark}. Without
peace countries cannot develop. Although since 1945 there has been no
world war, but]{.underline} • numerous [local wars took
place]{.underline}, • [terrorism]{.underline} has [spread]{.underline}
all over the world, undermining security even in the most developed and
powerful countries, • [arms race and militarisation have]{.underline}

continued, extending]{.underline} also [to w]{.underline}eapons of

resources badly needed for development]{.underline}, • many
**[["invisible wars"]{.underline}]{.mark}**1 [[are suffered by
the]{.mark} poor and [oppressed]{.mark} people, [manifested in
mass]{.mark} misery, [poverty]{.mark}, unemployment, homelessness,
[starvation]{.mark} and malnutrition, [epidemics]{.mark} and poor health
conditions, exploitation and oppression, [racial]{.mark} and other
[discrimination]{.mark}, physical terror, organised
injustice]{.underline}, disguised forms of violence, the denial or
regular infringement of the democratic rights of citizens, women, youth,
ethnic or religious minorities, etc., [[and]{.mark} last but not least,
in the degradation of human environment, which means]{.underline} that •
**[[the "war against Nature"]{.underline}]{.mark}**, i.e. [[the
disturbance of ecological balance]{.mark}, wasteful management of
natural resources, and [large-scale pollution]{.mark} of our
environment, [is]{.mark} still [going on, causing]{.mark} also losses
and [fatal dangers]{.mark} for human life]{.underline}.
[[Behind]{.underline}]{.mark} global terrorism and [["invisible wars"
we]{.mark} find striking international and intra society
[inequities]{.mark} and distorted development patterns]{.underline} 2 ,
[[which]{.mark} tend to [generate social]{.mark} as well as
international [tensions]{.mark}]{.underline}, thus **[[paving the way
for]{.underline}]{.mark}** unrest and **[["visible"
wars]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It is a commonplace now that [peace is not
merely the absence of war. The prerequisites of a lasting [peace]{.mark}
between and within societies [involve]{.mark}]{.underline} not only -
though, of course, necessarily - [demilitarisation]{.underline}, but
[also a [systematic]{.mark} and gradual [elimination of the roots of
violence]{.mark}, of the causes of "invisible wars", of the structural
and institutional bases of large-scale international and intra-society
inequalities, exploitation and oppression. Peace requires a process
of]{.underline} social and national [emancipation]{.underline}, a
progressive, democratic transformation of societies and the world
bringing about equal rights and opportunities for all people, sovereign
participation and mutually advantageous co-operation among nations. It
further requires a pluralistic democracy on global level with an
appropriate system of proportional representation of the world society,
articulation of diverse interests and their peaceful reconciliation, by
non-violent conflict management, and thus also a global governance with
a really global institutional system. Under the contemporary conditions
of accelerating globalisation and deepening global interdependencies in
our world, [[peace]{.underline}]{.mark} is indivisible in both time and
space. It [[cannot exist if reduced to a period]{.mark} only [after or
before war, and **cannot be safeguarded in one part of the world**
when]{.mark} some [others suffer]{.mark} visible or invisible
wars]{.underline}. Thus, [peace requires]{.underline}, indeed,
[a]{.underline} new, [demilitarised and democratic world order, which
can provide equal opportunities]{.underline} for sustainable
development. "Sustainability of development" (both on national and world
level) is often interpreted as an issue of environmental protection only
and reduced to the need for preserving the ecological balance and
delivering the next generations not a destroyed Nature with over
exhausted resources and polluted environment. However, [no ecological
balance can be ensured, unless]{.underline} the deep international
development gap and intra-society [inequalities are substantially
reduced]{.underline}. Owing to global interdependencies there may exist
hardly any "zero-sum-games", in which one can gain at the expense of
others, but, instead, [the "negative-sum-games" tend to predominate, in
which everybody must suffer, later or sooner]{.underline}, directly or
indirectly, losses. Therefore, [[the actual question is]{.mark} not
[about]{.mark} "sustainability of development" but rather about the
"sustainability of human life", i.e. **[survival of
\[hu\]mankind]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- because of ecological imbalance
and globalised terrorism. When Professor Louk de la Rive Box was the
president of EADI, one day we had an exchange of views on the state and
future of development studies. We agreed that development studies are
not any more restricted to the case of underdeveloped countries, as the
developed ones (as well as the former "socialist" countries) are also
facing development problems, such as those of structural and
institutional (and even system-) transformation, requirements of changes
in development patterns, and concerns about natural environment. While
all these are true, today I would dare say that besides (or even instead
of) "development studies" we must speak about and make "survival
studies". While the monetary, financial, and debt crises are cyclical,
[we live in an almost permanent crisis of the world society, which is
multidimensional]{.underline} in nature, [involving not only economic
but also socio-psychological, behavioural, cultural and political
aspects. The narrow-minded]{.underline}, election-oriented, [selfish
behaviour motivated by thirst for power and wealth, which still
characterise the political leadership almost all over the world, paves
the way for the final, last catastrophe]{.underline}. One cannot doubt,
of course, that great many positive historical changes have also taken
place in the world in the last century. Such as decolonisation,
transformation of socio-economic systems, democratisation of political
life in some former fascist or authoritarian states,
institutionalisation of welfare policies in several countries, rise of
international organisations and new forums for negotiations, conflict
management and cooperation, institutionalisation of international
assistance programmes by multilateral agencies, codification of human
rights, and rights of sovereignty and democracy also on international
level, collapse of the militarised Soviet bloc and system-change3 in the
countries concerned, the end of cold war, etc., to mention only a few.
Nevertheless, [the crisis of the world society has extended and
deepened, approaching to a point of bifurcation that necessarily puts an
end to the present tendencies, either by the final catastrophe or a
common solution]{.underline}. Under the circumstances provided by
rapidly progressing science and technological revolutions, [[human
society cannot survive unless]{.mark} such profound intra-society and
international [inequalities]{.mark} prevailing today [are]{.mark} soon
[eliminated]{.mark}]{.underline}. Like a single spacecraft, the
[[**Earth can no longer afford** to have]{.underline}]{.mark} a \'crew\'
divided into [[two parts]{.underline}]{.mark}: the rich, privileged,
well- fed, well-educated, on the one hand, and the poor, deprived,
starving, sick and uneducated, on the other. Dangerous
\'zero-sum-games\' (which mostly prove to be "negative-sum-games") can
hardly be played any more by visible or invisible wars in the world
society. Because of global interdependencies, [the apparent winner
becomes]{.underline} also [a loser]{.underline}. The real choice for the
world society is between negative- and positive-sum-games: i.e. between,
on the one hand, continuation of visible and "invisible wars", as long
as this is possible at all, and, on the other, transformation of the
world order by demilitarisation and democratization. [No ideological or
terminological camouflage can conceal this real dilemma any more, which
is to be faced]{.underline} not in the distant future, by the next
generations, but [in the coming years]{.underline}, because of global
terrorism soon having nuclear and other mass destructive weapons, and
also due to irreversible changes in natural environment.

### Rhetorical Focus Good

#### Debating the rhetorical *frame* for war is the only way to address the sources of war

Inquiry into the New War Rhetoric" *Quarterly Journal of Speech* 99 (2)
p.230-231

[The **framing** of public discussion facilitates
acquiescence]{.underline} [in contemporary wartime]{.underline}: thus,
[both the grounds on which war has been **justified** and the ends
toward which war is **adjusted** are **bracketed**]{.underline} and
hence made infandous. The [rhetorics of acquiescence bury the grounds
for war under nearly impermeable layers of political presentism and keep
the ends of war in a state of **perpetual flux** so that they cannot be
**challenged**]{.underline}. Specific details of the war effort are
excised from the public realm through the rhetorical maneuver of
''occultatio,'' and the authors of such violence\*the president, his
administration, and the broader national security establishment\*use a
wide range of techniques to displace their own responsibility in the
orchestration of war.28 Freed from the need to cultivate assent,
acquiescent rhetorics take the form of a status update: hence, President
Obama's March 28, 2011 speech on Libya, framed as an ''update'' to
Americans ten days after the bombs of ''Operation Odyssey Dawn'' had
begun to fall. Such post facto discourse is a new norm: Americans are
called to acquiesce to decisions already made and actions already taken.
The Obama Administration has obscured the very definition of ''war''
with euphemisms like ''limited kinetic action.'' The original
obfuscation, the ''war on terror,'' is a perpetually shifting, ends-less
conflict that denies the very status of war. How do you dissent from
something that seems so overwhelming, so inexorable? It's hard to hit a
perpetually shifting target. Moreover, as the government has become
increasingly secretive about the details of war, crucial information is
kept from citizens\*or its revelation is branded ''treason,'' as in the
WikiLeaks case\*making it much more challenging to dissent. Furthermore,
government surveillance of citizens cows citizens into quietism. So
what's the point of dissent? After all, this, too, will pass. Thus even
the most critical citizens come to rest in peace with war. The
confidence game of the new war rhetoric is one of perpetually shifting
ends. In this ''post-9/11'' paradigm of war rhetoric, citizens are
rarely asked to harness their civic energy to support the war effort,
but instead are called to passively cede their wills to a greater Logos,
the machinery of ends-less war. President Obama has embodied the
dramatic role of wartime caretaker more adeptly than his predecessor,
repeatedly exhorting citizens to ''look forward'' rather than to examine
the historical grounds upon which the present state of ends-less war was
founded and institutionalized.29 All the while, that forward horizon is
constantly being reshaped\*from retribution, to prevention, to
disarmament, to democratization, to intervention, and so on, as needed.
What Max Weber called ''charisma of office''\*the phenomenon whereby
extraordinary political power is passed on between charismatically
inflected leaders\*is here cast in bold relief: [until and unless the
grounds of the new war rhetoric are meaningfully represented and
unapologetically challenged, ends-less war can only continue
unabated]{.underline}.30 [War rhetoric is a mode of display that aims to
dispose audiences to certain ways and states of being in the
world]{.underline}. This, in turn, is the essence of the new war
rhetoric: authorities tell us, don't worry, we've got this, just go
about your everyday business, go to the mall, and take a vacation. What
we are calling acquiescent rhetorics aim to disempower citizens by
cultivating passivity and numbness. Acquiescent rhetorics facilitate war
by shutting down inquiry and deliberation and, as such, are anathema to
rhetoric's nobler, democratic ends. [Rhetorical scholars thus have an
important job to do.We must bring]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
objective [violence of war out into the open so that all affected by war
can meaningfully question the grounds, means, and ends of
battle]{.underline}.We can do this by describing, and demobilizing, the
rhetorics used to promote acquiescence. In sum, we believe that [by
making the seemingly uncontestable contestable, rhetorical critics can
and should begin to invent a pedagogy that would reactivate an
acquiescent public by creating space for talk where we have previously
been content to remain silent.]{.underline}

### AT: Aff Solves War

#### Less weapons & Arm Sales doesn't lessen instability

Toronto. Rethinking Disarmament: The Role of Weapons in the Resolution
of Internal Armed Conflicts. Dissertation -- University of Toronto,

This research aims to shed light on both the theory and practice of
disarmament, in particular the many difficulties associated with its
implementation. [Despite the emergence of disarmament as a strong
norm,]{.underline} or perhaps because of it, **[belligerents tend to
stubbornly cling to their weapons]{.underline}** (Knight, 2004, p. 503).
[The widespread failure to collect weapons]{.underline}, however[, is
often neglected or downplayed,]{.underline} [and has not prompted a
systematic reevaluation]{.underline} [of the core assumptions underlying
disarmament]{.underline}. In fact, [practitioners and theorists alike
are often single-mindedly focused on devising new strategies to disarm
combatants instead of stopping to question the necessity of
disarmament]{.underline} for the successful resolution of internal
conflict (these efforts are dubbed the "second generation of
disarmament"). For example, the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations
recently released a report based on lessons learned from recent on-the
ground experience (\"Second Generation Disarmament, Demobilization and
Reintegration (DDR) Practices in Peace Operations,\" 2010). In it, the
UN recommends, a new focus on disarming women, children, and gangs, not
just military structures. While the UN and others have spent
considerable time and energy trying to improve the practice of
disarmament, these efforts have done little to remediate one
particularly crucial underlying problem: **[Disarmament often
generates]{.underline}** **[rather than resolves feelings of insecurity
by leaving belligerents defenseless and vulnerable to attack should
conflict resume (as they so often do)]{.underline}**. [The fear of
insecurity is often what triggers belligerents to resist or undermine
disarmament efforts and withhold weapons]{.underline}. [Instead of being
a necessary condition for internal conflict resolution,]{.underline} as
its proponents hold, [disarmament might actually act to constrain the
prospects for peace]{.underline}. Rather than trying to improve the
practice of disarmament, therefore, this research aims to rethink it
altogether. [With the aid of elite interviews, historical and
contemporary research, and the extensive use of
counterfactuals,]{.underline} I will argue that **[disarmament is
neither necessary nor sufficient for the resolution of internal
conflict]{.underline}**. [Conflict can and]{.underline} (to a lesser
extent) [does get resolved]{.underline} [without
disarmament]{.underline}. Indeed, weapons have sometimes played a
productive and even legitimate role in bridging the difficult transition
between war and peace and post-conflict state formation, something that
can be seen more clearly when exploring cases that predate the practice
of disarmament.

### AT: Aff Outweighs

#### Aff can't outweigh -- removing the weapons doesn't remove the SOURCE of insecurity -- they are the tools used to create a feeling -- have to remove the root of human insecurity first -- only a risk the aff worsens the problem

Jamie **Levin 15**. PhD in Political Science from the University of
Toronto. Rethinking Disarmament: The Role of Weapons in the Resolution
of Internal Armed Conflicts. Dissertation -- University of Toronto,
2015.
https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/71021/3/Levin_Jamie_201511_PhD_thesis.pdf.

This study proposes to look at weapons in a new light. [Weapons are not
always destabilizing, as disarmament scholars argue]{.underline}, [but
may]{.underline}, instead, [prove potentially stabilizing and mitigate
the insecurity associated with anarchy]{.underline} (Cooper, 2006, p.
356). [Where belligerents fear that robust security guarantees are not
forthcoming, they may turn to weapons to ensure their
survival]{.underline} (Spear, 2002, p. 156; B. F. Walter, 1997, p. 337;
Weingast, 1998). [Weapons can help actors mitigate their]{.underline}
[insecurity both by providing deterrence]{.underline}, which should
lessen the likelihood of defection, [and by providing defensive
capabilities should an agreement fail and violence reerupt]{.underline}.
In this way, [weapons can be thought of as an insurance
policy]{.underline} against their potential annihilation or
disenfranchisement from the levers of power. (c.f., Cohen, 2001, p. 48
on insurance policies; Stedman, 1997). [Unlike third party guarantees,
that can easily be revoked]{.underline}, [or the norms]{.underline} and
institutions of democracy, [which are slow to mature]{.underline},
**[weapons provide a highly credible last line of defense]{.underline}**
against a peace agreement that goes horribly wrong. [With weapons,
belligerents need not trust their survival on the word of another
party]{.underline}. Instead, [they need rely only on
themselves]{.underline}. In other words, **[weapons are tools of
self-help]{.underline}**, remarkably similar to those that actors under
conditions of international anarchy are said to seek in order to
guarantee their survival (Glassmyer & Sambanis, 2008, p. 382; Waltz,
1979). [The force of arms can be used to provide
protection]{.underline}, repel attacks, hold territory, and extract the
resources necessary for long term survival (see C. Tilly, Evans,
Rueschemeyer, & Skocpol, 1985; Weber, 1978 on coercion and taxation).
[Even small numbers of weapons used by highly motivated
troops]{.underline} [with sufficient knowledge of their surroundings
have managed to repel and,]{.underline} in some cases, [overcome much
stronger adversaries]{.underline} (Arreguin-Toft, 2001; Fearon & Laitin,
2003; Lyall & Wilson, 2009; Mack, 1975; Petraeus & Amos, 2009). [And,
where third parties, democratization, and power sharing require
belligerents to place their trust in others, weapons are self-enforcing
tools of risk management]{.underline}. By providing a last line of
defense, [weapons allow belligerents the ability to take the risks
associated with peacemaking]{.underline}. Without robust guarantees,
such as those provided by weapons, belligerents might simply be
unwilling to enter into negotiations at all or will likely defect from
the terms of the agreement. Hartzell and Hoddie note, "in the absence of
assurances that the process of disarmament . . . will not leave them
vulnerable to future aggression, parties to the conflict often prove
reluctant to either reach or honor negotiated settlements." (2006, p.
156 emphasis added) [Weapons can,]{.underline} therefore, [be thought of
as resolving the prisoner-dilemma]{.underline} like
[scenario]{.underline} outlined by Walter. If combatants retain their
weapons post conflict, they can reduce the possibility of surprise
attack and the permanent exclusion from power. While it is no doubt true
that the tools of war can be used by belligerents to gain strategic
advantage, increase bargaining leverage, or generally derail a peace
process, [weapons]{.underline} also [provide]{.underline}
[insurance]{.underline} against the failure to achieve peace and renewed
conflict. Where they do so and peace obtains, they cannot reasonably be
considered spoilers. In other words, actors might hold onto their
weapons and cease fighting. [That weapons correlate with
instability]{.underline} and the failure of peace [does not mean that
they]{.underline} [are the cause of instability and
failure.]{.underline} In fact, **[the opposite is often
true.]{.underline}** [Conflict]{.underline} also [triggers belligerents
to seek weapons. Groups that feel threatened]{.underline} often turn
inwards and [arm]{.underline} [for]{.underline} [their]{.underline} [own
defense]{.underline} (Hartzell & Hoddie, 2006; Kaufman, 1996a; C.
Kaufmann, 1996; C. D. Kaufmann, 1998; David A Lake & Rothchild, 1996;
Posen, 1993; J. Snyder & Jervis, 1999; Wendt, 1992). [Weapons
are]{.underline}, paradoxically, [both the tools used to wage war as
well as the means to avoid it. Context very much matters.]{.underline}

### AT: We save lives

#### The humanitarian warrant is a necessary component of justifying governmentality -- it's how control is justified

Keith **Krause 11**. Professor at the Graduate Institute of
International and Development Studies in Geneva. Leashing the Dogs of
War: Arms Control from Sovereignty to Governmentality. Contemporary
Security Policy, Vol.32, No.1 (April 2011), pp.20--39 ISSN 1352-3260
print

Of course, [the story of arms control does not begin in the
1950s]{.underline} or 1960s. [Understood broadly as a means of managing
the monopoly over -- and channelling the risk of --violence, state
managers]{.underline} from the earliest historical records [have
attempted to control arms]{.underline}. This took the form of either
confiscating weapons, attempting to restrict the export of know-how and
'embodied technologies' and even, on rare occasions, of attempting to
ban or restrict the use of certain military technologies.8 Most of these
restrictions were imposed by victorious parties on the vanquished after
wars, or as part of the progressive development of the laws of war --
both exercises of sovereign power. What these efforts did not generally
involve, at least until the late 19th century, was formal cooperation
between states in peacetime to regulate their military competition. By
the late 19th century, however, this aspect of arms control moved to the
forefront, and the period between 1899 (the first Hague conference) and
the early 1930s witnessed an explosion of efforts to regulate armaments
and their use. These included the Washington Naval Treaty (1922) (which
was extended throughout the 1920s and early 1930s in a series of
bilateral and multilateral naval agreements), the series of negotiations
in the 1920s on a Convention for the Control of the Trade in Arms and
Ammunition (1919), Convention on the Supervision of the International
Trade in Arms and Ammunition and Implements of War (1925), and
subsequent Draft Convention on the Private Manufacture of Arms and
Ammunition (1929), and the Geneva Protocol (1925) restricting the use of
poison gas. [The Cold War arms control paradigm]{.underline} thus [did
not emerge in a vacuum, and]{.underline} it [demonstrated both elements
of continuity and break with the security and ordering practices of the
interwar period]{.underline}. The first element of continuity was that
[efforts to control arms were meant to preserve, if not reinforce, the
geopolitical hierarchy of global politics]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} the relative **[military advantages of particular
states]{.underline}**. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the
Missile Technology Control regime (MTCR), the Wassenaar arrangement
(military and dual-use technologies), the Nuclear Suppliers Group and
the Australia Group (chemical weapons) all reflected this logic, which
was most clear in the unusual discriminatory treatment that is built
into the NPT between nuclear haves and have-nots. [Arms
control]{.underline} also thus [served to perpetuate certain kinds of
patron-client relations in the global geopolitical system]{.underline},
and to create club goods such that so-called responsible states were
identified as legitimate possessors of certain kinds of technologies
(missile technology, chemical precursors), while others were not. For
example, membership in the various clubs often included judgments about
the legitimacy and illegitimacy of certain kinds of domestic political
arrangements, regarding such things as civilian control of the armed
forces or appropriate forms of domestic political oversight. One example
was the rehabilitation of Argentina and Brazil after the dictatorships
and their joining of the NPT. Another aspect included explicit
acceptance of the logic of the deterrence/arms control paradigm itself,
reflected most often by participation in the 'epistemic community of
arms control' at the national and international level, and its
conventional understandings of what constituted acceptable nuclear
policies.9 This notion that [arms control was]{.underline} not just an
exercise of sovereign rule between equals, but a reflection of deeper
forms of self-restraint over the use of force (domestically and
internationally) opened the door towards the different (governmental)
understanding of arms control that I sketch out below. The second
element of continuity was **[that arms control measures often had a sort
of humanitarian subtext]{.underline}**, that echoed earlier restrictions
on the civilized use of weapons, [such as the banning]{.underline} at
the Second Lateran council of the use [of crossbows]{.underline} against
Christians, or the general opprobrium that greeted the spread of
firearms on the battlefield. From the 1899 and 1907 Hague conferences,
on forward to the debate around dum-dum bullets and chemical weapons in
the first half of the 20th century, to contemporary debates on land
mines, cluster munitions and the treaty on Certain Conventional Weapons
(CCW), particular tropes concerning inhumane and unacceptable ways of
killing and injuring people have been deployed.10 These include such
things as the ban on chemical weapons, on blinding lasers, and on
anti-personnel landmines. [This humanitarian subtext]{.underline} to
most of these measures [was an important part of the civilizing
discourse of warfare, but was]{.underline} therefore also **[part of the
broader devil\'s bargain of international humanitarian
law.]{.underline}** The principle of international humanitarian law,
which protects some groups of people from some forms of weapons or
violence, may also have made certain forms of inter-state war-fighting
more palatable or acceptable, rather than challenging in any fundamental
way the relationship between states, citizens, and violence. It may also
have channelled military innovation in certain directions, without
necessarily having restricted overall the destructiveness of the weapons
that were deployed.11 This second element is not entirely coherent with
a purely sovereign system of rule, and its emergence in the mid19th
century (with the founding of the International Committee of the Red
Cross and progressive codification of international humanitarian law)
reflects more the slow emergence of a system of rule that goes beyond
the assertion of sovereignty and the relatively simple regulation of
competitive relations between states, towards a more diffuse form of
governmentality that focusses on 'more subtle methods of power exercised
through a network of institutions, practices, procedures and techniques
which act to regulate social conduct'.12 [Sovereign power was to be
subjected to self-control and the regulation of behaviour]{.underline}
-- of individual soldiers on the battlefield and of statesmen directing
military machines.

### AT: Aff solves Militarism

#### Can't stop funding militaries -- too many classified and non-subsidized programs

**I.C.I.J. 14**. The International Consortium of Investigative
Journalists. A CITIZEN'S GUIDE TO UNDERSTANDING U.S. FOREIGN MILITARY
AID. May 19, 2014.
<https://publicintegrity.org/national-security/a-citizens-guide-to-understanding-u-s-foreign-military-aid/>.

[There is no single, accepted definition of the terms "foreign aid"
or]{.underline} even "foreign [military aid" or "military
assistance."]{.underline} [For]{.underline} a government as large as
that of [the United States, it's virtually impossible to track all of
the various f]{.underline}ederal agencies' [programs]{.underline} across
countries and sectors to arrive at a single number [that captures the
true amount of]{.underline} U.S. taxpayer [dollars]{.underline} [going
to foreign]{.underline} governments, or even just their
[militaries]{.underline}. For the "Collateral Damage" investigative
study, [the Center for Public Integrity created a database that tracks a
subset of those financial flows:]{.underline} taxpayer-funded programs
or assistance that contribute to a nation's offensive military
capabilities. [The database does not include]{.underline} certain large
nuclear non-proliferation programs or expenditures such as [Foreign
Military Sales or Direct Commercial Sales, which are not supported
directly with taxpayer dollars.]{.underline} The database is also
limited to tracking funds appropriated to either the Defense Department
or the State Department. For this report, these are the criteria for
"foreign military assistance" or "foreign military aid." Funds
appropriated to the State Department and Defense Department represent
the vast majority of unclassified military aid and assistance. This
report does not attempt to track smaller overseas programs where funding
is appropriated to the Justice Department, Drug Enforcement Agency, or
Department of Homeland Security. [The public does not have any way of
tracking classified programs]{.underline} administered by the U.S.
intelligence community. [These]{.underline} classified
[programs]{.underline} **[likely command large amounts of
funding]{.underline}**, especially after the 9/11 attacks, [and
oversight is limited to]{.underline} members of congressional
intelligence [committees]{.underline}. [Programs included]{.underline}
in the Center's database: Coalition Support Funds ([CSF]{.underline}):
created after 9/11 to reimburse key allied countries for providing
assistance to the U.S. in the global war on terror. Regional Defense
Counterterrorism Fellowship Program ([CTFP]{.underline}): created after
9/11 to give the Defense Department its own funding to train and educate
foreign military officers in counterterrorism techniques. In practice,
CTFP has evolved into a program very similar to IMET (see definition
below). [Department of Defense Counterdrug Funding]{.underline}: assists
foreign militaries and security forces to combat drug trafficking around
the world; also known as Section 1004 appropriations. Economic Support
Fund ([ESF]{.underline}): provides grants to foreign governments to
support economic stability. ESF is often used for non-military purposes,
but the grants are commonly viewed as a way to help offset military
expenditures. They have historically been earmarked for key security
allies of the United States. Israel and Egypt are the two largest
recipients of ESF. Foreign Military Financing ([FMF]{.underline}):
finances foreign governments' acquisition of U.S. military articles,
services and training. International Military Education and Training
([IMET]{.underline}): educates foreign military personnel on issues
ranging from democracy and human rights to technical military techniques
and training on U.S. weapons systems. International Narcotics and Law
Enforcement/Andean Counterdrug Initiative ([ACI]{.underline}): the
primary State Department funding effort for countering drugs, including
the large Colombian initiatives. Military Assistance Program
([MAP]{.underline}): provides military material and services to foreign
countries; the U.S. government is not reimbursed. MAP includes
"emergency drawdowns," which are emergency transfers authorized by the
president for weapons, ammunition, parts and military equipment to
foreign governments. Nonproliferation, Anti-Terrorism, De-mining and
Related Activities ([NADR]{.underline}): supports de-mining,
anti-terrorism, and nonproliferation training and assistance.
Peacekeeping Operations ([PKO]{.underline}): supports programs that
improve foreign militaries' peacekeeping capabilities.

### Neoliberalism Makes Aff Inevitable

#### Neoliberalism makes the impact inevitable -- we will export death to sustain the economy -- ending one sale of arms won't change the system

Joe **Brunoli 18**. Progressive Army Contributor. Dual Citizen of the US
and Italy. \@EuroYankeeBlog. This is Neoliberalism, Part IV: The
Military Industrial Complex and the Big Lie Exposed.
<http://progressivearmy.com/2018/05/21/neoliberalism-part-iv-military-industrial-complex-big-lie-exposed/>.

The Business of America ... In Part One of this series, I laid out the
Ten Tenets of Neoliberalism, which declare that [the Market is the
Mother of All things]{.underline}. However, [the arms manufacturing
industry and its main customers in the defense, intelligence and
security industries seem to be the one area of the]{.underline} US
[economy for]{.underline} [which]{.underline} these [laws do not
apply]{.underline}. [Indeed, neoliberalism is defined]{.underline} [not
just by its slavish devotion]{.underline} [to the]{.underline} dictates
of the [Market]{.underline}, [but also by]{.underline} areas, sector,
and **[industries that it singles out for exemption]{.underline}** from
those Market forces. The most indestructible weapons system known to man
is one that is manufactured in all 50 States. [The Defense industry
is]{.underline} one that is [virtually devoid of
competition]{.underline}. Defense contractors charge whatever they can
get away with, and their pricing and profits are rarely if ever
questioned. Yes, we have heard about the famous \$600 hammer and the
\$1000 toilet seat, but those are merely anecdotal punchlines to a cruel
joke. The fact is that Defense contractors have little to no oversight,
and despite the scathing and damning reports issued by the various
Inspectors General for the armed services receive no attention and are
rarely acted upon. A US Army private who drives a truck makes a mere
fraction of what a truck driver working for a Defense contractor makes.
This article in the Washington Examiner describes the various ways in
which Defense contractors make three times private sector wages: ...
defense contractors earn three times as much as their private sector
counterparts, according to a 2012 report by the nonprofit Project on
Government Oversight. Raytheon charges the government \$90 per hour for
"administrative support/clerical" work for individuals with a minimum of
a high school diploma and two years of experience, and slightly more
than \$100 per hour for first-tier management consulting. Rates for
labor are offered as a price to the government, with no information
available as to how much is used for overhead, profit or actually
distributed to workers in the form of pay. Moreover, the government does
not collect data on the number of contractors it hires. Spending on
federal contracts has increased 45 percent in the past decade, which may
help explain why we are now spending 40% more on Defense overall than we
were in 2004--2005 -at the height of the Iran and Iraq Wars. So where
are those Market forces? [The short answer is that Market forces play no
role under neoliberal regimes when it comes to military
spending]{.underline} or spending on other areas that are of personal or
class-based importance to the ruling oligarchy. [This is
why]{.underline}, as I explained in Part Three of this series, [military
service has become the last resort for so many of American
youth]{.underline}. In the absence of access to affordable education or
decent-paying jobs in the private sector, our young people are forced to
risk their lives --- and possibly take the lives of others --- in order
to get by. [Uncle Sam is always hiring]{.underline}, and can always
afford to hire. The Big Secret of Neoliberalism: Deficits don't matter
"Reagan proved that deficits don't matter," Vice President Dick Cheney
said when the Bush administration sought a second round of tax cuts in
2003. Yes, the great neoliberal icon, Ronald Reagan, who claimed we
could simply not afford social programs, who claimed the government was
too big and spent too much, didn't mind going into the red when it came
to stoking up the arms race or handing big tax cuts to his wealthy
donors and friends. And many of them were in the "arms industry". In the
2018 US Budget, defense and military spending were increased by \$80
Billion a year. No debate. No discussion. No filibustering. 60% of
Democrats joined with Republicans to approve this massive increase in
military spending, which, quantitatively speaking, was much more than
the cost of providing tuition-free college to every American student.
But no one asked, "how are you going to pay for that?" [Trade Agreements
are Now Arms Agreements --- and Vice Versa]{.underline} Many on the Left
wondered why Obama and the Democrats were so fervently pushing the TPP.
While some realized that Obama's "pivot to Asia" was not just on
defense, but also on trade, fewer still realized that defense and trade
were now one and the same interest. The TPP will usher in a new era of
massive arms sales to Pacific countries. In 2016, in preparation for
what they believed would be a passing of the TPP, the Obama
Administration lifted a long-standing ban on arms sales to Communist
Vietnam. Why? Because we do not want them to be buying their drones from
China. Likewise, [the enormous arms deals]{.underline} that [we have
signed]{.underline} with Saudi Arabia and Israel [are not]{.underline}
[just for strategic purposes. Our support for the war in Yemen is not
ideologically based --- it is economically based]{.underline}. The US is
one of the sole producers of such weapons as cluster munitions, white
phosphorous and depleted uranium tipped shells --- all of which are
either banned or have been condemned by the international community. It
is getting harder and harder to find buyers for these goods. The Saudis
and Israelis are happy to provide a market for them. Recently, CNN's
Wolf Blitzer spilled the beans about what our relationship with these
countries means. In a contentious interview with Senator Rand Paul,
Blitzer challenged the Senator's opposition to the US aiding Saudi
Arabia in its war in Yemen, claiming that stopping the Saudi support for
the Yemeni genocide would result in lost jobs here at home: "So for you
this is a moral issue," he told Paul during the Kentucky Republican's
appearance on CNN. "Because you know, there's a lot of jobs at stake.
Certainly if a lot of these defense contractors stop selling war planes,
other sophisticated equipment to Saudi Arabia, there's going to be a
significant loss of jobs, of revenue here in the United States. That's
secondary from your standpoint?" The Death Economy The above clip from
CNN really says [everything that needs to be said about the imperial
manifestation of US neoliberal economic policies. We cannot stop making
war because **our economy runs on death**]{.underline}. [The tentacles
of the Military Industrial Complex are sunk deep into every
Congressional District, and the manufacture and sale of weapons have now
become the dominant US industry]{.underline} in terms of providing "good
manufacturing jobs." [All other such jobs have been outsourced and
off-shored]{.underline} under a succession of neoliberal trade
agreements. [The US Military Industrial Complex has been given
immunity]{.underline} from the neoliberal "Market forces" that have
ravaged all other sectors of the American manufacturing base. This was
done on a bipartisan basis over decades. And now [we must accept the
fact that the US economy literally runs on spreading death and misery
around the world]{.underline}. [The solution? Reject
neoliberalism]{.underline}.

### AT: Neoliberalism is Vacuous 

#### 

#### Neoliberalism isn't vacuous -- it's just describing a complicated system of letting the market drive decisions

Jeremy **Fox 16**. Journalist and Consultant, Taught at the Centre for
Teaching and Research Economics (CIDE) in Mexico City. "NEOLIBERALISM"
IS IT?

Samuel Beckett once remarked that he switched to writing in French
rather than English because he considered it impossible to express
anything in English that was not ambiguous. Linguistic reform under the
auspices of the Académie Française in 17th century France resulted in a
literary language stripped of foreign borrowings and regional
accretions, and about which a century later Rivarol famously claimed
that "If it isn't clear, it isn't French".\[1\] English, by contrast,
has always been accumulative, happily borrowing from everywhere,
unruffled by neologisms, grammatical innovations and ambivalence. It
thus came as a surprise to read in William Davies recent piece that [the
term neoliberalism has been savagely dismissed as 'vacuous'
and]{.underline} that so 'distinguished' a pressure group as Progress as
well as various other soothsayers have described it as [a mindless
insult employed by intellectually lazy people who have no sense of what
it might mean]{.underline}. [In rejecting these complaints, Davies tells
us that 'neoliberalism' is both complex and ambiguous]{.underline}
[because]{.underline}, [like other watchwords of political discourse, it
is an abstraction capable of multiple interpretations]{.underline} and
shades of meaning, just like capitalism, communism, democracy, and
liberty. What [concepts like these have]{.underline} [in common is that
they resist one-line interpretation]{.underline}; [and the more we try
to pin them down, the more complex and contentious they seem to
become]{.underline}. [Inability to elucidate a notion]{.underline},
however, [is not the same as lacking a general grasp of its
sense]{.underline}. [Called upon to define our daily use of words of
more than one syllable, many of us would probably flunk the
test]{.underline}. However, [that doesn't make what we say
unintelligible]{.underline}. Compared with some other candidates,
'[neoliberalism' does not seem to be an especially elusive
abstraction]{.underline}. I take it to mean marketisation of the public
realm as a political project. Its current popularity among political
leaders of a certain hue is that it has the appearance of offering
value-free decision-making because it allows market competition rather
than ideological bias to determine value. They are thereby absolved, at
least in theory, from responsibility for the provision of important
public services. In their place, the private sector runs the services on
a competitive basis, or alternatively individuals and self-organised
collectives take charge of their own needs. A recent example of the
latter is the flood defence initiative in the North Yorkshire town of
Pickering. [A core principle of neoliberalism is that citizens are to be
defined first and foremost as consumers]{.underline}. [Hence why
'neoliberal' governments insist on 'consumer choice']{.underline} in
sectors like health and education, a proposition that derives its force
from a now widely discredited but still vital element of classical
economic theory which posits that consumers act rationally in their own
interests. "Rational" is another word capable of multiple
interpretations, but for economists it means optimising the benefit or
utility of a transaction; and it is supposed to be what we do, even
though three hundred and fifty years ago Pascal had already worked out
that we don't -- not always at any rate.\[2\] Here, therefore, we must
wave goodbye to Freud, Jung and the subconscious.

Studies and Head of Peace Studies & International Development, The
University of Bradford. \"Putting disarmament back in the frame.\"
Review of International Studies 32.2 (2006): 353-376.

This categorisation of disarmament highlights part of the problem with
the way in which arms control theory frames both arms control and
disarmament. First, [in framing disarmament as failed and Utopian it
downplays the progress made in realising the disarmament agenda of the
1950s and 60s that structural disarmament combined with a series of
partial disarmament treaties]{.underline} has [brought]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} [thus the extent to which even Utopia might be
realistic]{.underline} for future generations. Second, [in enveloping a
succession of really existing disarmament initiatives within the
essentially realist/neorealist framework]{.underline} of the arms
control perspective [it undermines the claim of disarmament as a
practice and set of goals with real-world relevance]{.underline}. In
combination [this amounts to a very powerful discursive strategy that
works to maintain the intellectual hegemony of arms control]{.underline}
theory in particular and realist academia [and policymaking more
generally]{.underline}. To invert Ken Booth, what is at work here is
what might be termed realist utopianism33 - [the capture and suborning
of Utopian achievements in ways that work to shore up the]{.underline}
realist view of a [world long on dangers and short on peaceful
strategies]{.underline} to confront them. In contrast, [when the various
types of disarmament]{.underline} (some of which have a decidedly
non-utopian flavour to them) [are reclaimed]{.underline} under the
disarmament rubric, [then it becomes clear that the world
has]{.underline}, [and is, experiencing a tremendous amount of
disarmament - some of it relatively successful]{.underline}. This also
has profound implications for the supposed distinction between arms
control and disarmament around which arms control theory is based. Once
we move from framing (successful) partial disarmament as merely one
variant of arms control, and instead frame both GCD and partial
disarmament as variants of disarmament practice; once we understand
disarmament as an activity that is advocated by both Utopians and
hyper-realists alike (albeit in different ways) then both the empirical
and philosophical distinctions between arms control and disarmament fall
away. As will be noted below, this implies that [we need to develop an
alternative way of conceptualising the different strategies]{.underline}

system.

#### Controlling Arms Sales doesn't change the security apparatus -- it operates within the same system

War: Arms Control from Sovereignty to Governmentality. Contemporary
Security Policy, Vol.32, No.1 (April 2011), pp.20--39 ISSN 1352-3260
print

What were some of the conceptual parameters of the 20th century arms
control paradigm, and how did they fit with or break from the previous
historical experience? [The Cold War paradigm was]{.underline},
according to its earliest architects and thinkers, [built around three
main goals]{.underline}.17 [The first, and]{.underline} most obvious,
[was]{.underline} that arms control was a means of
[managing]{.underline} the superpower [nuclear
confrontation]{.underline}. Arms control\'s primary goal was to reduce
the risk of war -- in this case of accidental nuclear war -- and perhaps
incidentally to reduce the costs associated with vertical nuclear
proliferation. Early formal agreements such as the Hot Line Agreement
(20 June 1963), the Outer Space Treaty (10 October 1967), or the Seabed
Treaty (18 May 1972) were explicitly designed to achieve either risk
reduction or reduce the potential costs associated with extended arms
racing to all realms. There were two other stated goals, however, on
which the Cold War practice of arms control had little or no impact:
reducing the destructiveness of war should it break out; and reducing
the cost of preparations for the wars that weren\'t supposed to happen.
The continued pace of technological improvements in nuclear and
conventional weapons, as well as other weapons of mass destruction,
certain offered no reassurance that the destructiveness of modern
warfare had been systematically reduced, although it is certainly the
case that one consistent thread has been the attempt to develop ever
more accurate and targeted weapons systems in order to make the use of
force more precise. Debates over civilian casualties in the wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan, however, point to the difficulties of constraining the
destructiveness of modern war. And -- [as]{.underline} John [Mueller
pointed out]{.underline} [recently]{.underline} -- the more than US\$5.5
trillion spent on the American nuclear arsenal since 1940 (not to
mention other nuclear states), and the more than one trillion dollars in
annual global military expenditures, suggests that [arms control by
itself did little to curtail military spending on weapons
systems]{.underline}.18 **[What restraint that has been exercised has
mostly been driven by economic and budgetary]{.underline}**, [rather
than strategic, considerations related to arms control. So what remains
is]{.underline} a set of formal [arms control]{.underline} agreements,
[mostly bilateral]{.underline}, but also a few that were multilateral,
designed to manage the potentially most dangerous and destabilizing
aspects of inter-state conflict dynamics. [They channeled the
confrontation between the superpowers into a technical and
problem-solving logic that would facilitate decision making about what
kinds of weapons to produce and deploy, and under what circumstances to
use them.]{.underline} In addition, after some of the conceptual
confusions of early nuclear strategy (such as Massive Retaliation), arms
control became part of the logic by which decisions over appropriate
(rational) strategies could be designed. In the 1960s and 1970s, in
context of the East-West conflict and nuclear proliferation, maintaining
the conditions of stable deterrence and reducing the risk of war was
perhaps a politically and normatively laudable goal. But **[arms control
was]{.underline}** thus also **[linked]{.underline}** to deterrence
theory and practice, and **[to the entire functioning of the so-called
military-industrial complex, and not something distinct and in
opposition to it.]{.underline}** This vision would not necessarily be
accepted by those -- such as researchers at the Stockholm International
Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) and other think-tanks -- who saw
themselves as growing out of the peace and anti-nuclear weapons
movements, but I think [the policy acceptability]{.underline} of
SIPRI\'s work (for example) **[came precisely from its progressive
acceptance of the underlying rules of the game.19]{.underline}** What
were these rules of the game? There are four elements of the Cold War
practice of arms control that warrant a deeper exploration in order to
illustrate the normalizing and sovereign logic of arms control. The
first element was the attempt by [proponents of arms
control]{.underline} to [distinguish it from]{.underline} [advocacy of
disarm]{.underline}ament [in any form]{.underline}. Disarmament was
associated with the failed attempts to negotiate reductions in armaments
during the interwar period. In the 1950s and 1960s, it was associated
with the peace and anti-nuclear movements, and was seen as the preserve
of impractical idealist efforts -- at best politically naïve; at worst
politically suspect. As Jeffrey Larsen notes, 'in the early 1960s
international security specialists began using the term arms control in
place of the term disarmament, which they believed lacked precision and
smacked of utopianism. The seminal books on arms control published in
that era all referred to this semantic problem'.20 So [arms control was
presented]{.underline} by its practitioners [as]{.underline} directed
towards [controlling or regulating the numbers, types, deployment or use
of certain types or quantities of arms, and disarmament was defined as
involving the]{.underline} reduction or the [elimination]{.underline} of
particular weapons and weapons systems, and/or foreswearing of
acquisition of new weapons.21 Although occasionally agreements were
signed that did eliminate weapons systems or particular classes of
weapons, most notably the 1987 Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty
that eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons, when seen as part of
the broader spectrum of nuclear capabilities, such restrictions were
tilted more towards the control side of the equation.22
[Overall]{.underline}, [arms control reinforced]{.underline}, not
undermined, [sovereign state power.]{.underline} The second, related,
element was [the technocratic or problem-solving orientation of arms
control practices**. Its political acceptability came from its claim to
operate within the same policy frame as other forms of
military-strategic thinking**]{.underline}, [including of course
deterrence theory and strategy]{.underline}, [alliance-building, and the
entire military-industrial logic]{.underline} that shaped Western (and
arguably Eastern) security policy. More importantly, however, it
provided legitimacy to a counter-intuitive set of policy prescriptions
(such as leaving your own civilian population vulnerable to nuclear
attack, or revealing the equivalent of state secrets as part of
confidence-building measures). And finally, the technocratic approach
also was, in its strongest version, opposed to the irrational and
uncontrollable prescriptions of what, as early as President Eisenhower,
was called the military-industrial complex. [High level proponents of
arms control]{.underline} (Secretary of Defense Robert [McNamara, for
example]{.underline}, as well perhaps as Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger), [regarded the defence establishment as unable to set limits
on its threat assessment]{.underline} and concomitant arms acquisitions.
[They wished to subject security policy to rational managerial
techniques,]{.underline} including such ideas as diminishing marginal
returns to investments in new weapons, cost-benefit analysis for weapons
systems, and trade offs between competing goals (the guns-versus-butter
debate).23 As Henry Kissinger is once purported to have said, 'What in
the name of God is strategic superiority? What is the significance of
it, politically, militarily, operationally, at these levels of numbers?
What do you do with it?' thus expressing his frustration with the
inability of the nuclear defense establishment to provide a rationale
for its weapons acquisition plans.24 Even more hawkish arms controllers
subscribed to the rational calculus, with, for example, Paul Nitze
arguing, with respect to ballistic missile defense (Star Wars), that it
had to be cost effective on the margin in order to make strategic
sense.25 [Arms control was thus]{.underline} more rational -- and
[promised to achieve the same national security goals]{.underline}
(including war-fighting dominance) [at lower cost]{.underline}. But the
actual achievements of arms control negotiations, treaties and
agreements are difficult to assess, even if we use some counter-factual
analysis. As noted above, arms control failed to stem the technological
arms race, failed to reduce spending on weapons, and perhaps played only
a marginal role in preventing a violent superpower confrontation. **[In
all of its forms, arms control was not a transformative paradigm -- but
a techno-managerial project]{.underline}**. The transformation of
inter-state relations via either nuclear disarmament or nuclear
holocaust was to be avoided at all costs, and the management of the
superpower arms race was a sort of via media between these two Manichean
visions. Parenthetically, some prominent advocates, such as Robert
McNamara, or President Barack Obama, who have argued prominently for the
complete abolition of nuclear weapons, claim implicitly or explicitly
that there is a seamless conceptual thread that goes from arms control
to nuclear disarmament, and that all that distinguishes one from the
other is the relative time horizon or degree of pragmatism of the
advocates.26 But this is both conceptually and practically unlikely [--
if arms control is a set of techno-managerial practices fully integrated
into the Cold War logic of national security strategy]{.underline},
[then it is unable to make the leap to disarm]{.underline}ament --
[which involves an entirely different idea about the place of violence
in social and political life.]{.underline} Recent debates around the
ratification of the New START treaty in late 2010 illustrated how it
hardly represented a step towards deeper nuclear reductions.

[As with]{.underline} gasoline, [Coca-Cola, and heroin]{.underline},
[global demand for]{.underline} major conventional [weapons is both
massive and hard to counteract.]{.underline} Moreover, one cannot
understand any of these markets without acknowledging the crucial role
played by the United States. This essay employs both of these insights
to analyze the global production and sale of the principal tools of war,
including fighter aircraft, armored vehicles, naval vessels, and the
munitions they deliver.1 In doing so, it argues that a power such as the
United States---indeed perhaps only the United States---can develop an
effective, if self-serving, international order for moderating arms
transfers in a world of ongoing international competition, weak norms,
fuzzy laws, and shallow institutions. To paraphrase Harold Lasswell's
famous definition of politics, [international relations is largely a
matter of who gets what weapons, when, and how]{.underline}. [Exporting
weapons remains the practice of many states and the ambition of many
more]{.underline}. [The pressures of international politics not only
push states to defend themselves but also encourage economic nationalism
and pride]{.underline}---the three primary justifications for a domestic
arms industry and the exports to support it. On top of this, many
countries believe, often incorrectly, that large economic and political
gains result from selling weapons abroad. For these states, a healthy
arms export business serves as both a signal of international power and
a means of exercising it. [Proliferation of major conventional
weapons]{.underline} (MCW) in larger numbers, at greater levels of
sophistication, and [to more actors is at best a waste of valuable
resources and at worst fuel for more and bloodier
conflicts]{.underline}.2 [Imported weapons are used to repress local
populations]{.underline} [as well as to fight international
wars]{.underline}.3 Beyond that[, as much as 40 percent of the world's
corruption has been associated with the arms trade]{.underline}.4 Given
this track record of violence, repression, and graft, norms against
exporting weapons to active conflicts and human rights abusers, as well
as norms in favor of transparency in weapons transfers, have grown more
salient in recent years. The 2014 UN Conventional Arms Trade Treaty
(CATT), for example, may appear to be a positive step in encouraging, if
not enforcing, such behavior, but compliance with CATT and other, less
formally expressed norms has been limited. As of mid-2017, ninety-two
states have ratified or acceded to the CATT, but four of the most
important market-makers in the global arms trade---Russia, China, India,
and Saudi Arabia---have not signed the treaty. Indeed, observers
actually complain of a recent decline in defense transparency through
much of the world.5 The limited effect of multilateral cooperation in a
world of increasing arms transfers prompts this essay to suggest a
counterintuitive means of limiting the spread of such conventional
weapons. [If one accepts that demand for weapons will remain high, that
many countries aspire to provide them, and that reducing global arms
sales is normatively desirable]{.underline}, [then an uncompetitive
market---where]{.underline} prices are higher, orders are lower, and
**[less technology is transferred---will shape arms transfers in a
positive way]{.underline}**. Given the inelastic nature of this demand,
a monopoly or, better yet, a cartel provides the most feasible means of
moderating supply. [Only one country has the capacity to create such a
market.]{.underline} The first two sections of the essay describe the
United States' distinctive position as a MCW supplier, both in terms of
its market share and in terms of its unique portfolio of buyers.
Sections three and four detail how the United States is already using
its position to curb MCW exports to problematic regimes. The final two
sections argue that although U.S. market dominance may be slightly
eroding and its policy of "unilateral restraint" may be fading, [the
United States can]{.underline} still leverage its market power to create
and lead an informal cartel of MCW exporters. **[Although such an
arrangement may be motivated by pure selfinterest]{.underline}**, **[it
will go a long way toward slowing MCW proliferation.]{.underline}**

A second consequence, usually ignored by those who hold to the
traditional wisdom, is that [for]{.underline} some [issues]{.underline},
especially those [that are]{.underline} most [salient, public opinion
may act as an immediate and **direct constraint** on political
officials]{.underline} in the policymaking process. [[No matter
how]{.mark} inattentive, [uninformed]{.mark}, and erratic [public
opinion is]{.mark}, the public vote political leaders in and out of
office, so elected [officials are]{.mark}]{.underline} particularly
[[sensitive]{.mark} to public opinion]{.underline}. Within the White
House, it is not uncommon to hear people say that "compared with
analysts, presidents and potential presidents themselves see a close
link between stands in foreign policy and the outcomes of presidential
elections" (Halperin 1974:67). Even a casual review of the past two
decades reveals extensive efforts by each administration to shape and
cultivate public opinion and support (see Heilemann and Halperin 2010 on
the 2008 presidential election). Furthermore, [if public feeling becomes
intense concerning an issue, it severely constrains the choices
available]{.underline} within the policymaking process. As Henry
Kissinger (1957:328) once observed, "The acid test of a policy...is its
ability to obtain domestic support." Once the public was educated and
let on the issue of anticommunism, American leaders began to feel
constrained by public opinion, as cold war lessons---for instance that
the United States should take a hardline approach and never appease
aggressors---were internalized by Americans. The last remnant of this
anticommunist legacy in the present era can still be seen in U.S.
foreign policy toward North Korea and Cuba. In addition, [public
[support]{.mark} for a policy [may **turn rapidly** into]{.mark} public
[disapproval]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Although the public tends to [rally
around the flag]{.mark}]{.underline} and the president [during a
crisis]{.underline} such as war, public [[support]{.underline}]{.mark}
for presidential policies [[tends to **dwindle over
time**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Studies]{.underline}, such as John
Mueller's (1973) classic, War, Presidents, and Public Opinion,
[demonstrate that [the longer a war lasts]{.mark}]{.underline} (and the
greater the casualties), [[the more]{.mark} public [support will
**erode**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Quick and successful operations, as in
Grenada, Panama, the Persian Gulf, and Kosovo maximize support; lengthy
and unsuccessful conflicts, as in Korea, Vietnam, Lebanon, and Iraq
bring public disapproval (see Gelpi, Feaver, and Reiffler 2005/06).
George W. [Bush learned how quickly public approval can pivot as support
changed to opposition]{.underline} as time, cost and casualties mounted
in Iraq after 2003, and Barack Obama watched public support evaporate
for his initial economic policies as well as military action in
Afghanistan. Bruce Jentleson (1992:72) found that public opinion "varies
according to the 'principal policy objective' for which force is used."
The tendency is for greater public support for the use of force in order
to "contain" and "restrain" an aggressor state---such as in the Persian
Gulf War---as opposed to using force to "initiate" and "impose" internal
political change within another state---such as within Nicaragua,
Somalia, or Haiti. Obviously, many cases are likely to be, or be
perceived as, somewhat mixed. Nevertheless, Jentleson (1992:72)
concludes: The American public is less gun shy that during the Vietnam
trauma period or the 1970s, but more cautious than during the Cold War
consensus of the 1950s and 1960s...[Presidents who contemplate getting
militarily involved in internal]{.underline} \[END OF PAGE 347\]
[political conflicts]{.underline}---of which there may well be even more
in the post-Cold War world than when bipolarity had its constraining
effects---[had better get in and out quickly and

disposed** to oppose the policy]{.underline}. Thus [[the public tends to
**discriminate** over the use of force]{.mark} more than is commonly
thought [and is **"pretty prudent."**]{.mark}]{.underline} [As can be
seen in the war [in Iraq]{.mark}, from overwhelming support in early
2003]{.underline} at the beginning of the invasion, public support
dwindled steadily---with temporary interruptions for such events as the
capture of Saddam Hussein or the Iraqi elections in 2005---[to the point
where over half the public regarded the actions as a mistake by early
2005]{.underline}. Similarly, the public's preference for withdrawal has
also increased steadily as casualties have mounted (Mueller 2005). In
late 2005, for example, [[**polls** showed that]{.mark}, even while
democracy promotion was embraced]{.underline} by most Americans as a
foreign policy goal, **[[a majority]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Americans
[[opposed]{.mark} the use of military [force]{.mark}]{.underline}
(either directly or via threats) [to promote democracy, and believed
that the goal of establishing democracy in Iraq did not warrant going to
war]{.underline}. Finally, [the **collapse** of the **cold war
consensus**]{.underline} has [made public opinion]{.underline} somewhat
[less responsive to the president]{.underline}. During the 1950s, most
American leaders and members of the elite public shared a similar cold
war view of the world that the mass public tended to follow.
[[Since]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Vietnam]{.underline}]{.mark} War,
however, [**[differing views]{.mark}** of]{.underline} the world and
U.S. [foreign policy [have arisen]{.mark}, leading to greater diversity
and volatility in]{.underline} public [opinion]{.underline}.
[[This]{.mark} has [made it]{.mark}]{.underline} more
[**[difficult]{.mark}** for the president [to **rally** and
**maintain**]{.mark} public [support]{.mark}]{.underline} for particular
polices in an environment where opinion leaders with different foreign
policy views now compete with each other for public support.

### AT: Security Causes War

#### The negative's wholesale rejection of securitization fails -- adopting a framework of issue-specific consequentialist evaluation of securitization can solve the neg's impacts while still solving the case

**[Floyd 07]{.underline}** (Rita Floyd, University of Warwick, Review of
International Studies, Vol 33 p 327-250)

Towards a consequentialist evaluation of security Considering the two
brief overviews of the different schools provided in the first section,
it could be argued that Wæver has an overly negative conception of
security, whereas Booth and Wyn Jones have an overly positive conception
of security. This article will aim to show that [what form security
takes is entirely issue-dependent, leaving both camps having something
important and valid to contribute to the study of security as both camps
can potentially be right. Issue-dependent]{.underline} hereby [does not
mean that,]{.underline} for example, [all securitisations in one
particular sector are always positive]{.underline} (negative) -- indeed
this article will show how differently securitisations in the
environmental sector can turn out -- [it]{.underline} rather [means that
every incidence of securitisation is unique.]{.underline} Since this is
the case, however, s[ecurity in general is neither as good nor as bad as
the two camps argue, but rather it is a mixed bag]{.underline}. In the
approach proposed here, [principles that determine whether a
securitisation is positive or negative can only be derived by
considering what would have been the alternative solution]{.underline}.
[Given that]{.underline} for the Copenhagen School, [securitisation is
nothing but 'an extreme version of politicisation',]{.underline}45 [the
question to consider in evaluating the nature of securitisation must be:
did the securitisation in question achieve more, and/or better results
than a mere politicisation of the issue would have done?]{.underline} It
is important to note here, that ['more and better', is not equivalent to
the success of the speech act]{.underline} (successful securitisation
can still be negative), [but rather it refers to whether the
consequences of, and the gains from, the securitisation are preferable
relative to the consequences and gains from a
politicisation.]{.underline} [The idea that the moral
rightness]{.underline} (or wrongness) [of a securitisation depends on
its consequences corresponds to]{.underline} what in moral philosophy is
known as [a consequentialist ethics]{.underline}. Consequentialism46
referring to a set of moral philosophies, which hold 'that the rightness
of an action is to be judged solely by consequences, states of affairs
brought about by the action'.47 Or, put slightly differently 'a
consequentialist theory \[. . .\] is an account of what justifies an
option over alternatives -- the fact that it promotes values.'48 [These
premises capture well what is meant by positive and negative
securitisation in this article, for the adjectives positive and
negative]{.underline} do not [refer to]{.underline} the relative success
of the speech act that is securitisation, but rather to [how well any
given security policy addresses the insecurity in question]{.underline}.
The approach introduced in this article will henceforth be referred to
as a consequentialist evaluation of security. In moral philosophy [the
idea that the moral rightness]{.underline} (or wrongness) [of an action
is attributable to its consequences alone is of course
contentious]{.underline} (see also fn. 46). [The question that arises is
thus, why, in the evaluation of security/ securitisation, focus on
consequences as opposed to, for example, rights as deontologists would
have it]{.underline}, or indeed virtues, as virtue theorists suggest?
Much of the answer to this question already lies in the argument of this
article. Thus it is not only this author's opinion that the key to
security evaluation lies with its consequences, rather [scholars from
both]{.underline} the [schools]{.underline} discussed above, [with their
respective positive and negative views of security, themselves already
focus on what they take to be the consequences of security]{.underline}.
[That is to say these scholars themselves are
consequentialists]{.underline}. However, and as this article aims to
show, [the consequentialism proposed by them is neither very balanced
nor, in the long run, particularly helpful, as in both cases,
consequentialism is constricted by the nature of their respective
theoretical frameworks. Frameworks, whereby one promotes security as
emancipation, therefore generating a necessarily positive view of
security, whilst the other school's framework for analysis is void of
emancipation altogether, therefore partial to a negative view of
security. That security is neither always positive nor negative but
rather issue dependent is the key hypothesis]{.underline} of this
article. [If this hypothesis holds true we are -- as a discipline --
much in need of a more balanced and indeed critical evaluation of
security than proposed by either school]{.underline}, a provision of
which is the purpose of this article. Given what has been said so far
[it should have become clear that the]{.underline} herewith [proposed
consequentialist evaluation of security is also the key to rendering the
above-mentioned 'normative dilemma of speaking and writing security'
less important, as it enables the analyst to critically evaluate his/her
speaking and writing security, rather than his/her simply speaking and
writing security.]{.underline} [This approach thus enables the
previously solely analytical securitisation analyst to step into the
security equation and on behalf of the actors encourage some
securitisations and renounce others, depending on the moral rightness of
the respective securitisation's consequences. It is precisely at this
point where the emancipatory nature]{.underline} of the Welsh School's
security studies [becomes crucially relevant for a consequentialist
evaluation of security, for]{.underline} -- under this approach -- [it
is the **task of the analyst** to fight ignorance]{.underline} (or, put
differently, false consciousness) [on the part of **existing** and/or
potential **securitising actors** and inform]{.underline} (or better
enlighten) [them of the **best possible actions**]{.underline}. But how
does the analyst know what the best possible actions are? Or, put
differently, with what standards in mind are the consequences to be
evaluated? [Is it enough to problematise securitisation by elites for
elites, and make majority consensus the measuring unit behind the
principles for positive/negative securitisation?]{.underline} One should
think not. Although it is useful to assume, that the narrower the
interest group behind the securitisation, the more likely it is to be
negative, this cannot be ascertained as the only general principle.
After all, [majority consensus does not prevent the effective
securitisation of something that is morally/ethically wrong. But how to
determine what is morally/ethically right? In security studies, one way
of doing so, is by entering the evaluation of positive/negative through
the discourses of security prevalent in the different sectors of
security]{.underline}. Here, [by working out the specific security
relations in the competing discourses that make up the individual
sector]{.underline} -- who or what is the referent object of security,
who is the securitising actor and what is the nature of the threat --
[it should be possible to determine the most and the least advantageous
strategies in addressing insecurity; thereby determining which approach
to security]{.underline} (in the individual sector) [is the
best]{.underline} (most positive) [all-round]{.underline} -- morally,
ethically, effective -- [strategy. A consequentialist evaluation of
security thus postulates the maximisation of genuine security as its
overarching value. The invocation of values itself is perfectly
legitimate, particularly considering that 'every moral theory invokes
values such that it can make sense to recommend in consequentialist
fashion that they be promoted or in non-consequentialist fashion that
they be]{.underline} [honoured]{.underline},

#### Their impact assessment is a rigged game -- they pre-determine the outcome of securitization ignoring counter-evidence.

Since the end of the Cold War security studies has changed greatly and
by now nontraditional security issues such as the environment have
become established alongside more traditional military security issues.2
The debate characteristic for the 1990s between the so-called 'wideners'
and the 'traditionalists' of security has been 'won' by the former, with
security both widened and at the same time deepened to include alongside
the state other referent objects of security, for example, the
individual.3 [Non-traditional or alternative approaches to the study of
security]{.underline} -at least in Europe [have become firmly
established alongside more traditional security studies]{.underline},
with the latter now more commonly referred to by the label strategic
studies.4 No longer primarily concerned with the debate of 'widening'
and 'deepening', analysts working with such approaches have had time to
develop their research agendas and with the so-called Copenhagen-,
Welsh- and Paris schools5, as well as with the human security approach
four distinct, if at times overlapping approaches, have emerged.
[Proponents]{.underline} of each of these four different approaches to
security [are concerned with the consequences of
securitisation]{.underline} and desecuritisation [in so far
as]{.underline} in each case [their anticipation of these consequences
forms the basis for their normative position, with the latter informing
their policy-making recommendations.]{.underline} [The constructivist
security analyst is]{.underline} necessarily [concerned with the
consequences of securitisation]{.underline} and desecuritisation,
[because any such analyst realises that she contributes to the
coconstitution of social and political reality simply by virtue of
writing about security. Despite this realisation]{.underline}, however,
and as the remainder of this section shows, each of [the]{.underline}
four [alternative approaches' view of the consequences of]{.underline}
desecuritisation and [securitisation is one-sided, as in each case these
anticipated consequences are already enshrined into the individual
theoretical framework of the respective approach, disallowing conceptual
room for alternative consequences of either]{.underline}. As a result
all [current normative security theory is fundamentally
limited.]{.underline} The here proposed consequentialist evaluation of
security takes this shortcoming of all exiting alternative security
theories as its point of departure.

### AT: Governmentality Bad

#### Governmental control isn't evil

Stan **Luger 17**. \*\*Professor and Chair of political science,
University of Northern Colorado. \*\*Brian Waddell, Associate Professor
of political science, University of Connecticut. *What American
Government Does*. John Hopkins University Press. 362-71.

[THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT has become]{.underline} very
[controversial]{.underline} in the United States.
[[Many]{.underline}]{.mark} Americans [misunderstand what government
does]{.underline} generally [and **[underappreciate]{.mark}** the
specific role that [government]{.mark} plays]{.underline} in
guaranteeing America\'s success as a nation. [The US government has
improved the lives of Americans in numerous ways]{.underline}. [[It
provides income, food, education, housing, and health
care]{.underline}]{.mark} supports for many, not just those in poverty.
[It [ensures cleaner air, water, and food]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It
[supplies]{.mark} the vast [infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline} ([roads,
bridges, sewage systems, etc]{.underline}.) on which economic growth
depends. [The government has stabilized the economic system]{.underline}
through these activities and others, including the government\'s bailout
of the largest banks and other institutions responsible for the 2008
economic meltdown. [Without government action, that economic crisis
would have led the world economy into a total collapse]{.underline}. The
government also engages in activities that trouble many Americans,
including domestic surveillance and repression and the monitoring and
control of behavior considered to be immoral. The government\'s national
security policies have also spun out of democratic control on many
occasions, leading the nation into unwanted and costly wars and
interventions. [What the government does]{.underline}, then, [is a
complex mix of activities that includes many things that Americans
support wholeheartedly, and others that elicit]{.underline} concern and
[criticism]{.underline}. This has been one of our main points in this
book. [[It is distracting]{.mark} and confusing [to **paint with a broad
brush**]{.mark} when speaking of \"the government.\"]{.underline} The
Anti-Government Movement Still, [many **[conservative
commentators]{.mark}**]{.underline} and politicians [[promote
simplistic, anti-government attitudes]{.mark}, seeking to pit American
[citizens]{.mark} against their government-over which they [still have
**many**]{.mark} **types of [democratic checks]{.mark}**- while
remaining silent about growing private, corporate power]{.underline}.
There has been [a long-standing anti-government strain to American
culture]{.underline} that [has been easily manipulated into blaming
government for]{.underline} many of [the ills affecting the nation
today]{.underline}. [Americans actually embrace collectivist responses
to the many problems they have faced over the course of the twentieth
century]{.underline} and be\"\' \[END PAGE 362\] yond, accepting the
often generous government contributions to their own success, while at
the same time believing in a libertarian individualism that assumes
people are solely responsible for their fates, good or bad. [Americans
are]{.underline} thus [vulnerable to simplistic arguments about their
government, and easily distracted from the larger issues]{.underline} of
power this book has raised. Americans should be vigilant about possible
abuses in the exercise of power. [**Differentiating** among the
government\'s many functions allows a clearer focus for]{.underline}
such [concerns]{.underline}, since [**[not all]{.mark}** government
[powers]{.mark}]{.underline} potentially directly [[threaten]{.mark}
citizens]{.underline}. In addition, we have noted that concerns about
the exercise of power should include both government and the business
system, that is, both public and private power. [The [exercise of power
is **necessary** and **unavoidable** in complex
societies]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Power is
exercised]{.underline}]{.mark} in the public sector by government
officials, and [[in the **private sector**]{.mark} by corporate
executives]{.underline}. [[It is]{.mark} simply [not]{.mark} true that
[only government]{.mark} exercises power]{.underline}. Nor is it true
that the \"free\" market constitutes an arena free of power. One
difference between the two forms of power is that [public power is more
visible, acknowledged, and easily criticized]{.underline}, as we can see
in the strong criticisms of governmental power prevalent today. This
difference is understandable, to an extent, since government can more
directly interfere with one\'s freedom. Still, for many, a person\'s
life opportunities, and the greater part of an individual\'s working
life, are controlled by business enterprises that are not directly
accountable to the larger public. [The irony in this [hyperawareness of
governmental power]{.mark} and lesser concern for private corporate
power [is]{.mark} that [a key attribute of]{.mark} public power is
[its]{.mark} potential **[responsiveness and accountability]{.mark}** to
democratic majorities]{.underline}. [The exercise of public,
governmental [power is]{.mark}]{.underline} more [[scrutinized]{.mark},
and it is]{.underline} acceptable and [expected that we criticize
government]{.underline}, therefore [[making it]{.mark} more
**[accountable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Governmental power is also just
as necessary to our nation\'s success as is the economic system. It is
not simply some contingent institutional force that can be done away
with, in a spasm of anti-government rage. Both the government and the
economic system are inexorably connected in such a way that each is
dependent on the other, in necessary and unavoidable ways, for the
other\'s achievements. There is no free market system without the use of
government power. The so-called free market is simply not a freestanding
entity, as many would have it. This book, by detailing what the
government actually does, has been geared to laying the groundwork for a
healthier debate about the role of government in our lives. [Everyone
likes some parts of what government does while disliking other
parts]{.underline}. [But many politicians today have been selling a
fantasy that government represents the main problem]{.underline} that
stands in the way of greater happiness for most Americans, and that
therefore we must reduce the role of \[END PAGE 363\] government to some
bare minimum, or even eradicate it altogether. As Grover Norquist says:
\"I don\'t want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the
size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the
bathtub.\" 1 Such a flippant statement may simply seem to be hyperbole,
but we must remember the amount of influence Norquist has in the
Republican Party today. Jeb Bush was the only 2016 Republican
presidential candidate not to have signed Norquist\'s Taxpayer
Protection Pledge, which obligates the signer to resist and vote against
any and all tax increases. Nearly 1,400 elected officials have signed
the pledge, including essentially the entire Republican congressional
delegation.2 [The antitax message is one of the most powerful trends
in]{.underline} our [current politics]{.underline}. [It blames
government for all our troubles]{.underline} and, as such, seeks to
\"starve the beast\" so government cannot fulfill its functions capably
any longer. Tax cuts are most often directed at the very wealthy, who
thereby gain both more wealth and more political clout. First, this
allows them to invest their savings in the rising amount of government
debt (needed to replace the revenues lost to tax cuts), transforming
these individuals\' tax liabilities (income on which they otherwise
would have to pay taxes) into an investment in government bonds,
securities, and the like that pay them dividends. As Wolfgang Streeck
discerns, \"Not only is state poverty the investors\' wealth; it offers
them a golden outlet to invest their wealth profitably.\" Second, as
major funders of the fiscal instruments that underwrite the
government\'s debt, they become an important constituency of the modern
state. In the eyes of government officials, the wealthy minority
competes with and even shoulders aside popular majorities. As the
government\'s debt accumulates, the creditors\' claims on government
officials often trump those of common citizens, magnifying what scholars
see as the growing tensions between capitalism and democracy. As Streeck
concludes: \"The state as debt state serves to perpetuate \[and deepen\]
patterns of social stratification and the social inequality built into
them. At the same time, it subjects itself and its activity to the
control of creditors in the shape of \'markets.\' \" 3 Reductions in
taxes deepen the amount of government debt and increase the leverage of
the wealthy over any nation\'s politics. Such tax cuts also
straightjacket government, reducing its ability to deliver the expected
goods to popular majorities. Moreover, [hikes in taxes]{.underline} and
fees paid [by the working classes are used to make up for tax reductions
on the wealthy]{.underline}. Therefore, [the more many Americans pay,
the less they seem to get in return, fueling their increasing
distrust]{.underline} and disgruntlement [about the role of
government]{.underline} in their lives. As a result of this process,
anti-government voices have become the loudest and most prevalent ones
in our politics, so much so that it has become difficult for many
Americans to have a rational and coherent understanding of how necessary
and significant the government is to our nation\'s success. This book
\[END PAGE 364\] has been about providing some of the tools,
understanding, and historical knowledge for interested citizens to gain
a clearer sense of what their government actually does, in order to
combat the simplistic thinking that has come to dominate political
debates. The need for such knowledge is manifest, especially at this
point in our nation\'s history, when recent polls have demonstrated that
the public\'s trust in government is at historic lows. These polls,
however, show something very different from a knee-jerk dislike of
government. When asked about specifics, [large majorities of Americans
have positive views about]{.underline} much of [what the government
does]{.underline}, including [ensuring that foods and medicines are
safe, dealing with natural disasters, setting rules for workplace
safety, preventing terrorist attacks, protecting the environment,
ensuring access to health care and education, maintaining
infrastructure, and strengthening the economy]{.underline}. Of the
thirteen major government functions listed in the polls, Americans gave
high marks to ten of them. And even the low marks involved Americans
believing that more should be done with regard to ensuring a basic
income for the elderly and helping people get out of poverty. Concerns
about managing the immigration system received the lowest marks.4 [[Any
government is **multifaceted**]{.mark}, engaging in many diverse and
even contradictory functions]{.underline}. As a result, [[it is
**difficult to generalize**]{.mark} when we speak of what the government
does]{.underline}. It does many things, and, in this book, we have
attempted to come to grips with the most significant functions of the US
government. [[It is]{.mark} essentially [**meaningless** to **pronounce
blanket statements** about \"the government,\"]{.mark} or \"what the
government does.\"]{.underline} [We can only know our own
government]{.underline}, or any government, [through an understanding of
its specific functions]{.underline}. The polls cited above demonstrate
that Americans appreciate many of government\'s distinct functions,
approving much of what the US government does, while retaining a
generalized distrust of \"the government\" writ large. 5

### AT: Representations First

#### Focusing on Representations Fails

Creation of a Reflective Research Program" *International Organization*
46 (1) p. 370-371

Our critique of the approaches mentioned above should not be interpreted
as reflecting a preference for poststructuralist, postpositivist, and
radical interpretive analyses, although we do hope to build a bridge
between structural and interpretive approaches. [Rejecting the view of
international relations as the mere reflections of discourses and
habits-wherein the word is power and the **only power is the
word**]{.underline}-[we]{.underline} nevertheless [have incorporated
into our reflective approach the notion that the manner in which
people]{.underline} and institutions interpret and [represent
phenomena]{.underline} and structures [makes a difference]{.underline}
for the outcomes we can expect in international relations.\" Thus[, we
adopt an ontology that embraces historical, interpretive factors, as
well as structural forces,]{.underline} explaining change in a dynamic
way. [This ontology reflects an epistemology that is based on a strong
element of intersubjectivity]{.underline}. [So long as **even a tenuous
link** is maintained between objects and their representation, we can
**reject an exclusive focus on words and discourse**.]{.underline} By
[defending an epistemological and ontological link between words and the
objects with which they are commonly associated, we believe that
learning may occur through **reflection on empirical events** **rather
than through their representation**]{.underline}. Finally, epistemic
communities should not be mistaken for a new hegemonic actor that is the
source of political and moral direction in society.\" [Epistemic
communities are not in the business of controlling
societies]{.underline}; what they control is international problems.
Their approach is instrumental, and their life is limited to the time
and space defined by the problem and its solutions. [Epistemic
communities are neither philosophers, nor kings, nor philosopher-
kings]{.underline}.

#### Reps don't cause war

Dan **REITER**, Political Science at Emory, **95** \["Exploring the
Powder Keg Myth," *International Security*, v20 No2 Autumn 1995 pp 5-34
JSTOR\]

A criticism of assessing the frequency of preemptive wars by looking
only at wars themselves is that this misses the non-events, that is,
instances in which preemption would be predicted but did not occur.
However, excluding non-events should bias the results in favor of
finding that preemptive war is an important path to war, as the
inclusion of non-events could only make it seem that the event was less
frequent. [Therefore, if preemptive wars seem infrequent within the set
of wars alone, then this would have to be considered strong evidence in
favor of the]{.underline} third, **[most skeptical view of preemptive
war]{.underline}**, because [even when the sample is rigged to make
preemptive wars seem frequent]{.underline} (by including only wars),
[they are still rare events]{.underline}. Below, a few cases in which
preemption did not occur are discussed to illustrate factors that
constrain preemption.

[The rarity of preemptive wars offers preliminary support for
the]{.underline} third, most skeptical [view, that the preemption
scenario does not tell us much about how war breaks out]{.underline}.
[Closer examination]{.underline} of the three cases of preemption, set
forth below, [casts doubt on the validity of]{.underline} the two
preemption [hypotheses]{.underline} discussed earlier: [that hostile
images of the enemy increase the chances of preemption]{.underline}, and
that belief in the dominance of the offense increases the chances of
preemption. In each case there are motives for war aside from fear of an
imminent attack, indicating that [such fears may not be sufficient to
cause war]{.underline}. In addition, in these cases of war
[the]{.underline} two [conditions hypothesized to stimulate
preemption---hostile images of the adversary]{.underline} and belief in
the military advantages of striking first---[are present to a very high
degree]{.underline}. This implies that [these are insubstantial causal
forces]{.underline}, as they are associated with theoutbreak of war only
when they are present to a very high degree. [This reduces even further
the significance of these forces as causes of war.]{.underline} To
illustrate this point, consider an analogy: say there is a hypothesis
that saccharin causes cancer. Discovering that rats who were fed a lot
of saccharin and also received high levels of X-ray exposure, which we
know causes cancer, had a higher risk for cancer does not, however, set
off alarm bells about the risks of saccharin. Though there might be [a
relationship]{.underline} between saccharin consumption and cancer, this
[is not demonstrated by the results of such a test]{.underline}.

### AT: Structural Violence O/W

#### We should treat war differently than structural violence. The tradeoff only goes in the other direction -- we lose what is distinctive about organized violence.

Tarak **BARKAWI**, Associate Professor of Politics at the New School for
Social Research, **12** \["Of Camps and Critiques: A Reply to 'Security,
War, Violence'" *Millennium* 41 (1) p. 129-130\]

[A final totalising move]{.underline} in 'Security, War, Violence' [is
the idea that the study of war should be subsumed under the category of
'violence']{.underline}. [The reasons offered for this are: violence
does not entail a hierarchy in which war is privileged; a focus on
violence encourages us to see war in relational terms]{.underline} and
makes visible other kinds of violence besides that of war; and that the
analysis of violence somehow enables the disentangling of politics from
war and a proper critique of liberal violence.22 [I have no]{.underline}
particular [objection to the study of violence]{.underline}, and I
certainly think there should be more of it in the social sciences.
[However, why and how this **obviates or subsumes** the study of war is
obscure]{.underline} to me. [Is war not historically significant enough
to justify inquiry into it]{.underline}? [War is a more specific
category relative to violence in general, referring to **reciprocal
organised violence** between political entities]{.underline}. [I make no
claims that the study of war should be privileged over that of other
forms of violence. Both the violence of war, and that of, say,
patriarchy, demand scholarly attention]{.underline}, [but they are also
distinct if related topics requiring **different forms of theorisation
and inquiry**]{.underline}. As for relationality, [the category of war
is already **inherently relational**; one does not need the concept of
violence in general to see thi]{.underline}s. [What precisely
distinguishes war from many other kinds of violence, such as genocide or
massacre, is that war is a relational form of violence in which the
**other side shoots back**]{.underline}. [This is ultimately the source
of war's generative social powers, for it is amidst the clash of arms
that the truths which define social and political orders are brought
into question]{.underline}. [A **broader focus** on violence in general
risks losing this **central, distinctive character** of the violence of
war.]{.underline} [Is it really more theoretically or politically
adequate to start referring to the Second World War as an instance of
'violence'?]{.underline} Equally, [while I am all for the analysis
of]{.underline} liberal violence, another broad category which would
include issues of [**'structural violence'**, I also think we have far
from exhausted the subject of]{.underline} liberalism and
[war]{.underline}, an important area of inquiry now dominated by the
mostly self-serving nostrums of the liberal peace debates.

## Impact Turn - Security Good

### 2ac Security Good

#### Strategic planning to prevent crisis escalation avoids future spirals of insecurity -- makes great power escalation unlikely 

PH **Liotta**, Pell Center for IR & Public Policy, **'5** \[*Security
Dialogue* 36.1, "Through the Looking Glass: Creeping Vulnerabilities and
the Reordering of Security," p. 65-6\]

[Although [it seems attractive to focus on]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}exclusionary concepts that insist on
[[desecuritization]{.underline}]{.mark}, privileged referent objects,
and the 'belief' that threats and vulnerabilities are little more than
social constructions (Grayson, 2003), [[all these concepts work in
theory but fail in practice]{.mark}. While it may be true that national
security paradigms can,]{.underline} and likely will, continue to
[dominate issues that involve human security
vulnerabilitie]{.underline}s -- and even in some instances mistakenly
confuse 'vulnerabilities' as 'threats' -- there are distinct linkages
between these security concepts and applications. With regard to
environ- mental security, for example, Myers (1986: 251) recognized
these linkages nearly two decades ago: National [security is not just
about fighting]{.underline} forces and weaponry. It relates to
water-sheds, croplands, forests, genetic resources, climate and other
factors that rarely figure in the minds of military experts and
political leaders, but increasingly deserve, in their collectivity, to
rank alongside military approaches as crucial in a nation's security.
Ultimately, we are far from what O'Hanlon & Singer (2004) term a global
intervention capability on behalf of 'humanitarian transformation'.
Granted, we now have the threat of mass casualty terrorism anytime,
anywhere -- and states and regions are responding differently to this
challenge. Yet, the global community today also faces many of the same
problems of the 1990s: civil wars, faltering states, humanitarian
crises. We are nowhere closer to addressing how best to solve these
challenges, even as they affect issues of environmental, human, national
(and even 'embedded') security. Recently, [there have been a number of
voices that have spoken out on]{.underline} what the International
Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty has termed the
'responsibility to protect':10 the responsibility of some agency or
state (whether it be a superpower such as the United States or an
institution such as the United Nations) to enforce the principle of
security that sovereign states owe to their citizens. Yet, the creation
of a [[sense of urgency to act --]{.mark} even on some issues that may
not have some impact for years or even decades to come-- i[s]{.mark}
perhaps [the only appropriate first response. The real cost of not
investing]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}in the right way and [[early
enough]{.mark} in the places where trends and effects are accelerating
in the wrong direction [is]{.mark} likely to be [decades]{.mark} and
decades [of economic and political frustration -- and]{.mark},
potentially, [military engagement]{.mark}. [Rather than justifying
intervention]{.mark} (especially military), [we ought to be justifying
investment]{.mark}.]{.underline} Simply addressing the immensities of
these challenges is not enough. Radical improvements in public
infrastructure and support for better governance, particularly in states
and municipalities (especially along the Lagos--Cairo--Karachi--Jakarta
arc), will both improve security and create the conditions for shrinking
the gap between expectations and opportunity. A real debate ought to be
taking place today. [[Rather than dismissing 'alternative'
security]{.mark} foci outright, [a larger examination of what forms of
security are relevant ]{.mark}]{.underline}and right among communities,
states, and regions, and which even might apply to a global rule-set --
as well as what types of security are not relevant -- [[seems]{.mark}
appropriate and [necessary. If this occurs, a truly remarkable tectonic
shift might take place in the conduct of international relations and
human affairs.]{.mark}]{.underline} Perhaps, in the failure of states
and the international community to respond to such approaches, what is
needed is the equivalent of the 1972 Stockholm conference that launched
the global environmental movement and estab- lished the United Nations
Environmental Programme (UNEP), designed to be the environmental
conscience of the United Nations. Similarly, the UN Habitat II
Conference in Istanbul in 1996 focused on the themes of finding adequate
shelter for all and sustaining human development in an increas- ingly
urbanized world. Whether or not these programs have the ability to
influence the future's direction (or receive wide international support)
is a matter of some debate. Yet, given that the most powerful states in
the world are not currently focusing on these issues to a degree
sufficient to produce viable implementation plans or development
strategies, there may well need to be a 'groundswell' of bottom-up
pressure, perhaps in the form of a global citizenry petition to push the
elusive world community toward collective action. Recent history
suggests that military intervention as the first line of response to
human security conditions underscores a seriously flawed approach.
Moreover, those who advocate that a state's disconnectedness from
globalization is inversely proportional to the likelihood of military
(read: US) intervention fail to recognize unfolding realities (Barnett,
2003, 2004). Both middle-power and major-power states, as well as the
international com- munity, must increasingly focus on long-term creeping
vulnerabilities in order to avoid crisis responses to conditions of
extreme vulnerability. Admittedly, some human security proponents have
recently soured on the viability of the concept in the face of recent
'either with us or against us' power politics (Suhrke, 2004). At the
same time, and in a bit more positive light, some have clearly
recognized the sheer impossibility of international power politics
continuing to feign indifference in the face of moral categories. As
Burgess (2004: 278) notes, 'for all its evils, one of the promises of
globalization is the unmasking of the intertwined nature of ethics and
politics in the complex landscape of social, economic, political and
environmental security'. While it is still not feasible to establish a
threshold definition for human security that neatly fits all concerns
and arguments (as suggested by Owen, 2004: 383), it would be a tragic
mistake to assume that national, human, and environmental security are
mutually harmonious constructs rather than more often locked in
conflictual and contested opposition with each other. Moreover, aspects
of security resident in each concept are indeed themselves embedded with
extraordinary contradictions. Human security, in particular, is not now,
nor should likely ever be, the mirror image of national security. Yet,
these contradictions are not the crucial recognition here. On the
contrary, [[rather than focusing on the security issues]{.mark}
themselves, [we should be focusing on the best]{.mark} multi-dimensional
[approaches to confronting and solving them.]{.mark} One [approach,
which might avoid the massive]{.mark} tidal [impact of creeping
vulnerabilities]{.mark}, is [to sharply]{.mark} make a rudder [shift
from]{.mark} constant [crisis intervention toward strategic
planning]{.mark}]{.underline}, strategic investment, and strategic
attention. Clearly, the time is now to **reorder our** entire
**approach** to how we address -- or fail to address -- security.

### Ext -- Security Good

#### Security key to avoid fascism---We should manage violence instead of trying to create a metapolitics of difference and peace.

The other main possibility is to stress responsibility. Particularly [in
a field like security one has to make choices and deal with
the]{.underline} challenges and [risks that one confronts]{.underline} -
and not shy away into long-range or principled trans- formations. [[The
meta-political line **risks** (despite the theoretical commitment to the
concrete other]{.underline}) [**implying** that **politics can be
contained within large \'systemic\'
questions**]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} In line with the
classical revolutionary tradition, [after the change]{.underline} (now
no longer the revolution but [the meta-physical transformation), there
will he no more problems whereas in our situation]{.underline} (until
the change) we should not deal with the \'small questions\' of politics,
only with the large one cf. Rorty 1996). However, the ethical demand in
post- structuralism (e.g. Derrida\'s \'justice\') is of a kind that can
never be instantiated in any concrete political order - it is an
experience of the undecidable that exceeds any concrete solution and
re-inserts politics. Therefore, [[politics can never be reduced to
meta-questions; there is no way to erase]{.underline}]{.mark} the small,
particular, banal [[conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark} and controversies. In
contrast to the quasi-institutionalist formula of radical democracy
which one finds in the \'opening\' oriented version of deconstruction,
we could with Derrida stress the singularity of the event. To take a
position, take part, and \'produce events\' (Derrida 1994: 89) means to
get involved in specific struggles. Politics takes place \'in the
singular event of engagement\' (Derrida 1996: R3). In contrast to the
quasi-institutionalist formula of radical democracy which one finds in
the \'opening\' oriented version of deconstruction, we could with
Derrida stress the singularity of the event. To take a position, take
part, and \'produce events\' (Derrida \$994: 89) means to get involved
in specific struggles. Politics takes place \'in the singular event of
engagement\' (Derrida 1996: 3), Derrida\'s politics is focused on the
calls that demand response/responsibility contained in words like
justice, Europe and emancipation. Should we treat security in this
manner? No, security is not that kind of call. [[\'Security\' is not a
way to open]{.mark} (or keep open) [an ethical
horizon]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Security is a]{.underline}]{.mark} much
more [[situational concept]{.underline}]{.mark} oriented to the handling
of specifics. [It belongs [to]{.mark} the sphere of how to handle
challenges - and **[avoid \'the worst\']{.mark}**]{.underline}
[]{.mark}(Derrida 1991). Here enters again the possible pessimism which
for the security analyst might be occupational or structural. The
infinitude of responsibility (Derrida 1996: 86) or the tragic nature of
politics (Morgenthau 1946, Chapter 7) means that one can never feel
reassured that by some \'good deed\', \'1 have assumed my
responsibilities\' (Derrida 1996: 86). [If I conduct myself particularly
well with regard to someone, I know that it is to the detriment of an
other; of one nation]{.underline} to the detriment of another nation, of
one family to the detriment of another family, of my friends to the
detriment of other friends or non-friends, etc. This is the infinitude
that inscribes itself within responsibility; otherwise there would he no
ethical problems or decisions. (ibid.) and parallel argumentation in
Morgenthau 1946; Chapters 6 and 7) Because of this there will remain
conflicts and risks - and the question of how to handle them. [[Should
developments be securitized]{.mark}]{.underline} (and if so, [in what
terms]{.underline})? Often, our reply will he to aim for
de-securitization and then politics meet meta-politics, but
[[occasionally the underlying pessimism regarding the prospects for
orderliness]{.mark} and compatibility among human aspirations [will
point to scenarios sufficiently worrisome that responsibility will
entail securitization in order to block the worst.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[As a security]{.mark}/[securitization analyst, this means accepting
the task of trying to manage and avoid spirals and accelerating security
concerns]{.mark}]{.underline}, to try to assist in shaping the continent
in a way that creates the least insecurity and violence - even if this
occasionally means invoking/producing \'structures\' or even using the
dubious instrument of securitization. In the case of the current
European configuration, the above analysis suggests [the use of
securitizati]{.underline}on at the level of European scenarios [w[ith
the aim of **pre- empting and avoiding numerous instances of local
securitization** that could lead to]{.mark}]{.underline} [[security
dilemmas and **escalations**]{.underline}**,** [violence and mutual
vilification.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Evaluating consequences and planning security good

of International Relations* p.165-167

Moreover, the links between sceptical realism and prevalent post-modern
themes go more deeply than this, particularly as they apply to attempts
by post-structural thinking to reopen questions of responsibility and
ethics. In part, the goals of [[post-structural
approaches]{.underline}]{.mark} can be usefully [characterised]{.mark},
to borrow Stephen White\'s illuminating contrast, [[as]{.mark}
expressions of [\'responsibility to otherness\']{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}which question and challenge modernist equations of
responsibility with a \'responsibility to act\'. A responsibility to
otherness seeks to reveal and open the constitutive processes and claims
of subjects and subjectivities that a foundational modernism has effaced
in its narrow identification of responsibility with a \'responsibility
to act?\' Deconstruction can from this perspective be seen as a
principled stance unwilling to succumb to modernist essentialism which
in the name of responsibility assumes and reifies, subjects and
structures, obscures forms of power and violence which are constitutive
of them, and at the same time forecloses a consideration of alternative
possibilities and practices. Yet it is my claim that [[the wilful
Realist tradition does not lack an understanding of the
contingency]{.mark} of practice [or]{.mark} a vision of [responsibility
to otherness]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the contrary[. [its **strategy of
objectification** is precisely an attempt to bring together a
responsibility to otherness and a responsibility to act]{.mark} within a
wilfully liberal vision. [The construction of a **realm of objectivity
and calculation**]{.mark} [is]{.mark} not just [a consequence of a need
to act]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}- the framing of an epistemic
context for successful calculation. [It is [a form of **responsibility
to otherness**,]{.mark} an attempt [to allow for diversity and
irreconcilability precisely by]{.mark}]{.underline} - at least initially
[- [reducing the self and the other to a structure of material
calculation in order to allow a structure of **mutual intelligibility,
mediation, and stability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is, in short, a
strategy of limitation: [a wilful attempt to construct a subject and a
social world limited]{.underline} - both [epistemically and
politically]{.underline} - [in the name of a politics of
toleration]{.underline}: a liberal strategy that John Gray has recently
characterised as one of modus vivendi. If this is the case, then the
deconstructive move that gains some of its weight by contrasting itself
to a non- or apolitical objectivism must engage with the more complex
contrast to a sceptical Realist tradition that is itself a constructed,
ethical practice. This issue becomes even more acute if one considers
Iver Neumann\'s incisive questions concerning postmodem constructions of
identity, action, and responsibility. 83 Neumann points out, [[the
insight that identities are inescapably contingent and relationally
constructed]{.underline},]{.mark} and even the claim that identities
Inescapably indebted to othemess, [[**do not**]{.underline}]{.mark} in
themselves **[[provide a foundation for practice]{.mark},]{.underline}**
[particularly in situations [where identities are **\'sedimented\' and
conflictually defined**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In these cases,
[[deconstruction alone will not suffice]{.mark} unless it can
demonstrate a capacity to counter in practice]{.underline} (and not just
in philosophic practice) [the essentialist dynamics it
confronts]{.underline})44 Here, [[a responsibility to act must go beyond
deconstruction to consider **viable** **alternatives and
counter-practices**]{.mark}.]{.underline} To take
[[this]{.underline}]{.mark} critique seriously [[is
not]{.underline}]{.mark} necessarily [[to be subject]{.mark} yet again
[to the]{.mark} straightforward [\'blackmail of the
Enlightenment\']{.mark}]{.underline} and a narrow \'modernist\' vision
of responsibility.\" While an unwillingness to move beyond [a
[deconstructive]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}ethic of responsibility to
otherness for [[fear]{.mark} that an essentialist stance is the
only]{.underline} (or most likely) [alternative]{.underline} expresses a
legitimate concern, it [[should not license a retreat
from]{.underline}]{.mark} such questions or their [[practical
demands]{.underline}.]{.mark} Rather[, such situations demand also [an
evaluation of]{.mark} the structures (of identity and
[institutions]{.mark}) that [might ***viably*** be mobilised in order to
**offset the worst implications** of violently exclusionary
identities]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}It requires. as Neumann nicely
puts it, [the generation of compelling \'as if\' stories around which
counter-subjectivities and political practices can
coalesce]{.underline}. [[Wilful Realism]{.underline}]{.mark}, 1 submit,
arises out of an appreciation of these issues, and [[comprises]{.mark}
an attempt to craft precisely [such \'stories\']{.mark} within a broader
intellectual and sociological analysis [of]{.mark} their]{.underline}
conditions of production, **[[possibilities of success, and likely
consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The question is, to what extent are
these limits capable of success-and to what extent might they be limits
upon their own aspirations to responsibility? These are crucial
questions, but they will not be addressed by retreating yet again into
further reversals of the same old dichotomies.

## Alternative

### 2ac -- Alt Fails

#### The alt fails---the system's too sticky to simply wish away

Georg **SORENSEN**, British International Studies Association, **98**
\[*IR Theory after the cold war*, p. 87-88\]

[What,]{.underline} then, [are the]{.underline} more general [problems
with]{.underline} the extreme versions of [the postpositivist
position]{.underline}? The [first]{.underline} problem is that [they
tend to overlook]{.underline}, or downplay, the [actual insights
produced by non-post-positivists]{.underline}, such as, for example,
neorealism. [It is]{.underline} entirely [true that anarchy is no
given]{.underline}, ahistorical, natural condition to which the only
possible reaction is adaptation. [But the fact that anarchy is a
historically specific, socially constructed product of human practice
does not make it less real]{.underline}. [In a world of sovereign
states, anarchy is in fact out there in the real world in some
form]{.underline}. In other words, [it is not]{.underline} the
[acceptance of the real existence of social phenomena which produces
objectivist reification. Reification is produced by the transformation
of historically specific social phenomena into given, ahistorical,
natural conditions]{.underline}.21 [Despite]{.underline} their
[shortcomings]{.underline}, neorealism and other [positivist theories
have produced valuable insights]{.underline} about anarchy, including
the factors in play in balance-of-power dynamics and [in patterns of
cooperation and conflict]{.underline}. [Such insights are]{.underline}
downplayed and even sometimes [dismissed in adopting the notion of
\'regimes of truth\']{.underline}. It is, of course, possible to
appreciate the shortcomings of neorealism while also recognizing that it
has merits. One way of doing so is set forth by Robert
[Cox]{.underline}. He [considers neorealism]{.underline} to be [a
\'problem-solving theory\']{.underline} which \'takes the world as it
finds it, with the prevailing social and power relationships . . . as
the given framework for action . . [. The strength of the
problem-solving]{.underline} approach [lies in its ability to fix limits
or parameters to a problem area and to reduce the statement of a
particular problem to a limited number of variables which are amenable
to relatively close and precise examination\']{.underline}.22 At the
same time, this \'assumption of fixity\' is \'also an ideological bias .
. . Problem-solving theories (serve) . . . particular national,
sectional or class interests, which are comfortable within the given
order\'.23 In sum, [objectivist theory]{.underline} such as neorealism
[contains a bias, but that does not mean that it is without
merit]{.underline} in analysing particular aspects of international
relations from a particular point of view. [The second
problem]{.underline} with post-positivism [is the danger of extreme
relativism]{.underline} which it contains. [If there are no neutral
grounds for deciding about truth]{.underline} claims so that each theory
will define what counts as the facts, [then the door is]{.underline}, at
least in principle, [open to anything goes.]{.underline} Steve Smith has
confronted this problem in an exchange with Øyvind Østerud. Smith notes
that he has never \'met a postmodernist who would accept that \"the
earth is flat if you say so\". Nor has any postmodernist I have read
argued or implied that \"any narrative is as good as any other\"\'.24
But the problem remains that [if we cannot find a minimum of common
standards for]{.underline} deciding about [truth]{.underline} claims [a
post-modernist position appears unable to come up with a
metatheoretically substantiated critique of the claim that the earth is
flat]{.underline}. In the absence of at least some common standards it
appears difficult to reject that any narrative is as good as any
other.25 [The final problem]{.underline} with extreme post-positivism I
wish to address here [concerns change]{.underline}. We noted the
post-modern critique of neorealism\'s difficulties with embracing
change; their emphasis is on \'continuity and repetition\'. But extreme
post-positivists have their own problem with change, which follows from
their metatheoretical position. In short, [how can post-positivist ideas
and projects of change be distinguished from pure utopianism and wishful
thinking?]{.underline} Post-positivist [radical subjectivism leaves no
common ground for choosing between different change
projects]{.underline}. A brief comparison with a classical Marxist idea
of change will demonstrate the point I am trying to make. In Marxism,
social change ( e.g. revolution) is, of course, possible. But that
possibility is tied in with the historically specific social structures
(material and non-material) of the world. [Revolution is possible under
certain social conditions but not under any conditions. Humans can
change the world, but they are enabled and constrained by the social
structures in which they live]{.underline}. [There is a dialectic
between social structure and human behaviour]{.underline}.26 The
understanding of \'change\' in the Marxist tradition is thus closely
related to an appreciation of the historically specific social
conditions under which people live; any change project is not possible
at any time. Robert Cox makes a similar point in writing about critical
theory: [\'Critical theory allows for a normative choice in favor of a
social and political order different from the prevailing order, but it
limits the range of choice to alternative orders which are feasible
transformations of the existing world . . . Critical theory thus
contains an element of utopianism in the sense that it can represent a
coherent picture of an alternative order, but its utopianism is
constrained by its comprehension of historical processes]{.underline}.
It must reject improbable alternatives just as it rejects the permanency
of the existing order\'.27 [That constraint appears to be absent in
post-positivist thinking about change, because radical post-positivism
is epistemologically and ontologically cut off from evaluating the
relative merit of different change projects]{.underline}. Anything goes,
or so it seems. That view is hard to distinguish from utopianism and
wishful thinking. If neorealism denies change in its overemphasis on
continuity and repetition, then radical post-positivism is

A final danger in focusing on the state is that of building the illusion
that states have impenetrable walls, that they have an inside and an
outside, and that nothing ever passes through. Wolfers's billiard balls
have contributed to this misconception. But the state concepts we should
use **are in no need of** such an illusion. Whoever criticizes the field
for such sins in the past needs to **go back to the literature**. Of
course, we must continue to be open to a frank and unbiased assessment
of the transnational politics which significantly in- fluence almost
every issue on the domestic political agenda. The first decade of my own
research was spent studying these phenomena -- and I disavow none of my
conclusions about the state's limitations. Yet I am not ashamed to talk
of a domestic political agenda. Anyone with a little knowledge of Euro-
pean politics knows that Danish politics is not Swedish politics is not
German politics is not British politics. Nor would I hesitate for a
moment to talk of the role of the state in transnational politics, where
it is an important actor, though only one among many other competing
ones. In the world of transnational relations, the exploitation of
states by interest groups -- by their assumption of roles as
representatives of states or by convincing state representatives to
argue their case and defend their narrow interests -- is a significant
class of phenomena, today as much as yesterday. Towards a Renewal of the
Empirical Foundation for Security Studies Fundamentally, the sum of the
foregoing list of sins blamed on the Copen- hagen school amounts to a
lack of attention paid to just that 'reality' of security which Ole
Wæver consciously chose to leave aside a decade ago in order to pursue
the politics of securitization instead. I cannot claim that he is void
of interest in the empirical aspects of security because much of the
1997 book is devoted to empirical concerns. However, the attention to
agenda-setting -- confirmed in his most recent work -- draws attention
away from the important issues we need to work on more closely if we
want to contribute to a better understanding of European **security as
it is** currently developing**.** That inevitably requires a more
**consistent** interest in security policy in the making -- not just in
the development of alternative security policies. The dan- ger here is
that, as alternative policies are likely to fail grandly on the
political arena, crucial decisions may be made in the '**traditional'
sector of security** policymaking, **unheeded by any but the most
uncritical minds.**

"Two Cheers?" When judging the effects of U.S. dominance on major
conventional weapons proliferation, I have been careful to use
qualifiers such as "relative." [The United States, pursuing]{.underline}
what it considers to be [its interests, may impede grander forms of
international cooperation and perpetuate a certain type of warfare that
suits its ends.]{.underline}51 It was certainly no friend to the UN
Conventional Arms Trade Treaty in its early stages of development.52 As
signed, the CATT is a pretty transparent effort to legitimate and spread
existing U.S. practices.53 **[But international politics as currently
practiced does not allow for a more effective means of moderating the
spread of weapons]{.underline}**. [Activists and]{.underline} U.S.
foreign [policymakers should also have realistic]{.underline}
[expectations that many of these steps will only delay]{.underline}
[proliferation]{.underline} and make it more expensive; [they will not
eliminate it altogether]{.underline}. While a cartel of like-minded
allies would cement U.S. influence over major conventional weapons
proliferation, this essay has shown that [the economic and political
power of the U.S. market remains sufficiently high that it can
unilaterally enforce higher ethical standards for vast swathes of the
global arms market]{.underline}. Krause, in discussing the difference
between first- and second-tier arms exporters, argues that market power
is a prerequisite for a state to use arms sales to advance political,
rather than economic, goals.54 But [what if a first-tier state is
interested solely in the latter?]{.underline} Largely in the name of
supporting U.S. manufacturing jobs, but also due to a lack of interest
in promoting liberal norms abroad, the Trump administration has already
overturned several of the previous administration's decisions to hold up
arms sales over human rights concerns for countries such as Bahrain,
Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, and Thailand. [But]{.underline} even if a
monopolist collects its rent in cash instead of political gains, the
supply of arms will be reduced. **[It remains easier to change the
foreign policy position of one large state than shift an entire
market]{.underline}**. Finally, such an administration is unlikely to be
interested in the Arms Trade Treaty either. [There is something ironic,
perhaps even perverse, in labeling the world's largest arms dealer as
the best hope for counter-proliferation]{.underline}. Such a market will
be rife with hypocrisy as large sales continue to go to countries such
as Saudi Arabia, and will give the United States tremendous leverage in
influencing smaller states' foreign (and domestic) policies. But [it
will]{.underline} also [result in a less competitive global arms
market,]{.underline} [which will]{.underline} go a long way in
[slow]{.underline}ing the proliferation of [dangerous
techn]{.underline}ology, [reducing the resources spent in the developing
world on weapons, stymieing the deadweight losses of corruption in the
arms industry, and lowering the rewards for human rights
abusers]{.underline}. **[While far from an ideal arrangement, one cannot

### Ext -- First Step

#### Arms sales fuel militarism and neoliberalism -- ending them is a first step

of Race, Gender and Sexuality Studies @ Mills College & Professor at

The articles in Part I focus on connections among nation-states,
militaries, and corporations. Staples uses the term \"corporate-military
complex,\" rather than President Eisenhower\'s \"military-industrial
complex,\" as more accurate for contemporary times. In an early draft of
his speech on leaving office in 1961, [Eisenhower used the phrase
\"military-industrial-congressional\" complex]{.underline}, but dropped
the reference to Congress in the public version (Nelson, 2000: 6).
Lockheed Martin, the largest weapons maker in the world, provides a
current example of these connections. The company received over \$18
billion in U.S. government contracts in 1999, \$12.6 billion from the
Pentagon and over \$2 billion from the Department of Energy for
nuclear-weapons activities (Fischer, Sredanovic, and Massen, 2000). When
Lockheed merged with Martin Marietta in 1995, U.S. taxpayers paid \$1.2
billion for merger-related costs such as employee relocations and plant
closures. Lockheed Martin has given over \$1.6 million in Political
Action Committee (PAC) contributions since 1997, plus another
\$500,000in soft money to Democratic and Republican Party committees; it
also spent \$10.2 million on lobbying in 1997 and 1998. Key Lockheed
Martin company associates are involved at top levels of the Republican
and Democratic presidential campaigns and in foreign-policy decision
making. Many commen? tators have noted the weakening of the nation-state
as a corollary of increased corporate power. Despite some significant
changes, we argue that [nation-states continue to fulfill their major
function: maintaining conditions for capital accumulation]{.underline}.
Financing the military and, where necessary, generating strong
ideological support for it, whether by invoking patriotism,
ethnocentrism, or national security, is a crucial state role. [The
military is both a state agency and a highly profitable sector within
industrialized economies]{.underline} due to weapons manufacturing and
the international trade in arms. [Governments]{.underline} of countries
[with arms industries]{.underline} [pay for weapons production twice
over]{.underline}. Public funds underwrite the often decades-long
development process for complex weapons systems, and governments are the
sole customers for them. Steven Staples argues that the large U.S.
military budget \"is for all practical purposes a corporate subsidy\"
siphoning public money into private hands, and protected under Article
XXI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which allows
\"governments free reign for actions taken for national security
interests.\" Staples argues that with global economic integration [the
\"weakened state no longer has the ability to reign in weapons
corporations, and is trapped increasingly by corporate
interests]{.underline}: greater military spending, state subsidies,
**[and a liberalization of the arms trade]{.underline}**." Tamar
[Gabelnick and]{.underline} Anna [Rich]{.underline} [take up the issue
of the arms trade]{.underline} in the fifth article. [They emphasize
potential contradictions between security policy and]{.underline}
international [arms sales, noting that \"U.S. arms export
policy]{.underline} was established to protect national security, but
[has become increasingly focused on commercial interests]{.underline}\"
such that \"proposed export reforms will lead to further loss of control
over conventional arms proliferation.\" [An outcome of international
sales is that militaries]{.underline} can [find themselves up against an
enemy armed with weapons provided by their own governments]{.underline}
if political and military alliances shift. This happened to Britain in
the Falklands/Malvinas war and to the United States in the Persian Gulf
War. [In an attempt to reduce arms sales]{.underline}, U.S.
Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney has proposed a Code of Conduct [that
would restrict the sale of arms]{.underline} to countries that are
\"nondemocratic, aggressors, human rights abusers, or not open about
their military spending.\" **[This is a step in the right
direction]{.underline}**, but as Gabelnick and Rich suggest, it will
need to be applied consistently to have much impact. The definitions of
nondemocratic, aggression, or human rights abuse are open to
interpretation. Russia\'s assurance, for example, \"that it will not
sell offensive weapons to Iran despite \[its\] decision.. .to resume
arms sales to Teheran\" (Reuters, December 7, 2000: A16) suggests a
clear-cut distinction between offensive and defensive weapons that may
be meaningless in practice. [Many countries are involved in arms
trading. Most people are killed by small arms]{.underline} that are
cheap and easily available worldwide, rather than by highly
sophisticated weaponry. A good deal of the cross-border trade in [small
arms]{.underline} is illegal, but [highly profitable]{.underline} for
manufacturers, dealers, brokers, shippers, and financiers (Lumpe, 2000).
[This trade is an important way for poorer countries to earn hard
currency to repay foreign debt.]{.underline} Staples notes that
\"foreign embassies and trade missions abroad are used to aid arms
sales,\" a point reiterated by Karen Talbot, who argues that \"bombing
and missile strikes, are, more than ever, giant bazaars for selling the
wares of the armaments manufacturers.\" The Persian Gulf War and the
bombing of Kosovo allowed stocks to be displayed, tested, and reduced
somewhat. William Greider (1998) argues that there is no technical
reason to update U.S. weapons ? the most sophisticated in the world ?
except for the need for continued profits. He notes that the biggest
enemy of future U.S. weapons production is the copious supply of weapons
already in existence; hence, the need to use them so as to justify
continued production.

### Not Mutually Exclusive

#### Reducing violence and combatting structures of militarism aren't exclusive- controlling the means of violence (CMV) does both 

**Cooper and Mutimer, PhDs, 12**

(Neil, IR@Bradford, David, PoliSci@York, *Arms control for the 21^st^
Century: Controlling the Means of Violence* in [Reconceptualising Arms
Control: Controlling the Means of Violence]{.underline}, ed. Cooper &
Mutimer)

It should be noted that even this more expansive control agenda did not
go far enough for some of our conference [participants]{.underline} who
[argued that the limitation of armed violence]{.underline} also
[necessitated a focus on **changing mindsets** and cultures of
violence]{.underline}. [We would not disagree]{.underline} with the idea
that cultures of militarism and violence need to be rejected if
meaningful peace is to be secured (although we do have reservations
regarding the way in which contemporary CMV practice has tended to
become more about problematizing the cultures of violence possessed by
others, rather than critiquing our own militarism). However, [we would
also argue that for CMV as a field to have coherence it also needs to
maintain a concern with the **means by which armed violence is
perpetrated**]{.underline}, including both the instruments (for example,
armed forces, suicide bombers) and technologies (such as fighter planes,
bio-weapons, communications systems, improvised explosive devices
\[IEDs\]) of armed violence against individuals, communities, and even
states. [This includes]{.underline}, for example, [limits on small arms
to prevent inter-communal violence]{.underline}; even restrictions on
knives to prevent knife crime against individuals; [while also
including]{.underline} sustained attention to the most potent means of
the most extreme violence, **[controlling the military capacity of
states]{.underline}**, whether this be via multilateral disarmament
initiatives such as the CWC; arms limitation agreements such as the New
START agreement between the United States and Russia;
confidence-building measures designed to reassure actors that particular
force structures are not threatening; or the harnessing of nano or
biotechnology in as yet undreamed of ways to serve the goals of arms
control (verification, for example) rather than to undermine them.
[We]{.underline} would therefore [make a distinction between the
immediate and direct aims]{.underline} of CMV initiatives on the one
hand [and the longer term, indirect effects]{.underline} of the
strategies of control employed. With regards to the former, we would
argue for the following reformulation of the classic aims of arms
control as outlined by Schelling and Halperin in 1961:24 To reduce the
likelihood that the instruments of armed violence are used against
individuals, communities, or states; 2. To reduce the effects of armed
violence should it be employed; and 3. To reduce the resources employed
in the development, acquisition and deployment of the instruments of
armed violence (a deliberately more ambitious formula than that of
classical arms control). [In all efforts to advance a 'controlling the
means of violence' agenda]{.underline}, and particularly those directed
to the third goal, [the longer term, indirect effect should be to reduce
militarism and to promote cultures of peace]{.underline}. In other
words, [whilst control initiatives should only be directed at the
instruments and technologies of violence, the strategies of control
employed should]{.underline}, at the very least, [avoid further
embedding cultures of militarism and]{.underline}, ideally, **[have the
indirect effect of promoting global and local cultures of peace in the
longer term]{.underline}**. [Such a standard would mark a **significant
shift** from]{.underline} the [traditional]{.underline} practices of
[arms control]{.underline}, which were expressly [designed to seek
security]{.underline} in and [through an armed, militarized
world]{.underline}. Thus, whilst our formulation of CMV is quite
expansive in one sense, this constraint regarding the indirect effects
of its practices delimits the range of strategies that might be deployed
to promote such control. Most obviously perhaps, [it would rule out
strategies of forcible disarmament employed in contravention of
international law]{.underline}, and those now common practices of
proliferation control which have the effect of enshrining extravagant
military dominance. Conversely, [it would place a premium on the
adoption of strategies that are underpinned by processes of **dialogue
and mutual understanding**]{.underline}, processes that are based on,
and develop, what Booth and Wheeler have termed a 'security dilemma
sensibility' -- an appreciation of the fears that can be aroused in
others by one's own search for security.25 This is not to suggest that
we necessarily envisage controlling the means of violence as a vehicle
to completely eliminate the security risks associated with weapons and
the military potentials societies invent for supposedly civil
technologies -- at least not in the short-term. Wherever such risks are
deemed to exist, CMV will, like Cold War arms control, be geared to
managing and reducing risk rather than eliminating it, as we indicate in
the first two of our revised CMV goals. In contrast to Hedley Bull
however, we would suggest that this more hard-headed approach to the
weapons-security nexus is, ironically, more the preserve of radicals and
idealists than contemporary policy makers who, operating in their own
maze of unrealism, endlessly pursue the chimera of absolute security via
militarism and authoritarianism and the unilateral disarmament of
others. At the same time, given that identities and sensibilities are
not fixed [we can envisage a politics of c]{.underline}ontrolling the
[m]{.underline}eans of [v]{.underline}iolence [that contributes to the
development of more peaceful global cultures, in which armed violence,
both among and within political communities, becomes ever-less
acceptable]{.underline}. This is [not]{.underline} simply
[because]{.underline} we think [the reduction]{.underline} or even
elimination [of arms]{.underline} and other technologies of violence
[will eradicate military security dilemmas]{.underline} surrounding
technological potentials -- on its own it will not.
[Rather,]{.underline} it is [because the **forms and methods** of
CMV]{.underline} [can contribute to a politics that is
**transformatory**]{.underline}. In other words, [rather than CMV only
being possible when it is least needed]{.underline}, as critics have
suggested of arms control, we would argue that [what makes CMV most
relevant]{.underline} **[will not be the substance of
agreements]{.underline}** per se, [but the extent to which its practices
contribute to a transformatory politics that produces demilitarized
communities where **such control is no longer needed.**]{.underline}

### Landmine Ban Proves

#### landmine ban proves representational pluralism works best 

**Cooper,PhD, 12**

(Neil, IR@Bradford, *Humanitarian Arms Control and Processes of
Securitization: Moving Weapons Along the Security Continuum* in
[Reconceptualising Arms Control: Controlling the Means of
Violence]{.underline}, ed. Cooper & Mutimer)

Second, the analysis highlights the [relational elements that can be
involved in processes of securitization and desecuritization. In the
case of]{.underline} the [landmines]{.underline} ban [this manifested
itself in the way campaigners engaged in simultaneous processes of
securitization of APMs]{.underline} (with respect to the human as
referent object) [and]{.underline} (relative) [desecuritization (with
respect to the state]{.underline} as referent object) **[that worked to
mutually reinforce the case for a ban]{.underline}**. In the case of
pariah weapons generally, whilst there are a number of factors that
explain their stigmatization, one factor can be the way their particular
qualities are depicted as the antithesis of those possessed by
legitimized and particularly heroic weapons. Conversely, the
stigmatization of pariah weapons works to delineate other weapons as
normal and legitimate. There is therefore a process of mutual
constitution that is at work in the way different sets of weapons
technology are framed and understood.
