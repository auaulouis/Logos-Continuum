Even though Washington did not react strongly to China's emergence as
Saudi Arabia's largest trade partner in 2010, many [U.S. policymakers
are concerned that China will make Saudi Arabia an unwitting pawn in its
efforts to erode U.S. hegemony over global financial
markets]{.underline}. These concerns have risen sharply since Saudi
[Arabia's Vice Minister of Economy and Planning Mohammed al-Tuwaijri
announced on August 24 that **[Saudi Arabia planned
to]{.mark} [partially
[cover]{.mark}](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-china/saudis-may-seek-funding-in-chinese-yuan-idUSKCN1B413R) [its]{.mark}
budget [deficit in]{.mark} Chinese [yuan to reduce]{.mark} its financial
[dependency on the]{.mark} U.S. [dollar]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Many
American economists have expressed alarm at Saudi Arabia's willingness
to borrow in Chinese yuan, as [[Riyadh]{.mark}'s decision [could
cause]{.mark} other [oil-exporting countries to]{.mark} abandon the U.S.
dollar in [favor]{.mark} of [the
**"petro-yuan**]{.mark}**."**]{.underline} A marked decline in the use
of the U.S. dollar as the preferred credit-issuing currency by
oil-producing countries would greatly weaken the U.S. dollar's long-term
viability as a global reserve currency. As the United States views its
alliance with Saudi Arabia as the lynchpin of its Middle East strategy,
Washington will likely react strongly if Riyadh uses its influence
within OPEC to strengthen the Chinese yuan. **[As [Saudi Arabia remains
dependent on U.S. arms sales]{.mark} to pursue its geopolitical
objectives in the Middle East and counter Iran, intense [U.S. pressure
would]{.mark} likely [cause Riyadh to distance itself from
Beijing]{.mark}, limiting economic integration between the two
countries. In addition to setting informal limits on the scope and
nature of Saudi Arabia's economic partnership with China, [Riyadh's
dependence on U.S. military equipment restricts its ability to purchase
large quantities of Chinese arms]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Historically,
Saudi Arabia has only purchased arms from China to pressure the United
States into selling Riyadh highly sophisticated weaponry.
[[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia's [purchases of DF-3
missiles](http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/saudi-arabias-missile-messaging) from
China in 1987, and current [procurements of]{.mark} [Chinese stealth

#### Reducing arm sales triggers Saudi doubts about US reliability, which causes instigates Saudi to develop better relations with China.

[One such change is the rapid rise of Saudi
nationalism]{.underline}---especially among the country's large youth
population. As part of his reform agenda for transforming the kingdom,
[**Mohammed bin Salman has consciously sought to build [a new sense of
identity among Saudis]{.mark}**, [grounded in
nationalism]{.mark}]{.underline} rather than Wahhabism, the
fundamentalist religious sect that served as an ideological gateway for
terrorist groups such as al Qaeda and the Islamic State. [While largely
a positive development, **the nationalist tide could [have a double
edge]{.mark},**]{.underline} as I learned on an Atlantic Council trip to
Riyadh in February[. It was striking how many researchers, activists,
and **government [officials in Riyadh seemed]{.mark} defensive,
[resentful, and]{.mark} even [angry when asked about the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates**]{.underline}. ["We're getting sick and tired of having
our country reduced to its worst mistakes,"]{.underline} one woman said,
referring to the Khashoggi tragedy. Another said, "[Thanks to the crown
prince, the lives of millions of women are being positively transformed
in ways that our mothers couldn't even dream of]{.underline}. If the
United States can't appreciate the historical importance of what's
happening here, and chooses to focus only on our faults and trying to
change our leadership, then you're hurting our cause---and I'll oppose
you." [Whether justified or not[, **the sense of hurt**]{.mark}**,** of
being misunderstood and unfairly attacked**, even humiliated, [appeared
genuine]{.mark}. It's not hard to see how that kind of [raw populist
emotion]{.mark}, sufficiently stoked, [could result in
overreaction]{.mark}, miscalculation, [and counterproductive
policies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. At a minimum, [it's [a]{.mark} new
[variable]{.mark} in the equation [that U.S. policymakers]{.mark}, in
both the administration and Congress, [should]{.mark} be [tak]{.mark}ing
[into account]{.mark} as they calculate how best to pressure the kingdom
to change its most problematic behaviors**. Perhaps an even more
important change**, one that amplifies the potential risks of a possible
nationalist backlash, **is the emergence of great-power competitors with
the United States, especially China**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} It's still
the case that Saudis overwhelmingly prefer Washington to remain their
dominant global partner. If nothing else, they know that if the worst
were to happen, and war with Iran came, neither Russia nor China would
lift a finger to save the house of Saud. The U.S. military still
would---probably. But that "probably" is itself a growing problem, one
which has been getting worse over the past decade as two successive U.S.
presidents of both major parties have increasingly signaled their
determination to do less, not more, in the Middle East to guarantee the
security of partner states. Inevitably, [as the perception of U.S.
retrenchment deepens, the [Saudis are]{.mark} hedging their bets and
[developing new geostrategic options]{.mark}]{.underline}. Today,
**[[China is Saudi]{.mark} [Arabia's largest trading
partner]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It's among **[the biggest customers for
Saudi oil---while the U.S. shale boom increasingly poses the greatest
threat to Riyadh's economic prosperity]{.underline}**. Thanks in no
small part to decades of intellectual-property theft on a
world-historical scale, [[Chinese technology]{.mark}, including
military, intelligence, and cyber systems, as well as critical emerging
sectors such as artificial intelligence, [is]{.mark} increasingly
[closing the gap with]{.mark} [the]{.mark} best [U.S.]{.mark} high-tech
offerings.]{.underline} **[And Beijing, like Moscow, is perfectly
prepared to sell its most advanced capabilities to Riyadh with no
strings attached.]{.underline}** No complaints about the kingdom's human
rights record. No mentions of Khashoggi. No threats to withdraw support
as punishment for the war in Yemen. As was painfully obvious during
Mohammed bin Salman's recent values-free trip to China in February, [in
an increasingly ideological age of great-power competition that pits
Western-style liberal democracy against Beijing's model of authoritarian
capitalism, it's no secret in which camp the house of Saud feels most at
home. The only point being that the decades-old assumptions that have
governed the U.S.-Saudi relationship, while largely still valid, may be
on increasingly **shaky ground**.]{.underline} Before the Senate passed
a resolution earlier this month to end all U.S. support for the Saudi
war in Yemen, Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut confidently reassured his
colleagues, "The Saudis won't go somewhere else." The suggestion that
they might turn to another great power for weapons, he claimed, "is
belied by how this alliance has worked for years and the complication of
the Saudis turning around and choosing to go to another partner." While
I'd still bet that Murphy is more right than wrong on this issue, if
only due to the immediacy of the Iranian threat for Riyadh, I
increasingly lack his sense of certitude. **[[Saudi Arabia]{.mark}, U.S.
foreign policy[, and the]{.mark} global [balance of power are]{.mark}
all now [in flux]{.mark} in ways that are quite
unprecedented.]{.underline}** Even 30 years ago, the Saudis were capable
of some nasty surprises, such as purchasing intermediate-range ballistic
missiles from China capable of striking Israel. And [just a couple of
months ago, credible reports emerged that the Saudis have built a
facility for producing and testing solid-fuel ballistic missiles west of
Riyadh---one with features that bear striking similarities to comparable
facilities in China.]{.underline} **[[The danger that]{.mark} as [Saudi
doubts about]{.mark} [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates'
[reliability]{.mark} grow, so too will [their efforts]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} hedge by [look]{.mark}ing [for]{.mark} weapons and
[support]{.mark} (in Murphy's words) "somewhere else," including to
hostile great-power rivals of the United States]{.underline}**, is
probably greater than it's ever been in the history of the countries'
relationship. **[The recent decision to introduce Chinese-language
instruction at all stages of the Saudi educational system was no
accident]{.underline}**.

The 1944 Bretton Woods Conference looked forward to a coming victory for
the Allies in WWII and the desire for new economic stability. Since [the
U.S. at that time owned more gold than any nation, it offered to redeem
its currency in gold as a foundation for international
finance.]{.underline} This catapulted the dollar into the position of
the global reserve currency. Less than [three decades later, President
Nixon cancelled the dollar's convertibility into gold to alleviate
economic pressures related to the cost of the Vietnam
War, [inflation](https://www.sbcgold.com/blog/how-does-inflation-work/),
and national debt and deficit spending.]{.underline} This event was
known as the "[Nixon
Shock](https://www.sbcgold.com/blog/important-events-in-the-history-of-gold-as-currency/)."
**[[In order to maintain the dollar as the]{.mark} world's [reserve
currency]{.mark} [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates-Saudi Arabian Joint
Commission on Economic Cooperation was [established]{.mark} in 1974,
which resulted in [the]{.mark} creation of the
[petrodollar]{.mark}]{.underline}**. 1 The net result of these events is
that [for more than six decades [the **U.S. dollar has**]{.mark} **ruled
supreme, and has [brought unprecedented financial power to the
country]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, some see this position as
providing exorbitant privilege that has long been envied by other
governments, with [China and
Russia](https://www.sbcgold.com/blog/russia-china-distance-themselves-from-dollar/) at
the top of the list. [[The Chinese have developed a]{.mark}
multi-[pronged]{.mark}, [long-term
strategy](https://www.sbcgold.com/blog/chinas-long-term-strategy-focused-new-gold-standard/) to
shuffle the world's [economic structure]{.mark}, and replacing the U.S.
dollar as the world's [reserve
currency](https://www.sbcgold.com/blog/paper-currency-chinas-potential-gold-standard/) is
one of its primary goals]{.underline}. A major element of this is
**[eliminating the role of the petrodollar in the international trade of
oil. [The]{.mark} potential for this [shift]{.mark} happening [is
looming]{.mark}]{.underline}** as a near-term reality based on [comments
from Carl
Weinberg](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/11/china-will-compel-saudi-arabia-to-trade-oil-in-yuan--and-thats-going-to-affect-the-us-dollar.html),
chief economist and managing director at High Frequency Economics. He is
forecasting that China will soon (maybe in 2018) force the nation of
Saudi Arabia to sell its crude exports denominated in yuan, instead of
dollars. He explains, ' ...even as much as one or two years from now,
Chinese demand will dwarf U.S. demand. **[I believe [that yuan pricing
of oil is coming and as soon as the Saudis move to accept it]{.mark}--as
the Chinese will compel them to do--then [the rest of the oil market
will move along with them]{.mark}.']{.underline}** Major elements of
[the Chinese strategy include a crude oil futures contract and pricing
the yuan with convertibility into gold, therefore creating the
new [petroyuan](https://www.sbcgold.com/blog/petro-yuan-rising-must-read-truth-behind-chinas-plan-dethrone-dollar/)]{.underline}.
This, of course, is no longer an option with U.S. dollars.
[**[This]{.mark} market essentially [eliminates the role of the
U.S]{.mark}. [petrodollar]{.mark} and undermines America's ability to
use oil as a diplomatic tool**. The offer to back such trades with gold
provides a level of comfort to those trading partners not yet as
comfortable with the (petro)yuan as they are with the traditional
petrodollar]{.underline}. ^2^ What Will Happen If the Petrodollar Falls?
The discussion by Weinberg included his view of the impact of losing
status as the world reserve currency. He feels [**any such move would
lessen the demand for all U.S. securities and products**. The
projections made by Weinberg indicate [this move will eliminate as much
as \$600 billion to \$800 billion worth of dollar-denominated
transactions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such a reality will create greater
demand within China for everything from goods and services to securities
and other financial instruments. Of course, that is precisely
the [objective of
China](https://www.sbcgold.com/blog/china-pushes-harder-for-new-global-currency-to-replace-the-dollar/) of
this move on the global economic chessboard. The net result in any such
actions and economic movement is viewed by experts as strongly bullish
for gold and a boon to long-term holders of the yellow metal. The
ongoing [paper
currency](https://www.sbcgold.com/blog/dead-end-for-paper-money/) experiment
being conducted by the U.S. Federal Reserve would encounter significant
new hurdles[. As the historic levels of [national
debt](https://www.sbcgold.com/blog/relationship-national-debt-precious-metals-prices/) continue
to grow, any loss in value of or demand for dollars will make financing
that debt more difficult, much less increasing it. This could well start
the economic cascade some analysts have predicted and make gold much
more valuable in U.S. dollar terms.]{.underline}

One potential challenge to the US dollar's future as the global reserve
currency, identified by economist Robert Triffin, has come to be known
as the "Triffin Dilemma" or the "Triffin Paradox." Triffin (1960) argued
that the selection of a nation's currency as the global reserve currency
would create problems for that nation in the form of conflicting
economic demands. Such a nation would eventually experience a critical
balance of payments problem, particularly in its current account
deficit. Triffin criticised the Bretton Woods monetary system adopted at
the end of World War II which established what he interpreted as an
irreconcilable economic paradox for the United States. Whether the
United States will experience a future economic crisis cannot be known;
however, US debt has certainly grown enormously since the end of World
War II. [**[The unrelenting demand for]{.mark} [US dollars]{.mark}
created by the currency's establishment as the global reserve has
[enabled the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to]{.mark} continue to
[accrue debt]{.mark}, largely [without consequence]{.mark}**. As the
current system **compels nations to trade in US dollars**, [the United
States has been free to run large budget deficits]{.mark} and balance of
payments deficits without any apparent impact on the United
States]{.underline} (Hudson 2003, xii). However, **[[if the US dollar
was]{.mark} [to]{.mark} lose its position as the [global reserve
currency, the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [would]{.mark} likely
[experience a major]{.mark} economic [crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A
critical problem may yet emerge as the US issues more and more of its
currency while trying to maintain the value of the currency (Zhou 2009).
There is a continuing debate among scholars about the potential decline
of both the US dollar and US global hegemony, as well as the
implications of the ascendancy of China and cooperation between the
BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (Cox 2012). This
debate is broadly divided on the key issue of whether US hegemony is in
decline. The declinist view asserts that the rise of China and other
rival powers, in conjunction with the United States' surging national
debt, budget deficits and over-extension of the US military, have placed
the United States in an economic position that cannot be sustained, one
which will ultimately affect the US dollar (Layne 2012; Ruppert 2004).
That outlook is contested by those who assert that, **[despite the
contemporary problems for US finances, [there is]{.mark} at present
[neither a single currency]{.mark} nor a basket of currencies [that
could be]{.mark} readily [substituted for the US dollar as the global
reserve currency]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Stokes 2014; Prasad 2014;
Eichengreen 2011). [The United States has been subjected to
international political pressure regarding the US dollar's global
reserve status. The Governor of the Peoples Bank of China, Zhou
Xiaochuan, appealed in 2009 for a new global reserve currency,
disassociated from any specific nation, arguing that stronger economic
growth would be fostered and the world economy would be
stabilized]{.underline} (Anderlini 2009). [The former Russian President,
Dmitry Medvedev, and the former Chinese President, Hu Jintao, have made
similar demands]{.underline} (Capella 2014). However, without a majority
of nations demanding a new reserve currency, it appears unlikely that
this political rhetoric will affect the dollar-centric world economy.
**[The establishment of the AIIB has been interpreted by some as a
critical challenge to US hegemony, and the US dollar as the global
reserve, from an increasingly powerful China.]{.underline}** The AIIB
will initially be capitalised with \$50 billion, rising eventually to
\$100 billion, and will be critical to China's New Silk Road project
(Donnan 2015). Strategically, the New Silk Road project will draw into
China's economic orbit the countries of Central and South Asia. Through
massive civil engineering projects, the region will be incorporated into
China's expanding economic and security infrastructure (Escobar 2015).
However, as Chossudovsky (2015) has explained, While the creation of
BRICS has significant geopolitical implications, both the AIIB as well
as the proposed BRICS Development Bank (NDB) and its Contingency Reserve
Arrangement (CRA) are dollar denominated entities. Unless they are
coupled with a multi-currency system of trade and credit, they do not
threaten dollar hegemony. Quite the opposite, they tend to sustain and
extend dollar denominated lending. (Chossudovsky 2015) Despite these
facts, the United States strongly opposed the formation of the AIIB, and
lobbied other nations against joining. Robert Kahn (2015) of the CFR has
argued that the founding of the AIIB reflects China's displeasure at
existing institutional arrangements in Asia, such as the Asian
Development Bank led by Japan, as well as the lack of reform at the IMF.
While the creation of the AIIB is an important development, it is not an
institution of the same magnitude or influence as, nor is it a rival to,
the IMF or the World Bank. International trading arrangements that avoid
using the US currency have emerged as a potential, albeit limited,
challenge to the status of the US dollar as the global reserve currency.
**[[The invasion of Iraq]{.underline}]{.mark}**, according to W.R.
Clark, **[[was motivated]{.mark} by the neo-conservatives in the Bush
administration [to stop Saddam]{.mark} Hussain [from trading]{.mark} oil
[in Euros]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Clark 2005, 29). Similarly, Swanson
calculates that [military action was taken against Gaddafi's government
in 2011 under the pretext of "humanitarian intervention."]{.underline}
[However, it is noted that the Gaddafi government was also preparing to
move Libya's oil settlements away from the dollar to a gold-backed
currency]{.underline} (Swanson 2011). **[Several other Middle Eastern
states, including [Saudi Arabia]{.mark}, Kuwait and Qatar, [have
attempted to avoid the]{.mark} US [dollar]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [oil
trading]{.mark}, a move [that could have]{.mark} an [impact]{.mark} upon
the demand for US dollars and [US Treasury bonds]{.mark}, as well as
long-standing financial and security agreements with the United
States]{.underline}** (Fisk 2009). Russia, China and Iran have sought to
substitute their own currencies, in place of the US dollar, in some
bilateral and multilateral trade arrangements, in part to mitigate the
imposition of sanctions (Durden 2014). In September 2015, the Russian
government began drafting a bill that would eliminate the US dollar from
trade between the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). This plan
emerged in the context of continuing political tensions between the
United States and Russia in relation to the Ukraine crisis. [By avoiding
the US dollar in regional trade, President Vladimir Putin believed that
Russia would be less susceptible to sanctions imposed by the United
States]{.underline} (Russia Today 2015). President Putin ordered an
alternate payment system to be created, one which does not use the US
dollar (Pascali 2014). [Although not a direct challenge to the US
dollar's global reserve currency status, **the substitution of other
currencies for the dollar in international trade could have an impact
upon the US economy**]{.underline}. Bilateral trade between Russia and
China may be increasingly important within the world economy of the
future. [Major energy deals, such as the new China-Russia gas pipeline
which will supply Russian gas to China for the next 30 years, will not
be traded in US dollars]{.underline} (Pizzi 2014). This expanding
bilateral energy trade between China and Russia has the capacity to
affect US financial deficits; a potential decreased demand for dollars
could impact US Treasury securities (Koenig 2015). Recently, Russia and
China have been cooperating to develop the CIPS. [The purpose of this
system is to avoid the Western-operated Society for Worldwide Interbank
Financial Telecommunication]{.underline} (SWIFT), [a privately owned
international payments system used by over 10,000 financial
institutions.]{.underline} Koenig (2016) argues, "It would be a
formidable alternative to the western dollar based monetary Ponzi
scheme." The payment system will be used by Brazil India Russian and
China (BRIC) nations as well as Shanghai Cooperation (SCO) nations and
has the potential to be a powerful alternative to a vital US hegemonic
system. **[The continuation of the dollar's position as the global
reserve currency is imperative for the United States and has been
acknowledged as such in reports by the National Intelligence
Council]{.underline}** (NIC). A 2012 NIC report stated that,
historically, "US dominance has been buttressed by the dollar's role as
the global reserve currency" (NIC 2012, 105). **[[If the dollar was
abandoned as the global reserve currency]{.mark}, the NIC has stated
that [it "would be]{.mark} one of [the sharpest]{.mark} indications of a
[loss of US global]{.mark} economic [position]{.mark}, strongly
[undermining]{.mark} Washington's [political influence
too]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (NIC 2012, xii). The NIC has speculated that
the mere downgrading of the US dollar's reserve status "may force the US
to consider more carefully how the conduct of its foreign policy affects
the dollar" (NIC 2008, 12). As these reports from the NIC indicate,
**[[the retention of the dollar's global]{.mark} reserve [status is
vital to]{.mark} the future of [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates'
economy, foreign policy and its [hegemonic power
globally]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

As Yale economist Robert Tiffin explained in the 1950s, [**if a
country's currency is [the international reserve currency]{.mark}**,
then it has no choice but to [run a]{.mark} current [account
deficit]{.mark}]{.underline}. If a replacement is found, as the dollar
replaced the British pound in the 1920s, [it may be more likely to have
trade surpluses -- which is what Trump has said he wants]{.underline}.
The reason is simple: **[[trading nations]{.mark} all over the world
[have to accumulate dollars to]{.mark} use [in trading]{.mark} with each
other. When [China buys oil from Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}**, for
example, **[it pays [in]{.mark} U.S. [dollars]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
So, more U.S. dollars flow out of the US than flow in, and bingo, you
have a big current account deficit. On the other hand, **[[having the
dollar as the international reserve currency creates]{.mark} what's
called "[monetary seignorage]{.mark}," which is what the U.S. government
earns by having all those dollars floating around
overseas.]{.underline}** It costs almost nothing to print money, but
[China, Russia and everyone else pay a full dollar in goods and services
for that greenback.]{.underline} [There have been efforts to replace the
dollar as the reserve currency for some
time ](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2015/10/03/dominant-and-dangerous)--
China even blamed the dollar's international role as one of the causes
of the financial crisis in 2008. The problem is that **[no other
currency has stepped forward as a good replacement. What's
changed?]{.underline}** The weaponization of the dollar by Washington.
[When [Trump]{.mark} re-imposed sanctions on Iran last week, he [warned
that **any company doing deals with the Iranians in dollars
would**]{.mark} **also [be subject to sanctions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Several Russian companies are also under U.S. sanctions. While it is a
somewhat different issue, Turkey is also angry that a tweet by Trump
last week doubling [[tariffs on imports]{.mark} of Turkish steel has
[caused Turkey's currency]{.mark}, the lira, [to crash]{.mark} more than
[20 percent against the US dollar.]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[That has
caused a stampede by investors out of emerging]{.mark} market
[currencies]{.mark} everywhere.** Lavrov]{.underline} is visiting Turkey
and [told a press conference that]{.underline} "unilateral enforcement
measures are illegitimate in international affairs," a reference to the
American sanctions. "[One way to counter these illegitimate barriers and
restrictions is we can use national currencies on our bilateral trade,"
he added.]{.underline} Lavrov said Russia already uses local currencies
in trade with China and Iran and that a number of other countries are
also thinking about doing the same. China has been active in setting up
trade deals in its own currency, the renminbi. "[**I strongly believe
that abuse of the role the U.S. dollar plays as an international
currency will eventually result in its role being undermined**," Lavrov
said]{.underline}. "A growing number of countries --- even those not
affected by US sanctions --- will more and more stay away from the
dollar and will rely on more reliable partners using their (own)
currency." While Lavrov may be right, the use of national currencies
goes only so far. **[[Will traders in China]{.mark}, for example, [be
content taking]{.mark} Turkish [lira]{.mark} in payment for goods
shipped [when]{.mark} they know that [the currency will be worth]{.mark}
much [less by the time the ship reaches its
destination]{.mark}?]{.underline}** [It's a little bit like the way the
English language has become the lingua franca of international business.
Although they may not like it, [you]{.mark} often [hear Chinese
businessmen speaking with]{.mark} their [German]{.mark} and French
[counterparts in English**. It's the same for**]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[the dollar: it's]{.mark} safe, [dependable and easy to
exchange]{.mark}.]{.underline}** So, while President Trump might be
happier with lower trade deficits because the dollar is no longer the
international reserve currency, it's probably not going to happen soon.

**[[Attendant to this crisis]{.mark} of fiscal legitimacy [are
increasing challenges to the]{.mark} primacy of the [US
dollar]{.mark}. The standing of the dollar allows the United States to
shape the global economic and political system and offers it greater
influence abroad, greater flexibility at home, and greater insulation
from international crises.18 For those who would downplay the benefits
of dollar dominance, [the British experience is instructive]{.mark}.
Prior to World War II, the British pound sterling was the primary
international currency, thereby allowing Britain to finance military
expenditures and manage its wartime debt. Once the sterling was eclipsed
by the dollar in the postwar years, [Britain was no longer able to
finance its war deb]{.mark}t, a problem that contributed to its economic
decline and exacerbated persistent financial crises during the
1960shus]{.underline}**.19 **[T]{.underline}**he sustainability of the
dollar as the leading global reserve currency has been a near constant
concern since the 1960s. During this time, foreign dollar reserves began
to outgrow US gold reserves, and many international actors began to
question the United States' ability to convert dollars to gold at the
fixed official rate specified by Bretton Woods. As this confidence
declined, speculative attacks against the dollar abounded. The United
States eventually abandoned the gold standard, but the dollar has
retained its dominance ever since. **[Thus, [anyone decrying the
dollar's]{.mark} current [strength risks crying
wolf]{.mark}]{.underline}**. 16      Nevertheless, in the wake of the
Great Recession, there are convinc- ing signs that we are headed for a
restructuring of the international monetary system as faith in the
dollar faltered. The reality is that countries are now questioning the
wisdom of carrying debt obligations solely in dollars, and they are
moving toward baskets of currencies and alternate trading conventions
and currencies to reduce their reliance on the dollar. **[The portion of
global reserves in dollars declined from approximately 72 percent in
2000 to 62 percent in 2012 as the rest of the world attempted to
decouple from the US economy.]{.underline}** The Chinese have begun to
use their own currency, the renminbi, and reserves in certain trading
situations and with some partners with more frequency. China recently
completed a \$1.08 billion currency swap deal with Kazakhstan and has
similar arrangements with Argentina, Belarus, Hong Kong, Indonesia,
Malaysia, South Korea, Ireland, Argentina, and Iceland. China has also
reached agreements with Russia and Brazil to gradually eliminate the
dollar from bilateral trade.20 All five of the BRICS (**[Brazil, Russia,
India, China, and South Africa, all of which have large, rapidly growing
economies) have taken significant steps toward trading in their own
currencies, diversifying their foreign exchange reserves, and hedging
their bets against the growing instability of the dollar and the
euro.]{.underline}** Prior to the G8 summit of 2009, China, Russia, and
India explicitly called for an end to dollar dominance. On January 7,
2011, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) produced a paper outlining a
plan for replacing the dollar with Special Drawing Rights
(SDRs)---IMFissued currency defined in terms of the weighted average of
the dollar, euro, yen, and pound. The plan would create a liquid bond
market for SDRs and thereby elevate the IMF to the de facto role of the
world central bank.21 This portends a world of multiple reserve
currencies, one in which the dollar serves as the primary rudder,
steering a steady course to prevent erratic devaluations, but in which
the currents are more volatile than they have been for decades. In this
scenario, the euro, the British pound, the Swiss franc, and the renminbi
would play enhanced roles as regional currencies for Europe and Asia,
thereby limiting US influence in these areas. A more dangerous scenario
is an intensification of what James Rickards has termed "Currency War
III." According to Rickards, this war began in 2010 and involved
competitive devaluations of the yuan, dollar, and euro. These concerns
were echoed publicly in 2013 by finance ministries and central banks. It
is important to note that the biggest threat is not that yuan
devaluation directly damages the US economy. The true threat is
systemic. The current China-US monetary relationship is unsustainable
and brings the fragility of the entire international monetary system
into sharp relief. As Rickards contended, by 2011 both 20Economic
historian Niall Ferguson has dubbed this presently symbiotic yet
ultimately dysfunctional rela- tionship "Chimerica." In order to
maintain employment for its massive population, China must keep its
exports attractive to American consum- ers and keep the yuan tied to the
dollar. As such, China must continue to buy dollar assets and increase
its account surpluses. It is caught in a "dollar trap." China's current
exchange-rate policy thus ironically helps to preserve dollar
dominance.23 Chimerica is, for Ferguson, highly unstable. A sudden
deterioration in political relations, perhaps stemming from a clash over
natural resources or Taiwan, could trigger a major war and a
corresponding collapse of the international financial
system.24 **[Currently, [China is the most competitive player]{.mark} in
the so-called cur- rency wars. Yet all major powers are attempting to
influence the relative value of their currencies, a [ruthless
competition]{.mark} that [places the]{.mark} entire [global]{.mark}
monetary [system at risk]{.mark}. The currency war need not devolve into
actual war for it to prove disastrous. [A small]{.mark} but systemically
critical [event]{.mark}---such as the collapse of the Spanish bond
market---[could ignite a widespread loss of confidence]{.mark} in paper
currencies and a massive transition to hard assets (gold) led by a
shrewd and forward-leaning competitor state such as Russia or
China.25]{.underline}**

### 2NC -- Arm Sales Key

#### Arms sales for a petrodollar is an *[explicit but secret QPQ]{.underline}* between the US and Saudi Arabia -- analysis of historical documents proves Saudi commitment to petrodollar recycling is *[contingent on transfer of US defense articles]{.underline}*

**[Waterman 18]{.underline}** (K David Waterman, PhD in Politics @
University of Exeter, *The Political Economy of U.S. Military*
*Strategy*, Dissertation, pgs. 241-244,
<https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10871/36040/WatermanK.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y>)

Further [**[evidence for a]{.mark} tight [coupling between
US-Saudi]{.mark} economic and [security relationships can]{.mark} also
[be found in]{.mark}** the negotiation and formation of the process of
**'[petrodollar recycling']{.mark} after the 1973 Oil
Crisis**]{.underline}. Petrodollar recycling was the process by which
[Gulf states 'recycled' their large and growing trade surpluses back
into Western, primarily American, markets to fund their purchases of
oil]{.underline}. As I mentioned earlier, the price of oil shot up in
1973 due to the oil embargo, meaning that Western states were now paying
two to three times the price for oil than they had the year before,
forcing many to run a current account deficit. [This was made worse by
the fact that the OPEC nations could not increase their imports
commensurate with this increase, thus making these current account
deficits a structural feature of the international trading system. **The
OPEC nations therefore needed to recycle these funds back into Western
states in order to permit them to continue buying oil.**]{.underline}425
This particular concern also dovetailed with talk from OPEC of pegging
the price of oil to the IMF's 'special drawing right' (SDR) instead of
the dollar, a result of the dollar's weakening as well as its earlier
suspension from gold convertibility. To cut a long story short, **[[the
United States]{.mark} got what it wanted on both issues, [getting OPEC
to retain the dollar]{.mark} as the reference and invoice currency for
oil exports, as well as securing considerable petrodollar recycling into
US markets.]{.underline}** In particular, the [American's were keen to
[set up a]{.mark} semi-formal [system of recycling]{.mark} to enable
OPEC surpluses to be directed into US markets and back out to other oil
consuming nations that would need it]{.underline}, helping to circumvent
the fear that private markets may do this inefficiently.426 From what
evidence is available the [**Americans [offered the Saudis]{.mark} a
number of [incentives]{.mark} to agree to such a deal**, focused
**[on]{.mark} both economic and [military
factors]{.mark}**.]{.underline} On the economic side, the Saudis were
offered greater institutional influence with IMF in the form of a quota
increase (as they had desired), in addition to tailored and special
access to US government debt markets in the form of a special agreement
that circumvented the bidding process.427 With further motivation to
invest derived from the establishment of the U.S.-Saudi Arabian Joint
Commission on Economic Cooperation in 1974, which, alongside a number of
formal meetings, helped to promote Saudi investment in US infrastructure
and industrial expansion.428 In addition to his, however, **[all sources
make mention of a definitive defence component to these myriad
arrangements]{.underline}**. For instance[, [a state department
memo]{.mark}]{.underline} detailing a Treasury visit to Saudi Arabia in
1974 [[noted that]{.mark} ["**the two countries are prepared** to
expand]{.mark} and give more concrete expression to [cooperation
in]{.mark} the field of economics]{.underline}\...**[and in the supply
of the Kingdom's requirements for [defensive
purposes]{.mark}]{.underline}**." 429 Likewise, the aforementioned CRS
report also suggests that "in the wake of the embargo, both Saudi and
U.S. officials worked to re-anchor the bilateral relationship on the
basis of shared opposition to Communism, renewed military cooperation,
and through economic initiatives..."430 But much like before, there is
little direct mention of what was actually said or arranged.
Nonetheless, [**the available [data is]{.mark} certainly [indicative of
a]{.mark} substantially enhanced [defense relationship]{.mark}.** In
1974 Saudi weapons imports inflected upward, effectively quadrupling, a
move that was sustained throughout the decade.]{.underline}431 Likewise,
the main source of these goods was from the United States. With \$1.8
billion of the \$3.6 billion of arms imported from 1975-1979 having been
supplied by the United States, with the next largest chunk, \$900
million, supplied by the United Kingdom.432 Moreover, a large
proportion - approximately 40%, - of this was reputably in "the
non-weapons category" particularly military construction projects.433
Whilst these details are somewhat scant, and certainly not as solid as
we would like, [there is nonetheless an evident and significant military
linkage underlying this particular case. Despite the fact that the
economic factors may have provided a strong incentive for Saudi
investments, given the inflection in arms sales between the dyad, the
pervasive mention of defense elements in these agreements, and a strong
continued security relationship, **the deployment of a security linkage
is hard to dismiss**]{.underline}. At the same time, however, the case
also reminds us of the importance of specific configurations of
variables and contexts in the deployment and effectiveness of foreign
policy tools and assets.

#### Arm sales and guaranteed military assistance ensure Saudi remains loyal to the dollar.

**[[Saudi Arabia's threat to sell its oil in currencies other than the
dollar]{.mark} if the United States enacts anti-OPEC legislation [is an
empty one]{.mark}]{.underline}**, but it illustrates the extent of
tensions between the two governments over oil prices. **[Senior Saudi
officials have discussed a plan to stop invoicing oil in dollars and
switch to other currencies if the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels
Act (NOPEC), recently introduced in Congress, becomes
law.]{.underline}** The threat has been communicated to top officials in
Washington and leaked to signal the strength of the kingdom's opposition
("Saudi Arabia threatens to ditch dollar oil trades to stop NOPEC",
Reuters, April 5). **[Invoicing [oil sales in]{.mark} euros or [yuan
would]{.mark} aim to [damage the U.S. dollar]{.mark}'s status as the
petro-recycling currency [and its reserve status]{.mark} more generally,
weakening its value and [taking aim at U.S. financial dominance]{.mark}.
In practice, [the threat is not credible since the kingdom
relies]{.mark} almost totally [on the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[for its security, including purchases of armaments]{.mark} and
training, intelligence sharing, [and support in]{.mark} its conflict in
[Yemen]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[The kingdom could not]{.mark} afford
to [jeopardise its security relationship]{.mark} and close ties with the
present U.S. administration.]{.underline}** But it does illustrate the
strain on relations that has emerged between the kingdom and the United
States, especially the White House, over the desirable level of oil
prices. Those tensions are likely to intensify as the United States
gears up for congressional and presidential elections in November 2020.
On most issues, Saudi Arabia's rulers and the White House are more
closely aligned than ever before -- especially in their shared
commitment to confronting Iran. Saudi Arabia is central to the regional
security system the Trump administration has been trying to assemble to
contain Iran's influence in the Middle East. **[In turn, [Saudi Arabia
has become increasingly dependent on the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[for its]{.mark} internal and external [security as its conflict with
Iran escalates]{.mark}, both in the diplomatic arena and in wars being
fought by proxy in the region]{.underline}**. The U.S and Saudi
governments need each other. On the issue of oil prices, however, the
two disagree sharply. President Donald Trump has made clear he wants oil
prices to remain below \$70 per barrel in a series of messages posted on
Twitter and delivered in television interviews. Saudi Arabia, by
contrast, needs prices well over \$70 and probably over \$80 to shore up
its government finances, pay for an expensive economic transformation
and stem the deterioration in its own balance of payments. Like most
first-term presidents, Trump's over-riding priority is to be re-elected.
All other policy considerations will be subordinated to that aim. Other
U.S. officials may pursue various policy priorities. But the president's
and vice-president's names are the only ones on the ballot which puts
re-election at the forefront of their calculations. Since the oil shocks
of the 1970s, gasoline prices have often been a high-profile issue in
election campaigns and the run-up to November 2020 will be no different.
The president has calculated, correctly, his marginal voter next year
will be a motorist in the Midwest, so he needs moderately low gasoline
prices, at least until after election day. Trump is not the first
president who has tried to exert pressure on Saudi Arabia to lower oil
prices in the run up to a vote. In 2000, Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson mounted a very public campaign to press Saudi Arabia to
increase oil output and lower prices ("U.S. urges OPEC to increase oil
production", New York Times, Sept. 7, 2000). Richardson pressed publicly
for output increases and even called up the kingdom's oil minister in
the middle of an OPEC meeting. Richardson's intervention, which
irritated the kingdom, coincided with the Clinton White House's efforts
to help the presidential campaign of Vice-President Al Gore.
COUNTER-LEVERAGE **[So far, NOPEC bills introduced into the U.S. House
of Representatives and Senate have made little progress, and the
administration has adopted a non-committal attitude to
them.]{.underline}** If oil prices rise to \$80 or more, however, the
bills may start to make more progress through the legislative process as
lawmakers respond to pressure from their constituents. The higher the
prices rise and the nearer election day comes, the greater the prospect
the NOPEC legislation will start to move forward. At \$85-\$90, Congress
will take more notice. At \$90-\$95 the bill could make it to the
president's desk. And at \$95-\$100, the president might direct the
attorney-general to initiate legal proceedings. **[Saudi Arabia cannot
be sure whether the president would sign or veto a NOPEC bill if it was
approved by both chambers and presented to him. In fact, the president
has every incentive to maintain constructive ambiguity since it provides
a useful source of leverage to ensure Saudi Arabia cooperates with his
re-election effort.]{.underline}** In circumstances where oil prices are
high and rising, the president might demand an output increase and lower
oil prices in exchange for vetoing the bill. **[NOPEC is therefore a
useful bargaining chip for the White House,]{.underline}** and the
threat to switch invoicing away from the dollar is the kingdom's
response, an attempt to develop a form of counter-leverage. More
importantly, the threat to the dollar's reserve currency status is
intended to give the kingdom's **[lo]{.underline}**bbyists in Washington
a talking point to raise with lawmakers and within the administration.
While the threat may not be credible, it is meant to signal the
kingdom's concern and is intended to help create a firewall to keep
NOPEC legislation bottled up in Congress and as far from the president's
desk as possible.

### 2NC -- Petrodollar Key

#### If Saudi ditched the petro-dollar, it would undermine the dollar hegemony---this weakens our ability to enforce sanctions.

The chances of the U.S. bill known as NOPEC coming into force are slim
and Saudi Arabia would be unlikely to follow through, but the fact
Riyadh is considering such a drastic step is a sign of the kingdom's
annoyance about potential U.S. legal challenges to OPEC. **[[In
the]{.mark} unlikely [event Riyadh]{.mark} [were to ditch the dollar, it
would]{.mark} [undermine its status as the world's main reserve
currency]{.mark}, reduce Washington's clout in global trade [and
weaken]{.mark} its [ability to enforce sanctions]{.mark} on nation
states]{.underline}**. "[[The Saudis know they have the dollar as the
nuclear option]{.mark},]{.underline}" one of the sources familiar with
the matter said. "[The Saudis say: let the Americans pass NOPEC and it
would be the U.S. economy that would fall apart," another source
said]{.underline}. Saudi Arabia's energy ministry did not respond to a
request for comment. A U.S. state department official said: "as a
general matter, we don't comment on pending legislation." The U.S.
Energy Department did not respond to a request for comment. Energy
Secretary Rick Perry has said that NOPEC could lead to unintended
consequences. NOPEC, or the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act,
was first introduced in 2000 and aims to remove sovereign immunity from
U.S. antitrust law, paving the way for OPEC states to be sued for
curbing output in a bid to raise oil prices. While the bill has never
made it into law despite numerous attempts, the legislation has gained
momentum since U.S. President Donald Trump came to office. Trump said he
backed NOPEC in a book published in 2011 before he was elected, though
he not has not voiced support for NOPEC as president. **[[Trump
has]{.mark} instead [stressed]{.mark} the [importance of U.S-Saudi
relations]{.mark}, including sales of U.S. military equipment, even
after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last
year.]{.underline}** [[A]{.mark} move [by Saudi Arabia to ditch the
dollar would resonate]{.mark} [well with]{.mark} big non-OPEC oil
producers such as [Russia]{.mark} as well as major consumers [China and
the E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion, which have been calling for moves
to diversify global trade away from the dollar to dilute U.S. influence
over the world economy.]{.underline} Russia, which is subject to U.S.
sanctions, has tried to sell oil in euros and China's yuan but the
proportion of its sales in those currencies is not significant.
Venezuela and Iran, which are also under U.S. sanctions, sell most of
their oil in other currencies but they have done little to challenge the
dollar's hegemony in the oil market. However, [[if]{.mark} a
long-standing U.S. ally such as [Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [joined the club
of non-dollar]{.mark} oil sellers [it would]{.mark} be a far more
significant move likely to [gain traction within the industry]{.mark}.
Saudi Arabia controls a 10th of global oil production, roughly on par
with its main rivals - the United States and Russia]{.underline}. Its
oil firm **[Saudi Aramco holds the crown of the world's biggest oil
exporter with sales of \$356 billion last year]{.underline}**. Depending
on prices, [oil is estimated to represent 2 percent to 3 percent of
global gross domestic product]{.underline}. At the current price of \$70
per barrel, the annual value of global oil output is \$2.5 trillion. Not
all of those oil volumes are traded in the U.S. currency but at least 60
percent is traded via tankers and international pipelines with the
majority of those deals done in dollars. Trading in derivatives such as
oil futures and options is mainly dollar denominated. The top two global
energy exchanges, ICE and CME, traded a billion lots of oil derivatives
in 2018 with a nominal value of about \$5 trillion. Just the prospect of
NOPEC has already had implications for the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries. Qatar, one of the core Gulf OPEC members, quit the
group in December because of the risk NOPEC could harm its U.S.
expansion plans.

**[The new benchmark is so significant because [it directly
challenges]{.mark} the dollar-dominated pricing scheme of crude oil
markets---commonly known as [the petrodollar system---which]{.mark}
helps to [undergird the dollar's]{.mark} status as the
[international]{.mark} reserve [currency]{.mark}.]{.underline}** That
arrangement dates back to 1974, when [**[Saudi Arabia]{.mark} and other
regional oil suppliers, [in exchange fo]{.mark}r sustained [U.S.
military aid]{.mark} and equipment**, [agreed to]{.mark} exclusively
[accept]{.mark} the Greenback for oil sales and---perhaps most
importantly---to [invest]{.mark} their [oil revenues into]{.mark} U.S.
treasuries. This process]{.underline}, often referred [to as
"[petrodollar]{.mark} recycling," is a win-win for all involved:
oil-rich states enjoy a safe place to store their petro-profits, and the
United States gains a key source of financing for its deficit
spending]{.underline}. With few exceptions, any country wishing to
purchase oil must first obtain U.S. dollars, creating a significant
demand for the currency in international markets. Thus, the petro-dollar
also plays a critical role in generating global confidence in the
dollar. And in currency markets, confidence is king. **[The widespread
pricing and trading of crude in yuan, or [the petro-yuan, would
shake]{.mark} this [global confidence]{.mark} and simultaneously serve a
number of strategic purposes for the People's Republic]{.underline}**.
The Chinese government has long sought to internationalize the yuan,
also known as the RMB, to boost its economic power and reduce its
dependence on the dollar. [As the world's largest crude oil importer and
primary source of investment capital for oil-producing nations, China
would naturally benefit from using its own currency over that of a
geopolitical competitor.]{.underline}

### AT: Saudi Not Key

#### Trump depends on Saudi Arabia to increase Oil production in order to maintain a low cost per barrel. 

**[McNally 19]{.underline}** (Robert, an energy expert, author and

[President Donald [Trump's decision to end Iran
sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline} waivers while hammering the Maduro regime
in Venezuela [raises the stakes on his [bet that oil prices will remain
stable]{.mark}.]{.underline} Those stakes extend beyond economic growth,
happy motorists and his re-election. [For investors and industry, [they
also include US-Saudi relations]{.mark}, proposed anti-Opec legislation
in Washington and the start of IMO 2020, a sweeping global regulation on
marine fuel**. By [ending Iran's oil]{.mark} export [sanctions waivers
on a promise of higher supply from Saudi Arabia]{.mark} and the United
Arab Emirates, Mr Trump is gambling oil prices will not repeat last
year's trajectory when Brent jumped to \$86**]{.underline}. His bet this
year is not unreasonable and is safer than last year's in so far as
Iran's exports are half of 2018's levels while the spare capacity of
Opec and its partners is almost 500,000 barrels a day higher. So far, so
good: US inventory builds and last week's presidential tweets have
knocked crude prices back to near the level when the US announced zero
waivers. **[[Ample supply from]{.mark} galloping US shale and [Saudi
Arabia]{.mark} may [yet keep crude prices in
check]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [But the risk of a crude price increase
remains acute. **Riyadh will honour its promise to offset lower Iranian
exports but remains wary of oversupplying the market**]{.underline}.
Sizeable disruption risks remain in Venezuela and Libya. And Tehran,
increasingly backed into a corner, can make trouble in regional oil
chokepoints such as the Strait of Hormuz, potentially leading to
unintentional escalation, even if it is unlikely to directly attack the
US or its regional adversaries. Spare capacity is still low, and will
fall further as Saudi production rises, and is concentrated in the Gulf.
Commercial inventories in developed countries are snug in days of cover.
Combined, these conditions increase the possibility that other risks to
supplies --- like the recent halt of 700,000 b/d of Russian crude
exports due to contamination or calls by Venezuela's opposition leader
for the military to overthrow. Mr Trump would be deeply disgruntled, to
say the least, by an oil price rise, and misaligned expectations could
lead to fierce blowback against Riyadh. [[The president]{.mark} recently
said in a tweet that he [secured a promise from Riyadh]{.mark} and other
allies [to]{.mark} "more than [make up the Oil Flow]{.mark} in our now
Full Sanctions on Iranian Oil".]{.underline} But Mr Trump neither counts
nor cares about barrels: he only wants and expects low gasoline prices,
full stop. The risk here, as last year demonstrated, is that [singular
supply offsets do not guarantee stable, let alone lower, prices in a
global oil market with many moving parts]{.underline}. Should oil prices
take off again despite Saudi-led output, Mr Trump's inevitable and
irascible insistence for more oil would collide with Riyadh's concerns
about oversupplying the market, especially with new pipelines poised to
debottleneck US shale oil production in the Permian later this year.
**[[A price increase would revive congressional support for
NOPEC]{.mark}, a bill that would allow the Department of Justice to sue
foreign oil producers under the Sherman Antitrust Act]{.underline}**.
Frequently introduced over the past 20 years, NOPEC has failed due to
opposition from congressional leadership and the White House on concerns
about price volatility and hurting other US interests. [But with
congressional displeasure with Riyadh already simmering, an oil price
rise from already lofty levels]{.underline} (in the Trump
administration's view) [would bring US motorists and Washington to a
boil.]{.underline} Then [there is IMO 2020, the requirement for ships to
reduce sulphur emissions from January 1 2020 but which will begin
roiling shipping, logistics, global trade and refinery margins for
petroleum products later this year. So far, IMO 2020 has attracted
little notice in Washington.]{.underline} But the International Energy
Agency has warned that IMO will cause diesel prices to rise. **[While
[turbulence in diesel markets is]{.mark} expected to last only a year or
two, the timing coincides with the US presidential election campaign,
[potentially threatening]{.mark} Mr [Trump's chances of
re-election]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The higher crude prices are when Mr
Trump learns about the UN regulation's potential price impacts, the more
startled and disgruntled he will be. Of course, [absorbing a diesel
price rise is easier if crude oil prices are closer to \$50 than \$80.
So the president may pressure Saudi Arabia for more oil and blame Opec+
for any price increases that occur]{.underline}. But he could also opt
for dramatic options ranging from upsetting IMO 2020 implementation to
tapping the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve. **[If Mr Trump is lucky,
ample and timely oil from US shale and Opec+ producers will smooth the
transition to tougher sanctions and prevent oil price rises. But if his
gamble does not pay off then --- as the naval expression goes --- stand
by for heavy rolls.]{.underline}**

### AT: Saudi Won't Switch

#### Saudi Arabia is incentivized to adopt the Petro-Yuan because Chinese demand for Saudi Oil has dwarfed US demand.

Portsmouth with a BA in Journalism, "China will 'compel' Saudi Arabia to
trade oil in yuan --- and that's going to affect the US dollar," CNBC,

Carl Weinberg, chief economist and managing director at High Frequency
Economics, said **[[Beijing stands to become the most dominant global
player in oil demand since China usurped the U.S. as the "biggest oil
importer on the planet]{.mark}."]{.underline}** Saudi Arabia has "[to
pay attention to this because even as much as **one or two years from
now, [Chinese demand will dwarf U.S. demand]{.mark}**,]{.underline}"
Weinberg said. "I believe that yuan pricing of oil is coming and as soon
as the Saudis move to accept it --- as the Chinese will compel them to
do --- then the rest of the oil market will move along with them." In
recent years, [[several nations opposed]{.mark} to [the dollar being the
world's reserve currency]{.mark} have progressively sought to try and
abandon it. For instance, Russia and [China have]{.mark} sought to
operate in a non-dollar environment when trading oil.]{.underline}
**[Both countries have also [increased their efforts to mine]{.mark} and
acquire physical [gold]{.mark} if, or perhaps [when, the dollar
collapses]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [OPEC kingpin [Saudi Arabia is at the
crux of the petrodollar]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since a 1974 agreement
between U.S. President Richard Nixon and Saudi King Faisal, Saudi Arabia
has accepted payments for nearly all of its oil exports in dollars.
However, [as China imports more and more oil from countries across the
world, the idea of [having to purchase]{.mark} that same [oil in dollars
has become]{.mark} increasingly [irritable to
Beijing]{.mark}.]{.underline} In recent years, **[[China has sought
to]{.mark} ratchet up the [pressure]{.mark} on [Saudi]{.mark} Arabia
[over the]{.mark} form of [currency]{.mark} in [which]{.mark} their [oil
trade is]{.mark} [conducted]{.mark}, with Riyadh now enjoying less and
less oil purchases from Beijing]{.underline}**. When asked what it could
mean for the dollar should the oil market move oil trade out of the U.S.
currency and into the yuan, Weinberg said the world's transaction
currency would suffer "lesser demand for U.S. securities across the
board." "[Moving oil trade out of dollars into yuan will take right now
between \$600 billion and \$800 billion worth of transactions out of the
dollar... (That) means a stronger demand for things in China, whether
it's securities or whether it's goods and services. It is a growth plus
for China and that's why they want this to happen."]{.underline}

#### If Saudi wanted to diversify its currency by **[15%, it would erode the primacy of the dollar and force massive structural changes to foreign policy initiatives and it causes economic downturn.]{.underline}**

After 1971, the US economy entered into a long period of instability.
During this period there were a number of recessions, including a mini
recession in 1971, a deeper and larger recession from 1973--75, a period
of hyperinflation from 1979--80, a severe recession in 1981--82, a
real-estate bubble and stock market panic in 1987, and a deep recession
in 1992-- 93. Nine of the 22 years from 1971--93 were 'economically
troubled', together with the years in-between reflecting uneasy
transitions from one crisis to another. [The one persistent effort that
marks this volatile period was a forceful attempt by the US to restore
the role of the dollar as the universal reserve currency by linking the
dollar to yet another commodity: petroleum]{.underline}, thus creating
the petrodollar. **[[The petrodollar]{.mark} system [provided]{.mark}
some strength and [prestige to the US currency]{.mark}, and shifted the
focus of global politics to the oil-rich Middle East.]{.underline}** A
petrodollar is a dollar earned by a country through the sale of oil. The
term 'petrodollar system' derives from the way the diplomatic relations
between the US and Saudi Arabia linked the sale of oil to the dollar
through a series of negotiations and agreements concluded during
1972--74 period. As a result, [[the US]{.mark} government reached a
series of agreements with Saudi Arabia, known as the US-Saudi Arabian
Joint Economic Commission, to [provide]{.mark} technical support and
[military assistance]{.mark} to the power of the House of Saud [in
exchange for accepting only US dollars for its oil]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Department of the Treasury 2002). **[[This]{.mark} understanding, much
of it never publicised and little understood by the public, [provided
the Saudi ruling]{.mark} family the [security]{.mark} it craved in a
dangerous neighbourhood while assuring the US a reliable and important
ally in the Middle East]{.underline}** (Kaiser and Ottaway 2002).
[[Saudi Arabia]{.mark} was and [remains]{.mark} the largest oil producer
in the world and **[the leader of]{.mark} the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, [OPEC]{.mark}**]{.underline} (US Energy Information
Administration 2014 a). It is also the only member of the cartel that
does not have an allotted production quota, which makes it the 'swing
producer', meaning that it can increase or decrease oil production to
bring about an oil drought or glut in the world market. [Saudi Arabia
hence practically determines[,]{.mark} or has the means to determine,
oil prices. Soon after the agreement with the Saudi government, an OPEC
agreement consented to this, and since then all oil has been traded in
US dollars]{.underline} (Klare 2004: 40--45). Now why would this matter
so much? [**[Oil is]{.mark} not just [the most important commodity
traded internationally]{.mark}**. It is the key industrial mineral; it
has a central role in modern economies, without which no modern economy
works. If you don't have oil, you have to buy it, and if you need to buy
it on the world markets, you commonly have to purchase it with
dollars]{.underline}. This provides an essential base for the dollar's
reserve currency status: other countries buy and hold large reserves of
dollars (in the same way they buy and hold gold) because they cannot
purchase oil without dollars. **[This made the 'petrodollar' a de facto
replacement for the pre-1971 gold-dollar standard, guaranteeing a
constant demand for dollars whose value was linked to oil through the
OPEC pricing standards]{.underline}**. In 2002, a former US ambassador
to Saudi Arabia told a committee of the US Congress: 'One of the major
things the Saudis have historically done, in part out of friendship with
the US, is to insist that oil continues to be priced in dollars.
Therefore [the US Treasury can print money and buy oil, which is an
advantage no other country has']{.underline} (Nixon 2003). **[This
system of [the US dollar acting as]{.mark} global reserve [currency in
oil trade keeps the demand for the dollar 'artificially'
high.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[This allows the US to print dollars
at]{.mark} next to [no cost to subsidise increased military
spending]{.mark} and consumer spending on imports.** As long as the US
has no significant challengers and the other states have faith in the US
dollar, the system operates well]{.underline} (Spiro 1999: 121). **[This
has been the situation and the crucial basis for the US economic
hegemony since the 1970s]{.underline}**. Needless to say, this system
also empowers the US administration to compellingly control the world
oil market. The dominance of [the dollar is not simply the result of the
size of the US economy; it is also the result of two other things:
global politics and finance]{.underline}. In this scheme, **[the
industrialised countries had to purchase oil, either from OPEC or from
one of the smaller oil producers, but they could conduct these purchases
only by pricing and buying oil in dollars, thus restoring the dollar's
role as a required reserve currency]{.underline}** (see among others
Gokay and Whitman 2004: 64--65). So long as OPEC oil was priced in US
dollars, the US government benefited from a double loan. The first
portion of the loan was for oil. The government could print dollars to
pay for oil, and the US economy did not have to generate goods and
services in exchange for the oil since OPEC used the dollars for all
traded goods and services. Obviously, the strategy could not work if
dollars were not a means of exchange for oil. The second part of the
loan was from all other economies that had to pay dollars for oil but
could not print currency. Those [economies had to trade their goods and
services for dollars in order to pay their oil imports to OPEC
producers]{.underline} (Spiro 1999: 121). In this situation, dollars
rapidly accumulated in foreign banks, particularly those serving
petroleum-exporting countries. This petrodollar overhang created an
additional financial issue: unlike Western Europe and Japan, most of the
oil-exporting countries had limited possibilities for domestic
development and consumption, and therefore they could not invest most of
this money. Many of these economies in the region are structured
strictly on 'rents' from oil, which provide most of the export earnings
and state revenues. Despite their extensive oil wealth, the oil-rich
countries of the Middle East have failed to develop a diversified
economic base. All finished manufactured goods as well as financial and
hightech services are imported and controlled by Western multinationals.
Adam Smith once commented that the Tartars and other Asian nations may
be rich precisely because they are resource poor. 'In the Middle East,
... the political process is that the rulers do not tax citizens or
businesses, but hand out selective privileges, financed by oil revenues,
against loyalty and support from a largely parasitic private sector'
(Noreng 2006: 87--88). Some efforts were made to redistribute oil
revenues across the populations by subsidising housing, education, and
health care. But mostly, oil money was used to support excessive
consumption, corruption, and gross waste. The Nixon Administration
responded 'creatively' by coaxing these countries into purchasing US
Treasury bills and bonds, which performed as yet another subsidy for the
US economy. This has, since that time, been the primary strategy for the
US administration to deal with its colossal trade deficits by keeping
domestic interest rates low (Kaiser and Ottaway 2002). **[The cash
balances of oil exporters soon found their way into the US-controlled
international banking system, and these petrodollars went straight back
into the US economy at zero currency risk]{.underline}**. Some of this
cash was recycled as loans, with some interest of course, to
oil-importing countries, mainly by US-controlled international financial
institutions For a long time everything worked smoothly. But the end of
the Soviet-controlled socialist bloc economies in Eastern Europe and the
emergence of a new single Europe and the European Monetary Union in the
early 1990s began to present an entirely new challenge to the global
position of the US economy. In particular with the creation of the euro
in late 1999, a totally new factor was added to the global financial
system. Within a relatively short period, the euro has emerged as a
realistic alternative, establishing itself as the second most
influential currency in the world's financial markets[[.]{.mark} If a
considerable part of petroleum trade were to use euros instead of
dollars, many more countries would have to hold a greater part of their
currency reserves in euros]{.underline}. According to a June 2003 HSBC
report, **[[even a]{.mark} moderate [shift]{.mark}, as small as [15 per
cent, away from dollars]{.mark}, or a change in the flow, [would create
considerable changes]{.mark}]{.underline}** (HSBC 2003). The dollar
would then have to openly battle with the euro for global trade and
financial markets. [[Not only would Europe not require dollars]{.mark}
anymore, [but also Japan,]{.mark} which imports more than 80 per cent of
its oil from the Middle East, would have to switch most of its dollar
assets to euros. **The US, too, currently being the world's second
largest oil importer after China, would have to retain a significant
amount of euro reserves. [This would be catastrophic for US]{.mark}
efforts at [monetary management: the]{.mark} US [administration would be
compelled to]{.mark} drastically [change its]{.mark} current tax, debt,
and [trade policies]{.mark}, all of [which are]{.mark} relentlessly
[volatile]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [Today, US citizens spend \$700
billion (US) a year more than they generate, so they require a reserve
of an additional \$700 billion.]{.underline} This means that, on
average, each US citizen benefits from \$3,000 more imported products
per year than he/she earns (US National Debt Clock 2006). [They acquire
this large amount of money from the Central Banks of China, Japan and
European countries, thanks to the US dollar's status as global reserve
currency and the simple fact that all other central banks hold dollar
reserves]{.underline}. China is the principal holder of US currency
reserves with \$853.7 billion, and Japan is the second biggest with over
\$850 billion in dollar assets (Bloomberg 2006; Mainichi News 2006). So
the rest of the world are producers and sellers: Japan, China, India,
Brazil, the EU, and the rest. The rest of the world invests, produces,
and exports to the US. They lend more and more to the US. This situation
is, however, considered unstable and very risky by experts. The
increasing instability of the US economy is emphasised by a major 2005
report from the IMF (IMF 2006 which pointed out that the US economy is
increasingly being maintained by what it described as 'unprecedented
borrowing' from foreigners. The report went on to describe the US
deficit as unmanageable and risky in the long term.

Make no mistake: [**if President Trump ordered the U.S. military to
attack [Iran]{.mark}**, it would do so and, were that to happen, **there
can be little doubt about the ultimate negative outcome for Iran. Its
moth-eaten [military]{.mark} machine [is]{.mark} simply [no match for
the American]{.mark} [one]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Almost 18 years after
Washington's war on terror was launched, however, there can be little
doubt that any [U.S. assault on Iran would also stir up yet more chaos
across the region, displace more people, create more refugees, and leave
behind more dead civilians, more ruined cities and infrastructure, and
more angry souls ready to join the next terror group to pop
up]{.underline}. It would surely lead to another quagmire set of ongoing
conflicts for American soldiers. Think: Iraq and Afghanistan, exactly
the type of no-win scenarios that many top Pentagon officials now seek
to flee. But don't chalk such feelings up only to a reluctance to get
bogged down in yet one more war-on-terror quagmire. These days, **[[the
Pentagon is]{.mark} also increasingly [obsessed with preparations
for]{.mark} another type of war in another locale entirely: [a
high-intensity conflict with China]{.mark}]{.underline}**, possibly in
the South China Sea. After years of slogging it out with guerrillas and
jihadists across the Greater Middle East, [the U.S. military is
increasingly keen on preparing to combat "peer" competitors China and
Russia, countries that pose what's called a "multi-domain" challenge to
the United States.]{.underline} This new outlook is only bolstered by a
belief that **[[America's]{.mark} never-ending [war on terror]{.mark}
has severely [depleted its military]{.mark}, something obvious to both
[Chinese and Russian leaders]{.mark} who [have taken advantage]{.mark}
of Washington's extended preoccupation with counterterrorism [to
modernize their forces]{.mark} and equip them with advanced
weaponry]{.underline}**. For [the United States]{.underline} to remain a
paramount power --- so Pentagon thinking now goes --- [it must turn away
from counterterrorism and focus instead on developing the wherewithal to
decisively defeat its great-power rivals]{.underline}. This outlook was
made crystal clear by then-Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis in testimony
before the Senate Armed Services Committee in April 2018. "[The negative
impact on military readiness resulting from the longest continuous
period of combat in our nation's history \[has\] created an
overstretched and under-resourced military]{.underline}," he insisted.
Our rivals, he added, used those same years to invest in military
capabilities meant to significantly erode America's advantage in
advanced technology. **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, he assured the
senators, **[is "modernizing its conventional military forces to a
degree that [will challenge U.S. military
superiority]{.mark}."]{.underline}** In response, the United States had
but one choice: to reorient its own forces for great-power competition.
"[Long-term strategic competition --- not terrorism --- is now the
primary focus of U.S. national security.]{.underline}" This outlook was,
in fact, already enshrined in the National Defense Strategy of the
United States of America, [[the Pentagon's]{.mark} overarching blueprint
governing all aspects of military planning.]{.underline} [**Its [\$750
billion budget]{.mark} proposal for fiscal year 2020**, unveiled on
March 12th, **[was]{.mark} said to be fully [aligned with this
approach]{.mark}**.]{.underline} "The operations and capabilities
supported by this budget will strongly position the U.S. military for
great-power competition for decades to come," acting Secretary of
Defense Shanahan said at the time. In fact, in that budget proposal, the
Pentagon made sharp distinctions between the types of wars it sought to
leave behind and those it sees in its future. "[Deterring or defeating
great-power aggression is a fundamentally different challenge than the
regional conflicts involving rogue states and violent extremist
organizations we faced over the last 25 years]{.underline}," it noted.
"The FY 2020 Budget is a major milestone in meeting this challenge," by
financing the more capable force America needs "to compete, deter, and
win in any high-end potential fight of the future." **[If such [a
high-intensity war]{.mark} were to break out, Pentagon leaders suggest,
it [would]{.mark} be likely to [take place]{.mark} simultaneously [in
every domain of combat]{.mark} --- air, sea, ground, space, and
cyberspace --- and would feature the widespread utilization of emerging
technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and
cyberwarfare]{.underline}**. To prepare for such multi-domain
engagements, [the 2020 budget includes \$58 billion for advanced
aircraft, \$35 billion for new warships --- the biggest shipbuilding
request in more than 20 years --- along with \$14 billion for space
systems, \$10 billion for cyberwar, \$4.6 billion for AI and autonomous
systems, and \$2.6 billion for hypersonic weapons.]{.underline} You can
safely assume, moreover, that **[each of those amounts will be increased
in the years to come.]{.underline}** Planning for such a future,
Pentagon officials envision clashes first erupting on the peripheries of
China and/or Russia, only to later extend to their heartland expanses
(but not, of course, America's). As those countries already possess
robust defensive capabilities, [any conflict would undoubtedly quickly
involve the use of front-line air and naval forces to breach their
defensive systems --- which means the acquisition and deployment of
advanced stealth aircraft, autonomous weapons, hypersonic cruise
missiles, and other sophisticated weaponry. In Pentagon-speak, these are
called anti-access/area-defense (A2/AD) systems]{.underline}. As it
proceeds down this path, the Department of Defense is already
considering future war scenarios. [**[A clash with Russian
forces]{.mark} in the Baltic region of the former Soviet Union
[is]{.mark}, for instance, considered [a distinct possibility]{.mark}**.
So the **U.S. and allied NATO countries have been bolstering their
forces** in that very region and seeking weaponry suitable for attacks
on Russian defenses along that country's western border.]{.underline}
Still, the Pentagon's main focus is a rising China, the power believed
to pose the greatest threat to America's long-term strategic interests.
"[China's historically unprecedented economic development has enabled an
impressive military buildup that could soon challenge the U.S. across
almost all domains]{.underline}," Admiral Harry Harris Jr., commander of
the U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM) and now the U.S. ambassador to South
Korea, typically testified in March 2018. "**[China's ongoing military
modernization is a core element of China's stated strategy to supplant
the U.S. as the security partner of choice for countries in the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}**." As Harris made clear, [any conflict with
China would probably first erupt in the waters off its eastern coastline
and would involve an intense U.S. drive to destroy China's A2/AD
capabilities]{.underline}, rendering that country's vast interior
essentially defenseless. Harris's successor, Admiral Philip Davidson, as
commander of what is now known as the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, or
USINDOPACOM, described such a scenario this way in testimony before
Congress in February 2019: "[Our adversaries are fielding advanced
anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) systems, advanced aircraft, ships,
space, and cyber capabilities that threaten the U.S. ability to project
power and influence into the region]{.underline}." To overcome such
capabilities, he added, the [U.S. must develop and deploy an array of
attack systems for "long-range strike\[s\]" along with "advanced missile
defense systems capable of detecting, tracking, and engaging advanced
air, cruise, ballistic, and hypersonic threats from all
azimuths]{.underline}." If you read through the testimony of both
commanders, you'll soon grasp one thing: that **[[the U.S.
military]{.mark} --- or at least the Navy and Air Force --- [are focused
on a]{.mark} future [war-scape in which]{.mark} [American forces are no
longer focused on]{.mark} terrorism or [the Middle East, but on
employing]{.mark} their most sophisticated [weaponry to
overpower]{.mark} the [modernized forces of China (or Russia)]{.mark} in
a relatively brief spasm of violence]{.underline}**, lasting just days
or weeks. **[These would be wars in which the mastery of technology, not
counterinsurgency or nation building]{.underline}**, would --- so, at
least, top military officials believe --- prove the decisive factor.
Such Pentagon scenarios essentially assume that a conflict with China
would initially erupt in the waters of the South China Sea or in the
East China Sea near Japan and Taiwan. U.S. strategists have considered
these two maritime areas America's "first line of defense" in the
Pacific since Admiral George Dewey defeated the Spanish fleet in 1898
and the U.S. seized the Philippines. Today, USINDOPACOM remains the most
powerful force in the region with major bases in Japan, Okinawa, and
South Korea. [China, however, has visibly been working to erode American
regional dominance somewhat by modernizing its navy and installing along
its coastlines short- and medium-range ballistic missiles, presumably
aimed at those U.S. bases]{.underline}. By far its most obvious threat
to U.S. dominance in the region, however, has been its occupation and
militarization of tiny islands in the South China Sea, a busy maritime
thoroughfare bounded by China and Vietnam on one side, Indonesia and the
Philippines on the other. In recent years, the Chinese have used sand
dredged from the ocean bottom to expand some of those islets, then
setting up military facilities on them, including airstrips, radar
systems, and communications gear. In 2015, China's President Xi Jinping
promised President Obama that his country wouldn't take such action, but
satellite imagery clearly shows that it has done so. [While not yet
heavily fortified, those islets provide Beijing with a platform from
which to potentially foil U.S. efforts to further project its power in
the region]{.underline}. "These bases appear to be forward military
outposts, built for the military, garrisoned by military forces, and
designed to project Chinese military power and capability across the
breadth of China's disputed South China Sea claims," Admiral Harris
testified in 2018. "**[China has built a massive infrastructure
specifically --- and solely --- to support advanced military
capabilities that can deploy to the bases on short
notice.]{.underline}**" To be clear, [U.S. officials have never declared
that the Chinese must vacate those islets or even remove their military
facilities from them]{.underline}. However, for some time now, [they've
been making obvious their displeasure over the buildup in the South
China Sea]{.underline}. In May 2018, for instance, Secretary of Defense
Mattis disinvited the Chinese navy from the biennial "Rim of the
Pacific" exercises, the world's largest multinational naval maneuvers,
saying that "there are consequences" for that country's failure to abide
by Xi's 2015 promise to Obama. "That's a relatively small consequence,"
he added. "I believe there are much larger consequences in the future."
What those consequences might be, Mattis never said. But there is no
doubt that the U.S. military has given careful thought to a possible
clash in those waters and has contingency plans in place to attack and
destroy all the Chinese facilities there. American warships regularly
sail provocatively within a few miles of those militarized islands in
what are termed "freedom of navigation operations," or FRONOPS, while
U.S. air and naval forces periodically conduct large-scale military
exercises in the region. Such activities are, of course, closely
monitored by the Chinese. Sometimes, they even attempt to impede FRONOPS
operations, leading more than once to near-collisions. In May 2018,
Admiral Davidson caused consternation at the Pentagon by declaring,
"[China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all
scenarios short of war with the United States]{.underline}" --- a
comment presumably intended as a wake-up call, but also hinting at the
kinds of conflicts U.S. strategists foresee arising in the future.
**[[The U.S. Navy sends]{.mark} a missile-[armed destroyer]{.mark} close
[to]{.mark} one of those [Chinese-occupied islands]{.mark} just about
[every few weeks]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It's what the U.S. high command
likes to call "showing the flag" or demonstrating America's resolve to
remain a dominant power in that distant region (though were the Chinese
to do something similar off the U.S. West Coast it would be considered
the scandal of the century and a provocation beyond compare). **[Just
about every time it happens, [the Chinese]{.mark} authorities warn off
those ships or [send]{.mark} out their own [vessels to]{.mark} shadow
and [harass them]{.mark}.]{.underline}** On May 6th, for example, [the
U.S. Navy sent two of its guided-missile destroyers, the USS Preble and
the USS Chung Hoon, on a FRONOPS mission near some of those islands,
**provoking a fierce complaint from Chinese officials**]{.underline}.
This deadly game of chicken could, of course, go on for years without
shots being fired or a major crisis erupting. The odds of avoiding such
an incident are bound to drop over time, especially as, in the age of
Trump, U.S.-China tensions over other matters --- including trade,
technology, and human rights --- continue to grow[. [American military
leaders have]{.underline}]{.mark} [clearly [been strategizing
about]{.mark} the possibility of [a conflict erupting]{.mark} in this
area for some time and, if Admiral Davidson's remark is any indication,
would respond to such a possibility with considerably more relish than
most of them do to a possible war with Iran.]{.underline} Yes, they view
Iran as a menace in the Middle East and no doubt would like to see the
demise of that country's clerical regime. Yes, some Army commanders like
General Kenneth McKenzie, head of the U.S. Central Command, still show a
certain John Bolton-style relish for such a conflict. **[But
[Iran]{.mark} today --- weakened by years of isolation and trade
sanctions --- [poses no unmanageable threat to America's]{.mark} core
strategic [interest]{.mark}s and, thanks in part to the nuclear deal
negotiated by the Obama administration]{.underline}**, possesses no
nuclear weapons. Still, can there be any doubt that a war with Iran
would turn into a messy quagmire, as in Iraq after the invasion of 2003,
with guerrilla uprisings, increased terrorism, and widespread chaos
spreading through the region --- exactly the kind of "forever wars" much
of the U.S. military (unlike John Bolton) would prefer to leave behind?
[How this will all play out obviously can't be foreseen, but if the U.S.
does not go to war with Iran, Pentagon reluctance may play a significant
role in that decision. **This does not mean, however, that Americans
would be free of the prospect of major bloodshed in the future.** The
very next U.S. naval patrol in the South China Sea, or the one after
that, could provide the spark for a major blowup of a very different

**[[The response to the 2008 economic crisis]{.mark} has [relied]{.mark}
far too much [on monetary stimulus]{.mark}, in the form of quantitative
easing and near-zero]{.underline}** (or even negative) [interest rates,
[and included]{.mark} far **[too little structural
reform]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This means that **[[the next crisis
could]{.mark} come soon -- and [pave the way for]{.mark} a large-scale
[military conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The next economic crisis is
closer than you think. But what [you should really worry about is what
comes after: in the current social, political, and technological
landscape, **[a prolonged economic crisis]{.mark}, combined [with
rising]{.mark} [income inequality, could]{.mark} well [escalate
into]{.mark} a major [global military conflict]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
The 2008-09 global financial crisis almost bankrupted governments and
caused systemic collapse. [Policymakers managed to pull the global
economy back from the brink, using massive monetary stimulus, including
quantitative easing and near-zero]{.underline} (or even negative)
[interest rates]{.underline}. But **[monetary stimulus]{.underline}** is
like an adrenaline shot to jump-start an arrested heart; it **[can
revive the patient, but it does nothing to cure the
disease.]{.underline}** Treating a sick economy requires structural
reforms, which can cover everything from financial and labor markets to
tax systems, fertility patterns, and education policies. Policymakers
have utterly failed to pursue such reforms, despite promising to do so.
Instead, they have remained preoccupied with politics. From Italy to
Germany, forming and sustaining governments now seems to take more time
than actual governing. And Greece, for example, has relied on money from
international creditors to keep its head (barely) above water, rather
than genuinely reforming its pension system or improving its business
environment. [The [lack of structural reform has]{.mark} meant that the
[unprecedented]{.mark} excess [liquidity that central banks injected
into]{.mark} their [economies was not allocated]{.mark} to its most
efficient uses]{.underline}. Instead, it raised global asset prices to
levels even higher than those prevailing before 2008. In the United
States, [**[housing prices]{.mark} [are]{.mark} now
[8% [higher](https://www.zillow.com/home-values/) than]{.mark} they were
at [the]{.mark} peak of the [property bubble in]{.mark} 20[06]{.mark},
according to the property website Zillow.** [The
price-to-earnings]{.mark} (CAPE) [ratio]{.mark}, which measures whether
stock-market prices are within a reasonable range, [is
now [higher](http://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/) than it was]{.mark} both
[in 2008 and]{.mark} at the start of the Great Depression in
[1929]{.mark}.]{.underline} As monetary tightening reveals the
vulnerabilities in the real economy, **[[the collapse]{.mark} of
asset-price bubbles [will trigger another economic crisis]{.mark} -- one
that could be even [more severe than the last]{.mark}, because we have
built up a tolerance to our strongest macroeconomic
medications]{.underline}**. [A decade of regular adrenaline shots, in
the form of ultra-low interest rates and unconventional monetary
policies, has severely depleted their power to stabilize and stimulate
the economy]{.underline}. If history is any guide, the consequences of
this mistake could extend far beyond the economy. According to Harvard's
Benjamin Friedman, **[[prolonged
[periods]{.mark}](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/bfriedman/files/the_moral_consequences_of_economic_growth_0.pdf)[ of
economic distress have been characterized]{.mark} also [by]{.mark}
public [antipathy toward minority groups or foreign countries]{.mark} --
[attitudes that can]{.mark} help to [fuel]{.mark} unrest, terrorism, or
even [war.]{.mark}]{.underline}** For example, [during the Great
Depression, US President Herbert Hoover signed the 1930 Smoot-Hawley
Tariff Act]{.underline}, intended to protect American workers and
farmers from foreign competition. [In the subsequent five years, global
trade shrank by two-thirds. Within a decade, World War II had
begun.]{.underline} To be sure, WWII, like World War I, was caused by a
multitude of factors; there is no standard path to war. **[But there is
reason to believe that high levels of inequality can play a significant
role in stoking conflict.]{.underline}** According
to [research](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674430006) by
the economist Thomas Piketty, a spike in income inequality is often
followed by a great crisis. [Income inequality then declines for a
while, before rising again, until a new peak -- and a new
disaster.]{.underline} Though causality has yet to be proven, given the
limited number of data points, **[[this]{.mark} correlation [should not
be taken lightly]{.mark}, especially [with wealth]{.mark} and income
[inequality at historically high levels]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This is
all the more worrying in view of the numerous **[other factors stoking
social unrest and diplomatic tension, including technological
disruption, [a record-breaking migration crisis, anxiety]{.mark} over
globalization, political [polarization, and]{.mark} rising
[nationalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [All are symptoms of failed
policies that could turn out to be trigger [points for a future
crisis]{.mark}.]{.underline} Voters have good reason to be frustrated,
but the emotionally appealing populists to whom they are increasingly
giving their support are offering ill-advised solutions that will only
make matters worse. For example, [despite the world's unprecedented
interconnectedness, **multilateralism is increasingly being eschewed**,
as countries -- most notably, Donald Trump's US -- pursue unilateral,
isolationist policies.]{.underline} Meanwhile, [proxy wars are raging in
Syria and Yemen**. Against this background, we must take seriously the
possibility that [the next economic crisis]{.mark} could [lead
to]{.mark} a large-scale [military confrontation.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
By
the [logic](http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Clash-of-Civilizations-and-the-Remaking-of-World-Order/Samuel-P-Huntington/9781451628975) of
the political scientist Samuel Huntington , considering such a scenario
could help us avoid it, because it would force us to take action. In
this case, the key will be for policymakers to pursue the structural
reforms that they have long promised, while replacing finger-pointing
and antagonism with a sensible and respectful global dialogue. The
alternative may well be global conflagration.

### 2NC -- Financial Decline Bad

#### **[Financial decline forces US withdrawal from foreign initiatives on the world stage---this creates a massive power vacuum.]{.underline}**

**[Freidberg and Schoefeld 08]{.underline}** (Aaron, a professor of
politics and international relations at Princeton University\'s Woodrow
Wilson School, Gabriel, senior editor of Commentary, is a visiting
scholar at the Witherspoon Institute in Princeton, "The Dangers of a

One immediate implication of the crisis that began on Wall Street and
spread across the world is that the primary instruments of U.S. foreign
policy will be crimped. The next president will face an entirely new and
adverse fiscal position. Estimates of this year\'s federal budget
deficit already show that it has jumped \$237 billion from last year, to
\$407 billion. With families and businesses hurting, there will be calls
for various and expensive domestic relief programs. [In the face of this
onrushing river of red ink, both Barack Obama and John McCain have been
reluctant to lay out what portions of their programmatic wish list they
might defer or delete]{.underline}. Only Joe Biden has suggested a
possible reduction \-- foreign aid. This would be one of the few popular
cuts, but in budgetary terms it is a mere grain of sand. Still, Sen.
Biden\'s comment hints at where we may be headed: toward a major
reduction in America\'s world role, and perhaps even a new era of
financially-induced isolationism. **[[Pressures to cut defense spending,
and]{.mark} to [dodge the cost of]{.mark} waging two [wars,]{.mark}
already intense before this crisis, [are likely to
mount]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Despite the success of the surge, the war
in Iraq remains deeply unpopular. [Precipitous withdrawal \-- attractive
to a sizable swath of the electorate before the financial implosion \--
might well become even more popular with annual war bills running in the
hundreds of billions.]{.underline} Protectionist sentiments are sure to
grow stronger as jobs disappear in the coming slowdown. Even before our
current woes, calls to save jobs by restricting imports had begun to
gather support among many Democrats and some Republicans. In a prolonged
recession, gale-force winds of protectionism will blow. [**[Then there
are]{.mark} the dolorous [consequences of a potential collapse of the
world\'s financial architecture]{.mark}. For decades now, [Americans
have enjoyed]{.mark} the advantages of [being at the center of that
system]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} The worldwide use of the dollar, and the
stability of our economy, among other things, made it easier for us to
run huge budget deficits, as we counted on foreigners to pick up the tab
by buying dollar-denominated assets as a safe haven]{.underline}. Will
this be possible in the future? Meanwhile, [traditional foreign-policy
challenges are multiplying]{.underline}. **[The threat from al Qaeda and
Islamic terrorist affiliates has not been extinguished. [Iran and North
Korea are continuing]{.mark} [on their bellicose paths]{.mark}, while
Pakistan and Afghanistan are progressing smartly down the road to
chaos]{.underline}**. Russia\'s new militancy and China\'s seemingly
relentless rise also give cause for concern. **[[If America now tries to
pull back from the world stage, it will leave a dangerous power
vacuum]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The stabilizing effects of our presence
in Asia, our continuing commitment to Europe, and our position as
defender of last resort for Middle East energy sources and supply lines
could all be placed at risk. In such a scenario there are shades of the
1930s, when global trade and finance ground nearly to a halt, the
peaceful democracies failed to cooperate, and aggressive powers led by
the remorseless fanatics who rose up on the crest of economic disaster
exploited their divisions. [Today we run the risk that rogue states may
choose to become ever more reckless with their nuclear toys, just at our
moment of maximum vulnerability.]{.underline} [The aftershocks of the
financial crisis will almost certainly rock our principal strategic
competitors even harder than they will rock us. The dramatic free fall
of the Russian stock market has demonstrated the fragility of a state
whose economic performance hinges on high oil prices, now driven down by
the global slowdown. China is perhaps even more fragile, its economic
growth depending heavily on foreign investment and access to foreign
markets]{.underline}. Both will now be constricted, inflicting economic
pain and perhaps even sparking unrest in a country where political
legitimacy rests on progress in the long march to prosperity. **[None of
this is good news if the authoritarian leaders of these countries seek
to divert attention from internal travails with external
adventures]{.underline}**. As for our democratic friends, the present
crisis comes when many European nations are struggling to deal with
decades of anemic growth, sclerotic governance and an impending
demographic crisis. Despite its past dynamism, Japan faces similar
challenges. India is still in the early stages of its emergence as a
world economic and geopolitical power. What does this all mean?
[**[There is no substitute for America on the world stage]{.mark}.** The
choice we have before us is between the potentially disastrous effects
of disengagement and the stiff price tag of continued American
leadership. Are we up for the task? The American economy has
historically demonstrated remarkable resilience**. Our market-oriented
ideology, entrepreneurial culture, flexible institutions and favorable
demographic profile should serve us well in whatever trials lie
ahead.**]{.underline} The American people, too, have shown reserves of
resolve when properly led. But experience after the Cold War era \--
poorly articulated and executed policies, divisive domestic debates and
rising anti-Americanism in at least some parts of the world \-- appear
to have left these reserves diminished. A recent survey by the Chicago
Council on World Affairs found that 36% of respondents agreed that the
U.S. should \"stay out of world affairs,\" the highest number recorded
since this question was first asked in 1947. [The economic crisis could
be the straw that breaks the camel\'s back. In the past, the American
political process has managed to yield up remarkable leaders when they
were most needed]{.underline}. As voters go to the polls in the shadow
of an impending world crisis, they need to ask themselves which
candidate \-- based upon intellect, courage, past experience and
personal testing \-- is most likely to rise to an occasion as grave as
the one we now face.

### AT: Dollar Collapse Good

#### US dollar hegemony over oil and gold transactions ensures that it remains the global reserve currency. Dollar Hegemony enables the US to cut off payment systems to Russia and North Korea. If the dollar was no longer the global reserve currency, trade would decrease, and the US would suffer from financial decline.

Trump is retreating from the American chief executive's traditional role
as Leader of the Free World. Yet the U.S. dollar remains, as the saying
goes, almighty. "[American exceptionalism has never been this
stark]{.underline}," Ruchir Sharma, head of emerging markets and chief
global strategist for Morgan Stanley Investment Management, said at a
Council on Foreign Relations symposium on Sept. 24.By the latest tally
of the European Central Bank, [**America's currency makes up two-thirds
of international debt and a like share of global reserve holdings**.
[Oil and gold are priced in dollars]{.mark}, not euros or
yen.]{.underline} **[When Somali pirates hold up ships at sea, it's
dollars they demand]{.underline}**. **[And [threats to be cut off from
the dollar-based global payments system strike terror into]{.mark} the
likes of [Iran, North Korea, and Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It's no
exaggeration to say that the **[dollar's [primacy is]{.mark} at least
[as valuable]{.mark} to the U.S. as a couple of [aircraft carrier strike
groups]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Now the dollar paradox shows signs of
unraveling. **[Political leaders who once accepted the dollar's
hegemony, grudgingly or otherwise, are pushing back.]{.underline}**
Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, said in
September that it's
"[absurd](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/soteu2018-speech_en_0.pdf)"
that [European companies buy European planes in the American currency
instead of their own]{.underline}. In March, [China challenged the
dollar's dominance in the global energy markets with a [yuan-denominated
crude oil futures
contract](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-28/the-world-s-newly-minted-oil-future-is-still-finding-its-feet)]{.underline}.
Russia [slashed its dollar
holdings](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-13/russia-to-cut-u-s-securities-holdings-more-as-sanctions-loom) this
year, claiming (inaccurately) that the greenback is "becoming a risky
instrument in international settlements." And **[French Finance Minister
Bruno Le Maire told reporters in August that he wants financing
instruments that are "totally independent" of the U.S.,
saying]{.underline}**, "I want Europe to be a sovereign continent, [not
a
vassal](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-27/eu-looking-to-sidestep-u-s-sanctions-with-payments-system-plan)."
This disturbance in the force isn't good news for the U.S. The dollar's
preeminent role in global finance is an "exorbitant privilege," as
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, then France's finance minister, said in 1965.
If the dollar loses its central role---to be sure, not an imminent
threat---[the U.S. will be more vulnerable when there's a loss of
investor confidence**. The Federal Reserve might**]{.underline} even
have to do what other nations do when global investors panic: [jack up
interest rates to painful levels to keep speculative money from flowing
out.]{.underline} As it is now, **[when trouble breaks out[, investors
flood into U.S. markets seeking refuge]{.mark}, oddly enough even [when
the U.S.]{.mark} itself [is the]{.mark} source of the [problem]{.mark},
as it was in last decade's global financial crisis]{.underline}**. A
slippage in the dollar could also be viewed as a symptom of U.S.
isolationism. "[[In a]{.mark} hypothetical [scenario where the U.S.
withdraws from the world]{.mark}," damage to [the dollar's standing
could cause average U.S. interest rates to rise by 0.8 percentage
point]{.mark}, according to a December paper by Barry Eichengreen of the
University of California at Berkeley and two researchers from the
European Central Bank]{.underline}. While any serious erosion of the
dollar's status would take years, the U.S. can't take its preeminence
for granted, says Eichengreen: "Being the incumbent international
currency is an advantage, but it's not the only thing that matters." The
most immediate risk to the dollar is that the U.S. will overplay its
hand on financial sanctions, particularly those against Iran and
countries that do business with Iran. In May the Trump administration
withdrew from the 2015 deal that eased sanctions on Iran in exchange for
that country's promise to stop certain nuclear activities. The U.S. will
reimpose sanctions on Nov. 4 and is successfully pressuring companies
outside the U.S. not to do business with Tehran. **[[European
companies]{.mark} and banks [could be]{.mark} [punished by the U.S. if
they]{.mark} inadvertently [transact with]{.mark} sanctioned Iranian
groups such as [the I]{.mark}slamic [R]{.mark}evolutionary
[G]{.mark}uard [C]{.mark}orps.]{.underline}** European leaders, in
response to what they perceive as an infringement on their sovereignty,
are openly working on a payments system that would enable their
companies to do business with Iran without getting snagged by the U.S.
Treasury Department and its powerful Office of Foreign Assets Control.
One idea is to set up a government-funded organization, which would be
less vulnerable to U.S. actions than a private company or bank, to
arrange exchanges of Iranian oil for products from Europe and possibly
Russia and China as well. French officials say the transactions might be
structured as barter to avoid involving banks. "We cannot accept as
Europeans that others, even our closest allies and friends, determine
who we can do business with," Federica Mogherini, the European Union's
foreign policy chief, said at the Bloomberg Global Business Forum on
Sept. 26. [The Europeans' progress has been slow, so there won't be
anything ready in time to alleviate the sanctions taking effect in
November]{.underline}, says Carsten Brzeski, a former European
Commission official who's now chief economist of ING-DiBa, the German
branch of the Dutch banking company ING Group. Indeed, U.S. national
security adviser [J]{.underline}ohn Bolton dismissed the European plan
from the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly meeting in
late September, calling the European Union "strong on rhetoric and weak
on follow-through." He needled, "So we will be watching the development
of this structure that doesn't exist yet and has no target date to be
created." Still, Bolton may come to regret his dismissiveness. Even if
Europe's workaround isn't ready for prime time, it needs to be viewed as
part of the widespread dissatisfaction with the dollar's dominance. That
dissatisfaction is only mounting. In 2016, Jacob Lew, then-President
Obama's secretary of the Treasury, warned in a speech at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace that "overuse of sanctions could
undermine our leadership position within the global economy and the
effectiveness of our sanctions themselves." [Broad support is best, he
said. He added that the U.S. "must be prepared to offer sanctions relief
if we want countries to change their behavior."]{.underline} Trump's
reinstitution of sanctions against the wishes of the coalition partners,
without clear evidence that Iran has meaningfully broken its
commitments, appears to violate both of Lew's principles. (A spokeswoman
said Lew wasn't available for comment.) Even Mark Dubowitz, chief
executive officer of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which
favors action against Iran, says that "there's always risk of overuse of
a single instrument. \... You need covert action, military, a regional
strategy, political and information warfare." **[The best thing [the
dollar]{.mark} has going for it is that its [challengers are
weak]{.mark}. [The euro]{.mark} represents a monetary union, but
[there's]{.mark} no [central taxing]{.mark} and spending
[authority]{.mark}. Italy's recent woes are only the latest challenge to
the euro zone's durability.]{.underline}** China is another pretender to
the throne. But [[China's undemocratic leadership is wary of]{.mark}
[the openness to global trade]{.mark} and capital flows that having a
widely used currency requires.]{.underline} In a December interview with
Quartz news site, Eichengreen said, "[Every true global currency in the
history of the world has been the currency of a democracy or a political
republic, as far back as the republican city-states of
Venice]{.underline}, Florence, and Genoa [in the 14th and 15th
centuries]{.underline}." On the other hand, the U.S. is hardly alluring
these days. "When does the rest of the world turn to the U.S. and say,
'What have you done for me lately?' " Beth Ann Bovino, chief U.S.
economist of S&P Global Ratings, asked on Sept. 30 at the annual meeting
of the National Association for Business Economics in Boston. The
biggest long-term challenge to the dollar's standing is what economists
term the Triffin dilemma. Belgian-American economist Robert Triffin
observed [in 1959 that for the U.S. to supply dollars to the rest of the
world, it must run trade deficits. Trading partners stash the dollars
they earn from exports in their reserve accounts instead of spending
them on American goods and services.]{.underline} Eventually, **[though,
the chronic U.S. trade deficits undermine confidence in the
dollar.]{.underline}** This is what forced President Richard Nixon to
abandon the dollar's convertibility to gold in 1971. Harvard economist
Carmen Reinhart cited the dollar's Triffin dilemma at the Boston
business economists' meeting. "Now you say, well, that's not a problem,
our debt is not backed by gold," she said. "[But [our debt]{.mark}, and
anybody's debt, [is]{.mark} ultimately [backed by]{.mark} the goods and
[services]{.mark} that an economy produces.]{.underline}" And, she
noted, "our share of world \[gross domestic product\] is shrinking."
When Giscard d'Estaing coined the phrase "exorbitant privilege," he was
referring to the fact that [the U.S. gets what amounts to a permanent,
interest-free loan from the rest of the world when dollars are held
outside the U.S.]{.underline} As Eichengreen points out, **[[it
costs]{.mark} only [a few cents for]{.mark} the U.S. Bureau of Engraving
and Printing [to produce a \$100 bill, but other countries]{.mark} have
[to pony up \$100 worth of]{.mark} actual [goods and services to obtain
one]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Dollars that foreigners willingly accept
and trade among themselves are like little green IOUs to the rest of the
world.]{.underline} They allow Americans collectively to consume more
than they produce---to live beyond their means. [The downside to
America's privilege is that the foreign demand for dollars raises the
exchange rate, making American products less competitive in world
markets.]{.underline} Especially in slack times, American workers can be
thrown out of work when the U.S. imports products that could have been
made domestically. And the accumulation of dollars outside the U.S.
represents a transfer of wealth to other countries. **[[If other
countries]{.mark} suddenly decide to [use their dollars to buy American
goods and services]{.mark}, the [U.S.]{.mark} will suddenly have plenty
of work to do---but [consumers will]{.mark} have to [switch]{.mark} from
living beyond their means [to living beneath their
means]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

### AT: Dollar Heg Not Key

This article contends that the [[dollar as the global]{.mark} reserve
[currency has been crucial to]{.mark} the operations of [US
hegemony]{.mark} during the post-World War II period]{.underline}. To
investigate this issue, the theoretical perspective of World-Systems
Analysis expounded by Immanuel Wallerstein (2011) is employed. The
article also draws upon the theoretical work of Henry C.K. Liu who
developed the term "US dollar hegemony" (Liu 2002). In this article, we
argue that [[US planners]{.mark} from the Council on Foreign Relations
(CFR) in conjunction with State Department officials [pursued a
deliberate plan to make the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [a
global hegemon]{.mark}ic power]{.underline} (Shoup and Minter 1977)
**[[and the dollar was the central currency]{.mark} of that
hegemony]{.underline}** (Engdahl 2008, 213). We demonstrate how the
dollar evolved into a petro-currency through Nixon's Saudi decision of
1973. The dollar was placed on the trajectory that it would follow for
decades and became the source of conflict against the United States by
its geo-political competitors (Durden 2014). We conclude by arguing that
newly emerging strategic competitors to US hegemony such as China,
Russia and Iran are growing dissatisfied with the current oil trading
arrangements. We do not argue that any of these nations are remotely in
contention to replace the United States as world hegemon. However, we
suggest that **[[a significant blow could be dealt to]{.mark} the
ability of the United States to maintain its [hegemonic status should
oil trading be carried]{.mark} out [in currencies other than the
dollar]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Koenig 2015). If this were to occur to a
large enough extent, [the ability of the United States to exercise its
foreign policy would be severely curtailed]{.underline} (National
Intelligence Council \[NIC\] 2012). **[[It would]{.mark} also
[demonstrate the]{.mark} critical [importance of the US dollar
in]{.mark} the exercise of [US hegemony]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In this
article, **[we would like to move the dollar to the forefront of debate
in understating how US hegemony in the post World War II period is
constructed and maintained and its critical importance in a hegemonic US
global agenda.]{.underline}** The post-World War II era represented a
radical paradigm shift in US foreign policy. This policy shift was
defined by the "Grand Area" concept developed by the CFR in conjunction
with planners from the US State Department. This programme saw the
United States pursue a global hegemonic project (Shoup 1975). [This
pursuit was economic in nature; it would require binding together
disparate regions of the world into a financial system that would centre
upon, and serve the interests of, the US economy]{.underline} (Shoup and
Minter 1977). US imperialism was the result of extensive planning on the
part of the US government (Panitch and Gindin 2012, 72). The Bretton
Woods Conference held in 1944 was the forum where a US-centric world
system was instituted. The systems, institutions and arrangements that
facilitate US hegemony were established at the Bretton Woods Conference.
[[The most critical of]{.mark} these components for [the functioning of
US hegemony were]{.mark} the creation of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the World Bank, [the adoption of the US dollar as the global
reserve currency]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} and the "pegging" of the
US dollar to the gold standard (Vasudevan 2008, 35). The Bretton Woods
Conference instituted a world system where the US dollar was at the
centre of the global economy; the value of a nation's currency was
determined in relation to the US dollar, and "most international
transactions were denominated in dollars" (Engdahl 2008). The Grand Area
strategy pursued by the United States was intended to defend US national
interests in the aftermath of World War II. Those national interests
were, in fact, US elite and corporate interests (Shoup and Minter 1977).
After World War II, [the United States designed a liberal international
system in which it would be the primary beneficiary]{.underline}
(Mastanduno 2009). Economics and security became inseparably linked for
the United States, and the dollar was the core of this new paradigm.
According to Mastanduno, as the global reserve currency, the US dollar
became the "lynchpin" of Trans-Atlantic and TransPacific trade: [[This
critical role for the dollar]{.mark} granted a well-understood privilege
to U.S. policymakers. As long as other governments proved willing to
hold dollars, [U.S. external deficits could be financed]{.mark}
essentially [by printing money and lending it abroad]{.mark}, [enabling

term]{.mark}]{.underline}. (Mastanduno 2009, 130) This arrangement was
based on using the US dollar as the primary trading currency. US
planners understood the power that this would confer on the United
States. At the time of the Bretton Woods Conference, economic
considerations were paramount in determining the United States' role in
the post-war world. Warruined European nations were in dire need of
liquidity (Mastanduno 2009). [**Its establishment as the global reserve
currency provided the US dollar with a stability of demand during a
period when many European nations were in a dire economic position**.
The British Empire was seen as an obstacle to US hegemony.]{.underline}
Britain had major oil interests in the Middle East and Venezuela (Hudson
2003, 119). These interests, particularly Middle East oil, were
identified by the Council of Foreign Relations as a "stupendous source
of strategic power" (Kolko and Kolko 1972). It became the intention of
US planners to gain control of these interests and secure them for the
United States (Notter 1949). [The Council for Foreign Relations viewed
the Second World War and its aftermath as an opportunity for the United
States to replace Britain as the dominant global hegemon: With the entry
of the United States into World War Two, American planners were
virtually unanimous in the belief that the nation should claim a
dominant position in the post war world.]{.underline} As usual, however,
the leaders of the Council on Foreign Relations were stating this view
most clearly. Council President Norman H. Davis now chairmen of the
Department of State's security subcommittee of the advisory on post war
foreign policy, asserted in early May, 1942 that it was probable "the
British empire as it existed in the past will never reappear and that
the United States may have to take its place." (Hooker 1956, 333)

**[The [U.S.-Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [alliance is built on]{.mark} decades
of [security cooperation and]{.mark} strong business ties dominated by
[U.S.]{.mark} [interests in]{.mark} Saudi [oil]{.mark}]{.underline}.**
The relationship has survived severe challenges, including the 1973 oil
embargo and 9/11 attacks, in which fifteen of the nineteen passenger jet
hijackers were Saudi citizens. Successive U.S. administrations have held
that Saudi Arabia is a critical strategic partner in the region.
[[Relations between the]{.mark} two [countries have grown]{.mark}
especially warm [under]{.mark} U.S. President Donald J. [Trump]{.mark}
and Saudi de facto leader Mohammed bin Salman, who was elevated to crown
prince in mid-2017**. [Both have ramped up efforts to counter
Iran]{.mark}, Saudi Arabia's main regional rival**]{.underline}**.**
However, recent actions under the crown prince's leadership,
particularly the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, are posing new
strains on the alliance, as many members of the U.S. [Congress have
called for punishing Riyadh and reassessing the
relationship]{.underline}. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, founded in 1932,
traces its roots to [an
alliance](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/saud/cron/) between
the Saud family and descendants of religious cleric Sheikh Mohammed Ibn
Abdul Wahab, who espoused conservative Sunni jurisprudence. This pact
has endured for centuries, influencing the country's domestic and
foreign policy. [Saudi authorities enforce religious restrictions,
denying women rights they enjoy in Western democracies, and the
government promotes its interpretation of sharia, or Islamic law, by
funding religious schools around the world. Though it has recently
lifted some restrictions, including a ban on women drivers, **human
rights groups say rights abuses persist**]{.underline}. The United
States, first through its oil industry and then through government
contacts, established a relationship with Saudi Arabia's founder, King
Abdulaziz Ibn Saud, and his successors that evolved into a close
alliance despite a stark clash in values. U.S. businesses have been
involved in Saudi Arabia's oil industry [since
1933](http://www.cfr.org/world/timeline-oil-dependence-us-foreign-policy/p24322),
when the Standard Oil Company of California (now Chevron) won a
sixty-year concession to explore eastern Saudi Arabia. It made its first
oil discovery there in 1938. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt
recognized the oil discovery's strategic nature. His meeting with King
Abdulaziz aboard the USS Quincy in Egypt in 1945 solidified the
relationship. Saudi Arabia was officially neutral during World War II
but allowed the Allies to use its airspace. Standard Oil and the Texas
Oil Company (Texaco) formed a partnership in Saudi Arabia in 1936 and
together founded the Arabian American Oil Company, or Aramco, in 1944;
the consortium later expanded to include what would later become Exxon
and Mobil, helping Saudi Arabia become one of the world's largest oil
exporters. (The United States is expected to [soon
overtake](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-26/citi-says-u-s-may-become-world-s-top-oil-exporter-next-year)Saudi
Arabia as the top exporter.) Saudi Arabia gradually bought out foreign
shareholders, and since 1980, the company, now known as Saudi Aramco,
has been wholly government owned. U.S. companies Chevron, Dow Chemical,
and ExxonMobil still have refining and petrochemical ventures in Saudi
Arabia. Saudi Arabia's proven crude oil reserves are among the largest
in the world. Its oil production averaged 10.7 million barrels a day, of
which 7.43 million were exported, in September 2018, according to
the [Joint Organizations Data Initiative](https://www.jodidata.org/),
which compiles information about global energy production.
[**[The]{.mark} scale of the [kingdom's oil output and]{.mark} its
[founding role in]{.mark} the oil cartel Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries ([OPEC) gives it]{.mark} [great influence]{.mark}
over energy markets;** it has played a "central banker" role, adjusting
its oil production levels to stabilize global oil prices**.**
**[Protecting Saudi]{.mark} Arabia and other Persian Gulf producers [has
been a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy]{.mark} for
decades.**]{.underline} OPEC has tried to steer oil markets since its
formation in 1961, often directly affecting U.S. consumers. In 1973,
Saudi Arabia embargoed sales of its oil to the United States in response
to [U.S. support for the Israeli
military](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1969-1976/oil-embargo) in
its war against Arab states. In the 1980s, Saudi Arabia led OPEC in a
price war to knock out competition from non-OPEC producers; the
kingdom's ability to quickly boost production caused oil prices to
plummet by more than 60 percent over a six-month period. The drop
severely hurt the Soviet Union's oil revenues in the years before its
collapse. Balancing the oil market, or [making the price
"fair"](https://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Saudi-Arabias-Oil-Policy-in-Uncertain-Times-A-Shift-in-Paradigm.pdf) \[PDF\]
for both producers and consumers, is the stated goal of Riyadh's energy
policy. However, more recently, the kingdom has manipulated oil prices
to try to keep [U.S.
shale](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hydraulic-fracturing-fracking) from
becoming a viable competitor in the global market. In 2014, facing a
glut in supply, Saudi Arabia and OPEC once again faced calls to curb
production. But the Saudi oil minister at the time, Ali al-Naimi,
persuaded OPEC to [keep
pumping](https://uk.reuters.com/article/saudi-oil/update-2-saudi-arabia-expects-oil-price-to-stabilise-idUKL5N0W62G820150304) to
force high-cost producers---those exploiting shale, oil sands, and
deep-sea resources---to reduce their output. [Another Saudi aim was to
undercut Iran's economy. **The policy also put heightened pressure on
Russia**, which was sanctioned by the United States and others after its
invasion of Crimea.]{.underline} Oil prices subsequently fell to record
lows of around \$35 a barrel, and in a late 2016 reversal, Saudi Arabia,
along with Russia, [pressed OPEC
members](http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21711088-oil-prices-surge-saudi-arabia-and-iran-sign-deal-opecs-meeting) and
other states to collectively curb their production. The six-month
agreement, which went into effect in January 2017, was largely
honored, [defying some analysts'
expectations](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-opec-oil-exclusive-idUSKBN17D1YF).
OPEC continued to reduce its collective output, and by fall 2018
prices [topped \$80 a
barrel](https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/oil-price).
However, following U.S. pressure, Saudi Arabia [boosted its
supply](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-opec-survey/opec-oil-output-boost-in-september-limited-by-iran-losses-reuters-survey-idUSKCN1MB2FE) toward
the end of the year amid declines in exports from Venezuela, suffering
an economic crisis, and Iran, hit with new U.S. sanctions. Providing
security for the oil-rich Persian Gulf region has been a U.S. priority
since World War II. U.S. companies were responsible for much of the oil
produced in the region through the 1970s, and even as Saudi Arabia
nationalized its oil industry at the end of that decade, it remained an
important U.S. partner in the Cold War. The United States had for many
years relied on Iran, under the rule of the shah, as part of a "twin
pillar" policy of stabilizing the region. However, Iran's 1979 Islamic
Revolution upended that approach, leaving Saudi Arabia as the primary
U.S. ally in the region for nearly four decades. U.S.-Saudi military
cooperation peaked in the first Gulf War, when in 1991 a U.S.-led
coalition expelled Iraqi forces from Kuwait. More than half a million
U.S. troops flooded into the region, with [many based in Saudi
Arabia](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/saudi-arabia-withdrawl-us-forces).
[The presence of U.S. soldiers drew ire from Saudi conservatives and
reinforced arguments that the elite was too accommodating to Western and
non-Muslim interests]{.underline}. The United States, Saudi Arabia, and
Pakistan supported the resistance to the Soviet occupation of
Afghanistan, which lasted from 1979 to 1989. Cash and weapons flowed to
the Afghan jihad, which attracted thousands of Sunni Muslims from the
Middle East and North Africa. Saudi-born Osama bin Laden, son of the
founder of the largest construction company in Saudi Arabia, joined the
jihad in the 1980s and recruited Saudi fighters. Bin Laden returned to
Saudi Arabia in 1990 with close links to the kingdom's intelligence
officials. But his opposition to U.S. troops in the Middle East put him
at odds with the royal family, which welcomed the U.S. forces that had
driven Saddam Hussein's army out of Kuwait. Bin Laden, who would found
al-Qaeda, left the country by early 1992 and was stripped of citizenship
in 1994. From his new base in Afghanistan, where he was protected by the
new Taliban leadership, bin Laden issued a fatwa against "[Americans
occupying the land of the two holy
mosques](http://fas.org/irp/crs/RS21973.pdf)" \[PDF\], referring to the
Saudi cities of Mecca and Medina, in 1996. Following the 9/11 attacks, a
wave of popular anti-Saudi sentiment in the United States [damaged
relations between the
countries](http://www.cfr.org/saudi-arabia/united-states-saudi-arabia-relationship-threatened-misconceptions/p6982?cid=nlc-press_release-press_note--link11-20150123&sp_mid=47889754&sp_rid=cm1jbWFob25AY2ZyLm9yZwS2).
The George W. Bush administration's [omission of twenty-eight
pages](http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/twenty-eight-pages) from
the [9/11 Commission
Report](http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/) fueled speculation that
the U.S. government was covering up evidence that Saudi officials were
complicit in the attacks. In 2016, the U.S. Congress passed legislation,
over President Barack Obama's veto and Saudi threats of [economic
retaliation](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/16/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-warns-ofeconomic-fallout-if-congress-passes-9-11-bill.html),
that allows the families of 9/11 victims to sue the kingdom, an
exception to the principle of sovereign immunity. Some legal scholars,
however, say that plaintiffs would [likely be
unable](https://www.cfr.org/interview/what-911-lawsuits-bill-will-do) to
collect on any damages. [[Saudi Arabia is the top destination for U.S.
arms]{.mark}, with U.S. defense sales to the kingdom totaling close
to [\$90
billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/10/15/why-trump-wants-keep-lockheed-boeing-others-business-with-saudi-arabia/) since

During his May 2017 trip to the kingdom, Trump signed a series of arms
deals expected to total some \$350 billion over a decade. According to
the arms researcher SIPRI, Saudi Arabia's total arms imports
were [almost eighteen times
greater](http://armstrade.sipri.org/armstrade/html/export_values.php) \[PDF\]
