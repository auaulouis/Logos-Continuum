### 1AC\-\--Terrorism i/l

#### A regime change destroys Iran's ability to safeguard its uranium arsenals, allowing opportunist terrorists to steal and create crude bombs

The idea of terrorists accomplishing such a thing is, unfortunately, not
out of the question; [it is far easier to make a crude, unsafe,
unreliable nuclear explosive that might fit in the back of a truck than
it is to make a safe, reliable weapon of known yield that can be
delivered by missile or combat aircraft. **Numerous [government
studies]{.mark}** have [conclude]{.mark}d that [it is]{.mark}
[plausible]{.mark} that [a sophisticated terrorist group could make a
crude bomb if they got]{.mark} the [needed nuclear
material]{.mark}.]{.underline} And in the last quarter century, [[there
have been]{.mark} some **[20 seizures]{.mark}** [of stolen,
weapons-usable nuclear material]{.mark}]{.underline}, and at least two
[[terrorist groups have made]{.mark} significant [efforts to acquire
nuc]{.mark}lear bomb[s]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Terrorist use of an actual nuclear bomb is a low-probability
event---[but the immensity of the consequences means that [**even a
small chance is enough** to justify an **intensive effort to reduce the
risk**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Fortunately, since the early 1990s,
countries around the world have significantly reduced the danger---but
it remains very real, and there is more to do to ensure this nightmare
never becomes reality.

Brighter than a thousand suns. Imagine a crude terrorist nuclear
bomb---containing a chunk of highly enriched uranium just under the size
of a regulation bowling ball, or a much smaller chunk of
plutonium---suddenly detonating inside a delivery van parked in the
heart of a major city. Such [[a terrorist bomb would]{.mark} release as
much as 10 kilotons of explosive energy, or the equivalent of 10,000
tons of conventional explosives, a volume of explosives large enough to
fill all the cars of a mile-long train]{.underline}. In a millionth of a
second, [all of that energy would be released inside that small ball of
nuclear material, **[creat]{.mark}ing [temperatures]{.mark} and
pressures [as high as]{.mark} those at the center of [the
sun]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [That]{.underline} furious [energy would
explode outward, releasing its energy in]{.underline} three main ways: a
powerful blast wave; intense heat; [[and]{.underline} **[deadly
radiation]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

#### Terrorism causes extinction

Matthew **Bunn** **and Roth 18**, Nickolas, research associate with the
Project on Managing the Atom at Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center
for Science and International Affairs, Matthew Bunn is professor of
practice and co-principal investigator with the Project on Managing the
Atom, 9/28/17, "The effects of a single terrorist nuclear bomb",
<https://thebulletin.org/2017/09/the-effects-of-a-single-terrorist-nuclear-bomb/>

And [what standards of **international order** and law would still
hold]{.underline} sway? [[The country attacked might]{.mark} well
**[lash out militarily]{.mark}**]{.underline} at whatever countries it
thought might bear a portion of responsibility. (A terrifying
description of the kinds of discussions that might occur appeared in
Brian Jenkins' book, Will Terrorists Go Nuclear?) [[With the nuclear
threshold]{.mark} already [crossed]{.mark}]{.underline} in this
scenario---at least by terrorists---[[it is conceivable]{.mark} that
[some of]{.mark} the resulting [conflicts might **escalate to nuclear
use**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} [[International politics could
become]{.mark}]{.underline} more **[brutish]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} [**[violent,]{.underline}** [with powerful states
taking **unilateral action**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [by
force]{.underline} if necessary, in an effort to ensure their security.
[[After 9/11, the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[led]{.mark} the [invasions of
two]{.mark} sovereign [nations]{.mark}]{.underline}, in wars that have
since cost hundreds of thousands of lives and trillions of dollars,
while plunging a region into chaos. [Would the reaction after a far more
devastating nuclear attack be any less?]{.underline}

In particular, the idea that each state can decide for itself how much
security to provide for nuclear weapons and their essential ingredients
would likely be seen as totally unacceptable following such an attack.
[Powerful states would likely demand]{.underline} that [others surrender
their nuclear material or accept foreign troops]{.underline} (or other
imposed security measures) to guard it.

[That could well be the first step toward a more **profound
transformation of the international system**]{.underline}. After such a
catastrophe, [[major powers may feel compelled to]{.mark} more freely
[engage in **preventive war**]{.mark}]{.underline}, seizing territories
they worry might otherwise be terrorist safe havens, and taking other
steps they see as brutal but necessary to preserve their security. For
this reason, [foreign policy analyst Stephen Krasner has
argued]{.underline} that ["conventional [rules]{.mark} of sovereignty
[would be abandoned overnight]{.mark}."]{.underline} [[Confidence
in]{.underline}]{.mark} both the national security institutions of the
country attacked and [[international institutions]{.mark} such
as]{.underline} the [International Atomic Energy Agency and the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[N]{.underline}**ations, which had so
manifestly failed to prevent the devastation, [[might
erode]{.underline}]{.mark}. The effect on nuclear weapons policies is
hard to predict: One can imagine new nuclear terror driving a new push
for nuclear disarmament, but one could also imagine states feeling more
certain than ever before that they needed nuclear weapons.

### Dollar Heg Resiliency

#### Dollar heg is resilient

Simon **Constable 18**, fellow at the John Hopkins Institute for Applied
Economics, Global Health and the Study of Business Enterprise, 5-23-19,
"Why China's Yuan Is No Imminent Threat To The Dollar," Forbes,
https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonconstable/2018/05/23/no-china-isnt-going-to-unseat-the-might-dollar-anytime-soon/#67321a497d65

\"[[There is]{.mark} simply [not enough **liquidity** in]{.mark} all the
[other currencies combined to switch]{.mark} away [from the
dollar]{.mark}]{.underline},\" says Jeff Christian, veteran financial
markets expert and founder of New York-based commodities consulting firm
CPM Group.

Consider these financial markets statistics.

The debt market is dominated by securities denominated in dollars. More
than half (51%) of the liabilities are in dollars with 28% in euros. The
remainder of the total comprises all other currencies combined,
according to data from the Bank of International Settlements. [The
Chinese yuan doesn\'t get an individual mention]{.underline}.

The market for interest rate derivatives is dominated by the dollar.
[[Around **70% of the transaction volume is in dollars**]{.mark}, with
all other currencies combined making up the remainder, according to BIS
data]{.underline}.

The foreign exchange market is dominated by the dollar with almost half
of all transactions (44%) by volume involving the dollar, according to
the latest (2016) triennial survey from the BIS. The data shows 88% but
the total of all currencies comes to 200%.

[The dollar\'s dominance in all these subsector markets means there is
more liquidity and hence more **efficiency** in each of the markets.
That efficiency means there is little financial reason to look elsewhere
for loans or derivatives.]{.underline}

If nothing else, the mantra of business has long been, \"if it ain\'t
broke don\'t fix it.\" [[Chief financial officers know]{.mark} that [the
dollar market is the]{.mark} biggest and [most efficient]{.mark}, so
that is what they use. Self-fulling maybe, but that is a fact of life.
There\'s little reason for them to change.]{.underline}

Big Shock Needed

[That inertia in the habits of business means that it takes an awful lot
to unseat the doiminant reserve currency.]{.underline}

\"[[It would take a **seismic-sized shock** to unseat the U.S.
dollar]{.underline}]{.mark},\" says Robert Wright, professor of
political economy at Augustana University in Sioux Falls Sout Dakota,
and also an economic historian.

We don\'t have a lot of history of currency regimes chnaging. But [there
is some evidence from when the British pound sterling got unseated by
the U.S. dollar.]{.underline}

[Even [during the late 19th century, the U.S. economy was]{.mark}
clearly [rivaling]{.mark} that of [the U]{.mark}nited [K]{.mark}ingdom
(not including its colonies and possessions.) **However**, size wasn;t
enough. [It took until 1944 for the U.S. dollar to unseat the
pound]{.mark}, and [it did]{.mark} indeed [involve]{.mark} some
[cataclysmic shocks.]{.mark}]{.underline}

To begin with, there was WWI of 1914-1918 in which Britain lost up to
100,000 men a month. [Not only was a huge portion of a generation of men
killed, but there was a vast financial cost to the country
also]{.underline}. Following that, in the 1920s, an attempt was made by
Britain to peg its currency back to gold at the same rate it had been
before the war. The result was massive industrial action. [Then came the
Great Depression and after that WWII with all the associated destruction
and death.]{.underline}

In short, [there was a lot of economic and geopolitical upheaval
necessary in order to unseat the pound from its role of King of
currencies]{.underline}.

I have written similar commentary in the past, but somehow some people
just aren\'t getting the message. **[The dollar will be with us for long
time yet]{.underline}**.

### No Dollar Heg !

#### Being reserve currency means nothing

Paul **Krugman 15**, Professor of Economics and International Affairs at
the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at
Princeton University, Nobel Priz in Economics, 8-12-2015,
\"International Money Mania,\"
https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/12/international-money-mania/?module=BlogPost-Title&version=Blog%20Main&contentCollection=Opinion&action=Click&pgtype=Blogs®ion=Body&gwh=8C073A16CF4D6C311FC9EA94BEF0BA2D&gwt=pay&assetType=opinion

I mentioned one of Charlie Kindleberger's aphorisms earlier today, about
taking the first bite of the cherry; another was that "Anyone who spends
too much time thinking about international money goes a bit mad." What
he meant by that is that [there's something about the subject of reserve
currencies that makes people want to believe that it's a really
important issue --- that the dollar's special role is an important part
of American power]{.underline}. So you have spectacles like John Kerry
and Barack Obama declaring that [one big risk from rejecting an Iran
deal (which I very much support) would be a threat to the role of the
dollar. Um, no --- it wouldn't, and anyway **who cares**?]{.underline}

What does America gain from the dollar's special role? You often find
people declaring that it's only thanks to the special role of the dollar
that the United States has been able to run persistent trade deficits
--- you see, people have to take our money. But [even a quick glance at
international balance of payments statistics shows you that [countries
whose currencies play no special role]{.mark} whatever [are perfectly
capable of running deficits over a long time; all that matters
is]{.mark} that [they be perceived as **reliable debtors who offer good
investment**]{.mark} opportunities.]{.underline} Look at Australia,
which is a much more consistent large-deficit country than we are:

\[GRAPH\]

So [what are the advantages of owning a reserve currency?
You]{.underline} do [get to borrow in your own currency --- but then, so
do others;]{.underline} again, [it's about **reliability** rather than a
special role]{.underline}. [There's [nothing in the data
suggesting]{.mark} that [you can borrow more cheaply than other safe
borrowers.]{.mark}]{.underline}

What you're left with, basically, is seigniorage: the fact that some
people outside your country hold your currency, which means that in
effect America gets a zero-interest loan corresponding to the stash of
dollar bills --- or, mainly \$100 bills --- held in the hoards of tax
evaders, drug dealers, and other friends around the world. In normal
times this privilege is worth something like \$20-30 billion a year;
that's not a tiny number, but it's only a small fraction of one percent
of GDP.

The point is that [[while reserve-currency status may have political
symbolism]{.mark} attached, [it's]{.mark} essentially
[irrelevant]{.mark} as an economic goal --- [and]{.mark} **definitely
[not worth distorting policy to]{.mark} [achieve]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
Someone needs to tell the Chinese, you shall not crucify this country on
a cross of SDRs.

#### Dollar heg doesn't impact US heg\-\--transition absorbs the shock

**Stratfor 16**, The World's Leading Geopolitical Intelligence Platform,
5-2-2016, "The Decline of the Dollar Is Not the Decline of the United
States,"
https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/decline-dollar-not-decline-united-states

That risk will continue to drive other countries to protect themselves
financially, limited though their options may be. In truth, the only
powers that could realistically challenge the United States\' economic
dominance are China and Europe. [But neither can offer a distinct
alternative to U.S. financial hegemony, a view that Stratfor shares with
ETM Analytics]{.underline}. [To supplant the dollar as the global
reserve currency, the rest of the world would have to undertake the long
and onerous process of building a consensus. But [the **dollar would
still**]{.mark} **[be]{.mark} an [instrumental]{.mark}**, if diminished,
[currency]{.mark} in whatever system that process created]{.underline}.
In other words, [[the **weakening of the dollar**]{.mark} **in global
finance [would not]{.mark} be synonymous with a [weaken]{.mark}ing of
[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates\' status [as a global
superpower]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tate[s\' strength]{.mark} as a superpower
[rests on]{.mark} several pillars, including its [geography]{.mark},
technological prowess, culture of innovation, financial and economic
[flexibility]{.mark}, relative political cohesiveness [and military
dominance]{.mark}]{.underline}. While any single pillar might weaken at
one time, collectively, they give the United States a well-rounded
foundation and lend it far more flexibility in dealing with its problems
than any other nation.

At the heart of U.S. power is its geography and the strategic depth that
this geography provides. The nation\'s vast internal infrastructure is
buoyed by a robust national highway system, as well as the globe\'s
largest rail system and longest internal waterway network. Moreover, the
United States is self-sufficient in almost all major industrial and
agricultural commodities, with the exception of petroleum. Even then,
[[it is the world\'s largest petroleum producer]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The United States has no strategic threats on its immediate borders,
with even further depth supported, for now, by its military and
aerospace power. This geographical productivity and external security
allow it to take a hands-off economic approach unmatched by most other
economies. [Its free economic environment cultivates a strong
entrepreneurial culture and allows venture capital platforms to
flourish; gives it leadership roles in innovation and research and
development in all areas of technology and academia; enables a robust
financial center; and creates a flexible labor market]{.underline}. In
total, [[U.S. economic power is far]{.mark} [from]{.mark} just [a
consequence of the dollar\'s hegemony]{.mark} in global finance and
makes it a magnet for capital and investment accumulation.]{.underline}
