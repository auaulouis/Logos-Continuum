#### USMCA will pass --negotiations between Trump and Pelosi will secure the votes

**Lucht 7/1** -- Gene, public affairs editor for Iowa Farmer Today, a
publication of AgUpdate, "Grassley expects to move on USMCA before
recess", AgUpdate, 7/1/19,
<https://www.agupdate.com/iowafarmertoday/news/state-and-regional/grassley-expects-to-move-on-usmca-before-recess/article_8389f610-9c3c-11e9-b096-f33f7b4e3daa.html>

[The process is taking time, but Sen. Charles
[Grassley]{.mark}]{.underline}, R-Iowa, [[said he]{.mark} still [expects
to see Congress approve the]{.mark}]{.underline} United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement ([[USMCA]{.underline}) [before lawmakers
leave]{.underline}]{.mark} [town [for]{.mark} their annual August
[recess.]{.mark}]{.underline} The agreement is an update of the North
American Free Trade Agreement that became law in 1994. Many rural
lawmakers and agricultural leaders pushed to keep the United States from
pulling out of NAFTA before and are pushing for Congress to approve the
USMCA now. But there has been some opposition in both parties. [Grassley
said]{.underline} the biggest roadblock now is with Democrats in the
House, but he said [Speaker of the House Nancy **[Pelosi is working with
Trump]{.mark}** administration officials [to address concerns]{.mark}
some [lawmakers have]{.mark} with the USMCA.]{.underline} Most of those
concerns are in regards to items such as environmental or labor issues
or with enforcement. [Pelosi has the challenge of [satisfying]{.mark} a
large freshman class of [Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s in the House]{.mark} who
were not in Congress during the USMCA negotiations and who may not be
familiar with the details of NAFTA. That [simply takes time, negotiation
and education]{.mark}]{.underline}, Grassley said. **[He said [Pelosi
"wants to get to yes]{.mark}" on USMCA, and he expects that will
happen]{.underline}**. ["USMCA is a top priority of mine," Grassley told
reporters]{.underline} during a June 25 conference call.

"SEVEN MYTHS THAT SUSTAIN THE GLOBAL ARMS TRADE ECONOMICS AND THE POWER
OF POLITICS" 2017 //dmr

[[One of the most commonly stated reasons for arms transactions is
that]{.mark}]{.underline} they are supposed to
[[generate]{.underline}]{.mark} a whole series of [[economic
benefits]{.underline}.]{.mark} Indeed, [[in some cases, arms sales are
justified entirely for their economic benefit]{.underline}]{.mark}
(itself a questionable proposition we'll see in the next chapter),
rather than their importance for national defense. In certain countries
these [supposed **[economic benefits become the means by which arms
producers place pressure on politicians]{.mark}** to support
strategically questionable projects: **[no politician wants to attack a
project that may employ large numbers of their constituents]{.mark}**,
even if the money could theoretically be more efficiently spent
elsewhere]{.underline}. Combined, [these]{.underline} two [reasons can
be decisive in securing support for sometimes clearly absurd
expenditure, as evidenced in the case of the F-35.]{.underline} The F-35
[Boondoggle]{.underline} Coming in at an estimated total cost of 1.5tr
to produce and maintain over its lifetime, [the Lockheed Martin F-35
stealth fighter is the most expensive weapons program in
history]{.underline}.1 In reality, the cost may even exceed this
gargantuan sum: [every year that the F-35 has been in production the
cost has gone up due to technical problems and engineering
concerns]{.underline}. For this enormous outlay, the US will receive
2,457 stealth fighter-bombers that will be operated by a number of its
arms of service (the air force and the navy in particular).2 [[The
problems with the F-35]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[are
legion]{.mark}. Beyond spiraling costs, there seems to be little
technical advantage provided by the aircraft compared to those already
in production. Since its inception]{.underline} in the late 1980s, [its
design has been modified again and again to include capabilities that
often contradict each other. The aircraft is supposedly light and
stealthy, **[yet it]{.mark}** also needs to be able to carry a massive
payload of bombs and sophisticated weapons]{.underline}. It is intended
to be used as both a bomber and an air-to- air fighter, yet its current
design means that pilots cannot look behind them to see what is coming
or going? The end result is a jet that has not only been constantly
delayed (with nearly all of its testing still ahead of it), but one that
fails to offer a better strategic solution than aircraft currently in
production. The noted military commentator Winslow Wheeler, who has
advised both Republican and Democratic senators in his long and studied
career, has summarized the performance thus: A virtual flying piano, the
F-35 lacks the F-i6's agility in the air-to-air mode and the F-15E s
range and payload in the bombing mode, and it can't even begin to
compare to the A-10 at low-altitude close air support for troops engaged
in combat. Worse yet, it wont be able to get into the air as often to
perform any mission---or just as importantly, to train pilots---because
its complexity prolongs maintenance and limits availability. The
aircraft most like the F-35S, the F-aa, was able to get into the air on
average for only 15 hours for a month in 2010 when it was fully
operational.4 **[The F-35 [has two things going for it: an enormous
budget to lobby decision makers and a ready list of all the Jobs that it
has created]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Lockheed Martin's splashy website
is quick to emphasize the latter, promising that the F-35 delivers tens
of thousands of high-paying, high quality jobs to American]{.underline}
workers across the country. Below this is a usefule map showing how the
F-35 contributes to your state's economy. In total, [Lockheed Martin
claims that the F-35 program sustains 129, 000 direct and indirect jobs
across forty-five US states]{.underline}. Unfortunately, it appears
these figures may be a considerable over-estimate. According to leading
commentator Bill Hartung, the total number of jobs that could
realistically be expected to be created---using standard accounting
methods---is in the region of 50,000 to 60,000. And the claim that
forty-five states will receive economic benefits ignores that this is
massively skewed by region: the top five states will account for nearly
70% of all jobs sustained by the project. A total of eleven
states---Iowa, South Dakota, Montana, I West Virginia, Delaware,
Nebraska, North Dakota, Alaska, I Hawaii, Louisiana and Wyoming---will
each house less than I a dozen F-35 jobs.8 I[f these figures are less
than impressive, have a look at Lockheed's budget for
influencing]{.underline}. According to David Axe, an investigative
blogger who works closely with a Swiss-based security policy group
Ofliziere, **[[Lockheed Martin spends at least \$15m a year on its
lobbying efforts, and is able to direct considerable campaign
contributions to decisive players]{.underline}]{.mark}**.[9 [Four of the
most important F-35 contractors]{.underline}]{.mark}---Lockheed Martin,
BAE Systems, Northrop Grumman and United Technologies---[have [made
campaign contributions totaling \$11m in]{.mark}]{.underline} 2011/2012
and [2013/[2014]{.mark}]{.underline}.10 [Of these donations, a
substantial portion were directed towards members of the F-35 caucus, a
thirty-nine-member group within Congress that has long supported the jet
project.]{.underline} The biggest overall recipient of donations was the
chair of the House Armed Services Committee, Representative Howard P.
"Buvk" McKeon, who received 218, 650. The thrity-nin members of the F-35
caucus h ave received a combined total of 1.9m from F-35 contractors,
including a number of smaller companies in the production line. Perhaps
this is why the F-35, despite all of its problems, continues to receive
massive budgetary support. Indeed, the Pentagon's 2015 budget request
include at least 8bn just for the F-35 (equal to the annual budget of
the Environmental Protecion Agency). The F-35 receives a good portion of
this through the Pentagon's procurement budget: 6.3bn. This is a full 7%
of the entire procurement budget of the Pentagon, listed as 90.6bn in
Fiscal Year 2015. And all to buy a 'virtual flying piano.' [[Important
recent developments in the US arms control regime indicate just how much
defense policy can be decided by economic rather than strategic
concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 2009, President Obama announced that
the US was to restructure its arms export control laws. The thrust of
the reforms was to move significant portions of the items on the
Munitions List (which is overseen by the Department of State) onto the
Commercial Control List (CCL), run by the Department of Commerce. The
purported economic benefits of the reforms have been paramount in their
justification. As President Obama promised in 2010, "by enhancing the
competitiveness of our manufacturing and technology sectors, they'll
help us not just increase exports and create jobs, but strengthen our
national security as well."

Writing before the mid-term election results are in, we anticipate that
President Donald J[. Trump will continue to aggressively pursue his
original campaign pledge to rebalance relationships with key US trading
partners]{.underline}. Whichever party controls either chamber of
Congress, President Trump will likely continue pushing the boundaries of
Executive authority to pursue policy objectives unilaterally. **[[The
President will]{.underline}]{.mark}** not, however, be able to ignore
Congress entirely. President Trump will **[quickly n[eed]{.mark} the new
[Congress for legislation to]{.mark} [implement
the]{.mark}]{.underline}** US -- Mexico -- Canada
(**[[USMCA]{.mark})]{.underline}** trade agreement. This is a key policy
objective for President Trump, and was a leading campaign promise in
2016. [Yet, Congressional [approval]{.mark} of the deal [is far from
certain]{.mark}]{.underline}, regardless of which party controls the
House and Senate. **[[The President and his team will have to expend
significant political capital to move the USMCA through

Congressional support to implement any bilateral trade agreements the
Administration negotiates with the United Kingdom (UK), the European
Union (EU), and other sovereign nations in the next two years. But,
because trade does not cut along party lines, President Trump\'s
disruptive trade policies could find allies and opponents on both sides
of the aisle.

#### It's [new NAFTA]{.underline} or [no NAFTA]{.underline}

**Rodriguez 3-4**-2019 -- Sabrina, "Neal: New NAFTA will have 'very
hard' path through Congress," *Politico*,
<https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/04/richard-neal-new-nafta-congress-1232254>

House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal will play a decisive role in
getting Congress to approve President Donald Trump\'s new North American
trade pact. As of now, he predicts it won't be an easy sell for the
Trump administration. "Look, it's going to be very hard to do this,"
Neal said in an interview with POLITICO. Several Democratic and GOP
lawmakers alike have already said they are unhappy with parts of how the
U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement is written, making it increasingly clear
that a tough road lies ahead for getting the deal through both chambers
of Congress. Neal, who leads the powerful House committee responsible
for trade issues, emphasized that he hasn't made up his mind about
USMCA, which the three countries renegotiated last year to take the
place of NAFTA. For his part, Neal stressed that it was too early to
know what it will take for Democrats to support the deal. Congress has
not yet seen the draft bill text of USMCA that they would have to
approve, he noted. But the Massachusetts Democrat offered an early look
at his road map for vetting the deal that Trump has lauded as a \"truly
groundbreaking achievement.\" "[[There seem to be]{.mark} at the moment
[three path]{.mark}s here and that is: a [new NAFTA]{.mark}; a [status
quo NAFTA]{.mark} if nothing happens; [and]{.mark} then [a third]{.mark}
option, [where the president]{.mark} has said he'll [take us out of
NAFTA]{.mark}]{.underline}," Neal said. "**[[I don't think there's
anyone that thinks the status quo \[with the original NAFTA\] is
appropriate]{.underline}]{.mark}**," he said. "So, if you leap to the
next manifestation, it's 'How do you satisfy the critics that you really
have [improved]{.underline} the [trade pact?]{.underline}' And I think
that['s]{.underline} [going to require a lot of effort]{.underline} on
the U.S. trade representative's part." That means U.S. Trade
Representative Robert Lighthizer will have to make a strong sell on the
merits of the new agreement, Neal said. Some House Democrats have
already said they won't vote for the agreement unless the administration
addresses their concerns about how the pact's labor and environmental
standards will be enforced. Others are seeking less-stringent
prescription drug pricing provisions. Asked whether he thinks
renegotiation would be necessary, he said: \"I don't know yet. We really
haven't had anything yet to wrap our arms around.\" Neal\'s response
walks back comments he made last week that indicated he was not in favor
of reopening the agreement. He said then that there would be \"ample
opportunity\" for lawmakers to discuss the deal once a copy of the bill
text is sent to Congress for their review. Neal said the key issue he's
looking at is "enforcement, enforcement, enforcement." He also said
another \"consideration\" is Democrats' concerns that the new deal could
lock in higher prices for a costly class of drugs that have shown
promise in treating cancer and other serious illnesses. Several
lawmakers have told POLITICO that the U.S. trade chief has become more
engaged with lawmakers in recent months, often taking their calls to
listen to specific concerns. Neal\'s chairmanship could bode well for
building the necessary support for congressional approval of USMCA. He
is known for his ability to work across the aisle as a deal-maker, which
could be critical to helping House Speaker Nancy Pelosi deliver the
necessary Democratic votes if party leaders decide to back the deal.

#### USMCA key to [economic]{.underline} and [innovative]{.underline} leadership\-\--otherwise China outcompetes.

David A. **Gantz, 11-15**-2018 - Will Clayton fellow in international
economics at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy and the
Samuel M. Fegtly professor of law at the University of Arizona's James
E. Rogers College of Law; \"US needs USMCA if it\'s serious about
competing with China,\" TheHill,
https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/416739-us-needs-usmca-if-its-serious-about-competing-with-china

The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement ([USMCA]{.underline})
negotiated by the Trump administration [to replace]{.underline} the
North American Free Trade Agreement ([NAFTA]{.underline}) [is to be
signed by the three countries\' presidents Nov. 29. This complex
agreement]{.underline}, which makes major changes in rules governing
automotive trade, dispute settlements and agriculture, while adding or
expanding coverage of such areas as labor rights, environmental
protection, small and medium-sized enterprises, state-owned enterprises,
corruption and e-commerce, [cannot go into force until it is approved
through the applicable constitutional procedures in each member state.
Approval by the Canadian Parliament and Mexican Congress **seems
assured**]{.underline}. [Yet, questions arise as to when and if the U.S.
Congress will approve]{.underline}. [[For]{.underline}]{.mark} many
reasons, including the preservation of North America as a world leader
in **[[manufacturing]{.mark} efficiency]{.underline}**, **[[job
growth]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}** [as well as maintaining **strong
economic**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[political
relations]{.underline}** [with Canada and Mexico]{.underline}, [[it is
**imperative**]{.underline} [for]{.underline}]{.mark} [Congress to
approve [USMCA]{.mark} as soon as possibl]{.underline}e. However,
because a Democratic majority will control the House of Representatives
as of January, enactment of USMCA-approval legislation is less assured
there than in the Senate, where Republicans will maintain their
majority. Under Trade Promotion Authority legislation, the
administration must submit a list of required changes to U.S. law, a
Statement of Administrative Action setting out the nature of the
legislative changes required and a U.S. International Trade Commission
study of the economic effects, all before the agreement can be formally
submitted to Congress, hopefully by mid-March 2019. TPA mandates action
by Congress within 90 legislative days after submission. Congress can
vote only for or against the agreement; no amendment is possible. The
prospects for eventual congressional approval of TPA may not be dimmed
by Democrats\' control of the House, but House consideration of USMCA
could be delayed because of more pressing items on the Democratic
agenda: Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, immigration and health
care, for example. Also, Democrats in the House may demand changes in
the text, most likely to strengthen the labor and environmental
provisions (which are already considerably more robust than those in the
NAFTA "side" agreements), as a condition of supporting the agreement.
Major support for USMCA in the House can be expected from the 200
Republican members, but even if most of them support the agreement, the
administration will need 25 to 30 Democrat votes to reach the 218-vote
majority required for passage. USMCA may attract more votes from
Democrats than has historically been the case for trade agreements. New
automotive rules are expected to create jobs in the U.S., while stronger
labor provisions protecting independent unions in Mexico will likely be
supported by some Democrats because they should result in wage increases
in Mexico and reduce the wage disparity with the U.S. Also, Democrats
who have opposed the inclusion of investor-state dispute settlement in
past trade agreements may welcome its elimination entirely with Canada
and significant narrowing with Mexico. It is possible that Democrats
will take a totally obstructionist position on all Trump administration
initiatives. However, prior to November, current House Minority Leader
Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), the likely Speaker of the House come January,
indicated that Democrats would be looking for areas where they could
cooperate with the Republicans. USMCA approval could well be one of
those areas, even if most Democratic House members decide to oppose it.
While some Republicans might have opposed the president's will if Canada
had been excluded, [given extensive U.S. bilateral trade with Canada and
the **critical importance** of Canadian manufacturers in supply chains
for U.S. manufactured goods]{.underline}, that problem has disappeared.
Also, while business groups have expressed dissatisfaction with USMCA's
investment and government procurement provisions, [it can be expected
that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and many other organizations will
**pressure** both Republicans and Democrats in Congress **to support**
USMCA]{.underline}. Thus, there is still a reasonable possibility that
the USMCA could take effect as soon as Jan. 1, 2020. [[If the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is]{.mark} **seriously
[interested]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in]{.underline} **[competing with
China]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[for]{.mark} world [leadership in]{.mark}
**[innovation]{.mark}**,]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} in [maintaining a
robust]{.mark} North American **[manufacturing]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline} **[export base]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [[the
administration]{.mark} and Congress [must]{.mark} work together to
[enact USMCA]{.mark} as [promptly]{.mark} as possible]{.underline}.

#### Key to all aspects of [hard]{.underline} and [soft power]{.underline}\-\--solves cyber and bioweapon attacks

**Knipfer 17** -- MA Candidate in Space Policy at George Washington
University's Space Policy Institute (Cody, 3/7/17, "On the Nature of
Science and Technology Power,"
<http://www.reallycoolblog.com/on-the-nature-of-science-and-technology-power/>)

Indeed, the **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates' [[leadership in science and
tech]{.mark}nology [has been a]{.mark}]{.underline} historical
[[**cornerstone** of]{.mark} its capacity for "[hard power"]{.mark}
force application and projection [and]{.mark} [economic and
societal]{.mark} ["soft power]{.mark}]{.underline}." It buttresses the
country's economic might, enables the modern standards of living of our
citizenry, and expands our global cultural and normative reach.\[ii\]
Equally so, [the power of science and technology has been decisive
in]{.underline} the context of [national security]{.underline}. As
President Truman noted in 1945, while urging Congress to create a
Department of National Defense, "[no aspect of military preparedness is
more important than scientific research]{.underline}."\[iii\]
[Through]{.underline} discoveries, [technological
innovation]{.underline}, and the capacity to develop ideas into
deployable weapons, systems, and concepts, [the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [has arrived at its modern-day military
advantage and superiority]{.underline}.\[iv\] To that end, [science and
technology may be considered key elements of the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tate[**s'** comprehensive national power]{.underline}
-- [fundamentals of the country's strength vis-à-vis
competitors]{.underline}. Yet science and technology alone cannot ensure
any country's continued security, prosperity, or hegemony; [far from
operating in a vacuum, **s**cience and **t**echnology are **constantly
evolving**]{.underline} to address changing domestic and international
circumstances and threats. [[To reap advantage]{.mark} from science and
technology]{.underline}, especially in their national security
application, [[a country must **continually innovate**]{.mark} to tackle
contemporary developments and anticipate future ones]{.underline}. This
poses a considerable challenge, the solution to which extends beyond
advanced engineering and research. To explore these notions, this essay,
particularly interested in the application of science and technology
toward national security ends, examines the United States' recent
employment of security-related technologies. From this, it explores the
attributes of science and technology power and the similarities and
differences between science and technology power and other forms of
national power such as the economic and diplomatic. Looking at the
relative importance of science and technology in the United States today
and likely significance in the coming future, it lays out a series of
policy recommendations that may guide policymakers as they make
decisions that impact the direction of the country's scientific and
technological course. Employment of -- and Challenges Facing -- National
Security-Related Technolog Recognizing the vital role that technology
played in winning World War Two, along with the emerging threat of
Soviet technological competitiveness, the United States established in
the war's wake an extensive infrastructure to support national security
science and technology efforts. This provided foundation and catalyst
for the development of military capabilities and tools needed to meet
the challenges of the Cold War and the modern day: the nuclear triad,
intelligence-gathering and cyber infrastructure, space-based radar and
communications systems, advanced precision-guided munitions, and
integrated command and control, along with myriad other assets.\[v\]
These technologies have seen extensive use in contemporary military
conflicts. The wars in the Balkans and the Gulf saw the ever-increasing
use of position, navigation, and timing assets such as GPS to provide
precise and reliable information to the warfighter and direct
precision-guided weaponry.\[vi\] Targeted airstrikes and weapons such as
the long-range cruise missile have allowed for far more rapid,
responsive, and accurate strikes than those of the past while
substantially reducing collateral damage. Combat drones and unmanned
aerial vehicles, innovations emblematic of the "War on Terror," enable
the warfighter to engage adversaries and conduct reconnaissance while
safely remaining away from the front lines of the battlefield. Stealth
aircraft, using a range of advanced technologies that reduce reflections
and emissions, have helped pilots conduct sorties while evading
detection.\[vii\] [[Tech]{.mark}nology [abets]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates' [[security]{.mark}
beyond warfighting]{.underline}. [[Advanced **cyber
capabilities**]{.underline}]{.mark} -- encryption, for example -- seek
to [[defend]{.mark} the networks which control the country's power,
transit, and water [infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline} from malicious
hacks and crippling denial of service.\[viii\] [[Tech]{.mark}nologies
[capable of detecting]{.mark} **harmful [bio]{.mark}logical and chemical
[agents]{.mark}** [guard]{.mark}]{.underline} the country
[[against]{.mark} potentially [devastating attack by non-state
actors]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[ix\] Increasingly sophisticated monitoring
and [surveillance technology enables the government to globally track
and work to counter]{.underline} criminal activity, [terrorist
organizations]{.underline}, and other developments which threaten the
country's safety.\[x\] Crucially, though, the United States'
contemporary application of national security systems has also
demonstrated the inherent challenges of innovation and the limitations
of technology. Despite advanced military hardware, principally designed
to fight large-scale conventional wars against Cold War-era foes, the
United States military had to "catch up" and react to unconventional
tactics, such as roadside bombs and sniper attacks, employed against it
in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Though decidedly outnumbered and
outgunned, enemy combatants effectively countered the United States'
asymmetric technological advantage through guerilla warfare, propaganda,
and exploiting collateral damage that advanced weapons systems created
-- doctrines which the United States' technology did not anticipate and
was unprepared or unsuited to counter.\[xi\] Likewise, despite the
sophistication of the United States' homeland security technologies, the
government has struggled to prevent incidents of domestic terrorism such
as mass shootings, often characterized by the use of simple,
off-the-shelf equipment.\[xii\] Meanwhile, [in reaction to]{.underline}
the **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates' present-day
[technological superiority,]{.underline} [**[competitive foreign
powers]{.mark}** such as Russia and China [are]{.mark} heavily
[investing]{.mark} in hardware and capabilities]{.underline} in the
cyber and military realms specifically designed [[to counter]{.mark} the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tate[**s'**
[tech]{.mark}nological [strengths]{.mark}]{.underline} and exploit its
demonstrated vulnerabilities. The technological capabilities underlying
the United States' comparative military advantage are now proliferating
to an increasing number of state and non-state actors, including
potential adversaries, leveling the military "playing field."\[xiii\]
The Attributes of National Security Science and Technology Power From
this, several key attributes and characteristics of science and
technology as a form of national power can be identified. [Foremost is
the capacity for [technology and science]{.mark} to be a]{.underline}
significant, occasionally [**decisive**, [enhance]{.mark}r of [a
country's military strength]{.mark} against enemies]{.underline}.
[Countries which develop innovative military technologies]{.underline}
which effectively counter an adversary's offenses or defensives, or
against which an adversary has no means to protect itself, [find
themselves disproportionately advantaged on the
battlefield]{.underline}. Indeed, technologies which upend dominant
"status quo" warfighting paradigms -- such as, historically, the
introduction of the chariot, the tank, or nuclear weapons -- are poised
to significantly disrupt and reorder the geopolitical and military
balance of power.\[xiv\] To that end, science and technology power,
particularly in the national security sphere, is developed and sustained
through the adaption to, and more so through the anticipation of,
revolutionary changes in military affairs, doctrine, and hardware. As
Lieutenant Colonel Scott Stephenson noted in the influential "The
Revolution in Military Affairs," "those slow to adapt to military
revolutions... are likely to suffer painful results. When the pace of
change accelerates, the militaries that anticipate and adapt are likely
to gain a massive advantage over potential enemies who are less
agile."\[xv\] That agility is, in large part, borne from innovations in
science and the development of new technologies which lead to
unanticipated, and therefore difficult to counter, doctrines. [A
defining characteristic of **s**cience and **t**echnology
power]{.underline}, then, [is the continual quest for states to match,
counter, and out-compete the technology of their adversaries.
This]{.underline} continuing [interplay between technology and national
power, characterized by the sustained technological evolution and
described]{.underline} often [as an "offset," has been a key focus for
national security-related research and development]{.underline}
throughout the Cold War and [into the present]{.underline}. The United
States' deployment of nuclear weapons, for example, offset the numerical
advantage held by the Soviet Union's land forces in the early Cold War.
Soviet parity in nuclear weapons catalyzed the development of guided
weapon and integrated command and control as a counter, focusing on
accuracy of targeted weapons systems independent of range.\[xvi\] The
United States' capacity to offset Soviet technology through innovative
developments -- and the Soviet bankruptcy borne from military
expenditure that came as a corollary -- was an important factor in
maintaining a generally peaceful stable of power along with the
country's ultimate triumph in the Cold War. In the present-day, China
and Russia's focus on countering the systems and technologies which
currently provide the United States' military asymmetry is emblematic of
this "offset" approach to science and technology power. Paradoxically,
however, national security-related technology in the present day has
become as great an equalizer as it has historically been a separator of
actors' strengths. Technological superiority in the present may provide
the United States' unrivaled military strength, especially against foes
(historically, state actors with large conventional forces) for which
its national security technologies anticipated countering. Yet as the
example of the Iraq and Afghani insurgencies amply demonstrated,
technological superiority coupled with innovation focused on addressing
hypothetical future battlefields may not be adequate to oppose or defeat
all actors or all forms of warfare, regardless of the level of their
sophistication. Indeed, advanced technologies may be entirely vulnerable
to actors utilizing doctrines with simple technologies that nonetheless
exploit their weaknesses, as was the case with sophisticated -- and
expensive -- American vehicles being destroyed by crude, homemade IEDs.
Technology itself also creates weaknesses; the United States'
progressing economic and social reliance upon interconnected networks,
for example, makes the country more vulnerable to potentially crippling
attack. Despite advanced American cybersecurity technologies and
techniques, non-state actors have still proven themselves capable of
infiltrating, attacking, and even denying use of American cyber
capabilities; considering recent trends, this vulnerable seems likely to
continue, if not worsen.\[xvii\] It may be that an attribute of science
and technology power, borne more from the focus and perceptions of the
technologists, theorists, and military leadership that employ it than
from science and technology itself, is that it obscures other factors
which equally dictate important developments in military, international,
and geopolitical affairs. Political upheaval, social change, and
economic development can change warfare dramatically, for example -- and
have nothing to do with "offset" strategies or war-room predictions of
possible enemies' future high-tech military hardware. As a product of
the military-industrial complex that emerged in the Cold War United
States to sustain continued technological development, Americans tend to
be acutely -- perhaps overly -- sensitive to technological innovation
among competitors and potential rivals. Fears during the Cold War and
contemporary discussions of the "Third Offset" paint pictures of
emerging, potential, and fanciful enemy weapon systems -- which military
planning and technology development was and is oriented toward
countering.\[xviii\] This fixation on solutions entailing engineering
and technological complexity blinds the national security technology
apparatus to external trends that could definitively impact the future
course of war -- such as the collapse of the Soviet Union leaving the
United States with a high-tech military and warfighting doctrine
unsuited for the military pressures and asymmetric nature of
counterinsurgency; the rise of radical terrorism with ideological
underpinnings that condone unconventional guerilla tactics such as
suicide bombings, which had great effect against high-tech targets; or
the continuing crisis where lone-wolf gunmen using off-the-shelf rifles
can commit massacres despite the government's highly complex and
pervasive surveillance and monitoring technology. Similarities and
Differences to Other Forms of National Power With these attributes in
mind, a comparison can be drawn between science and technology power and
other forms of power which constitute a country's comprehensive
strength, such as the economic and diplomatic. Regarding the economic,
science and technology power is similar in that the development of
science and technology is driven by the same forces as economic growth.
Like new economic products, services, and methods of operation,
[**s**cience and **t**echnology power relies upon the ingenuity of human
actors predicting and anticipating future trends]{.underline},
possibilities, and human behavior.
**[[Innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, iteration, [[and
**competitiveness** are fundamental]{.mark} catalysts for the continued
evolution and growth]{.underline} of both. The rapid proliferation and
subsequent use of innovative technologies across the world quickly
equalizes both the national security advantage and the economic
advantage they provided their inventor. Economic power, like national
security technology, is a key element of a country's warfighting
capability -- industrial might, strength in quality production, and
capable infrastructure are crucial facets of a country's ability to
mobilize and project force. A fundamental difference between economic
power and science and technology power, however, is competition. While
economies naturally compete, there is incentive for states to specialize
in the economic product or service most suited for it -- their
comparative advantage. [Competing economies are not actively
incentivized to counter the economic specialization of their rivals.
With science and technology power for national security]{.underline}
use, however, [states]{.underline} decidedly [hope to actively and
explicitly counter the relative advantage of their
adversaries]{.underline}. Like diplomatic power, [**s**cience and
**t**echnology has a "**soft power" element**; other states and their
societies may be influenced or compelled to action by the]{.underline}
might, [prestige, or cultural and technological hegemony of a
country]{.underline} in possession of highly advanced and capable
technologies.\[xix\] Diplomatic power occasionally experiences the same
issue of science and technology policy in being blinded to unpredicted
or external trends in the social, cultural, and economic spheres. The
power of diplomacy, for example, did not anticipate and struggled to
deal with the cultural, social, and political circumstances that led to
a breakdown of order in post-invasion Iraq; just as national security
technology was unprepared for the guerilla warfare of the Iraqi
insurgency. Diplomatic power and science and technology power differ,
though, in the fields of innovation and evolution. Whereas the military
regime is constantly evolving and occasionally being upended by
revolutions in security technology and associated doctrine, the
Westphalian diplomatic order has remained largely similar through
centuries -- even as it has grown gradually more complex and
interconnected. States do not tend seek to outcompete each other in the
diplomatic sphere through revolutionary new approaches to diplomacy;
negotiations, sanctions, deals, bi- and multilateral agreements, and the
like have remained consistent "doctrines" employed by states in their
dealings with international friends and foes. Science and Technology
Power's Present and Future Importance To return to Vannevar Bush's
assertion over half a century ago, science and technology is crucially
important for a states' economic growth and prosperity, the wellbeing of
its citizens, and national security. This remains absolutely the case
today. [Despite the challenges facing innovation]{.underline} in the
face of unanticipated adversaries and the proliferation of advanced,
equalizing technologies among adversarial states and non-state actors,
[science and technology provides the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates' **[unrivaled]{.underline}** levels of security
and **[military hegemony]{.underline}**. [[With]{.underline}]{.mark} the
appearance of **[[significant]{.mark} [global
challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- [refugee crises, environmental
degradation, the possible [emergence of a]{.mark}]{.underline} bi- or
[[**multi-polar world** characterized by]{.mark} states
with]{.underline} rough or equal **[[tech]{.mark}nological
[parity]{.mark}]{.underline}**, to name a few -- [the **future
importance of [science and technology]{.mark} power** [cut]{.mark}ting
[across all aspects of national]{.mark} [security]{.mark}
will]{.underline} undoubtedly [**redouble**. Science and technology and
its application as an element of]{.underline} the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates' [national power will
need to be directed to address these challenges]{.underline}. While the
exact characteristics that will define domestic and foreign national
security technologies of the future -- not to mention the economic and
social -- remain uncertain, [[the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[cannot afford to permit its current
tech]{.mark}nological [advantage]{.mark} [to slip]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Indeed, [as revision states such as China continue to develop their
technologies to]{.underline} directly [counter]{.underline} the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates' [capabilities, [it
will]{.mark}]{.underline} likely [[become]{.mark} an
**[imperative]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the country [[to]{.mark} **more
actively engage in and support**]{.underline} the
**[[develop]{.mark}ment of innovative [new]{.mark} security
[tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}** and doctrines --
[[lest]{.underline}]{.mark}, as history would suggest, [the
**[international order]{.mark} again [be upended]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### Prevents global nuclear war

**Henricksen 17** -- emeritus senior fellow at the Hoover Institution

The [[tensions stoked by]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[assertive
regimes]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Kremlin or Tiananmen Square [[could
**spark**]{.mark} **a political or military incident** that might set
off [a chain reaction leading to a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[large-scale
war]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Historically, powerful rivalries nearly
always lead to at least skirmishes, if not a full-blown war. [The
anomalous [Cold War]{.mark} era]{.underline}
**[[spared]{.underline}]{.mark}** the United States and Soviet Russia a
direct conflict, largely from concerns that one would trigger a
**[[nuclear exchange destroying]{.underline}]{.mark}** both states and
much of [**[the world]{.mark}**. Such a [repetition **might**
reoccur]{.mark} in the unfolding]{.underline} three-cornered
[geopolitical world]{.underline}. It seems safe to acknowledge that an
ascendant China and a resurgent Russia will persist in their
geo-strategic ambitions. What Is To Be Done? The first marching order is
to dodge any kind of perpetual war of the sort that George Orwell
outlined in "1984," which engulfed the three super states of Eastasia,
Eurasia, and Oceania, and made possible the totalitarian Big Brother
regime. A long-running Cold War-type confrontation would almost
certainly take another form than the one that ran from 1945 until the
downfall of the Soviet Union. What prescriptions can be offered in the
face of the escalating competition among the three global powers? First,
[[by **staying militarily and economically strong**, the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[will]{.mark}
have the resources to [deter]{.mark}]{.underline} its peers' hawkish
behavior that might otherwise trigger a **[[major
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Judging by the history of the Cold War,
[[the]{.mark} coming [strategic chess match]{.mark} with Russia and
China [will prove tense]{.mark} and
demanding]{.underline}---[[since]{.underline}
**[all]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the [countries boast nuclear
arms]{.mark}]{.underline}** and long-range ballistic missiles. Next, the
United States should widen and sustain willing coalitions of partners,
something at which America excels, and at which China and Russia fail
conspicuously. [[There can be **little**]{.mark} **room for
[error]{.mark}** in]{.underline} fraught **[crises [among
nuclear]{.mark}-weaponized]{.underline}** and **[[hostile
powers]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Short- and long-term standoffs are
likely, as they were during the Cold War. Thus, the playbook, in part,
involves a waiting game in which each power looks to its rivals to
suffer grievous internal problems which could entail a collapse, as
happened to the Soviet Union.

American Free Trade Agreement that became law in 1994. Many rural
lawmakers and agricultural leaders pushed to keep the United States from
pulling out of NAFTA before and are pushing for Congress to approve the
USMCA now. But there has been some opposition in both parties. [Grassley
said]{.underline} the biggest roadblock now is with Democrats in the
House, but he said [Speaker of the House Nancy **[Pelosi is working with

concerns are in regards to items such as environmental or labor issues

#### The plan costs Trump his vital source of PC \-- Trump maintains his base support by promising to secure the last good assembly-line jobs in America 

**Exum 2017**

Andrew, The Atlantic, former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense
for Middle East policy, "What Progressives Miss About Arms Sales," May
23, 2017
<https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/americas-right-to-sell-arms/527805/>//dmr

I want to spend a little time talking about one of the reasons why the
trip went so well. I'll warn you: This is a somewhat taboo subject for
progressive foreign-policy types. The subject, friends, is arms sales.
[Progressives don't like **[arms sales]{.mark}** very much, but they
need to pay attention to them, because **they'[re one big way
Republicans are]{.mark}** [**fighting for---and winning---the votes of
working-class Americans who**]{.mark} have **[traditionally
vote]{.mark}**d for **[Dem]{.mark}**ocrats]{.underline}. While the
president was in Saudi Arabia, the Trump administration announced \$110
billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia---with an additional \$240 billion
committed over a 10-year period. If you've ever worked in government,
you know this is what is called a "deliverable," the clunky
management-consultantese term for a tangible outcome of a visit or
meeting. When Donald Trump is asked to justify his trip to Saudi Arabia,
he'll cite that \$110 billion in arms sales. There are a few interesting
things about these sales. The first is that many of these sales were
already in the works. The Obama administration spent eight years quietly
selling a lot of arms to Saudi Arabia: When President Obama left office,
for example, the United States still had \$100 billion in the foreign
military sales pipeline with Saudi Arabia and, in 2011, had inked what
was previously the largest arms sale in U.S. history with the
Kingdom---a \$29 billion deal to sell F-15s to the Saudis. Obama-era
sales to Saudi Arabia were in keeping with sales to other Gulf states:
Both Qatar and the United Arab Emirates bought a tremendous amount of
U.S. arms between 2009 and 2017. Qatar bought more U.S. arms than any
other state in 2014 and, in the waning days of the Obama administration,
announced that it would buy nearly \$4 billion in Boeing-made F-15s in
addition to \$19 billion in commercial aircraft, also from Boeing.
Overall, the Arab Gulf states went on a spending spree during the Obama
years, and most of the money was spent on American arms. So why didn't
you hear a lot about this from Democratic politicians during the 2016
election season? There are two main reasons---one strategic and one
moral. Strategically, not everyone is convinced that arming the Arab
Gulf states to the teeth is a wise idea. Some worry that these arms
might someday endanger Israel's security, while others worry the Arab
Gulf states might be encouraged to use their new toys on disastrous
military interventions against Iran or Iranian proxies in, say, Yemen.
The quick and unsatisfying answer to these concerns is the global
market. The Arab Gulf states have money, and that money will buy the
weapons that are available. If U.S. arms are not for sale, fine: French,
Chinese, or Russian arms will be. (And if you don't believe me, look at
the way in which Gulf states---frustrated by U.S. export controls on
drone technology---are turning to the Chinese.) Selling U.S. arms to the
Gulf states, by contrast, further ties them to U.S. interests by
deepening cooperation and interoperability between the U.S. military and
its Gulf partners. One of the reasons Qatar wanted to buy U.S. fighters
to partially replace its French-made fleet, for example, was because
they discovered how difficult it was for their existing fighter aircraft
to fly with the U.S. air force as part of coalitions over Libya and
Syria. Arms sales also drive down the cost of our own weapons and thus
the amount of money U.S. tax-payers have to spend on defense instead of
other priorities like, say, the State Department, school lunches, or
housing subsidies. Here's one example: Because the United States is
buying fewer F-35s than originally planned and using more of its "fourth
generation" fighters (F-15s, F-16s, etc.) in the skies over Iraq and
Syria than previously anticipated, the Department of Defense will likely
need to buy more of those fourth generation fighters in the coming
years. The recent sales of F-15s to Qatar, F-18s to Kuwait, and F-16s to
Bahrain will drive down the cost per plane for the Pentagon. That's a
good thing---at least financially. Morally, though, many progressives
just grow ill at the idea of selling weapons abroad. Senator Chris
Murphy, for example---one of the more eloquent and consistent critics of
U.S. arms sales in the Senate, even though his own state has a very
robust defense industrial base---sees nothing admirable about the idea
of selling weapons to the Saudis that might be used in Yemen. Other
progressives agree: Yes, they argue, we understand the demand of the
market will be met by someone, but do we have to be complicit in
providing the supply? In other countries, progressives have even taken
to the courts in an effort to halt sales. I have a lot of respect for
these progressives and their values. I spent too much time in Sunday
School as a kid to not feel a little uneasy about the business of
selling weapons. And [**the angst many progressives feel about U.S. arms
sales has been enough to keep many Democrats from talking up their
successes** in helping U.S. industry abroad. I wonder, though, if there
isn't a real political cost to not doing so.]{.underline} Boeing employs
157,000 people---almost all of them in the United States. 14,500 people
work in Boeing's facilities in Missouri, where the F-15 and F-18 are
made, where Senator Claire McCaskill is up for reelection next year, and
where Donald Trump trounced Hillary Clinton 56 to 38 percent in 2016.
(Those 14,500 people do not include the many thousands of other
Americans who make parts for the F-15 and F-18 elsewhere in America.)
Lockheed Martin, meanwhile, a huge winner in the recent arms deal with
Saudi Arabia (despite ace businessman Jared Kushner negotiating the
price down on behalf of the Saudis), employs an additional 97,000
workers---again, most of them in the United States. And Raytheon,
another big winner last week, employs another 60,000 or so Americans.
Donald **[Trump]{.underline}** obviously [**has no moral qualms about
selling weapons** to our partners and allies abroad]{.underline}. And
[**so** while **Democrats leave points on the board with working-class
voters by not talking about how much Democrats do to support U.S.
industry, Republicans swoop in to take credit with assembly line workers
for even those things that Obama** approved and **set in
motion**]{.underline}. The way in which Trump brags about U.S. arms
sales, of course, is in keeping with the strain of economic mercantilism
that ran through his populist campaign message. That message worked with
voters throughout the Midwest, helping to cost Clinton the election. So
while progressives might have moral qualms about companies that sell
weapons, [**[the roughly 1.2 million]{.mark}** American
**[voters]{.mark}** who **[work in]{.mark}** the aerospace and
**[defense]{.mark}** sector---together **[with]{.mark}** the **[roughly
3.2 million]{.mark}** Americans [**who support the sector
indirectly**---**see little wrong with the sales that**]{.mark} help
**[ensure their livelihoods and provide]{.mark}** a future **[for their
children]{.mark}.**]{.underline} This might be another area in which
progressive elites---who have the kinds of education and skills that
don't require them to seek work on the assembly line---are simply out of
touch with the voters they need to win back control of the Congress and
state assemblies, never mind the presidency. And politics aside, surely
even the moral calculus of arms sales gets more complicated when you
think about the [millions of American mouths]{.underline} that [are fed
by mothers and fathers who work in the aerospace and defense
sector.]{.underline} Donald **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for his
part, **[[is speaking to those voters]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And even
as [progressives]{.underline} fret about U.S. arms sales, they
[should]{.underline} also [fret about what it will mean for]{.underline}
the rest of [their agenda when **[Republicans claim credit for
protecting some of the last good assembly-line jobs in
America]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Writing before the mid-term election results are in, we anticipate that
President Donald J[. Trump will continue to aggressively pursue his
original campaign pledge to rebalance relationships with key US trading
partners]{.underline}. Whichever party controls either chamber of
Congress, President Trump will likely continue pushing the boundaries of
Executive authority to pursue policy objectives unilaterally. **[[The
President will]{.underline}]{.mark}** not, however, be able to ignore
Congress entirely. President Trump will **[quickly n[eed]{.mark} the new
[Congress for legislation to]{.mark} [implement
the]{.mark}]{.underline}** US -- Mexico -- Canada
(**[[USMCA]{.mark})]{.underline}** trade agreement. This is a key policy
objective for President Trump, and was a leading campaign promise in
2016. [Yet, Congressional [approval]{.mark} of the deal [is far from
certain]{.mark}]{.underline}, regardless of which party controls the
House and Senate. **[[The President and his team will have to expend
significant political capital to move the USMCA through
Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Similarly, President Trump will need
Congressional support to implement any bilateral trade agreements the
Administration negotiates with the United Kingdom (UK), the European
Union (EU), and other sovereign nations in the next two years. But,
because trade does not cut along party lines, President Trump\'s
disruptive trade policies could find allies and opponents on both sides
of the aisle.

#### It's [new NAFTA]{.underline} or [no NAFTA]{.underline}

**Rodriguez 3-4**-2019 -- Sabrina, "Neal: New NAFTA will have 'very
hard' path through Congress," *Politico*,
<https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/04/richard-neal-new-nafta-congress-1232254>

House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal will play a decisive role in
getting Congress to approve President Donald Trump\'s new North American
trade pact. As of now, he predicts it won't be an easy sell for the
Trump administration. "Look, it's going to be very hard to do this,"
Neal said in an interview with POLITICO. Several Democratic and GOP
lawmakers alike have already said they are unhappy with parts of how the
U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement is written, making it increasingly clear
that a tough road lies ahead for getting the deal through both chambers
of Congress. Neal, who leads the powerful House committee responsible
for trade issues, emphasized that he hasn't made up his mind about
USMCA, which the three countries renegotiated last year to take the
place of NAFTA. For his part, Neal stressed that it was too early to
know what it will take for Democrats to support the deal. Congress has
not yet seen the draft bill text of USMCA that they would have to
approve, he noted. But the Massachusetts Democrat offered an early look
at his road map for vetting the deal that Trump has lauded as a \"truly
groundbreaking achievement.\" "[[There seem to be]{.mark} at the moment
[three path]{.mark}s here and that is: a [new NAFTA]{.mark}; a [status
quo NAFTA]{.mark} if nothing happens; [and]{.mark} then [a third]{.mark}
option, [where the president]{.mark} has said he'll [take us out of
NAFTA]{.mark}]{.underline}," Neal said. "**[[I don't think there's
anyone that thinks the status quo \[with the original NAFTA\] is
appropriate]{.underline}]{.mark}**," he said. "So, if you leap to the
next manifestation, it's 'How do you satisfy the critics that you really
have [improved]{.underline} the [trade pact?]{.underline}' And I think
that['s]{.underline} [going to require a lot of effort]{.underline} on
the U.S. trade representative's part." That means U.S. Trade
Representative Robert Lighthizer will have to make a strong sell on the
merits of the new agreement, Neal said. Some House Democrats have
already said they won't vote for the agreement unless the administration
addresses their concerns about how the pact's labor and environmental
standards will be enforced. Others are seeking less-stringent
prescription drug pricing provisions. Asked whether he thinks
renegotiation would be necessary, he said: \"I don't know yet. We really
haven't had anything yet to wrap our arms around.\" Neal\'s response
walks back comments he made last week that indicated he was not in favor
of reopening the agreement. He said then that there would be \"ample
opportunity\" for lawmakers to discuss the deal once a copy of the bill
text is sent to Congress for their review. Neal said the key issue he's
looking at is "enforcement, enforcement, enforcement." He also said
another \"consideration\" is Democrats' concerns that the new deal could
lock in higher prices for a costly class of drugs that have shown
promise in treating cancer and other serious illnesses. Several
lawmakers have told POLITICO that the U.S. trade chief has become more
engaged with lawmakers in recent months, often taking their calls to
listen to specific concerns. Neal\'s chairmanship could bode well for
building the necessary support for congressional approval of USMCA. He
is known for his ability to work across the aisle as a deal-maker, which
could be critical to helping House Speaker Nancy Pelosi deliver the
necessary Democratic votes if party leaders decide to back the deal.

#### USMCA key to [economic]{.underline} and [innovative]{.underline} leadership\-\--otherwise China outcompetes.

David A. **Gantz, 11-15**-2018 - Will Clayton fellow in international
economics at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy and the
Samuel M. Fegtly professor of law at the University of Arizona's James
E. Rogers College of Law; \"US needs USMCA if it\'s serious about
competing with China,\" TheHill,
https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/416739-us-needs-usmca-if-its-serious-about-competing-with-china

The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement ([USMCA]{.underline})
negotiated by the Trump administration [to replace]{.underline} the
North American Free Trade Agreement ([NAFTA]{.underline}) [is to be
signed by the three countries\' presidents Nov. 29. This complex
agreement]{.underline}, which makes major changes in rules governing
automotive trade, dispute settlements and agriculture, while adding or
expanding coverage of such areas as labor rights, environmental
protection, small and medium-sized enterprises, state-owned enterprises,
corruption and e-commerce, [cannot go into force until it is approved
through the applicable constitutional procedures in each member state.
Approval by the Canadian Parliament and Mexican Congress **seems
assured**]{.underline}. [Yet, questions arise as to when and if the U.S.
Congress will approve]{.underline}. [[For]{.underline}]{.mark} many
reasons, including the preservation of North America as a world leader
in **[[manufacturing]{.mark} efficiency]{.underline}**, **[[job
growth]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}** [as well as maintaining **strong
economic**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[political
relations]{.underline}** [with Canada and Mexico]{.underline}, [[it is
**imperative**]{.underline} [for]{.underline}]{.mark} [Congress to
approve [USMCA]{.mark} as soon as possibl]{.underline}e. However,
because a Democratic majority will control the House of Representatives
as of January, enactment of USMCA-approval legislation is less assured
there than in the Senate, where Republicans will maintain their
majority. Under Trade Promotion Authority legislation, the
administration must submit a list of required changes to U.S. law, a
Statement of Administrative Action setting out the nature of the
legislative changes required and a U.S. International Trade Commission
study of the economic effects, all before the agreement can be formally
submitted to Congress, hopefully by mid-March 2019. TPA mandates action
by Congress within 90 legislative days after submission. Congress can
vote only for or against the agreement; no amendment is possible. The
prospects for eventual congressional approval of TPA may not be dimmed
by Democrats\' control of the House, but House consideration of USMCA
could be delayed because of more pressing items on the Democratic
agenda: Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, immigration and health
care, for example. Also, Democrats in the House may demand changes in
the text, most likely to strengthen the labor and environmental
provisions (which are already considerably more robust than those in the
NAFTA "side" agreements), as a condition of supporting the agreement.
Major support for USMCA in the House can be expected from the 200
Republican members, but even if most of them support the agreement, the
administration will need 25 to 30 Democrat votes to reach the 218-vote
majority required for passage. USMCA may attract more votes from
Democrats than has historically been the case for trade agreements. New
automotive rules are expected to create jobs in the U.S., while stronger
labor provisions protecting independent unions in Mexico will likely be
supported by some Democrats because they should result in wage increases
in Mexico and reduce the wage disparity with the U.S. Also, Democrats
who have opposed the inclusion of investor-state dispute settlement in
past trade agreements may welcome its elimination entirely with Canada
and significant narrowing with Mexico. It is possible that Democrats
will take a totally obstructionist position on all Trump administration
initiatives. However, prior to November, current House Minority Leader
Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), the likely Speaker of the House come January,
indicated that Democrats would be looking for areas where they could
cooperate with the Republicans. USMCA approval could well be one of
those areas, even if most Democratic House members decide to oppose it.
While some Republicans might have opposed the president's will if Canada
had been excluded, [given extensive U.S. bilateral trade with Canada and
the **critical importance** of Canadian manufacturers in supply chains
for U.S. manufactured goods]{.underline}, that problem has disappeared.
Also, while business groups have expressed dissatisfaction with USMCA's
investment and government procurement provisions, [it can be expected

#### Key to all aspects of [hard]{.underline} and [soft power]{.underline}\-\--solves cyber and bioweapon attacks

**Knipfer 17** -- MA Candidate in Space Policy at George Washington
University's Space Policy Institute (Cody, 3/7/17, "On the Nature of
Science and Technology Power,"
<http://www.reallycoolblog.com/on-the-nature-of-science-and-technology-power/>)

Indeed, the **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates' [[leadership in science and
tech]{.mark}nology [has been a]{.mark}]{.underline} historical
[[**cornerstone** of]{.mark} its capacity for "[hard power"]{.mark}
force application and projection [and]{.mark} [economic and
societal]{.mark} ["soft power]{.mark}]{.underline}." It buttresses the
country's economic might, enables the modern standards of living of our
citizenry, and expands our global cultural and normative reach.\[ii\]
Equally so, [the power of science and technology has been decisive
in]{.underline} the context of [national security]{.underline}. As
President Truman noted in 1945, while urging Congress to create a
Department of National Defense, "[no aspect of military preparedness is
more important than scientific research]{.underline}."\[iii\]
[Through]{.underline} discoveries, [technological
innovation]{.underline}, and the capacity to develop ideas into
deployable weapons, systems, and concepts, [the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [has arrived at its modern-day military
advantage and superiority]{.underline}.\[iv\] To that end, [science and
technology may be considered key elements of the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tate[**s'** comprehensive national power]{.underline}
-- [fundamentals of the country's strength vis-à-vis
competitors]{.underline}. Yet science and technology alone cannot ensure
any country's continued security, prosperity, or hegemony; [far from
operating in a vacuum, **s**cience and **t**echnology are **constantly
evolving**]{.underline} to address changing domestic and international
circumstances and threats. [[To reap advantage]{.mark} from science and
technology]{.underline}, especially in their national security
application, [[a country must **continually innovate**]{.mark} to tackle
contemporary developments and anticipate future ones]{.underline}. This
poses a considerable challenge, the solution to which extends beyond
advanced engineering and research. To explore these notions, this essay,
particularly interested in the application of science and technology
toward national security ends, examines the United States' recent
employment of security-related technologies. From this, it explores the
attributes of science and technology power and the similarities and
differences between science and technology power and other forms of
national power such as the economic and diplomatic. Looking at the
relative importance of science and technology in the United States today
and likely significance in the coming future, it lays out a series of
policy recommendations that may guide policymakers as they make
decisions that impact the direction of the country's scientific and
technological course. Employment of -- and Challenges Facing -- National
Security-Related Technolog Recognizing the vital role that technology
played in winning World War Two, along with the emerging threat of
Soviet technological competitiveness, the United States established in
the war's wake an extensive infrastructure to support national security
science and technology efforts. This provided foundation and catalyst
for the development of military capabilities and tools needed to meet
the challenges of the Cold War and the modern day: the nuclear triad,
intelligence-gathering and cyber infrastructure, space-based radar and
communications systems, advanced precision-guided munitions, and
integrated command and control, along with myriad other assets.\[v\]
These technologies have seen extensive use in contemporary military
conflicts. The wars in the Balkans and the Gulf saw the ever-increasing
use of position, navigation, and timing assets such as GPS to provide
precise and reliable information to the warfighter and direct
precision-guided weaponry.\[vi\] Targeted airstrikes and weapons such as
the long-range cruise missile have allowed for far more rapid,
responsive, and accurate strikes than those of the past while
substantially reducing collateral damage. Combat drones and unmanned
aerial vehicles, innovations emblematic of the "War on Terror," enable
the warfighter to engage adversaries and conduct reconnaissance while
safely remaining away from the front lines of the battlefield. Stealth
aircraft, using a range of advanced technologies that reduce reflections
and emissions, have helped pilots conduct sorties while evading
detection.\[vii\] [[Tech]{.mark}nology [abets]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates' [[security]{.mark}
beyond warfighting]{.underline}. [[Advanced **cyber
capabilities**]{.underline}]{.mark} -- encryption, for example -- seek
to [[defend]{.mark} the networks which control the country's power,
transit, and water [infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline} from malicious
hacks and crippling denial of service.\[viii\] [[Tech]{.mark}nologies
[capable of detecting]{.mark} **harmful [bio]{.mark}logical and chemical
[agents]{.mark}** [guard]{.mark}]{.underline} the country
[[against]{.mark} potentially [devastating attack by non-state
actors]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[ix\] Increasingly sophisticated monitoring
and [surveillance technology enables the government to globally track
and work to counter]{.underline} criminal activity, [terrorist
organizations]{.underline}, and other developments which threaten the
country's safety.\[x\] Crucially, though, the United States'
contemporary application of national security systems has also
demonstrated the inherent challenges of innovation and the limitations
of technology. Despite advanced military hardware, principally designed
to fight large-scale conventional wars against Cold War-era foes, the
United States military had to "catch up" and react to unconventional
tactics, such as roadside bombs and sniper attacks, employed against it
in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Though decidedly outnumbered and
outgunned, enemy combatants effectively countered the United States'
asymmetric technological advantage through guerilla warfare, propaganda,
and exploiting collateral damage that advanced weapons systems created
-- doctrines which the United States' technology did not anticipate and
was unprepared or unsuited to counter.\[xi\] Likewise, despite the
sophistication of the United States' homeland security technologies, the
government has struggled to prevent incidents of domestic terrorism such
as mass shootings, often characterized by the use of simple,
off-the-shelf equipment.\[xii\] Meanwhile, [in reaction to]{.underline}
the **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates' present-day
[technological superiority,]{.underline} [**[competitive foreign
powers]{.mark}** such as Russia and China [are]{.mark} heavily
[investing]{.mark} in hardware and capabilities]{.underline} in the
cyber and military realms specifically designed [[to counter]{.mark} the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tate[**s'**
[tech]{.mark}nological [strengths]{.mark}]{.underline} and exploit its
demonstrated vulnerabilities. The technological capabilities underlying
the United States' comparative military advantage are now proliferating
to an increasing number of state and non-state actors, including
potential adversaries, leveling the military "playing field."\[xiii\]
The Attributes of National Security Science and Technology Power From
this, several key attributes and characteristics of science and
technology as a form of national power can be identified. [Foremost is
the capacity for [technology and science]{.mark} to be a]{.underline}
significant, occasionally [**decisive**, [enhance]{.mark}r of [a
country's military strength]{.mark} against enemies]{.underline}.
[Countries which develop innovative military technologies]{.underline}
which effectively counter an adversary's offenses or defensives, or
against which an adversary has no means to protect itself, [find
themselves disproportionately advantaged on the
battlefield]{.underline}. Indeed, technologies which upend dominant
"status quo" warfighting paradigms -- such as, historically, the
introduction of the chariot, the tank, or nuclear weapons -- are poised
to significantly disrupt and reorder the geopolitical and military
balance of power.\[xiv\] To that end, science and technology power,
particularly in the national security sphere, is developed and sustained
through the adaption to, and more so through the anticipation of,
revolutionary changes in military affairs, doctrine, and hardware. As
Lieutenant Colonel Scott Stephenson noted in the influential "The
Revolution in Military Affairs," "those slow to adapt to military
revolutions... are likely to suffer painful results. When the pace of
change accelerates, the militaries that anticipate and adapt are likely
to gain a massive advantage over potential enemies who are less
agile."\[xv\] That agility is, in large part, borne from innovations in
science and the development of new technologies which lead to
unanticipated, and therefore difficult to counter, doctrines. [A
defining characteristic of **s**cience and **t**echnology
power]{.underline}, then, [is the continual quest for states to match,
counter, and out-compete the technology of their adversaries.
This]{.underline} continuing [interplay between technology and national
power, characterized by the sustained technological evolution and
described]{.underline} often [as an "offset," has been a key focus for
national security-related research and development]{.underline}
throughout the Cold War and [into the present]{.underline}. The United
States' deployment of nuclear weapons, for example, offset the numerical
advantage held by the Soviet Union's land forces in the early Cold War.
Soviet parity in nuclear weapons catalyzed the development of guided
weapon and integrated command and control as a counter, focusing on
accuracy of targeted weapons systems independent of range.\[xvi\] The
United States' capacity to offset Soviet technology through innovative
developments -- and the Soviet bankruptcy borne from military
expenditure that came as a corollary -- was an important factor in
maintaining a generally peaceful stable of power along with the
country's ultimate triumph in the Cold War. In the present-day, China
and Russia's focus on countering the systems and technologies which
currently provide the United States' military asymmetry is emblematic of
this "offset" approach to science and technology power. Paradoxically,
however, national security-related technology in the present day has
become as great an equalizer as it has historically been a separator of
actors' strengths. Technological superiority in the present may provide
the United States' unrivaled military strength, especially against foes
(historically, state actors with large conventional forces) for which
its national security technologies anticipated countering. Yet as the
example of the Iraq and Afghani insurgencies amply demonstrated,
technological superiority coupled with innovation focused on addressing
hypothetical future battlefields may not be adequate to oppose or defeat
all actors or all forms of warfare, regardless of the level of their
sophistication. Indeed, advanced technologies may be entirely vulnerable
to actors utilizing doctrines with simple technologies that nonetheless
exploit their weaknesses, as was the case with sophisticated -- and
expensive -- American vehicles being destroyed by crude, homemade IEDs.
Technology itself also creates weaknesses; the United States'
progressing economic and social reliance upon interconnected networks,
for example, makes the country more vulnerable to potentially crippling
attack. Despite advanced American cybersecurity technologies and
techniques, non-state actors have still proven themselves capable of
infiltrating, attacking, and even denying use of American cyber
capabilities; considering recent trends, this vulnerable seems likely to
continue, if not worsen.\[xvii\] It may be that an attribute of science
and technology power, borne more from the focus and perceptions of the
technologists, theorists, and military leadership that employ it than
from science and technology itself, is that it obscures other factors
which equally dictate important developments in military, international,
and geopolitical affairs. Political upheaval, social change, and
economic development can change warfare dramatically, for example -- and
have nothing to do with "offset" strategies or war-room predictions of
possible enemies' future high-tech military hardware. As a product of
the military-industrial complex that emerged in the Cold War United
States to sustain continued technological development, Americans tend to
be acutely -- perhaps overly -- sensitive to technological innovation
among competitors and potential rivals. Fears during the Cold War and
contemporary discussions of the "Third Offset" paint pictures of
emerging, potential, and fanciful enemy weapon systems -- which military
planning and technology development was and is oriented toward
countering.\[xviii\] This fixation on solutions entailing engineering
and technological complexity blinds the national security technology
apparatus to external trends that could definitively impact the future
course of war -- such as the collapse of the Soviet Union leaving the
United States with a high-tech military and warfighting doctrine
unsuited for the military pressures and asymmetric nature of
counterinsurgency; the rise of radical terrorism with ideological
underpinnings that condone unconventional guerilla tactics such as
suicide bombings, which had great effect against high-tech targets; or
the continuing crisis where lone-wolf gunmen using off-the-shelf rifles
can commit massacres despite the government's highly complex and
pervasive surveillance and monitoring technology. Similarities and
Differences to Other Forms of National Power With these attributes in
mind, a comparison can be drawn between science and technology power and
other forms of power which constitute a country's comprehensive
strength, such as the economic and diplomatic. Regarding the economic,
science and technology power is similar in that the development of
science and technology is driven by the same forces as economic growth.
Like new economic products, services, and methods of operation,
[**s**cience and **t**echnology power relies upon the ingenuity of human
actors predicting and anticipating future trends]{.underline},
possibilities, and human behavior.
**[[Innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, iteration, [[and
**competitiveness** are fundamental]{.mark} catalysts for the continued
evolution and growth]{.underline} of both. The rapid proliferation and
subsequent use of innovative technologies across the world quickly
equalizes both the national security advantage and the economic
advantage they provided their inventor. Economic power, like national
security technology, is a key element of a country's warfighting
capability -- industrial might, strength in quality production, and
capable infrastructure are crucial facets of a country's ability to
mobilize and project force. A fundamental difference between economic
power and science and technology power, however, is competition. While
economies naturally compete, there is incentive for states to specialize
in the economic product or service most suited for it -- their
comparative advantage. [Competing economies are not actively
incentivized to counter the economic specialization of their rivals.
With science and technology power for national security]{.underline}
use, however, [states]{.underline} decidedly [hope to actively and
explicitly counter the relative advantage of their
adversaries]{.underline}. Like diplomatic power, [**s**cience and
**t**echnology has a "**soft power" element**; other states and their
societies may be influenced or compelled to action by the]{.underline}
might, [prestige, or cultural and technological hegemony of a
country]{.underline} in possession of highly advanced and capable
technologies.\[xix\] Diplomatic power occasionally experiences the same
issue of science and technology policy in being blinded to unpredicted
or external trends in the social, cultural, and economic spheres. The
power of diplomacy, for example, did not anticipate and struggled to
deal with the cultural, social, and political circumstances that led to
a breakdown of order in post-invasion Iraq; just as national security
technology was unprepared for the guerilla warfare of the Iraqi
insurgency. Diplomatic power and science and technology power differ,
though, in the fields of innovation and evolution. Whereas the military
regime is constantly evolving and occasionally being upended by
revolutions in security technology and associated doctrine, the
Westphalian diplomatic order has remained largely similar through
centuries -- even as it has grown gradually more complex and
interconnected. States do not tend seek to outcompete each other in the
diplomatic sphere through revolutionary new approaches to diplomacy;
negotiations, sanctions, deals, bi- and multilateral agreements, and the
like have remained consistent "doctrines" employed by states in their
dealings with international friends and foes. Science and Technology
Power's Present and Future Importance To return to Vannevar Bush's
assertion over half a century ago, science and technology is crucially
important for a states' economic growth and prosperity, the wellbeing of
its citizens, and national security. This remains absolutely the case
today. [Despite the challenges facing innovation]{.underline} in the
face of unanticipated adversaries and the proliferation of advanced,
equalizing technologies among adversarial states and non-state actors,
[science and technology provides the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates' **[unrivaled]{.underline}** levels of security
and **[military hegemony]{.underline}**. [[With]{.underline}]{.mark} the
appearance of **[[significant]{.mark} [global
challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- [refugee crises, environmental
degradation, the possible [emergence of a]{.mark}]{.underline} bi- or
[[**multi-polar world** characterized by]{.mark} states
with]{.underline} rough or equal **[[tech]{.mark}nological
[parity]{.mark}]{.underline}**, to name a few -- [the **future
importance of [science and technology]{.mark} power** [cut]{.mark}ting
[across all aspects of national]{.mark} [security]{.mark}
will]{.underline} undoubtedly [**redouble**. Science and technology and
its application as an element of]{.underline} the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates' [national power will
need to be directed to address these challenges]{.underline}. While the
exact characteristics that will define domestic and foreign national
security technologies of the future -- not to mention the economic and
social -- remain uncertain, [[the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[cannot afford to permit its current
tech]{.mark}nological [advantage]{.mark} [to slip]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Indeed, [as revision states such as China continue to develop their
technologies to]{.underline} directly [counter]{.underline} the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates' [capabilities, [it
will]{.mark}]{.underline} likely [[become]{.mark} an
**[imperative]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the country [[to]{.mark} **more
actively engage in and support**]{.underline} the
**[[develop]{.mark}ment of innovative [new]{.mark} security
[tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}** and doctrines --
[[lest]{.underline}]{.mark}, as history would suggest, [the
**[international order]{.mark} again [be upended]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### Prevents global nuclear war

**Henricksen 17** -- emeritus senior fellow at the Hoover Institution
(Thomas, "Post-American World Order," Hoover,
<http://www.hoover.org/research/post-american-world-order>)

The [[tensions stoked by]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[assertive
regimes]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Kremlin or Tiananmen Square [[could
**spark**]{.mark} **a political or military incident** that might set
off [a chain reaction leading to a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[large-scale
war]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Historically, powerful rivalries nearly
always lead to at least skirmishes, if not a full-blown war. [The
anomalous [Cold War]{.mark} era]{.underline}
**[[spared]{.underline}]{.mark}** the United States and Soviet Russia a
direct conflict, largely from concerns that one would trigger a
**[[nuclear exchange destroying]{.underline}]{.mark}** both states and
much of [**[the world]{.mark}**. Such a [repetition **might**
reoccur]{.mark} in the unfolding]{.underline} three-cornered
[geopolitical world]{.underline}. It seems safe to acknowledge that an
ascendant China and a resurgent Russia will persist in their
geo-strategic ambitions. What Is To Be Done? The first marching order is
to dodge any kind of perpetual war of the sort that George Orwell
outlined in "1984," which engulfed the three super states of Eastasia,
Eurasia, and Oceania, and made possible the totalitarian Big Brother
regime. A long-running Cold War-type confrontation would almost
certainly take another form than the one that ran from 1945 until the
downfall of the Soviet Union. What prescriptions can be offered in the
face of the escalating competition among the three global powers? First,
[[by **staying militarily and economically strong**, the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[will]{.mark}
have the resources to [deter]{.mark}]{.underline} its peers' hawkish
behavior that might otherwise trigger a **[[major
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Judging by the history of the Cold War,
[[the]{.mark} coming [strategic chess match]{.mark} with Russia and
China [will prove tense]{.mark} and
demanding]{.underline}---[[since]{.underline}
**[all]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the [countries boast nuclear
arms]{.mark}]{.underline}** and long-range ballistic missiles. Next, the
United States should widen and sustain willing coalitions of partners,
something at which America excels, and at which China and Russia fail
conspicuously. [[There can be **little**]{.mark} **room for
[error]{.mark}** in]{.underline} fraught **[crises [among
nuclear]{.mark}-weaponized]{.underline}** and **[[hostile
powers]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Short- and long-term standoffs are
likely, as they were during the Cold War. Thus, the playbook, in part,
involves a waiting game in which each power looks to its rivals to
suffer grievous internal problems which could entail a collapse, as
happened to the Soviet Union.

**Curi 7/9** -- Maria, reporter for Inside U.S. Trade, "Kudlow:
Administration waiting for Pelosi\'s nod before submitting USMCA bill",
World Trade Online from Inside U.S. Trade, 7/9/19,
<https://insidetrade.com/daily-news/kudlow-administration-waiting-pelosis-nod-submitting-usmca-bill>
//JSL

Tuesday marked the first day the Trump administration could legally send
a U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement implementing bill to Capitol Hill, but
National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said [the [draft
legislation was unlikely to be submitted before]{.mark} House Speaker
Nancy [Pelosi]{.mark}]{.underline} (D-CA) [[gave the go-ahead. U.S.
T]{.mark}rade [Rep]{.mark}resentative Robert Lighthizer h[as been
working with Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark} in Congress [to address their
concerns]{.mark} with the deal before taking it to a vote]{.underline}.
Pelosi in late June said she hoped the agreement could be re-opened only
to address enforcement issues, though U.S., Mexican and Canadian
officials have all said they do not want to restart talks. "[Lighthizer
has said that we will submit formal legislation when she gives a green
light on the vote," Kudlow said]{.underline} during a CNBC event on
Tuesday, referring to Pelosi. "So, [the two of them are working rather
well together, and]{.underline} I think **[[the outcome's going to be
extremely positive]{.underline}]{.mark}**." Citing Kudlow's comment,
[Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley]{.underline} (R-IA)
[said on Tuesday that the timing was up to Pelosi.]{.underline} "I think
that [there's \... respect for this legislative process and the
importance of Pelosi involved in this process, not to do anything to
upset her timetable," Grassley told reporters]{.underline} on Tuesday.
["[The White House is not going to" send the deal to Congress "without
counseling with her,"]{.mark}]{.underline} Grassley added. President
Trump told reporters in May that while Lighthizer was "waiting to get
the okay" from Pelosi, "we're at a point where we're just going to have
to send it in. It's all ready." Lighthizer said Pelosi would "like to
have two weeks to get to know the bill," Trump said then, adding, "I
think that's a long time. I think it's a \-- it's a do-nothing Congress.
The Democrats have done nothing in the House." Trump also claimed that
Pelosi did not understand the deal. [In addition to the formation of a
working group of House Democrats to negotiate with
Lighthizer]{.underline} in four key areas \-- environment, labor,
enforcement and pharmaceuticals \-- [Pelosi has said, **["We have been
on a path to yes"]{.mark}** on USMCA]{.underline}.
[[Kudlow]{.underline}]{.mark} on Tuesday [[praised Pelosi for her
willingness to work with the administration on the
deal]{.underline}.]{.mark} While Trump administration officials have
said they want USMCA ratified before Congress leaves for August recess,
Kudlow and Grassley both suggested that may not happen. Kudlow said he
hoped the deal would be taken to a vote this summer but added that "It
could stretch on to the autumn. I think it'll be sooner than that, but
it's up to her \[Pelosi\], not me." "When you get into July and it
hasn't \-- we don't see movement in it, it might be fair to say that
getting this done before August is unlikely, but this is perfectly
doable in the fall, if it's early fall," Grassley said. "My preference
was to do it before August, but fall is doable. If the House sends us a
bill, we can quickly pass it." Lighthizer and the Democrats assigned to
a USMCA labor working group will meet on Thursday, Politico reported.
The first official meeting between the working group and Lighthizer was
held in late June. Members of the New Democrat Coalition, a largely
pro-trade faction, this week warned USTR against sending the deal to
Congress prematurely. [[Mexico has already ratified]{.mark}
USMCA]{.underline}. [Mexican Under Secretary for North
America]{.underline} Jesús Seade on Tuesday [said [the
U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline} Commerce Department's preliminary
[[determination to impose]{.mark} countervailing [duties]{.mark} on
Mexican]{.underline} fabricated structural [steel]{.underline} this week
[[would not interfere]{.mark} with USMCA]{.underline}. U.S. tariffs on
steel and aluminum imports had presented a major roadblock to the
ratification of the deal in Mexico and Canada, though they have since
been lifted. Seade noted that the Commerce decision this week was
unrelated.

#### Will pass -- no 2020 pressure, Mexico and Canada generating momentum and Trump efforts to satisfy dem concerns

**Daniel 7/05** -- Frank Jack Daniel ("Mexico and U.S. try new trade fix
to win over Democrats: official", Reuters, 7/05/2019,

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) [- [Mexico is working closely
with]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. Trade Representative Robert [[Lighthizer
to close a loophole]{.mark} in the new North American trade deal, [aimed
at satisfying demands of U.S. Democratic lawmakers for tougher labor and
environmental provisions]{.mark}, a senior Mexican official
said.]{.underline} The United States, Mexico and Canada signed the
United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) last November, to replace
the North American Free Trade Agreement that governs more than \$1.2
trillion of mutual trade, but implementation is subject to ratification
by lawmakers in all three countries. Mexico's deputy foreign minister
for North America, Jesus Seade, said the proposal he was working on with
[Lighthizer was focused on closing a loophole in the trade deal's
dispute resolution mechanism. Democrats]{.underline} in the U.S.
Congress, largely in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives,
[have threatened to stall on ratification until their concerns are
met.]{.underline} The new trade deal to replace NAFTA had come at the
behest of Republican U.S. President Donald Trump. Henry Connelly, a
spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, did not comment on the
substance of negotiations. He said [labor and enforcement provisions of
the USMCA are a key concern of House Democrats]{.underline}. "The
speaker continues to work with her caucus and the USTR to strengthen
these critical areas of the proposed agreement," Connelly said. Seade
said as the deal now stands, the United States could start a formal
trade dispute if Mexico was exporting a product made under labor
conditions it considered unfair and contrary to the rules in the pact.
However, he said, a loophole meant Mexico could theoretically block a
dispute panel from being created. "There is a gap in the dispute
resolution system," he told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. "We
are trying to find a way to plug that gap." Earlier this year Mexico
passed a law that strengthens the rights of trade unions, partly to
comply with requirements in the USMCA. Mexico's weak labor laws meant
that for decades the country has had few independent unions, leading to
low wages that both Trump and Democrats blame for excessive offshoring
and a loss of U.S. jobs under NAFTA. Seade said Mexico did not want to,
and was not going to, re-open USMCA. Instead, he said, the gap could be
closed through supplementary measures, "to make sure that if the United
States government wants to initiate a panel against Mexico on labor
standards," it can do so. Canada also opposes reopening the deal. Last
week, senior U.S. Democratic lawmaker Earl Blumenauer said Canada and
Mexico may be open to a limited renegotiation of aspects of the
agreement to satisfy U.S. lawmakers' concerns. Blumenauer, who chairs
the trade subcommittee of the House of Representatives Ways and Means
Committee, said the trade agreement could be modified to address
specific concerns, but he was skeptical about using side agreements,
saying they had proven problematic in the current NAFTA pact among the
three nations. Lighthizer's office did not immediately respond to a
request for comment about the talks with Mexico. In June, Lighthizer
told a Senate panel that he was willing to work with members "to make
(USMCA) even better." TICKING CLOCK **[Time is short for ratifying the
pact before the U.S. Congress enters its summer recess on July 27. When
Congress returns in September, [some Mexican officials worry that
politics around the U.S. 2020 presidential race will make it harder for
Congress to agree. Canada's parliament is seen as less of an
obstacle]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Mexico has already ratified the deal.
Asked about Mexico's plan[**, [a Canadian government source noted
that]{.mark}** Prime Minister Justin **[Trudeau]{.mark}**]{.underline}
and others "[**[have engaged with Dem]{.mark}**ocrat**[s]{.mark}** \...
to talk about the new NAFTA and why it's good for working people, which
is what they care about."]{.underline} [Asked whether Canada would work
with Democrats to include new guarantees]{.underline}, the source, who
requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation, replied:
"No, we are not looking to do that." Trudeau's office did not
immediately respond to a request for comment about the dispute mechanism
plan. The ongoing talks between Mexico, **[[Lighthizer and Pelosi had
progressed enough that even if ratification did not come until after
Congress' summer recess, positions were close enough for that not to be
a major problem]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Seade said. Blumenauer last week
said there was "no way" a vote would be possible before the August
recess, but that Congress would continue to work on it in the autumn.

### Will Pass -- Side Letters

#### Dem leadership is working to getting "yes" -- side letters can resolve outstanding concerns

labor. He was previously a Washington correspondent for Investor\'s
Business Daily. (Sean, "USMCA progressing through \'side letters\':

AS)

Democratic congressional leaders and the Trump administration officials
are inching towards an agreement on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on
trade, one GOP leader said Tuesday. Though progress on the trade deal is
slow, [Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley
said]{.underline}, [[Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark} [are warming]{.mark} up
[to]{.mark} the idea of adding [side agreements]{.mark} to the trade
deal, [something they]{.mark} had [resisted
earlier]{.mark}.]{.underline} \"[You cannot open it up for going back to
the negotiating table]{.underline} with the governments of Canada and
Mexico, [but you could do what we have done with a lot of free trade
agreements. We do what we call \'side letters\' and \'annexes\' that
kind of state the position of the U.S., how we expect the agreement to
be carried out.]{.underline} We could do that[. [Pelosi and her party
are really interested]{.mark} in doing some of those
things,]{.underline} along the lines of environment, labor and
enforcement,\" the Iowa Republican told reporters. Changes could be
tricky, as Mexico has already passed USMCA through its legislature and
doesn\'t want to have to a second time. Canada\'s Parliament, meanwhile,
is in recess, but Grassley said he had been assured by Prime Minister
Justin Trudeau\'s government that they had the necessary votes to pass
the agreement. That could change if the deal was changed though. Neither
government wants to reopen talks at this point. House Speaker Nancy
[[Pelosi]{.underline}]{.mark}, D-Calif., [is under serious
pressure]{.underline}, Grassley said, because while most Democrats want
to pass the deal she also has to work with several members that have
serious reservations regarding it. Pelosi had previously called for
opening USMCA up to full renegotiations. Asked if Pelosi was now saying
the deal needed more extensive tweaks to placate skeptical Democratic
colleagues and to be able to say to them she at least tried to reopen
negotiations, Grassley replied, \"Yes to both questions.\" \"I think
[she [is committed to getting to yes]{.mark}, but she has]{.underline}
so [many new members]{.underline} she has to make them comfortable with
it,\" Grassley said, adding that [[U.S. T]{.mark}rade
[Rep]{.mark}resentative Robert Lighthizer [is working with Democrats to
find a way to thread this needle]{.mark}. \"He thinks he can make
arrangements to satisfy they them,\" the senator said.]{.underline}
Pelosi\'s office did not immediately respond to a Washington Examiner
inquiry. [Side agreements]{.underline} that patch up trade deals [are a
common tool of negotiators]{.underline}, notes Gary Hufbauer,
nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International
Economics. \"[That has become the normal procedure ever since NAFTA was
ratified with side letters back in 1993.]{.underline} [The negotiators
always assert there will be **no changes to the agreed
text**]{.underline} but to get congressional ratification they agree to
just those changes that buy enough votes for ratification,\" he told the
Washington Examiner. USMCA would replace the North American Free Trade
Agreement. [[Democrats]{.underline}]{.mark}, including Pelosi, have
[argued that the USMCA lacks sufficient enforcement
mechanisms]{.underline} and have previously called on the administration
to reopen talks with Mexico and Canada . [In recent weeks however,
Democrat [have signaled]{.mark} they will settle for less than that.
Rep. Earl Blumenauer, who chairs the Ways and Means subcommittee for
trade, told reporters last week [that **only minor changes were
needed**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} "[It doesn't have to be a
renegotiation of the agreement by the three countries]{.underline} ...
So, no, I don't think we are talking about starting from scratch," said
the Oregon Democrat. Meanwhile, [Canada has signaled that]{.underline}
while renegotiations were out of the question, [they were open to
something short of that that would alter USMCA.]{.underline} \"We
recognize, however, that the U.S. is going through its process and we
remain alert to potential challenges and opportunities that may come
through that process,\" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told
reporters late last month.

Speaker Nancy [Pelosi says the time is right, a top Trump administration
official said]{.underline} today. \"\[U.S. Trade Representative Robert\]
[Lighthizer has said that we will submit formal legislation when she
gives the green light on the vote,\"]{.underline} chief White House
economic adviser Larry [Kudlow said]{.underline} in an interview at
CNBC\'s Capital Exchange event. Although Kudlow quoted Lighthizer,
Lighthizer\'s office has not responded to repeated questions in recent
days about whether the Trump administration could send the implementing
legislation to Congress this week, now that lawmakers have returned from
the Fourth of July break. The reason that question was being asked is
because the administration sent its draft Statement of Administration
Action for implementing the USMCA to Congress on May 30, and the 2015
trade promotion authority law requires that document be submitted to
Congress at least 30 days before the administration sends the
implementing legislation. Once the administration sends the legislation,
Congress is required to vote on the agreement with 90 days. However, the
usual first step is to send a draft implementing bill to get input from
Congress before a final bill is sent. [**[Kudlow praised Pelosi for her
willingness to work with Lighthizer]{.underline}** [to address a number
of concerns about the trade deal raised by

### Will Pass -- AT 232

#### The removal of Section 232 tariffs has cleared the way for USMCA passage

**Kirby 5/17** -- Jen, Foreign and National Security Reporter, "Trump
lifts steel and aluminum tariffs on Mexico and Canada", Vox, 5/17/19,
<https://www.vox.com/2019/5/17/18629556/trump-steel-aluminum-tariffs-canada-mexico-usmca>
//JSL

It's gotten a little lost in the intensifying trade war with China, but
President Donald Trump's steep tariffs on all imported steel and
aluminum, first applied in March 2018, remain in place. But now Canada
and Mexico will get a reprieve, as [the US has reached a deal to lift
tariffs on steel and aluminum]{.underline} coming from those two
countries. **[This eliminates a huge hurdle to the ratification
of]{.underline}** the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement
(**[USMCA]{.underline}**), the revised version of NAFTA. The US struck a
deal with Canada and Mexico that would increase enforcement to ensure
cheap Chinese imports don't make their way into the US market. The
tariffs are to be lifted no later than 48 hours after the agreement was
officially announced. Just to recap: In March 2018, the Trump
administration placed a 25 percent tariff on steel and a 10 percent
tariff on aluminum imports --- though Trump delayed putting them on
Canada and Mexico until later that spring. Trump imposed the tariffs
under the authority of Section 232, a provision of the Trade Expansion
Act of 1962 that gives the president power to block or restrict imports
for national security reasons. While getting steel and aluminum from
close allies like Canada and Mexico might not seem like a national
security threat, the Trump administration was using some very creative
maneuvering to essentially boost the domestic US steel industry and
punish China. But the tariffs ended up hitting US allies the hardest
because China isn't actually a huge exporter of steel to the US, in part
because the US already has other restrictive policies in place against
cheap Chinese steel. For obvious reasons, then, [Canada and Mexico
bristled at the tariffs, and it became a major sticking point during the
NAFTA renegotiations last year.]{.underline} Canada in particular was
deeply insulted by the national security justification, as it has long
been one of America's closest defense allies and its troops have fought
alongside American forces in Afghanistan and elsewhere. But [even after
all three countries struck a revised NAFTA deal]{.underline} --- which
Trump renamed the USMCA --- in October (and later signed it in
November), [the US kept those tariffs in place. That stalled the USMCA's
ratification, including here in the US, where both Republican and
Democratic lawmakers wanted to see those tariffs removed before they
would consider the updated trade deal.]{.underline} "Canadian and
Mexican trade officials may be more delicate in their language, but
they're diplomats. I'm not," Senate Finance Committee Chair Chuck
[Grassley]{.underline} (R-IA) [wrote]{.underline} in a Wall Street
Journal op-ed last month. ["If these tariffs aren't lifted, USMCA is
dead. There is no appetite in Congress to debate USMCA with these
tariffs in place."]{.underline} Now, Canada, Mexico, and the US Congress
finally get their wish. "The White House got the message, loud and
clear, that if they wanted a chance to get USMCA passed, they had to get
rid of these steel and aluminum tariffs," Bruce Heyman, who served as US
ambassador to Canada from 2014 to 2017, told me. Mexico and Canada are
expected to lift their retaliatory tariffs now that this deal is in
place too. The tariff issue has apparently been solved. What's next for
USMCA? [The lifting of these tariffs removes perhaps the biggest
obstacle to the passing of USMCA]{.underline}, but other hurdles remain.
Canada has a short window to pass the USMCA this year --- its Parliament
adjourns June 21, after which everyone will head home to campaign for
federal elections in October. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is also
beleaguered by scandal, and he and his Liberal Party are struggling in
the polls. But on Friday, Trudeau celebrated the end of tariffs as a
major win, saying that Canada "stood firm and would not back down until
we achieved today's outcome." He might look to solidify that victory and
get the USMCA through Parliament as soon as possible. Mexico, meanwhile,
has already moved to pass labor laws last month that will help it comply
with the new standards in the USMCA, which ameliorated some concerns
Democrats and unions in the US had about the new trade deal. But some
concerns remain: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other House Democrats
have made clear that they want strong enforcement to those labor
provisions, along with some beefing up of environmental protections and
drug provisions. Pelosi has said these can't be dealt with in side
letters or legislation and need to be worked out in the main deal
itself, but the Trump administration, Mexico, and Canada have absolutely
no appetite to reopen negotiations on the agreement. [The Trump
administration's top trade official, Robert Lighthizer, has upped his
outreach with Democrats on Capitol Hill]{.underline}. And this week,
[**all sides seemed hopeful** that the administration and House
Democrats could reach some sort of resolution to get the USMCA through
Congress.]{.underline} This would undoubtedly deliver Trump a major win
with the 2020 election in sight --- even though Trump exaggerates the
differences between NAFTA and the USMCA, which is really just an updated
and upgraded version of the original trade deal. But [Democrats might be
more willing to deliver a victory to Trump this August]{.underline}
rather than once the 2020 campaign season is fully underway. And if they
can successfully strengthen enforcement for labor and environmental
standards, then they'll get a win out of it too.

WASHINGTON/OTTAWA (Reuters) - [The United States struck
deals]{.underline} on Friday [to lift tariffs on steel and aluminum
imports from Canada and Mexico]{.underline}, the three governments said,
[**removing a major obstacle to legislative approval of a new North
American trade pact.** The separate agreements]{.underline}, which will
not impose U.S. quotas on Canadian and Mexican metals shipments, [will
also eliminate Mexican and Canadian retaliatory tariffs on a broad range
of U.S. products, including pork, beef and bourbon.]{.underline} The
United States and Canada said their agreement will be implemented by
Sunday afternoon, and includes new curbs aimed at preventing dumped
steel and aluminum from China and other countries from entering the U.S.
market via Canada. President Donald Trump had imposed the global
"Section 232" tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum in March 2018
on national security grounds, invoking a 1962 Cold War-era trade law.
Both Canada and Mexico argued for 14 months that their metals industries
posed no security threat as their economies are integrated with the
United States, and challenged the tariffs before the World Trade
Organization. ["This is just pure good news for Canadians," Canadian
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters]{.underline} after
announcing the deal to workers at Stelco Holdings Inc's steel mill in
Hamilton, Ontario. Stelco shares soared 11 percent on the news, while
top U.S. steelmaker Nucor fell 3.1 percent and U.S. Steel Corp, which
had seen massive profit improvement because of the tariffs, fell 1.2
percent. Spokesmen for U.S. Steel and Nucor, which had advocated for
maintaining strong tariff protections, could not be reached for comment.
TRADE DEAL VOTE [The metals tariffs were a **major irritant** for Canada
and Mexico and **had caused them to halt progress toward ratification**
the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement]{.underline}, the trilateral trade
deal to replace the 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement.
[U.S. lawmakers with constituents suffering from Canadian and Mexican
retaliation]{.underline}, including Senate Finance Committee Chairman
Chuck Grassley, [also said they would not consider a USMCA vote with the
tariffs in place.]{.underline} After the deal, Grassley tweeted: "Thank
u Mr President for really helping the farmers of Iowa w this important
step in USMCA. w lifting metal tariffs \@realdonaldtrump just proved he
can deliver on negotiations. China ought to take note/start dealing in
good faith & take Pres Trump seriously." [Trudeau said Canada would now
work with the United States on the timing of USMCA ratification and said
he was optimistic Canada would be "be able to move forward well in the
coming weeks".]{.underline} U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said he would
meet with Trudeau in Ottawa on May 30 to discuss "advancing"
ratification. [Several U.S. Democrats applauded removal of the
tariffs]{.underline}, but said USMCA was not yet ready for their
support. "When it comes to the new agreement, House Democrats continue
to have a number of substantial concerns related to labor, environment,
enforcement, and access to affordable medicines provisions. Those issues
still need to be remedied," said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman
Richard Neal. Neal added that the deal does not address global steel
overcapacity and criticized Trump's handling of trade negotiations with
China, which deteriorated significantly in the last two weeks. Trump,
speaking to realtors in Washington, called the pact "a fantastic deal
for our country" and said Congress would hopefully approve the USMCA
quickly. "Then the great farmers and manufacturers and steel plants will
make our economy even more successful than it already is." Jesus Seade,
[Mexico's deputy foreign minister for North America, said the deal
"measurably increases the probability" the USMCA will be
approved]{.underline} before the U.S. Congress' summer break in August.
Some U.S. lawmakers say passage would become more difficult after the
recess due to budget battles expected in the fall and increased 2020
presidential campaign activity.

Republican lawmakers, Chuck Grassley, who urged the President to rethink
this and adamantly opposed this move. \[14:05:00\] And even in the White

### AT Debt Ceiling Thumps

#### No issues with debt ceiling---Republican and Trump cooperation goes a long way

**Bolton & Elis 19** (Alexander, senior reporter, and Niv, reporter
focusing on economic and spending issues, *The Hill,* "Congress, White
House near deal on spending, debt limit," published May 21^st^, 2019,
<https://thehill.com/policy/finance/444918-congress-white-house-near-deal-on-spending-debt-limit>,
accessed 7/10/19, JME.)

[Congressional leaders and senior White House officials are on a path to
reach a deal to increase spending caps over the next two years and raise
the debt ceiling]{.underline} beyond the 2020 election. The [spending
talks]{.underline}, which earlier this month seemed hopelessly stalled,
[have new momentum after]{.underline} Senate Majority Leader Mitch
[McConnell]{.underline} (R-Ky.) [and]{.underline} Senate Appropriations
Committee Chairman Richard [Shelby]{.underline} (R-Ala.) [made personal
appeals to President Trump in recent days]{.underline}. "I had a really
good session with the president, just the two of us, about a week ago
about the options available to us when it comes to government spending
over the next two years," McConnell told reporters on Tuesday. "[A
negotiated agreement with the House Democrats is the best of three
alternatives]{.underline}, the other two being arguing back and forth
over the length of a \[continuing resolution\] for God only knows how
long, or a sequester that hits defense with about a \$71 billion cut at
the end of the year," he added. Shelby said he delivered a similar
message to Trump during a meeting Monday afternoon. Acting White House
budget director Russ [Vought had signaled to congressional negotiators
in April that the president would be willing to accept a yearlong
stopgap measure in the absence of a spending deal]{.underline}. More
recently, White House officials mulled a one-year deal instead of a
two-year agreement. "I've been to a lot of these meetings over the years
--- and I don't want to be too forward-leaning in predicting an
agreement, but it seems to me without exception everyone would like to
\[make one\]," McConnell said Tuesday. "The agreement would be a
two-year caps deal, which would allow us to go forward" with the
appropriations process, he added. [**McConnell's optimism even surprised
his Republican colleagues** when he briefed them on the status of the
talks during a closed-door lunch meeting. "His normal way of operating
is not to be overly optimistic, and he struck an optimistic
tone]{.underline}," said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), a member
of the Appropriations Committee. Congress's top four leaders --- Speaker
Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), McConnell, Senate Democratic Leader Charles
Schumer (N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) ---
met with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, acting White House chief of
staff Mick Mulvaney and Vought in Pelosi's office Tuesday. After meeting
for more than two hours in the morning, they reconvened at 4:15 p.m.
McConnell had told reporters at lunchtime that negotiators hoped to
clinch a deal by the end of the day, but the afternoon meeting broke up
without a final agreement. One potential sticking point is a
disagreement over how much to increase funding levels for defense
programs compared to nondefense domestic programs. "There are still some
significant issues outstanding, particularly the domestic-side spending
issues --- things like health care, infrastructure and things that
average middle-class folks need," Schumer said Tuesday afternoon.
[Democrats]{.underline} later described the meetings in less optimistic
terms than McConnell. They [praised it as a good start but said there's
still a lot of work left to do. "**When**]{.underline} President
[**Trump shut down the government** and our Republican friends went
along with that, **it didn't serve them very well**. So I think **that's
what's pushing them to a serious negotiation**]{.underline}," Schumer
said. GOP leaders in Congress see the chief benefit of a two-year deal
as taking the prospect of another government shutdown off the table.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said removing the shutdown threat is
"really big," and that the prospect of passing a string of stopgap
spending measures in the absence of a longer-term deal would be
"devastating to the military." Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) said she had
concerns about adding to the federal deficit but warned "the only other
recourse is then continuing resolutions, which kill us all, and possible
government shutdowns, which we don't want to do." Fiscal hawks
criticized the emerging deal as something that would further swell
annual deficits. "Any deal to increase spending caps without offsets
should be a non-starter," said Maya MacGuineas, president of the
Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. "Extending last year's
budget-busting cap increases could add more than \$2 trillion in debt
over the next decade at a time when debt is already projected to rise to
historic highs." A spending deal also would solve the politically
uncomfortable problem of the federal government running out of borrowing
authority later this year. The Treasury Department has been using
"extraordinary measures" to extend federal borrowing authority since the
government hit its debt limit in early March. The deadline for
addressing the debt ceiling is projected to fall in September or
October. Analysts say that if the debt ceiling is not addressed by
October, the government will default on its debt, a circumstance that
would likely spark chaos in financial markets. McConnell and Schumer
both said Tuesday that raising the debt limit would be part of the
spending deal. The White House in April floated the idea of moving
quickly on a debt-limit increase, even in the absence of a spending-caps
deal, but now has signaled willingness to bundle the two items. House
Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), who was briefed on the
meeting, said that as far as he knew, nobody was opposed to raising the
debt ceiling. "I know Mnuchin wants it, and we certainly want it," he
said, referring to inclusion of a debt-ceiling increase in a spending
deal. Negotiators are likely to settle on a numerical increase, as
opposed to the previous practice of suspending the ceiling for a certain
period of time, Yarmuth said. He added that [there seemed to be some
consensus among negotiators about setting overall defense spending at
\$733 billion, \$17 billion below the administration's
request]{.underline}. Trump had initially proposed keeping the statutory
2020 spending caps in place, which would have led to a roughly 12
percent cut in discretionary spending. But the president also proposed
indirectly increasing defense spending by adding billions to a defense
account that is not constrained by budget caps, bringing the defense
total to \$750 billion while slashing nondefense to \$567 billion. House
Democrats set their own funding numbers for their spending bills ---
\$733 billion for defense, \$664 billion of which would be set under the
statutory cap --- and \$639 billion for nondefense, with \$631 billion
of that amount falling under the cap.

#### Unified Republican message means there won't be a fight

*Bloomberg,* "Debt Ceiling, Budget Jitters Prompt McConnell to Broker
Deal," published June 12^th^, 2019,

accessed 7/10/19, JME.)

Top Senate Republicans are urging the White House toward a government
spending and debt limit deal that House Democrats can accept, as
lawmakers \-- and investors \-- cast an increasingly nervous eye toward
looming fiscal deadlines. Majority Leader Mitch [McConnell convened a
high-stakes meeting]{.underline} Wednesday [with]{.underline} Treasury
Secretary Steven [Mnuchin]{.underline}, Acting White House Chief of
Staff Mick [Mulvaney]{.underline}, Senate Appropriations Chairman
Richard Shelby [and other Republicans **to forge a deal** that would
avert another government shutdown and relieve market uncertainty about a
**debt ceiling standoff**. This unified plan would be their opening
offer in talks with congressional Democrats]{.underline}. "We are making
progress on where the Senate wants to go and the White House wants to
go," Shelby said as he left the meeting. He said [Mnuchin offered ideas
that Republicans will take to Democratic leaders.]{.underline} Mnuchin
said [the White House \`\`preference\'\' is to include the debt ceiling
in the deal Congress must strike to fund the government]{.underline}.
Lawmakers this week were optimistic about a budget deal despite the
policy challenges. But any agreement could still be scuttled by
President Donald [Trump]{.underline}, even though he [has the most to
lose from the economic fallout of a debt default or shutdown heading
into the 2020 election]{.underline}. With just over three months left
until the Sept. 30 end of the current fiscal year, the annual budget
process has once again gotten off to a slow start. The Senate has yet to
begin debating its 12 annual spending bills for next year as the
Appropriations Committee waits for congressional leaders to agree on the
overall spending limit. "We're hopeful that we are making progress
toward getting a caps agreement so we can get started with the
Appropriations process," McConnell told reporters after the meeting, in
reference to the budget-caps deal that would set spending levels. The
Democratic-led House, on the other hand, is voting on some of its
spending bills this week, although the policies and level of government
outlays represent progressive Democratic priorities \-- without
bipartisan approval. The first package of four House spending bills,
which includes Defense and totals \$1 trillion, will get a vote this
week. The White House has threatened to veto what it described as an
"attack" on Trump's agenda for, among other things, blocking the
transfer of funds for his border wall.

#### Trump plays nice---no fights

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven [Mnuchin told lawmakers]{.underline} on
Tuesday [that]{.underline} President Donald [Trump is not interested in
holding an increase of the debt ceiling "hostage" to force Congress to
pass funding for a border wall with Mexico]{.underline} or any other
legislation. [Mnuchin]{.underline}, speaking at the U.S. House of
Representatives Committee on Financial Services, [urged Congress to pass
a debt ceiling quickly]{.underline}. A debt ceiling suspension expired
in March, and the Treasury has employed extraordinary measures to
continue to borrow under the limit. The Congressional Budget Office has
estimated that these measures would last until September or October.
[Asked whether a debt ceiling increase would be "held hostage" to
Trump's demand]{.underline}s for funding of a U.S.-Mexico border wall,
[Mnuchin said:]{.underline} "The president has no interest to holding
this hostage to any issue \... [The president would like to have this
passed as soon as we can."]{.underline} Mnuchin also said that he was
comfortable with the United States' ability to sustain its national debt
load based on current growth rates, but the government "has to be
careful" on spending.

#### Debt ceiling negotiations will go through---bipartisan support

[Congress has been here before. Budget and government spending fights
are grand bargains in Congress, and]{.underline} so far, [**Republican
and Democrats want a deal**.]{.underline}"A negotiated agreement with
the House Democrats is the best of three alternatives, the other two
being arguing back and forth over the length of a \[continuing
resolution\] for God only knows how long, or a sequester, which hits
defense with about a \$71 billion cut at the end of the year," McConnell
told reporters earlier this year. [These negotiations almost always go
the same way: Democrats are focused on increasing funding for domestic
programs, while Republicans are zeroed in on increasing military
funding]{.underline}. Democrats say they are fighting for a longstanding
principle of "parity," or increasing both the defense and domestic
budgets by the same dollar amount. "[Democrats are committed to working
on a bipartisan basis to avert devastating cuts]{.underline} of the
sequester," Pelosi and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement
after a White House meeting in May. "We continue to insist that there be
parity in increases between defense and non-defense, and that we
adequately fund critical domestic priorities, including the census and
our commitments to our heroic veterans." These top-line numbers are
important because in addition to avoiding the sequestration, Congress
has to actually start deciding how it will dole out money to different
departments and agencies. And agreeing on budget caps will allow
appropriators to begin putting together a government spending bill to
keep the government open. [The House has started the appropriations
process]{.underline}, the Senate hasn't. In an interview with Vox in
early May, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who sits on the Senate Budget
Committee, said "right now the Congress is working off the president's
budget on military spending." And Politico reported that there was an
expectation that negotiations would work off Trump's requested defense
budget --- a massive boost to \$750 billion. Congress passed a \$716
billion defense budget for fiscal year 2019. The House passed a defense
budget bill with a \$733 billion top line number out of committee this
week, despite Republican efforts to increase that figure. If Democrats
get their way, domestic funding would be increased proportionally.

### I/L -- PC k/t USMCA

#### Trump's pc is key to secure passage

**Leonard 2018**

key to USMCA" December 6, 2018
<https://www.farmprogress.com/farm-policy/trump-s-combative-side-poses-risk-democrats-hold-key-usmca>

[At stake for the president and]{.underline} American l[awmakers is the
fate of a trading bloc with about \$1 trillion in annual
shipments]{.underline} that's lifted some industries while decimating
the workers in others. For Democrats in particular, the deal provides an
opening to demand concessions that favor unions and include a possible
infrastructure investment package. **["[There's no question that there
is a path to passage]{.mark}]{.underline}**," said Edward Alden, senior
fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. "The key for Democrats is
whether the labor unions are prepared at least not to oppose the USMCA.
Without active labor opposition, there will be a significant group of
Democrats prepared to vote for this." Fractious Politics Signed in
Buenos Aires on Nov. 30 after more than a year of intense negotiations,
[**[USMCA is the]{.mark}** [biggest]{.mark} [achievement]{.mark} in
Trump's trade agenda [and its **survival depends on whether the
president can steer the agreement through fractious domestic
politics**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even though it's been signed by all
three countries, it still must be ratified by each nation's legislature
\-- and particularly in the U.S., that's where it can go sideways. U.S.
Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has the tough task of convincing
his boss that he needs to exercise patience with lawmakers who
eventually must approve his deal but are requiring changes. Lighthizer
doesn't have much wiggle room to satisfy a wide range of concerns. He
says he's willing to address demands through the implementing bill that
Congress will vote on, though he ruled out reopening the deal for
negotiations.

#### Trade votes are hard for dems -- passage requires PC

Potential Impact on USMCA Ratification Trump and Lighthizer believe that
[the USMCA's labor and environmental provisions]{.underline}, the
inclusion of wage-levels as a component of Rules of Origin, and the
limitation of ISDS [should contribute to Democratic support of the
agreement,]{.underline} expected to move forward under TPA rules for
congressional approval in March 2019. Certainly, Democrats and
Republicans began to grasp the downside of walking away from the
integrated North American market during the 13 months of NAFTA
renegotiations. However, [trade votes are always difficult for
Democrats]{.underline}, to say nothing of a Trump-branded agreement.
[Hard-to-ignore labor unions and environmental groups are already
agitating for additional concessions]{.underline}. Both to pressure for
passage and to show strength, it is possible that President Trump would
withdraw from the agreement next year under NAFTA Article 2205, starting
a 6-month clock after which the United States may exit the deal. [The
[stark choice between blowing up]{.mark} intertwined North American
[supply chains and]{.mark} taking [a hard trade vote should push
Congress to approve USMCA]{.mark}, though **[with some drama
attached]{.mark}**]{.underline}. House Democrats are already
foreshadowing an effort to revive/reinforce the types of commitments
made in the bipartisan "May 10th Agreement" from 2007, which gave
Democrats cover to vote on Bush-era FTAs. Representative Levin (R-MI),
an original May 10 co-author, has stated, "The challenge became to take
the clear language in May 10, which was a breakthrough, and make it
real." **[[This will take time and political
capital]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But as US farmers and ranchers continue
to suffer under 232 and 301 retaliatory tariffs, [[preserving free trade
in North America should be a]{.mark} (reluctant) [priority]{.mark} of
most lawmakers]{.underline}, despite intense political pressure.
[Republican control of the Senate should help]{.underline}.

We continue to believe that [the USMCA faces a steep climb in
Congress]{.underline}. Senator John [Cornyn]{.underline} (R-Texas), the
second ranking Senate Republican, [spoke positively about the agreement
on the Senate floor, but said]{.underline} on Wednesday that [passing
legislation to implement the deal would be "an uphill fight." Other key
lawmakers have reacted with a mix of guarded optimism and
skepticism.]{.underline} Republicans such as Senator Charles Grassley
(R-Iowa) are suggesting that Congress push to approve an implementing
bill during the "lame duck" window between the midterm election and
January 3, 2019. This would mean that Congress would have to pass the
bill in December --- after the deal is signed on November 30, but likely
before the required economic impact statement of the deal is finished.
This would be an unprecedented move and would likely mean that the bill
would pass on a partisan vote. Ultimately, we believe that [Trump will
need to expend significant time and political capital with Democrats in
order for the agreement to ever pass Congress.]{.underline}

[[The White House is engineering an unusually **by-the-book
approach**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[for selling]{.mark} Congress
on]{.underline} the [replacement]{.underline} deal for
[[NAFTA]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [with the hope of
persuading]{.underline} Speaker Nancy [Pelosi]{.underline} to hold a
vote for the new trade agreement. [[Administration officials have been
organizing]{.mark} dozens of [meetings]{.mark} with]{.underline}
rank-and-file [lawmakers to try to build bipartisan support for the
deal]{.underline}, which restructures trade terms with Canada and
Mexico. [[They're hoping to recapture the success of criminal justice
reform]{.mark} legislation, which marked a rare high-point for White
House-Hill relations]{.underline} and passed Congress last year
following a monthslong behind-the-scenes campaign led by Jared Kushner.
Their goal is to get a vote on the pact by late summer. But their
efforts still may come to nothing: While Pelosi hasn't yet staked out a
definitive position on the agreement, factions of Democrats are already
saying they're not going to vote for it unless there are changes to key
provisions, possibly requiring new negotiations with the two U.S.
trading partners. Plus, Democrats and GOP lawmakers alike are telling
the president they won't consider the deal until he lifts lingering
tariffs on steel and aluminum from Mexico and Canada. "Look, **[[it's
going to be very hard to do this]{.underline}]{.mark}**," said Rep.
Richard Neal, chairman of the influential House Ways and Means
Committee. [With few legislative options on the horizon, [passing the
new pact has taken an outsize importance for]{.mark}]{.underline} the
administration, especially as [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} hones his
reelection message. White House aides said they are aware that the
[divisive politics]{.underline} of the upcoming election [could give
Democrats incentive to reject it]{.underline}. In recent weeks, senior
officials from [the White House]{.underline} and the U.S. Trade
Representative's office [have met with Ways and]{.underline}
[Means]{.underline} Committee members, the [House GOP whip team, the

Blue Dogs. [Administration officials are planning to]{.mark} soon [meet
with the New Democrats]{.mark}, who are widely seen as a key
coalition]{.underline} that will ultimately deliver Democratic votes for
the deal. Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, is
taking the lead in the White House and Deputy U.S. Trade Representative
C.J. Mahoney is the point person at USTR, with Robert Lighthizer, the
administration's lead trade negotiator, regularly meeting with lawmakers
about the issue. [[The strategy stands **in stark contrast**]{.mark}
[with many of the administration's previous dealings]{.mark} with
Capitol Hill]{.underline}, from the failed effort to repeal Obamacare to
the tense negotiations over last year's \$1.3 trillion spending bill.
[[Lawmakers]{.underline}]{.mark} and senior aides [have long
[complained]{.mark} that [the White House lacks a strategy]{.mark} for
working with Congress and hasn\'t done enough to communicate with

"Wyden, Brown pitch USMCA 'labor cooperation' mechanism" April 05, 2019
https://insidetrade.com/daily-news/wyden-brown-pitch-usmca-%E2%80%98labor-cooperation%E2%80%99-mechanism

[The]{.underline} Office of the [[U.S. T]{.mark}rade
[R]{.mark}ep]{.underline}resentative [[is considering a proposal
from]{.underline}]{.mark} Democratic Sens. Ron
[[Wyden]{.mark}]{.underline} (OR) [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} Sherrod
[[Brown]{.underline}]{.mark} (OH) [[aimed at boosting confidence that
Mexico will adhere to]{.mark} labor [commitments]{.mark}]{.underline} in
the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, according to Senate aides. The "Labor
Cooperation and Enforcement Agreement" they are proposing would arm both
the U.S. [and]{.underline} Mexican governments with more effective tools
to detect labor violations in mining and manufacturing sectors and would
"target enforcement actions" against shipments from facilities in
violation of the deal's labor standards, according to the senators\'
offices. Brown and Wyden have discussed the proposal with Mexico\'s
foreign affairs under secretary for North America, Jesús Seade, and the
Mexican ambassador to the U.S., Martha Bárcena, who were on Capitol Hill
for meetings earlier this week. "In those conversations we emphasized
the overlapping interests we have with the \[Mexican\] administration
[to advance workers' rights and unions]{.underline} and how this
proposal will help achieve those common goals," the Senate aides said in
an email. The proposal was first reported by Politico. House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said this week that enforcement issues must be
addressed within the text of the agreement, suggesting the deal must be
re-opened to adequately address widespread Democratic concerns with
USMCA. "I think we are only chatting unless we are enforcing," Pelosi
said Thursday, according to Bloomberg. "I want to see stronger
enforcement language." [The proposal]{.underline} calls for Mexico to
commit to increase the number and training of enforcement personnel,
according to a summary provided by the Senate aides. It
[would]{.underline} include "U.S.-provided capacity-building and joint
initiatives" to [promote]{.underline} the enforcement of [core labor
rights]{.underline} outlined by the International Labor Organization and
would work to ensure "acceptable conditions of work in Mexico," the
summary adds. It would also allow the two governments to "audit and
inspect facilities suspected of violating labor standards." Accordingly,
if facilities are found to be in violation, the U.S. could deny
preferential treatment afforded under the deal for goods from that
facility. "If facilities were found to be in violation, the U.S. could
then take action to deny NAFTA's preferential tariff treatment to goods
imported from that facility. In the case of forced labor, the U.S. could
deny imports from those facilities all together, as is already provided
under U.S. law," the summary states. "Updating NAFTA will only help
American workers if the deal can be enforced," Wyden said in a statement
issued with a summary of the proposal. "Senator Brown and I have a plan
to help Mexico live up to its commitments when it comes to higher labor
standards." Brown argued that "Anti-outsourcing rules are only as strong
as the tools that enforce them. Words on a paper won't stop jobs from
going to Mexico." The aides pointed to similar enforcement tools in
other U.S. trade agreements, including the timber verification provision
used in the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement. They also cited
provisions aimed at "ensuring that textile and apparel imports meet the
requirements that U.S. free trade agreements generally demand."
[[In]{.underline}]{.mark} October [[2017, Lighthizer

### I/L -- Trump PC Works

#### Political capital theory is true for Trump \-\-- [learning curve]{.underline} proves

**Graham 18** -- David, "Trump\'s Quietly Growing List of Victories,"
*The Atlantic*,
<https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/01/what-trump-has-accomplished/550760/>

[Nothing comes easy in the [Trump]{.mark} presidency]{.underline},
[but]{.underline} over the last few months [the White House [has
shown]{.mark}]{.underline} fitful but [[real progress toward]{.mark}
more [effective policymaking]{.mark}]{.underline}. From domestic policy
to foreign affairs, President [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[[notched]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[real victories]{.mark} over the
fall and winter months]{.underline} than during the rest of his
administration combined. This includes the passage of a large tax-cut
package, the long delayed first major legislative achievement of his
presidency. Trump has appointed conservative judges and further cut
regulations. He has fulfilled campaign promises by announcing the end of
the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, recognizing
Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and announcing a plan to move the
U.S. Embassy there from Tel Aviv. He has also presided over the end of
ISIS's territorial control in Syria and Iraq.
[[These]{.underline}]{.mark} and other [victories seem to [reflect a
learning curve]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Most new presidents]{.mark}
manage to [ram through]{.mark} top [priorities in their first
days]{.mark} or months in office, [when]{.mark} their [political capital
is high, but Trump]{.mark} [entered office with little goodwill]{.mark}
and little or no understanding of either policy or the policymaking
process]{.underline}, [as well as a staff largely
inexperienced]{.underline} in either---though proficient at intramural
feuding. There's little indication that [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}
himself has learned much more about policy or legislation, but he has
[[professionalized his White House staff,]{.mark} [creating a more
effective team]{.mark}]{.underline}. The rub is that insofar as the
Trump administration is hitting its stride, it is doing so just as the
prospects for further success dry up. Every few months, I try to look
back on what Trump has accomplished in the intervening period. [[This
is]{.underline}]{.mark} an [[important]{.underline}]{.mark} exercise
[[because coverage of the president is overwhelmingly
negative]{.underline}]{.mark}, largely for reasons of his own making,
and the Russia probe and other scandals tend to obscure more mundane
political action. [[In that context, it's easy for the public to
miss]{.mark} or forget about changes that]{.underline} will
[affect]{.underline} the nation and American
[[policy]{.underline}]{.mark} for years and decades to come. This is not
intended as an assessment of the [[wisdom]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
decisions---of the items included here, some are overwhelmingly
unpopular, and some may end up producing largely negative effects, even
from the perspective of those who advocated them. The point is simply to
measure what the White House is doing. The biggest single accomplishment
for Trump in the time since I last conducted this exercise is the
passage of a suite of tax cuts. In some ways, that bill was a
disappointment. Early on, Trump and GOP leaders were promising an
overhaul of the tax code on a par with the 1986 tax-reform law: A full
rewrite of the tax code, permanent changes, returns that could be filed
on a postcard. The final bill is none of that. Because leaders were
rushing frantically to get a bill passed before Christmas and made
little attempt to attract Democratic votes, they ended up with a
conventional, if large, package of tax cuts. Those cuts overwhelmingly
favor high earners, and changes to individual tax rates will expire in
10 years. But after multiple failed attempts at repealing Obamacare, and
with no other major legislation through Congress, the bar was lowered.
Trump and Republicans showed up a chorus of naysayers who insisted there
was no way a bill could be written and passed by the end of the year.
The resulting bill allowed Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell, and Speaker Paul Ryan to all claim victory, and the cuts for
high earners and corporations fulfill longstanding wishes from GOP
donors and machers. Since Trump signed the law, multiple large companies
have announced raises for employees, many of them citing the new tax
plan as an incentive. Some executives are likely catering to a president
who responds well to flattery and has no hesitations about bullying
companies, while other messages have been tempered (Walmart announced
raises noisily, while quietly laying off thousands of Sam's Club
employees), but Trump has sought to harvest a political dividend.
Elsewhere on the domestic front, Trump has continued to make progress on
his immigration agenda. After multiple attempts and multiple defeats in
court, the Supreme Court in December allowed Trump's travel ban, née
Muslim ban, to take effect while legal challenges continue, a partial
victory nearly a year in the making. The efficacy of the ban has never
been well-demonstrated, but Trump has argued for months it is essential
and now has a version in place. In September, Attorney General Jeff
Sessions announced the end of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals
program, marking the culmination of a promise that Trump made during the
campaign (but had on occasion contradicted since then). Arrests for
illegal border crossings from Mexico, generally a rough proxy for the
number of people attempting to enter the United States, reached their
lowest level since 1971, although that is a continuation of a
pre-existing trend, and Trump persists in exaggerating the size of the
drop. The raw number of deportations has actually dropped from the end
of Barack Obama's term to the start of Trump's, but that is in part
because of fewer crossings. The Trump administration has ramped up
deportations of people already living in the United States, including
with some high-profile moves like a nationwide raid on 7-Elevens. The
San Francisco Chronicle reported this week that federal officials are
planning a sweeping raid in Northern California intended as a brushback
on sanctuary cities. Trump has not succeeded in repealing Obamacare, a
longstanding priority, and after multiple attempts, congressional GOP
leaders have demonstrated that they have little stomach for another try
any time soon. But the president has managed to gradually erode the law,
including a repeal of the individual mandate. Around 3.2 million fewer
people have insurance than did at the start of 2017, and a plurality of
Republicans in an Economist/YouGov poll said the law had been repealed.
The president has also continued to nominate federal judges at a record
clip, and to see them confirmed to the federal bench. He successfully
installed Mick Mulvaney, the head of the Office of Management and
Budget, as interim director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,
from which perch Mulvaney has moved quickly to dismantle regulations on
the financial industry. Abroad, even as Trump struggles with North Korea
policy, strained ties with allies, and a broken relationship with his
secretary of state, the president saw ISIS driven from its territorial
holdings in Iraq and Syria, in large part due to American fighters and
strategy. Trump inherited a fight going well for the U.S. and a strategy
on the way to achieving that, as Obama administration alums like to
point out, but he saw that strategy through. This doesn't mean ISIS is
no longer a threat, but the end of its territorial claims is a major
milestone. In announcing U.S. recognition of Jerusalem and future plans
to move the American embassy there, Trump followed through on a promise
made not just by him but by several predecessors, who backtracked once
in office. Like most choices in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the
move won him both praise and fury. In August, I argued that while Trump
was quietly accomplishing more than was immediately clear, nearly all of
his accomplishments dovetailed with traditional priorities of the
Republican Party---deregulation, judgeships, and the like---while his
own distinctive priorities were stuck in neutral. That remains largely
the case, as exemplified by the tax bill, which eschewed any of the
populist flourishes for which Trump was labeled distinctive in the past.
In his immigration enforcement push, he is matching the rhetoric of many
establishment Republicans while going beyond what Republican presidents
have been willing to do. In sum, the past few months have been the most
productive period of the [[Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark} presidency. Even
if the president has not become an especially effective advocate for
policies, his [staff has become more effective at avoiding the problems
that sank earlier policy attempts]{.underline}. At times, [the White
House [relationship with congressional leaders has]{.mark} even [looked
strong]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [though it's an up-and-down
affair]{.underline}]{.mark}.

<http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/presidential-mandates-arent-real-but-congress-sometimes-acts-as-if-they-are/>

Despite all this subjectivity, [Congress's behavior does seem to shift
when there's lots of mandate talk]{.underline} in the air. [Political
scientists]{.underline} Lawrence [Grossback]{.underline}, David
[Peterson and]{.underline} James [Stimson found that]{.underline}
members of [Congress responded to media cues]{.underline} that a mandate
election had occurred, [deviating from their usual voting
habits]{.underline} for a few months at most. Surprise, these scholars
argue, is the key element in the development of mandate narratives in
the media. The elections of 1964 (for the effect of the presidential
race on Congress), 1980 and 1994, for example, took observers by
surprise and required explanation. The explanation offered by media
observers was that voters had been clear in their desire for party's
agenda to be enacted. [The media interpretations of the election after
the fact created a convincing story about the policy
meaning]{.underline} of the election. [Can presidents themselves
convince Congress that an election carried with it a mandate? I've
looked into this issue with David Peterson, an Iowa State University
professor]{.underline} and co-author of the research mentioned above,
[and we found that when presidents identify the election as a mandate,
members of Congress respond]{.underline}. [Our study covered presidents
from J]{.underline}ohn [F. K]{.underline}ennedy [through]{.underline}
Barack [Obama]{.underline}, [and drew on the research that I did on how
presidents interpret election results in their rhetoric]{.underline}.
Looking at a wide range of presidential remarks,1 I assessed whether
each communication event used the election results to justify what the
president was doing. I found that [presidents interpret elections in a
variety of ways: sometimes as mandates for their own leadership and
judgment, but more often for the issues and governing philosophies they
talked about during the campaign]{.underline}. Contrary to what we might
expect, the final vote shares don't seem to matter.

Programs", August 2015, Legislative Studies Quarterly, 40:3

[The president's legislative program]{.underline},1which is the set of
proposals sent from the president to the legislative branch, **[is
viewed as pivotal in presidential-congressional
relations]{.underline}**. We see evidence of the privileged place [these
requests]{.underline} have in three ways. First, they [shape Congress's
lawmaking agenda]{.underline}. [Over 70% of the president's issue
priorities get congressional consideration, and signiﬁcant legislation
sent by the administration is almost always debated]{.underline}
(Edwards and Barrett 2000;Peterson 1990). Second, [these policy
proposals are traditionally viewed as a tool the president can use to
open policy windows and create more accommodating lawmaking
environments]{.underline}. Kingdon reports that **["no other single
actor in the political system has quite the capability of the president
to set agendas in given policy areas]{.underline}**.. ." (1984, 23).
Third, [these proposals provide cues to legislators about which issues
they can successfully politi-cize by opposing or supporting the
president's policy ideas]{.underline} (Lee 2009).[As the president's
program heavily inﬂuences legislative attention and the level of
partisanship within Congress, it is also crucial to under-standing the
broader policymaking process]{.underline}. To that end, we examine why

### I/L -- Trump PC -- Base Support Key 

#### GOP sticks with Trump because of the base---they're scared he'll back extremist primary opponents---empirics prove

Alexander **Bolton, 3-16**-2019, \"Republicans up for reelection fear
daylight with Trump,\" TheHill,
https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/434337-republicans-up-for-reelection-fear-daylight-with-trump//RS

**[Senate [Republicans]{.mark} who are up for reelection next year [are
sticking as close to]{.mark} President [Trump as
possible]{.mark}]{.underline}**, especially on his signature issue of
illegal immigration and border security. [Even as some Senate
Republicans broke with Trump]{.underline} over his emergency declaration
to build a wall on the Mexican border, [most of those running for
reelection next year backed Trump --- [a sign of their **fear of
Trump-fueled primary opponents**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Only one of the
12 Republicans who voted on Thursday for a Democratic-backed resolution
overturning Trump's emergency declaration is up for reelection next
year: Sen. Susan Collins (R), who has a well-established reputation in
Maine as an independent. Republicans running in other swing states who
arguably might have benefited from distancing themselves from Trump,
such as Sens. Cory Gardner (Colo.), Martha McSally (Ariz.) and Thom
Tillis (N.C.), stuck with him. The tone was set early by Senate Majority
Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). The GOP leader, who is up for
reelection, endorsed Trump's national emergency declaration last month
despite initially warning Trump against the move, according a Feb. 1
Washington Post report. GOP strategists said Republicans have little
choice given the potency of the issue of border security with Trump's
base. "I think what they've seen is the Republican base has been
energized by the issue the last couple years and it's not going away,"
said Chip Saltsman, a Republican strategist. "This issue has really
become a defining issue as you go into the next election cycle," he
added. "[Donald [Trump uses his bully pulpit very well]{.mark}, and he's
brought a lot of energy and focus]{.underline} on this issue, and they
know he's not going to stop talking about it." [The Senate also
delivered a rebuke to Trump on Wednesday when seven Republicans voted to
pass a resolution requiring the president to withdraw U.S. military
support from a Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen]{.underline}. Only
two of the defectors in that vote are up for reelection next year:
Collins and Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.).

https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2017/07/13/why_gop_lawmakers_are_sticking_with_trump_134459.html//RS

[The script has become familiar by now]{.underline}. [[A new
controversy]{.mark}, usually involving Russia, stirs within the White
House, [consumes a news cycle]{.mark} and spills out onto the feet of
congressional Republicans, [leading to the question: When will lawmakers
break from]{.mark} Donald [Trump?]{.mark}]{.underline} While Republican
members of Congress may squirm or wring their hands at the latest news
and take to Twitter to air their grievances about the president,
**[[there is not yet a political incentive to file for
separation]{.underline}]{.mark}** in this marriage---even if it is an
arranged one. Over the course of a chaotic six months of this
presidency, [[Trump\'s approval]{.mark} rating [among Republicans has
remained]{.mark} [consistently strong]{.mark}]{.underline} [a]{.mark}t
around 85 to 90 percent. [While his support nationally hovers around 40
percent]{.underline} and some polls show him losing ground among
independents, [Republicans across the country still back
him]{.underline} [and, [therefore, their representatives in Congress
continue to do so as well.]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[Severing themselves
from Trump would be to alienate his supporters who significantly overlap
with the Republican]{.mark} Party [base]{.mark}.]{.underline}** And as
GOP lawmakers gripe about a stalled or distracted agenda, there is still
a Republican behind the Resolute Desk, ready to enact (most) of the
legislation they send to him. \"I am sitting in the Oval Office with a
pen in hand, waiting for our senators to give it to me,\" Trump said of
the health care bill in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting
Network on Wednesday, warning the Senate majority leader: \"Mitch has to
pull it off.\" **[So long as Trump\'s agenda doesn\'t diverge from that
of Republicans, members of Congress are inclined to see the relationship
through]{.underline}**. \"

#### Trump has pc -- he has total control over the party and strong base support

**Milligan 19** (Susan, political and foreign affairs writer, *US News
and World Report,* "All About That Base," published January 25^th^,

<https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2019-01-25/republicans-stick-with-trump-to-please-the-base>,
accessed 7/5/19, JME.)

[On paper, President Donald Trump ought to have the least amount of
political capital in modern presidential history. The approval numbers
alone would normally lead members of Congress to avoid the president
like he\'s a communicable virus. But **[Trump]{.mark}**, entering the
second half of his first term, **[retains a remarkable level of control
over his party]{.mark}**]{.underline}, even among those he has
personally -- and publicly -- insulted. The extraordinary dynamic is
making it even harder for Congress and the White House to come to some
kind of agreement to end the punishing, monthlong government shutdown
that is now imperiling everything from housing assistance to farmer
support to federal tax refunds. [[\"The party is in]{.mark}
[Trump\'s]{.mark} hip [pocket]{.mark}]{.underline},\" says political
analyst Stu Rothenberg, senior editor of the nonpartisan Inside
Elections. [While Trump is broadly unpopular, \"he remains so popular
within the party that they\'[re afraid]{.mark} [of being seen as his
opponents,]{.mark} or his enemy. The safest thing to do is to get on his
side]{.underline}, and that reduces the likelihood of a primary
opponent,\" Rothenberg adds. [On Capitol Hill, Trump\'s most vocal GOP
critics are largely gone:]{.underline} Sens. Bob Corker of Tennessee and
Jeff Flake of Arizona retired, Sen. John McCain of Arizona died, and
Rep. Mark Sanford of South Carolina lost his primary. Flake, notably,
bowed out of a re-election fight after it was clear he would face a
strong challenge from the right, while Sanford blamed his own loss on
Trump\'s endorsement of his primary opponent. [\"[Trump\'s support among
the most active]{.mark}, self-identified [Republicans has
hovered,]{.mark} at its lowest, [at]{.mark} about [85 percent]{.mark}.\"
And while Republicans grumble privately about the president\'s behavior
or push back on decisions such as the U.S. military withdrawal from
Syria, they have remained almost entirely united when it matters -- on
votes.]{.underline} The Senate, for example, could re-vote on the
funding bills the chamber passed in the last Congress, forcing Trump to
veto them or let them become law, ending the shutdown. But GOP Majority
Leader Mitch McConnell has said there\'s no point in passing legislation
Trump won\'t sign, so has not brought up the bills for votes.

#### Trump has pc -- conservatives know they cannot alienate his base

Darrell **Delamaide**, 1-3-20**17**, \"Trump will play Congress like a
fiddle,\" MarketWatch,
https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-will-play-congress-like-a-fiddle-2017-01-03//RS

We all know the Republicans swept the elections, winning the White House
and retaining control of both houses of Congress. But it is where these
victories came from and how they were made that tells us what will
happen in the two years this 115th Congress will have until midterm
elections in 2018. There is obviously a great deal of overlap between
Trump's campaign pledges and the standing agenda of congressional
Republicans under House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell. But there are also some significant differences --- in
the approach to trade issues and deficit spending, to name just two.
Trump's pledge to maintain and defend Medicare and Social Security is
another important difference. Congressional Republicans may think they
are about to reach the Promised Land, and Washington Post reporter David
Weigel this week neatly summed up the various bills they have vetted on
issues from deregulation to repealing Obamacare that are just waiting
for a president to sign into law. But if Trump has proven anything in
his idiosyncratic campaign, it is that he is hardly just "a Republican
with enough working digits to handle a pen" --- the ideal president once
dreamed of by tax reform activist Grover Norquist. In other words,
[[it's not likely Trump will simply rubber-stamp legislation]{.mark}
that [a Republican]{.mark} Congress [churns out]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Why would someone who trumpets his expertise in negotiation simply give
Congress what it wants? **[[He will hold back]{.mark} on those
signatures [as leverage]{.mark} to get what he wants, especially when it
runs counter to or simply beyond the lawmakers' agenda]{.underline}**.
Salena Zito, a pro-Trump commentator who catapulted to prominence for
her insights into the Trump campaign, reminds us that the key to
understanding the incoming president is his 1987 book, "The Art of the
Deal." Trump voters understood what mainstream media commentators still
haven't grasped --- many of his statements are not ex cathedra
pronouncements on policies but negotiating ploys. And, yes, many of them
are not completely true. "Throughout the book, he is always negotiating,
no matter if he was coming from a full truth or not, didn't matter,"
Zito writes of the 1987 book in the Washington Examiner. "It is always
about the value of what is at stake. In that type of barter,
truthfulness becomes irrelevant, it only has actuality if the deal is
struck and the facts come out." Which brings us back to Congress and how
Trump will deal with it. Even though Republicans retained control of
both houses, Democrats trimmed those majorities even as Clinton won a
commanding plurality in the popular vote for president. The Republican
majority in the Senate went to 52 from 54, out of 100, and to 241 from
247, out of 435 in the House. The electoral upsets that enabled
Republicans to maintain the Senate majority were the victories of Ron
Johnson in Wisconsin and Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania, two Republican
incumbents most pollsters predicted would lose to Democratic
challengers, Russ Feingold and Kathleen McGinty. But [[Trump's
surprising win in those swing states]{.mark} also [lifted]{.mark} the
two [incumbents to an unexpected victory]{.mark}]{.underline}. Had
Clinton's campaign in those states been slightly more effective she
might be the president-elect with Democratic control of the Senate.
Democrats were bound to recapture the Senate seat in Illinois, but they
also won a closely fought battle in New Hampshire, where the popular
governor, Maggie Hassan, defeated Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte. [It
may well have been Ayotte's disavowal of Trump that cost her the margin
of victory. [The lesson]{.mark} here, as with unsuccessful Nevada Senate
candidate Joe Heck, who lost ground after distancing himself from Trump,
is that Republican **[lawmakers need Trump's support to gain voter
favor]{.mark} more than he needs them**]{.underline}. The picture from
the House results is a little less clear-cut. Although every member is
up for re-election every two years, the rate of incumbency victories is
very high. In 2016, 380 of the 393 incumbents seeking re-election won,
for an incumbency rate of 96.7%. According to Ballotpedia, Democrats
tend to gain seats in presidential election years with their higher
voter turnout, while Republicans tend to gain in the midterm elections.
For instance, Democrats gained eight sets in 2012 and 24 in 2008, which
make the net gain of six in 2016 seem relatively small. So Republicans
are likely to make gains in the House in 2018. In the Senate,
Republicans will be defending only eight seats, while Democrats will be
defending 25 --- 10 of which are in states that Trump won. Those 10
Democratic senators will be very careful about thwarting Trump, which
makes his leverage in the Senate considerably larger than the 52
Republicans. [Trump may be a political novice, but if he's half as
skillful at negotiation as he claims to be, he will quickly grasp how to
play the legislature like a fiddle.]{.underline}

### I/L -- Trump PC AT Losing Base

#### Trump's blue-collar standing is strong

https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/20/trump-2020-rust-belt-joe-biden-1332973//RS

[The [Trump]{.mark} team]{.underline} deliberately [[chose
Pennsylvania's Lycoming County for Monday's rally]{.underline}]{.mark},
where the president will campaign with a Republican heavily favored to
win a special House election this week. [[Trump won nearly 70 percent of
the vote there]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2016, and his advisers hope to
mobilize his hardcore supporters well ahead of the general election
season. [[Pence has embarked on his own foray into the Rust

multistop tour in Wisconsin last week. [He's slated to headline a
fundraiser for the Pennsylvania GOP]{.underline} in Hershey next month.
Pence, the former Indiana governor, is focusing on trade during his
travels, visiting manufacturing plants and farms. He has reported back
to the president on concerns he's heard from workers about tariffs.
[Despite the concern about [Trump's]{.mark} Rust Belt standing, his
[supporters insist the president's appeal to blue-collar workers remains
strong]{.mark}]{.underline}. Lou Barletta, a former Pennsylvania
congressman who's expected to attend the Monday rally, argued [that
polling understates the president's popularity]{.underline} --- just as
it did in 2016. "If people haven't learned anything from the last
election," said Barletta, "they're going to get burned again."

### I/L -- Dem/Labor Support Key

#### Dems are successfully securing labor support for the bill -- faith in enforcement mechanisms are necessary to secure passage

**SALAMA 6/11** (Vivian; Wall Street Journal, "Mulvaney Sees Approval of
USMCA Trade Deal Likely,"
https://www.wsj.com/articles/mulvaney-sees-approval-of-usmca-trade-deal-likely-11560292213)ww

[The U.S.-M]{.underline}exico-[C]{.underline}anada trade
[a]{.underline}greement [has "a better than two-thirds chance" of
passing]{.underline} through Congress this year, President Trump's
acting chief of staff said Tuesday, adding [its approval depends
on]{.underline} support among House
[Dem]{.underline}ocrat[s]{.underline}. Acting White House Chief of Staff
Mick Mulvaney says he has found a happy medium between the management
styles of John Kelly and Reince Priebus that suits President Trump\'s
unconventional style. Speaking at The Wall Street Journal CFO Network
meeting, Mick Mulvaney said [the successor deal]{.underline} to the
North American Free Trade Agreement [has many supporters in the
House]{.underline}, and a likely majority in the full chamber,
[but]{.underline} Speaker Nancy [Pelosi]{.underline} (D., Calif.) [is
unlikely to bring it to the floor without a clear majority of
Dem]{.underline}ocrat[s]{.underline}. "I don't think Nancy can bring it
to the floor until she has something approaching the majority" in her
own party, he said. "We know there are champions of this bill in the
House. We know that [labor supports it;]{.underline} we know that
agriculture supports it; we know that [manufacturing supports it,
although the typical Rust Belt Democrats---that's their
base]{.underline}, they support this deal and they know that it's better
than Nafta." Mrs. Pelosi has signaled they [won't allow a
vote]{.underline} on USMCA [without certain changes, including easier
enforcement of new rules designed to strengthen labor]{.underline}
rights in Mexico. The deal must still be ratified by the U.S., Canada
and Mexico to go into effect. In her own comments Monday, Mrs. Pelosi
said enforcing the new provisions was key. **[Labor rights are central
to her base]{.underline}**, which wants to raise wages in Mexico to
reduce the incentive to ship jobs outside the U.S. "I thought that would
be the easiest trade bill we've ever had the opportunity to pass because
those who are unhappy with Nafta really want to have a new Nafta," Mrs.
Pelosi said at an event at the Peterson Foundation. "If you don't have
enforcement, you're just having Nafta again with sprinkles on top." Mr.
Mulvaney said that frustration is building at the White House over the
opposition to the trade deal, which was designed to garner support from
both political parties.

In short, Trump is making himself [look like a
fool](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trumps-defense-his-wiretap-conspiracy-theory-goes-horribly-awry).
More importantly, he is doing this when it is absolutely unnecessary to
do so. [[Trump might believe]{.mark} that [he has unlimited
p]{.mark}olitical [c]{.mark}apital]{.underline}---and with most of his
supporters, [he might well be
right](http://www.dorfonlaw.org/2017/03/trump-will-hang-on-because-press-will.html)---**[[but
he does not]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and it makes no sense for him to
make this unforced political error. It makes no sense, that is, unless
he has drawn one of two conclusions: (1) Going through with building the
wall will actually become popular with people who currently do not
support it, or (2) He is willing to lose political popularity over this
issue, because the substantive advantages of building a wall are worth
it. If he believes explanation No. 1, he is fooling himself. If it is
No. 2, he simply does not understand how border protection works. (See
also his travel bans.) It could be both, and I am betting that it is.
The reason that this is all so odd is that [[Trump seemed to have
figured out a way to glide through]{.mark} his presidency
[without]{.mark} actually [doing anything]{.mark}
important.]{.underline} He has created such a distorted political
atmosphere that he can, for example, [both confirm and
deny](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/us/politics/trump-calls-2005-tax-return-release-fake-news.html)
that a 2005 tax form was accurate, leaving everyone to wonder whether
the \"leak\" of that shred of information was planted by the White
House. Watching the press chase every crazy thing coming from his
Administration was turning out to be a seriously plausible survival
strategy. All Trump had to do was say something bizarre every time
anything serious came up, and he could skate along to the next news
cycle. Would it matter that nothing ever happened under Trump\'s
presidency? Not really. Trump could blame the Democrats, the Republicans
(especially his chew toy, Paul Ryan), and pretty much anyone else for
not getting it right. More importantly, he would not have to put his
name on anything that would be open to attack. [[This is]{.mark}
especially [important because]{.mark}]{.underline} a White House does
have to do some things that are going to be politically contentious. The
federal budget is a minefield, for example, and [[any president is going
to be **take heat for the choices of winners and
losers**]{.mark}]{.underline} that his budget implies. Trump\'s first
budget proposal makes it obvious that he is not going to do anything to
help his non-rich supporters, and he is actually proposing to [make
their lives
worse](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/us/politics/trump-budget-military-analysis.html).
(This is also true of the new health care bill.) All of which means that
[[a president who came into office with]{.mark} historically
[low]{.mark} approval [ratings]{.mark}]{.underline}, and who still
cannot accept his drubbing in the popular vote, **[[needs to do
everything he can to avoid self-inflicted wounds.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[[Under]{.mark}]{.underline} President Barack
[[Obama]{.underline}]{.mark}'s administration [[and]{.mark},
now]{.underline}, President Donald [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}'s, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has put its military might
behind the Saudi-led coalition,]{.underline} waging a war without
congressional authorization. That war has devastated Yemen's
infrastructure, destroyed or damaged more than half of Yemen's health
facilities, killed more than 8,350 civilians, injured another 9,500
civilians, displaced 3.3 million people, and created a humanitarian
disaster that threatens the lives of millions as cholera and famine
spread through the country. **[[U.S. arms]{.mark}
[merchants]{.mark}]{.underline}**, however, **[[have grown
rich]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Fragments of the bombs were documented by
journalists and HRW with help from Mastaba villagers. An HRW munitions
expert determined the bombs were 2,000-pound MK-84s, manufactured by
General Dynamics. Based in Falls Church, Va., General Dynamics is the
world's sixth most profitable arms manufacturer. One of the bombs used a
satellite guidance kit from Chicago-based Boeing, the world's
second-most profitable weapons company. The other bomb had a Paveway
guidance system, made by either Raytheon of Waltham, Mass., the
third-largest arms company in the world, or Lockheed Martin of Bethesda,
Md., the world's top weapons contractor. An In These Times analysis
found that in the past decade, the State Department has approved at
least \$30.1 billion in Saudi military contracts for these four
companies. The war in Yemen has been particularly lucrative for [General
Dynamics, Boeing and Raytheon]{.underline}, which [have received
hundreds of millions of dollars in Saudi weapons deals]{.underline}. All
three corporations have highlighted business with Saudi Arabia in their
reports to shareholders. Since the war began in March 2015, General
Dynamics' stock price has risen from about \$135 to \$169 per share,
Raytheon's from about \$108 to more than \$180, and Boeing's from about
\$150 to \$360. Lockheed Martin declined to comment for this story. A
spokesman for Boeing said the company follows "guidance from the United
States government," while Raytheon replied, "You will need to contact
the U.S. government." General Dynamics did not respond to inquiries. The
State Department declined to comment on the record. The **[weapons
contractors are]{.underline}** correct on one point: They're **[[working
hand-in-glove with the State Department]{.underline}]{.mark}**. By law,
the department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs must approve any
arms sales by U.S. companies to foreign governments. U.S. law also
prohibits sales to countries that indiscriminately kill civilians, as
the Saudi-led military coalition bombing Yemen did in the Mastaba strike
and many other documented cases. But **[[ending sales]{.mark} to Saudi
Arabia would [cost the]{.mark} U.S. arms [industry]{.mark} its biggest
global customer, and [to do so, Congress must cross an industry that
pours millions into the campaigns of lawmakers of both
parties]{.mark}]{.underline}**. THE CIVILIAN DEATH TOLL Saudi coalition
spokesperson Gen. Ahmed al-Assiri told the press that the Mastaba market
bombing targeted a gathering of Houthi fighters. But because the attack
was indiscriminate, in that it hit both civilians and a military target,
and disproportionate, in that the 97 civilian deaths would outweigh any
expected military advantage, HRW charged that the missile strikes
violated international law. According to an In These Times analysis of
reports by HRW and the Yemeni group Mwatana for Human Rights, the
Saudi-led coalition (including the United Arab Emirates \[UAE\], a Saudi
ally that is also bombing Yemen) has used U.S. weapons to kill at least
434 people and injure at least 1,004 in attacks that overwhelmingly
include civilians and civilian targets. "Most of the weapons that we
have found and been able to identify in strikes that appear unlawful
have been U.S. weapons," Motaparthy says. "Factories have been hit.
Farmlands have been hit with cluster bombs. Not only have they killed
civilians, but they have also destroyed livelihoods and contributed to a
dire humanitarian situation." "The \[U.S. government is\] now on notice
that there's a high likelihood these weapons could be used in strikes
that violate the laws of war," Motaparthy says. "They can no longer say
the Saudis are targeting accurately, that they have done their utmost to
avoid civilian casualties." According to the Foreign Assistance Act of
1961, the United States may not authorize arms exports to governments
that consistently engage in "gross violations of internationally
recognized human rights." The Arms Export Control Act of 1976 stipulates
that exported weapons may only be used for a country's defense. "When a
country uses U.S.-origin weapons for other than legitimate self-defense
purposes, the administration must suspend further sales, unless it
issues a certification to Congress that there's an overwhelming national
security need," says Brittany Benowitz, a former defense adviser for
former Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.). "The Trump administration has not
done that." A HUNDRED-BILLION-DOLLAR CLIENT Over the past decade, Saudi
Arabia has ordered U.S.-made offensive weapons, surveillance equipment,
transportation, parts and training valued at \$109.3 billion, according
to an In These Times analysis of Pentagon announcements, contracts
announced on defense industry websites and arms transfers documented by
the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. That arsenal is
now being deployed against Yemen. Saudi Arabia's precision-guided
munitions are responsible for the vast majority of deaths documented by
human rights groups. In These Times found that, since 2009, Saudi Arabia
has ordered more than 27,000 missiles worth at least \$1.8 billion from
Raytheon alone, plus 6,000 guided bombs from Boeing (worth about \$332
million) and 1,300 cluster munitions from Rhode Island-based Textron
(worth about \$641 million). About \$650 million of those Raytheon
orders and an estimated \$103 million of the Boeing orders came after
the Saudi war in Yemen began. Without these ongoing American-origin
weapons transfers, the Saudi coalition's ability to prosecute its war
would wither. "We can stop providing munitions, and they could run out
of munitions, and then it would be impossible to keep the war going,"
says Jonathan Caverley, associate professor at the U.S. Naval War
College and a research scientist at M.I.T. The warplanes the United
States delivers also need steady upkeep. [Since the war began, the
Saudis have struck deals worth \$5.5 billion with war contractors for
weapons maintenance, support and training]{.underline}. "The Saudi
military has a very sophisticated, high-tech, capital-intensive military
that requires almost constant customer service," Caverley says. "And so
most of the planes would be grounded if Lockheed Martin or Boeing turn
off the help line." "JUST A PILIING UP OF STUFF" The U.S.-Saudi
relationship has its roots in the 1938 discovery of oil in Saudi Arabia,
and President Franklin Roosevelt's energy-for-security deal with the
Saudi monarchy. Today, in addition to oil, U.S.-Saudi relations are
cemented by a geopolitical alliance against Iran---and by weapons deals.
Arms exports accelerated under Obama. By 2016, his administration had
offered to sell \$115 billion in weapons and defensive equipment to
Saudi Arabia---the most of any administration in history. Those arms
exports "used to be more of a symbolic thing, just piling up the stuff,"
says William Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the
Center for International Policy. But experts also say selling the Saudis
so many arms incentivized the Arab monarchy to use them in devastating
fashion. "If a country, like Saudi Arabia or the UAE, has no commitment
to human rights---whether stated or in practice---it's no wonder that
those countries would eventually misuse U.S.-sold weapons by committing
war crimes," says Kate Kizer, the policy director of Win Without War.
"The U.S. government should be assuming these weapons of warfare will
eventually be used in a conflict, even if one isn't going on at the
moment." With the Saudi invasion of Yemen in 2015, the U.S.-Saudi arms
pipeline became deadly. [Despite reports that U.S. bombs were killing
civilians, the Obama administration's support for the Saudi war drew
only muted criticism in Washington]{.underline}. "It was Obama's war,
and there was a lot of reluctance in Congress to take this on,
particularly among Democrats," says Shireen Al-Adeimi, a Yemeni American
activist and professor at Michigan State University. Still, advocates
with groups like Win Without War, Just Foreign Policy and the Yemen
Peace Project worked to raise public awareness of the war's horrors,
lobbying Congress and the White House. In May 2016, Obama canceled the
delivery of 400 Textron cluster bombs to Saudi Arabia. In December 2016,
two months after a Saudi airstrike hit a funeral hall and killed more
than 100 people in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, he halted the sale of
16,000 precision guided bombs from Raytheon, a deal worth \$350 million.
Those two decisions accounted for only a fraction of overall arms sales
to the Saudis, and the flow of most weapons continued unchecked. TRUMP'S
BIG PHOTO OPP When Trump took office in January 2017, he made it a
priority to strengthen the U.S.-Saudi relationship, which had taken a
hit after Obama's nuclear deal with Iran. As part of that bid, Trump
reversed Obama's decision to halt the \$350 million Raytheon order.
Trump's first overseas visit, in May 2017, was to Saudi Arabia, a jaunt
to strengthen the alliance against Iran and get Saudi Arabia to sign on
to Trump's plans for an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. During that
visit, the United States agreed to sell Saudi Arabia \$110 billion
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} American weapons, with an option for a total
of \$350 billion over the next decade. Trump boasted his deals would
bring 500,000 jobs to the United States, but his own State Department
put the figure at tens of thousands. On May 20, [[2017,]{.mark}
Trump]{.underline} and King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud [presided over
Boeing's and Raytheon's signings of M]{.underline}emorandums
[o]{.underline}f [A]{.underline}greement [with Saudi Arabia for future
business]{.underline}. Raytheon used the opportunity to open a new
division, Raytheon Saudi Arabia. "This strategic partnership is the next
step in our over 50-year relationship in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"
Raytheon CEO Thomas A. Kennedy told shareholders. "Together, we can help
build world-class defense and cyber capabilities." [The ink was barely
dry before \$500 million of the deal was threatened by [a bill]{.mark},
introduced by]{.underline} Sen. Rand [Paul]{.underline} (R-Ky.) in May
2017, [[to block the sale of bombs to Saudi Arabia. In response, Boeing
and Raytheon hired lobbying firms to make their case]{.underline}. [In
the end, five Democrats]{.underline}]{.mark}---Joe
[Donnelly]{.underline} (Ind.), Claire [McCaskill]{.underline} (Mo.), Joe
[Manchin]{.underline} (W.Va.), Bill [Nelson]{.underline} (Fla.)
[and]{.underline} Mark [Warner]{.underline} (Va.)---[[broke with their
party to ensure arms sales continued]{.underline}]{.mark}, in a 53-47
vote. [[The five had collectively received tens of thousands in arms
industry donations]{.underline},]{.mark} and would receive another
\$148,032 in the next election cycle from the PACs and employees of
Boeing and Raytheon. Nelson and McCaskill pulled in \$44,308 and
\$57,230, respectively[. Weapons firms are aided by a revolving door
with the Trump administration]{.underline}. Then-Defense Secretary Jim
Mattis, a former General Dynamics board member, warned Sen. Lindsey
Graham (R-S.C.) that the Rand Paul bill would be a boon for Iran. Acting
Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan served as a senior vice president of
Boeing prior to coming to the Defense Department, though it's unclear
whether he's championed U.S.-Saudi arms deals. The Wall Street Journal
reports that, in 2018, State Department staff, voicing concerns about
the war on Yemen, asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo not to certify
that civilian deaths were being reduced. Their concerns were overridden
by the department's Bureau of Legislative Affairs, which argued such a
move could put billions of dollars in future arms sales in jeopardy. The
bureau is led by Charles Faulkner, a former Raytheon lobbyist. CONGRESS
WAKES UP In October 2018, the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia took
center stage in Washington, when Saudi agents murdered and dismembered
journalist Jamal Khashoggi in their country's consulate in Istanbul.
Khashoggi, a Saudi Washington Post columnist, had been critical of Saudi
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The murder forced Congress to reckon
with Salman, who, as defense minister, had launched the Saudi war on
Yemen alongside a vicious crackdown on human rights activists. Suddenly,
leading members of Congress, including Graham and other defenders of the
U.S.-Saudi relationship, were alarmed at the prospect of selling more
arms to Salman. "The Khashoggi murder really broke the dam on
congressional outrage about what the administration's conduct has been
\[toward Saudi Arabia\]," says Kate Gould, former legislative director
for Middle East policy at the Friends Committee on National Legislation.
This spring, the Senate and House passed a bill championed by Sen.
Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) requiring the
United States to stop giving the Saudi coalition intelligence and to
prohibit the in-air refueling of Saudi warplanes. It was the first time
in U.S. history that both chambers of Congress invoked the War Powers
Act, designed to check the president's war-making powers by requiring
congressional authorization to deploy troops overseas. Trump vetoed the
bill on April 16. Arms expert William Hartung says the current political
climate makes new deals unlikely: "It'd be very difficult \[right now\]
to push a substantial sale of offensive weapons like bombs. Anything
that can be used in the war is probably a non-starter." Still, billions
of dollars of approved weapons are already in the pipeline. If
congressional anger at the Saudis wanes, the arms spigot could reopen.
[In February, a bipartisan group of senators]{.underline}---including
Graham and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.)---[introduced]{.underline} the Saudi
Arabia Accountability [an]{.underline}d Yemen [Act]{.underline} of 2019,
[which would halt future sales]{.underline} of ammunition, tanks,
warplanes and bombs, and suspend exports of bombs that had been given a
prior green light. Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) wants to go even further.
In January, he introduced legislation that would ban all weapons exports
to Saudi Arabia, as well as maintenance and logistical support. The bill
has 29 cosponsors (most of them Democrats). "The bottom line is: We know
for a fact that they're bombing school buses, bombing weddings, bombing
funerals, and innocent people are being murdered," McGovern told In
These Times. "The question now is: Are we going to just issue a press
release and say, 'We're horrified,' or is there going to be a
consequence?" McGovern says that if a measure like his is not passed,
"other authoritarian regimes around the world will say, 'Hey, we can do
whatever the hell we want.'" **[[To pass such bills, Congress members
will have to muscle past the arms industry.]{.underline}]{.mark}** In
Lockheed Martin's 2018 annual report, the company warned, "Discussions
in Congress may result in sanctions on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia." For
Jehan Hakim of the Yemeni Alliance Committee, [[the ongoing war comes
down to the influence of money in Washington]{.underline}]{.mark}. "We
talk to family back home \[in Yemen\] and the question they ask is,
'Why? Why is the U.S. supporting the Saudi coalition?'" Hakim says.
"Profiteering is put before the lives of humans."

#### "Buy American" plan proves the vast influence of the defense lobby -- broad bipartisan opposition to the plan

**Pendersen and Evans 2018**

Haley and Jodie, AlterNet, "Trump Is Turning the State Department into a
Global Weapons Dealer" January 11, 2018
<https://www.alternet.org/2018/01/state-department-weapons-dealer/>//dmr

The Trump administration will soon announce its next move in the ongoing
assault on diplomacy and human rights currently taking place in the
United States. [Through a plan dubbed "Buy American," the administration
is calling for U.S. attachés and diplomats to play a larger role in the
sale of U.S. weapons, effectively solidifying their role as lobbyists
for the arms industry rather than agents of diplomacy]{.underline}. This
means the State Department, the agency that is meant to foster
diplomatic relations and maintain peaceful engagement with other
countries, will now openly operate as a weapons dealer. [The
administration is essentially forcing the State Department to undermine
itself, as seeking out and expanding opportunities for increased weapons
sales are certainly not conducive to fostering peaceful global
relations]{.underline}. The "Buy American" plan will increase U.S.
officials' involvement in facilitating weapons sales, while
simultaneously easing rules that limit U.S. weapons sales to governments
with poor human rights records. The move displays an increasingly
undeniable truth---that the United States government views human rights
not as the foundation of human dignity but as an impediment to corporate
profits. More Riches for the Merchants of Death Though it has long been
the case, U.S. officials around the world will now officially serve as
salespeople for U.S. military corporations. Embassy staffers will now be
charged with promoting weapons sales and briefing visiting senior U.S.
officials so they can help finalize pending arms deals. This move by the
Pentagon and the U.S. State Department to advance the interests of the
arms industry will increase profits for the merchants of death that are
already thriving thanks to U.S. involvement in perpetual warfare around
the globe. Shares of the five biggest military corporations---Lockheed
Martin, Raytheon, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, and General Dynamics---have
more than tripled over the last five years and currently trade at or
near all-time highs, so they are literally making a killing on killing.
Additionally, foreign military sales in fiscal year 2017, under the
purview of both Obama and Trump, climbed to \$42 billion, compared to
\$31 billion in the prior year, according to the U.S. Defense Security
Cooperation Agency. And global arms sales in 2016 rose for the first
time since 2010, with 57.9 percent of global arms sales coming from U.S.
companies. Existing arms sales restrictions have not prevented U.S.
weapons from being used to aid repressive military interventions. U.S.
weapons companies that stand to profit from the administration's new
plan have long made billions from the sale of bombs, missiles and
aircraft that have been vital to the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen, a
campaign that has decimated the country's sewage and health
infrastructure, killed thousands, and caused a humanitarian crisis. In
addition, U.S. military corporations enjoy deep business connections
with Israel, and profit from supplying the military tools used to uphold
Israel's occupation of Palestine. U.S. fighter jets, tanks, attack
helicopters, bombs, and missiles have been integral to Israel's brutal
attacks on the Palestinian people in recent decades. If present arms
sales "restrictions" have enabled U.S. weaponry to play a major role in
such atrocities, what tragedies will U.S. weapons contribute to under
human rights standards weakened or revoked with this new plan? **[\'Buy
American\' Is the Culmination of Arms Industry Influence The
move]{.underline}** to turn the U.S. State Department into an outright
arms brokerage platform **[is a reflection of the immense power and
influence of the]{.underline}** arms **[industry]{.underline}**.
[Military corporations have engaged in extremely aggressive lobbying
over the past several years, spending a total of more than \$1 billion
on lobbying since 2009 and employing anywhere from 700 to 1,000
lobbyists in any given year.]{.underline} To put that in perspective,
the arms industry has employed significantly more than one lobbyist per
member of Congress each year. Consider also that Trump has made common
practice of populating his administration with former weapons industry
executives. The practice is so rampant that in November 2017, Senate
Armed Services Committee Chair John McCain, warned Trump he shouldn't
nominate any more candidates from military corporations. Examples of
Trump's industry-heavy administration include Secretary of Defense James
Mattis, a former board member at General Dynamics; White House Chief of
Staff John Kelly, who worked for a number of military firms and was an
adviser to Pentagon contractor DynCorp; former Boeing executive and now
Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan; former Lockheed Martin
executive John Rood, nominated as undersecretary of defense for policy;
former Raytheon Vice President Mark Esper, newly confirmed as Secretary
of the Army; Heather Wilson, a former consultant to Lockheed Martin, who
is Secretary of the Air Force; Ellen Lord, a former CEO for the
aerospace company Textron, who is Undersecretary of Defense for
Acquisition; and National Security Council Chief of Staff Keith Kellogg,
a former employee of the major military and intelligence contractor
CACI. The "Buy American" policy is being coordinated by Trump's National
Security Council and drafted by State, Defense and Commerce Department
officials, meaning the plan is largely being crafted through a
commercial lens by individuals trained in increasing shareholder
profits, not upholding or protecting human rights. Those writing the
policy have deep connections to the corporations that stand to benefit
from the change, and they may very well return to positions with those
companies after their stint as government officials, thanks to the
revolving door between military corporations and the government. **[A
federal government that unabashedly caters to the interests of weapons
manufacturers is a bipartisan creation]{.underline}**, and the Trump
administration is simply building on the war-friendly foundation built
for it by previous administrations. But this move to officially turn
U.S. diplomats into arms brokers is an appalling statement by this
Administration that it views diplomacy and human rights as disposable,
especially if they interfere with commercial interests and shareholder
profits. "Buy American" and other moves enabling the wholesale takeover
of the U.S. government by arms industry influence have more to do with
the power and profits of this country's majors weapons makers than they
do with any imaginable benefit for the average citizen. The
administration is embarking on this new scheme supposedly all in the
name of creating great American jobs, though research shows that dollar
for dollar, investment in civilian industries like infrastructure,
healthcare, and education creates more jobs than investment in the
military sector. As 46 million people in the U.S. live in poverty, as
funding is stripped from vital life-affirming sectors and services, and
as the country falls deeper into despair, the American public would do
well to wake up to the fact that their tax dollars are funding the
official, blatant transformation of the U.S. government into the largest
arms dealer in the world.

Even Talking About It
https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/07/tomdispatch-dc-congress-defense-international-arms-business/

[When American firms dominate a global market]{.underline} worth more
than \$70 billion a year, [you'd expect to hear about it. Not so with
the global arms trade]{.underline}. It's good for one or two stories a
year in the mainstream media, usually when the annual statistics on the
state of the business come out. It's not that no one writes about
aspects of the arms trade. There are occasional pieces that, for
example, take note of the impact of US weapons transfers, including
cluster bombs, to Saudi Arabia, or of the disastrous dispensation of
weaponry to US allies in Syria, or of foreign sales of the costly,
controversial F-35 combat aircraft. And once in a while, [if a foreign
leader meets with the president, US arms sales to his or her country
might generate an article or two]{.underline}. But the sheer size of the
American arms trade, the politics that drive it, the companies that
profit from it, and its devastating global impacts are rarely discussed,
much less analyzed in any depth. So here's a question that's puzzled me
for years (and I'm something of an arms wonk): [Why do other major US
exports]{.underline}---from Hollywood movies to Midwestern grain
shipments to Boeing airliners---[garner regular coverage while trends in
weapons exports remain in relative obscurity]{.underline}? Are we
ashamed of standing essentially alone as the world's No. 1 arms dealer,
or is our Weapons "R" Us role so commonplace that we take it for
granted, like death or taxes? [The numbers should stagger
anyone]{.underline}. According to the latest figures available from the
Congressional Research Service, [the United States was credited with
more than half the value of all global arms transfer agreements in
2014]{.underline}, the most recent year for which full statistics are
available. At 14 percent, the world's second largest supplier, Russia,
lagged far behind. Washington's leadership in this field has never truly
been challenged. The US share has fluctuated between one-third and
one-half of the global market for the past two decades, peaking at an
almost monopolistic 70 percent of all weapons sold in 2011. And the gold
rush continues. Vice Admiral Joe Rixey, who heads the Pentagon's arms
sales agency, euphemistically known as the Defense Security Cooperation
Agency, estimates that arms deals facilitated by the Pentagon topped
\$46 billion in 2015, and are on track to hit \$40 billion in 2016.
Under Hewson, Lockheed has set a goal of getting at least 25 percent of
its revenues from weapons exports, and Boeing has done that company one
better. It's seeking to make overseas arms sales 30 percent of its
business. [[Arms deals are a way of life in Washington. From the
president on down, significant parts of the government are intent on
ensuring that American arms will flood the global
market]{.underline}]{.mark} and companies like Lockheed and Boeing will
live the good life. From the president on his trips abroad to visit
allied world leaders to the secretaries of state and defense to the
staffs of US embassies, [American [officials regularly act as
salespeople for]{.mark} the arms [firms.]{.mark}]{.underline} And [the
Pentagon is their enabler]{.underline}. [From brokering, facilitating,
and literally banking the money from arms deals to transferring weapons
to favored allies]{.underline} on the taxpayers' dime, [it is in essence
the world's largest arms dealer]{.underline}. In a typical sale, [the US
government is involved every step of the way.]{.underline} The Pentagon
often does assessments of an allied nation's armed forces in order to
tell them what they "need"---and of course what they always need is
billions of dollars in new US-supplied equipment. Then [the Pentagon
helps negotiate the terms of the deal, notifies Congress of its details,
and collects the funds from the foreign buyer]{.underline}, which it
then gives to the US supplier in the form of a defense contract. In most
deals, the Pentagon is also the point of contact for maintenance and
spare parts for any US-supplied system. The bureaucracy that helps make
all of this happen, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, is funded
from a 3.5 percent surcharge on the deals it negotiates. This gives it
all the more incentive to sell, sell, sell. **[And [the pressure]{.mark}
for yet more of the same [is always intense]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in
part [[because]{.mark} the [weapons makers are careful to spread their
production facilities to as many states and localities as
possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this way, [they ensure that endless
support for government promotion of major arms sales]{.underline}
becomes part and parcel of domestic politics. General Dynamics, for
instance, has managed to keep its tank plants in Ohio and Michigan
running through a combination of add-ons to the Army budget---funds
inserted into that budget by Congress even though the Pentagon didn't
request them---and exports to Saudi Arabia. [Boeing is banking on a
proposed deal]{.underline} to sell 40 F-18s to Kuwait [to keep its St.
Louis production line open]{.underline}, and is currently jousting with
the Obama administration to get it to move more quickly on the deal.
[**[Not surprisingly, members of Congress]{.underline}** [and local
business leaders in such states **become strong supporters of weapons
exports**]{.underline}]{.mark}[**.** Though seldom thought of this way,
the US political system is also a global arms distribution system of the
first order]{.underline}. In this context, the Obama administration has
proven itself a good friend to arms exporting firms. During President
Obama's first six years in office, Washington entered into agreements to
sell more than \$190 billion in weaponry worldwide---more, that is, than
any US administration since World War II. In addition, Team Obama has
loosened restrictions on arms exports, making it possible to send abroad
a whole new range of weapons and weapons components---including Black
Hawk and Huey helicopters and engines for C-17 transport planes---with
far less scrutiny than was previously required. This has been good news
for the industry, which had been pressing for such changes for decades
with little success. But the weaker regulations also make it potentially
easier for arms smugglers and human rights abusers to get their hands on
US arms. For example, 36 US allies---from Argentina and Bulgaria to
Romania and Turkey---will no longer need licenses from the State
Department to import weapons and weapons parts from the United States.
This will make it far easier for smuggling networks to set up front
companies in such countries and get US arms and arms components that
they can then pass on to third parties like Iran or China. Already a
common practice, it will only increase under the new regulations. The
degree to which the Obama administration has been willing to bend over
backward to help weapons exporters was underscored at a 2013 hearing on
those administration export "reforms." Tom Kelly, then the deputy
assistant secretary of the State Department's Bureau of
Political-Military Affairs, caught the spirit of the era when asked
whether the administration was doing enough to promote American arms
exports. He responded: \[We are\] advocating on behalf of our companies
and doing everything we can to make sure that these sales go
through...and that is something we are doing every day, basically \[on\]
every continent in the world...and we're constantly thinking of how we
can do better." One place where, with a helping hand from the Obama
administration and the Pentagon, the arms industry has been doing a lot
better of late is the Middle East. Washington has brokered deals for
more than \$50 billion in weapons sales to Saudi Arabia alone for
everything from F-15 fighter aircraft and Apache attack helicopters to
combat ships and missile defense systems. The most damaging deals, if
not the most lucrative, have been the sales of bombs and missiles to the
Saudis for their brutal war in Yemen, where thousands of civilians have
been killed and millions of people are going hungry. [[Members of
Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} like Michigan Representative John Conyers
and Connecticut Senator Chris [Murphy [have pressed for legislation that
would at least stem the flow of]{.mark} the most deadly of the
[weaponry]{.mark}]{.underline} being sent for use there[, [but **they
have yet to overcome** the considerable clout of]{.mark}]{.underline}
the Saudis in Washington (and, of course, that of **[[the arms
industry]{.mark}]{.underline}** as well).

Chronic human rights violator Saudi Arabia is using American-made
weapons against civilians in the fifth-poorest nation in the world,
Yemen. And make no mistake: [U.S. [defense contractors and their
lobbyists and supporters in government are getting rich]{.mark} in the
process.]{.underline} "Our role is not to make policy, our role is to
comply with it," [John Harris, CEO of defense contractor Raytheon
International]{.underline}, said to CNBC in February. But his statement
vastly [understates the role that **[defense contractors and
lobbyists]{.mark}** play in Washington's halls of power, where their
**[influence on policy directly impacts their bottom
lines]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Since 2015, Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates have waged war against Yemen, killing and injuring
thousands of Yemeni civilians. An estimated 90,000 people have been
killed, according to one international tracker. By December 2017, the
number of cholera cases in Yemen had surged past one million, the
largest such outbreak in modern history. An estimated 113,000 children
have died since April 2018 from war-related starvation and disease. The
United Nations calls the situation in Yemen the largest humanitarian
crisis on earth, as over 14 million face starvation. The majority of the
6,872 Yemeni civilians killed and 10,768 wounded have been victims of
Saudi-led coalition airstrikes, according to the Office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). Nearly 90 coalition
airstrikes have hit homes, schools, markets, hospitals, and mosques
since 2015, according to Human Rights Watch. In 2018, the coalition
bombed a wedding, killing 22 people, including eight children. Another
strike hit a bus, killing at least 26 children. [American-origin
munitions produced by companies like Lockheed Martin, Boeing, General
Dynamics, and Raytheon were identified at the site of over two dozen
attacks throughout Yemen]{.underline}. Indeed, the United States is the
single largest arms supplier to the Middle East and has been for
decades, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service.
From 2014 to 2018, the United States supplied 68 percent of Saudi
Arabia's arms imports, 64 percent of the UAE's imports, and 65 percent
of Qatar's imports. Some of this weaponry was subsequently stolen or
sold to al-Qaeda linked groups in the Arabian Peninsula, where they
could be used against the U.S. military, according to reports. The
[Saudi use of U.S.-made jets, bombs, and missiles against Yemeni
civilian centers constitutes a war crime]{.underline}. It was an
American laser-guided MK-82 bomb that killed the children on the bus;
Raytheon's technology killed the 22 people attending the wedding in 2018
as well as a family traveling in their car; and another American-made
MK-82 bomb ended the lives of at least 80 men, women, and children in a
Yemeni marketplace in March 2016. Yet **[American [defense
contractors]{.mark} continue to [spend millions of dollars to lobby
Washington]{.mark} to maintain the flow of arms to these
countries]{.underline}**. "**[Companies like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon,
Boeing, and other defense contractors see countries like Saudi Arabia
and the UAE as huge potential markets]{.underline}**," Stephen Miles,
director of Win Without War, told TAC. "They see them as [**massive
opportunities to make a lot of money**; that's why they're investing
billions and billions of dollars. This is a huge revenue stream to these
companies]{.underline}." Boeing, Raytheon, and General Dynamics have all
highlighted business with Saudi Arabia in their shareholder reports.
[["Operations and maintenance have become a very profitable niche market
for U.S. corporations]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Richard Aboulafia, a
vice president at Teal Group. He added that **[[defense contractors can
make as much as 150 percent more profit off of operations and
maintenance than from the original arms sale]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
U.S. weapons supply 57 percent of the military aircraft used by the
Royal Saudi Air Force, and mechanics and technicians hired by American
companies repair and maintain their fighter jets and helicopters. In
2018 alone, the United States made \$4.5 billion worth of arms deals to
Saudi Arabia and \$1.2 billion to the United Arab Emirates, a report by
William Hartung and Christina Arabia found. From the report: ["Lockheed
Martin...was involved in deals worth \$25 billion; Boeing, \$7.1 billion
in deals; Raytheon, \$5.5 billion in deals; Northrop Grumman had one
deal worth \$2.5 billion; and BAE systems...had a \$1.3 billion
deal."]{.underline} "Because of the nature of U.S. arms control law,
most of these sales have to get government approval, and we've
absolutely seen lobbyists weighing in heavily on this," Miles said. "The
last time I saw the numbers, the [[arms industry had nearly 1,000
registered lobbyists]{.underline}]{.mark}. They're not on the Hill
lobbying Congress about how many schools we should open next year.
[They're lobbying for defense contractors]{.underline}. The past 18
years of endless wars have been incredibly lucrative for the arms
industry, and they have a vested industry in seeing these wars continue,
and not curtailing the cash cow that...has been for them." [The defense
industry spent \$125 million on lobbying in 2018. Of that, Boeing spent
\$15 million on lobbyists, Lockheed Martin spent \$13.2 million, General
Dynamics \$11.9 million, and Raytheon \$4.4 million, according to the
Lobbying Disclosure Act website]{.underline}. Writes Ben Freeman:
According to a new report...[firms registered under the Foreign Agents
Registration Act have reported receiving more than \$40 million from
Saudi Arabia in 2017 and 2018. Saudi lobbyists and public relations
professionals have contacted Congress, the executive branch, media
outlets and think tanks more than 4,000 times. Much of this work has
been focused on ensuring that sales of U.S. arms to Saudi Arabia
continue unabated and blocking congressional actions that would end U.S.
support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen]{.underline}. ...
[Lobbyists, lawyers and public relations firms working for the Saudis
have also reported doling out more than \$4.5 million in campaign
contributions in the past two years]{.underline}, including at least
\$6,000 to Trump. In many cases, these contributions have gone to
members of Congress they've contacted regarding the Yemen war. In fact,
s[ome [contributions have gone to members of Congress]{.mark} on the
exact same day they were contacted by Saudi lobbyists, and some were
made to key members [just before, and even on the day of, important
Yemen votes.]{.mark}]{.underline} Over a dozen lobbying firms employed
by defense contractors have also been working on behalf of the Saudi or
Emiratis, efficiently lobbying for both the arms buyers and sellers in
one fell swoop. One of these lobbying firms, the McKeon Group, led by
former Republican congressman and chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee Howard McKeon, represents both Saudi Arabia and the American
defense contractors Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Orbital ATK,
MBDA, and L3 Technologies. Lockheed Martin and Northrup Grumman are the
biggest suppliers of arms to Saudi Arabia. In 2018, [the McKeon Group
took \$1,697,000 from 10 defense contractors "to, among other
objectives, continue the flow of arms to Saudi Arabia,"]{.underline}
reports National Memo. Freeman details multiple examples where
[lobbyists working on behalf of the Saudis met with a senator's staff
and then made a substantial contribution to that senator's campaign
within days of a key vote to keep the United States in the Yemen
war.]{.underline} American Defense International (ADI) represents the
United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia's coalition partner in the war
against Yemen, as well as several American defense contractors,
including General Dynamics, Northrup Grumman, Raytheon, L3 Technologies,
and General Atomics. Not to be outdone by the McKeon Group, ADI's
**[[lobbyists have also aggressively pursued possible swing votes in the
U.S. Senate]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the hefty sum of \$45,000 a
month, paid for by the UAE. ADI lobbyists discussed the "situation in
Yemen" and the "Paveway sale to the UAE," the same bomb used in the
deadly wedding strike, with the office of Senator Martin Heinrich, a
member of the Armed Services Committee, according to FARA reports. ADI's
lobbyists also met with Congressman Steve Scalise's legislative director
to advise his office to vote against the congressional resolution on
Yemen. For their lobbying, Raytheon paid ADI \$120,000 in 2018. In
addition to the overt influence exercised by lobbyists for the defense
industry, many [former arms industry executives are embedded in
influential posts throughout the Trump administration]{.underline}: from
former Airbus, Huntington Ingalls, and Raytheon lobbyist Charles
Faulkner at the State Department, who pushed Mike Pompeo to support arms
sales in the Yemen war; to former Boeing executive and erstwhile head of
the Department of Defense Patrick Shanahan; to his interim replacement
Mark Esper, secretary of the Army and another former lobbyist for
Raytheon. The war in Yemen has been good for American defense
contractors' bottom lines. Since the conflict began, General Dynamics'
stock price has risen from about \$135 to \$169 per share, Raytheon's
from about \$108 to more than \$180, and Boeing's from about \$150 to
\$360, according to In These Times. Their analysis found that those four
companies have had at least \$30.1 billion in Saudi military contracts
approved by the State Department over the last 10 years. In April,
President Donald Trump vetoed a resolution that would have ended
American support for the Saudi-UAE coalition war against Yemen. Such
efforts have failed to meet the 60-vote veto-proof threshold needed in
the Senate. There are a few senators who didn't vote for the War Powers
resolution "that will probably vote for the Raytheon sales," Brittany
Benowitz, a lawyer and former adviser to a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, told TAC. "I think you'll continue to see horrific
bombings and as the famine rages on, people will start to ask, 'Why are
we a part of this war?' Unfortunately, I don't think that will start to
happen anytime soon."

#### Millions to campaigns and hundreds of lobbyists

**Cohen, 15**---staff writer for Reuters, Time Magazine, POLITICO, The
Tab, and Lake Tahoe News (Alexander, "Defense Contractors Spend Millions
to Overturn Limits on Military Spending," Time Magazine, 8/5/15,
<https://time.com/3984453/defense-contractors-lobbying/>, AS)

[The Pentagon's top contractors sent an **army of more than 400
lobbyists** to Capitol Hill this spring to press their case for
increasing the nation's spending on military hardware, in a massive
effort costing tens of millions of dollars of their own funds from April
to June alone]{.underline}, according to an analysis of public lobbying
data by the Center for Public Integrity. [The contractors are upset in
part because most]{.underline} military [spending has been capped for
the past few years under budget controls]{.underline} meant to rein in
government debt. So far, the caps have forced a decline in main defense
budgets from about \$528.2 billion in fiscal 2011 to \$496.1 billion in
fiscal 2015, instead of a previously projected increase to roughly \$598
billion. Mounting frustration with the caps was evident in the
administration's submission this year of a military budget that exceeded
the limits by about \$38 billion, followed by moves by both branches of
Congress to add even more billions. [The caps remain the law of the
land, however, and they won't go away until Congress votes to lift
them.]{.underline} The issue has so far been tangled up in a dispute
between the parties over whether to also increase spending on social
welfare programs. But [several lobbyists said in interviews that they
were optimistic that this could finally be the year that lawmakers agree
to let defense contractors return to their historic pattern of
ever-higher revenue from the federal treasury.]{.underline} This could
explain in part why total lobbying expenditures by the 53 top defense
contractors that reported paying for such work in the second quarter of
2015 were more than 25 percent higher than the amount they spent in the
same quarter of 2014 --- \$58.5 million instead of \$45.7 million. But
not all of the lobbying was related solely to military spending.
**[Boeing]{.underline}**, a \$100 billion corporation that makes
military aircraft and other lethal hardware, as well as civilian
aerospace goods, reported to the clerk of the House and the secretary of
the Senate that it [**spent almost \$13.2 million on lobbying in the
first two quarters** of this year.]{.underline} Its filing said some of
this expenditure was related to expanding its "Commercial Aircraft
Sales/Services" and supporting the Export-Import Bank, among other
issues. The aerospace contractor's commercial aircraft division receives
billions in financing from the bank, and so it has a large stake in this
year's continuing congressional skirmish over renewing the bank's
charter. Gayla Keller, a Boeing communications director, declined to
comment specifically on their lobbying activities in an emailed response
to questions. Parsing the lobbying reports to sort out just the
defense-related expenditures for these contractors is not easy, because
the lobbying reporting requirements have some ambiguity baked into them.
Lobbying expenses are only reported on an overall basis for an
organization, and aren't tied to specific issues or associated with the
agencies that lobbyists target. And for some of the top defense
contractors, the Pentagon is only one of many customers, albeit an
outsized one. Still, 40 of the [53 top contractors]{.underline} that
[lobbied during the last quarter]{.underline} reported that one target
of their efforts was the National Defense Authorization Act, the main
legislation authorizing defense spending each year. Some of these firms
--- including Boeing, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon
--- said that their efforts were aimed at budget controls.

#### Arms sales lobbyists are remarkably influential in Congress---empirics

Influence Transparency Initiative at the Center for International Policy
(Mashal and James, "The Lobbyists Who Profit From War Crimes In Yemen,"
The National Memo, 5/18/19,

AS)

A springtime wedding in Northern Yemen's Al-Raqah village took place in
April 2018, a moment of reprieve from the turmoil and devastation of
that war-torn country, a moment to celebrate life, love, and the birth
of a new family. From the tents constructed for the event, music flooded
into the village and, as at any good wedding, exuberant dancing was a
central part of the festivities. Unbeknownst to the guests, the music
masked the buzzing of a warplane overhead. Suddenly, in a horrific turn
of events, Saudi-led forces launched a deadly airstrike and 20-year-old
groom Yahya Ja'afar's wedding was transformed into a scene of carnage.
Deafened by the explosion, guests fearfully searched for loved ones in a
sea of confusion and body parts. In a telling photo, the flowery wreaths
worn by celebrants lie atop a landscape of rubble. At least 20
wedding-goers lost their lives to the Saudi-led coalition's now
four-year-old brutal campaign in that country. Shortly thereafter, media
reports identified the bomb as American-made --- a GBU-12 Paveway II
linked to Raytheon, one of the Pentagon's largest defense contractors.
Tragedies like this, however, didn't stop President Trump from
exercising his veto power on April 16th to reject a resolution passed by
Congress to end American involvement in the Yemeni conflict. Nor did
they sway most Republicans in Congress to use their override power to
kill the veto on May 2nd. After all, for many of Washington's actors,
such [tragedies, while devastating, are part of a **remarkably lucrative
business model.**]{.underline} Obviously, [this is the case for the
American defense companies that have been supplying weapons and
equipment]{.underline} of all sorts to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) [in their ongoing war. But it's no less so for the
little-**publicized lobbying groups that represent them**.]{.underline}
In 2018, [more than a dozen such firms were working on behalf of the
Saudis or the Emiratis, while also providing their services to defense
contractors whose weapons are being used in the conflict. Two prominent
examples]{.underline} of lobbying firms with significant stakes [in the
Yemen War are the McKeon Group and American Defense International (ADI).
Both firms have cleverly managed to represent both the most powerful
U.S. arms manufacturers and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
This lobbying model, which allows them to satisfy multiple clients at
the same tim]{.underline}e --- contractors eager to secure arms deals
and foreign powers that depend on American political and military
support --- [has played a significant role in keeping the United States
rooted in the Yemen conflict.]{.underline} Yahya Ja'afar's wedding
illustrates a disturbing pattern. Reports indicate that, [at the sites
of many Saudi-UAE coalition airstrikes]{.underline} in Yemen, [evidence
of munitions produced by the big four American defense
contractors]{.underline} --- [Lockheed Martin, Boeing, General Dynamics,
and Raytheon]{.underline} --- [can be found.]{.underline} These four
companies represent the largest suppliers of weapons to the Saudi and
UAE coalition and have spent millions of dollars on lobbying efforts to
retain political support in Washington. [Their arsenal of lobbyists
**works tenaciously on the Hill**, securing meetings with top officials
on key congressional committees to advocate and push for increased arms
sales. In 2018]{.underline}, according to the Lobbying Disclosure Act
website, which provides information on such firms and their domestic
clients, [Boeing spent \$15 million on lobbyists, Lockheed Martin \$13.2
million, General Dynamics \$11.9 million, and Raytheon \$4.4
million.]{.underline} While this may seem like an exorbitant amount of
money, [such expenses have yielded an **extraordinary return on
investment** via arms sales to the Saudis and Emiratis]{.underline}. A
report published by the Center for International Policy last year
documented that such companies and others like them sold \$4.5 billion
worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia and \$1.2 billion to the United Arab
Emirates in 2018 alone. And [at the heart of this web of money are firms
like ADI and the McKeon Group that make their profits off both the
weapon-makers and the war makers. Led by former Republican congressman
and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee Howard "Buck" McKeon,
the McKeon Group has double-dipped in this "forgotten war" for three
years now]{.underline}. After all, the firm represents many of the top
sellers of arms and munitions, including Lockheed Martin, Northrop
Grumman, Orbital ATK, MBDA, and L3 Technologies, as well as Saudi
Arabia. In other words, the McKeon Group lobbies Washington's political
machine for both the sellers and the buyer. From his earliest days in
the House, Buck McKeon has had ties to the U.S. defense industry. [His
trajectory into and out of Congress offers, in fact, a perfect example
of what Washington's military-industrial "**revolving door**" looks
like]{.underline}. From 1991 to 2014, years when he held California's
25th Congressional district seat, McKeon received campaign contributions
totaling \$192,900 from Lockheed Martin and \$190,200 from Northrop
Grumman. Those two companies were then his top campaign contributors and
are now his current clients. In return, he advanced their interests
inside Congress, especially as the powerful chairman of the Armed
Services Committee, and now does the same from the outside as a major
lobbyist. His firm receives an annual retainer of \$190,000from Lockheed
Martin and \$110,000 from Northrop Grumman for its efforts on the Hill.
In 2018 alone, in fact, the firm took in a whopping \$1,697,000 from 10
of the largest defense contractors to, among other objectives, continue
the flow of arms to Saudi Arabia. [At the same time, McKeon and his firm
also work directly for Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, which just happens to
be one of the biggest foreign buyers of Lockheed Martin and Northrop
Grumman weaponry. The records of the Foreign Agents Registration Act
(FARA) reveal that, last year, [the McKeon Group was paid \$920,148.21
by the Kingdom and engaged in aggressive political lobbying in Congress
against bills that would have adversely affected the U.S. arms trade
with the Saudis]{.underline}. Above all, [there was S.J.
54]{.underline}, the Yemen Resolution jointly sponsored by Senator
Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Senator Mike Lee (R-UT), meant to end American
involvement in that war. FARA filings indicate that [the firm made
numerous phone calls and sent multiple emails to members of the Senate
and House as key votes approached.]{.underline} Most notably, on
November 14, 2018, [exactly two weeks before a vote]{.underline} on the
resolution [was to take place, the McKeon Group contacted Oklahoma
Republican Senator Jim Inhofe, the current chairman of the Armed
Services Committee, on behalf of the Saudis.]{.underline} Inhofe's
congressional office was called in "regards to the KSA \[Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia\]" and again on November 29th, the day after the vote,
"regarding S.J. Res. 54." On the 14th, the [firm also gave a \$1,000
donation to the Senator. Ultimately, Inhofe **voted in favor of
continuing military support for the Saudis**]{.underline}, undeterred by
the thousands of civilian deaths the war has caused. [When the McKeon
Group succeeds]{.underline} in advancing the agenda of the Saudis and
the giant weapons makers in Washington[, it proves its value and
receives significant compensation.]{.underline} And
[nothing]{.underline}, including the murder of Washington Post columnist
Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul or continued reports
on the country's brutal war and blockade in Yemen, which has left
significant numbers of Yemenis dead of, or at the edge of, starvation,
[has stopped Buck McKeon and his firm from continuing to ramp up their
lobbying activities.]{.underline} As for [American Defense
International]{.underline}, it [has similarly double-dipped in the Yemen
war. It, too, represents an **impressive list of defense contractors**,
including Raytheon, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, L3 Technologies,
and General Atomics --- and also the United Arab Emirates,]{.underline}
the Saudi-war coalition member that often slides under the media radar.
At a moment filled with harrowing reports of death, starvation, and
devastation in Yemen, [ADI's lobbyists spent their days aggressively
advancing the interests of their Emirati and defense contractor
clients]{.underline}. For instance, FARA reports reveal that, [in
September 2018, ADI called the office of New Mexico Democratic Senator
Martin Heinrich, a member of the Armed Services Committee, on behalf of
the UAE embassy in Washington]{.underline}. The discussion, according to
FARA, focused on the "situation in Yemen" and the "Paveway sale to the
UAE" --- in other words, on the sale of the very kind of Raytheon bomb
that turned Yahya Ja'afar's wedding into the scene of a deadly
airstrike. FARA filings also indicate, for example, that [during the
same month, ADI met with the policy adviser for Louisiana Republican
Congressman Steve Scalise to lobby against the congressional resolution
on Yemen.]{.underline} For these and similar efforts, [the UAE continued
to pump \$45,000 a month into ADI]{.underline}. At the same time, such
lobbying efforts clearly benefited another client of the firm:
[Raytheon]{.underline}. The manufacturer of Paveway bombs [paid ADI
\$120,000 in 2018.]{.underline} For firms like American Defense
International and the McKeon Group, war is a matter of profits and
clients and little else. [President Trump's veto of the resolution to
end American support]{.underline} for the Saudi-UAE coalition in Yemen
[and Congress's inability to override it]{.underline} (against the
wishes of much of the American public) [have]{.underline}, for the
moment, **[left lobbying outfits]{.underline}** like the McKeon Group
and ADI [**in the driver's seat**. That veto]{.underline}, after all,
[made it clear that, for Donald Trump and many congressional
Republicans, the well-being of the Saudi royals and of defense
contractors matters]{.underline} more than a bus carrying school
children destroyed by a laser-guided MK-82 bomb made by Lockheed Martin;
that the wellbeing of Raytheon is of far greater importance than a
family traveling in their car hit by a GBU-12 laser-guided bomb made by
that very company; that the profits of such defense contractors are so
much more important than the lives of the men, women, and children who
were in a marketplace in Yemen on a quiet afternoon in March 2016, when
another MK-82 bomb took the lives of at least 80 of them. In addition to
being used repeatedly in air strikes that have killed civilians,
American munitions have also evidently made it into the hands of
terrorist organizations in Yemen. Reports indicate that the very weapons
that companies like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon are selling to the
Saudis and Emiratis have, in some instances, been stolen or even sold to
organizations linked to al-Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula, arms that could
someday even be used against U.S. military personnel. Today, with the
President's veto and Congress's failure to override it, [the Saudi-UAE
coalition, U.S. defense contractors, and their American lobbyists have,
in essence, been given a green light to proceed with a business model
that counts innocent Yemenis' deaths as the cost of doing
business.]{.underline} Still, though yet another battle has been lost in
that war at home, opposition to it may not yet be relegated to the
dustbin of history. Certain members of Congress are still looking for
new ways of tackling the issue, including the possibility of defunding
American involvement in the war and the human rights violations that go
with it. Clearly, there are still opportunities to send a message that
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates can no longer simply write
checks to lobbying firms like the McKeon Group and ADI to purchase
influence and ensure that American politicians look the other way.
Someday perhaps the United States will no longer allow itself to be
implicated in tragedies like Yahya Ja'afar's wedding that end with a
landscape of rubble and the remnants of an American bomb.

It's one of those stories of the century that somehow never gets treated
that way. For an astounding 25 of the past 26 years, the United States
has been the leading arms dealer on the planet, at some moments in near
monopolistic fashion. Its major weapons-producers, including Boeing,
Raytheon, and Lockheed Martin, regularly pour the latest in high-tech
arms and munitions into the most explosive areas of the planet with
ample assistance from the Pentagon. In recent years, the bulk of those
arms have gone to the Greater Middle East. Donald
**[[Trump]{.mark}]{.underline}** is only the latest American president
to preside over a global arms sales bonanza. With remarkable enthusiasm,
[**he['s appointed himself America's number one weapons salesman and he
couldn't be prouder of the job he's doing]{.mark}**. [Earlier this
month]{.mark}]{.underline}, for instance, on the very day Congress was
debating whether to end U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's brutal war in
Yemen, [[Trump engaged in one of his favorite presidential activities:
bragging about the economic benefits of the American arms sales he's
been promoting]{.underline}]{.mark}. He was joined in his moment of
braggadocio by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the chief
architect of that war. That grim conflict has killed thousands of
civilians through indiscriminate air strikes, while putting millions at
risk of death from famine, cholera, and other "natural" disasters caused
at least in part by a Saudi-led blockade of that country's ports. That
Washington-enabled humanitarian crisis provided the backdrop for the
Senate's consideration of a bill co-sponsored by Vermont independent
Senator Bernie Sanders, Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee, and
Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy. It was aimed at ending U.S.
mid-air refueling of Saudi war planes and Washington's additional
assistance for the Saudi war effort (at least until the war is
explicitly authorized by Congress). The bill generated a vigorous
debate. In the end, on an issue that wouldn't have even come to the
floor two years ago, an unprecedented 44 senators voted to halt this
country's support for the Saudi war effort. The bill nonetheless went
down to defeat and the suffering in Yemen continues. Debate about the
merits of that brutal war was, however, the last thing on the mind of a
president who views his bear-hug embrace of the Saudi regime as a
straightforward business proposition. **[[He's so enthusiastic about
selling arms to Riyadh]{.mark} that [he]{.mark} even [brought
his]{.mark} very [own prop]{.mark} to the White House meeting with bin
Salman: [a U.S. map highlighting which of the 50 states would benefit
most from]{.mark} pending weapons [sales]{.mark} to the prince's
country]{.underline}**. [[You]{.mark} undoubtedly [won't be surprised to
learn that Michigan, Ohio, and Florida, the three crucial swing
states]{.mark} in the 2016 presidential election, [were specially
highlighted]{.mark}]{.underline}. His latest stunt only underscored a
simple fact of his presidency: Trump's arms sales are meant to promote
pork-barrel politics, while pumping up the profits of U.S. weapons
manufacturers. As for human rights or human lives, who cares? To be
fair, Donald Trump is hardly the first American president to make it his
business to aggressively promote weapons exports. Though seldom a
highlighted part of his presidency, Barack Obama proved to be a weapons
salesman par excellence. He made more arms offers in his two terms in
office than any U.S. president since World War II, including an
astounding \$115 billion in weapons deals with Saudi Arabia. For the
tiny group of us who follow such things, that map of Trump's only
underscored a familiar reality. On it, **[[in addition to the map
linking U.S. jobs and arms transfers to the Saudis, were little boxes
that highlighted four specific weapons sales worth tens of billions of
dollars]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Three of those that included the THAAD
missile defense system, C-130 transport planes, P-8 anti-submarine
warfare planes, and Bradley armored vehicles were, in fact, completed
during the Obama years. So much for Donald Trump's claim to be a deal
maker the likes of which we've never seen before. You might, in fact,
say that the truest arms race these days is between American presidents,
not the United States and other countries. Not only has the U.S. been
the world's top arms exporting nation throughout this century, but last
year it sold one and a half times as much weaponry as its closest rival,
Russia.

William D. Hartung, a TomDispatch regular, is the director of the Arms
and Security Project at the Center for International Policy and the

Like an Arms Bonanza," January 11, 2018

Here's a cheery note for you: the last mass killing of 2017 took place
moments before midnight on New Year's Eve. A 16-year-old New Jersey boy
picked up a semi-automatic rifle, "lawfully acquired" by a member of his
family, and killed his father, mother, sister, and a family friend. In
doing so, he helped ensure that 2017 would be the deadliest year for
mass killings in our modern history. ([There is now, on average,
slightly more than one mass killing a day in this country]{.underline}.)
Nonetheless, guns of all sorts, including military-style assault rifles
and even bump stocks like the 12 Stephen Paddock evidently used to turn
his semi-automatics into functional automatics and slaughter 58 people
from a hotel window in Las Vegas, are still readily available. Nowhere
on Earth, not even in ravaged Yemen (which takes second place in gun
ownership), is more weaponry available to more types of people. As the
years go by here, such weapons are more easily and openly carried with
only the most minimal of background checks (or less than that). Think
about this: Americans, 4.4% of the people on this planet, own 42% of the
guns and commit 31% of the mass killings. Oh, and I did promise you that
there was something cheery in all this, didn't I? So here it is: the
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration, knowing a good thing when
it sees it, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} now [hard at work ensuring that
American weapons makers will make it a remarkably similar
world]{.underline}. Its officials are intent, it seems, on recreating
the planet in an American image. Keep in mind that U.S. arms makers like
Lockheed, Raytheon, and General Dynamics already monopolize the global
arms market in a way that should (but in this country regularly doesn't)
stagger the imagination. U.S. weapons sales in 2016, for instance, took
about 50% of global market share and many of those major weapons systems
went into planetary hot spots, including Yemen (thanks to the
American-backed Saudi war of annihilation there). Weaponry from other
countries, year after year in this century, came in a distant second,
third, or fourth. Between 2012 and 2016, in fact, the U.S. sold weaponry
to at least 100 countries. So Washington is already, in significant
ways, arming the world, but evidently, as far as President Trump and the
weapons makers he loves are concerned, not yet enough of it. As a
result, [his administration is reportedly [planning to open the global
spigot on the very sorts of weapons]{.mark} now regularly used in this
country for mass killings, [making it far easier for American]{.mark}
gun and ammunition [manufacturers to sell]{.mark} to anyone interested
[abroad]{.mark} and far harder for law enforcement here to track whose
hands those weapons end up in. Administration officials supposedly plan
to cut down on oversight for such sales [by making]{.mark} the
[Commerce]{.mark} Department, [not]{.mark} the [State]{.mark}
Department, [responsible for them, while streamlining small arms export
controls]{.mark}]{.underline}, a process the Obama administration began.
At news of this, the (non-bump) stocks of gun manufacturers surged.
Think of this in Trumpian terms as the global deregulation of American
firearms which could, in turn, according to critics, put such weaponry
ever more easily in the hands of both criminal gangs and extremist
groups. If this happens, we'll truly be in an open carry, NRA world, and
Donald Trump will have fulfilled a campaign promise made at that
organization\'s annual meeting last year. ("You came through for me and
I am going to come through for you.") From nuclear weapons to handguns,
"arms control" increasingly seems like a concept from another century.
There are nonetheless voices still speaking up against the wholesale
American weaponization of the planet and one of the most knowledgeable
is that of TomDispatch regular William Hartung, director of the Arms and
Security Project at the Center for International Policy. So let him fill
you in on what the coming boom years are likely to look like for the
Pentagon, the arms makers, and their weaponry. Tom [[As]{.mark} Donald
[Trump]{.mark} might [put it]{.mark}, major [weapons contractors]{.mark}
like Boeing, Raytheon, and Lockheed Martin [cashed in "bigly" in his
first year in office]{.mark}. They raked in tens of billions of dollars
in Pentagon contracts, while posting sharp stock price increases and
healthy profits driven by the continuation and expansion of Washington's
post-9/11 wars. But [last year's bonanza is likely to be no more than a
down payment on even better days to come for the military-industrial
complex]{.mark}.]{.underline} President Trump moved boldly in his first
budget, seeking an additional \$54 billion in Pentagon funding for
fiscal year 2018. That figure, by the way, equals the entire military
budgets of allies like Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Japan.
Then, in a bipartisan stampede, Congress egged on Trump to go even
higher, putting forward a defense authorization bill that would raise
the Pentagon's budget by an astonishing \$85 billion. (And don't forget
that, last spring, the president and Congress had already tacked an
extra \$15 billion onto the 2017 Pentagon budget.) The authorization
bill for 2018 is essentially just a suggestion, however \-- the final
figure for this year will be determined later this month, if Congress
can come to an agreement on how to boost the caps on domestic and
defense spending imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The final
number is likely to go far higher than the staggering figure Trump
requested last spring. And that's only the beginning of the good news
for the big weapons companies. Industry officials and Beltway defense
analysts aren't expecting the real increase in Pentagon spending to come
until the 2019 budget. [It's a subject sure to make it into the mid-term
elections. [Dangling]{.mark} potential [infusions of Pentagon funds in
swing states and swing districts is a tried and true way to influence
voters]{.mark} in tight races and so will tempt candidates in both
parties.]{.underline} President [[Trump has long emphasized job creation
above much else]{.underline}]{.mark}, but if he has an actual jobs
program, it mainly seems to involve pumping more money into the Pentagon
and increasing overseas arms sales. That such spending is one of the
least effective ways to create new jobs evidently matters little. [[It
is, after all, an easy and popular way for a president to give himself
the look of stimulating economic activity]{.underline}]{.mark},
especially in an era of steep tax cuts favoring the plutocratic class
and attacks on domestic spending. Trump's much-touted \$1 trillion
infrastructure plan may never materialize, but the Pentagon is already
on course to spend \$6 trillion to \$7 trillion of your taxes over the
next decade. As it happens though, a surprising percentage of those
dollars won't even go into the military equivalent of infrastructure.
Based on what we know of Pentagon expenditures in 2016, up to half of
such funds are likely to go directly into the coffers of defense
contractors rather than to the troops or to basic military tasks like
training and maintenance. While the full impact of
**[Trump's]{.underline}** proposed Pentagon spending increases won't be
felt until later this year and in 2019, he did make a significant impact
last year in his role as **[arms-dealer-in-chief]{.underline}**. Early
estimates for 2017 suggest that arms sales approvals in the first year
of his administration exceeded the Obama administration's record in its
last year in office \-- no mean feat given that President Obama set a
record for overseas arms deals during his eight-year tenure. You
undoubtedly won't be surprised to learn that President Trump greatly
exaggerated the size of his administration's arms deals. Typically
enough, he touted "\$110 billion" in proposed sales to Saudi Arabia, a
figure that included deals already struck under Obama and highly
speculative offers that may never come to fruition. While visiting Japan
in November, he similarly took credit for sales of the staggeringly
expensive, highly overrated F-35 combat aircraft, a deal that was
actually concluded in 2012. To add insult to injury, those F-35s that
the U.S. is selling Japan will be assembled there, not in the good old
U.S.A. (So much for the jobs benefits of global weapons trading.)
Nonetheless, when you peel away the layers of Trumpian bombast and
exaggeration, his administration still posted one of the highest arms
sales figures of the last decade and there's clearly much more to come.
In all of this, the president may not have done major favors for
America's workers, but he's been a genuine godsend for the country's
arms manufacturers. After all, such firms extract significantly greater
profits on foreign deals than on sales to the Pentagon. When selling to
other countries, they normally charge higher prices for weapons systems,
while including costly follow-on agreements for maintenance, training,
and things like additional bombs, missiles, or ammunition that can
continue for decades. In fact, Trump's biggest challenge in accelerating
U.S. arms exports may not be foreign competition, but the fact that the
Obama administration made so many high-value arms deals. Some countries
are still busy trying to integrate the weapons systems or other
merchandise they've already purchased and may not be ready to conclude
new arms agreements. The Good News for Arms Makers: More War [There
are]{.underline}, however, [a number of reasons to think that the major
weapons makers will do even better in the coming years]{.underline} than
they did in the banner year of 2017. Start with America's wars. As
defense expert Micah Zenko of Chatham House explained recently at
Foreign Policy, President Trump has been doubling down on many of the
wars he inherited from Obama. The moves of his administration (peopled,
of course, by generals from those very wars) include the increasing use
of Special Operations forces, a dramatic rise in air strikes, and an
increase in troop levels in conflicts ranging from Afghanistan and Yemen
to Syria and Somalia. It remains to be seen whether the president's
favorite Middle Eastern ally, Saudi Arabia, will be successful in
goading his administration \-- replete with Iranophobes, including
Secretary of Defense James Mattis and CIA Director Mike Pompeo \-- into
taking military action against Tehran. Such calculations have been
complicated by recent anti-government protests there, which the
president and his inner circle hope will lead to regime change from
within. (Trump's crowing about unrest in Iran has, however, been
decidedly unhelpful to genuine advocates of democracy in that country,
given the low esteem in which he's held throughout Iranian society.)
Such far-flung military operations will naturally cost money. Lots of
it. Minimally, tens of billions of dollars; hundreds of billions if one
or more of those wars escalates in an unexpected way \-- as happened in
Afghanistan and Iraq in the Bush years. As a study by the Costs of War
Project at Brown University's Watson Institute recently noted, our
post-9/11 wars have already cost at least \$5.6 trillion when one takes
into account both direct budgetary commitments and long-term
obligations, including lifetime care for the hundreds of thousands of
American veterans who suffered severe physical and psychological damage
in those conflicts. It's important to remember that such immense costs
emerged from what was supposed to be a quick, triumphant war in
Afghanistan and what top Bush administration officials were convinced
would be a relatively inexpensive regime change operation in Iraq and
the garrisoning of that country. (That invasion and occupation was then
projected to cost just a cut-rate \$50 billion to \$200 billion.) Don't
be surprised if the conflicts that Trump has inherited and is now
escalating follow a similar pattern in which actual costs far outstrip
initial estimates, even if not at the stratospheric levels of the Afghan
and Iraq wars, which involved the commitment of hundreds of thousands of
"boots on the ground." All of this spending will again be good financial
news for the producers of combat aircraft, munitions, armored vehicles,
drones, and attack helicopters, among other goods and services needed to
sustain a policy of endless war across significant parts of the planet.
Beyond the hot wars that have involved U.S. troops and air strikes in
Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen, there are
scores of other places where this country's Special Operations forces
are on the ground training local militaries and in many cases
accompanying them on missions that could quickly turn deadly, as
happened to four Green Berets operating in Niger in October 2017. With
Special Ops personnel engaged in a staggering 149 countries last year
and a pledge to step up U.S. activities yet more in Africa \-- there are
already 6,000 U.S. troops and scores of "train and equip" missions on
that continent \-- spending is essentially guaranteed to go up, whatever
the specifics of any given conflict. There are already calls by leading
members of Congress to increase the size of U.S. Special Operations
forces, which, as TomDispatch's Nick Turse notes, already number nearly
70,000 personnel. Boondoggles, Inc. Rest assured, however, that so far
we've only taken a dip in the shallow end of the deep, deep pool of
military spending. Equally important to the bottom lines of Lockheed
Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, General Dynamics, and their
cohorts is the Trump administration's commitment to continue funding
weapons systems the Pentagon doesn't need at prices we can't afford.
Take the F-35 combat plane, a Rube Goldberg contraption once designed to
carry out multiple missions and now capable of doing none of them well.
In fact, as the Project on Government Oversight has pointed out, it's an
aircraft that may never be fully ready for combat. To add insult to
injury, billions more will be spent to fix defects in planes that were
rushed through production before they had been fully tested. The cost of
this "too big to fail" program is currently projected at \$1.5 trillion
over the lifetimes of the 2,400-plus aircraft currently planned for.
This means it is likely to become the most expensive weapons program in
the history of Pentagon procurement. Unfortunately, the F-35 is hardly
the only boondoggle that will continue to pad the coffers of defense
contractors while offering little in the way of defense (no less the
usual offense). A recent estimate from the Congressional Budget Office,
for example, suggests that a projected three-decade Pentagon plan to
build a new generation of nuclear-armed missiles, bombers, and
submarines, initiated under President Obama and close to the heart of
Donald Trump, will cost up to \$1.7 trillion dollars. This stunning
figure includes spending on new nuclear warheads under development at
the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration, one
of many channels for military spending that are outside the Pentagon's
already bloated budget. And given the history of such weapons systems
and the cost overruns that regularly accompany them, keep in mind that
\$1.7 trillion will probably prove a gross underestimate. The Government
Accountability Office, for instance, has released a report suggesting
that the program to build a new generation of ballistic missile
submarines, now priced at \$128 billion, is going to blow past that
figure. In recent years, hawks in Congress have been pressing for more
funding for missile defense and Donald Trump (with the help of "Little
Rocket Man") is their guy. David Willman of the Los Angeles Times
reports that the Trump administration wants to spend more than \$10
billion over the next five years beefing up a deeply flawed project for
placing ground-based missile interceptors in Alaska and California. This
is just one of a number of missile defense initiatives under way. In
2018, Lockheed, Boeing, and General Atomics are also scheduled to test
drones that will reportedly use lasers to shoot down intercontinental
ballistic missiles like those being developed by North Korea. It's a
program that will undoubtedly garner tens of billions of dollars more in
taxpayer funding in the years to come. And Congress isn't waiting until
a final Pentagon budget for 2018 is wrapped up to lavish more money on
missile defense contractors. A stopgap spending bill passed in late
December 2017 kept most programs at current levels, but offered a
special gift of nearly \$5 billion extra for anti-missile initiatives.
In addition, a congressionally financed study of the best place to base
an East Coast missile defense system \-- a favorite hobbyhorse of
Republicans on the House Armed Services Committee that even the Pentagon
has little interest in pursuing \-- is scheduled to be released later
this year. The Congressional Budget Office already suggests that the
price tag for that proposed system would be at least \$3.6 billion in
its first five years of development. Yet deploying it, as the Union of
Concerned Scientists has pointed out, would have little or no value when
it comes to protecting the United States from a missile attack. If the
project moves ahead, it won't be the first time Congress has launched a
costly, unnecessary spending program that the Pentagon didn't even
request. Cybersecurity has been another expanding focus of concern \--
and funding \-- in recent years, as groups ranging from the Democratic
National Committee to the National Security Agency have been hit by
determined hackers. The concern may be justified, but the solution \--
throwing billions at the Pentagon and starting a new Cyber Command to
press for yet more funding \-- is misguided at best. One of the biggest
bottlenecks to crafting effective cyber defenses is the lack of
personnel with useful and appropriate skills, a long-term problem that
short-term infusions of cash will not resolve. In any case, some of the
most vulnerable places \-- from the power grid to the banking system \--
will have to be dealt with by private firms that should be prodded by
stricter government regulations, a concept to which Donald Trump seems
to be allergic. As it happens, though, creating enforceable government
standards turns out to be one of the most important ways of addressing
cybersecurity challenges. [Despite the likely spending spree to come,
[don't expect]{.mark} the Pentagon, the [arms makers, their lobbyists,
or their allies in Congress, to stop crying out for more]{.mark}.
There's always a new weapons scheme or a new threat to hype or another
ill-conceived proposal for a military "solution" to a complicated
security problem. Trillions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of
lives later, the primary lesson from]{.underline} the [perpetual wars
and]{.underline} [profligate [weapons spending]{.mark}]{.underline} of
this century [should be that]{.underline} throwing more
[money]{.underline} at the Pentagon [[isn't making us]{.mark} any
[safer. But translating]{.mark} [that lesson into]{.mark} a [change in
Washington\'s]{.mark} spending patterns [would take major]{.mark} public
[pushback]{.mark} at a level [that has yet to
materialize]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Administration", June 2017, *CNAS*,
<http://drones.cnas.org/reports/drone-proliferation/>)//AA

U.S. Export Policy Informed by the MTCR guidelines and broader concerns
about armed drone proliferation, the United States has limited drone
transfers abroad, particularly of armed drones. The United States has
approved transfers of category I drones, such as the RQ-4 Global Hawk
and MQ-9 Reaper, to a limited number of NATO and major non-NATO allies,
such as Japan, Australia, and South Korea.38 The United States has been
particularly reluctant to transfer armed drones, only authorizing
transfers to Italy and the United Kingdom.39 Even in those narrow cases
to close allies, approval has been fraught. The State Department took
four years to approve Italy's request to purchase armed Reaper drones.40
(As of May 2017 the transfer had been approved, but not yet been
completed.) This hesitation to transfer drones has even extended in some
cases to transfers of unarmed, category II systems to close U.S.
partners. In 2014, the Obama administration rejected Jordan's request to
acquire unarmed Predator XP drones, which fall below the MTCR's
500-kilogram, 300-kilometer category I limit.41 The denial was
particularly surprising given that Jordan receives over \$300 million
annually in foreign military aid from the United States and operates
U.S.-supplied F-16 fighter aircraft.42 Jordan turned to China instead.
Satellite images of a Jordanian air base in 2016 showed a Chinese-made
CH-4 surveillance and strike drone, comparable to a U.S. Reaper.43 When
the United States has held back from transferring drones abroad, even to
key partners, China has stepped in to fill the void. China has
transferred their Reaper-class CH-4 drone to Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and
Iraq. Many of China's sales have been armed. (The MTCR does not
distinguish between armed vs. unarmed drones.) China has sold armed
drones to Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan,
Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan, and the United Arab Emirates.44 In fact,
every international transfer of an armed drone to date with the
exception of the U.S. transfer to the United Kingdom has been from
China. Over time, this is likely to change as the United States and
Israel transfer more armed drones abroad as well. In addition to the
pending U.S. transfer to Italy, Israel reportedly has approved but not
yet delivered transfers of armed drones to Germany and India.45 U.S.
hesitation to transfer drones abroad has not stopped proliferation. It
has, however, weakened U.S. relationships with key partners by forgoing
opportunities to build interoperability and deepen defense relation-
ships. U.S. reluctance to transfer drones abroad also has meant the
United States has missed out on opportunities to shape how others use
drones and influence emerging norms of behavior for drone use. In 2013,
motivated by some of these problems, the United States initiated a broad
review of its approach to drone exports that culminated in the February
2015 U.S. Export Policy for Military Unmanned Aerial Systems.46 The
policy itself was not publicly releasable, but the State Department did
release a fact sheet outlining the basic tenets of the policy. While the
export policy recognized the applicability of existing arms control
agreements, such as the MTCR, it also linked drone transfers to
conditions on their use. Under the new policy, states desiring U.S.
drones would have to agree to abide by "principles for proper use" of
U.S.-origin drones. These principles include complying with applicable
international law, not using drones for unlawful domestic surveillance
or use of force, and encouraging "technical and doctrinal training ...
to reduce the risk of unintended injury or damage." This new policy is a
significant step toward targeted, conditional drone exports to key
partners. The conditions for proper use, along with training on how to
avoid civilian casualties, are key tools for shaping emerging norms for
the responsible use of drones. The United States has not fully
capitalized on these tools to date, however. Despite the official policy
change, the United States still has been reluctant to transfer drones
abroad. [**Various members of Congress** have **spoken out in favor of
increasing targeted drone exports** **to** **key
partners**]{.underline}. In March 2017, [the **Republican** **and**
**Democratic** chairs of the **U.S. Senate** India Caucus sent letters

representatives signed a letter to President Trump asking him to
**permit sal**es of]{.underline} MQ-9 **[Reaper drones]{.underline}**
[to Jordan and the United Arab Emirates]{.underline}.48 (Both the
Guardian and Reaper are Category I MTCR systems, and unarmed Reapers
have been approved for transfer to several NATO and major non-NATO
allies.) [The lawmakers cited **concerns** that countries would turn to
**China instead** for their drone purchases]{.underline} -- concerns
that have materialized in reality.

The [Trump]{.underline} administration [rolled out new
policies]{.underline} on Thursday [designed to bolster the U.S. arms
industry by facilitating more sales to foreign countries]{.underline},
[including provisions that will **loosen restrictions on the export of
American-made drones.**]{.underline} While previous presidents have
taken the U.S. defense industry into consideration when conducting
foreign policy, President [Trump has made arms sales a centerpiece of
his approach]{.underline}, regularly [emphasizing how many weapons a
country buys as a measure of its commitment to Washington.]{.underline}
That emphasis was on display this week during Trump's news conference
with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, in which the [president
promised to "short-circuit" State Department bureaucracy to speed up
sales of U.S. military equipment to allies]{.underline} such as Japan.
"If they're our allies, we are going to help them get this very
important, great military equipment," Trump said. "And nobody --- nobody
--- makes it like the United States. It's the best in the world by far."
[Trump]{.underline} has [often highlighted arms sales while appearing
alongside foreign leaders.]{.underline} In the Oval Office this month,
he described Qatar's emir as a gentleman "who buys a lot of equipment
from us," including military airplanes and missiles. Trump recently
thanked Saudi Arabia's crown prince for sharing the kingdom's wealth
with the United States by purchasing "the finest military equipment
anywhere in the world." For years, U.S. administrations have sought to
balance the interests of the U.S. defense industry with national
security and foreign policy priorities when deciding whether to approve
arms sales. The balancing act can prove tricky because [weapons often
outlast the government that purchased them, and the U.S. military
doesn't want U.S. arms used against its troops in any future
conflict]{.underline}. The U.S. military also wants to retain some of
the most sophisticated American-made technologies for itself to keep an
edge. While it is not yet apparent how the new policy will be
implemented, the [U.S. government plans to stress how proposed deals
benefit the defense industry.]{.underline} The executive branch enjoys a
large amount of discretion on whether to permit an arms sale, but
Congress retains an ultimate right of refusal. More substantive changes
to the rules would require modifications to the law through legislation.

­political-military affairs, said the policy update inserts economic
security "into our broader national security considerations" when
looking at arms transfers. She said the [Trump]{.underline}
administration [would be actively engaged with the U.S. defense industry
to "enable them to make sales overseas."]{.underline} "Overall, [the
approach here]{.underline}, and it's a notable one, [is the
prioritization of the economy]{.underline}," said Rachel Stohl, an arms
trade specialist at the Stimson Center, a nonpartisan policy research
organization in Washington. "It's all about [our economic interests
being as important or maybe even more important than our national
security and foreign policy objectives]{.underline}." Stohl said
previous policies emphasized the need to prevent U.S. arms from ending
up in the hands of bad actors or being used to commit human rights
violations. The new policy retains rules to mitigate such concerns, but
they are no longer the focus, she said. "If you read between the lines,
it could be [a green light for the U.S. to sell more with less
restraint]{.underline}," Stohl said, though apart from [the drone
export]{.underline} changes, she described the [update as more of a
shift in emphasis]{.underline} than a change to the rules. [U.S. sales
already dominate the international market]{.underline}, accounting for
33 percent of all major arms exports and supplying weapons to 103
recipients between 2012 and 2016, according to the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute, or SIPRI, which tallies such
transactions. Russia is second, with about 23 percent of the market. The
U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency late last year announced a 25
percent increase in cleared transactions for fiscal 2017, although many
of those agreements had been initiated under the Obama administration
[In addition to publishing a new policy on conventional arms
transfers]{.underline} --- which the administration will have 60 days to
decide how to implement --- the **[White House and State Department
detailed a separate policy on drone exports.]{.underline}** Part of that
**[drone policy]{.underline}** remained classified. The [**known changes
include a decision to allow U.S. drone exporters to negotiate certain
contracts directly with foreign nations instead of through the
government-run foreign military sales program, which should make it
easier for U.S. defense contractors to negotiate drone sales abroad.**
Another change **eliminates rules that require** special **scrutiny of
sales of drones with laser designators**. Unarmed drones with laser
designators can fly over a battlefield and mark a target, then transmit
the information back to a fighter jet or other system that can launch a
weapon to strike the target.]{.underline} "We are widening the space for
the companies to do their sales and marketing via direct commercial
sales," Kaidanow said. "We're eliminating some of the specific factors
that in the past we looked at when we approved these sales or didn't."
[U.S. dronemakers have long expressed frustration that they face greater
restrictions than foreign competitors such as China when selling their
products to other nations.]{.underline} The companies argue that the
U.S. restrictions haven't prevented the proliferation of drones, as the
Obama administration intended. They say the rules have simply caused
foreign countries that would have bought U.S. equipment, such as Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, to pursue Chinese products instead.
Peter Navarro, director of the White House Office of Trade and
Manufacturing Policy, echoed that argument Thursday. Navarro said the
Obama administration's policy on drone exports accelerated an
undesirable outcome for U.S. manufacturers, with Chinese replicas of
their technology ending up "deployed on the runways in the Middle East."
The Trump administration "is changing that policy," he said. The change
marks a win for allies that have long sought to buy top-of-the-line U.S.
drones but have been stymied by export rules. While the new policy
doesn't ensure they will be able to buy the technology, it represents a
step in that direction. "With key countries in the Middle East, [**this
will be a welcome development** by the Trump
administration]{.underline}," said Danny Sebright, a former Pentagon
official and current president of the U.S.-U.A.E. Business Council.
Still, the revisions fell short of a fuller-scale lifting of
restrictions that some in the U.S. defense industry hope to see. U.S.
drone exports are regulated under the Missile Technology Control Regime,
or MTCR, a voluntary agreement among more than 30 countries, including
the United States. The agreement subjects exports of large drones such
as the popular American-made Predators and Reapers to a "presumption of
denial." China is not a signatory to the agreement. Kaidanow said that
[exports of such large U.S. drones]{.underline} would remain subject to
the "presumption of denial" but that the United States would [work to
update the agreement and ensure that it keeps pace with U.S. priorities
for arms exports.]{.underline} Defense contractors have complained that
the quirks of the agreement make it easier to export a powerful manned
fighter jet from the United States than to sell a far less powerful
drone to another nation. Remy Nathan, vice president of the Aerospace
Industries Association, a defense industry lobby group, cheered the
Trump administration for elevating economic priorities "to their
appropriate position" when deciding whether to approve arms deals. "The
real significance of this announcement is that you have a
presidential-level declaration that defense trade is important," Nathan
said. That laid the groundwork for a conversation between the industry
and the administration over the next 60 days about "some real
fundamental change that needs to happen," he added.

#### Plan unpopular -- White Housing clearing barriers that make drones sales easier

**Muñoz 18** -- Carlo Muñoz is the military correspondent for The
Washington Times focusing on U.S. defense and national security policy,
programs and operations ("\'Buy America\': Trump approves direct
overseas sales of armed U.S. drones", The Washington Times, 04/19/2018,
<https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/apr/19/armed-drones-now-sold-overseas-us-without-pentagon/)//AA>

It's one part of his job that President Trump takes to with an
enthusiasm never matched before in the Oval Office: touting
American-made armaments to potential foreign buyers. The
[Trump]{.underline} administration on Thursday [rolled out an even
bigger "**Open for Business**" sign, streamlining the federal policies
to approve arms sales to foreign governments and announcing a "manager's
special" of **military drones** that U.S. arms companies can for the
first time hawk directly to overseas buyers without the Pentagon's
approval. **White House officials say the move will clear away
unnecessary red tape that made past weapons deals more expensive and
time-consuming**]{.underline}, **[while lifting a ban
that]{.underline}** President [**Obama put into place** three years ago
on the booming drone market.]{.underline} The rules were eased after
U.S. defense companies reported nearly \$42 billion in weapons sales to
foreign partners and allies in fiscal 2017, up almost 20 percent from
the year before, the State Department reported. That total included \$32
billion in foreign military sales, \$6 billion in financing and \$3.8
billion from other sales. Officials said Thursday that the [arms sales
mandates under the "Buy America" initiative will exponentially expand
the nation's already dominant market share]{.underline}. The policy,
which has been in the works for several months, will carve out a role
for the White House and federal government to actively advocate for
sales of U.S.-made weapons to foreign countries. Mr. Trump has not been
shy about prodding foreign leaders to step up their purchases of
American hardware. He brandished an illustrated chart of U.S. tanks,
planes and munitions in the Oval Office recently while hosting the crown
prince of Saudi Arabia, a major purchaser of U.S. weaponry. ["Providing
our allies and partners with greater access to American arms will also
reduce their reliance not just on Chinese knockoffs, but also on Russian
systems]{.underline}," Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump's top trade adviser and
a longtime critic of Beijing, told reporters during a State Department
briefing Thursday. ["For too long, we have hamstrung ourselves and
limited our ability to provide our allies and partners with the
defensive capabilities they require, even when in the U.S.
interest]{.underline}," he said. Nearly 100 countries fly, float and
fight with American-made weapons systems, and U.S. defense firms are the
leading producers of advanced strike aircraft, precision-guided
munitions and missile defense systems. That effort has been spurred by
U.S. defense programs specifically geared toward international
consumption, such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. In February,
Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Tina Kaidanow made an
unusually high-profile appearance at Singapore's international air show,
lending the weight of the administration to U.S. defense firms looking
to gin up business among Asian customers. Such appearances will likely
become the norm under the new arms sales policy. [American diplomats and
military leaders have been touting American arms as a way to promote
better battlefield coordination between U.S. and allied forces rather
than for the economic impact. The new arms policy will essentially flip
that approach and put the fiscal benefits of arms sales to the U.S.
economy at the forefront]{.underline}. It remains unclear whether the
U.S. arms export policy will water down or eliminate the role of human
rights for foreign weapons sales. But U.S. defense firms are lauding the
administration's efforts to aggressively market their products and
expedite their deals. "While these [reform efforts will allow us to
continue to outpace emerging foreign competition, they will continue to
support control mechanisms that protect our most sensitive technologies
and hardware while upholding U.S. human rights and nonproliferation
objectives]{.underline}," officials from the National Defense Industrial
Association said in a statement Thursday. Administration officials want
to further expand the nation's already significant share of the global
arms trade while persuading longtime allies to stick with American
hardware and not shift to Chinese, Russian or Israeli-made rivals. Drone
sales The new policy calls on the Pentagon and the Energy and Commerce
departments to rewrite rules on drone exports. Federal guidelines on the
sales of certain technologies --- such as unmanned aircraft and
long-range missile systems --- include restrictions to ensure purchasers
do not use those weapons against their own people. However, [modified or
dumbed-down versions of those restricted weapons could sidestep the
restrictions while keeping humanitarian concerns intact.]{.underline}
"We look at democracy, at governance, at human rights, at economic
development, at security, at the creation of U.S. jobs and American
prosperity. We look at all those things," Ms. Kaidanow said. [**The
Trump White House is "very, very focused" on ensuring foreign buyers**
who **have access to drones** or other sensitive technologies all adhere
to international norms regarding human rights]{.underline}, she said.
**[The revised drone sales rules will ensure American defense firms
maintain their dominance over China and other competitors in unmanned
technology]{.underline}**, said Mr. Navarro. "Although the U.S. leads
the way in \[drone\] technology, overly restrictive policies enacted by
the previous administration have accelerated an undesirable outcome," he
said. "Already, we are seeing Chinese replicas ... deployed on the
runways in the Middle East." Obama administration officials suspended a
handful of key U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia over concerns about
civilian deaths tied to the Saudi-led operations against Houthi rebels
in Yemen. Riyadh's heavy-handed strategy to defeat the Houthi
separatists, punctuated by a devastating artillery and aerial campaign
that reportedly has included the use of banned cluster bombs, has
generated strong criticism among human rights groups and lawmakers on
Capitol Hill. Critics of the new policy say Mr. Trump is badly
overselling the job-generating benefits of military sales abroad. They
also say the loosened rules call into question other U.S. foreign policy
priorities in the search for more markets and bigger deals. "Rather than
buy into Trump's claims about arms sales generating U.S. jobs, Congress
should do its job by making sure that the commercial interests don't
override the national interest when it comes to arms exports," William
D. Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for
International Policy, wrote in The Hill newspaper Thursday. But Trump
administration officials signed off on a \$1 billion arms deal with
Saudi Arabia in April. The deal included 100 155 mm M109 Howitzers, 180
.50-caliber M2 heavy machine guns, eight Advanced Field Artillery
Tactical Data Systems and three Fire Support Combined Arms Tactical
Trainers for a grand total of \$1.3 billion. It was the second
billion-dollar arms deal signed by the White House with Riyadh since
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's visit to Washington in March.
"America is safer when our partners have access to the American-built
systems they need to defend themselves and our shared interests, and
when American industry competes on a level playing field," White House
press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement.

WASHINGTON ― The [Trump administration has rolled out a new set of
policies governing its exports of military equipment abroad, with a
focus on the idea that "economic security is national
security."]{.underline} But the changes may fall short of what the
defense industry was hoping for, particularly when it comes to the
export of military drones. [The new rules]{.underline}, rolled out April
19, **[create broad new language emphasizing the need to consider
economic benefits when looking at potential weapon exports to partner
nations.]{.underline}** Peter Navarro, White House National Trade
Council head, said this change will allow allies and partners "to more
easily obtain" American security goods, which in turn improves the
security of the Untied States while "reducing" the need for them to buy
Chinese and Russian systems. "For too long we have hamstrung ourselves
and limited our ability to provide our allies and partners with the
defensive capabilities they require, even when in the U.S. interests,"
Navarro said. Tina Kaidanow, principal deputy assistant secretary for
political-military affairs, said the change represents "[efforts to do
things a little bit more strategically. We need to do, the U.S.
government, a better job of strategic advocacy for some of our
companies. We need to think about those areas where we can really enable
sales oversea."]{.underline} Talking to reporters ahead of the
announcement, both noted that there will now be a 60-day period for
feedback from industry, which will help shape potential changes in the
future. However, [the two offered few hard details about what would
change for conventional arms transfers]{.underline}, and Navarro
declined to say what economic impact could potentially be in terms of
jobs or dollar figures. But [industry is excited about the possible
impact]{.underline}. "This is a really big deal. These are issues that
had typically been relegated to the second tier," said Remy Nathan, vice
president of the Aerospace Industries Association. "Credit this
administration, credit \[Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis\] for putting
partnerships in his top three priorities." The U.S. defense industry
continues to dominate on a global scale. According to numbers from the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, American accounted for
34 percent of total arms exports from 2013--17, with 98 countries buying
American goods. The second largest exporter in the world, Russia,
accounted for 22 percent of weapon exports during that same period, with
47 countries as clients; China, the fifth-ranked exporter, represented
only 5.7 percent of global exports, with 48 countries. And while it is
an imperfect measurement, the State Department cleared \$75.9 billion in
potential arms sales in fiscal year 2017, setting a new record. So far
in FY18, State has ok'd over \$55 billion in potential future sales.
Drone changes But where the U.S. is seeing a steep rise in competition
is in the unmanned vehicle sector, particularly from China, who has made
inroads into the traditionally U.S. dominated Middle East with their
cheaper UAVs. With today's announcement, **[the U.S. has made two tweaks
to how it handles drone exports. The first is opening up the opportunity
for companies to sell systems via Direct Commercial Sales process, under
which a company and another nation can directly negotiate, rather than
requiring a more formal Foreign Military Sales process, where the U.S.
government acts as a go-between. DCS sales are seen as faster than FMS
sales.]{.underline}** Secondly, **[the government is eliminating rules
that marked unarmed systems with laser-designator technology as "strike
enabling," which put them in the same category as armed drones, and
hence received higher scrutiny.]{.underline}** Kaidanow said the goal
was to make sure "**[U.S. industry faces fewer barriers and less
confusion]{.underline}** when they are attempting to compete against
other countries and marketing and selling those similar systems to our
partners. " While those changes will be welcomed by the UAV industry, it
falls short of what was expected and hoped for by major producers of
military drones. It had been expected that the new policy would
reinterpret the "strong presumption of denial" clause in the Missile
Technology Control Regime, an international arms control agreement among
35 nations that governs the export of missiles and drones, a second
source explained. The current clause makes it difficult to approve the
sale of category-1 drones capable of carrying 500-kilogram payloads for
more than 300 kilometers. The Obama administration had set a standard of
how it interprets the MTCR language that some in industry have
complained is too strict, and had expected to see changed with this
policy a "presumption of approval" for a specific set of allies and
partners in Europe, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region.
However, changes to the MTCR remain on the table for the long term, with
Kaidanow saying: "We are looking to ensure that the MTCR keeps pace with
the dynamic quality." While she did not explain what changes to the MTCR
may come, American officials in October floated a whitepaper to allies
proposing that any air vehicle that flies under 650 kilometers per hour
would drop to "category-2" and thus be subject to approval on a
case-by-case basis, as opposed to having to follow the more strict
"category-1" policies. Despite fears from nongovernmental organizations
that human rights concerns would be weakened under the new policy, both
Navarro and Kaidanow pushed back at the idea human rights were being
weakened under the new policy, with Kaidanow saying "nothing" had
changed from that regard. Navarro added that the policy continues to
"require enhanced end use monitoring, directing the federal government
to work with partners to reduce civilian casualties in conflict and
championing principals of human rights in international law, including
the law of armed conflict."

#### Drone lobbies will backlash -- the plan undermines a key Trump initiative

**Stone and Spetalnick** **18** -- Mike Stone and Matt Spetalnick
("Exclusive: Trump to boost exports of lethal drones to more U.S. allies
-- sources", Reuters, 3/20/2018,

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald [Trump will soon make it easier
to export some types of lethal U.S.-made drones to potentially dozens
more allies and partners, according to people familiar with the plan.
Trump is expected to ease rules for such foreign sales under a
long-delayed new policy on unmanned military aircraft]{.underline} due
to be rolled out as early as this month, the first phase of a broader
overhaul of arms export regulations. [U.S. drone
manufacturers]{.underline}, facing growing competition overseas
especially from Chinese and Israeli rivals who often sell under lighter
restrictions, [have lobbied hard for the rule changes.]{.underline} The
[White House is expected to tout the move as part of Trump's "Buy
American" initiative to create jobs and reduce the U.S. trade
deficit]{.underline}. Human rights and arms control advocates, however,
[warn it risks fueling violence and instability in regions such as the
Middle East and South Asia.]{.underline} An [announcement of the new
policy has been held up for months **amid deliberations on how far to go
in** **unleashing drones exports**]{.underline}. That delay prompted
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to write to Trump's national security
adviser H.R. McMaster to press him to expedite the policy shift to avoid
losing out on sales to certain countries, an industry source and two U.S
officials said. **[A key thrust of the policy will be to lower barriers
to sales of smaller hunter-killer drones that carry fewer missiles and
travel shorter distances than larger models]{.underline}** such as the
iconic Predator drone, the sources said. Export regulations will also be
eased for surveillance drones of all sizes, they said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. Even though **[Trump will stop short of
completely opening up sales of top-of-the-line lethal drones, it will
mark a major step toward overcoming a long-standing U.S. taboo against
selling armed drones to countries other than a handful of Washington's
most trusted allies.]{.underline}** Military drones have changed the
face of modern warfare, with U.S. models in greatest demand. Trump's
aides had initially focused mostly on devising ways to boost sales of
"eye in the sky" drones used for tracking and targeting. But after a
more than year-long review, they have crafted a plan that will
reinterpret some rules to allow for more armed drone sales overseas. A
list of potential buyers being given fast-track treatment is expected to
expand to include more NATO members, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf
partners as well as treaty allies such as Japan and South Korea, the
people familiar with the plan said. Also likely to be in the favored
group would be key partners such as India, Singapore and Australia as
well as many of the 35 signatories to the Missile Technology Control
Regime (MTCR), an international agreement that sets rules for export of
missiles and related weaponry. The [only sales of armed U.S. drones in
recent years have been to Britain and Italy.]{.underline} "[**We're
getting outplayed** all over the world]{.underline}," a U.S. official
told Reuters. ["Why can our competitors sell to our own allies the
equipment they are clamoring to buy from us? This policy is meant to
turn that around."]{.underline} A Trump administration official,
responding to a request for comment on the story, said the [U.S.
government is seeking to "minimize the self-inflicted bureaucratic and
administrative hurdles to U.S. competitiveness in the global aerospace
markets."]{.underline} The official insisted, however, that [any sales
of armed drones would be in accordance with U.S. law and require that
buyers adhere to international standards.]{.underline} There was no
immediate comment from the White House or Pentagon on the Mattis message
to McMaster.

Five lobbies in one [[Rather than exposing]{.mark} and confronting
[the]{.mark} Israel [lobby]{.mark}, however, [US presidents have]{.mark}
more typically [bent to its will]{.mark}.]{.underline} That was only too
obvious, for example, when Barack Obama folded in his early battle with
Netanyahu to limit the expansion of illegal Jewish settlements in the
West Bank. But [[under Trump, the Israel lobby has come to exercise
unrivalled power]{.mark}**, because it is now far more than just one
lobby. [It is a five-headed Hydra]{.mark}**]{.underline} worthy of Greek
mythology, and only one of its heads relates directly to Israel or
organised American Jewry. In fact, the lobby's power now derives not
chiefly from Israel. Since Trump\'s election, [**[the]{.mark} Israel
[lobby has managed to absorb and mobilise]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}]{.underline}[an additional four **[powerful
lobbies]{.underline}**]{.mark} [-- and to a degree not seen before.
[They are: the Christian evangelicals, the alt-right, the
m]{.mark}ilitary-[i]{.mark}ndustrial [c]{.mark}omplex, [and the
Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [lobby]{.mark}.]{.underline} Domestically[,
**[Trump\'s]{.mark}** election **[victory depended on his ability to
rally to his side]{.mark}** two **[groups]{.mark}** that are profoundly
**[committed to Israel]{.mark}**, even though they are largely
indifferent, or actively hostile, to the Jews who live
there]{.underline}. Leaders of the US alt-right -- a loose coalition of
white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups -- are infatuated with Israel but
typically dislike Jews. That sentiment has been encapsulated by
alt-right leader Richard Spencer, who describes himself as a \"white
Zionist\". In short, the alt-right treasures Israel because it has
preserved a long-discredited model of a fortress-like, belligerent
racial homeland. They want the US reserved exclusively for an imagined
\"white\" community, just as Israel defines itself as representing an
exclusive Jewish community. Trump\'s reliance on the alt-right vote was
highlighted by the early appointment to his administration of several
leading figures associated with the movement, including Steve Bannon,
Stephen Miller, Michael Flynn, Julia Hahn and Sebastian Gorka.
Fulfilling God's prophecy But more significant still has been the role
of evangelicals. That is why Mike Pence, a devout Christian, was chosen
as Trump\'s running mate. Trump\'s team understood that the votes of
tens of millions of Americans were assured if Trump pandered to their
prejudices. And happily for Netanyahu, their keenest prejudice is
fanatical support for Israel -- and not just for Israel inside its
internationally recognised borders, but also for Greater Israel, which
includes many dozens of illegal Jewish settlements built on Palestinian
land. The Christian Zionists believe that Jews must be corralled into
their biblical homeland to fulfil divine prophecy and bring about the
Second Coming of the Messiah. It was primarily for the sake of these
Christian Zionists that Trump moved the US embassy to Jerusalem. And it
was why two evangelical pastors with a history of anti-Semitic remarks,
John Hagee and Robert Jeffress, were called on to offer their blessings
at the opening ceremony. Trump\'s indebtedness to the evangelicals is
one reason to be worried about his policies in the region. The Christian
Zionists have no interest in fairness, justice or international law.
Rather, they are prepared to inflame tensions in the Middle East -- and
even trigger Armageddon itself -- if they think it might benefit Israel
and further God's prophecy. Eisenhower's warning [[The
m]{.mark}ilitary-[i]{.mark}ndustrial [c]{.mark}omplex [has]{.mark}
[enjoyed a]{.mark} much [longer,]{.mark} if [more veiled, influence
on]{.mark} US [politic]{.mark}s]{.underline}. A former US army general
who became president, Dwight Eisenhower, warned of the looming threat
posed by an increasingly dominant corporate sector dependent on war
profits back in 1961. Since then, the power of these corporations has
accreted and expanded in precisely the ways Eisenhower feared. And that
has only helped Israel. [In the early 1980s, Noam Chomsky, the dissident
US intellectual, observed in his book The Fateful Triangle that Israel
and the US had different conceptions of the Middle East. The US was then
what Chomsky termed a \"status quo power\" that was mostly interested in
preserving the existing regional order. Israel, on the other hand, was
committed to destabilisation of the region -- its Balkanisation -- as a
strategy to extend its hegemony over feuding, internally divided
neighbouring states.]{.underline} Today, it is not hard to see which
vision of the Middle East prevailed. [The [US]{.mark}-headquartered [war
industries lobbied for -- and have profited enormously]{.mark} from --
an endless, global \"war on terror\"]{.underline} that needs their
expensive killing toys. The West has even been able to market its wars
of aggression against other sovereign states as \"humanitarian\" in
nature. [The benefits to the military industries can be gauged by
examining the ever-surging profits of large US arms manufacturers such
as Lockheed Martin and Raytheon over the past decade.]{.underline}
Cultivation of fear Israel has not only benefited from the sanctioning
and dismemberment of regional rivals, such as Syria, Iraq and Iran, but
it has exploited the opportunity to make itself indispensable to these
war-profiting industries. It has, for example, [been the linchpin in
developing and refining new ways to exploit the cultivation of fear --
most significantly, the ever-expanding \"homeland security\"
industry.]{.underline} Using the occupied Palestinian territories for
experimentation, [Israel has specialised in developing surveillance and
biometric technologies, lethal and non-lethal crowd control methods,
complex incarceration systems, psychological profiling of subjugated
populations, and highly dubious redefinitions of international
law]{.underline} to lift existing restraints on war crimes and wars of
aggression. [That has proved invaluable to the military industries that
have sought to profit from new wars and occupations across the Middle
East.]{.underline} But it has also meant Israel\'s expertise is much
sought-after by US political and security elites who wish to pacify and
control restless domestic populations. Israel\'s encouragement of the
Middle East\'s destabilisation has raised new threats in the US -- of
protest, immigration and terrorism -- for which Israel has then supplied
readymade solutions. Israel has helped to rationalise the militarisation
of police forces in the US and elsewhere, and provided the training. It
has also gradually introduced to the US and other Western countries the
kind of racial and political profiling that has long been standard in
Israel. That is the reason why Israeli academic Jeff Halper has warned
of the danger that the \"war on terror\" could ultimately turn all of us
into Palestinians. Alliance with Saudi Arabia But [perhaps [the most
significant additional boost to Israel\'s power]{.mark} in Washington
[has been its]{.mark} newfound and barely concealed [alliance with Saudi
Arabia. For decades, the oil lobby in the US was seen as a counterweight
to the Israel lobby]{.mark}]{.underline}[. T]{.mark}hat was why
Israel\'s supporters traditionally reviled the US State Department,
which was viewed as an Arabist outpost. [[No longer. Trump]{.mark}, ever
the businessman, [has cultivated]{.mark} even [stronger ties to the
Saudis, hoping that arms and technology sales will revive the US
economy]{.mark} and his political fortunes.]{.underline} During a visit
by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman to the US in March, Trump
noted: \"Saudi Arabia is a very wealthy nation, and they're going to
give the United States some of that wealth hopefully, in the form of
jobs, in the form of the purchase of the finest military equipment
anywhere in the world.\" But Washington\'s close ties to the Saudis are
increasingly a boon to Israel rather than an impediment. The two have
found common cause in their feverish opposition to Iran, and its Shia
allies in Syria and Lebanon, and their determination to prevent them
from gaining more power in the region. Israel wants a military hegemony
over the Middle East that Iran could undermine, while Riyadh needs an
ideological and financial hegemony that Iran might be able to disrupt.
And the Palestinians -- the only issue that continues formally to divide
Israel and Saudi Arabia -- are increasingly viewed by bin Salman as a
chess piece he is ready to sacrifice in exchange for Iran\'s
destruction. Trump tore up the nuclear accord agreed by Obama with Iran
with such incendiary abandon this month because his two Middle East
allies jointly demanded he do so. And the indications are that he may do
worse -- even attacking Iran -- if the pressure from Israel and the
Saudis reaches a critical mass. Time for a little humility [All of
[these various lobbies]{.mark} have long [wield]{.mark}ed [significant
power in Washington]{.mark}, but remained largely **separate. In recent
years, [their interests have come to overlap]{.mark} considerably,
[making Israel ever more unassailable]{.mark} in US politics. Under
Trump, their agendas have aligned so completely that this multi-headed
lobby has as good as collectively captured the presidency on matters
that concern it most.**]{.underline}

[The wall of silence was broken only with the publication in 2006 of a
seminal essay -- later turned into a book -- by two prominent US
academics, John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt.]{.underline} But in a sign
of the immense weight of the lobby even as it was being dragged into the
light, the pair were unable to find a publisher in the US. Instead, the
essay found a home across the Atlantic in the prestigious, if obscure,
London Review of Books. One of the pair, Stephen Walt, has publicly
admitted that his career suffered as a result. Since then, a little
leeway has opened up on the subject. Even New York Times columnist
Thomas Friedman, a staunch advocate for Israel, has conceded the
lobby\'s existence. [In 2011, he explained a well-established, if
astounding, ritual of US politics: that the [Congress greets every
visiting Israeli pr]{.mark}ime [m]{.mark}inister [more rapturously than
the American president himself]{.mark}. Friedman observed: \"I sure hope
that Israel\'s prime minister, Benjamin [Netanyahu]{.mark}, understands
that the [standing ovation]{.mark} he got in Congress this year [was not
for his politics. That]{.mark} ovation [was bought and paid for by the
Israel lobby]{.mark}.\"]{.underline} Intimidating Congress [Friedman was

American [system that has allowed lobbies]{.mark} and their money [to
dictate the agendas of]{.mark} [most]{.mark} US
[lawmakers]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} Congresspeople are
vulnerable as individuals -- not only to the loss of donations, but to a
generously funded opponent. [In Trump\'s case, the follow-the-money
principle could not have been clearer. In the early stages of his
battle]{.underline} to become the Republican party candidate for
president, when most assumed he stood no chance and he was funding the
campaign himself, [he was relatively critical of Israel.]{.underline}
Hard as it is to believe now, [he promised to be \"neutral\" on the
Israel-Palestine issue; expressed doubts about whether it made sense to
hand Israel billions of dollars annually in military aid; backed a
two-state solution; and refused to commit to recognising Jerusalem as
Israel\'s capital. All of that got ditched the moment he needed big
funders for his presidential bid.]{.underline} The kingmaker in the
Republican party is [Sheldon Adelson, the]{.mark} casino billionaire and
[champion of the]{.mark} kind of [Israeli ultra-nationalist]{.mark},
anti-Arab [politics]{.mark} in which Netanyahu excels. Adelson likes
Netanyahu so much he even bought him a newspaper, Israel Hayom, which
Adelson has grown into the largest-circulation daily in Israel. [In the
end, Adelson [backed Trump\'s election campaign to the tune of
\$35m]{.mark}. It was the need for Adelson\'s support that ensured Trump
appointed David Friedman, a long-time benefactor of the illegal Jewish
settlements in the West Bank, in the supposedly non-partisan position of
US ambassador to Israel.]{.underline} And it was Adelson who was among
the honoured guests at the opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem last
week.

anniversary of the most sensitive day in the Palestinian calendar, Nakba
Day. That is when Palestinians commemorate their mass expulsion from
their homeland in 1948. By relocating the embassy, Trump gave official
US blessing to tearing up the 25-year-old peace process -- and in
choosing Nakba Day for the move, he rubbed the noses of Palestinians,
and by extension the Arab world, in their defeat. [Then, [the White
House]{.mark} compounded the offence by [lauding Israeli snipers who
massacred dozens of unarmed Palestinians]{.mark} protesting at the
perimeter fence around Gaza the same day.]{.underline} A series of
statements issued by the White House could have been written by Israel's

Nations, the US blocked a Security Council resolution calling for the
massacre to be investigated]{.underline}, while Nikki Haley, Trump\'s UN
envoy, observed to fellow delegates: \"No country in this chamber would
act with more restraint than Israel has.\" [[None of these moves served
any obvious US national interest]{.mark}, nor did Trump\'s decision the

been reviled by the Israeli government.]{.underline}

[**What AIPAC wants can be summed up very succinctly: a powerful Israel
free to occupy the territory it chooses**; enfeebled Palestinians; and
unquestioning support for Israel by the United States]{.underline}.
[**[AIPAC is skeptical of negotiations and peace accord]{.mark}s**,
along with the efforts by Israeli doves, the Palestinians, and Americans
to promote them.]{.underline} During the 1980s, when Israel was
aggressively expanding its presence on the West Bank[, AIPAC had a very
close relationship with the Israeli government]{.underline}, especially
the Likud leader Yitzhak Shamir. That quickly changed in 1992, with the
election of Labor\'s Yitzhak Rabin. On a visit to Washington soon after
taking power, he admonished AIPAC for having cozy ties with the Likud.
No longer, Rabin said, would the organization act as Jerusalem\'s
representative in Washington. When Rabin and Arafat signed the Oslo
accords in 1993, AIPAC officially endorsed them, but---in contrast to
its outspoken support of Likud policies---it remained largely silent.
[[Seeing the Palestinians as terrorists who could not be trusted, the
lobby looked]{.mark} for a way [to]{.mark} subtly [undermine the
accords]{.mark}.]{.underline} It found one in the issue of where the US
embassy in Israel should be located. Unlike all but two countries in the
world (Costa Rica and El Salvador), [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[had its embassy not in Jerusalem]{.mark}]{.underline} but in Tel Aviv,
in recognition of Jerusalem\'s contested status. Under the Oslo accords,
the city\'s final disposition was to be taken up in talks set to begin
in May 1996 and to conclude three years later. [But pro-Israel activists
in Congress were unwilling to wait.]{.underline} They got an unexpected
boost in early 1995, when Republicans took control of the House. The new
speaker, Newt Gingrich--- casting about for ways to steer Jewish money
and votes away from the Democrats---announced on a visit to Israel in
January that he was going to support the transfer of the US embassy to
Jerusalem. [In the Senate, Bob Dole, who had never shown much regard for
Israel but who was preparing to challenge Bill Clinton for the
presidency, said at that year\'s AIPAC policy conference that he would
support legislation mandating the transfer. He got a standing ovation.
Both Rabin and Bill [Clinton]{.mark} were [opposed to moving]{.mark} the
embassy. [They knew that such a step, by inflaming the Arab world, could
disrupt the peace process. But for AIPAC and its allies, that was
precisely the point]{.mark}. In October 1995 the Jerusalem Embassy Act
overwhelmingly passed both houses of Congress.]{.underline} The act
mandated the transfer of the embassy to Jerusalem by 1999, unless the
president invoked a national security waiver. [Unwilling to challenge
AIPAC, President Clinton let the bill become law without signing
it.]{.underline} As antici-pated, vehement protests came from every Arab
capital. Clinton duly invoked the waiver, so no transfer occurred, but
every six months his administration had to submit to Congress a report
explaining how it was complying with the law. And members of Congress,
eager to demonstrate their support for Israel, continued to produce a
stream of resolutions and letters demanding the embassy\'s transfer. The
strain on the Oslo accords was intense. It became even more so when
Hillary Clinton decided to run for the Senate in New York. Wanting to
court the all-important Jewish vote, she early on declared Jerusalem
\"the eternal and indivisible capital of Israel,\" and throughout the
remainder of the race she and her Republican opponent Rick Lazio argued
in synagogues and speeches over who would be the quickest to move the
embassy to Jerusalem. By then, Bill Clinton was overseeing the Camp
David peace talks. Every time the issue of the embassy transfer was
mentioned in the news, the Palestinians objected, and America\'s ability
to serve as an honest broker was undermined. \"I wasn\'t thrilled with
their emphasis on moving the embassy,\" recalls Dennis Ross, Clinton\'s
chief negotiator. As he observes, the Israel lobby ultimately did not
succeed---the embassy was never moved---but the semiannual need to
invoke the waiver and report to Congress \"put a burden on us. It took
up a lot of our time.\"

[Any discussion of AIPAC\'s activities must begin with the policy
conference it sponsors each year in Washington, a combination of trade
show, party convention, and Hollywood extravaganza that seems designed
to show AIPAC\'s national power.]{.underline} On Sunday, March 5, 2006,
the start of this year\'s gathering, five thousand pro-Israel activists
from around the country crowded into the Washington Convention Center.
During the next three days, they listened to speeches, sat in on panels,
chatted at receptions, and attended a book signing by Natan Sharansky.
The crowd included more than a thousand college and high school
students, mobilized through AIPAC\'s ambitious campus advocacy program.
Speakers included a cross-section of Washington\'s political
establishment---John Bolton, Newt Gingrich, Senators Evan Bayh and Susan
Collins, House Majority Whip Roy Blunt---as well as all three Israeli
candidates for prime minister (speaking via satellite from Israel, where
they were campaigning). On several giant screens around the hall there
flashed alternating clips of Adolf Hitler denouncing the Jews and
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad vowing to destroy Israel. The show
ended with a fade-out to the post-Holocaust vow \"Never Again.\" [The
next day, members of the conference went to Capitol Hill to lobby for
AIPAC\'s top legislative priority]{.underline}---the Palestinian
Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006. Drafted with AIPAC\'s help following
Hamas\'s recent electoral victory, the bill placed so many restrictions
on aid to, and contacts with, the Palestinian Authority that even the
Israeli government, seeking more flexibility, had expressed some unease
about it.\[2\] Already, though, the bill had more than two hundred
sponsors in the House; now, to press the point, supporters of AIPAC held
meetings in more than 450 congressional offices[. At dinner that night,
AIPAC Executive Director How- ard Kohr, as he does each year, read the
\"roll call\" of dignitaries in attendance. It included a majority of
the Senate, a quarter of the House, more than fifty ambassadors, and
dozens of administration officials. Reciting the names took twenty-seven
minutes in all, with each name greeted by a roar]{.underline}, the
loudest going to Joe Lieberman. The conference ended the next day with a
speech by Dick Cheney. The Vice President used the occasion to deliver
the administration\'s sternest warning yet to the government of Iran,
promising that it would face \"meaningful consequences\" if it continued
to pursue nuclear technology. \"We join other nations in sending that
regime a clear message: We will not allow Iran to have a nuclear
weapon,\" Cheney declared to loud applause. For the AIPAC faithful,
Cheney ranks as a true American hero. For many American Jews, of course,
Cheney is nothing of the sort. On most issues, Jews are quite liberal,
and the issue of Israel is no exception. J.J. Goldberg, the editor of
the Forward, observes that opinion surveys consistently show that \"a
majority of American Jews favor Palestinian statehood, and that a
significant majority favor ceding a significant amount of territory on
the West Bank and withdrawing from the settlements.\" AIPAC claims to
represent most of the Jewish community. Its executive committee has a
couple of hundred members representing a wide spectrum of American
Jewish opinion, from the dovish Americans for Peace Now to the
militantly right-wing Zionist Organization of America. Four times a year
this group meets to decide AIPAC policy. According to several former
AIPAC officials I have talked to, however, the executive committee has
little real power. Rather, power rests with the fifty-odd-member board
of directors, which is selected not according to how well they represent
AIPAC\'s members but according to how much money they give and raise.
[Reflecting this, the board is thick with corporate lawyers, Wall Street
investors, business executives, and heirs to family
fortunes]{.underline}. Within the board itself, power is concentrated in
an extremely rich subgroup, known as the \"minyan club.\" And, within
that group, four members are dominant: Robert Asher, a retired lighting
fixtures dealer in Chicago; Edward Levy, a building supplies executive
in Detroit; Mayer \"Bubba\" Mitchell, a construction materials dealer in
Mobile, Alabama; and Larry Weinberg, a real estate developer in Los
Angeles (and a former owner of the Portland Trail Blazers). Asher, Levy,
and Mitchell are loyal Republicans; Weinberg is a Scoop Jackson Democrat
who has moved rightward over the years. [The \"Gang of Four,\" as these
men are known, do not share the general interest of a large part of the
Jewish community in promoting peace in the Middle East. Rather, **they
seek to keep Israel strong, the Palestinians weak, and the United States
from exerting pressure on Israel.**]{.underline} AIPAC\'s director,
Howard Kohr, is a conservative Republican long used to doing the Gang of
Four\'s bidding. For many years Steven Rosen, AIPAC\'s director of
foreign policy issues, was the main power on the staff, helping to shape
the Gang of Four\'s pro-Likud beliefs into practical measures that AIPAC
could promote in Congress. (In 2005, Rosen and fellow AIPAC analyst
Keith Weissman left the organization and were soon after indicted by
federal authorities for receiving classified national security
information and passing it on to foreign (Israeli) officials.) [AIPAC\'s
defenders like to argue that its success is explained by its ability to
exploit the organizing opportunities available in democratic America. To
some extent, this is true. AIPAC has a formidable network of supporters
throughout the US. Its 100,000 members---up 60 percent from five years
ago ---are guided by AIPAC\'s nine regional offices, its ten satellite
offices, and its one-hundred-person-plus Washington staff, a highly
professional group that includes lobbyists, researchers, analysts,
organizers, and publicists, backed by an enormous \$47 million annual
budget. AIPAC\'s staff is famous on Capitol Hill for its skill in
gathering up-to-the-minute information about Middle Eastern affairs and
working it up into neatly digestible and carefully slanted policy
packages, on which many congressional staffers have come to
rely.]{.underline} Such an account, however, overlooks a key element in
AIPAC\'s success: money[. AIPAC itself is not a political action
committee. Rather, by assessing voting records and public statements, it
provides information to such committees, which donate money to
candidates;]{.underline} [AIPAC helps them to decide who Israel\'s
friends are according to AIPAC\'s criteria.]{.underline} The Center for
Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that analyzes political
contributions, lists a total of thirty-six pro-Israel PACs, which
together contributed \$3.14 million to candidates in the 2004 election
cycle. [Pro-Israel donors give many millions]{.underline} more. Over the
last five years, for instance, Robert Asher, together with his various
relatives (a common device used to maximize contributions), has donated
\$148,000, mostly in sums of \$1,000 or \$2,000 to individual
candidates. A former AIPAC staff member described for me how the system
works. [A candidate will contact AIPAC and express strong sympathies
with Israel. AIPAC will point out that it doesn\'t endorse candidates
but will offer to introduce him to people who do. Someone affiliated
with AIPAC will be assigned to the candidate to act as a contact person.
Checks for \$500 or \$1,000 from pro-Israel donors will be bundled
together and provided to the candidate with a clear indication of the
donors\' political views. (All of this is perfectly legal.) In addition,
meetings to raise funds will be organized in various
cities]{.underline}. Often, the candidates are from states with
negligible Jewish populations. One congressional staff member told me of
the case of a Democratic candidate from a mountain state who, eager to
tap into pro-Israel money, got in touch with AIPAC, which assigned him
to a Manhattan software executive eager to move up in AIPAC\'s
organization. The executive held a fund-raising reception in his
apartment on the Upper West Side, and the candidate left with \$15,000.
In his state\'s small market for press and televised ads, that sum
proved an important factor in a race he narrowly won. The congressman
thus became one of hundreds of members who could be relied upon to vote
AIPAC\'s way. (The staffer told me the name of the congressman but asked
that I withhold it in order to spare him embarrassment.) **[Conversely,
candidates who challenge AIPAC can find their funds suddenly dry
up.]{.underline}** Two well-publicized cases are those of
Representatives Cynthia McKinney of Georgia and Earl Hilliard of
Alabama, both African-Americans. In 2002, McKinney and Hilliard were
alleged to have made statements or taken positions critical of Israel,
and their primary opponents received large amounts of pro-Israel money.
Both candidates had limited public support and ended up losing. Cases
such as these occur infrequently: a candidate\'s position on Israel is
rarely enough by itself to cause defeat. But it can have a very large
effect on fund-raising. (McKinney was reelected to Congress in 2004.) In
1981, after leaving the Senate, Adlai Stevenson III decided to run for
governor of Illinois. In the late 1970s, Stevenson had introduced an
amendment to an appropriations bill in the Senate that would have cut US
aid to Israel by \$200 million until such time as the president could
certify that Israel\'s settlements policy was consistent with US policy.
The amendment failed, but, as Stevenson told me, \"the Israeli lobby
lowered the boom. The money dried up.\" The campaign, he told me, became
demoralized, and his poll ratings dropped. In the end the race was so
close that it was finally decided by the Illinois Supreme Court in favor
of his opponent, Jim Thompson. The drop in funds, Stevenson says, \"was
critical.\" Cases such as this \"happen almost once a year,\" I was told
by a Democratic congressman (who asked not to be named). Emphasizing
that Israel \"is never the sole thing\" that causes a defeat, he
proceeded to give a list of several politicians who had suffered because
they had offended AIPAC. They include Tony Beilenson in Los Angeles
(because he had wanted to divert one percent of all US foreign
aid---including aid to Israel---to help drought victims in sub-Saharan
Africa); John Bryant of Texas (for seeking to withhold funds in order to
protest Israel\'s settlements policy); and James Moran of Virginia, who
found that his anticipated election funds dropped several tens of
thousands of dollars after he said at a town meeting in 2003 that the
Iraq war would not have been fought had it not been for the strong
support of the Jewish community. (Both Bryant and Moran won anyway.)
This year, pro-Israel forces are targeting Senator Lincoln Chafee of
Rhode Island. A Republican, Chafee has taken a number of positions that
run counter to AIPAC\'s, including a vote against the Syria
Accountability Act, which prepared the way for US sanctions against that
country. His challenger in the Republican primary, Stephen Laffey, has
taken a strong pro-Israel position, and already he has received \$5,000
(the maximum allowed) from the pro-Israel Washington Political Action
Committee. In a recent report, the Forward noted that a Providence
lawyer and pro-Israel activist named Norman Orodenker was preparing to
send out a letter to other pro-Israel PACs praising Laffey\'s lifelong
record of support for Israel. [Democrats, though, still get most of the
pro-Israel dollars.]{.underline} Among AIPAC\'s staunchest backers in
Congress are such well-known liberals as Nancy Pelosi, Henry Waxman,
Jerrold Nadler, and Howard Berman. Steny Hoyer, the House minority whip,
is so reliable that \"he might as well be on the AIPAC payroll,\" a
congressional staffer told me. Hillary Clinton is equally dependable.
Still attempting to live down her 1998 declaration of support for a
Palestinian state and the kiss she gave Suha Arafat in 1999, Clinton has
sought to compensate by voting AIPAC\'s way on almost every issue. In
the current election cycle, she has received \$80,000 in pro-Israel
money---more than any other congressional candidate. **[Partly as a
result of such giving, says one Hill staffer, \"We can count on well
over half the House---250 to 300 members---to do reflexively whatever
AIPAC wants.\"]{.underline}**

The [Trump]{.underline} administration has [approved six authorizations
for U.S. companies to conduct nuclear-related work with Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}, Energy Secretary Rick Perry confirmed Thursday.
[The move has raised concerns on Capitol Hill]{.underline}. [Democratic
lawmakers]{.underline}, in particular, [are worried about the kingdom
pursuing a nuclear weapon]{.underline} and about the lack of
congressional oversight on the agreements. These authorizations, known
as Part 810s, are required for companies to export nuclear technology or
to help develop nuclear facilities or material in foreign countries. But
while they\'re often open to public review, these companies have
requested that these six not be open. There\'s growing concern about a
Middle East nuclear arms race after Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman told CBS News last year he\'d pursue a nuclear weapon if Iran had
one. Lawmakers are also concerned whether any of the authorizations were
inked after the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in
October. \"If you cannot trust a regime with a bone saw, you should not
trust them with nuclear weapons,\" Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., told
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday, making a reference to the
weapon reportedly used to help dispose of Khashoggi\'s body after his
gruesome death. On Thursday, [Perry]{.underline} downplayed his approval

Yemen And how the U.S. could stop weapon sales if it wanted to."

[[Under]{.mark}]{.underline} President Barack
[[Obama]{.underline}]{.mark}'s administration [[and]{.mark},
now]{.underline}, President Donald [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}'s, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has put its military might
behind the Saudi-led coalition,]{.underline} waging a war without
congressional authorization. That war has devastated Yemen's
infrastructure, destroyed or damaged more than half of Yemen's health
facilities, killed more than 8,350 civilians, injured another 9,500
civilians, displaced 3.3 million people, and created a humanitarian
disaster that threatens the lives of millions as cholera and famine
spread through the country. **[[U.S. arms]{.mark}
[merchants]{.mark}]{.underline}**, however, **[[have grown
rich]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Fragments of the bombs were documented by
journalists and HRW with help from Mastaba villagers. An HRW munitions
expert determined the bombs were 2,000-pound MK-84s, manufactured by
General Dynamics. Based in Falls Church, Va., General Dynamics is the
world's sixth most profitable arms manufacturer. One of the bombs used a
satellite guidance kit from Chicago-based Boeing, the world's
second-most profitable weapons company. The other bomb had a Paveway
guidance system, made by either Raytheon of Waltham, Mass., the
third-largest arms company in the world, or Lockheed Martin of Bethesda,
Md., the world's top weapons contractor. An In These Times analysis
found that in the past decade, the State Department has approved at
least \$30.1 billion in Saudi military contracts for these four
companies. The war in Yemen has been particularly lucrative for [General
Dynamics, Boeing and Raytheon]{.underline}, which [have received
hundreds of millions of dollars in Saudi weapons deals]{.underline}. All
three corporations have highlighted business with Saudi Arabia in their
reports to shareholders. Since the war began in March 2015, General
Dynamics' stock price has risen from about \$135 to \$169 per share,
Raytheon's from about \$108 to more than \$180, and Boeing's from about
\$150 to \$360. Lockheed Martin declined to comment for this story. A
spokesman for Boeing said the company follows "guidance from the United
States government," while Raytheon replied, "You will need to contact
the U.S. government." General Dynamics did not respond to inquiries. The
State Department declined to comment on the record. The **[weapons
contractors are]{.underline}** correct on one point: They're **[[working
hand-in-glove with the State Department]{.underline}]{.mark}**. By law,
the department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs must approve any
arms sales by U.S. companies to foreign governments. U.S. law also
prohibits sales to countries that indiscriminately kill civilians, as
the Saudi-led military coalition bombing Yemen did in the Mastaba strike
and many other documented cases. But **[[ending sales]{.mark} to Saudi
Arabia would [cost the]{.mark} U.S. arms [industry]{.mark} its biggest
global customer, and [to do so, Congress must cross an industry that
pours millions into the campaigns of lawmakers of both
parties]{.mark}]{.underline}**. THE CIVILIAN DEATH TOLL Saudi coalition
spokesperson Gen. Ahmed al-Assiri told the press that the Mastaba market
bombing targeted a gathering of Houthi fighters. But because the attack
was indiscriminate, in that it hit both civilians and a military target,
and disproportionate, in that the 97 civilian deaths would outweigh any
expected military advantage, HRW charged that the missile strikes
violated international law. According to an In These Times analysis of
reports by HRW and the Yemeni group Mwatana for Human Rights, the
Saudi-led coalition (including the United Arab Emirates \[UAE\], a Saudi
ally that is also bombing Yemen) has used U.S. weapons to kill at least
434 people and injure at least 1,004 in attacks that overwhelmingly
include civilians and civilian targets. "Most of the weapons that we
have found and been able to identify in strikes that appear unlawful
have been U.S. weapons," Motaparthy says. "Factories have been hit.
Farmlands have been hit with cluster bombs. Not only have they killed
civilians, but they have also destroyed livelihoods and contributed to a
dire humanitarian situation." "The \[U.S. government is\] now on notice
that there's a high likelihood these weapons could be used in strikes
that violate the laws of war," Motaparthy says. "They can no longer say
the Saudis are targeting accurately, that they have done their utmost to
avoid civilian casualties." According to the Foreign Assistance Act of
1961, the United States may not authorize arms exports to governments
that consistently engage in "gross violations of internationally
recognized human rights." The Arms Export Control Act of 1976 stipulates
that exported weapons may only be used for a country's defense. "When a
country uses U.S.-origin weapons for other than legitimate self-defense
purposes, the administration must suspend further sales, unless it
issues a certification to Congress that there's an overwhelming national
security need," says Brittany Benowitz, a former defense adviser for
former Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.). "The Trump administration has not
done that." A HUNDRED-BILLION-DOLLAR CLIENT Over the past decade, Saudi
Arabia has ordered U.S.-made offensive weapons, surveillance equipment,
transportation, parts and training valued at \$109.3 billion, according
to an In These Times analysis of Pentagon announcements, contracts
announced on defense industry websites and arms transfers documented by
the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. That arsenal is
now being deployed against Yemen. Saudi Arabia's precision-guided
munitions are responsible for the vast majority of deaths documented by
human rights groups. In These Times found that, since 2009, Saudi Arabia
has ordered more than 27,000 missiles worth at least \$1.8 billion from
Raytheon alone, plus 6,000 guided bombs from Boeing (worth about \$332
million) and 1,300 cluster munitions from Rhode Island-based Textron
(worth about \$641 million). About \$650 million of those Raytheon
orders and an estimated \$103 million of the Boeing orders came after
the Saudi war in Yemen began. Without these ongoing American-origin
weapons transfers, the Saudi coalition's ability to prosecute its war
would wither. "We can stop providing munitions, and they could run out
of munitions, and then it would be impossible to keep the war going,"
says Jonathan Caverley, associate professor at the U.S. Naval War
College and a research scientist at M.I.T. The warplanes the United
States delivers also need steady upkeep. [Since the war began, the
Saudis have struck deals worth \$5.5 billion with war contractors for
weapons maintenance, support and training]{.underline}. "The Saudi
military has a very sophisticated, high-tech, capital-intensive military
that requires almost constant customer service," Caverley says. "And so
most of the planes would be grounded if Lockheed Martin or Boeing turn
off the help line." "JUST A PILIING UP OF STUFF" The U.S.-Saudi
relationship has its roots in the 1938 discovery of oil in Saudi Arabia,
and President Franklin Roosevelt's energy-for-security deal with the
Saudi monarchy. Today, in addition to oil, U.S.-Saudi relations are
cemented by a geopolitical alliance against Iran---and by weapons deals.
Arms exports accelerated under Obama. By 2016, his administration had
offered to sell \$115 billion in weapons and defensive equipment to
Saudi Arabia---the most of any administration in history. Those arms
exports "used to be more of a symbolic thing, just piling up the stuff,"
says William Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the
Center for International Policy. But experts also say selling the Saudis
so many arms incentivized the Arab monarchy to use them in devastating
fashion. "If a country, like Saudi Arabia or the UAE, has no commitment
to human rights---whether stated or in practice---it's no wonder that
those countries would eventually misuse U.S.-sold weapons by committing
war crimes," says Kate Kizer, the policy director of Win Without War.
"The U.S. government should be assuming these weapons of warfare will
eventually be used in a conflict, even if one isn't going on at the
moment." With the Saudi invasion of Yemen in 2015, the U.S.-Saudi arms
pipeline became deadly. [Despite reports that U.S. bombs were killing
civilians, the Obama administration's support for the Saudi war drew
only muted criticism in Washington]{.underline}. "It was Obama's war,
and there was a lot of reluctance in Congress to take this on,
particularly among Democrats," says Shireen Al-Adeimi, a Yemeni American
activist and professor at Michigan State University. Still, advocates
with groups like Win Without War, Just Foreign Policy and the Yemen
Peace Project worked to raise public awareness of the war's horrors,
lobbying Congress and the White House. In May 2016, Obama canceled the
delivery of 400 Textron cluster bombs to Saudi Arabia. In December 2016,
two months after a Saudi airstrike hit a funeral hall and killed more
than 100 people in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, he halted the sale of
16,000 precision guided bombs from Raytheon, a deal worth \$350 million.
Those two decisions accounted for only a fraction of overall arms sales
to the Saudis, and the flow of most weapons continued unchecked. TRUMP'S
BIG PHOTO OPP When Trump took office in January 2017, he made it a
priority to strengthen the U.S.-Saudi relationship, which had taken a
hit after Obama's nuclear deal with Iran. As part of that bid, Trump
reversed Obama's decision to halt the \$350 million Raytheon order.
Trump's first overseas visit, in May 2017, was to Saudi Arabia, a jaunt
to strengthen the alliance against Iran and get Saudi Arabia to sign on
to Trump's plans for an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. During that
visit, the United States agreed to sell Saudi Arabia \$110 billion
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} American weapons, with an option for a total
of \$350 billion over the next decade. Trump boasted his deals would
bring 500,000 jobs to the United States, but his own State Department
put the figure at tens of thousands. On May 20, [[2017,]{.mark}
Trump]{.underline} and King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud [presided over
Boeing's and Raytheon's signings of M]{.underline}emorandums
[o]{.underline}f [A]{.underline}greement [with Saudi Arabia for future
business]{.underline}. Raytheon used the opportunity to open a new
division, Raytheon Saudi Arabia. "This strategic partnership is the next
step in our over 50-year relationship in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"
Raytheon CEO Thomas A. Kennedy told shareholders. "Together, we can help
build world-class defense and cyber capabilities." [The ink was barely
dry before \$500 million of the deal was threatened by [a bill]{.mark},
introduced by]{.underline} Sen. Rand [Paul]{.underline} (R-Ky.) in May
2017, [[to block the sale of bombs to Saudi Arabia. In response, Boeing
and Raytheon hired lobbying firms to make their case]{.underline}. [In
the end, five Democrats]{.underline}]{.mark}---Joe
[Donnelly]{.underline} (Ind.), Claire [McCaskill]{.underline} (Mo.), Joe
[Manchin]{.underline} (W.Va.), Bill [Nelson]{.underline} (Fla.)
[and]{.underline} Mark [Warner]{.underline} (Va.)---[[broke with their
party to ensure arms sales continued]{.underline}]{.mark}, in a 53-47
vote. [[The five had collectively received tens of thousands in arms
industry donations]{.underline},]{.mark} and would receive another
\$148,032 in the next election cycle from the PACs and employees of
Boeing and Raytheon. Nelson and McCaskill pulled in \$44,308 and
\$57,230, respectively[. Weapons firms are aided by a revolving door
with the Trump administration]{.underline}. Then-Defense Secretary Jim
Mattis, a former General Dynamics board member, warned Sen. Lindsey
Graham (R-S.C.) that the Rand Paul bill would be a boon for Iran. Acting
Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan served as a senior vice president of
Boeing prior to coming to the Defense Department, though it's unclear
whether he's championed U.S.-Saudi arms deals. The Wall Street Journal
reports that, in 2018, State Department staff, voicing concerns about
the war on Yemen, asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo not to certify
that civilian deaths were being reduced. Their concerns were overridden
by the department's Bureau of Legislative Affairs, which argued such a
move could put billions of dollars in future arms sales in jeopardy. The
bureau is led by Charles Faulkner, a former Raytheon lobbyist. CONGRESS
WAKES UP In October 2018, the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia took
center stage in Washington, when Saudi agents murdered and dismembered
journalist Jamal Khashoggi in their country's consulate in Istanbul.
Khashoggi, a Saudi Washington Post columnist, had been critical of Saudi
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The murder forced Congress to reckon
with Salman, who, as defense minister, had launched the Saudi war on
Yemen alongside a vicious crackdown on human rights activists. Suddenly,
leading members of Congress, including Graham and other defenders of the
U.S.-Saudi relationship, were alarmed at the prospect of selling more
arms to Salman. "The Khashoggi murder really broke the dam on
congressional outrage about what the administration's conduct has been
\[toward Saudi Arabia\]," says Kate Gould, former legislative director
for Middle East policy at the Friends Committee on National Legislation.
This spring, the Senate and House passed a bill championed by Sen.
Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) requiring the
United States to stop giving the Saudi coalition intelligence and to
prohibit the in-air refueling of Saudi warplanes. It was the first time
in U.S. history that both chambers of Congress invoked the War Powers
Act, designed to check the president's war-making powers by requiring
congressional authorization to deploy troops overseas. Trump vetoed the
bill on April 16. Arms expert William Hartung says the current political
climate makes new deals unlikely: "It'd be very difficult \[right now\]
to push a substantial sale of offensive weapons like bombs. Anything
that can be used in the war is probably a non-starter." Still, billions
of dollars of approved weapons are already in the pipeline. If
congressional anger at the Saudis wanes, the arms spigot could reopen.
[In February, a bipartisan group of senators]{.underline}---including
Graham and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.)---[introduced]{.underline} the Saudi
Arabia Accountability [an]{.underline}d Yemen [Act]{.underline} of 2019,
[which would halt future sales]{.underline} of ammunition, tanks,
warplanes and bombs, and suspend exports of bombs that had been given a
prior green light. Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) wants to go even further.
In January, he introduced legislation that would ban all weapons exports
to Saudi Arabia, as well as maintenance and logistical support. The bill
has 29 cosponsors (most of them Democrats). "The bottom line is: We know
for a fact that they're bombing school buses, bombing weddings, bombing
funerals, and innocent people are being murdered," McGovern told In
These Times. "The question now is: Are we going to just issue a press
release and say, 'We're horrified,' or is there going to be a
consequence?" McGovern says that if a measure like his is not passed,
"other authoritarian regimes around the world will say, 'Hey, we can do
whatever the hell we want.'" **[[To pass such bills, Congress members
will have to muscle past the arms industry.]{.underline}]{.mark}** In
Lockheed Martin's 2018 annual report, the company warned, "Discussions
in Congress may result in sanctions on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia." For
Jehan Hakim of the Yemeni Alliance Committee, [[the ongoing war comes
down to the influence of money in Washington]{.underline}]{.mark}. "We
talk to family back home \[in Yemen\] and the question they ask is,
'Why? Why is the U.S. supporting the Saudi coalition?'" Hakim says.
"Profiteering is put before the lives of humans."

[Earlier this month, [Congress passed a historic resolution to end U.S.
involvement in]{.mark} the [Yemen]{.mark} war, sending a harsh rebuke of
the Saudi-led coalition that has helped cause the world's worst
humanitarian crisis. But on Tuesday, President [Trump vetoed the
resolution]{.mark}]{.underline} --- a move that was expected but still
disappointing. It's abundantly clear that the United States shouldn't be
supporting the Saudi-led coalition, which has repeatedly used U.S.
weapons in attacks that have killed civilians and even secretly
partnered with al-Qaeda militants in Yemen, leading to a resurgence of
the terrorist organization responsible for 9/11. So why would Congress
take so long to pass something so clearly in America's interests ---
[and **[why]{.mark} would Trump veto it?** There's a simple answer**:
[the extraordinary influence of the Saudi lobby]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
According to a new report from the Foreign Influence Transparency
Initiative, which I direct, [[firms]{.underline}]{.mark} registered
under the Foreign Agents Registration Act [have [reported receiving more
than \$40 million from Saudi Arabia in 2017 and 2018]{.mark}. Saudi
l[obbyists and p]{.mark}ublic [r]{.mark}elations [professionals have
contacted Congress, the executive]{.mark} branch, [media outlets and
think tanks more than 4,000 times]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Much of
this work has been focused on ensuring that sales of U.S. arms to Saudi
Arabia continue unabated and blocking congressional actions that would
end U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. [Lobbyists,
lawyers and public relations firms working for [the Saudis have]{.mark}
also [reported doling out more than \$4.5 million in campaign
contributions in the past two years]{.mark}, including at least \$6,000
to Trump. In many cases, these contributions have gone to members of
Congress they've contacted regarding the Yemen wa]{.underline}r. In
fact, some contributions have gone to members of Congress on the exact
same day they were contacted by Saudi lobbyists, and some were made to
key members just before, and even on the day of, important Yemen votes.
For example, on Nov. 14, registered Saudi foreign agents at the McKeon
Group --- whose chief executive and namesake, Howard "Buck" McKeon, was
the former chairman of the House Armed Services Committee --- reported
meeting with Sen. James M. Inhofe's (R-Okla.) military legislative
assistant to discuss the kingdom and making a \$1,000 contribution to
Inhofe's campaign that same day. Two weeks later, Inhofe voted against a
resolution to end U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen and
vehemently opposed the Senate's passage of the bill this year. Earlier
in 2018, on May 16, Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) and his chief of staff
reportedly met a registered Saudi foreign agent with Brownstein Hyatt
Farber Schreck to discuss the Yemen resolution and received a \$500
contribution from BHFS lobbyist Elizabeth Gore that same day. Two months
earlier, on March 20, Menendez voted to table a motion to end U.S.
involvement in the Yemen war. Menendez also received a contribution from
Squire Patton Boggs, another firm representing the Saudis, days before
the vote. Similarly, just eight days before the vote, Sen. Heidi
Heitkamp (D-N.D.) received a \$1,000 contribution from the Glover Park
Group, which was on the Saudi payroll at the time. (They dropped Saudi
Arabia as a client in October.) And, in the four days before the March
20 vote, Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), received \$3,000 in campaign
contributions from BHFS, including one contribution on the same day of
the vote. All of these were key swing votes that were pivotal in keeping
the United States in the Yemen war.

#### Saudi lobby outweighs

*TIME Magazine,* "What Makes the U.S.-Saudi Relationship So Special?
Weapons, Oil and \'An Army of Lobbyists,'" published October 18^th^,

accessed 7/3/19, JME.)

[It's a cold financial calculation: Saudi money for U.S.-made weaponry
results in American [jobs. This is]{.mark} President Donald [Trump's
rationale in **dismissing calls in Congress to halt**]{.mark} **future
arms [sales to Saudi]{.mark} [Arabia]{.mark}** following the mysterious
disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi]{.underline}, the Saudi journalist and
American resident. "[I don't like the concept of stopping an investment
of \$110 billion into the United States," Trump said]{.underline} last
week. "All they're going to do is say, 'That's OK. We don't have to buy
it from Boeing. We don't have to buy it from Lockheed. We don't have to
buy it from Raytheon and all these great companies. We'll buy it from
Russia. We'll buy it from China," he said. [[The 75-year
alliance]{.mark} between the two nations [has been built on a simple
arrangement: American demand for Saudi oil and Saudi demand for]{.mark}
American [firepower. **It is a relationship that is not easily
unwound**]{.mark} as a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators found out
earlier this year when they moved to cut off military assistance to the
Saudis in their war against Houthi rebels in Yemen]{.underline}. The
United Nations has said that more half of the more than 10,000 people
who have been killed in the three-year old war are civilians, and the
lives of millions are potentially at risk from famine. The U.S.
government has provided intelligence, munitions and midair refueling to
Saudi warplanes since operations kicked off in 2015. [Attempts by
American lawmakers to stop that aid have thus far failed. [Saudi Arabia
has spent]{.mark} at least \$5.8 million on lobbying Congress this year,
according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, a
government watchdog. But **recently filed documents** detailing expenses
and reimbursements **put the actual number [close]{.mark}r [to \$9
million]{.mark}**]{.underline}, said Lydia Dennett, investigator with
the Project [on]{.mark} Government Oversight. "[The Kingdom has [a
veritable army of lobbyists]{.mark} and PR firms working to promote
their interests in a wide variety of ways]{.underline}," she said. The
Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative, a left-leaning think tank in
Washington, recently compiled records filed under Foreign Agents
Registration Act that show in 2017 Saudi lobbyists contacted over 200
members of Congress, including every Senator. [The [data]{.mark} also
[found]{.mark} the [Saudi agents contacted officials in]{.mark} the
[State]{.mark} Department,]{.underline} which oversees foreign military
sales, [[nearly 100 times. The Saudi-U.S. relationship is peerless when
it comes to arms sales]{.underline}]{.mark}. The kingdom buys more
American weapons than any other nation. [Saudi Arabia accounted for
nearly one-fifth of American of all weapons exports over the past five
years]{.underline}, according to a recent report by the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute. The Pentagon has a team of U.S.
service members based out of the capital Riyadh wholly dedicated the
"management and administration of Saudi Arabian Foreign Military Sales."
It serves as a direct pipeline to move weapons from U.S. arms
manufacturers into the arms of the Saudi military. The U.S. military's
Joint Advisory Division works alongside commanders in each branch of the
Saudi military to help fill their weapons needs. Once the Saudis commit
to what they want --- tanks, attack helicopters, missiles, ships,
laser-guided bombs --- the arms packages must be OK'd by the U.S.
Defense and State Departments, and approved by Congress. The arrangement
falls under the U.S. Military Training Mission to Saudi Arabia, which is
led by a two-star American general. The mission is primarily designed to
bolster Saudi Arabia against arch-rival Iran in order to assert power
and influence in the Middle East. "We have other very good allies in the
Middle East, but if you look at Saudi Arabia: They're an ally and
they're a tremendous purchaser of not only military equipment, but other
things," Trump said Wednesday in the Oval Office. It was the President's
latest attempt to trumpet \$400 billion in business deals that his
administration signed in May 2017 during a two-day visit to Saudi
Arabia. The eye-popping figure includes \$110 billion in military sales,
which analysts point out is misleading because it represented letters of
interest and not firmed-up contracts. Saudi Arabia has thus far only
committed to purchase \$14.5 billion-worth of equipment since the
announcement was made 17 months ago. The Administration says the Saudis
are currently pursuing more than \$114 billion in military hardware. But
even if the kingdom moves forward with the sales, the transactions
wouldn't be worth it, according to William D. Hartung, director of the
arms and security project at the Center for International Policy. "Jobs
are no excuse for arming a regime with Saudi Arabia's dismal human
rights record, whether it is its role in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi
or its indiscriminate bombing of civilians in Yemen," he said. The
Khashoggi case has caused an escalating debate on Capitol Hill over the
U.S.-Saudi relationship. Lawmakers on both sides have called for a
reappraisal if the kingdom is found responsible for Khashoggi's
disappearance or death. James Carafano, a vice president at the Heritage
Foundation, a conservative think tank, says it's critical that
Washington doesn't rush policy changes on such an enduring alliance
until the facts are clear. "This isn't an episode of 'Law & Order.' This
is a murder investigation and a murder investigation takes a lot of
time," he said. [The Trump Administration has repeatedly called for
patience]{.underline}. On Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told
reporters outside the White House that the U.S. will give Saudi Arabia a
"few more days" to "conduct a complete, thorough investigation." "We're
all going to get to see the response from Saudi Arabia to this," he
said. "When we see that, we'll get a chance to determine---all of us
will get a chance to make a determination as to the credibility of the
work that went into that, whether it's truly accurate, fair, and
transparent in the very way they made a personal commitment to me, and
ultimately made a personal commitment to the president when they spoke
to him." Before taking the short walk back into the White House, he
added that Saudi Arabia was also "an important strategic alliance of the
United States. We need to be mindful of that as well."

#### The link outweighs the turn---no matter how much congressional momentum there is, the lobby stays ahead

**Freeman 18** (Ben, director and founder of the Foreign Influence
Transparency Initiative at the Center for International Policy, *The
Washington Post,* "It's time to silence the Saudi lobbying machine in
Washington," published October 22^nd^ 2018,

[[Before]{.mark} the horrific murder of Jamal [Khashoggi]{.mark} in the
Saudi Consulate in Turkey, [Saudi]{.mark} Arabia had [amassed one of the
largest]{.mark} and well-funded [influence operations in the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates. It had more than two dozen lobbying and
public relations firms on its payroll. Its lobbyists lined congressional
campaign coffers on the very same day they met with senators and
representatives to discuss Saudi interests, and the Saudis were pumping
cash into think tanks and elite American universities across the nation.
But [now the Saudi's]{.mark} once seemingly [invincible]{.mark}
influence [machine has started to malfunction]{.mark}]{.underline}. Four
of Saudi Arabia's lobbying and public relations firms, and at least one
think tank, have severed ties with the Saudis. The question isn't why
organizations are distancing themselves from Saudi Arabia now; the real
question is why did Washington wait to sour on the Saudis? The short
answer: the Saudis' extraordinary spending on influence in the United
States. The story of the rise of Saudi influence in Washington begins
after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when it was revealed that
15 of the 19 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia. In the next 10 years, the
Saudis spent more than \$100 million to reshape their image in
Washington. They were so successful that the Obama administration ---
while negotiating the Iran deal that the Saudis opposed --- offered
Saudi Arabia \$115 billion in arms sales, far more than any
administration in U.S. history. These are the same arms deals that
President Trump keeps falsely claiming credit for and is using as a
completely misguided justification for not punishing the Saudis for
Khashoggi's death. While becoming the leading recipient of U.S. arms
sales just 15 years after being implicated in the most devastating
terrorist attack on U.S. soil might seem surprising, the Saudi lobby was
only getting started. In 2016, the Saudi government was fighting the
Justice Against State Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA), which
effectively would allow for the families of 9/11 victims to continue
with a lawsuit against Saudi Arabia. To fight JASTA, Saudi Arabia's
longtime public relations consultant Qorvis/MSL Group, among others,
orchestrated a campaign that reportedly duped U.S. military veterans
into lobbying against the 9/11 victims' families in exchange for a trip
to Washington, including a stay at the Trump International Hotel. This
was just the beginning of Saudi Arabia's courtship of the Trump
administration and the dramatic expansion of their influence operation
in Washington. Foreign Agent's Registration Act (FARA) records filed in
2017 show the Saudis spent nearly \$27 million on lobbying and public
relations firms, nearly triple their spending in 2016. Further analysis
of 2017 FARA filings shows that these firms contacted members of
Congress, the Trump administration, the media and various think tanks
more than 2,500 times. And they made nearly \$400,000 in campaign
contributions to representatives and senators they'd contacted on behalf
of their Saudi clients. Eleven of these contributions occurred on the
exact same day the member was contacted on behalf of Saudi Arabia. All
of this paid off immensely for the Saudis as the United States,
particularly Trump, either cheered or, at best, remained silent in a
series of alarming events in the past two years. Since 2015 Saudi Arabia
has been indiscriminately killing civilians with U.S. bombs in the war
in Yemen. Yet, just last month Secretary of State Mike Pompeo certified
that Saudi Arabia has been protecting civilians, and Trump has
repeatedly defended the sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia. Trump's first
trip abroad as president was to Saudi Arabia in May 2017, reportedly at
the suggestion of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who had become friends
with Mohammed bin Salman, King Salman's son. Within a month of the trip,
Saudi Arabia orchestrated a blockade of Qatar, home to the largest U.S.
military base in the Middle East, and Mohammed launched a literal palace
coupe to depose his cousin and become crown prince. Trump's reported
response: "We've put our man on top!" In November, MBS, as the crown
prince is known, then kidnapped, held hostage and tortured some of the
Saudi royals who had opposed his power grab, to which Trump tweeted he
had "great confidence" in the Saudi king and crown prince. But
Khashoggi's murder by the Saudis has changed the equation. [[For the
first time]{.mark} in the recent history of Saudi misdeeds, [there are
outcries from across the political spectrum]{.mark}. Some of the loudest
voices opposing the Saudis are congressional Republicans
who]{.underline}, along with many of their Democratic colleagues, [have
called for a host of punishments for the Saudis, including sanctions,
blocking arms sales and ending U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's war in
Yemen. **[One thing hasn't changed]{.mark}, however: [The Saudis still
have an army of lobbyists and public relations firms on their
payroll]{.mark}**. While some firms have dropped the Saudis as a client
since Khashoggi's disappearance, another, [Southwind Strategies]{.mark},
[recently signed a deal with the Saudis, and]{.mark} more than [two
dozen]{.mark} FARA-registered [firms continue to work for the kingdom.
They're]{.mark} likely [working tirelessly]{.mark} right now [to help
the Saudis come out of this unscathed]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} We
owe it to Jamal Khashoggi to not let them win. We owe it to him to
silence the Saudi lobby and punish Saudi Arabia for what they have done.

[[Under]{.mark}]{.underline} President Barack
[[Obama]{.underline}]{.mark}'s administration [[and]{.mark},
now]{.underline}, President Donald [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}'s, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has put its military might
behind the Saudi-led coalition,]{.underline} waging a war without
congressional authorization. That war has devastated Yemen's
infrastructure, destroyed or damaged more than half of Yemen's health
facilities, killed more than 8,350 civilians, injured another 9,500
civilians, displaced 3.3 million people, and created a humanitarian
disaster that threatens the lives of millions as cholera and famine
spread through the country. **[[U.S. arms]{.mark}
[merchants]{.mark}]{.underline}**, however, **[[have grown
rich]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Fragments of the bombs were documented by
journalists and HRW with help from Mastaba villagers. An HRW munitions
expert determined the bombs were 2,000-pound MK-84s, manufactured by
General Dynamics. Based in Falls Church, Va., General Dynamics is the
world's sixth most profitable arms manufacturer. One of the bombs used a
satellite guidance kit from Chicago-based Boeing, the world's
second-most profitable weapons company. The other bomb had a Paveway
guidance system, made by either Raytheon of Waltham, Mass., the
third-largest arms company in the world, or Lockheed Martin of Bethesda,
Md., the world's top weapons contractor. An In These Times analysis
found that in the past decade, the State Department has approved at
least \$30.1 billion in Saudi military contracts for these four
companies. The war in Yemen has been particularly lucrative for [General
Dynamics, Boeing and Raytheon]{.underline}, which [have received
hundreds of millions of dollars in Saudi weapons deals]{.underline}. All
three corporations have highlighted business with Saudi Arabia in their
reports to shareholders. Since the war began in March 2015, General
Dynamics' stock price has risen from about \$135 to \$169 per share,
Raytheon's from about \$108 to more than \$180, and Boeing's from about
\$150 to \$360. Lockheed Martin declined to comment for this story. A
spokesman for Boeing said the company follows "guidance from the United
States government," while Raytheon replied, "You will need to contact
the U.S. government." General Dynamics did not respond to inquiries. The
State Department declined to comment on the record. The **[weapons
contractors are]{.underline}** correct on one point: They're **[[working
hand-in-glove with the State Department]{.underline}]{.mark}**. By law,
the department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs must approve any
arms sales by U.S. companies to foreign governments. U.S. law also
prohibits sales to countries that indiscriminately kill civilians, as
the Saudi-led military coalition bombing Yemen did in the Mastaba strike
and many other documented cases. But **[[ending sales to Saudi Arabia
would cost the]{.mark} U.S. arms [industry its biggest global customer,
and to do so, Congress must cross an industry that pours millions into
the campaigns of lawmakers of both parties]{.mark}]{.underline}**. THE
CIVILIAN DEATH TOLL Saudi coalition spokesperson Gen. Ahmed al-Assiri
told the press that the Mastaba market bombing targeted a gathering of
Houthi fighters. But because the attack was indiscriminate, in that it
hit both civilians and a military target, and disproportionate, in that
the 97 civilian deaths would outweigh any expected military advantage,
HRW charged that the missile strikes violated international law.
According to an In These Times analysis of reports by HRW and the Yemeni
group Mwatana for Human Rights, the Saudi-led coalition (including the
United Arab Emirates \[UAE\], a Saudi ally that is also bombing Yemen)
has used U.S. weapons to kill at least 434 people and injure at least
1,004 in attacks that overwhelmingly include civilians and civilian
targets. "Most of the weapons that we have found and been able to
identify in strikes that appear unlawful have been U.S. weapons,"
Motaparthy says. "Factories have been hit. Farmlands have been hit with
cluster bombs. Not only have they killed civilians, but they have also
destroyed livelihoods and contributed to a dire humanitarian situation."
"The \[U.S. government is\] now on notice that there's a high likelihood
these weapons could be used in strikes that violate the laws of war,"
Motaparthy says. "They can no longer say the Saudis are targeting
accurately, that they have done their utmost to avoid civilian
casualties." According to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the United
States may not authorize arms exports to governments that consistently
engage in "gross violations of internationally recognized human rights."
The Arms Export Control Act of 1976 stipulates that exported weapons may
only be used for a country's defense. "When a country uses U.S.-origin
weapons for other than legitimate self-defense purposes, the
administration must suspend further sales, unless it issues a
certification to Congress that there's an overwhelming national security
need," says Brittany Benowitz, a former defense adviser for former Sen.
Russ Feingold (D-Wis.). "The Trump administration has not done that." A
HUNDRED-BILLION-DOLLAR CLIENT Over the past decade, Saudi Arabia has
ordered U.S.-made offensive weapons, surveillance equipment,
transportation, parts and training valued at \$109.3 billion, according
to an In These Times analysis of Pentagon announcements, contracts
announced on defense industry websites and arms transfers documented by
the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. That arsenal is
now being deployed against Yemen. Saudi Arabia's precision-guided
munitions are responsible for the vast majority of deaths documented by
human rights groups. In These Times found that, since 2009, Saudi Arabia
has ordered more than 27,000 missiles worth at least \$1.8 billion from
Raytheon alone, plus 6,000 guided bombs from Boeing (worth about \$332
million) and 1,300 cluster munitions from Rhode Island-based Textron
(worth about \$641 million). About \$650 million of those Raytheon
orders and an estimated \$103 million of the Boeing orders came after
the Saudi war in Yemen began. Without these ongoing American-origin
weapons transfers, the Saudi coalition's ability to prosecute its war
would wither. "We can stop providing munitions, and they could run out
of munitions, and then it would be impossible to keep the war going,"
says Jonathan Caverley, associate professor at the U.S. Naval War
College and a research scientist at M.I.T. The warplanes the United
States delivers also need steady upkeep. [Since the war began, the
Saudis have struck deals worth \$5.5 billion with war contractors for
weapons maintenance, support and training]{.underline}. "The Saudi
military has a very sophisticated, high-tech, capital-intensive military
that requires almost constant customer service," Caverley says. "And so
most of the planes would be grounded if Lockheed Martin or Boeing turn
off the help line." "JUST A PILIING UP OF STUFF" The U.S.-Saudi
relationship has its roots in the 1938 discovery of oil in Saudi Arabia,
and President Franklin Roosevelt's energy-for-security deal with the
Saudi monarchy. Today, in addition to oil, U.S.-Saudi relations are
cemented by a geopolitical alliance against Iran---and by weapons deals.
Arms exports accelerated under Obama. By 2016, his administration had
offered to sell \$115 billion in weapons and defensive equipment to
Saudi Arabia---the most of any administration in history. Those arms
exports "used to be more of a symbolic thing, just piling up the stuff,"
says William Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the
Center for International Policy. But experts also say selling the Saudis
so many arms incentivized the Arab monarchy to use them in devastating
fashion. "If a country, like Saudi Arabia or the UAE, has no commitment
to human rights---whether stated or in practice---it's no wonder that
those countries would eventually misuse U.S.-sold weapons by committing
war crimes," says Kate Kizer, the policy director of Win Without War.
"The U.S. government should be assuming these weapons of warfare will
eventually be used in a conflict, even if one isn't going on at the
moment." With the Saudi invasion of Yemen in 2015, the U.S.-Saudi arms
pipeline became deadly. [Despite reports that U.S. bombs were killing
civilians, the Obama administration's support for the Saudi war drew
only muted criticism in Washington]{.underline}. "It was Obama's war,
and there was a lot of reluctance in Congress to take this on,
particularly among Democrats," says Shireen Al-Adeimi, a Yemeni American
activist and professor at Michigan State University. Still, advocates
with groups like Win Without War, Just Foreign Policy and the Yemen
Peace Project worked to raise public awareness of the war's horrors,
lobbying Congress and the White House. In May 2016, Obama canceled the
delivery of 400 Textron cluster bombs to Saudi Arabia. In December 2016,
two months after a Saudi airstrike hit a funeral hall and killed more
than 100 people in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, he halted the sale of
16,000 precision guided bombs from Raytheon, a deal worth \$350 million.
Those two decisions accounted for only a fraction of overall arms sales
to the Saudis, and the flow of most weapons continued unchecked. TRUMP'S
BIG PHOTO OPP When Trump took office in January 2017, he made it a
priority to strengthen the U.S.-Saudi relationship, which had taken a
hit after Obama's nuclear deal with Iran. As part of that bid, Trump
reversed Obama's decision to halt the \$350 million Raytheon order.
Trump's first overseas visit, in May 2017, was to Saudi Arabia, a jaunt
to strengthen the alliance against Iran and get Saudi Arabia to sign on
to Trump's plans for an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. During that
visit, the United States agreed to sell Saudi Arabia \$110 billion
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} American weapons, with an option for a total
of \$350 billion over the next decade. Trump boasted his deals would
bring 500,000 jobs to the United States, but his own State Department
put the figure at tens of thousands. On May 20, [[2017,]{.mark}
Trump]{.underline} and King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud [presided over
Boeing's and Raytheon's signings of M]{.underline}emorandums
[o]{.underline}f [A]{.underline}greement [with Saudi Arabia for future
business]{.underline}. Raytheon used the opportunity to open a new
division, Raytheon Saudi Arabia. "This strategic partnership is the next
step in our over 50-year relationship in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"
Raytheon CEO Thomas A. Kennedy told shareholders. "Together, we can help
build world-class defense and cyber capabilities." [The ink was barely
dry before \$500 million of the deal was threatened by [a bill]{.mark},
introduced by]{.underline} Sen. Rand [Paul]{.underline} (R-Ky.) in May
2017, [[to block the sale of bombs to Saudi Arabia. In response, Boeing
and Raytheon hired lobbying firms to make their case]{.underline}. [In
the end, five Democrats]{.underline}]{.mark}---Joe
[Donnelly]{.underline} (Ind.), Claire [McCaskill]{.underline} (Mo.), Joe
[Manchin]{.underline} (W.Va.), Bill [Nelson]{.underline} (Fla.)
[and]{.underline} Mark [Warner]{.underline} (Va.)---[[broke with their
party to ensure arms sales continued]{.underline}]{.mark}, in a 53-47
vote. [[The five had collectively received tens of thousands in arms
industry donations]{.underline},]{.mark} and would receive another
\$148,032 in the next election cycle from the PACs and employees of
Boeing and Raytheon. Nelson and McCaskill pulled in \$44,308 and
\$57,230, respectively[. Weapons firms are aided by a revolving door
with the Trump administration]{.underline}. Then-Defense Secretary Jim
Mattis, a former General Dynamics board member, warned Sen. Lindsey
Graham (R-S.C.) that the Rand Paul bill would be a boon for Iran. Acting
Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan served as a senior vice president of
Boeing prior to coming to the Defense Department, though it's unclear
whether he's championed U.S.-Saudi arms deals. The Wall Street Journal
reports that, in 2018, State Department staff, voicing concerns about
the war on Yemen, asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo not to certify
that civilian deaths were being reduced. Their concerns were overridden
by the department's Bureau of Legislative Affairs, which argued such a
move could put billions of dollars in future arms sales in jeopardy. The
bureau is led by Charles Faulkner, a former Raytheon lobbyist. CONGRESS
WAKES UP In October 2018, the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia took
center stage in Washington, when Saudi agents murdered and dismembered
journalist Jamal Khashoggi in their country's consulate in Istanbul.
Khashoggi, a Saudi Washington Post columnist, had been critical of Saudi
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The murder forced Congress to reckon
with Salman, who, as defense minister, had launched the Saudi war on
Yemen alongside a vicious crackdown on human rights activists. Suddenly,
leading members of Congress, including Graham and other defenders of the
U.S.-Saudi relationship, were alarmed at the prospect of selling more
arms to Salman. "The Khashoggi murder really broke the dam on
congressional outrage about what the administration's conduct has been
\[toward Saudi Arabia\]," says Kate Gould, former legislative director
for Middle East policy at the Friends Committee on National Legislation.
This spring, the Senate and House passed a bill championed by Sen.
Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) requiring the
United States to stop giving the Saudi coalition intelligence and to
prohibit the in-air refueling of Saudi warplanes. It was the first time
in U.S. history that both chambers of Congress invoked the War Powers
Act, designed to check the president's war-making powers by requiring
congressional authorization to deploy troops overseas. Trump vetoed the
bill on April 16. Arms expert William Hartung says the current political
climate makes new deals unlikely: "It'd be very difficult \[right now\]
to push a substantial sale of offensive weapons like bombs. Anything
that can be used in the war is probably a non-starter." Still, billions
of dollars of approved weapons are already in the pipeline. If
congressional anger at the Saudis wanes, the arms spigot could reopen.
[In February, a bipartisan group of senators]{.underline}---including
Graham and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.)---[introduced]{.underline} the Saudi
Arabia Accountability [an]{.underline}d Yemen [Act]{.underline} of 2019,
[which would halt future sales]{.underline} of ammunition, tanks,
warplanes and bombs, and suspend exports of bombs that had been given a
prior green light. Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) wants to go even further.
In January, he introduced legislation that would ban all weapons exports
to Saudi Arabia, as well as maintenance and logistical support. The bill
has 29 cosponsors (most of them Democrats). "The bottom line is: We know
for a fact that they're bombing school buses, bombing weddings, bombing
funerals, and innocent people are being murdered," McGovern told In
These Times. "The question now is: Are we going to just issue a press
release and say, 'We're horrified,' or is there going to be a
consequence?" McGovern says that if a measure like his is not passed,
"other authoritarian regimes around the world will say, 'Hey, we can do
whatever the hell we want.'" **[[To pass such bills, Congress members
will have to muscle past the arms industry.]{.underline}]{.mark}** In
Lockheed Martin's 2018 annual report, the company warned, "Discussions
in Congress may result in sanctions on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia." For
Jehan Hakim of the Yemeni Alliance Committee, [[the ongoing war comes
down to the influence of money in Washington]{.underline}]{.mark}. "We
talk to family back home \[in Yemen\] and the question they ask is,
'Why? Why is the U.S. supporting the Saudi coalition?'" Hakim says.
"Profiteering is put before the lives of humans."

#### **The link is massive and exponentially increasing---Saudis and defense contractors hire the same lobbying firms to maximize influence**

**Hashem & Allen 19** (Mashal and James, research associates with the
Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative at the Center for
International Policy, *The Nation*, "How Lobbying Firms Helped Destroy
Yemen," published May 16^th^, 2019,

accessed 7/3/19, JME.)

A springtime wedding in Northern Yemen's Al-Raqah village took place in
April 2018, a moment of reprieve from the turmoil and devastation of
that war-torn country, a moment to celebrate life, love, and the birth
of a new family. From the tents constructed for the event, music flooded
into the village and, as at any good wedding, exuberant dancing was a
central part of the festivities. Unbeknownst to the guests, the music
masked the buzzing of a warplane overhead. Suddenly, in a horrific turn
of events, [Saudi-led forces launched a deadly air strike and
20-year-old groom Yahya Ja'afar's wedding was transformed into a scene
of carnage.]{.underline} Deafened by the explosion, guests fearfully
searched for loved ones in a sea of confusion and body parts. In a
telling photo, the flowery wreaths worn by celebrants lie atop a
landscape of rubble. At least 20 wedding-goers lost their lives to the
Saudi-led coalition's now four-year-old brutal campaign in that country.
Shortly thereafter, media reports identified the bomb as
American-made---a GBU-12 Paveway II linked to Raytheon, one of the
Pentagon's largest defense contractors. [Tragedies like
this,]{.underline} however[, didn't stop]{.underline} President [Trump
from exercising his veto power on April 16 to reject a resolution passed
by Congress to end American involvement in the Yemeni conflict. Nor did
they sway most Republicans in Congress to use their override power to
kill the veto on May 2. After all, for many of Washington's actors,
**such tragedies**, while devastating, **are part of a remarkably
lucrative business model**.]{.underline} Obviously[, this is the
case]{.underline} for the American defense companies that have been
supplying weapons and equipment of all sorts to Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) in their ongoing war. But it's no less so
[for the little-publicized lobbying groups that represent
them]{.underline}. In 2018, [more than a dozen such firms were working
on behalf of the Saudis or the Emiratis, while also providing their
services to defense contractors whose weapons are being used in the
conflict.]{.underline} [Two prominent examples of lobbying firms with
significant stakes in the Yemen War are the McKeon Group and American
Defense International (ADI]{.underline}). Both firms have cleverly
managed to represent both the most powerful US arms manufacturers and
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. [**This lobbying model**,
which **allows them to satisfy** multiple clients at the same
time---**contractors eager to secure arms deals and foreign powers**
that depend on American political and military support---has played a
significant role in keeping the United States rooted in the Yemen
conflict.]{.underline} A LOBBYING MODEL FOR PROFITING FROM YEMEN Yahya
Ja'afar's wedding illustrates a disturbing pattern. Reports indicate
that, at the sites of many Saudi-UAE coalition air strikes in Yemen,
evidence of munitions produced by the big four American defense
contractors---Lockheed Martin, Boeing, General Dynamics, and
Raytheon---can be found. These four companies represent the largest
suppliers of weapons to the Saudi and UAE coalition and have spent
millions of dollars on lobbying efforts to retain political support in
Washington. [**Their arsenal of lobbyists works tenaciously on the
Hill**, securing meetings with top officials on key congressional
committees to advocate and push for increased arms sales.]{.underline}
[In 2018]{.underline}, according to the Lobbying Disclosure Act website,
which provides information on such firms and their domestic clients,
[Boeing spent \$15 million on lobbyists, Lockheed Martin \$13.2 million,
General Dynamics \$11.9 million, and Raytheon \$4.4
million.]{.underline} While this may seem like an exorbitant amount of
money, [such expenses have yielded an extraordinary return on investment
via arms sales to the Saudis and Emiratis]{.underline}. A report
published by the Center for International Policy last year documented
that such companies and others like them sold \$4.5 billion worth of
weapons to Saudi Arabia and \$1.2 billion to the United Arab Emirates in
2018 alone. [And at the heart of this web of money are firms like ADI
and the McKeon Group that make their profits off both the weapons makers
and the war makers.]{.underline} Led by former Republican congressman
and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee Howard "Buck" McKeon,
the McKeon Group has double-dipped in this "forgotten war" for three
years now. After all, the firm represents many of the top sellers of
arms and munitions, including Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Orbital
ATK, MBDA, and L3 Technologies, as well as Saudi Arabia. In other words,
[the McKeon Group lobbies Washington's political machine for both the
sellers and the buyer.]{.underline} From his earliest days in the House,
Buck McKeon has had ties to the US defense industry. His trajectory into
and out of Congress offers, in fact[, a perfect example of what
Washington's military-industrial "**revolving door"** looks
like]{.underline}. From 1991 to 2014, years when he held California's
25th Congressional district seat, McKeon received campaign contributions
totaling \$192,900 from Lockheed Martin and \$190,200 from Northrop
Grumman. Those two companies were then his top campaign contributors and
are now his current clients. In return, he advanced their interests
inside Congress, especially as the powerful chairman of the Armed
Services Committee, and now does the same from the outside as a major
lobbyist. His firm receives an annual retainer of \$190,000 from
Lockheed Martin and \$110,000 from Northrop Grumman for its efforts on
the Hill. In 2018 alone, in fact, the firm took in a whopping
\$1,697,000 from 10 of the largest defense contractors to, among other
objectives, continue the flow of arms to Saudi Arabia. At the same time,
McKeon and his firm also work directly for Saudi Arabia, which just
happens to be one of the biggest foreign buyers of Lockheed Martin and
Northrop Grumman weaponry. The records of the Foreign Agents
Registration Act (FARA) reveal that, last year, the McKeon Group was
paid \$920,148.21 by the Kingdom and engaged in aggressive political
lobbying in Congress against bills that would have adversely affected
the US arms trade with the Saudis. Above all, there was S.J. Res. 54,
the Yemen resolution jointly sponsored by Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT)
and Senator Mike Lee (R-UT), meant to end American involvement in that
war. FARA filings indicate that the firm made numerous phone calls and
sent multiple emails to members of the Senate and House as key votes
approached. Most notably, on November 14, 2018, exactly two weeks before
a vote on the resolution was to take place, the McKeon Group contacted
Oklahoma Republican Senator Jim Inhofe, the current chairman of the
Armed Services Committee, on behalf of the Saudis. Inhofe's
congressional office was called in "regards to the KSA \[Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia\]" and again on November 29, the day after the vote,
"regarding S.J. Res. 54." On the 14th, the firm also gave a \$1,000
donation to the Senator. Ultimately, Inhofe voted in favor of continuing
military support for the Saudis, undeterred by the thousands of civilian
deaths the war has caused. When the McKeon Group succeeds in advancing
the agenda of the Saudis and the giant weapons makers in Washington, it
proves its value and receives significant compensation. [And nothing,
including the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal
Khashoggi]{.underline} in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul or continued
reports on the country's brutal war and blockade in Yemen, which has
left significant numbers of Yemenis dead of, or at the edge of,
starvation, [has stopped Buck McKeon and his firm from continuing to
ramp up their lobbying activities.]{.underline} As for American Defense
International, it has similarly double-dipped in the Yemen war. It, too,
represents an impressive list of defense contractors, including
Raytheon, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, L3 Technologies, and
General Atomics---and also the United Arab Emirates, the Saudi-war
coalition member that often slides under the media radar. At a moment
filled with harrowing reports of death, starvation, and devastation in
Yemen, ADI's lobbyists spent their days aggressively advancing the
interests of their Emirati and defense contractor clients. For instance,
FARA reports reveal that, in September 2018, ADI called the office of
New Mexico Democratic Senator Martin Heinrich, a member of the Armed
Services Committee, on behalf of the UAE embassy in Washington. The
discussion, according to FARA, focused on the "situation in Yemen" and
the "Paveway sale to the UAE"---in other words, on the sale of the very
kind of Raytheon bomb that turned Yahya Ja'afar's wedding into the scene
of a deadly air strike. FARA filings also indicate, for example, that
during the same month, ADI met with the policy adviser for Louisiana
Republican Congressman Steve Scalise to lobby against the congressional
resolution on Yemen. For these and similar efforts, the UAE continued to
pump \$45,000 a month into ADI. At the same time, such lobbying efforts
clearly benefited another client of the firm: Raytheon. The manufacturer
of Paveway bombs paid ADI \$120,000 in 2018. [For firms like American
Defense International and the McKeon Group, war is a matter of profits
and clients and little else.]{.underline}

#### **Iranophobia means the plan costs PC -- maintaining the military alliance outweighs human rights concerns**

**Friedman & Bayoumy 7/1** (Uri, staff writer covering national security
and global affairs, and Yara, senior editor, *The Atlantic,* "The
U.S.-Saudi Alliance Is on the Brink," published July 1^st^, 2019,

[**The GOP rebellion is real, if limited**. Lindsey Graham, one of
Trump's top allies in the Senate]{.underline}, hasn't supported all
anti-Saudi efforts in Congress, [but he has nevertheless been extremely
critical of MbS. Graham and other Republicans, such as Senator Todd
Young of Indiana, have backed a sweeping bill that would mandate
sanctions on any Saudi official found responsible for Khashoggi's murder
and seek to restrain Saudi Arabia in Yemen**. Most Republicans, however,
are sticking with the kingdom as a bulwark against Iran.**
Occasionally]{.underline}, however, [the administration has succumbed to
pressure from Congress. Last year it halted U.S. refueling of
Saudi-coalition aircraft involved in the Yemen conflict.]{.underline}
And, as Murphy pointed out to us, [earlier this year Trump quietly
signed a budget bill that prohibits assistance to Saudi Arabia through a
military-training program]{.underline}. That assistance had qualified
the Saudis for discounts on purchases of additional U.S. military
training. "There are limits to what Congress can do when it comes to
rightsizing a bilateral relationship," especially when only "a handful
of Republicans" are willing to vote with Democrats, Murphy said. "We can
set boundaries. But we can't do day-to-day management." [These limits,
though, might disappear if a Democrat succeeds Trump in the White
House]{.underline}. Saudi officials look at the chorus of criticism from
American politicians and complain that the kingdom "is guilty by
association in Washington because of having cultivated a close
relationship with Donald Trump," and that it has become a "political
football" between the president and his opponents, Maksad notes. Duss,
the Sanders adviser, acknowledges that the Democrat-led push to rein in
the Saudis isn't just a policy dispute. "Trump, just by being Trump, has
created a political incentive for questioning the relationship," he
says. "But it's an opening to have a really important and long-overdue
discussion. We started to have it after 9/11, then it kind of went
nowhere." Trump's approach is to "align with this growing Saudi,
Emirati, Israeli, anti-Iran conception of the region, and \[Sanders\] is
very much of a different view," Duss said, speaking with us in March
before the spike in hostilities with Iran. "We have serious problems
with a lot of what Iran is doing in the region, what they are doing with
their own population, but the idea that we're going to achieve our own
goals or stability in the region through conflict with Iran is bonkers."
That conflict almost erupted last month, after Iran shot down a U.S.
drone, but was averted---for now---when Trump called off planned strikes
on Iranian targets. "The narrative that Obama was abandoning Saudi
Arabia was kind of bullshit to begin with." The president's loyalty to
Riyadh seems to stem in part from his desire to reverse the foreign
policy of Obama, who was criticized for trying to reconcile with Iran at
the expense of Saudi Arabia. Obama negotiated a nuclear deal with Iran
and was deeply ambivalent about the alliance with Saudi Arabia, but he
avoided upending the partnership---suggesting that he wouldn't have
broken off relations with the Saudis were he still president under
today's circumstances. "The narrative that Obama was abandoning Saudi
Arabia was kind of bullshit to begin with," Murphy observed. "He sold
them more weapons than anybody else sold them, and he was willing to
support this war in Yemen." "I think it's really dangerous to be in
business with Mohammed bin Salman. I think he's a reckless,
destabilizing force in the Middle East," Murphy said, using language
that Trump's camp often applies to Iran. "Saudi Arabia will remain an
ally," he predicted, in regard to what policy toward the kingdom could
look like in a Democratic administration. But "we will be more careful
in the nature of the military relationship and less willing to follow
them into battle," he added, advocating scaled-back arms sales that
exclude offensive weapons. Asked to respond to lawmakers who say they no
longer want to work with MbS, the senior Saudi official said, "Our
leadership is a red line, with all due respect to U.S. lawmakers, but
the succession in the kingdom is strictly a domestic affair." The
official added that "it is unimaginable to go in a different direction"
now that King Salman has appointed the crown prince as his successor.
Democrats and other American critics of MbS need to acknowledge that the
33-year-old crown prince is firmly entrenched in power and will be the
one dealing with any future U.S. president, Maksad argues. But the
Saudis, for their part, have not launched "a concerted, thought-out
strategic effort" to reach out to these detractors, particularly since
the aftermath of the Khashoggi killing left the Saudi embassy in D.C.
without an ambassador. (The new ambassador, Princess Reema bint Bandar,
is set to start her post soon.) There is some concern among Saudi
watchers that the kingdom has staked too much on its personal
relationship with Trump and that U.S. support for the alliance could
crater if he's not reelected, Maksad says. [But the Saudis are reassured
by the notion that as a behemoth in the oil markets, a strategic ally in
the struggle against Iran, and an arbiter in the war of ideas in the
Muslim world, Saudi Arabia is too powerful a player to be overlooked, no
matter who is in power in the United States. "Ultimately, the
relationship is too important (for the world) to fail,"]{.underline} the
senior Saudi official wrote to us. Asked what it would take for MbS and
other Saudi leaders to be received more favorably in Washington, Murphy
said they would need to act as the "instigator" for a peace agreement in
Yemen rather than a "roadblock" and curb repression of political
dissidents. "Presidents come and go, but nations that have stable
relationships and strong relationships with the United States" need to
retain support in Congress, Khanna argues, citing U.S. alliances with
Britain, France, India, and Israel as examples: "Why I would be so
concerned if I were the Saudis is they've lost that foundational
support."

[President [Trump wants to use]{.mark} his [emergency powers to sell
billions]{.mark} of dollars' [worth of weapons to Saudi]{.mark}
[Arabia]{.mark} on national security grounds]{.underline}. Congress
wants to stop the sale because of lingering anger over Saudi abuses and
the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and the usurpation of its
legal authority to review arms sales. Both sides are ingenuous. [[The
willingness]{.mark} to sell the Saudis weapons [has]{.mark} little to do
with American national security, and everything [to do with economics
and politics.]{.mark}]{.underline} Congress has looked the other way for
decades as administrations of both parties have sold some of our most
sophisticated weapons to the Saudis. President Obama sold the Saudis
\$112 billion in weapons over eight years, including a record \$60
billion package in 2010, and reportedly was prepared to sell another
\$115 billion in 2016. Both branches of government understand the
Faustian bargain America made long ago with the kingdom. The Saudis sell
us oil, and we help guarantee the survival of the monarchy. By
moderating the price of oil, the Saudis help the American economy, which
benefits the president. [[Selling arms gives the regime a sense of
security, while]{.mark} allowing us to get money we spend on oil back,
**benefiting US defense contractors, and [creating jobs in states where
a president needs to collect electoral votes]{.mark}.**]{.underline} In
1981, a majority of the Senate initially disapproved of the sale of
AWACS radar planes to the Saudis, partly because of the potential threat
they posed to Israel. The Reagan administration preposterously argued
the planes couldn't endanger Israel, but would allow the Saudis to
defend themselves from the Soviet Union. Adding to the absurdity, the
Saudi defense minister threatened to turn to the Soviets if the US
didn't sell them the planes. More important was the fact that more than
700 corporations in 42 states had contracts with Saudi Arabia. Each of
these, in turn, had hundreds of subcontractors, all of whom shared the
principals' interest in keeping the Saudis happy. The presidents of
Boeing, the main contractor for the AWACS, and United Technologies,
which had \$100 million at stake, sent out more than 6,500 telegrams to
subsidiaries, vendors, and suppliers all over the country urging them to
lobby for the sale. The president of the US Chamber of Commerce wrote to
every senator the day before the AWACS vote, and 860,000 recipients of
the Chamber's newsletter were advised of the adverse consequences for US
trade if the sale were not approved. The AWACS sale went through after
Reagan twisted enough Republican arms to reverse what seemed a certain
defeat. How did the Saudis show their gratitude? OPEC raised the price
of oil, and the Saudis announced a production cutback. The kingdom also
denounced Oman for participating in a US military exercise and offered
money to the emirate if it canceled an agreement allowing America access
to its military facilities. The Saudis subsequently opposed US policy
towards Israel, Lebanon, Egypt, the PLO, Syria, and Libya. Bill Clinton
shared Reagan's economic and political motivation when he convinced the
Saudis to sign a \$7 billion deal for commercial aircraft. Clinton
subsequently took credit for creating an estimated 100,000 jobs. The
states benefiting from the deal were worth 122 electoral votes in the
forthcoming election. Fast forward to today when, after the sale of more
than \$100 billion in US arms, the Saudis are unable to defeat an army
of Iranian-backed Houthi tribesmen, who have much fewer financial
resources. And their failure has been accompanied by the deaths of
thousands of Yemeni civilians in attacks using American weapons. This
carnage provoked Congress to vote to end US support for the Saudi war in
Yemen. Congress will fail, however, to prevent the proposed arms sale.
Anger about Yemen, the lack of Saudi transparency regarding the
Khashoggi murder, perpetual human rights abuses in the kingdom, and
Trump's effort to bypass Congressional review created a confluence of
forces to block the sale. Nevertheless, [**[only seven
Republicans]{.mark} in the Senate [voted to disapprove]{.mark} the sale,
[far short of the veto-proof majority needed.]{.mark}** Hence, Trump can
supplement the \$510 million sale of precision-guided munitions to Saudi
Arabia that he authorized in 2017.]{.underline} Supporting a country
that undermines our values and interests has always been questionable.
Up until now, however, Saudi behavior has never provoked such widespread
opposition. Whether it can be sustained in the present case or beyond is
unclear, but history is not reassuring given the economic and political
interests of presidents of both parties.

Here's a cheery note for you: the last mass killing of 2017 took place
moments before midnight on New Year's Eve. A 16-year-old New Jersey boy
picked up a semi-automatic rifle, "lawfully acquired" by a member of his
family, and killed his father, mother, sister, and a family friend. In
doing so, he helped ensure that 2017 would be the deadliest year for
mass killings in our modern history. ([[There is]{.mark} now, on
average, [slightly more than one mass killing a day in this
country]{.mark}]{.underline}.) Nonetheless, guns of all sorts, including
military-style assault rifles and even bump stocks like the 12 Stephen
Paddock evidently used to turn his semi-automatics into functional
automatics and slaughter 58 people from a hotel window in Las Vegas, are
still readily available. Nowhere on Earth, not even in ravaged Yemen
(which takes second place in gun ownership), is more weaponry available
to more types of people. As the years go by here, such weapons are more
easily and openly carried with only the most minimal of background
checks (or less than that). Think about this: Americans, 4.4% of the
people on this planet, own 42% of the guns and commit 31% of the mass
killings. Oh, and I did promise you that there was something cheery in
all this, didn't I? So here it is: the [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}
administration, knowing a good thing when it sees it,
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[hard at work ensuring]{.mark} that
[American weapons makers]{.mark} will [make it a remarkably similar
world]{.mark}]{.underline}. Its officials are intent, it seems, on
recreating the planet in an American image. Keep in mind that U.S. arms
makers like Lockheed, Raytheon, and General Dynamics already monopolize
the global arms market in a way that should (but in this country
regularly doesn't) stagger the imagination. U.S. weapons sales in 2016,
for instance, took about 50% of global market share and many of those
major weapons systems went into planetary hot spots, including Yemen
(thanks to the American-backed Saudi war of annihilation there).
Weaponry from other countries, year after year in this century, came in
a distant second, third, or fourth. Between 2012 and 2016, in fact, the
U.S. sold weaponry to at least 100 countries. So Washington is already,
in significant ways, arming the world, but evidently, as far as
President Trump and the weapons makers he loves are concerned, not yet
enough of it. As a result, [his administration is reportedly [planning
to open the global spigot on the very sorts of weapons]{.mark} now
[regularly used]{.mark} in this country [for mass killings, making it
far easier for American gun and ammunition manufacturers to sell]{.mark}
to anyone interested [abroad and]{.mark} far [harder for law
enforcement]{.mark} here [to track]{.mark} whose hands those weapons end
up in. Administration officials supposedly plan to cut down on oversight
for such sales [by making]{.mark} the [Commerce]{.mark} Department,
[not]{.mark} the [State]{.mark} Department, [responsible for them, while
streamlining small arms export controls]{.mark}]{.underline}, a process
the Obama administration began. At news of this, the (non-bump) stocks
of gun manufacturers surged. Think of this in Trumpian terms as the
global deregulation of American firearms which could, in turn, according
to critics, put such weaponry ever more easily in the hands of both
criminal gangs and extremist groups. If this happens, we'll truly be in
an open carry, NRA world, and Donald Trump will have fulfilled a
campaign promise made at that organization\'s annual meeting last year.
("You came through for me and I am going to come through for you.") From
nuclear weapons to handguns, "arms control" increasingly seems like a
concept from another century. There are nonetheless voices still
speaking up against the wholesale American weaponization of the planet
and one of the most knowledgeable is that of TomDispatch regular William
Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for
International Policy. So let him fill you in on what the coming boom
years are likely to look like for the Pentagon, the arms makers, and
their weaponry. Tom [As Donald [Trump]{.mark} might put it, major
weapons contractors like Boeing, Raytheon, and Lockheed Martin cashed in
"bigly" in his first year in office. They raked in tens of billions of
dollars in Pentagon contracts, while posting sharp stock price increases
and healthy profits driven by the continuation and expansion of
Washington's post-9/11 wars. But [last year's bonanza is likely to be no
more than a down payment on even better days to come for the
military-industrial complex]{.mark}.]{.underline} President Trump moved
boldly in his first budget, seeking an additional \$54 billion in
Pentagon funding for fiscal year 2018. That figure, by the way, equals
the entire military budgets of allies like Germany, France, the United
Kingdom, and Japan. Then, in a bipartisan stampede, Congress egged on
Trump to go even higher, putting forward a defense authorization bill
that would raise the Pentagon's budget by an astonishing \$85 billion.
(And don't forget that, last spring, the president and Congress had
already tacked an extra \$15 billion onto the 2017 Pentagon budget.) The
authorization bill for 2018 is essentially just a suggestion, however
\-- the final figure for this year will be determined later this month,
if Congress can come to an agreement on how to boost the caps on
domestic and defense spending imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011.
The final number is likely to go far higher than the staggering figure
Trump requested last spring. And that's only the beginning of the good
news for the big weapons companies. Industry officials and Beltway
defense analysts aren't expecting the real increase in Pentagon spending
to come until the 2019 budget. [It's a subject sure to make it into the
mid-term elections. [Dangling]{.mark} potential [infusions of Pentagon
funds in swing states and swing districts is a tried and true way to
influence voters]{.mark} in tight races and so will tempt candidates in
both parties.]{.underline} President [[Trump has long emphasized job
creation above much else]{.underline}]{.mark}, but if he has an actual
jobs program, it mainly seems to involve pumping more money into the
Pentagon and increasing overseas arms sales. That such spending is one
of the least effective ways to create new jobs evidently matters little.
[[It is, after all, an easy and popular way for a president to give
himself the look of stimulating economic activity]{.underline}]{.mark},
especially in an era of steep tax cuts favoring the plutocratic class
and attacks on domestic spending. Trump's much-touted \$1 trillion
infrastructure plan may never materialize, but the Pentagon is already
on course to spend \$6 trillion to \$7 trillion of your taxes over the
next decade. As it happens though, a surprising percentage of those
dollars won't even go into the military equivalent of infrastructure.
Based on what we know of Pentagon expenditures in 2016, up to half of
such funds are likely to go directly into the coffers of defense
contractors rather than to the troops or to basic military tasks like
training and maintenance. While the full impact of
**[Trump's]{.underline}** proposed Pentagon spending increases won't be
felt until later this year and in 2019, he did make a significant impact
last year in his role as **[arms-dealer-in-chief]{.underline}**. Early
estimates for 2017 suggest that arms sales approvals in the first year
of his administration exceeded the Obama administration's record in its
last year in office \-- no mean feat given that President Obama set a
record for overseas arms deals during his eight-year tenure. You
undoubtedly won't be surprised to learn that President Trump greatly
exaggerated the size of his administration's arms deals. Typically
enough, he touted "\$110 billion" in proposed sales to Saudi Arabia, a
figure that included deals already struck under Obama and highly
speculative offers that may never come to fruition. While visiting Japan
in November, he similarly took credit for sales of the staggeringly
expensive, highly overrated F-35 combat aircraft, a deal that was
actually concluded in 2012. To add insult to injury, those F-35s that
the U.S. is selling Japan will be assembled there, not in the good old
U.S.A. (So much for the jobs benefits of global weapons trading.)
Nonetheless, when you peel away the layers of Trumpian bombast and
exaggeration, his administration still posted one of the highest arms
sales figures of the last decade and there's clearly much more to come.
In all of this, the president may not have done major favors for
America's workers, but he's been a genuine godsend for the country's
arms manufacturers. After all, such firms extract significantly greater
profits on foreign deals than on sales to the Pentagon. When selling to
other countries, they normally charge higher prices for weapons systems,
while including costly follow-on agreements for maintenance, training,
and things like additional bombs, missiles, or ammunition that can
continue for decades. In fact, Trump's biggest challenge in accelerating
U.S. arms exports may not be foreign competition, but the fact that the
Obama administration made so many high-value arms deals. Some countries
are still busy trying to integrate the weapons systems or other
merchandise they've already purchased and may not be ready to conclude
new arms agreements. The Good News for Arms Makers: More War [There
are]{.underline}, however, [a number of reasons to think that the major
weapons makers will do even better in the coming years]{.underline} than
they did in the banner year of 2017. Start with America's wars. As
defense expert Micah Zenko of Chatham House explained recently at
Foreign Policy, President Trump has been doubling down on many of the
wars he inherited from Obama. The moves of his administration (peopled,
of course, by generals from those very wars) include the increasing use
of Special Operations forces, a dramatic rise in air strikes, and an
increase in troop levels in conflicts ranging from Afghanistan and Yemen
to Syria and Somalia. It remains to be seen whether the president's
favorite Middle Eastern ally, Saudi Arabia, will be successful in
goading his administration \-- replete with Iranophobes, including
Secretary of Defense James Mattis and CIA Director Mike Pompeo \-- into
taking military action against Tehran. Such calculations have been
complicated by recent anti-government protests there, which the
president and his inner circle hope will lead to regime change from
within. (Trump's crowing about unrest in Iran has, however, been
decidedly unhelpful to genuine advocates of democracy in that country,
given the low esteem in which he's held throughout Iranian society.)
Such far-flung military operations will naturally cost money. Lots of
it. Minimally, tens of billions of dollars; hundreds of billions if one
or more of those wars escalates in an unexpected way \-- as happened in
Afghanistan and Iraq in the Bush years. As a study by the Costs of War
Project at Brown University's Watson Institute recently noted, our
post-9/11 wars have already cost at least \$5.6 trillion when one takes
into account both direct budgetary commitments and long-term
obligations, including lifetime care for the hundreds of thousands of
American veterans who suffered severe physical and psychological damage
in those conflicts. It's important to remember that such immense costs
emerged from what was supposed to be a quick, triumphant war in
Afghanistan and what top Bush administration officials were convinced
would be a relatively inexpensive regime change operation in Iraq and
the garrisoning of that country. (That invasion and occupation was then
projected to cost just a cut-rate \$50 billion to \$200 billion.) Don't
be surprised if the conflicts that Trump has inherited and is now
escalating follow a similar pattern in which actual costs far outstrip
initial estimates, even if not at the stratospheric levels of the Afghan
and Iraq wars, which involved the commitment of hundreds of thousands of
"boots on the ground." All of this spending will again be good financial
news for the producers of combat aircraft, munitions, armored vehicles,
drones, and attack helicopters, among other goods and services needed to
sustain a policy of endless war across significant parts of the planet.
Beyond the hot wars that have involved U.S. troops and air strikes in
Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen, there are
scores of other places where this country's Special Operations forces
are on the ground training local militaries and in many cases
accompanying them on missions that could quickly turn deadly, as
happened to four Green Berets operating in Niger in October 2017. With
Special Ops personnel engaged in a staggering 149 countries last year
and a pledge to step up U.S. activities yet more in Africa \-- there are
already 6,000 U.S. troops and scores of "train and equip" missions on
that continent \-- spending is essentially guaranteed to go up, whatever
the specifics of any given conflict. There are already calls by leading
members of Congress to increase the size of U.S. Special Operations
forces, which, as TomDispatch's Nick Turse notes, already number nearly
70,000 personnel. Boondoggles, Inc. Rest assured, however, that so far
we've only taken a dip in the shallow end of the deep, deep pool of
military spending. Equally important to the bottom lines of Lockheed
Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, General Dynamics, and their
cohorts is the Trump administration's commitment to continue funding
weapons systems the Pentagon doesn't need at prices we can't afford.
Take the F-35 combat plane, a Rube Goldberg contraption once designed to
carry out multiple missions and now capable of doing none of them well.
In fact, as the Project on Government Oversight has pointed out, it's an
aircraft that may never be fully ready for combat. To add insult to
injury, billions more will be spent to fix defects in planes that were
rushed through production before they had been fully tested. The cost of
this "too big to fail" program is currently projected at \$1.5 trillion
over the lifetimes of the 2,400-plus aircraft currently planned for.
This means it is likely to become the most expensive weapons program in
the history of Pentagon procurement. Unfortunately, the F-35 is hardly
the only boondoggle that will continue to pad the coffers of defense
contractors while offering little in the way of defense (no less the
usual offense). A recent estimate from the Congressional Budget Office,
for example, suggests that a projected three-decade Pentagon plan to
build a new generation of nuclear-armed missiles, bombers, and
submarines, initiated under President Obama and close to the heart of
Donald Trump, will cost up to \$1.7 trillion dollars. This stunning
figure includes spending on new nuclear warheads under development at
the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration, one
of many channels for military spending that are outside the Pentagon's
already bloated budget. And given the history of such weapons systems
and the cost overruns that regularly accompany them, keep in mind that
\$1.7 trillion will probably prove a gross underestimate. The Government
Accountability Office, for instance, has released a report suggesting
that the program to build a new generation of ballistic missile
submarines, now priced at \$128 billion, is going to blow past that
figure. In recent years, hawks in Congress have been pressing for more
funding for missile defense and Donald Trump (with the help of "Little
Rocket Man") is their guy. David Willman of the Los Angeles Times
reports that the Trump administration wants to spend more than \$10
billion over the next five years beefing up a deeply flawed project for
placing ground-based missile interceptors in Alaska and California. This
is just one of a number of missile defense initiatives under way. In
2018, Lockheed, Boeing, and General Atomics are also scheduled to test
drones that will reportedly use lasers to shoot down intercontinental
ballistic missiles like those being developed by North Korea. It's a
program that will undoubtedly garner tens of billions of dollars more in
taxpayer funding in the years to come. And Congress isn't waiting until
a final Pentagon budget for 2018 is wrapped up to lavish more money on
missile defense contractors. A stopgap spending bill passed in late
December 2017 kept most programs at current levels, but offered a
special gift of nearly \$5 billion extra for anti-missile initiatives.
In addition, a congressionally financed study of the best place to base
an East Coast missile defense system \-- a favorite hobbyhorse of
Republicans on the House Armed Services Committee that even the Pentagon
has little interest in pursuing \-- is scheduled to be released later
this year. The Congressional Budget Office already suggests that the
price tag for that proposed system would be at least \$3.6 billion in
its first five years of development. Yet deploying it, as the Union of
Concerned Scientists has pointed out, would have little or no value when
it comes to protecting the United States from a missile attack. If the
project moves ahead, it won't be the first time Congress has launched a
costly, unnecessary spending program that the Pentagon didn't even
request. Cybersecurity has been another expanding focus of concern \--
and funding \-- in recent years, as groups ranging from the Democratic
National Committee to the National Security Agency have been hit by
determined hackers. The concern may be justified, but the solution \--
throwing billions at the Pentagon and starting a new Cyber Command to
press for yet more funding \-- is misguided at best. One of the biggest
bottlenecks to crafting effective cyber defenses is the lack of
personnel with useful and appropriate skills, a long-term problem that
short-term infusions of cash will not resolve. In any case, some of the
most vulnerable places \-- from the power grid to the banking system \--
will have to be dealt with by private firms that should be prodded by
stricter government regulations, a concept to which Donald Trump seems
to be allergic. As it happens, though, creating enforceable government
standards turns out to be one of the most important ways of addressing
cybersecurity challenges. [Despite the likely spending spree to come,
[don't expect]{.mark} the Pentagon, the [arms makers, their lobbyists,
or their allies in Congress, to stop crying out for more]{.mark}.
There's always a new weapons scheme or a new threat to hype or another
ill-conceived proposal for a military "solution" to a complicated
security problem. Trillions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of
lives later, the primary lesson from]{.underline} the [perpetual wars
and]{.underline} [profligate [weapons spending]{.mark}]{.underline} of
this century [should be that]{.underline} throwing more
[money]{.underline} at the Pentagon [[isn't making us]{.mark} any
[safer. But translating]{.mark} [that lesson into]{.mark} a [change in
Washington\'s]{.mark} spending patterns [would take major]{.mark} public
[pushback]{.mark} at a level [that has yet to
materialize]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This week, an investigation released by Al Jazeera showed how [NRA
lobbyists advised politicians from Australia's far-right One Nation
party]{.underline} who sought to loosen the nation's gun-control
measures and make firearms more accessible. Among other recommendations,
the NRA representatives suggested shaming gun-control groups after mass
shootings and ghost-writing columns in local newspapers. This was not an
isolated incident. In fact, just days after a gunman killed 50 people in
Christchurch, New Zealand, [figures affiliated with the NRA went into
overdrive arguing that New Zealand's gun-control measures led to the
massacre.]{.underline} Twitter accounts began tweeting the NRA's pro-gun
propaganda at New Zealand lawmakers and citizens, and the country's
pro-gun lobbyIsts began parroting NRA talking points. Similarly, at the
end of 2016, [prominent NRA-linked researchers appeared before the
Mexican Senate]{.underline} to discuss bringing in more firearms,
leading one Mexican newspaper to publish the headline, "The Mexican
Senate Opens its Doors to the National Rifle Association." So why would
an organization that wraps itself in the American flag and regularly
attacks gun-control supporters for importing "European-style" socialism
into the United States spend so much time working with pro-gun
politicians and advocates in places such as Brazil, Australia, Russia
and New Zealand --- all in an effort to push those nations to loosen
their gun laws? The likely answer is that **[the lobby is motivated to
find new international customers for American gun
manufacturers]{.underline}** and help foreign gun makers sell their
firearms in the U.S. market. After all, it gets a cut. The United States
is already the largest gun exporter in the world, with firearm exports
increasing over the past six years. A recent report from the Center for
American Progress concluded that U.S.-sourced guns "were used to commit
crimes in nearby countries approximately once every 31 minutes" between
2014 and 2016. And just last month, partly [**at the NRA's behest,** the
Trump administration made it even easier for U.S. weapons manufacturers
to send their products overseas by imposing a less onerous licensing
process for exporters.]{.underline} The new system will also make it
harder to track how American weapons are used globally. [As the NRA
itself admitted]{.underline} after the administration's rules became
public, [the goal of the measure is the "promotion of American industry,
innovation, and competitiveness."]{.underline}

The reality is that [the NRA]{.underline} has been exerting its

less crime. The lobbying group [has sought sway]{.underline} at the
United Nations [to make it easier to sell American guns overseas and has
on more than one occasion guided gun-rights groups in Brazil, Canada,
Australia and elsewhere]{.underline}. It advised gun activists in
Russia, entanglements that in recent years made the NRA vulnerable to
allegations it allowed alleged Russian operatives to use the
organization to influence American politics. While American gun rights
are enshrined in the U.S. Constitution --- something that doesn't
translate to most countries around the world --- the group's track
record of aggressively shaping the debate has nevertheless turned it
into the go-to group for other gun-rights activists outside the U.S.
[There are several reasons why the NRA doesn't confine itself to the
U.S.]{.underline} For one, [it's helpful to American gun makers if other
countries make it easier for citizens to buy and possess firearms,
opening up new markets. And when other countries ease restrictions, it
helps bolster one of the NRA's most prominent messages.]{.underline}

### Link---Small Arms -- NRA 

#### NRA is key to Trumps PC

Alex **Isenstadt, 7-3**-2019, \"NRA meltdown has Trump campaign
sweating,\" POLITICO,
<https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/03/nra-guns-trump-campaign-1395970>
//RS

[The N]{.underline}ational [R]{.underline}ifle [A]{.underline}ssociation
[aired an avalanche of TV ads]{.underline} and pushed its 5 million-plus
members to the polls [for Donald Trump]{.underline} in 2016, propelling
him in the Rust Belt states that delivered him the presidency. **[Now,
the gun rights group is in total meltdown]{.underline}** --- [and senior
Republicans]{.underline} and Trump 2020 officials [are
alarmed]{.underline}. In recent weeks, the NRA has seen everything from
a failed coup attempt to the departure of its longtime political
architect to embarrassing tales of self-dealing by top leaders. [The
turmoil is fueling fears that the organization will be profoundly
diminished heading into the election, leaving the Republican Party with
a gaping hole in its political machinery]{.underline}. With the Chamber
of Commerce and Koch political network withdrawing from their
once-dominant roles in electing conservatives, Republicans worry that
three organizations that have long formed the core of their electoral
infrastructure will be effectively on the sidelines. The predicament has
so troubled some Republicans that they are calling on the famously
secretive NRA to address its 2020 plans. Within the past week, [senators
have privately expressed concerns]{.underline} about the group to
National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Todd Young. ["No
organization has been more important to conservative voter education and
engagement than the NRA]{.underline}. We all hope they're able to mount
the kind of effort in the 2020 cycle they have in the past," said Gregg
Keller, a former American Conservative Union executive director. "But in
case they can't, given their current situation, I hope they're being
forthright about that within the movement so others can pick up the
slack." "The situation," he added, "has folks nervous." What makes the
NRA such a potent force for Republicans, party officials said, are its
reach into battlegrounds --- such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin,
North Carolina and Ohio --- and the sway it holds with its members. The
NRA's appeals play a critical role in turning out sportsmen, many of
whom have paid dues to the organization for years and regard it as an
important part of their lives. Chris LaCivita, a national GOP strategist
who's waged congressional and statewide campaigns in North Carolina,
said he remains confident gun advocates will turn out to vote in 2020.
But he said the NRA's problems could hobble its mobilization efforts.
["Infighting and accusations playing out almost daily in the national
media regarding the NRA have not been helpful. Clearly it will have an
impact in the NRA\'s ability to raise money, which would be used in
elections to turn out its membership]{.underline}," LaCivita said. With
the organization mired in palace intrigue and confronting a daily
barrage of negative publicity, some NRA officials are skeptical a 2020
plan will emerge. Many Republicans are convinced the job of turning out
Second Amendment supporters will fall to the cash-flush Republican
National Committee, which is constructing a massive get-out-the-vote and
data machine devoted to turning out conservatives. NRA convention in
Indianapolis Gun enthusiasts walk through the displays in the exhibition
hall at the National Rifle Association's annual meeting in Indianapolis
on April 27, 2019. The NRA was one of the most enthusiastic backers of
Donald Trump in 2016. \| Michael Conroy/AP Photo Jane Timken, chairwoman
of the Ohio GOP, said her organization would work closely with the RNC
to microtarget firearm owners. The national party, Timken noted, has
compiled extensive voter data through sources ranging from gun licenses
to gun magazine subscriptions. [Concerns over the NRA intensified last
week after the resignation of Chris Cox, who had been the head of its
lobbying arm since 2002]{.underline}. Cox was well-liked by NRA staff
and board members and had deep relationships with major donors and many
of the party's top strategists. He recently participated in 2020
planning meetings with the pro-Trump America First Action super PAC and
the anti-tax Club for Growth. The groups discussed polling and
opposition research, voter registration efforts, and ensuring smooth
coordination. With Cox gone, it\'s an open question who will oversee the
NRA's 2020 strategy. "Chris Cox is the guy everybody dealt with," said
Steven Law, president of the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC closely
aligned with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Jason Ouimet, a director
of federal affairs at the organization, is expected to assume Cox's role
on an interim basis, a person familiar with the move confirmed. Ouimet's
appointment, NRA officials said, is designed to temporarily stave off a
mass staff exodus and calm both the organization\'s members and the
broader conservative world. \"Anyone who chooses to discount us does so
at their peril,\" Ouimet said in a statement after this story was
published. \"The NRA is poised to mobilize the tens of millions of
Second Amendment supporters in the upcoming elections." The
organization\'s troubles are hard to overstate. The most serious threat
is an investigation by New York state attorney general\'s office into
its tax-exempt status. In April, NRA President Oliver North was ousted
in an ugly public spectacle in which he declared the group was in a
\"clear crisis.\" News organizations have also reported that NRA chief
executive Wayne LaPierre used \$275,000 of the group\'s money to buy
luxury clothes at Zegna in Beverly Hills, Calif., and that the
organization logged tens of thousands of dollars in other expenses that
benefited its officials. Trump weighed in on the NRA\'s problems Tuesday
morning, tweeting that the group is a \"victim\" of \"political
harassment by New York State and Governor Cuomo.\" Ken Blackwell, an NRA
board member who is active with an array of conservative groups,
disputed the idea that Cox's departure and the subsequent turmoil would
sideline the group in 2020. The NRA's turnout efforts, he said, were
largely orchestrated at the state and local levels. "Chris was good at
what he did, but he was not the reservoir of ground action," Blackwell
said. "This notion that there was someone sitting behind the green
curtain in Washington driving the base turnout, it was a misnomer."
Others argued that with Democratic presidential candidates vowing to
enact stricter gun control laws, firearm owners will be sufficiently
motivated to keep Trump in office. Issues surrounding the Republican
Party\'s outside infrastructure go beyond the NRA. The Chamber of
Commerce, a key player in Republican politics over the past decade,
spent just \$10 million during the 2018 cycle, about a third of what it
spent during the previous election cycle, according to the Center for
Responsive Politics. The scale back has led many to believe the
organization, a staple of the business community, is preparing to play a
diminished role in 2020. Other clues have emerged. In April, Chamber
leaders told The Washington Post they were seeking to rebrand the
organization as a bipartisan outfit. And in January, Rob Engstrom
stepped down as national political director, a role the Chamber is in
the process of filling. People familiar with the arrangement said
Engstrom remains a consultant with the organization. Scott Reed, the
group's chief political strategist, denied the group is retrenching.
This fall, he said, the Chamber would launch a multimillion-dollar
effort to defend the Republican Senate majority. "We will be spending
money earlier this cycle on the Senate than we've ever spent in the
100-year history of the Chamber," he said. Meanwhile, the Koch network
is gradually shifting away from partisanship and toward policy issues
like addressing poverty and drug addiction. The network, which like the
Chamber has at times found itself at odds with the president, plans to
sit out the 2020 presidential race and is recasting itself in a
nonpartisan fashion. Emily Seidel, chief executive of the Koch-backed
Americans for Prosperity, penned a memo last month in which she
announced the outfit is open to backing candidates from either party.
The new approach has rankled some longtime Koch donors, who complain the
powerful network --- which played a pivotal role in helping Republicans
capture the Senate majority --- is abandoning the GOP. Koch officials
dispute that they are pulling back, noting they've endorsed a handful of
GOP senators who align with the network's goals. When the network
gathered in Colorado Springs, Colo., over the weekend, its members were
joined by a small group of Republicans facing reelection, including
Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin and Georgia Sen. David Perdue. The uncertainty
surrounding all three groups is likely to increase pressure on America
First Action, a super PAC devoted to backing Trump. \"If a void needs to
be filled in 2020, we will fill it and continue to work with those
allies that are willing to step into the breach to help reelect Donald
Trump,\" America first spokeswoman Kelly Sadler said.. To others,
though, the developments are a potential sign of danger ahead. David
McIntosh, the president of the Club for Growth and a former Republican
congressman, said he was particularly troubled by the Koch network\'s
decision to refocus its efforts. After Barack Obama\'s 2008 election, he
noted, the network filled a vacuum by providing the devastated party
with much-needed infrastructure. "[Right now, the party is
functioning]{.underline},\" McIntosh said. \"**[But if you see another
collapse]{.underline}** or if we lose the White House, I [think **you're
going to see Republicans frankly in a world of hurt without a major
funding group like that."**]{.underline}

Neither the RNC nor Harris responded to questions about the resolution.
[Taiwan's Economic and Cultural Representative Office in
Washington]{.underline}, D.C. [said the RNC often passes resolutions
supporting Taiwan, and that the country has "a longstanding and solid
friendship" with the Republican Party. Taiwan engages in **extensive
lobbying of the U.S. government**]{.underline} --- not just
representatives and senators but congressional staffers and even
state-level officials --- that receives less public attention than that
of countries such as Israel and Saudi Arabia. The island nation is
viewed as a wayward province by China, and the two have been locked in a
bitter standoff since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. Taiwan,
eager to narrow China's military edge, has long seen the acquisition of
advanced U.S. weapons as a national priority. But such sales would stoke
already high tensions with Beijing, a risk that has led the past three
U.S. administrations to rebuff the island's demands for newer submarines
and fighter jets. "We expect our political leaders to be independent of
various interests," Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at the New America
Foundation's political reform program, told The Intercept. "They're
supposed to weigh the claims that various interests might have, and try
to evaluate them in some way. If they say, 'You know what? We're not
going to do that. We're just going to pick a side and let them write it
for us,' then what's the point of having political parties as
intermediaries? Why not just let lobbyists have seats in Congress?" Both
parties, Drutman said, often outsource the drafting of statements and
legislations to lobbyists, in a process with very limited transparency.
[With an]{.underline} **[army of lobbyists]{.underline}** [at its
command in Washington, Taiwan embarked last year on a **major push to
sway Congress and public opinion**]{.underline} [in favor of expanding
military ties between the two countries. In 2014 Taiwan had at least
seven lobbying groups on its payroll, at a total cost of more than
\$1.39 million. Leading the charge was former Republican Senate majority
leader and 1996 GOP presidential candidate Bob Dole]{.underline}, who
now works as a lobbyist for Alston & Bird. In the past year, Dole has
personally invited a number of former Bush administration officials,
including former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Secretary of
State Condoleezza Rice, to speak with Taiwanese diplomats. [Leveraging
his public image to Taiwan's advantage, he wrote an op-ed]{.underline}
that appeared in the Washington Times in January [in which he called for
increased arms sales to the island nation.]{.underline} "Taiwan's
greatest need is new submarines. It currently has four diesel electric
vessels, and these are, by military and technological standards,
ancient," Dole wrote in his Washington Times op-ed. "Our government,
apparently succumbing to intimidation, has taken no further action. Nor
has it agreed to enable Taiwan to buy new F-16 fighters --- another
glaring deficiency in the nation's arsenal." Dole's position as a paid
lobbyist for Taiwan was not disclosed by the publication, although Dole
did write that Taiwan "counts me among those assisting with its agenda
in Washington." [The lobbying push appears to have paid off. In 2014
Congress authorized the sale of four warships]{.underline} to the island
[and]{.underline} during the past year, [members of Congress introduced
three other bills and resolutions that stressed the importance of
Taiwan's defensive needs.]{.underline} Meanwhile, behind the scenes,
[lobbyists were busy inundating lawmakers with hundreds of emails and
phone calls, urging them to support Taiwan on Capitol Hill]{.underline}.
Several employees at one lobbying firm, the Washington-based Gephardt
Government Affairs, reached out to members of Congress and their staff
on at least 300 occasions between the months of February and July last
year, according to Justice Department records. Gephardt Government
Affairs was founded by prominent Democrat Dick Gephardt, House Majority
Leader from 1989 to 1995.

#### The House unanimously supported closer support, including arms sales, to Taiwan

pro-Taiwan bills, amid trade tensions with China", Reuters, 5/7/19,

//JSL

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - [The]{.underline} U.S. [House of
Representatives]{.underline} on Tuesday [**unanimously backed**
legislation supporting Taiwan]{.underline} which faces military and
diplomatic pressure from China as **[members of the U.S. Congress push
for a sharper approach to relations with Beijing.]{.underline}** China
expressed anger and said the bill should be blocked. The House passed
the measures as Washington and Beijing continue months-long trade talks.
China said on Tuesday Vice Premier Liu He would travel to Washington
this week, setting up a last-ditch bid for a deal that would avoid a
steep increase in tariffs ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump. The
House voted 414-0 for a non-binding resolution reaffirming the U.S.
commitment to Taiwan. [It also backed by unanimous voice vote the
"Taiwan Assurance Act of 2019," which supports Taiwan]{.underline} and
urges it to increase its defense spending, [noting]{.underline}
**[Washington should conduct "regular sales]{.underline}** [and defense
articles" to Taiwan]{.underline} and back Taipei's participation in
international organizations. There was no word on when the Assurance Act
might come up for a vote in the Senate, which would be necessary before
it could become law. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said
the bill was an interference in China's internal affairs and China had
already lodged "stern representations" with Washington about it. China
urged the United States to block the bill's progress and "appropriately
handle Taiwan-related issues to avoid seriously harming China-U.S.
cooperation on important areas and peace and stability in the Taiwan
Strait", he said. [Taiwan's foreign ministry said it welcomed the
"positive" move and expressed its gratitude.]{.underline} Taiwan would
"continue to work hand-in-hand with the U.S. authorities to firmly
deepen the Taiwan-U.S. partnership", it added in a statement. [The U.S.
measures reflect its concern over any efforts by Beijing to influence
Taiwan]{.underline}. Washington has no formal ties with Taipei, but is
bound by law to help provide the island with the means to defend itself
and is its main source of arms.

#### There's bipartisan support for arms sales to Taiwan -- assumes the most recent sale

**Seligman 7/3** -- Lara, Pentagon correspondent for Foreign Policy,
"Trump's Fighter Jet Sale to Taiwan Advances Despite China's Protests",
Foreign Policy, 7/3/19,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/07/03/trumps-fighter-jet-sale-to-taiwan-advances-despite-chinas-protests-f-16-lockheed-martin/>
//JSL

[The Trump administration's plan to sell more than 60 new F-16 fighter
jets to Taiwan is now moving forward after longer-than-anticipated
negotiations]{.underline}, paving the way for a deal that is sure to
prompt fresh protests from China only days after Washington and Beijing
agreed to restart trade talks. Taiwan formally submitted a request for
66 "Block 70" F-16 jets, the newest version of Lockheed Martin's legacy
fighter, earlier this year, but the deal took longer than expected to
hammer out due to negotiations over price and configuration of the
aircraft, two officials told Foreign Policy. [The goal is to move the
sale to the next step by the August congressional recess, according to
one administration official.]{.underline} However, it is not yet a done
deal. The request must be converted into a formal proposal by the
Defense and State Departments, and then formally notified to Congress.
Lawmakers would then have 30 days to block the sale. Taiwan already has
roughly 140 older "Block 20" F-16 jets that are currently being upgraded
to the newest standard. However, China has long said the U.S. selling
new F-16s to Taiwan would be a red line. "China's position to firmly
oppose arms sales to Taiwan is consistent and clear," Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in March, after reports emerged that
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration had given tacit approval
for the sale. "We have made stern representations to the U.S. We have
urged the U.S. to fully recognize the sensitivity of this issue and the
harm it will cause." If the deal does indeed move ahead, it is sure to
anger Beijing at a particularly delicate time for U.S.-China relations.
The two nations recently agreed to resume trade talks amid a
wide-ranging trade dispute that has roiled global markets. The agreement
came as Trump continued to ease restrictions on China, reportedly
removing eight companies from the Commerce Department's blacklist and
taking steps to allow telecommunications giant Huawei to purchase U.S.
technology But the pause in tensions may be only temporary. The United
States still has many concerns about China's subversive economic
practices, stealing of U.S. technology, ongoing military buildup, and
island-building campaign in the South China Sea. Taiwan has long been a
flash point for China, which does not recognize the island as an
independent nation. Beijing has opposed any attempt by Taiwan to declare
independence since 1949, when the two split after Mao Zedong's
Communists won China's civil war. The United States does not recognize
Taiwan, but the Taiwan Relations Act obligates the U.S. government to
help the island nation maintain self-defense capabilities. [The United
States has long sold weapons to Taiwan. The Trump administration
recently proposed a separate arms sale to Taipei]{.underline}, including
more than \$2 billion worth of Abrams tanks, portable antitank missile
systems, and other military equipment. If approved, the sale would mark
one of the largest to Taiwan in recent years by the United States. But
the new F-16 sale, which would be valued at a much higher price point,
would be significantly more provocative. Previous administrations,
including former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, rejected
Taiwan's request to buy new F-16s, likely so as not to provoke Beijing.
But the Trump administration has recently become more concerned that an
attack by China on Taiwan might come sooner rather than later. In
January, Chinese President Xi Jinping warned that any independence
efforts by Taiwan could be met by armed force, implicitly threatening
the United States if it tried to intervene. "**[There is a consensus
that's almost bipartisan in Washington that it's time to be a bit more
assertive against China]{.underline}**," [Richard Aboulafia, an analyst
with the Teal Group, told Foreign Policy]{.underline} in March. "[This
is the part where fighters are geopolitics with wings."]{.underline} A
State Department official said: "As a matter of policy, we do not
comment or confirm proposed defense sales until they are formally
notified to Congress."

<https://www.cato.org/blog/poking-panda-hawks-push-stronger-us-support-taiwan>
//JSL

[Taiwan's supporters in Congress and the Trump administration are
pushing unprecedented measures to increase Washington's backing for the
island]{.underline}'s de facto independence from China. On March 1, [the
Senate passed the Taiwan Travel Act, which the House of Representatives
had previously approved]{.underline} in January. The TTA states that it
should be the policy of the United States to authorize officials at all
levels to visit Taiwan to meet with their counterparts and allow
high-level Taiwanese officials to enter the United States for meetings
with U.S. officials. Notably, the TTA specifically encouraged
interaction by "cabinet-level national security officials." As I note in
a new article in China-U.S. Focus, although [the measure]{.underline}
does not compel the executive branch to change policy, it **[clearly
underscores the congressional desire for closer U.S. ties, especially
defense ties, with Taiwan's government]{.underline}**. [Since the Senate
passed the legislation with no dissenting votes, it reinforced the
intensity of the congressional position]{.underline}. That President
Trump signed the legislation instead of letting it go into effect
without his signature signaled his agreement with the substance.
Although it was not a legal requirement, Washington's policy since it
switched official diplomatic relations from Taipei to Beijing in 1979
has been to authorize only low-level (usually economic) policymakers to
interact with their Taiwanese counterparts. Prominent officials such as
the President, Secretary of State, and Secretary of Defense, refrain
from doing so. That situation is now likely to change. [Congressional
activists also are pushing a new gesture of support for
Taiwan]{.underline}, even though Beijing's strong protests in response
to the TTA have barely begun to subside. [Two key Republican senators,
John Cornyn]{.underline} (R-TX) [and James Inhofe]{.underline} (R-OK),
[are urging President Trump to approve the sale of F-35 fighters to
Taipei. Cornyn is the assistant majority leader and Inhofe is a senior
member of the Armed Services Committee, so their support for such a sale
is not a minor matter.]{.underline}

#### The plan is unpopular -- there's bipartisan support for arms sales to Taiwan and against policies designed to improve relations with China

[**A bipartisan group of senators** urged]{.underline} President Donald

[arms sales to Taiwan amid]{.underline} **[congressional
concern]{.underline}** [the White House is ready to curry favor with
Beijing]{.underline} at Taipei's expense. Four Republicans and four
Democrats wrote a letter to Trump urging him to maintain firm U.S.
support for Taiwan, including providing weapons it needs to defend
itself against China, regardless of Washington's diplomatic initiatives
with Beijing. ["We urge you to adopt a policy of regular and consistent
support for Taiwan's self-defense efforts and not allow concerns about
China to take precedence over Taiwan," according to the
letter]{.underline} obtained by Foreign Policy. The senators also cite a
"small" number of pending arms sales to Taiwan. The administration has
yet to formally notify Congress about those sales, a critical step in
proceeding with an arms deal. "We urge your administration to send those
notifications to Congress immediately," the letter states. "While modest
in scope, they represent an important marker in maintaining consistent
U.S. support for Taiwan." [Washington's backing for Taipei is
particularly important]{.underline} given that "China has intensified
its economic coercion and military intimidation tactics" against Taiwan
since the election of President Tsai Ing-wen, raising tensions in the
Taiwan Strait, [the senators wrote]{.underline}. [The letter reflects
**anxiety**]{.underline} in Taiwan, and **[among some U.S. officials and
lawmakers that Trump could undercut four decades of support for
Taipei]{.underline}**, by design or neglect. In April, Trump told
Reuters that he would consult with Chinese President Xi Jinping before
speaking to Taiwan's president to avoid causing "difficulty" for
Beijing.

Yet, contrary to such complaints, it is the PRC whose actions have upset
the status quo of stability in the Indo-Pacific region. For example, in
a speech in February, Representative Ted Yoho, chairman of the House
Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, noted that China's
declaration in January of the M503 flight path was a unilateral change
of the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.2 Overall, [Taiwan's sense of
insecurity]{.underline} as a result of such actions [prompts it to seek
assurances and assistance from the United States, especially by engaging
with the legislative branch]{.underline}. Although [congressional
actions]{.underline} might at times seem strong relative to inconsistent
presidential implementation of policy, such oversight [has been critical
for ensuring the president's adherence to the Taiwan Relations Act and
thus for maintaining the continuity and consistency of U.S. policy on
Taiwa]{.underline}n. This essay will discuss recent congressional
support for Taiwan's stronger self-defense, specific drivers of salient
language in the NDAAs, and the implications of this legislation for U.S.
policy toward Taiwan. While naval port calls generated particular
controversy, the consequential part of the latest NDAA is the
requirement that the defense secretary shall report to Congress in order
to normalize the arms sales process for Taiwan. CONGRESSIONAL CONCERNS
AND SUPPORT FOR A STRONGER TAIWAN Overall, [congressional oversight
ensures the president's adherence to the Taiwan Relations
Act]{.underline}, enacted in 1979. In addition, [Congress uniquely acts
as guarantor in the U.S. government to maintain the Six Assurances that
President Ronald Reagan offered to Taiwan]{.underline} in 1982.3 [Many
members see shared interests between the United States and
Taiwan]{.underline}, a fellow democracy, [and have issued statements and
taken actions supporting closer engagement with the island]{.underline}.
When the Trump administration notified Congress of arms sales to Taiwan
in June 2017, [Senators Bob Menendez (the ranking Democrat on the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee) and James Inhofe (the second-highest
ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee]{.underline},
after the chairman John McCain) issued a bipartisan statement as
co-chairs of the Senate Taiwan Caucus. They [expressed support for the
arms sales as promoting U.S. interests]{.underline} in a peaceful
resolution of the Taiwan question and a strong, vibrant, and democratic
Taiwan.4 In a bipartisan letter to President Donald Trump before his
visit to Beijing in November 2017, which Taiwan feared would result in a
deal at its expense, [Representatives Ed Royce and Eliot Engel (the
chairman and ranking member, respectively, of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee) reminded the president that the United States and Taiwan
"have fostered a close relationship that has been of significant
strategic and economic benefit to both nations]{.underline}; and our two
peoples are bound by shared values of democracy, human rights, and rule
of law."5 Likewise, in December 2017, after a PRC diplomat threatened
Taiwan, [Senator Tom Cotton promptly issued a statement in which
he]{.underline} countered, "I take Beijing's threats to use military
force against Taiwan seriously. That's why I [urge both the president
and Congress to accelerate the sale of defensive weapons to
Taiwan]{.underline}, as well as to bring Taiwan into joint military
exercises with the United States. We can't afford to take Beijing's
saber-rattling lightly."6 In February 2018, Senator Inhofe led a
delegation of the Senate and House Armed Services Committees to visit
Taiwan and other partners. Inhofe expressed U.S. support for Taiwan:
"With China becoming more aggressive and intent on expanding its
influence globally, the United States--Taiwan security relationship is
now more important than ever."7 The congressional delegation met with
Taiwan's president Tsai Ing-wen and senior ministers.

[Any move to downgrade military links with Taiwan would surely generate
domestic political fallout.]{.underline} Even PRC authorities
acknowledge **[the]{.underline}** Obama **[administration is under
pressure to sell arms to Taiwan]{.underline}** and cannot easily cut off
the island.33 Coming at a time when [members of both major political
parties are calling for Washington to enhance ties with
Taipei]{.underline}, and when public opinion polls show many Americans
still hold negative views of the PRC, [an administration would have to
be prepared for criticism]{.underline}. Conceivably, terminating
America's security support for Taiwan could cause some independence
activists in Taiwan to take more aggressive steps to achieve their goal.
In other words, the problem with this option is that there could be many
unintended consequences.

Neither the RNC nor Harris responded to questions about the resolution.
[Taiwan's Economic and Cultural Representative Office in
Washington]{.underline}, D.C. [said the RNC often passes resolutions
supporting Taiwan, and that the country has "a longstanding and solid
friendship" with the Republican Party. Taiwan engages in **extensive
lobbying of the U.S. government**]{.underline} --- not just
representatives and senators but congressional staffers and even
state-level officials --- that receives less public attention than that
of countries such as Israel and Saudi Arabia. The island nation is
viewed as a wayward province by China, and the two have been locked in a
bitter standoff since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. Taiwan,
eager to narrow China's military edge, has long seen the acquisition of
advanced U.S. weapons as a national priority. But such sales would stoke
already high tensions with Beijing, a risk that has led the past three
U.S. administrations to rebuff the island's demands for newer submarines
and fighter jets. "We expect our political leaders to be independent of
various interests," Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at the New America
Foundation's political reform program, told The Intercept. "They're
supposed to weigh the claims that various interests might have, and try
to evaluate them in some way. If they say, 'You know what? We're not
going to do that. We're just going to pick a side and let them write it
for us,' then what's the point of having political parties as
intermediaries? Why not just let lobbyists have seats in Congress?" Both
parties, Drutman said, often outsource the drafting of statements and
legislations to lobbyists, in a process with very limited transparency.
[With an]{.underline} **[army of lobbyists]{.underline}** [at its
command in Washington, Taiwan embarked last year on a **major push to
sway Congress and public opinion**]{.underline} [in favor of expanding
military ties between the two countries. In 2014 Taiwan had at least
seven lobbying groups on its payroll, at a total cost of more than
\$1.39 million. Leading the charge was former Republican Senate majority
leader and 1996 GOP presidential candidate Bob Dole]{.underline}, who
now works as a lobbyist for Alston & Bird. In the past year, Dole has
personally invited a number of former Bush administration officials,
including former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Secretary of
State Condoleezza Rice, to speak with Taiwanese diplomats. [Leveraging
his public image to Taiwan's advantage, he wrote an op-ed]{.underline}
that appeared in the Washington Times in January [in which he called for
increased arms sales to the island nation.]{.underline} "Taiwan's
greatest need is new submarines. It currently has four diesel electric
vessels, and these are, by military and technological standards,
ancient," Dole wrote in his Washington Times op-ed. "Our government,
apparently succumbing to intimidation, has taken no further action. Nor
has it agreed to enable Taiwan to buy new F-16 fighters --- another
glaring deficiency in the nation's arsenal." Dole's position as a paid
lobbyist for Taiwan was not disclosed by the publication, although Dole
did write that Taiwan "counts me among those assisting with its agenda
in Washington." [The lobbying push appears to have paid off. In 2014
Congress authorized the sale of four warships]{.underline} to the island
[and]{.underline} during the past year, [members of Congress introduced
three other bills and resolutions that stressed the importance of
Taiwan's defensive needs.]{.underline} Meanwhile, behind the scenes,
[lobbyists were busy inundating lawmakers with hundreds of emails and
phone calls, urging them to support Taiwan on Capitol Hill]{.underline}.
Several employees at one lobbying firm, the Washington-based Gephardt
Government Affairs, reached out to members of Congress and their staff
on at least 300 occasions between the months of February and July last
year, according to Justice Department records. Gephardt Government
Affairs was founded by prominent Democrat Dick Gephardt, House Majority
Leader from 1989 to 1995.

#### Congress overwhelmingly supports Taiwan -- the Taiwan Assurance Act proves

**Mazza 19** -- Michael, visiting fellow at AEI with a M.A. in
international relations from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced and
International Studies, "Senators introduce Taiwan Assurance Act in move
to review US-Taiwan relations", American Enterprise Institute, 3/27/19,
<http://www.aei.org/publication/senators-introduce-taiwan-assurance-act-in-move-to-review-us-taiwan-relations/>
//JSL

[Congress continues to act as a]{.underline} **[bastion of support for
the US-Taiwan relationship]{.underline}**. Just this week, [Senator Tom
Cotton]{.underline} (R-AR), [along with Senators Robert
Menendez]{.underline} (D-NJ), [Marco Rubio]{.underline} (R-FL), [Ted
Cruz]{.underline} (R-TX), [Catherine Cortez Masto]{.underline} (D-NV),
[and Chris Coons]{.underline} (D-DE) [introduced the Taiwan Assurance
Act. The bipartisan bill]{.underline}, unveiled in advance of the Taiwan
Relations Act's 40th anniversary in April, [takes note of the "close
relationship" between Taiwan and the United States and of that
relationship's "enormous benefit to both parties]{.underline} and to the
Indo-Pacific region as a whole." It also takes note of China's ongoing
efforts to isolate, intimidate, and otherwise threaten the island.
Non-binding language in [the Taiwan Assurance Act calls for "regular
transfers of defense articles to Taiwan]{.underline}," resumption of
trade and investment talks "with the goal of reaching a bilateral free
trade agreement," and US advocacy for Taiwan's "meaningful
participation" in international organizations. Binding language mandates
that the defense attaché at the American Institute in Taiwan be a
general or flag officer and requires the secretary of defense to "make
efforts to include Taiwanese forces in bilateral and multilateral
military exercises." This latter provision marks a step beyond previous
legislation that described the "sense of Congress" as supporting
Taiwan's inclusion in such exercises. The Taiwan Assurance Act requires
that the president submits to the House and Senate foreign affairs
committees a report on the results of a State Department review of its
Guidelines on Relations with Taiwan and on implementation of the Taiwan
Travel Act. The Act encourages, but does not mandate, that the State
Department guidelines "be crafted with the intent to deepen and expand
United States-Taiwan relations," in accord with "the reality that Taiwan
is governed by a representative democratic government ... and that
Taiwan is a free and open society that respects universal human rights
and democratic values," and "be consistent with the longstanding,
comprehensive, strategic, and values-based relationship." Senator Cotton
here aims to bring about a revision of the State Department guidelines,
which have long inhibited smooth bilateral relations. That State
Department officials cannot meet Taiwan counterparts in executive office
buildings is an inconvenience that, one imagines, must have at times
deterred such meetings. Refusal to treat visiting Taiwan dignitaries
with the formalities and honors granted other foreign visitors denies
them dignity without meaningfully advancing US interests in Asia.
Ensuring that Taiwan's foreign and defense ministers do not step foot in
Washington, DC---indeed, keeping them outside the Beltway
entirely---denies American senior national security officials
opportunities to engage with counterparts from a country with whom the
United States could one day conceivably fight alongside in a conflict
with a rival nuclear power. [The Cotton bill builds upon other
legislation that relates to Taiwan.]{.underline} Last month, Senator
Marco Rubio introduced the Countering the Chinese Government and
Communist Party's Political Influence Operations Act. While the act is
primarily concerned with countering malign People Republic of China's
(PRC) influence in the United States, it does describe US policy as, in
part, "to enhance cooperation and coordination with Australia, Canada,
New Zealand, and Taiwan ... whose governments and institutions have
faced acute pressure from the political influence operations of the
Government of China and the Communist Party of China." This language not
only recognizes the severe challenge Taiwan faces, but also treats
Taiwan as no different from countries with which the United States has
official diplomatic relations. [Taken together, a number of acts in
recent years]{.underline}---notably the national defense authorization
acts, the Taiwan Travel Act, and the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act
(ARIA)---[have put the US-Taiwan relationship on firmer
footing]{.underline}, pushing it towards a more normal relationship. In
2017, when Senator Cory Gardner first announced his intention to
introduce ARIA, he promised that the bill would "unequivocally back
Taiwan as our important security partner, including authorizing new arms
sales and providing for enhanced diplomatic contacts in Taipei." The
senator delivered on that promise. ARIA, which President Trump signed
into law in late 2018, listed Taiwan among America's most important
security partners in Asia, a list that includes US treaty allies. The
act reaffirmed US commitment to Taiwan in the economic, diplomatic, and
security realms; called for regular arms sales to Taiwan; and encouraged
"the travel of high level United States officials to Taiwan, in
accordance with the Taiwan Travel Act." Senator Gardner further
reinforced this commitment in a speech at a joint Global Taiwan
Institute-Project 2049 Institute event earlier this month. [The
congressional view on US-Taiwan relations, Gardner said, "is that the
United States must consistently grow our relationship with
Taipei.]{.underline}" Perhaps even more ambitiously, "we must pursue
every available avenue of cooperation with Taipei allowable under US
law." Indeed, there is not actually much activity that US law disallows
when it comes to US-Taiwan cooperation. To whit, in February, Gardner,
Cotton, and three other senators addressed a letter to Speaker of the
House Nancy Pelosi encouraging her to invite Taiwan President Tsai
Ing-wen to address a joint session of Congress. Such an invitation,
while unlikely, would be unprecedented but entirely consistent with US
law and, arguably, with the American "One China" policy as well.

#### The TRA is firmly entrenched in US politics -- Congress wouldn't be happy about letting the president shirk it

**deLisle 19** -- Jacques, Director of FPRI's Asia Program, Stephen A.
Cozen Professor of Law, Professor of Political Science, Director of the
Center for East Asian Studies and Deputy Director of the Center for the
Study of Contemporary China at the University of Pennsylvania, "The
Taiwan Relations Act at 40: Political Entrenchment of Foreign Policy

//JSL

[The TRA is entrenched---and entrenches U.S. Taiwan
policy]{.underline}---also [because of features of U.S. constitutional
law and politics]{.underline}, specifically the separation of powers.
Policy proclamations from the executive branch, joint communiqués, or
statements issued by officials of the U.S. and other governments, and
the like, are actions by one branch of government---albeit the dominant
one in foreign affairs. They thus can be altered or reversed by the
unilateral action of that same, single branch. As the litigation over
Carter's termination of the U.S.-ROC mutual defense treaty made clear,
even binding international agreements can be changed by the president
alone without the consent of the legislative branch. [As legislation
passed by Congress and signed by the president, the TRA is]{.underline}
qualitatively different---[inalterable until subsequent legislation
changes it]{.underline}. Separation of powers-related politics further
insulates and entrenches the TRA and its policies. [Although the
president is relatively dominant in foreign affairs]{.underline} and
Congress often shirks its limited responsibility by leaving the
president to take the risk of foreign policy failures, much of the time,
**[U.S. policy concerning Taiwan has not been an area where Congress has
been strongly inclined to cede power or duck controversial
issues]{.underline}**. [The relatively robust textual provisions in the
TRA concerning presidential reporting, congressional review, and
congressional oversight reflect at least an intention by the TRA's
framers to bind and monitor the president]{.underline} on Taiwan policy.
[Recently, Congress has become exceptionally active]{.underline},
departing from the long-prevailing pattern of considering but not
passing legislation relating to Taiwan's status and security. [In
2018-2019, Congress passed, and the president signed, a National Defense
Authorization Act, the Taiwan Travel Act, and the Asia Reassurance
Initiative Act.]{.underline} Making declarations of U.S. policy and
urging---but not purporting to require---the president to take action,
these laws call for possible mutual port calls by the American and
Taiwanese navies, reciprocal visits by high-level officials of the U.S.
and ROC governments, and enforcement of "all existing commitments"
consistent with the TRA, the three Joint Communiqués, and the Six
Assurances (as well as taking steps to counter efforts by Beijing to
change the status quo and to support efforts by Taiwan to strengthen
asymmetric defense capabilities). Another, more accidental aspect of the
TRA has contributed to entrenching U.S. policy commitments to Taiwan.
[The TRA regularly generates moments of political focus. Its arms sales
provision has meant that there will be relatively regular requests and
offers of tranches of weapons sales, which are a tangible and symbolic
reaffirmation of the U.S.'s support for Taiwan's security]{.underline},
even more so in the face of the opposition and denunciation that
inevitably issue forth (albeit with varying intensity) from Beijing.
[The TRA]{.underline}---a pivotal and largely unchanged law---[has a
strongly commemorated enactment date]{.underline}. Every decade or
half-decade anniversary brings statements of celebration of, and support
for, the TRA from official Taipei and official Washington. This year,
the TRA's 40th birthday is especially pointed, coming less than a year
after the opening---and just weeks before the official opening---of the
new USD 255 million AIT complex in Taipei's Neihu district.

#### Strong connections give Taiwan a strong base of support in Congress

**Bush 19** -- Richard, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who
holds The Michael H. Armacost Chair and Chen-Fu and Cecilia Yen Koo
Chair in Taiwan Studies in the Center for East Asia Policy Studies and a
joint appointment as a senior fellow in the Brookings John L. Thornton
China Center, "Danger ahead? Taiwan's politics, China's ambitions, and
US policy", Brookings, 4/15/19,
<https://www.brookings.edu/on-the-record/danger-ahead-taiwans-politics-chinas-ambitions-and-us-policy/>
//JSL

There is the perception in China that [Congress is actively contributing
to the pro-Taiwan side of administration policy]{.underline}. It is
indeed true that **[Taiwan has a lot of support in the
Congress]{.underline}**. [That is mainly a function of the anti-China
mood on Capitol Hill. It also reflects the connections between
Taiwanese-American communities in the United States and individual
Members of Congress]{.underline}. What is worth noting, however, is that
the pieces of legislation that Congress has passed so far to encourage
enhanced diplomatic and military interaction with Taiwan has no binding
effect. They express sentiments and make suggestions but do not require
the president to do anything he may prefer not to do. If these pieces of
legislation were cast in the form of orders, moreover, they would
arguably encroach on the president's constitutional powers as commander
in chief and head diplomat.

### Link -- Taiwan -- GOP

[The president faces pressure from Taipei\'s Republican allies to take a
harder line]{.underline} that infuriates Beijing, which has threatened
to invade its island neighbor. TAIPEI --- A year after a newly elected
Donald Trump enraged China by taking a congratulatory phone call from
the president of [Taiwan]{.underline}, the pro-American island nation
[is pleading for Trump's protection against Beijing's
bullying.]{.underline} At the same time, **[Republicans in Congress are
pressuring Trump with pro-Taiwan legislation]{.underline}** that could
strain his delicate relationship with China. China is already warning
Trump to back off: One senior Chinese diplomat visiting Washington in
December warned that his country would invade Taiwan if U.S. Navy ships
dock in Taiwanese ports, an idea proposed in the annual defense spending
bill Trump signed in December. In exclusive interviews here with
POLITICO, [Taiwanese officials urged Trump to stand firm,]{.underline}
saying Beijing has stepped up a campaign of political and military
intimidation during the president's first year in office. "Mainland
China has a big strategy to exercise more political pressure toward
Taiwan," said Chang Hsiao-Yueh, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council
Minister. Chang and other officials here urged the Trump administration
to step up its support for Taipei. The result is a foreign policy
conundrum for Trump, who has said he wants to stand up to China's
regional aggression --- but who also wants Chinese President Xi
Jinping's help on North Korea and trade issues. While Trump's Taiwan
policy remains unclear, [Congress is taking a lead role. In January, the
House passed legislation encouraging more diplomatic contacts between
Trump officials and their Taiwanese counterparts.]{.underline} That,
too, has angered Beijing, which considers Taiwan a "renegade province"
of China that should not have direct relations with America. A Jan. 10
editorial in the hawkish Beijing newspaper Global Times called the
measure "unimaginable in the past" and said it showed that "forces in
the US are attempting to flare up the Taiwan question ... and use it as
leverage against China." Last week, a spokesman for China's Taiwan
affairs office said the bill "severely violates" established policy
between the U.S., China and Taiwan, which has discouraged direct
contacts between officials in Washington and Taipei. Taiwan has been a
thorn in U.S.-China relations for decades. Beijing does not recognize
the sovereignty of Taiwan, a holdout for anti-communist forces after
China's civil war ended in 1949. The U.S. treats Taiwan as a sovereign
nation and sells it advanced weaponry. But through a complicated
diplomatic understanding known as the "one-China" policy, the U.S.
recognizes the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government
of China and not the Republic of China (the official name of Taiwan).
That's why Trump's Dec. 2, 2016, phone call with Taiwan President Tsai
Ing-wen so angered China. Trump, in a February call with Xi, smoothed
feathers --- and disappointed some China hawks in Congress by
reaffirming the U.S.'s one-China policy, though he also suggested it
could be tied to China's willingness to bargain on trade and other
issues. That, in turn has alarmed some Taiwanese leaders who fear that
Trump may see their country as a potential bargaining chip in his
dealings with Xi. Trump may be "prepared to use the fate of the 23
million people in Taiwan as a bargaining chip to negotiate stronger
Chinese assistance on resolving the North Korean nuclear issue or to
rebalance the U.S.-China economic relationship," Paul Haenle, director
of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center, wrote last year. "Trump, being the
businessman that he is, always looking to do deals. He sees
international relations as transactions," said Jason Hsu, a member of
Taiwan's legislature representing the opposition KMT party. "Ultimately,
he is not concerned about human rights, freedom, democracy, freedom of
speech, these are not in his thinking." Trump has sent mixed and unclear
signals about relations with Taiwan and China, said Wang Ting-yu, a
legislator and member of Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party. "The vague
message is sometimes more dangerous than missiles," Wang added. [Trump
did approve the sale of \$1.4 billion in U.S. arms to Taiwan last
June]{.underline}. But unease on the island is growing amid what
Taiwanese officials call an escalating Chinese campaign of intimidation
against its much smaller neighbor. Chinese warplanes have increased
flights around Taiwan --- with sorties of fighters and bombers armed to
attack, according to Taiwan's defense ministry. In early January, China
started flying commercial jets through several lanes in the Taiwan
Strait, violating a 2015 agreement. Taiwan calls the flights a
"reckless" safety hazard. [The provocations are angering Taiwan's
champions on Capitol Hill,]{.underline} where Beijing is battling
efforts to provide Taipei with more robust U.S. support. [Sen. Marco
Rubio criticized China's new air routes]{.underline} as "a violation of
the longstanding cross-strait status quo." [Another champion of
Taiwan]{.underline} and supporter of the travel bill, [is Sen. Ted
Cruz]{.underline} (R-Tex.), who met with Tsai in Houston on Jan. 8, 2017
despite Beijing's strong objections.

#### Top Republicans support arms sales to Taiwan

//JSL

Two **[top Republican senators]{.underline}** on Monday [urged President
Trump to sell Taiwan F-35 or F-16 fighter jets to bolster the small
nation's air defense and deter "China\'s aggressive military
posture."]{.underline} In a letter, Senate Whip John
[Cornyn]{.underline} (R-Texas) [and]{.underline} Senate Armed Services
Committee member James [Inhofe]{.underline} (R-Okla.) [asked Trump to
"commit to providing new, U.S.-made fighters to aid in Taiwan\'s
self-defense." "After years of military modernization, China shows the
ability to wage war against Taiwan for the first time since the 1950s.
However, with your leadership, it is possible to help Taiwan remain a
democracy, free to establish a relationship with China that is not
driven by military coercion," the senators wrote.]{.underline} Earlier
this month, Taiwan defense officials publicly confirmed they were still
interested in acquiring the Lockheed Martin-made F-35 joint strike
fighters. Cornyn and Inhofe wrote that President Tsai Ing-wen had
specifically asked about buying the Marine Corps' F-35B variant, which
takes off and lands vertically. An F-35 sale would add to Taiwan's aging
fleet of F-16 Fighting Falcons, which the United States sold the nation
in 1993. The older and dwindling F-16s --- down from 150 original
fighters to 65 field-ready planes --- are "not enough to maintain a
credible defense" against China, according to the senators. \"The
survivability of the F-35B and modern long-range sensors could help
Taiwan intercept Chinese missiles, promoting deterrence well into the
next decade,\" they wrote. But should a F-35B sale be premature, Cornyn
and Inhofe suggested that Trump sell Taiwan newer Lockheed F-16Vs. ["If
Taiwan\'s air defense fleet is allowed to degenerate in number and
quality, I am concerned that it would be destabilizing and would
encourage Chinese aggression to ensue," they wrote. "Additionally, I am
concerned that Taiwan\'s military weakness and the inability to mount a
credible air force would place an undue burden on forward-deployed U.S.
forces in North East Asia."]{.underline}

## Ukraine 

### Link---Ukraine -- 1nc

#### Plan saps pc -- sales to Ukraine enjoy bipartisan support and help Trump rebuke criticism that he's too soft on Putin

**Desiderio, 18**--- former congressional reporter for The Daily Beast,

"Trump Administration Approves New Weapons Sale to Ukraine, Bucking

AS)

[The Trump administration]{.underline} on Thursday [approved a massive
new weapons sale to Ukraine]{.underline}, as that country continues to
defend itself against Russian-backed separatists. [The decision
represents a **show of force against**]{.underline} Russian President
Vladimir **[Putin]{.underline}**, as the United States and its allies
continue to accuse Moscow of destabilizing eastern Europe and the Middle
East through the use of military incursions and cyber warfare. [The \$47
million sale includes 210 Javelin anti-tank missiles and 37 launch
units]{.underline}, the State Department said, [and it comes less than
three months after the administration approved a similar **lethal
defensive weapons** sale.]{.underline} "This proposed sale will
contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United
States by improving the security of Ukraine," the department said. "The
Javelin system will help Ukraine build its long-term defense capacity to
defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity in order to meet its
national defense requirements." [Congress has 30 days to nix the sale,
but lawmakers from both parties have been supportive of such measures in
the past and are unlikely to block it. **Republicans**, in particular,
have **praised the administration** for approving weapons sales to
Ukraine in the past, and]{.underline} have [pointed to those actions to
rebut criticisms that the Trump administration hasn't been tough enough
on Russia]{.underline}---[particularly when it comes to]{.underline}
mandatory [sanctions]{.underline} against Moscow, many of which have not
yet been implemented as required by law. [Democrats]{.underline} have
derided President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson over
the non-implementation of new sanctions against Russia that Congress
passed overwhelmingly last year. But when it comes to providing military
assistance to Ukraine and sanctioning alleged Russian human-rights
abusers, they've [praised Trump and other top officials.]{.underline}
Thursday's announcement runs counter to a controversial change that was
made to the Republican party platform in 2016. The Daily Beast reported
at the time that top Trump campaign officials tried to soften language
in the party's official platform about military aid to Ukraine in order
to make it more Russia-friendly. Trump's former campaign chairman Paul
Manafort, who has been indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller, used
to work for Ukraine's pro-Kremlin former president, Viktor Yanukovych.
In December, a GOP delegate said Trump himself was directly involved in
the platform change. [Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-TX), the chairman of the
House Armed Services Committee]{.underline}, told The Daily Beast on
Wednesday that the [administration should be **doing more to ensure that
Moscow pays a price**]{.underline}---including the full implementation
of those congressionally mandated sanctions. Still, [Thornberry
said]{.underline} Thursday, [Trump's team is doing more to counter
Russian aggression than the Obama administration.]{.underline}
"[By]{.underline} renewing strategies to confront Russia in the National
Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy, [agreeing to help arm
Ukraine]{.underline} and restoring America's military strength, [the
Trump administration is taking important steps to turn that trend
around]{.underline}, but much more needs to be done," Thornberry said in
a statement. The timing of Thursday's weapons announcement likely wasn't
lost on top administration officials. It came on the same day that Putin
revealed that Russia has successfully developed "invincible" nuclear
weapons that can "reach anywhere in the world."

2018 defense bill authorized US to provide Ukraine maritime aid

WASHINGTON --- [Lawmakers **from both sides of the aisle** are
pressuring U.S. President Donald Trump to take a **tougher line on
Moscow**]{.underline} after an incident at sea between Ukraine and
Russia, which is ratcheting tensions between the two neighbors. Several
lawmakers expressed concerns after the Ukrainian navy said Russian ships
fired on and seized three of its artillery ships Sunday, wounding six
Ukrainian crew members. Russia also closed the Kerch Strait, a key
waterway between the Azov Sea and Black Sea, placing the two countries
the closest they've been to open conflict since Moscow annexed Crimea
from Ukraine in 2014. The incident suggests U.S. and European actions
have failed to deter Russian aggression and raised the question whether
Trump will attempt to rally allies As the conflict unfolded on Sunday,
Trump hit European partners with a Twitter attack over NATO
burden-sharing: "The European Union, for many years, has taken advantage
of us on Trade, and then they don't live up to their Military commitment
through NATO. Things must change fast! [Though several world leaders
have blamed Russian aggression]{.underline} in the incident, [Trump
seemed reluctant to do so]{.underline} Monday [when reporters asked how
he felt about the clash]{.underline}. [Trump said, "not good. Not happy
about it at all," adding, "we do not like what's happening either way.
And hopefully it will get straightened out."]{.underline} On Monday,
[the House Foreign Affairs Committee's ranking member, Rep. Eliot Engel,
D-N.Y., said Trump was **sending the wrong message**,]{.underline} that
NATO is divided and unwilling to react, just as Russian President
Vladimir Putin is testing its resolve. [Engel]{.underline}, likely to
become the [committee chairman]{.underline} when the House comes under
Democratic control [in January, called for a unified and forceful
response from the U.S. and its allies,]{.underline} short of war. "We
have to work with our allies in the NATO alliance, and what bothers me
is President Trump has trashed the NATO alliance," Engel told Defense
News on Monday. "[It's very difficult when you have the president
cozying up to Putin once again, not having a very strong response so
far]{.underline} --- letting Putin think there will be a lot of
handwringing and talk, but not a lot of action." "I [think it was pretty
poor taste and timing for the president to issue a statement about
burden-sharing at a time when Russian expansion is full
blown,]{.underline}" Engel added. ["That sends a message to Russia that
we're thrashing our allies and not going to be willing to work in tandem
with them and the NATO alliance."]{.underline} [Engel also repeated his
support for **sending Ukraine defensive weaponry**,]{.underline} which
could make Putin reconsider engaging in aggression "If Putin starts
seeing Russian soldier fatalities, that changes his equation," Engel
said. Spain and Germany on Monday joined European Union calls on Russia
to release Ukrainian sailors and ships, while U.S. Ambassador Nikki
Haley --- during a United Nations Security Council meeting Monday ---
called on Russia to "immediately cease its unlawful conduct" in the
Black Sea. Russia, meanwhile, called Ukraine's actions "dangerous" and
said the three Ukrainian vessels illegally crossed into Russian waters.
[Senate Armed Services Committee chairman Jim Inhofe]{.underline},
R-Okla., threatened new sanctions on Russia, and [called for a
coordinated response between the U.S. and its European
allies.]{.underline} "If Putin continues his Black Sea bullying, [the
United States]{.underline} and Europe [must consider]{.underline}
imposing additional sanctions on Russia, inserting a greater U.S. and
NATO presence in the Black Sea region and [increasing military
assistance for Ukraine]{.underline}, as called for in the \[2018 defense
policy law\]," Inhofe said in a statement Monday. [Congress
authorized]{.underline} the government to provide Ukraine with [air
defense and coastal defense radars, naval mine and countermine
capabilities, and littoral-zone and coastal defense vessels]{.underline}
as part of the 2018 defense policy bill. That legislation was a response
to Ukraine losing two-thirds of its naval fleet, which mostly was based
in Sevastopol when Russia annexed Crimea. Ukraine has approximately 71
combat aircraft --- older Su-27s and MiG-29s, according to the "Military
Balance 2018" of the International Institute for Strategic Studies ---
and no modern air defense system it might have used to contest Russian
actions over the Kerch strait. Its navy is less equipped --- one
frigate, 10 other surface combatants --- and in no shape to challenge
Russian dominance of Kerch. "A new Russian use of force may not compel
Trump to respond, but it could energize Congressional efforts to
outflank him with additional Russian sanctions," Byron Callan, a defense
sector analyst for Capital Alpha Partners, said in a note to investors.
"There is not much time left in the lame duck session of Congress, but
these efforts could gain new life in January-February." [The U.S. and
Ukraine were in "close discussion" for Washington to supply another
tranche of lethal weapons for Kiev's fight in eastern
Ukraine]{.underline}, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin told
reporters Nov. 18, a day after Klimko met with U.S. Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo in Washington. [The Senate Foreign Relations Committee's
ranking member, Bob Menendez]{.underline}, D-N.J., in a statement on
Monday [urged Trump to commit to strong actions]{.underline} before the
president meets with Putin at the G20 summit this week. "Once again, the
Kremlin has shown that it only respects a strong adversary that is
willing to stand up to bullies," Menendez said. [Menendez called
for]{.underline} tougher sanctions, additional NATO exercises on the
Black Sea and for the U.S. to send [more security aid to Ukraine,
"including **lethal maritime equipment and weapons.**"]{.underline}
Menendez also warned the president against a repeat of his display at
the U.S.-Russia summit in July, where Trump embraced Putin's assertion
that Russia did not interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,
over the analysis of U.S. intelligence agencies and his national
security advisers. "At this precarious time, the U.S. cannot afford a
weak performance by President Trump at the G20, like we saw in Helsinki.
Mr. President this is your opportunity to finally show American
leadership in defense of our principles and our close allies across
Europe," Menendez said. Congress, Menendez added, should pass the
bipartisan "Defending American Security from Kremlin Aggression Act,"
sponsored earlier this year by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. The bill adds
measures to strengthen NATO and fight cybercrime, as well as new Russia
sanctions on "persons that facilitate illicit and corrupt activities,
directly or indirectly, on behalf of Vladimir Putin." In a tweet on
Monday, the [Republican co-chairman of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, Sen.
Rob Portman]{.underline}, of Ohio, [condemned Russia's "unprovoked and
unwarranted aggression" against the Ukrainian navy]{.underline} in the
Azov Sea. He also called the blocking of the ships "an unlawful, hostile
action" and said the U.S. \"should join the international community in
condemning it." [Portman credited the administration for **authorizing
the use of lethal aid**]{.underline} and facilitating the transfer of
two excess Coast Guard patrol boats to the Ukrainian navy. "That being
said, [we]{.underline} can, and [should look to do more for the
Ukrainians with]{.underline} both [lethal]{.underline} and non-lethal
[aid]{.underline}," Portman said in a separate statement on Monday. \"We
need to help the Ukrainian people to not only build their military
capabilities, but also strengthen their democratic institutions. I will
continue to take every opportunity to find ways to help Ukraine ---
legislatively and otherwise. [They are a valued ally who need and
deserve our continued support.]{.underline}" The ranking member of the
House Armed Services Committee's sea power subpanel, Rep. Joe Courtney,
D-Conn., called on the United Nations to "sanction this outrage."
Courtney expressed support for the Ukrainian navy's right to pass
through the Kerch Strait, as governed by international law and bilateral
agreements --- "not arbitrary Russian diktats 'closing' access to
Ukrainian territorial waters."

The U.S[. Senate\'s version of the annual authorization for American

[Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio]{.underline}, who [authored the
Ukraine aid amendment]{.underline}, said the bill contains language that
aims to limit U.S.-Russian cooperation until Russia frees 24 Ukrainian
sailors captured in international waters of the Kerch Strait off Crimea
last November. \"[The legislation \... demonstrates our commitment to
stand with the people of Ukraine and the international community in
calling for the release of the illegally detained sailors who were fired
on and captured by Russian forces in international waters on November
25, 2018,\" Portman, who **co-chairs the Senate Ukraine Caucus**, said
Thursday on the chamber floor.]{.underline} Portman said the language of
his amendment makes the sailors\' release \"a condition for the U.S.

international law,\"]{.underline} he said, [referring to the Kerch
attack and Russia\'s 2014 annexation of Crimea,]{.underline} the first
forcible seizure of territory in Europe since World War II. The
annexation triggered war in Ukraine\'s east and multiple rounds of U.S.-
and EU-led sanctions that have since wreaked havoc on Russia\'s economy.

### New NAFTA or No NAFTA

#### It\'s not a bluff

**Kirby 18** -- Jen, "Trump has threatened to withdraw from NAFTA.
What's next?," Vox,
<https://www.vox.com/2018/12/4/18123809/usmca-trump-nafta-withdrawal-congress>

President Donald [Trump]{.underline} says he['s]{.underline} finally
[going to]{.underline} do what he's long threatened: [tear up
NAFTA]{.underline}. Trump's warning came as he left the G20 meeting in
Buenos Aires, Argentina, this weekend. There, Trump, along with former
Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau, signed the replacement for NAFTA --- called the United
States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement, or USMCA, as Trump has rebranded it
stateside. "I'll be terminating it [within a relatively short period of
time]{.underline}," Trump said Saturday of the original NAFTA. "We get
rid of NAFTA. It's been a disaster for the United States." Trump's
threat is intended for Congress --- especially Democrats, who have
objected to elements of the renegotiated trilateral trade pact with
Mexico and Canada. The House of Representatives and the Senate must
approve the USMCA, and both parties have voiced reservations. Democrats
don't think it does enough to protect American jobs and workers, and
some Republicans see the new deal as too protectionist. [[The withdrawal
threat is a Trumpian ultimatum]{.mark}: [Take my trade deal, or there's
no deal at all. **Trump loathes NAFTA**]{.mark}]{.underline}. He has
called it the "worst trade deal ever signed." He has threatened to tear
up the trade pact in the past, but was ultimately persuaded to
renegotiate the agreement, leading to the USMCA. Trump has touted the
USMCA as a historic trade deal, even though it's really an updated and
revised version of NAFTA --- which itself is a nearly 25-year-old
agreement negotiated by George H.W. Bush. So Trump got a new deal and
declared victory. And now [**[he's wielding NAFTA as a political
cudgel]{.underline}**. **[The president's threat is
serious]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[,]{.underline}** but it faces a few
potential pitfalls. Trump can likely unilaterally pull out of NAFTA, but
Congress has a lot more power on trade than on other international
agreements, and experts say lawmakers could find ways to protect NAFTA
or limit Trump on trade in other ways.

#### Passage promotes stability, even if Trump doesn't follow through on the threat

**Ponnuru 12-13**-2018 -- Ramesh, Ponnuru: Why Congress can't cave in to
Trump on NAFTA, SLC Tribune, America's News

[The best argument for Congress to pass]{.underline} President Donald
Trump\'s [tweaked]{.underline} version of the [North American Free Trade
Agreement is]{.underline} also the worst argument for it. It\'s the
argument from [stability]{.underline}. It concedes that the new
agreement, labeled the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), may not be
a vast improvement over NAFTA, or an improvement at all. But it urges
passage on the ground that [otherwise we might end up with no trade
agreement at all,]{.underline} because Trump has been threatening to
withdraw from NAFTA. This is the argument that the editors of the
Washington Post are making. They have no illusions about the USMCA. They
know that NAFTA was not \"the worst trade deal ever,\" as Trump calls
it. Studies have found that the agreement, which first went into effect
in 1994, modestly increased American GDP without raising unemployment or
significantly reducing manufacturing wages. The Post editors are aware,
as well, that the changes in the new agreement are a mixed bag. (If
NAFTA were a disaster, as Trump says, USMCA would be, too.) On the plus
side, American exporters get more access to the Canadian dairy market,
and the agreement includes new rules on digital trade and storage. On
the other hand, the agreement also has stricter rules on what counts as
a car made within the trade bloc and new wage rules for the Mexican auto
industry. Both of these policies were priorities of the Trump
administration and are, as the editors note with understatement,
\"possibly counterproductive.\" The Post\'s argument for congressional
passage of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement is not that on balance it\'s
better than NAFTA. It\'s that [[passage]{.underline}]{.mark} \"**[[would
stabilize a hemispheric trade area that]{.mark} Mr. [Trump had
threatened to destabilize]{.mark}]{.underline}**.\" Trump is threatening
to withdraw from NAFTA so as to leave lawmakers a choice between his
version of the deal and no deal at all. [[With no
deal]{.mark},]{.underline} the [[more restrictive trade rules that
applied before Nafta would go back into effect]{.mark}. The Post is
right to prefer either NAFTA or USMCA to that result]{.underline}.

## Economy !

### 1nc

#### NAFTA 2 is key to the economy \-\-- withdrawal collapses it

**Winters 18** -- senior policy fellow for Americans For Prosperity
(Alison, "Whether it's NAFTA or USMCA, Americans are better off when
trade barriers are lifted," The Hill,
<https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/412804-whether-its-nafta-or-usmca-americans-are-better-off-when-trade>)

When it took effect in 1994, the North American Free Trade Agreement
([NAFTA]{.underline}) [created the largest trading market in the
world]{.underline}. NAFTA lifted tariffs on the majority of goods
produced and traded by the U.S., Canada and Mexico. At that time, the
three signatories had a combined 365 million people and GDP totaling \$6
trillion. Today, NAFTA encompasses a market of 500 million people with a
combined GDP of \$25 trillion. NAFTA has been a boon for U.S. producers
and consumers. Canada and Mexico are our number one and two export
markets, respectively, as we exported almost \$500 billion worth of
goods to them in 2016. And of the 14 million American jobs supported by
trade with Mexico and Canada, 5 million are a direct result of NAFTA. It
is vital to our prosperity to continue that strong trade relationship.
But [while NAFTA has been an overall success, the agreement needs to be
modernized for]{.underline} the 21st century to reflect new
developments, such as the advent of [digital trade, e-commerce and
communications]{.underline}. The Trump administration renegotiated
NAFTA's successor, the United States--Mexico--Canada Agreement
([USMCA]{.underline}), which [was a step in that direction]{.underline}.
As trade policy junkies pore over the details to mixed reviews, one
thing is certain: the new deal isn't perfect, but it's far better than
no NAFTA at all. [USMCA includes]{.underline} new, largely [positive,
chapters on digital trade, e-commerce, and finance]{.underline}.
Modernization -- check. It also makes very modest improvements on some
points of contention by lowering barriers to certain dairy markets in
Canada and lowering U.S. barriers to sugar and peanuts. Lowering
additional trade barriers -- check. But there are problematic new
elements in this deal, including stricter country-of-origin
requirements, which increase trade barriers. Not so good. Perhaps more
troubling are the new minimum wage standards for Mexican auto workers,
which will be massively complicated to comply with. These kinds of
protectionist policies drive up costs for everyone. Including domestic
policies in free trade agreements may be a slippery slope for other
trading partners to make unacceptable demands on U.S. policy. But
upending today's strong North American trading relationships [and
returning to pre-NAFTA days would be a perilous path]{.underline}. Given
the central role NAFTA has played in strengthening our economy and
improving lives in all three countries, it's important not to undermine
its obvious benefits as the new agreement undergoes approval and
implementation. There are two areas that pose specific concerns. First,
[[the administration must keep the U.S. firmly in
NAFTA]{.underline}]{.mark} until the new deal is fully ratified and
implemented. [[Failure]{.mark} to do so [could unleash]{.mark} [**real
and unnecessary damage** on the]{.mark} American
[economy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Terminating NAFTA before a new deal is in
place would reduce market access for businesses throughout North
America, causing unnecessary pain for thousands of businesses and their
workers. One study for the Business Roundtable estimated that
[terminating NAFTA would shrink the U.S. economy by up to 1.2 percent
annually and reduce]{.underline} net [employment by as many as 3.6
million jobs]{.underline}, [while imposing higher prices on working
families]{.underline}. [[Threats]{.mark} to pull out of NAFTA
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} only [[creating **unnecessary uncertainty**
for businesse]{.mark}s]{.underline} whose time would be better spent
preparing for changes under USMCA. Second, U.S. tariffs on Canadian and
Mexican steel and aluminum should be eliminated immediately,
irrespective of any update to NAFTA, as should U.S. tariffs on Canadian
soft wood lumber. Moreover, the administration should drop its 232
investigation for new tariffs -- autos and auto parts hardly constitute
a national security threat. Every day, newspapers are filled with
stories of how American workers, businesses, farmers and consumers are
bearing the costs of these tariffs. There is little evidence to show
that the tariffs enhanced the United States' bargaining position during
the USMCA talks, despite claims to the contrary. If anything, the new
agreement occurred in spite of the tariffs. And without the tariffs,
American workers and companies would have been spared unnecessary harm.
The administration is now planning to negotiate respective trade
agreements with Japan, the European Union and the United Kingdom. This
is a welcome step. But leaving metal, lumber, and auto tariffs in place
or in play may give negotiators understandable pause and make them less
willing to lower barriers and open markets. It is time to chart a new
course, one based on cooperation, not confrontation. The administration
deserves credit for cutting taxes and removing regulatory barriers,
which has resulted in a strong economy and the lowest unemployment rate
in nearly 50 years. [[Dropping tariffs and keeping NAFTA]{.mark} firmly

#### Economic decline causes war.

[The]{.underline} United States' [motivation for]{.underline} building
[the postwar economic system was]{.underline} [as much **preventing
conflict** as]{.underline} promoting [growth.]{.underline} In setting
out the rules by which all members would conduct business, the
architects of the system hoped to separate economic from military
competition. U.S. withdrawal need not result in economic or physical
wars, but it will raise the risk of stumbling into conflict by accident.
[Without]{.underline} agreed-on [rules, even minor economic disputes
have the potential to set off **escalating
counterattacks**]{.underline}. If the norm of separation between
economic and military confrontations breaks down, **[economic
frictions]{.underline}**, such as Chinese theft of intellectual property
or restrictions on trade with a nuclear Iran or North Korea, [could turn
into **outright conflict**]{.underline}. It is plausible that [as the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates retreats and thereby [weakens
its economy]{.underline}, the [Trump]{.underline} administration [will
**blame**]{.underline} the [economic damage]{.underline} not on its own
actions but [on foreign governments, creating a **self-perpetuating
cycle of anger**. When]{.underline} other major [countries step forward
to preserve the]{.underline} open economic [order, or defend
themselves]{.underline} against U.S. economic aggression, [Washington
may **interpret that as an attack** on U.S. primacy]{.underline}. The
[Trump]{.underline} administration [might]{.underline} even
[misinterpret the]{.underline} current [forbearance by China or the EU
as a **sign of weakness** and an **invitation to escalate**]{.underline}
confrontations.

### Impact I/L -- Economy 

#### USMCA necessary to maintain economic momentum -- delay hurts nearly every sector of the economy

**Wenstrup, 7/5**---American politician, U.S. Army Reserve officer, and
Doctor of Podiatric Medicine, who has been the U.S. Representative for
Ohio\'s 2nd congressional district since 2013. (Brad, "Rep. Brad

After years of stagnation and slow recovery, our economy is roaring. The
unemployment rate is at a 50-year low, average wages are rising and
Americans are keeping more money in their pockets thanks to tax relief.
But this [**economic momentum for American families is at risk if
Congress continues to delay** consideration of **the U**nited
**S**tates-**M**exico-**C**anada **A**greement. **Trade with Mexico and
Canada supports 12 million jobs in the United States.**]{.underline}
Here in Ohio, trade with Mexico and Canada supports 428,400 jobs. [We
can support these workers and add more jobs to the American economy by
updating our trade agreement.]{.underline} [The time is long
overdue]{.underline} to usher in a new trade agreement with our North
American neighbors. [American businesses and workers have been forced to
operate under a 20th century trade deal unfit for our 21st century
economy. The current North American trade agreement was created long
before the dominance of internet commerce.]{.underline} Consumer
behavior looks a lot different today than it did 25 years ago when our
current trade agreement was established. [We now live in a world where
people can find and purchase products from across the world in seconds
using a device in their pocket. Innovation has forced us to change the
way we do business, but **our current trade agreement has not kept up
with the pace of innovation**]{.underline} In the fall, the United
States, Canada and Mexico reached an agreement to modernize and improve
our North American trade agreement. Earlier this week, the Mexican
Senate voted overwhelmingly to ratify the USMCA. Now the ball is in our
court. [It's time for the United States Congress to act. Delaying
consideration of USMCA tells our trading partners that we're not serious
about doing business with them.]{.underline} This is the wrong message
to send. In addition, [delays in considering USMCA delay important
provisions that will create jobs and grow the economy. Make no mistake,
**delay hurts each and every American.** The USMCA modernizes our
regional trade framework by establishing rules of the road for digital
trade, setting the global standard on digital market access. USMCA
addresses the technological landscape that has developed in the past 25
years. It also ensures that companies of all sizes and in all sectors of
our economy can compete by **prohibiting forced data localization**.
This new agreement also includes important provisions to ensure American
innovators are able to sell products to Canada and Mexico, while
protecting them from intellectual property theft.]{.underline} With
USMCA, America will retain its place as the global leader in the digital
economy. The [USMCA would level the playing field for American farmers
and manufacturers, making it easier to sell "made in America" products
in our neighboring countries. **Expanded markets** for American
businesses would create and support more jobs in the United
States.]{.underline} In 2018, Canada and Mexico were the top two markets
for Ohio exports. Combined, they were worth \$27.9 billion, more than
half of the total value of exports from Ohio. The approval of, or
failure to approve, the USMCA would have enormous implications for our
Buckeye economy and the millions of Americans whose jobs rely on trade
with Canada and Mexico. In 2017, 88 percent of iron and steel, 80
percent of rubber and 75 percent of motor vehicle parts produced in Ohio
were exported to Mexico and Canada, according to the Business
Roundtable. In order to keep shifts scheduled and workers employed, the
businesses producing these products in America need certainty that they
will continue to have markets in Canada and Mexico to sell their
products. In addition to manufacturing, Ohio farmers depend on trade.
Ohio is the 12th-largest agricultural exporting state. Ohio boasts
75,000 farms; 90 percent are family-owned. The USMCA will level the
playing field for these families by reducing the use of unfair
trade-distorting policies. It also will open new opportunities for
farmers to sell poultry and dairy products in Canada for the first time.
The USMCA would provide farmers with much-needed certainty as they seek
to grow. However, [none of this can happen if Congress does not act.
American innovators, workers and farmers depend on trade. The USMCA
offers the opportunity to rebalance North American trade and create more
jobs, higher wages and better opportunities for American
families.]{.underline} No more delays. It's time to pass the USMCA.

#### USMCA is key to the economy -- trade boosts multiple critical sectors

**Cox 19** \-\-- Phil Cox, cochair of the Trade Works for America
Coalition and a former executive director of the Republican Governors
Association, (\"Opinion: Trump\'s trade deal with Canada and Mexico is a
huge win for Americans, and it\'s time for Congress to pass it,\"

[Free trade is at the heart of the US economy]{.underline}. Each year,
our companies sell more than \$2.5 trillion worth of goods and services
to customers around the world. [Of]{.underline} those
[exports]{.underline}, [nearly \$300 billion worth of exports go to
Mexico and another \$360 billion]{.underline} worth [go to
Canada]{.underline}, **[two key markets]{.underline}** for US
enterprise. The importance of these markets is the reason the US entered
into a trade agreement with our North American neighbors 25 years ago
and why President Donald Trump and his administration signed a new deal,
a better deal --- the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA.
And now [it\'s time for Congress to reaffirm **how important trade**
with **Mexico** and **Canada** is **for the US economy**]{.underline}
and pass the USMCA. Our country recognizes the importance of these
markets. A quarter of a century ago, the US entered into a trade
agreement with our North American neighbors that helped to level the
playing field and reduce barriers to trade for American job creators.
But 25 years later, that trade agreement is no longer the best agreement
for US businesses. That\'s why Trump and his administration signed the
USMCA. As it goes in Washington, there are lawmakers on both sides of
the aisle who are not 100% pleased with the agreement. To me, that means
the Trump administration negotiated a balanced agreement that deserves
support from all members of Congress. The USMCA updates the old
agreement and ensures that American workers and families are put first.
[This is also a welcome agreement for industries that depend on free,
fair, rules-based trade with Canada and Mexico]{.underline}. America\'s
**[farmers]{.underline}**, **[ranchers]{.underline}**, **[auto
manufacturers]{.underline}**, [and **small businesses** are **set to
gain**]{.underline} once the USMCA is signed into law. [According to
the]{.underline} US **[I]{.underline}**nternational
**[T]{.underline}**rade **[C]{.underline}**ommission, [the USMCA will
create **176,000** US **jobs** and **add** over **\$68 billion** to the
**US economy**]{.underline} --- that is, in addition to the 12 million
jobs already in the US that are supported by trade with Canada and
Mexico. [This]{.underline} positive [report]{.underline} [suggests that
pro-growth policies promoting free, fair, and enforceable trade are a
win for American workers and job creators alike]{.underline}. Supporters
of the USMCA recognize that [this agreement contains provisions that
will help make American job creators **more competitive**]{.underline}.
[For **agriculture**]{.underline}, those [provisions provide increased
access to Canadian]{.underline} dairy [markets]{.underline}. [For
**manufacturing**, the USMCA establishes requirements that promote
American-made **cars** and **machinery**]{.underline} [as well as **new
worker protections**]{.underline} [to ensure American factory jobs do
not get **shipped overseas**]{.underline}. The economic boost comes from
a number of provisions in the USMCA that will help American businesses
and consumers, including increased access to Canadian dairy markets for
farmers and requirements that promote American-made cars and machinery
for manufacturers. [The USMCA also established new rules around
e-commerce]{.underline}, [making it easier for American small businesses
to connect and sell to customers in Mexico and Canada]{.underline}. The
USMCA is [also a winning proposition for]{.underline} American
[innovators because it strengthens **i**ntellectual-**p**roperty
**protections**]{.underline}, alleviating worries about a competitor
gaining access to their trade secrets.

#### USMCA key to the economy -- IP protections

**KERINS 6/12** (Raymond F., Jr.; chairman of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce\'s Global Innovation Policy Center, "Mexico tariffs averted,
USMCA back in bullseye,"

Congress will soon decide whether to ratify the [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates-[M]{.underline}exico-[C]{.underline}anada
[A]{.underline}greement, the trade deal that would update NAFTA in
several ways. Most importantly, the new pact [would significantly
strengthen intellectual property rights]{.underline}. [It\'s hard to
overstate the value of IP rights to America\'s economy]{.underline}. The
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office reports that [IP-intensive industries
account for 45.5 million U.S. jobs and more than \$6 trillion in
GDP]{.underline}. [Without strong IP rights, the industries that enhance
our lives would cease to function]{.underline}. [Congress can set the
stage for years of job creation and economic growth by
ratifying]{.underline} the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement
([USMCA]{.underline}). [Innovation isn\'t cheap or easy]{.underline}.
This is especially true in my industry of biopharmaceuticals. It costs
an average of \$2.6 billion and often takes more than a decade to
develop just one new medicine. By patenting their drug designs,
biopharmaceutical firms can prevent rivals from creating knockoff
medicines for a limited time. That enables innovative firms to earn a
return on investment and plow the revenues into new lines of research,
leading to yet more innovation. Today, [the biopharmaceutical sector
supports 4.7 million American jobs and contributes more than \$1.3
trillion a year to the economy \-- none of which would be possible
without our nation\'s strong IP protections]{.underline}. [Other
IP-intensive sectors have similarly impressive statistics]{.underline}.
[Copyright industries support 5.7 million jobs, while the tech industry
employs 6.7 million]{.underline}. Importantly, [these creative
industries produce the majority of American exports, which help reduce
the trade deficit]{.underline}. [These sectors account for about \$840
billion in merchandise exports and another \$80 billion in service
exports annually]{.underline}. [The USMCA contains numerous intellectual
property provisions]{.underline}. For instance, the deal would create a
Committee on Intellectual Property Rights. Representatives from each
country would work together to boost enforcement of IP rights and
improve transparency in issues concerning trade secrets. That\'s a
[necessary]{.underline} reform [to prevent IP theft]{.underline}. By one
estimate, [the sale of counterfeit American goods costs our economy \$29
billion a year. Stolen trade secrets, meanwhile, cost businesses and
workers \$180 billion]{.underline}. The USMCA also includes critical
protections for sophisticated drugs known as \"biologics,\" which
represent some of the most promising cures of the future. [Policies like
these will preserve the incentive for American individuals and companies
to innovate and protect them from IP theft]{.underline}. American,
Canadian, and Mexican leaders already finalized the terms of the USMCA
back in November, but Congress hasn\'t yet approved the deal. There\'s
little reason to wait. [The USMCA would give the nation\'s most
innovative and creative industries the security they need to create jobs
and grow our economy]{.underline}. Passing it is a no-brainer.

[Certainty. An early vote for USMCA will provide U.S. businesses from
**every sector**]{.underline}---[from **agriculture** to
**manufacturing** and **services**]{.underline}---[**the certainty**
that their exports to Canada and Mexico will enter those markets
duty-free. This **certainty is invaluable** because **these** two
**markets** are **invaluable to American business.**]{.underline} [U.S.

and Powered growth in U.S. services exports from \$27 billion in 1993 to
\$91 billion in 2017. [Certainty is what American job-creators require
if they are to make brick-and-mortar investments and create more jobs
for the long haul.]{.underline} Growth. USMCA isn't just about holding
on to what you've got. [USMCA will **boost economic growth** by
**improving the market access** guaranteed for U.S.
businesses.]{.underline} For example, the agreement further opens the
Canadian market to U.S. agricultural exports such as dairy products,
poultry, and wine. [U.S. farmers and ranchers have faced five years of
declining commodity prices,]{.underline} [so USMCA's improved market
access is more than welcome]{.underline}. And [make no mistake: **These
are growth markets**]{.underline}. [U.S. exports]{.underline} to Mexico
and Canada [have grown more over the past decade than sales to any other
country]{.underline}. In each case, exports have expanded by more than
\$100 billion annually. **[No other market comes close]{.underline}**.
In fact, Mexico and Canada accounted for about 40% of the growth in U.S.
goods exports in dollar terms over the past decade. In particular, USMCA
promises growth for America's small and midsized exporters. Canada and
Mexico are the top two export destinations for U.S. small and
medium-size enterprises, more than 120,000 of which sell their goods and
services in our two North American neighbors. [When an American small
business starts exporting, it's almost always to Canada or
Mexico.]{.underline}

#### Ratifying USMCA is the only way to preserve the growth from NAFTA

//JSL

[The new]{.underline} U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement
([USMCA]{.underline}) [preserves economic advances wrought since NAFTA
came into effect in 1994]{.underline}. [It introduces needed
modernization, strengthens labor provisions and provides at least 16
years of established rules, enabling the private sectors of each country
to plan and invest for the future in a fiercely competitive global
marketplace.]{.underline} Combined, Canada and Mexico are the United
States\' largest economic partners. [Roughly 14 million U.S. jobs are
supported by NAFTA trade]{.underline}, which totals some \$1.3 trillion
a year. That is over 80 percent more than China-U.S. trade.
Approximately 50 percent of that trade is in intermediate goods: The
three countries are joint producers instead of merely traders. This
underscores, for example, why threats to close the U.S.-Mexico border
would be a serious blow to U.S. businesses, farms and the 5 million U.S.
jobs supported by commerce with Mexico. The Mexico-U.S. relationship has
undergone a major transformation. Bilateral trade is six times its size
before NAFTA existed, reaching \$616 billion in 2017. That is more than
\$1 million a minute. [From a trade perspective]{.underline}, however,
[NAFTA needed to be modernized]{.underline}. Formal renegotiation began
in August 2017, and leaders signed the USMCA agreement in November 2018.
Modernization was relatively easy. Supporters highlight [important
updates in: digital trade; intellectual property protection;
science-based agricultural standards; regulatory cooperation; financial
services; customs; treatment of state-owned enterprises;
competition/antitrust investigations; and enforcement provisions. USMCA
incorporates deeper labor and environment commitments and stronger
enforcement provisions for them.]{.underline} Three controversial
negotiating areas were "rules of origin" for the automotive sector,
mechanisms for settling disputes and the process for review and possible
termination of the agreement. Experts worry that the new vehicle rules
of origin could make auto production less competitive, increase prices
and cost jobs. A new IMF study reinforces those worries. Vehicle "rules
of origin" specify the characteristics that vehicles must have to be
traded in North America without paying tariffs. USMCA increases the
percentage of required North American content to 75 percent, of which
40-45 percent must now come from locations that pay at least \$16 per
hour. There is also a new requirement to use steel and aluminum produced
in the region. The U.S. administration argues that this deal, combined
with stronger commitments in the labor chapter, is a big win for U.S.
workers, which creates strong new incentives for automakers to
manufacture in the U.S. U.S. labor unions and congressional Democrats
are skeptical, however, asking whether the new agreement and its
enforcement provisions will really bring better labor practices in
Mexico and a fairer playing field. U.S. unions raised their concerns in
a March 26 House Ways and Means committee hearing. USMCA supporters
contend that the labor chapter and commitments by Mexico should satisfy
the concerns being raised. Mexico's new government is committed to
significant labor-sector reforms and has introduced robust reform
legislation, which should pass by the end of April. Even if the
legislation is good, some will question the United States\' ability to
enforce USMCA commitments by Mexico. The provisions for solving disputes
between foreign investors and national governments were also
controversial. U. S. negotiators wanted to eliminate that system. U.S.
industries argued that they needed the protections. [Negotiators
compromised: U.S. investments in energy, infrastructure and
telecommunications in Mexico will remain covered by dispute settlement
provisions.]{.underline} Controversy surrounded the rules governing when
and how the agreement could be ended. The negotiators agreed to give
USMCA a minimum life of 16 years. In the sixth year, the three
governments will meet to review USMCA. If all agree, they could extend
the agreement for another 16 years, or any of the governments can
request annual reviews in subsequent years. Before approving USMCA,
Mexico and Canada is seeking removal of the current U.S. tariffs on
their steel and aluminum exports. The new IMF study finds big benefits
for all three economies if these tariffs are removed. Congress awaits a
report on USMCA's economic impact from the U.S. International Trade
Commission, which is expected in mid-April. The Trump administration
then needs to propose implementation legislation for Congress to
consider. Supporters hope Congress will approve USMCA this year before
the approaching U.S. elections make that impossible. U.S. Trade
Representative Robert Lighthizer told Congress on Feb. 27 that not
approving USMCA would mean the U.S. has "no trade program" and that it
"can't do trade deals," sending damaging messages to China and others.
President Trump and Lighthizer have begun meetings to build support for
USMCA. Congressional Democrats, however, may hesitate to bring the deal
to a vote before the 2020 elections. President Trump previously
threatened to withdraw from NAFTA to force congressional action. That
would be a high-risk path. Congressional Democrats would likely bring a
legal challenge against the president's right to act unilaterally.
[Various studies project very serious costs of pulling out of NAFTA,
with potential job losses estimated to range from 1.4 to 4 million for
the United States]{.underline}, 1.5 to 10 million for Mexico and 0.5
million to 1.2 million for Canada. Contrary to conventional wisdom,
there is broad public support for NAFTA. The Chicago Council on Global
Affairs finds that since 2008 there was more than a 20-percent increase
in positive American views towards NAFTA. In early 2019, 70 percent of
U.S. respondents agreed that the new USMCA would be good for the U.S.
economy. [Given the]{.underline} **[enormous economic
benefits]{.underline}** [of sustaining North America's commercial
networks, Congress, the Trump administration and the non-governmental
stakeholders should make every effort to find an approach that addresses
key concerns raised, approves USMCA and produces a mutual "win" for the
three countries this year.]{.underline}

#### Key to the economy\-\--digital trade.

**Holding 19** \-\-- George Holding, represents North Carolina's 2nd
District. Mr. Holding serves on the Ways and Means Subcommittees on
Trade and Health, (\"Delay of new trade deal harms America\'s digital

accessed 6-16-2019)

Today, nearly six out of 10 American jobs created by exports of digital
services are jobs outside the tech industry. Sectors like agriculture,
health care, and manufacturing make up a large part of the 5 million
total jobs and \$1.35 trillion in annual productivity of the digital
economy, according to the Internet Association. As a result, it [is now
more important than ever to ensure the **rules of the road** on the
**digital highway** are modernized and clear.]{.underline} [That's
why]{.underline} [President
[Trump]{.underline}](https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump) and U.S.
Trade Ambassador [Robert
Lighthizer](https://thehill.com/people/robert-bob-lighthizer) [spent
countless hours negotiating the creation]{.underline} of a new "digital
chapter" in [the]{.underline} updated proposed trade agreement with
Mexico and Canada -- the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement
([USMCA]{.underline}). [The USMCA includes a host of new benefits
for]{.underline} American workers, families, and [the
economy.]{.underline} And [the changes impacting the **digital economy**
are among the most important.]{.underline} [It will, for the **first
time**, prohibit the imposition of customs duties]{.underline}, fees, or
other charges on [**digital products** traded
electronically]{.underline}. [It will also safeguard **cross-border data
flows**]{.underline}. [USMCA is the first trade agreement to ensure the
**free flow of data for all sectors**.]{.underline} Businesses of all
sizes, across [all sectors]{.underline}, [**will benefit**
from]{.underline} the free and [safe flow of information. The trade pact
**prohibits data localization** requirements]{.underline} that force
businesses to use or locate computing facilities in a specific country
or territory as a condition for conducting business. Additionally,
[USMCA streamlines customs processes to **support
e-commerce**]{.underline}. As the digital economy continues to evolve
and grow, modernizing the mechanics of how goods flow between countries
in North America is critical. [The new agreement will help **speed the
growth** of **e-commerce.**]{.underline} Finally, [as this sector
continues to evolve and expand, enhanced data protection becomes even
more important.]{.underline} The proposed agreement encourages, for the
first time, data privacy and cybersecurity collaboration. USMCA requires
all three countries to adopt measures to comply with each other's data
privacy laws. USMCA also promotes a collaborative, risk-based approach
and adoption of industry best practices to keep networks and services
secure. These new digital provisions and protections are both timely and
important. A lot has changed in the 25 years since NAFTA was signed into
law. Back then, folks didn't have cell phones, internet access required
a dial-up connection, and movies had to be rented in VHS format. Today,
we live in an interconnected world driven by rapidly evolving digital
technologies and capabilities. We do our work on lightning-fast
computers, interact through mobile phones, and buy goods with a single
click. [These changes have benefited workers and consumers across every
sector.]{.underline} It has created [**countless jobs** and **grown
wages**]{.underline}, all while improving Americans' day-to-day lives.
It has made it easier for farmers to find customers, [leading to
**increased revenue** and **production**]{.underline}. It has overhauled
logistics entirely, empowering manufacturers across the country to be
able to expand and grow, and it is even forcing health care providers to
adapt to new standards. Imagine the potential if [we can make our
digital economy even more competitive on a global scale]{.underline} --
making our products more affordable while simultaneously [expanding
markets for our local job creators.]{.underline} **[That is what USMCA
sets out to achieve]{.underline}**. And that's why the agreement's new
digital provisions are so important. Yet, unfortunately, USMCA is
currently being held hostage by the partisan political circus in
Washington. Delaying approval of the trade pact hits the pocketbooks of
the workers and families in North Carolina and across the nation. Folks
across all sectors -- from farmers and factory floor workers to
programmers and engineers -- are losing out. Far too much hangs in the
balance. USMCA will lead to more jobs, larger paychecks, and cheaper
prices for American consumers. It provides a much-needed foundation for
the expansion of free and fair digital trade and investment in
innovative products and services. And it creates a framework for a
cutting edge, 21st-century economy. It's time for Washington to buck up
and get this agreement over the finish line. We have before us [a once
in a generation opportunity to define a **new global standard** in
**digital trade**]{.underline}, one that [positions the United States as
the **world leader** in the **digital economy**.]{.underline} We can't
afford to let it slip away.

[If the U.S. economy tanks]{.underline}, should we [expect]{.underline}
Donald [**Trump** to engage in a **diversionary war**]{.underline}?
Since the age of Machiavelli, [analysts]{.underline} have [expected
world leaders to launch international conflicts to deflect popular
attention away from problems at home]{.underline}. [By stirring up
feelings of patriotism, leaders might escape the political costs
o]{.underline}f scandal, unpopularity --- or [a poorly performing
economy]{.underline}. One often-cited example of diversionary war in
modern times is [Argentina's]{.underline} 19[82]{.underline} [invasion
of the Falklands]{.underline}, which several (though not all) [political
scientists attribute to the junta's desire to divert]{.underline} the
people's [attention from a disastrous economy]{.underline}. In a 2014
article, Jonathan Keller and I argued that whether [U.S. presidents
engage in diversionary conflicts depends in part on their psychological
traits]{.underline} --- how they frame the world, process information
and develop plans of action. [Certain traits **predispose** leaders to
more **belligerent** behavior]{.underline}. Do words translate into
foreign policy action? One way to identify these traits is content
analyses of leaders' rhetoric. The more leaders use certain types of
verbal constructs, the more likely they are to possess traits that lead
them to use military force. For one, [conceptually simplistic leaders
view the world in "black and white" terms; they develop unsophisticated
solutions to problems and are largely insensitive to risks]{.underline}.
Similarly, distrustful leaders tend to exaggerate threats and rely on
aggression to deal with threats. [Distrustful leaders typically favor
military action and are confident in their ability to wield it
effectively]{.underline}. [Thus, when faced with]{.underline}
politically damaging problems that are hard to solve --- such as [a
faltering economy]{.underline} --- [leaders who are both distrustful and
simplistic are less likely to put together complex, direct
responses]{.underline}. [Instead, they develop **simplistic but risky
"solutions"** that divert popular attention from the problem,
utilizing]{.underline} the tools with which they are most comfortable
and confident (**[military force]{.underline}**). Based on our analysis
of the rhetoric of previous U.S. presidents, we found that presidents
whose language appeared more simplistic and distrustful, such as Harry
Truman, Dwight Eisenhower and George W. Bush, were more likely to use
force abroad in times of rising inflation and unemployment. By contrast,
John F. Kennedy and Bill Clinton, whose rhetoric pegged them as more
complex and trusting, were less likely to do so. What about Donald
Trump? Since Donald Trump's election, many commentators have expressed
concern about how he will react to new challenges and whether he might
make quick recourse to military action. For example, the Guardian's
George Monbiot has argued that political realities will stymie Trump's
agenda, especially his promises regarding the economy. Then, rather than
risk disappointing his base, [Trump might try to rally public opinion to
his side via military action]{.underline}. [I sampled Trump's campaign
rhetoric, **analyzing 71,446 words** **across 24 events**]{.underline}
from January 2015 to December 2016. Using a program for measuring
leadership traits in rhetoric, [I estimated what Trump's words may tell
us about his level of distrust and conceptual complexity]{.underline}.
The graph below shows Trump's level of distrust compared to previous
presidents. [These results are startling]{.underline}. [Nearly 35
percent of Trump's references to outside groups paint them as harmful to
himself, his allies and friends, and causes that are important to
him]{.underline} --- a percentage almost twice the previous high. The
data suggest that Americans have elected [a leader who]{.underline}, if
his campaign rhetoric is any indication, [will be **historically
unparalleled among modern presidents** in his active suspicion of those
unlike himself and his inner circle, and those who disagree with his
goals]{.underline}. As a candidate, Trump also scored second-lowest
among presidents in conceptual complexity. Compared to earlier
presidents, he used more words and phrases that indicate less
willingness to see multiple dimensions or ambiguities in the
decision-making environment. These include words and phrases like
"absolutely," "greatest" and "without a doubt." A possible implication
for military action I took these data on Trump and plugged them into the
statistical model that we developed to predict major uses of force by
the United States from 1953 to 2000. For a president of average distrust
and conceptual complexity, an economic downturn only weakly predicts an
increase in the use of force. But [the **model** would predict that a
president with Trump]{.underline}'s [numbers would respond to **even** a
**minor** economic **downturn** with an increase in the use of
**force**]{.underline}. For example, were the misery index (aggregate
inflation and unemployment) equal to 12 --- about where it stood in
October 2011 --- [the model predicts a president with Trump's
psychological traits would initiate more than one major conflict per
quarter]{.underline}.

[America's status as the world's most vital nation is as **dependent on
its prosperity** as it is on its military might]{.underline} and ability
to project power worldwide. [The federal **government's capacity** to
allocate resources to our armed forces, the **private sector's** ability
to develop beneficial products and technologies, and the satisfaction of
the]{.underline} domestic [public are all **closely tied** to the
continued growth of American wealth]{.underline} at home and abroad.
[This has been proven repeatedly during periods where the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates has [faced its greatest
**existential threats**: Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan were unable to
keep up with the]{.underline} sheer industrial [output of the American
heartland, while the Soviet Empire lost control of its
satellites]{.underline} in great part [due to their desire to benefit
from the Western free market system]{.underline}.¶ Therefore, [the
formulation of a **long-term strategy** that anticipates the potential
disruptions and opportunities of the new global economy is as important
as questions of diplomacy and military strategy]{.underline}. As
[the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates evaluates
how it will face the rapidly changing and increasingly interconnected
world of the 21st century, it [**must** take into account its **economic
interests** as well as the potential economic costs associated with
achieving its political objectives]{.underline}.¶ Since the beginning of
the Cold War, [America's **unparalleled** ability to influence countries
through nonviolent means has been **critical** to the **preservation of
global stability**]{.underline}. The most relevant example of this in
our history is the Marshall Plan, which leveraged American capital to
provide a devastated post-War Europe with almost 120 billion dollars
(adjusted for inflation) in aid. This aid was critical to preventing the
spread of Soviet influence into Western Europe, and laid the foundation
for an economically strong region stretching from Portugal to Austria
that has been free from inter-state conflict since 1945. [Because of the
pragmatic exercise of economic influence, the]{.underline}
[E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion [is now our strongest ally as
well as our largest trading partner]{.underline}.¶ Worldwide, the
liberal economic system that the United States has promoted through
international trade organizations like the WTO has contributed to
unprecedented economic cohesion between states. When countries are tied
together in the mutually beneficial exchange of goods, the opportunity
cost of war goes up significantly, making political leaders much more
likely to de-escalate and rely on nonviolent means to resolve
conflicts.¶ [Our **economy** also plays a **key role** in helping the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates **[deal with states that
threaten stability]{.underline}**. [The American **ability to impose
sanctions** has been a **formidable tool** for discouraging **nuclear
prolif**eration and punishing violators of international
norms]{.underline}. [When more direct means of coercion are required, a
powerful industrial and technological base **enables** the maintenance
of a well-funded and technologically **advanced
military**]{.underline}.¶ [America's advanced 17 trillion-dollar economy
has allowed it to exert the influence that it does in the world
today]{.underline}. [However, our **economic strength** and the skill of
our workforce, which have always underwritten our international
influence, **should not be taken for granted**]{.underline}. [**Rapid
growth in the developing world** means that **American companies** and
workers must now contend in an **increasingly crowded global
marketplace**]{.underline}. In the new "knowledge economy," educating
America's workers and [ensuring that the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[retains its role as an innovation capital
must take the highest priority]{.underline}**. On the business side,
reforming America's institutions and [removing barriers to expansion and
innovation will encourage the companies of the future to make their
start here]{.underline}.

#### Economic dominance prevents global nuclear war.

the Hoover Institution, Post-American World Order, 23 March 2017,

[The emergent world, divided]{.underline} between the United States,
China, and Russia, [points to the new global order. Particularly
worrisome are]{.underline} the [warming relations between Beijing and
Moscow]{.underline}, despite Chinese designs on Siberian lands and
resources. Overcoming a centuries-old rivalry, the recent Sino-Russian
rapprochement compounds Washington's difficulties. Separating Russia
from China, as Kissinger and Nixon did, would be a sensible goal for
President Trump. It has always been a wise recourse to divide one's
adversaries. Besides, the United States and Russia have worked together
in the past. During the World War II, they collaborated against the
Third Reich. And during the Cold War, they cooperated in nuclear arms
treaties and wheat deals, while mutually trying to skirt [a
**flashpoint**]{.underline} that [could end in a **nuclear war**.
Washington can work to steer]{.underline} the Kremlin, as it has done
before, [toward acceptable conduct]{.underline} with its neighbors
before Russia can be more than a tactical ally in the great game with
China. In the immediate future, the United States can adopt
international and domestic approaches to cope with Russian and Chinese
territorial expansionism. The [**tensions stoked by the assertive
regimes** in the Kremlin or Tiananmen Square could **spark a political
or military incident** that might **set off a chain reaction leading to
a large-scale war**]{.underline}. Historically, powerful rivalries
nearly always lead to at least skirmishes, if not a full-blown war. The
anomalous Cold War era spared the United States and Soviet Russia [a
direct conflict]{.underline}, largely from concerns [that]{.underline}
one [would trigger a **nuclear exchange destroying**]{.underline} both
states and much of **[the world]{.underline}**. Such a repetition might
reoccur in the unfolding three-cornered geopolitical world[. It seems
safe to acknowledge that an ascendant China and a resurgent Russia
**will persist** in their geo-strategic ambitions.]{.underline} What Is
To Be Done? The first marching order is to dodge any kind of perpetual
war of the sort that George Orwell outlined in "1984," which engulfed
the three super states of Eastasia, Eurasia, and Oceania, and made
possible the totalitarian Big Brother regime. A long-running Cold
War-type confrontation would almost certainly take another form than the
one that ran from 1945 until the downfall of the Soviet Union. [What
prescriptions can be offered in the face of the **escalating
competition** among the three global powers?]{.underline} First, **[by
staying militarily and economically strong, the United States will have
the resources to deter its peers' hawkish behavior that might otherwise
trigger a major conflict]{.underline}**. Judging by the history of the
Cold War, the coming strategic chess match with Russia and China will
prove tense and demanding---[since all the countries boast nuclear
arms]{.underline} and long-range ballistic missiles. Next, the United
States should widen and sustain willing coalitions of partners,
something at which America excels, and at which China and Russia fail
conspicuously. [There can be **little room for error**]{.underline} [in
fraught crises]{.underline} among nuclear-weaponized and hostile powers.
[Short- and long-term standoffs are likely]{.underline}, as they were
during the Cold War. [Thus, the playbook]{.underline}, in part,
[involves a waiting game in which each power looks to its rivals to
suffer **grievous internal problems** which could **entail a collapse,
as happened to the Soviet Union**]{.underline}. [Some Chinese and
Russian experts]{.underline} predict grave domestic problems for each
other. They also [entertain **similar thoughts about the United
States**]{.underline}, [which they view as terminally
decadent]{.underline} and catastrophically polarized over politics,
ethnicity, and the future direction of the country. [So, the brewing
three-way struggle also involves a **systemic contest**]{.underline},
[which will test the competitors']{.underline}
**[economic]{.underline}** and political **[institutions]{.underline}**.
[At this juncture, the world is entering a **standoff**]{.underline}
[among the three great and several not-so-great powers. **Averting
war**]{.underline}, while defending our interests, [will prove a
challenge, calling for]{.underline} deft policy, political endurance,
and **[economic growth]{.underline}**, [as well as **sufficient military
force to keep at bay aggressive states or prevail over them if ever a
war breaks out.**]{.underline}

#### Global nuclear war.

**Tønnesson 15**---Research Professor at the Peace Research Institute
Oslo; Leader of East Asia Peace program, Uppsala University \[Stein,
"Deterrence, interdependence and Sino--US peace," International Area
Studies Review, 2015, Vol. 18, No. 3, p. 297-311\]

Several [recent works]{.underline} on China and Sino--US relations [have
made]{.underline} substantial [contributions to the current
understanding of how and under what circumstances]{.underline} a
combination of [nuclear deterrence and economic interdependence may
reduce the risk of war between major powers]{.underline}. At least four
conclusions can be drawn from the review above: first, those who say
that [interdependence may **both inhibit and drive
conflict**]{.underline} are right. [Interdependence raises the cost of
conflict]{.underline} for all sides [but]{.underline} [asymmetrical or
unbalanced dependencies and **negative trade expectations**]{.underline}
may [generate tensions leading to trade wars among inter-dependent
states that]{.underline} in turn [increase the **risk of military
conflict**]{.underline} (Copeland, 2015: 1, 14, 437; Roach, 2014). The
risk may increase if one of the interdependent countries is governed by
an inward-looking socio-economic coalition (Solingen, 2015); second, the
risk of war between China and the US should not just be analysed
bilaterally but include their allies and partners. Third party countries
could drag China or the US into confrontation; third, in this context:
it is of some comfort that the three main economic powers in Northeast
Asia (China, Japan and South Korea) are all deeply integrated
economically through production networks within a global system of trade
and finance (Ravenhill, 2014; Yoshimatsu, 2014: 576); and fourth,
[decisions for war]{.underline} and peace [are taken by very few people,
who act on the basis of their **future expectations**]{.underline}.
International relations theory must be supplemented by foreign policy
analysis in order to assess the value attributed by national
decision-makers to economic development and their assessments of risks
and opportunities. [If leaders]{.underline} on either side of the
Atlantic [begin to seriously **fear or anticipate their own nation's
decline**]{.underline} then [they may blame]{.underline} this on
[external dependence, appeal to anti-foreign sentiments, contemplate the
use of force to gain]{.underline} respect or [credibility, adopt
protectionist policies, and]{.underline} ultimately **[refuse to be
deterred by]{.underline}** either [**nuclear arms** or prospects of
socioeconomic calamities. Such a dangerous shift could happen
**abruptly**]{.underline}, i.e. under the instigation of actions by a
third party -- or against a third party. Yet as long as there is both
nuclear deterrence and interdependence, the tensions [in East
Asia]{.underline} are unlikely to escalate to war. As Chan (2013) says,
all states in the region are aware that they cannot count on support
from either China or the US if they make provocative moves. [The
greatest risk is **not**]{.underline} that **[a territorial
dispute]{.underline}** leads to war under present circumstances [but
that **changes in the world economy** alter those circumstances in ways
that render inter-state peace more precarious]{.underline}. If China and
the US fail to rebalance their financial and trading relations (Roach,
2014) then a trade war could result, interrupting transnational
production networks, provoking social distress, and exacerbating
nationalist emotions. [This could have unforeseen consequences in the
field of security, with nuclear deterrence remaining the only factor to
**protect the world from Armageddon**, and **unreliably
so**]{.underline}. [Deterrence could **lose its
credibility**]{.underline}: one of the two [great powers might gamble
that the other yield in a cyber-war or conventional]{.underline} limited
[war]{.underline}, or third party countries might engage in conflict
with each other, with a view to obliging Washington or Beijing to
intervene.

AS)

At a press conference last month, House Speaker Nancy [Pelosi expressed
cautious optimism about]{.underline} the United States-Mexico-Canada
Agreement ([USMCA]{.underline}), [which is set to replace the
quarter-century-old North American Free Trade Agreement.]{.underline}
\"I have always thought that this was probably one of the easier trade
agreements to come to agreement on, but so far we\'re not there yet,\"
she said. [For the sake of the American energy industry, lawmakers
should get \"there\" soon. By ratifying USMCA, the United States will
spur economic growth and **bolster our booming domestic energy sector**
for years to come.]{.underline} It\'s time for Congress to put partisan
hangups aside and pass the deal as quickly as possible. [USMCA retains
key provisions from NAFTA that have helped **sustain North American
energy trade**. The new agreement will keep oil and gas products like
gasoline tariff-free. It will also reduce tariffs on thinning materials
that help crude oil pass through U.S.-Canadian pipelines.
USMCA]{.underline} maintains an important legal provision for U.S. oil
and gas firms operating in Mexico. The investor/state dispute settlement
[allows companies to sue governments that impose harmful regulations.
This would be **crucial for American firms** if Mexico attempts to
nationalize its energy industry and expel foreign companies as it did in
1938. Such protection is crucial to continuing the vast flow of
energy]{.underline} between North American nations. According to the
Congressional Research Service, [petroleum products made up between 10
and 17 percent of total North American trade over the past decade. More
than 80 refineries across America process imported crude oil from Canada
or Mexico for domestic use.]{.underline} In addition to providing us
with the energy we need, [Canada and Mexico are some of our best energy
customers.]{.underline} In 2016, energy exports to Mexico exceeded
imports by a two-to-one margin. Mexico is now the biggest market for
U.S. natural gas exports, and the fourth largest market for exported oil
and gas equipment. In fact, [American petroleum and natural gas exports
to our southern neighbor exceeded \$20 billion in 2017]{.underline} \--
more than double that of a decade ago. And [that figure is expected to
rise]{.underline}. Mexican demand for natural gas will likely jump more
than 26 percent by 2031, according to Mexico\'s Secretariat of Energy.
[Canada\'s demand for American energy is also growing]{.underline}.
Canadian imports of U.S. crude oil increased more than a hundredfold
between 1993 and 2017. Most of that growth has come in the last decade.
[Passing USMCA would benefit countless Americans. The oil and natural
gas industry supports over 10 million U.S. jobs and accounts for nearly
8 percent of the nation\'s economy. [USMCA will also continue to reduce
our dependence on oil from hostile foreign
countries]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rather than import oil from the Middle
East to supplement domestic energy production, we can turn to our
friendly neighbors to the north and south. In 2017, we imported more oil
from Mexico than Iraq.

#### It's [new NAFTA]{.underline} or [no NAFTA]{.underline}

**Rodriguez 3-4**-2019 -- Sabrina, "Neal: New NAFTA will have 'very
hard' path through Congress," *Politico*,
<https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/04/richard-neal-new-nafta-congress-1232254>

House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal will play a decisive role in
getting Congress to approve President Donald Trump\'s new North American
trade pact. As of now, he predicts it won't be an easy sell for the
Trump administration. "Look, it's going to be very hard to do this,"
Neal said in an interview with POLITICO. Several Democratic and GOP
lawmakers alike have already said they are unhappy with parts of how the
U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement is written, making it increasingly clear
that a tough road lies ahead for getting the deal through both chambers
of Congress. Neal, who leads the powerful House committee responsible
for trade issues, emphasized that he hasn't made up his mind about
USMCA, which the three countries renegotiated last year to take the
place of NAFTA. For his part, Neal stressed that it was too early to
know what it will take for Democrats to support the deal. Congress has
not yet seen the draft bill text of USMCA that they would have to
approve, he noted. But the Massachusetts Democrat offered an early look
at his road map for vetting the deal that Trump has lauded as a \"truly
groundbreaking achievement.\" "[[There seem to be]{.mark} at the moment
[three path]{.mark}s here and that is: a [new NAFTA]{.mark}; a [status
quo NAFTA]{.mark} if nothing happens; [and]{.mark} then [a third]{.mark}
option, [where the president]{.mark} has said he'll [take us out of
NAFTA]{.mark}]{.underline}," Neal said. "**[[I don't think there's
anyone that thinks the status quo \[with the original NAFTA\] is
appropriate]{.underline}]{.mark}**," he said. "So, if you leap to the
next manifestation, it's 'How do you satisfy the critics that you really
have [improved]{.underline} the [trade pact?]{.underline}' And I think
that['s]{.underline} [going to require a lot of effort]{.underline} on
the U.S. trade representative's part." That means U.S. Trade
Representative Robert Lighthizer will have to make a strong sell on the
merits of the new agreement, Neal said. Some House Democrats have
already said they won't vote for the agreement unless the administration
addresses their concerns about how the pact's labor and environmental
standards will be enforced. Others are seeking less-stringent
prescription drug pricing provisions. Asked whether he thinks
renegotiation would be necessary, he said: \"I don't know yet. We really
haven't had anything yet to wrap our arms around.\" Neal\'s response
walks back comments he made last week that indicated he was not in favor
of reopening the agreement. He said then that there would be \"ample
opportunity\" for lawmakers to discuss the deal once a copy of the bill
text is sent to Congress for their review. Neal said the key issue he's
looking at is "enforcement, enforcement, enforcement." He also said
another \"consideration\" is Democrats' concerns that the new deal could
lock in higher prices for a costly class of drugs that have shown
promise in treating cancer and other serious illnesses. Several
lawmakers have told POLITICO that the U.S. trade chief has become more
engaged with lawmakers in recent months, often taking their calls to
listen to specific concerns. Neal\'s chairmanship could bode well for
building the necessary support for congressional approval of USMCA. He
is known for his ability to work across the aisle as a deal-maker, which
could be critical to helping House Speaker Nancy Pelosi deliver the
necessary Democratic votes if party leaders decide to back the deal.

#### USMCA key to [economic]{.underline} and [innovative]{.underline} leadership\-\--otherwise China outcompetes.

David A. **Gantz, 11-15**-2018 - Will Clayton fellow in international
economics at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy and the
Samuel M. Fegtly professor of law at the University of Arizona's James
E. Rogers College of Law; \"US needs USMCA if it\'s serious about
competing with China,\" TheHill,
https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/416739-us-needs-usmca-if-its-serious-about-competing-with-china

The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement ([USMCA]{.underline})
negotiated by the Trump administration [to replace]{.underline} the
North American Free Trade Agreement ([NAFTA]{.underline}) [is to be
signed by the three countries\' presidents Nov. 29. This complex
agreement]{.underline}, which makes major changes in rules governing
automotive trade, dispute settlements and agriculture, while adding or
expanding coverage of such areas as labor rights, environmental
protection, small and medium-sized enterprises, state-owned enterprises,
corruption and e-commerce, [cannot go into force until it is approved
through the applicable constitutional procedures in each member state.
Approval by the Canadian Parliament and Mexican Congress **seems
assured**]{.underline}. [Yet, questions arise as to when and if the U.S.
Congress will approve]{.underline}. [[For]{.underline}]{.mark} many
reasons, including the preservation of North America as a world leader
in **[[manufacturing]{.mark} efficiency]{.underline}**, **[[job
growth]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}** [as well as maintaining **strong
economic**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[political
relations]{.underline}** [with Canada and Mexico]{.underline}, [[it is
**imperative**]{.underline} [for]{.underline}]{.mark} [Congress to
approve [USMCA]{.mark} as soon as possibl]{.underline}e. However,
because a Democratic majority will control the House of Representatives
as of January, enactment of USMCA-approval legislation is less assured
there than in the Senate, where Republicans will maintain their
majority. Under Trade Promotion Authority legislation, the
administration must submit a list of required changes to U.S. law, a
Statement of Administrative Action setting out the nature of the
legislative changes required and a U.S. International Trade Commission
study of the economic effects, all before the agreement can be formally
submitted to Congress, hopefully by mid-March 2019. TPA mandates action
by Congress within 90 legislative days after submission. Congress can
vote only for or against the agreement; no amendment is possible. The
prospects for eventual congressional approval of TPA may not be dimmed
by Democrats\' control of the House, but House consideration of USMCA
could be delayed because of more pressing items on the Democratic
agenda: Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, immigration and health
care, for example. Also, Democrats in the House may demand changes in
the text, most likely to strengthen the labor and environmental
provisions (which are already considerably more robust than those in the
NAFTA "side" agreements), as a condition of supporting the agreement.
Major support for USMCA in the House can be expected from the 200
Republican members, but even if most of them support the agreement, the
administration will need 25 to 30 Democrat votes to reach the 218-vote
majority required for passage. USMCA may attract more votes from
Democrats than has historically been the case for trade agreements. New
automotive rules are expected to create jobs in the U.S., while stronger
labor provisions protecting independent unions in Mexico will likely be
supported by some Democrats because they should result in wage increases
in Mexico and reduce the wage disparity with the U.S. Also, Democrats
who have opposed the inclusion of investor-state dispute settlement in
past trade agreements may welcome its elimination entirely with Canada
and significant narrowing with Mexico. It is possible that Democrats
will take a totally obstructionist position on all Trump administration
initiatives. However, prior to November, current House Minority Leader
Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), the likely Speaker of the House come January,
indicated that Democrats would be looking for areas where they could
cooperate with the Republicans. USMCA approval could well be one of
those areas, even if most Democratic House members decide to oppose it.
While some Republicans might have opposed the president's will if Canada
had been excluded, [given extensive U.S. bilateral trade with Canada and
the **critical importance** of Canadian manufacturers in supply chains
for U.S. manufactured goods]{.underline}, that problem has disappeared.
Also, while business groups have expressed dissatisfaction with USMCA's
investment and government procurement provisions, [it can be expected
that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and many other organizations will
**pressure** both Republicans and Democrats in Congress **to support**
USMCA]{.underline}. Thus, there is still a reasonable possibility that
the USMCA could take effect as soon as Jan. 1, 2020. [[If the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is]{.mark} **seriously
[interested]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in]{.underline} **[competing with
China]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[for]{.mark} world [leadership in]{.mark}
**[innovation]{.mark}**,]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} in [maintaining a
robust]{.mark} North American **[manufacturing]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline} **[export base]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [[the
administration]{.mark} and Congress [must]{.mark} work together to
[enact USMCA]{.mark} as [promptly]{.mark} as possible]{.underline}.

University's Space Policy Institute (Cody, 3/7/17, "On the Nature of
Science and Technology Power,"

Indeed, the **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates' [[leadership in science and
tech]{.mark}nology [has been a]{.mark}]{.underline} historical
[[**cornerstone** of]{.mark} its capacity for "[hard power"]{.mark}
force application and projection [and]{.mark} [economic and
societal]{.mark} ["soft power]{.mark}]{.underline}." It buttresses the
country's economic might, enables the modern standards of living of our
citizenry, and expands our global cultural and normative reach.\[ii\]
Equally so, [the power of science and technology has been decisive
in]{.underline} the context of [national security]{.underline}. As
President Truman noted in 1945, while urging Congress to create a
Department of National Defense, "[no aspect of military preparedness is
more important than scientific research]{.underline}."\[iii\]
[Through]{.underline} discoveries, [technological
innovation]{.underline}, and the capacity to develop ideas into
deployable weapons, systems, and concepts, [the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [has arrived at its modern-day military
advantage and superiority]{.underline}.\[iv\] To that end, [science and
technology may be considered key elements of the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tate[**s'** comprehensive national power]{.underline}
-- [fundamentals of the country's strength vis-à-vis
competitors]{.underline}. Yet science and technology alone cannot ensure
any country's continued security, prosperity, or hegemony; [far from
operating in a vacuum, **s**cience and **t**echnology are **constantly
evolving**]{.underline} to address changing domestic and international
circumstances and threats. [[To reap advantage]{.mark} from science and
technology]{.underline}, especially in their national security
application, [[a country must **continually innovate**]{.mark} to tackle
contemporary developments and anticipate future ones]{.underline}. This
poses a considerable challenge, the solution to which extends beyond
advanced engineering and research. To explore these notions, this essay,
particularly interested in the application of science and technology
toward national security ends, examines the United States' recent
employment of security-related technologies. From this, it explores the
attributes of science and technology power and the similarities and
differences between science and technology power and other forms of
national power such as the economic and diplomatic. Looking at the
relative importance of science and technology in the United States today
and likely significance in the coming future, it lays out a series of
policy recommendations that may guide policymakers as they make
decisions that impact the direction of the country's scientific and
technological course. Employment of -- and Challenges Facing -- National
Security-Related Technolog Recognizing the vital role that technology
played in winning World War Two, along with the emerging threat of
Soviet technological competitiveness, the United States established in
the war's wake an extensive infrastructure to support national security
science and technology efforts. This provided foundation and catalyst
for the development of military capabilities and tools needed to meet
the challenges of the Cold War and the modern day: the nuclear triad,
intelligence-gathering and cyber infrastructure, space-based radar and
communications systems, advanced precision-guided munitions, and
integrated command and control, along with myriad other assets.\[v\]
These technologies have seen extensive use in contemporary military
conflicts. The wars in the Balkans and the Gulf saw the ever-increasing
use of position, navigation, and timing assets such as GPS to provide
precise and reliable information to the warfighter and direct
precision-guided weaponry.\[vi\] Targeted airstrikes and weapons such as
the long-range cruise missile have allowed for far more rapid,
responsive, and accurate strikes than those of the past while
substantially reducing collateral damage. Combat drones and unmanned
aerial vehicles, innovations emblematic of the "War on Terror," enable
the warfighter to engage adversaries and conduct reconnaissance while
safely remaining away from the front lines of the battlefield. Stealth
aircraft, using a range of advanced technologies that reduce reflections
and emissions, have helped pilots conduct sorties while evading
detection.\[vii\] [[Tech]{.mark}nology [abets]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates' [[security]{.mark}
beyond warfighting]{.underline}. [[Advanced **cyber
capabilities**]{.underline}]{.mark} -- encryption, for example -- seek
to [[defend]{.mark} the networks which control the country's power,
transit, and water [infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline} from malicious
hacks and crippling denial of service.\[viii\] [[Tech]{.mark}nologies
[capable of detecting]{.mark} **harmful [bio]{.mark}logical and chemical
[agents]{.mark}** [guard]{.mark}]{.underline} the country
[[against]{.mark} potentially [devastating attack by non-state
actors]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[ix\] Increasingly sophisticated monitoring
and [surveillance technology enables the government to globally track
and work to counter]{.underline} criminal activity, [terrorist
organizations]{.underline}, and other developments which threaten the
country's safety.\[x\] Crucially, though, the United States'
contemporary application of national security systems has also
demonstrated the inherent challenges of innovation and the limitations
of technology. Despite advanced military hardware, principally designed
to fight large-scale conventional wars against Cold War-era foes, the
United States military had to "catch up" and react to unconventional
tactics, such as roadside bombs and sniper attacks, employed against it
in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Though decidedly outnumbered and
outgunned, enemy combatants effectively countered the United States'
asymmetric technological advantage through guerilla warfare, propaganda,
and exploiting collateral damage that advanced weapons systems created
-- doctrines which the United States' technology did not anticipate and
was unprepared or unsuited to counter.\[xi\] Likewise, despite the
sophistication of the United States' homeland security technologies, the
government has struggled to prevent incidents of domestic terrorism such
as mass shootings, often characterized by the use of simple,
off-the-shelf equipment.\[xii\] Meanwhile, [in reaction to]{.underline}
the **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates' present-day
[technological superiority,]{.underline} [**[competitive foreign
powers]{.mark}** such as Russia and China [are]{.mark} heavily
[investing]{.mark} in hardware and capabilities]{.underline} in the
cyber and military realms specifically designed [[to counter]{.mark} the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tate[**s'**
[tech]{.mark}nological [strengths]{.mark}]{.underline} and exploit its
demonstrated vulnerabilities. The technological capabilities underlying
the United States' comparative military advantage are now proliferating
to an increasing number of state and non-state actors, including
potential adversaries, leveling the military "playing field."\[xiii\]
The Attributes of National Security Science and Technology Power From
this, several key attributes and characteristics of science and
technology as a form of national power can be identified. [Foremost is
the capacity for [technology and science]{.mark} to be a]{.underline}
significant, occasionally [**decisive**, [enhance]{.mark}r of [a
country's military strength]{.mark} against enemies]{.underline}.
[Countries which develop innovative military technologies]{.underline}
which effectively counter an adversary's offenses or defensives, or
against which an adversary has no means to protect itself, [find
themselves disproportionately advantaged on the
battlefield]{.underline}. Indeed, technologies which upend dominant
"status quo" warfighting paradigms -- such as, historically, the
introduction of the chariot, the tank, or nuclear weapons -- are poised
to significantly disrupt and reorder the geopolitical and military
balance of power.\[xiv\] To that end, science and technology power,
particularly in the national security sphere, is developed and sustained
through the adaption to, and more so through the anticipation of,
revolutionary changes in military affairs, doctrine, and hardware. As
Lieutenant Colonel Scott Stephenson noted in the influential "The
Revolution in Military Affairs," "those slow to adapt to military
revolutions... are likely to suffer painful results. When the pace of
change accelerates, the militaries that anticipate and adapt are likely
to gain a massive advantage over potential enemies who are less
agile."\[xv\] That agility is, in large part, borne from innovations in
science and the development of new technologies which lead to
unanticipated, and therefore difficult to counter, doctrines. [A
defining characteristic of **s**cience and **t**echnology
power]{.underline}, then, [is the continual quest for states to match,
counter, and out-compete the technology of their adversaries.
This]{.underline} continuing [interplay between technology and national
power, characterized by the sustained technological evolution and
described]{.underline} often [as an "offset," has been a key focus for
national security-related research and development]{.underline}
throughout the Cold War and [into the present]{.underline}. The United
States' deployment of nuclear weapons, for example, offset the numerical
advantage held by the Soviet Union's land forces in the early Cold War.
Soviet parity in nuclear weapons catalyzed the development of guided
weapon and integrated command and control as a counter, focusing on
accuracy of targeted weapons systems independent of range.\[xvi\] The
United States' capacity to offset Soviet technology through innovative
developments -- and the Soviet bankruptcy borne from military
expenditure that came as a corollary -- was an important factor in
maintaining a generally peaceful stable of power along with the
country's ultimate triumph in the Cold War. In the present-day, China
and Russia's focus on countering the systems and technologies which
currently provide the United States' military asymmetry is emblematic of
this "offset" approach to science and technology power. Paradoxically,
however, national security-related technology in the present day has
become as great an equalizer as it has historically been a separator of
actors' strengths. Technological superiority in the present may provide
the United States' unrivaled military strength, especially against foes
(historically, state actors with large conventional forces) for which
its national security technologies anticipated countering. Yet as the
example of the Iraq and Afghani insurgencies amply demonstrated,
technological superiority coupled with innovation focused on addressing
hypothetical future battlefields may not be adequate to oppose or defeat
all actors or all forms of warfare, regardless of the level of their
sophistication. Indeed, advanced technologies may be entirely vulnerable
to actors utilizing doctrines with simple technologies that nonetheless
exploit their weaknesses, as was the case with sophisticated -- and
expensive -- American vehicles being destroyed by crude, homemade IEDs.
Technology itself also creates weaknesses; the United States'
progressing economic and social reliance upon interconnected networks,
for example, makes the country more vulnerable to potentially crippling
attack. Despite advanced American cybersecurity technologies and
techniques, non-state actors have still proven themselves capable of
infiltrating, attacking, and even denying use of American cyber
capabilities; considering recent trends, this vulnerable seems likely to
continue, if not worsen.\[xvii\] It may be that an attribute of science
and technology power, borne more from the focus and perceptions of the
technologists, theorists, and military leadership that employ it than
from science and technology itself, is that it obscures other factors
which equally dictate important developments in military, international,
and geopolitical affairs. Political upheaval, social change, and
economic development can change warfare dramatically, for example -- and
have nothing to do with "offset" strategies or war-room predictions of
possible enemies' future high-tech military hardware. As a product of
the military-industrial complex that emerged in the Cold War United
States to sustain continued technological development, Americans tend to
be acutely -- perhaps overly -- sensitive to technological innovation
among competitors and potential rivals. Fears during the Cold War and
contemporary discussions of the "Third Offset" paint pictures of
emerging, potential, and fanciful enemy weapon systems -- which military
planning and technology development was and is oriented toward
countering.\[xviii\] This fixation on solutions entailing engineering
and technological complexity blinds the national security technology
apparatus to external trends that could definitively impact the future
course of war -- such as the collapse of the Soviet Union leaving the
United States with a high-tech military and warfighting doctrine
unsuited for the military pressures and asymmetric nature of
counterinsurgency; the rise of radical terrorism with ideological
underpinnings that condone unconventional guerilla tactics such as
suicide bombings, which had great effect against high-tech targets; or
the continuing crisis where lone-wolf gunmen using off-the-shelf rifles
can commit massacres despite the government's highly complex and
pervasive surveillance and monitoring technology. Similarities and
Differences to Other Forms of National Power With these attributes in
mind, a comparison can be drawn between science and technology power and
other forms of power which constitute a country's comprehensive
strength, such as the economic and diplomatic. Regarding the economic,
science and technology power is similar in that the development of
science and technology is driven by the same forces as economic growth.
Like new economic products, services, and methods of operation,
[**s**cience and **t**echnology power relies upon the ingenuity of human
actors predicting and anticipating future trends]{.underline},
possibilities, and human behavior.
**[[Innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, iteration, [[and
**competitiveness** are fundamental]{.mark} catalysts for the continued
evolution and growth]{.underline} of both. The rapid proliferation and
subsequent use of innovative technologies across the world quickly
equalizes both the national security advantage and the economic
advantage they provided their inventor. Economic power, like national
security technology, is a key element of a country's warfighting
capability -- industrial might, strength in quality production, and
capable infrastructure are crucial facets of a country's ability to
mobilize and project force. A fundamental difference between economic
power and science and technology power, however, is competition. While
economies naturally compete, there is incentive for states to specialize
in the economic product or service most suited for it -- their
comparative advantage. [Competing economies are not actively
incentivized to counter the economic specialization of their rivals.
With science and technology power for national security]{.underline}
use, however, [states]{.underline} decidedly [hope to actively and
explicitly counter the relative advantage of their
adversaries]{.underline}. Like diplomatic power, [**s**cience and
**t**echnology has a "**soft power" element**; other states and their
societies may be influenced or compelled to action by the]{.underline}
might, [prestige, or cultural and technological hegemony of a
country]{.underline} in possession of highly advanced and capable
technologies.\[xix\] Diplomatic power occasionally experiences the same
issue of science and technology policy in being blinded to unpredicted
or external trends in the social, cultural, and economic spheres. The
power of diplomacy, for example, did not anticipate and struggled to
deal with the cultural, social, and political circumstances that led to
a breakdown of order in post-invasion Iraq; just as national security
technology was unprepared for the guerilla warfare of the Iraqi
insurgency. Diplomatic power and science and technology power differ,
though, in the fields of innovation and evolution. Whereas the military
regime is constantly evolving and occasionally being upended by
revolutions in security technology and associated doctrine, the
Westphalian diplomatic order has remained largely similar through
centuries -- even as it has grown gradually more complex and
interconnected. States do not tend seek to outcompete each other in the
diplomatic sphere through revolutionary new approaches to diplomacy;
negotiations, sanctions, deals, bi- and multilateral agreements, and the
like have remained consistent "doctrines" employed by states in their
dealings with international friends and foes. Science and Technology
Power's Present and Future Importance To return to Vannevar Bush's
assertion over half a century ago, science and technology is crucially
important for a states' economic growth and prosperity, the wellbeing of
its citizens, and national security. This remains absolutely the case
today. [Despite the challenges facing innovation]{.underline} in the
face of unanticipated adversaries and the proliferation of advanced,
equalizing technologies among adversarial states and non-state actors,
[science and technology provides the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates' **[unrivaled]{.underline}** levels of security
and **[military hegemony]{.underline}**. [[With]{.underline}]{.mark} the
appearance of **[[significant]{.mark} [global
challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- [refugee crises, environmental
degradation, the possible [emergence of a]{.mark}]{.underline} bi- or
[[**multi-polar world** characterized by]{.mark} states
with]{.underline} rough or equal **[[tech]{.mark}nological
[parity]{.mark}]{.underline}**, to name a few -- [the **future
importance of [science and technology]{.mark} power** [cut]{.mark}ting
[across all aspects of national]{.mark} [security]{.mark}
will]{.underline} undoubtedly [**redouble**. Science and technology and
its application as an element of]{.underline} the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates' [national power will
need to be directed to address these challenges]{.underline}. While the
exact characteristics that will define domestic and foreign national
security technologies of the future -- not to mention the economic and
social -- remain uncertain, [[the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[cannot afford to permit its current
tech]{.mark}nological [advantage]{.mark} [to slip]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Indeed, [as revision states such as China continue to develop their
technologies to]{.underline} directly [counter]{.underline} the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates' [capabilities, [it
will]{.mark}]{.underline} likely [[become]{.mark} an
**[imperative]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the country [[to]{.mark} **more
actively engage in and support**]{.underline} the
**[[develop]{.mark}ment of innovative [new]{.mark} security
[tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}** and doctrines --
[[lest]{.underline}]{.mark}, as history would suggest, [the
**[international order]{.mark} again [be upended]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### Prevents global nuclear war

The [[tensions stoked by]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[assertive
regimes]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Kremlin or Tiananmen Square [[could
**spark**]{.mark} **a political or military incident** that might set
off [a chain reaction leading to a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[large-scale
war]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Historically, powerful rivalries nearly
always lead to at least skirmishes, if not a full-blown war. [The
anomalous [Cold War]{.mark} era]{.underline}
**[[spared]{.underline}]{.mark}** the United States and Soviet Russia a
direct conflict, largely from concerns that one would trigger a
**[[nuclear exchange destroying]{.underline}]{.mark}** both states and
much of [**[the world]{.mark}**. Such a [repetition **might**
reoccur]{.mark} in the unfolding]{.underline} three-cornered
[geopolitical world]{.underline}. It seems safe to acknowledge that an
ascendant China and a resurgent Russia will persist in their
geo-strategic ambitions. What Is To Be Done? The first marching order is
to dodge any kind of perpetual war of the sort that George Orwell
outlined in "1984," which engulfed the three super states of Eastasia,
Eurasia, and Oceania, and made possible the totalitarian Big Brother
regime. A long-running Cold War-type confrontation would almost
certainly take another form than the one that ran from 1945 until the
downfall of the Soviet Union. What prescriptions can be offered in the
face of the escalating competition among the three global powers? First,
[[by **staying militarily and economically strong**, the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[will]{.mark}
have the resources to [deter]{.mark}]{.underline} its peers' hawkish
behavior that might otherwise trigger a **[[major
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Judging by the history of the Cold War,
[[the]{.mark} coming [strategic chess match]{.mark} with Russia and
China [will prove tense]{.mark} and
demanding]{.underline}---[[since]{.underline}
**[all]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the [countries boast nuclear
arms]{.mark}]{.underline}** and long-range ballistic missiles. Next, the
United States should widen and sustain willing coalitions of partners,
something at which America excels, and at which China and Russia fail
conspicuously. [[There can be **little**]{.mark} **room for
[error]{.mark}** in]{.underline} fraught **[crises [among
nuclear]{.mark}-weaponized]{.underline}** and **[[hostile
powers]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Short- and long-term standoffs are
likely, as they were during the Cold War. Thus, the playbook, in part,
involves a waiting game in which each power looks to its rivals to
suffer grievous internal problems which could entail a collapse, as
happened to the Soviet Union.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters this week that the pending
U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) would need to be reopened and
tweaked before the House will vote on it. This is bad news for America.

Mexico earlier this month made a monumental step forward in becoming the
first country to ratify the deal. With Canada not far behind, it is past
time for Pelosi to allow the USMCA to move forward in Congress. [Each
day the Speaker waits to act, America is missing out on innovation,
opportunity and increased job growth. According to the U.S.
International Trade Commission, **the USMCA will create 176,000 new jobs
and increase U.S. GDP by \$68 billion.** The modernized USMCA is
light-years ahead of the outdated NAFTA and it will create jobs, boost
wages, and open markets for American agriculture, manufacturing and
technology.]{.underline} NAFTA is so outdated that it doesn't even
reference the internet. [**[The USMCA is the framework for future
digital trade agreements and will unleash unprecedented American
innovation]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In addition to Kansas-grown wheat or
Wichita-produced aerospace components, [**[some of America's most
important exports also include our ideas.]{.mark}** Every day, farmers,
programmers, artists, doctors and entrepreneurs throughout our country
develop new technologies and products.]{.underline} This innovative
spirit is at the heart of America's ingenuity and we should do
everything we can to unleash it. [**[The USMCA will unlock creativity,
job growth and opportunity in our digital world and global economy. The
USMCA includes strong i]{.mark}**ntellectual **[p]{.mark}**roperty
**[provisions]{.mark}** that protect American patents, copyrights,
trademarks and trade secrets. **It also expedites the patent approval
process in Canada and Mexico, allowing America's innovative products to
be sold in those markets sooner** while protecting them from
theft.]{.underline} When NAFTA was negotiated in 1992, Motorola
cellphones were carried around in a bag and just 1 in 5 households had a
home computer. Even fewer than that could connect to dial-up internet in
order to access the World Wide Web, which was unveiled in 1991. Clearly
[a lot has changed in the last 30 years. Our laws and trade deals should
change as well.]{.underline} As NAFTA was negotiated before the dawn of
iPhones and Wi-Fi, [updating intellectual property standards are
critical. The USMCA meets the challenge of setting 21st century
standards to support and **protect American jobs and
innovation.**]{.underline} Thirty years ago, no one could have imagined
a drone delivering food to your doorstep within minutes of ordering it
online from your phone. In 30 more years, one can only guess what new
technology and innovation will be on the forefront. But one thing is
certain -- [by passing **[the USMCA]{.mark}**, we **[can make sure it's
American innovators and workers who are leading the
charge]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

### Impact I/L -- Innovation -- Small Business

#### USMCA is key to [small business]{.underline} \-\-- key to econ and innovation

**Kerrigan 19** -- president & CEO of the Small Business &
Entrepreneurship Council (Karen, "Why America\'s small businesses and
entrepreneurs win under USMCA," Fox Business,
<https://www.foxbusiness.com/small-business/americas-small-businesses-and-entrepreneurs-win-under-usmca>)

The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement ([USMCA]{.underline}) was
signed by President Trump and his fellow leaders at the G20 in
Argentina. The accord modernizes the decades-old NAFTA and [is chock
full of meaningful provisions that will help]{.underline} American
[small businesses]{.underline} boost exports and safeguard their
intellectual property (IP). [Small businesses drive the U.S.
economy]{.underline}, and they certainly dominate trade with Mexico and
Canada. [Thirty million small businesses]{.underline} employ more than
58 million American workers. They also [account for roughly half of U.S.
GDP]{.underline}. Many small businesses are looking to expand into
global markets, and agreements like the [USMCA will lower costs and
provide more certainty and opportunity]{.underline}. Many [small
businesses rely heavily on North American trade to stay
afloat]{.underline}. Of the U.S. companies that export to Canada and
Mexico, three in four have fewer than 50 employees, and four in five
have fewer than 100. [Modernizing NAFTA]{.underline} to strengthen IP
protections is an important achievement that [will provide a much-needed
boost to the U.S. economy. Small firms and startups invest heavily in
research and development]{.underline}. They produce 16 times more
patents per employee than larger businesses. [This innovation would
grind to a halt without]{.underline} patents, copyrights and other [IP
protections]{.underline}, which prevent rival firms from unfairly
replicating and undermining an innovator\'s creation. [Entrepreneurs
wouldn\'t invest in product development and **innovative ideas** - and
neither would outside investors - if rivals could steal the fruits of
such labor]{.underline}. The USMCA bolsters IP protections in several
ways. Consider copyrights, which prevent competitors from stealing
creative content like books, movies, music and art. These protections
are vital for countless small media and publishing firms. More than 80
percent of U.S. film and television companies have fewer than ten
employees. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP The USMCA would extend
Canada\'s copyright terms by 20 years, putting them on par with U.S.
standards. This change would give U.S. small business owners and their
families more time to benefit financially from their creations. The
USMCA also furthers the capabilities of research companies that develop
biologic medicines \-- drugs derived from living organisms. These firms
are set to receive ten years of \"regulatory data protection\" for their
biologics. During that time, no rival firm can use the innovators\' lab
or clinical trial data to create a knockoff treatment. The ten-year
standard represents a major improvement over Canada\'s and Mexico\'s
previous standards. Canada used to grant just eight years of data
protection. Mexico offered a maximum of five years of protection. The
new, stronger standard will spur additional research in the
biopharmaceutical industry, which directly employs more than 800,000
Americans and indirectly supports roughly 4 million other jobs. Big drug
companies depend on thousands of small vendors for help in producing
lifesaving treatments. Small entrepreneurial firms also dominate the
biopharmaceutical industry. Among pharmaceutical and medicine
manufacturing firms, 57 percent have less than 20 workers, and 79
percent have less than 100 employees. This critical industry is about
entrepreneurial businesses that innovate, compete with larger firms and
bring life-saving drugs to the market. [The USMCA would assist small
firms in other ways, to]{.underline}o. For instance, [it establishes a
committee to educate small and medium-sized businesses about ways to
expand their exports and reach new markets]{.underline}. This ensures
that America\'s businesses take advantage of every development
opportunity in the new deal. [The agreement further takes aim at costly
e-commerce trade barriers]{.underline}. Currently, just one in four
small businesses sells online \-- partly because it\'s expensive to do
so. But in this digital age, e-commerce is essential to business growth.
The USMCA makes it easier to sell online by raising the minimum cost of
shipments subject to taxes in Mexico and Canada. This allows companies
to ship a greater number of e-commerce goods tax-free. The deal also
prevents countries from imposing fees on goods and services traded
digitally. [The USMCA would **greatly benefit American small
businesses** and encourage new business creation in
America]{.underline}. Congress should waste no time in approving the
deal.

has all the skewness gone? The decline in high-growth (young) firms in
the U.S.", <http://econweb.umd.edu/~haltiwan/EER_DHJM.pdf>, Accessed
11/15/18)

[There is now **robust evidence**]{.underline}, [from multiple data
sources using a **variety of indicators**]{.underline}, [of a
**pervasive decline** in U.S. business dynamism over the last several
decades.]{.underline} We have added to the core facts about this decline
by focusing on the changing patterns of skewness in the firm growth rate
distribution. [We find that prior to 2000 the decline in the dispersion
of firm growth rates was accounted for by roughly equal declines in the
9050 and the 5010 differentials in firm growth rates]{.underline}.
However, since 2000 [the decline in dispersion has been driven primarily
by a decline in the 9050 differential.]{.underline} The decline in the
9050 has been so substantial that [skewness in the firm growth rate
distribution has largely been eliminated]{.underline}, both within the
major sectors of the economy and in the overall firm growth rate
distribution.

[Declining]{.underline} business [dynamism can be the outcome of
efficient responses to changing tastes]{.underline} and technology as
has been occurring in the retail sector. [However]{.underline}, the
[post-2000 decline]{.underline} in dynamism, [driven largely by smaller
contributions to job growth of young high-growth firms, **may be more
troubling**]{.underline}. [Evidence shows that high-growth young firms
have **disproportionately** accounted for **job creation** and
**productivity growth**]{.underline}. The [pattern]{.underline} for the
U.S. [used to be that]{.underline} in any given year, most [newly
entered firms would fail while a few would grow very fast]{.underline}.
These [high-growth young firms yielded substantial skewness in the firm
growth rate distribution]{.underline}. [Now the U.S. has a much lower
pace of startups]{.underline}, and those that do enter are less likely
to be high-growth firms. Thus, [startups and high-growth young firms
contributed less to U.S. job creation in the post-2000 period than in
prior periods]{.underline}. We do not yet fully understand the labor
market implications of a reduced role of young firms in job creation,
but the evidence highlights the importance of further research on the
topic.

[Aggregate productivity growth depends]{.underline} not only on
innovations and technology investments within firms but also [on the
economy\'s ability to reallocate resources from businesses with lower
productivity to businesses with higher productivity]{.underline}.
Evidence suggests that [young firms devote **disproportionately more
resources** to innovation]{.underline}, [so the high growth of young
firms is particularly important for aggregate productivity
growth]{.underline} (Acemoglu et al., 2013; Foster et al., 2001, 2006,
2008). [If rapid firm-level growth reflects efficient movement of labor
toward high-productivity producers, then reductions in the number and
impact of such firms may be a **cause for concern**]{.underline}. While
we have highlighted the year 2000 as a turning point for trend growth
rates across several categories of firms, that year should not be
interpreted as precise---nor should we necessarily expect the effect of
changes in reallocative patterns on aggregate productivity to be
instantaneous. Further research is necessary to determine whether the
patterns we describe are related to Fernald\'s (2014) evidence of a
trend break in US productivity growth around 2003.

While we have attempted to describe in detail several aspects of
declining skewness in the U.S. using industry, size, and age
comparisons, [we have not identified the underlying causes of these
trends]{.underline}. Theory suggests several possible candidates. In
canonical models of firm dynamics, rapid growth of individual firms
results from revelations about, or changing realizations of, firm-level
productivity or demand conditions. [Firms may]{.underline} sometimes
[operate below optimal scale as a result of]{.underline} [credit
constraints]{.underline} or imperfect information about their own
quality, [and high growth follows the **loosening of these constraints**
as the firm size distribution evolves to better reflect the underlying
firm productivity distribution]{.underline}. In other research, we
empirically study the relationship between productivity and
establishment growth in the high tech Manufacturing sector and find that
recent changes in growth patterns reflect declining sensitivity of
businesses to productivity shocks rather than declining productivity
dispersion or persistence (Decker et al., 2016). Those findings point in
the direction of increasing adjustment frictions or changes in market
structure that somewhat insulate businesses from the competitive
pressures that typically drive productivity responsiveness.25

Alternatively, changes in employment growth patterns could reflect an
optimally changing role of the employment adjustment margin for firm
growth. For example, it might be that, historically, young businesses
with high draws of productivity and profitability rapidly added
employees, while more recently innovative businesses grow by adding
machines or expanding internationally. Alternatively, changing business
models may imply that young, innovative businesses now increasingly find
it profitable to be acquired by larger, mature businesses. If these
changes in firm dynamics are at work, declining skewness may matter less
for productivity growth but still be of critical importance for job
growth.

Investigating these alternative hypotheses should have high priority.
Historically, [the U.S. has exhibited a high pace of entrepreneurship
with a small share of fast growing young firms disproportionately
accounting for job creation and productivity growth]{.underline}. The
[decline in]{.underline} [startups and the accompanying decline
in]{.underline} high growth [young firms]{.underline} either
[suggests]{.underline} **[adverse consequences]{.underline}** [for U.S.
**economic growth**]{.underline} or a change in the way that such growth
will be achieved. Only through identifying the causes of the decline in
entrepreneurship and high growth young firms will it be possible to
understand the possible consequences.

Labor provisions

The most striking difference about **[this new deal involves protections
for workers in all three countries]{.underline}**. The agreement calls
for 40 to 45 percent of automobile components to be made by workers who
earn at least \$16 an hour by 2023. This provision specifically targets
Mexico **[and is meant to bring wages]{.underline}** there
**[up]{.underline}** to US and Canadian standards. That's good for
Mexican workers, but that's not the only motivation behind it. The Trump
administration hopes that **[[if Mexico no longer pays its workers a lot
less than the US and Canada do]{.mark}, [companies will no longer have a
reason to move their factories]{.mark}]{.underline}** there (and **[[out
of the US), thus keeping manufacturing jobs in the
US]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Canada. In addition, Mexico has agreed to
pass laws giving workers the right to real union representation, to
extend labor protections to migrants workers (who are often from Central
America), and to protect women from discrimination. And unlike NAFTA,
[the new deal allows each country to sanction the others for labor
violations that impact trade]{.underline}. It's a complex, multi-step
process modeled after similar protections in the Trans-Pacific
Partnership (TPP), a multinational trade deal that Trump pulled the
United States out of after taking office. **[[These are much-needed
reforms]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and they address a lot of concerns that
US labor unions have long had about NAFTA.

The Importance of Technological Leadership

A half century of social science on precedents in which rising powers
competed with system leaders underscores the importance of the quality
of economic leadership---evaluated primarily in terms of dominance in
technology and energy---over quantity of economic output or other
variables.43 [Why is technological predominance so
important?]{.underline} The first, most fundamental reason is that
[long-term economic growth is predicated on generating radical new
technologies]{.underline} ([new products, methods of production,
markets, trade routes, fuel sources, and commercial
organizations]{.underline} à la Joseph Schumpeter's intermittent bouts
of creative destruction). [Whichever economy masters these new
technologies first profits most from its pioneering
innovations]{.underline}. In due time, [the world economy's leading
innovator is likely to extend its lead to commercial, financial, and
military areas as well]{.underline}. Ultimately [the leading economy can
shape the global economy according to its own preferences]{.underline}
and advantage. Second, [mastering surges in new technologies thus means
that the leading economy]{.underline}---i.e., the country with the most
technologically innovative economy---[maintains the most competitive and
lucrative position in the global econom]{.underline}y. But it also means
that [technological superiority is transferred between the military and
civilian economies]{.underline}. Gains made in military technology can
be transferred to the civilian economy, and [gains made in the civilian
economy can be transferred to military technology]{.underline}. Examples
of the former may be seen in the transfer of radar technology from the
military to the civilian sector, while an example of the latter can be
seen in the way basic research at universities has traditionally fueled
advances in weapons technologies. [The country with the leading economy
thus is well positioned to also field the most technologically advanced
military.]{.underline} As a consequence, it is likely to develop a
command of the global commons and, for a period of time, unrivaled
global reach. Third, [technological predominance generates huge economic
gains]{.underline} [because corporations in the leading economy are set
up to dominate new markets in the new industries]{.underline}. The
expansion of commercial activity abroad to exploit new markets means
that technological leaders profit enormously from a functioning and
stable world economy, and are thus well positioned to provide global
military and political leadership. A vivid example of this may be seen
in [the expansion of U.S. multinational corporations]{.underline} in the
twentieth century, which [fueled the need for a large military force
that could police trade routes and the global commons to keep the world
economy operating]{.underline} as [smoothly]{.underline} as possible.
[The global presence of U.S. companies and military forces provided a
strong incentive for U.S. leaders to focus on solving global issues. It
also encouraged countries around the world to look to the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [as a leader]{.underline},
since it alone had the resources and reach to address global problems.
Finally, a fourth reason [technological predominance]{.underline}
matters is that it [fuels the soft power that makes the leading economy
attractive.]{.underline} People around the world tend to admire and
emulate the wonders of new technology as manifested in a vibrant and
sophisticated economy. The media reinforces the appeal of the leading
economy by delivering messages about how citizens in that country employ
new technologies to enhance their quality of life. [The technological
superiority of the leading economy also yields soft power because the
country's political and military advantages allow it to exercise
influence at levels unattainable by other countries]{.underline}.
Technological predominance cannot deliver legitimacy, however, and thus
a country with attractive political and cultural values and ideals will
be better positioned to maintain its influence than one that relies
heavily on coercion, such as today's authoritarian China. But the main
point remains: technological predominance opens opportunities for a
country to increase its soft power. The importance of technological
leadership means that the popular focus on the quantity of China's
economic output as the key index of national power is in many ways
insufficient. China, after all, had the world's largest economy in the
1700s and 1800s, but its relatively low level of technology and energy
consumption left it at the mercy of much smaller Western countries that
possessed more dynamic economies, fossil fuel-driven energy, and
powerful militaries. The United States, by contrast, built its
post--World War II global primacy on the foundation of an impressive
technological-energy prowess. The accelerated rate of technology
transfer and energy consumption in the 21st century, however, has
considerably weakened this lead.44 Asia, in particular, has made rapid
gains that pose a challenge to U.S. technological leadership.45 For now,
despite impressive economic and technological gains, China continues to
lag behind the United States. Per capita GDP is regarded as an indicator
of the level of technological achievement (albeit an imperfect one), and
as of 2014 the United States' per capita GDP was more than eight times
that of China.46 But [Chinese officials have made technological
leadership a key policy priority and are investing enormous sums of time
and money accordingly. The result is t]{.underline}hat analysts now
debate whether [China could at some point surpass the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to become the world leader in
technological innovation]{.underline}.47

case]{.underline} with the tools at our disposal [a century from

**spread permanently beyond the earth**, enabled by advances in
**spaceflight**, manufacturing, robotics, and terraforming, is one that
is much **more likely to endure**]{.underline}. However, [the
breathtaking power of the tools we are developing is **not to be taken
lightly**]{.underline}. [We have been very lucky to muddle through the
advent of nuclear weapons without a global catastroph]{.underline}e. And
within this century, it is realistic to expect that we will be able to
rewrite much of biology to our purposes, intervene deliberately and in a
large-scale way in the workings of our global climate, and even develop
agents with intelligence that is fundamentally alien to ours, and may
vastly surpass our own in some or even most domains---a development that
would have uniquely unpredictable consequences.

Current [advances in science and technology]{.underline}, while not
sufficient in themselves, [will play a **key role**]{.underline} [in

recognized as having unlocked a **level of prosperity**]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} a rate and scale of scientific and technological
[progress that would simply not have been possible without
them]{.underline}. While a continued reliance on fossil fuels would be
catastrophic for our environment, it is unclear whether many of the
["clean technology" breakthroughs]{.underline} that **[will allow us to
break our dependence on fossil fuels]{.underline}** would have been
possible without the scientific breakthroughs that were enabled
directly, or indirectly, by this rich, abundant, and easily available
fuel source. The goal is clear: [having benefitted so tremendously from
this "dirty" stage of technology, we now need to take advantage of the
opportunity it gives us to move onto cleaner and more powerful
next-generation energy and manufacturing technologies.]{.underline} The
challenge will be to do so before thresholds of irreversible global
consequence have been passed.

As such, **[the current round of [NAFTA negotiations going

agreement **[[pose]{.mark} [a ]{.mark}]{.underline}**far, far
**[[great]{.underline}]{.mark}**er **[[threat to
Mexico]{.underline}]{.mark}** than to Canada or the United States. It
would be damaging, but not fatal, to the Canadian economy. **[[For
Mexico, it is an existential threat]{.underline}]{.mark}**. \"For
Canada, NAFTA is all about trade and economic growth,\" said Agustin
Barrios Gomez, a former social-democratic Mexican member of parliament
who specializes in Mexico-U.S. relations. \"[[For Mexico, NAFTA]{.mark}
is a national-security agreement -- it is an agreement that [anchors an
**entire geostrategic situation**]{.mark} in North America. It is
infinitely more important. It [establishes an entire direction for the
country]{.mark}.\"]{.underline} Indeed, by signing NAFTA in 1994, Mexico
transformed its entire economic system from one that was often
state-owned and closed to the world into an export-oriented economy that
has raised living standards and built a middle class. That
transformation was painful and often ugly and is far from complete: The
entire southern half of the country has missed most of the trade-driven
growth, and while the very poor remain loyal to Mr. Pena Nieto\'s party,
the darkening prospects for North American integration and a general
disgust with the Trump atmosphere have led many to reject the status
quo. \"In Mexico, there\'s an element of betrayal that goes missing in a
lot of these discussions of NAFTA,\" Mr. Barrios Gomez said.
\"Twenty-three years later, after we have gone through all the pain of
adjustment, it turns out the **[[Americans]{.mark} are [going back on
their word]{.mark}. It[\'s]{.mark} not just [a matter of political
stability]{.mark}, it[\'s a matter]{.mark} [of being humiliated and
betrayed by a neighbour]{.mark}]{.underline}**.\" To make matters worse,
Mr. Pena Nieto\'s party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party -- which
governed Mexico for seven decades as a centre-left de facto autocracy
before a decade in opposition forced it to reform itself -- has once
again come to be seen as corrupt and self-serving and perhaps too
beholden to Washington. The mainstream left-wing and centre-right
opposition parties aren\'t well organized and appear too, well,
mainstream. Politicians such as Mr. Barrios Gomez warn that Canada is in
a precarious position: **[[One wrong move]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- even
one that sacrifices NAFTA to preserve Canadian interests -- **[[could
provoke a shift to dangerous instability in our vulnerable partner
nation. \"It\'s not inconceivable that you could]{.mark} end up
[hav]{.mark}ing [a rogue nation right next door]{.mark} to the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates -- [and for no good

### Impact I/L -- Stability 

#### USMCA key to stability

**Packard 19** - trade policy counsel for the R Street Institute (Clark,
"Two changes could pave the way for the USMCA trade agreement,"
<https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/two-changes-could-pave-the-way-for-the-usmca-trade-agreement>)

It has been a tumultuous time for North American commercial relations.
For too long, President [Trump has misled the public about]{.underline}
the supposed [failures of]{.underline} the **[N]{.underline}**orth
**[A]{.underline}**merican **[F]{.underline}**ree
**[T]{.underline}**rade **[A]{.underline}**greement, [sowing
uncertainty]{.underline} and doubt [about the future of the trading
relationship]{.underline}. [The next few months will be crucial to
repair that damage]{.underline}. Two policy changes could help deliver
much-needed certainty and grease the skids for NAFTA's replacement, the
United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. First, the United States needs to
lift the dubious "national security" tariffs it levied on Mexico and
Canadian steel and aluminum imports. Doing so would be savvy politics
and policy. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, the ranking member on the House
Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over trade policy,
recently said Congress will not pass the USMCA as long as the steel and
aluminum tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports remain in place.
Echoing Brady, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa,
suggested after meeting with the respective foreign ministers that
neither Canada nor Mexico will move forward to ratify USMCA as long as
the tariffs remain in place. The steel and aluminum tariffs have been
misguided policy all along. The U.S. military's steel and aluminum needs
amount to only about 3 percent of domestic production. Not only does the
Pentagon not rely on imported steel and aluminum, but Mexico and Canada
are longstanding allies who pose no national security threat to the
United States. Moreover, the tariffs have raised costs on consumers and
failed to revive the steel and aluminum industries. As Benn Steil of the
Council on Foreign Relations noted in a recent blog post, the steel
industry has taken a nosedive over the past year since the tariffs were
announced. The only winner here has been steel industry lobbyists.
According to a recent Wall Street Journal story, steel lobbying
expenditures topped \$12 million in 2018, up considerably from the past
two years. Meanwhile, north of the border, the Province of Alberta
recently announced significant cuts to its crude oil production in order
to combat the supposed scourge of low prices. The cuts coincided with
Saudi Arabia's production cuts at the end of 2018. Canada supplied about
40 percent of U.S. imported oil in 2017. This decision will put upward
pressure on prices and further jeopardize North American commercial
relations. There are already signs the plan is backfiring. The initial
plan to cut production by 325,000 barrels a day beginning in January was
meant to clear a glut of excess oil. Officials recently lowered the
mandated reduction by 75,000 barrels a day, to 250,000, after complaints
by Alberta oil producers. To date, inventories have fallen by about 5
million barrels. As oil prices have skyrocketed, oil shipments in Canada
have precipitously declined in recent weeks. It is simply becoming too
expensive to ship Alberta's oil right now. Though the Alberta
government's decision to permit more production was a step in the right
direction, more needs to be done. North American firms are dependent on
stable and predictable supplies of oil. This issue could become a point
of contention as policymakers across North America look to finalize the
USMCA. Unnecessary commercial tensions will only stand in the way of
progress. Despite being a target for misleading rhetoric and unnecessary
threats from politicians, [NAFTA has been a tremendous
success]{.underline}. Since NAFTA's inception, tariffs, and other
barriers have fallen across North America and trade volumes have
increased. **[The pact has integrated the economies and served as a
bulwark for stability]{.underline}**. [Mexico and Canada are important
allies]{.underline} and our commercial relationships are an integral
part of that alliance. [We can provide additional certainty to this
relationship]{.underline}, but policymakers in the U.S. and Canada need
to address some outstanding issues before the USMCA will become reality.

#### USMCA and updated NAFTA key to Mexican FDI and internal political stability

Luis **Rubio, 4-15**-2019, \"Why NAFTA Is Critical for Mexico,\"
Americas Quarterly,
<https://www.americasquarterly.org/content/why-nafta-critical-mexico>
//RS

For Mexico, the North American Free Trade Agreement as originally
designed was much more about politics than trade. The George Bush
administration that negotiated the agreement understood that and, in
fact, saw NAFTA in geopolitical, rather than economic terms. [A senior
adviser to the White House]{.underline} at that time once told me that
it was "a no-brainer[: a prosperous Mexico is in the best interest of
the United States.]{.underline}" How times change. **[The importance of
NAFTA cannot be overstated,]{.underline}** which is why uncertainty over
its replacement, provoked first by Donald Trump as a candidate for the
presidency and now by the Democrat-held Congress, is so dangerous. NAFTA
was conceived as a mechanism through which the Mexican government
obtained a kind of certificate from the U.S. government as a guarantor
that the rules of the game would be preserved, that an open trading
regime would be maintained and that the commitments made in the
agreement would be strictly adhered to. [In this sense, [NAFTA
constitutes an anchor of stability, a source of certainty that enjoys
international support and recognitio]{.mark}]{.underline}[n]{.mark}.
[[This certainty is key]{.mark} both [for internal confidence and for
attracting foreign investment]{.mark}]{.underline}. Mexico proposed the
trade and investment agreement in 1990 after having gone through a
series of economic reforms that streamlined the federal government's
finances, liberalized the economy and modernized its regulatory
framework. The objective was to attract investment in order to foster
fast economic growth. However, [potential investors, both domestic and
foreign, worried about the country's propensity for changing the
rules]{.underline}, carrying out unlawful expropriations and making
capricious decisions without notice. [Th[rough NAFTA, Mexico's
government committed to preserving the rule of law]{.underline}]{.mark}
[implicit in the agreement and submitted itself to the procedures
established by Chapter 11 on dispute resolution.]{.underline} **[The
result was an extraordinary source of certainty for
investors]{.underline}**, which led to the establishment of new
ventures, plants and operations in the country. [Mexico's expectations
for attracting investment were far superior to what actually
materialized]{.underline}, not because of NAFTA, but because of a new
player in the field to which neither the Americans nor the Mexicans had
given even the slightest thought: China. But over the past quarter
century, [NAFTA fulfilled its political role]{.underline} beyond
expectations. Mexico accepted dramatically limiting the latitude of
future governments for making changes to the basic framework of economic
policy (the open trading regime) in the event that a president with a
different economic philosophy came to government. In this regard, NAFTA
was fundamentally a political act, a proxy for a lack of checks and
balances that are present in the United States. It is thanks to NAFTA
that Mexican economic policy was not altered in the midst of the massive
crisis of 1995. In contrast with the geopolitical clarity that motivated
the first Bush administration, Trump\'s rhetoric and actions altered
Mexico's politics in a dramatic way. First, by putting the existing
NAFTA in doubt in 2016, it created a political vacuum that was filled by
the winner of Mexico\'s presidential contest in 2018, Andrés Manuel
López Obrador. Second, and most importantly, it opened the way for a
series of decisions that slowly but surely will eliminate or neutralize
autonomous regulatory agencies that were created over the past two
decades in energy, competition, telecoms and, now, the Supreme Court.
Put simply, [NAFTA's erosion has had an immense impact on
Mexico.]{.underline} Despite the rhetoric, **[[NAFTA has fulfilled its
core objective of supporting Mexico's political
stability]{.underline}]{.mark}** through the creation of a framework
that made it possible to attract investment and for about half the
country to grow above 6% and, in some states, such as Aguascalientes and
Queretaro, at Asian rates. Surely, NAFTA did not transform all of
Mexico, for that would have required much deeper reforms for which the
Mexican establishment was not ready. In fact, NAFTA (and migration to
the U.S.) helped preserve the status quo, an unintended consequence of a
trade and investment agreement that nonetheless served its core purpose.
One could speculate what might have happened had China not become such a
powerful force in the world trade arena, but the one certainty is that
Mexico lost significant opportunities as a result. [[The

#### NAFTA collapse destroys Mexican stability---nationalism, export volumes, sector integration, investor confidence

Collapse of Nafta,\" No Publication,

Mexico is steeling itself for the increasing possibility that the United
States will pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement,
[envisioning how the Mexican economy would adapt [without the
deal]{.mark}]{.underline} that has guided relations between the
neighbors for a quarter‑century. Since President Trump's election
victory, Mexico has put negotiations for new or updated trade deals with
other countries on a fast track, seeking markets for its exports and new
suppliers. President Enrique Peña Nieto recently traveled to China to
discuss trade, among other issues; Mexico is a member of the
Trans‑Pacific Partnership trade accord. Already new suppliers are
emerging. In December, Argentina is expected to deliver 30,000 tons of
wheat, its first sale ever to Mexico. Crisp Chilean apples have begun to
appear on Mexico's supermarket shelves, next to piles of apples from
Washington State. "There are ways to adapt to contain the impact," said
Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal, the economy minister in a televised
interview. Kalach, who leads the Mexican business delegation to the
Nafta talks, said companies were talking to the government about how to
adapt. "What do we do to remain competitive and to continue developing
our manufacturing and our agriculture?" he said. But [the [fallout in
Mexico could have ripple effects that extend well beyond
trade]{.mark}]{.underline}. A United States exit from Nafta **[could
provoke nationalist sentiments]{.underline}** affecting Mexico's
presidential election next year. Negotiators for Mexico, the United
States and Canada last week began a fourth round of talks originally
intended to modernize the deal, which underpins trade and investment
among the three countries and has reshaped Mexico's economy. But
Washington has floated protectionist proposals that both Mexico and
Canada have said they will not accept, handing Mr. Trump a reason to
make good on his repeated promises to withdraw. Foreign Minister Luis
Videgaray warned legislators last week that Mexico was prepared to exit
the talks rather than accept a harmful deal. Luis Videgaray, Mexico's
foreign minister, warned legislators last week that Mexico was prepared
to exit the talks rather than accept a harmful deal. Ginnette
Riquelme/Reuters For all of Mr. Trump's heated comments, describing
Nafta as the "worst trade deal ever made," [the effect of the accord has
been exponentially larger on Mexico]{.underline} than on the United
States, where the economy is about 18 times as large as the economy of
its southern neighbor. **[[Mexico has transformed from an inward‑looking
oil producer to a manufacturing powerhouse]{.underline}]{.mark}**, its
factories rolling out cars, computers and machinery for export. Mexican
tomatoes, avocados and broccoli crowd the aisles of American
supermarkets. [Newer industries like aerospace and medical equipment are
thriving]{.underline}. Last year, [[Mexican exports amounted to \$374
billion, with more than 80 percent of that going to the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}. But Mexico's broader performance under
Nafta has been a disappointment. The domestic economy never kept pace
with the success of exports, and the gap between the export‑ driven
north and the rural south has widened. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of
Canada arrived in Mexico on Thursday for a visit that symbolized the two
countries' solidarity on Nafta against their larger neighbor. Jose
Mendez/European Pressphoto Agency Now Mexico faces the possibility of a
shock to the most dynamic part of its economy. **[[The collapse of Nafta
threatens to reduce the volume of exports]{.mark} to the United States
[by removing their duty‑free access and]{.mark} to [halt investment by
companies]{.mark} that establish Mexican factories]{.underline}** to
make products for the American market. Still, the question is what a
post‑Nafta economy would look like. The Mexican government's view is
that the United States market would remain largely open. Without Nafta,
American duties on Mexican goods would revert to levels set by the World
Trade Organization. The figures vary, although the average is estimated
to be about 3 percent for manufactured products. Cars assembled in
Mexico, for example, would pay a duty of 2.5 percent. "Do we like those
duties? No. Can we live with them? Yes," said Luis de la Calle, a former
trade negotiator for Mexico. "The integration of Mexico, the United
States and Canada will continue regardless of the governments. Mexican
workers demonstrated for higher wages last week in the city of Mexicali.
Juan Barak/European Pressphoto Agency "But," he added, "there will be
uncertainty in the short term." Mr. Guajardo, the economic minister,
said Mexican‑made light trucks, for example, would face a 25 percent
duty in the United States. Converting factories to the production of
cars, which would be subject to the much lower duty, could be a
response. Even before Nafta, assembly plants known as maquiladoras
imported parts duty free and sent the finished product back to the
United States. The end of Nafta "may not be an absolute game changer,"
said Manuel Padrón‑Castillo, a trade lawyer at Baker McKenzie in Ciudad
Juárez, across the border from El Paso, Tex. Over the longer term, other
analysts said, an American withdrawal from Nafta "would call into
question the viability of Mexico as an outsourcing destination," said
Dan Ciuriak, a trade expert at the Center for International Governance
Innovation in Waterloo, Ontario. From left, Ildefonso Guajardo
Villarreal, Chrystia Freeland and Robert E. Lighth, the representatives
of Mexico, Canada and the United States, during negotiations last month
in Ottawa. Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press
Under Nafta, a complex network has evolved in which raw materials and
parts move easily across borders, often several times, to be assembled
into larger pieces and finally into a finished product. Without Nafta,
even small duties would add up in such a manufacturing system. "**[The
[deeply integrated sectors would face tremendous
disruption]{.mark}]{.underline}**," Mr. Ciuriak said. If tariffs rise,
one possible effect could be that companies move more production from
the United States to Mexico to reduce the number of parts requiring duty
payments. The other risk is that companies move production to Asia,
buying parts there instead of in North America, and paying a single duty
when the finished product enters the United States. Ford Motor Company
set the example this year. In January, it scrapped plans to build a
factory in Mexico to produce the Focus, a small passenger car, a
decision that won praise from Mr. Trump. But in June, the company
announced that it would build a new Focus The national flags of Canada,
the United States and Mexico flew at the start of North American Free
Trade Agreement negotiations in Washington in August. Jacquelyn
Martin/Associated Press factory in China instead. A withdrawal from
Nafta could also have far‑reaching political consequences. It "will be
interpreted as a rejection of Mexico and Mexicanness and that will
complicate the politics of the relationship with the United States,"
said Mr. de la Calle, the former trade negotiator. A collapse of Nafta
is likely to be a liability for Mexico's centrist candidates in next
year's presidential election; the front‑runner now is Andrés Manuel
López Obrador, a leftist populist, although he has not yet made an issue
of Mexico's relationship with the United States. Juan Francisco Torres
Landa, a trade lawyer with Hogan Lovells in Mexico City, warned that Mr.
Trump had opened "a Pandora's box." "When I was in elementary school,"
he said, "we learned: 'Watch out for the Americans. They invaded us a
couple of times, they took half our territory.' " All that had been
forgotten, he said, as Mexico and the United States moved closer under
Nafta. But Mexicans' historical wariness may revive in the presidential
campaign, he warned. "Somebody may say the enemy is Trump or the U.S.,
and I am the guy who can stand up to this."

As noted previously, **[there is]{.underline}** arguably **[no
region]{.underline}** (including Asia) upon [**which the U**nited
**S**tates **is more dependent for its**]{.underline} prosperity and
**[security]{.underline}**, and with which it is more closely tied
through bonds of family, than Latin America and the Caribbean. In terms
of trade and investment, from manufacturers to the food Americans put on
the table, there is no region for which disruption of commerce with the
United States could do more damage to our economy and the everyday lives
of Americans. Reciprocally, the region's proximity to the United States
makes it a logical and attractive business partner; there is not another
region of the world for which prosperity, healthy infrastructure, and
institutions could contribute more to a win-win commercial relationship
with the United States. With respect to security, [**[the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates **[is blessed by the absence of
neighbors that]{.mark} pose a** direct military **threat** to the
nation, **[are experiencing conditions of chaos, or permit U.S.
adversaries to operate from their territory]{.mark}**. Yet,
**[if]{.mark} these** fortunate **[conditions]{.mark} were to
[change]{.mark}, [the]{.mark}** resulting **[threat]{.mark}** to U.S.
national security **[could]{.mark}** force a significant
**[reorient]{.mark}**ation of [U.S. **security initiatives away from**
its **foreign engagements** to ]{.mark}]{.underline}address the emergent
threat closer to home. To use a military analogy, Latin America and the
Caribbean is, for the United States, an "unoccupied high ground." The
fact that the United States does not fully leverage the opportunities
offered by Latin America, nor suffers a significant immediate security
threat from the region, does not make it any less strategic. The
Challenge of Transnational Organized Crime in the Region. The activities
of transnational organized crime in Latin America and the Caribbean,
often characterized as the principle security issue in the region, is
more of a strategic challenge to the United States than is commonly
understood. On the one hand, the activities of groups such as the Maras
in the Northern Triangle and warring cartels in [**[Mexico]{.mark}**
generate violence and destroy economic opportunity in ways that generate
refugee flows toward the United States.]{.underline} Indeed, the 2014
crisis of child migrants from Central America obliged the Obama
administration to request an additional \$3.7 billion to respond to the
situation, eclipsing the \$979 million previously spent on the region
under the Central America Regional Security Initiative since 2008.2 In
addition, the money used to enable transnational criminal activities
corrupts institutions, undermining governance, and expanding criminal
networks that can be used by terrorist organizations to raise and
launder money, smuggle persons and materiel through the region, as well
as creating spaces in which they can hide, train, plan operations, and
recruit fighters for their global activities. Such threats are magnified
further where anti-U.S. governments, such as the "Bolivarian Socialist"
government of Venezuela, tolerate and possibly even facilitate the
activities of such groups, permitting, for example, the entry of Iranian
paramilitary Qods forces into the region through the country.3 The Need
for U.S. Scenario Planning to Include the Potential Use of the Region by
U.S. Adversaries to Conduct Actions Against the United States. Military
professionals in the United States have the responsibility for planning
how to fight the nation's wars if called upon to do so by their elected
leaders. In today's globally interconnected world, [it is highly
unlikely that a U.S. "near-peer competitor," such as **[China or
Russia]{.mark}**, would allow the United States to engage with them in
such a conflict]{.underline} (however undesirable) [entirely as an "away
game."]{.underline} U.S. defense planners must expect that [[in]{.mark}
such [a conflict]{.mark}, the adversary [would employ]{.mark} its full
global range of assets, capabilities, and options, including:
relationships and access agreements with foreign
[militaries]{.mark}]{.underline} (however benign) [in all parts of the
world]{.underline}, knowledge of, and the potential for, staging
activities leveraging their commercial operations near the United
States, as well as information technology infrastructure built by the
adversary's companies there. [[Potential U.S. adversaries]{.mark} such
as Russia and China [may be expected to leverage]{.mark} such assets and
relationships [in Latin America]{.mark} and the Caribbean]{.underline},
in addition to other regions, [in order to undermine U.S. coalition
formation in the run-up to a conflict]{.underline}, to conduct
operations in the region during the conflict to disrupt the U.S. economy
and financial system, and potentially [[to **conduct military
operations**]{.mark} from Latin America and the Caribbean to attack U.S.
deployment and sustainment flows, [and]{.mark} to **[put the]{.mark}**
U.S. **[homeland at risk,]{.mark}** thus **[forcing]{.mark}** the
**diversion** of U.S. forces from other theaters]{.underline}. While
[Russia and China]{.underline} have not currently established formal
military bases in the region that could be used against the United
States, their familiarity with Latin American armed forces through
regular military-to-military engagement, their knowledge of regional
infrastructure such as ports, airports, and commercial logistics
systems, means that they [could achieve a functional military capability
in the region rapidly in the **months** leading up to the
[conflict]{.mark},]{.underline} if U.S. adversaries in Latin America
permitted them to do so.

#### That leads to nuclear war

As the previous chapter demonstrates, for the past two hundred years
[[the]{.mark} **principal cause** of [concern]{.mark} for U.S.
defense]{.underline} policymakers and planners [thinking [about **Latin
America** has been]{.mark} the prospect]{.underline} that [[great
powers]{.mark} outside the]{.underline} Western [**Hemisphere** [could
exploit the]{.mark}]{.underline} military weakness and [**[internal
security]{.mark}** [challenges]{.mark} of the states]{.underline} within
it [[to threaten **U.S. security**]{.mark}.]{.underline} While [there is
reason for optimism about the **future of Latin
America**]{.underline},58 there is also cause for concern. The region
faces enduring obstacles to economic59 and political development60 as
well as significant internal security challenges. As General John Kelly,
the commander of U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM)61 noted in his March
2013 posture statement before Congress, Latin America: \>I@s a region of
enormous promise and exciting opportunities, but it is also one of
persistent challenges and complex threats. It is a region of relative
peace, low likelihood of interstate conflicts, and overall economic
growth, yet is also home to corrosive criminal violence, permissive
environments for illicit activities, and episodic political and social
protests.62 The **[[instability]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
non-traditional security [[challenges]{.underline}]{.mark} that General
Kelly cites [[provide]{.mark} potential [opportunities
for]{.mark}]{.underline} the United States' major [[**rivals**
to]{.underline}]{.mark} (borrowing a term from Monroe's declaration)
["[inter]{.mark}pose" themselves [into **the region**
and]{.mark}]{.underline}, by so doing, [[threaten]{.mark} **regional
[stability]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **U.S.
[security]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Two discernible trends suggest that
current and prospective Eurasian [[rivals could
seek]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[to]{.underline}]{.mark}** exploit regional
conditions and dynamics in ways that could [[impose]{.underline}]{.mark}
immense [[costs on the United States and]{.mark} **[divert]{.mark} its
[attention]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} more distant]{.underline} theaters
**[[overseas]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The first trend is a [[return to
a]{.mark} heightened level of [competition among **the "great
powers"**]{.mark} following]{.underline} two decades of [**U.S.
dominance**.]{.underline} The second trend concerns the growing cost of
projecting power by traditional military means due to the proliferation
of "anti-access/area-denial" (A2/AD) capabilities in general, and
precision-guided munitions (PGMs) in particular. These trends suggest
that, despite a possible decline in relative U.S. power, external forces
will continue to find it beyond their means to threaten the hemisphere
through traditional forms of power projection. Far more likely is a
return of a competition similar to that which the United States engaged
in with the Soviet Union during the Cold War. During that period both
powers sought to avoid direct conflict with the other, given the risks
of escalation to nuclear conflict. Instead each focused primarily on
gaining an advantage over the other through the employment of client
states and non-state groups as proxies. Proxies were employed for
reasons other than avoiding a direct clash, such as gaining positional
advantage (e.g., enabling the sponsor to establish bases in its country,
as the Soviets did in Cuba). Proxies were also employed as a means of
diverting a rival's attention from what was considered the key region of
the competition and to impose disproportionate costs on a rival (e.g.,
Moscow's support of 1orth Vietnam as a means of drawing ŏ U.S. resources
from Europe). This chapter outlines trends in the Western Hemisphere
security environment that outside powers may seek to exploit to advance
their objectives in ways that threaten regional stability and U.S.
security. This is followed by a discussion of how these external powers
might proceed to do so. Seeds of Instability Crime, Illicit Networks,
and Under-Governed Areas Latin America has a long history of banditry,
smuggling, and organized crime. As in the case of Pancho Villa and the
1916-1917 Punitive Expedition, these activities have occasionally risen
to a level at which they inÀuence U.S. national security calculations.
Rarely, however, have these activities been as pervasive and
destabilizing as they are today. Although a wide variety of illicit
activity occurs in Latin America, criminal organizations conducting drug
trȧcking are the dominant forces in the Latin American underworld today,
accounting for roughly 0 billion per year63 of an estimated 100 billion
in annual illicit trade.6Since the Colombian cartels were dismantled in
the 1990s, this lucrative trade has been dominated by powerful Mexican
cartels whose operations extend across the length and breadth of Mexico,
as well as up the supply chain into the cocaine-producing regions of the
Andean Ridge and through their wholesale and retail drug distribution
networks across the United States.65 The cartels, along with countless
smaller criminal organizations, comprise what the head of SOUTHCOM has
described as, \>a@n interconnected system of arteries that traverse the
entire Western Hemisphere, stretching across the Atlantic and Paci¿c,
through the Caribbean, and up and down 1orth, South, and Central America
. . . \>a@ vast system of illicit pathways \>that is used@ to move tons
of drugs, thousands of people, and countless weapons into and out of the
United States, Europe, and Africa with an ėciency, payload, and gross
pro¿t any global transportation company would envy.66 That being said,
the drug trȧcking underworld is by no means a monolithic entity or
cooperative alliance. Rather, it is a fractious and brutally competitive
business in which rival entities are constantly and literally ¿ghting to
maximize their share of the drug trade and for control of the critical
transshipment points, or plazas, through which it Àows. To attack their
competitor's operations and protect their own operations from rivals and
the Mexican government's crackdown that began in 2006, the cartels have
built up larger, better armed, and more ruthless forces of hired gunmen
known as sicarios. Using the billions of dollars generated by their
illicit activities, they have acquired weapons and equipment formerly
reserved for state armies or state-sponsored insurgent groups, including
body armor, assault riÀes, machine guns, grenades, landmines, anti-tank
rockets, mortars, car bombs, armored vehicles, helicopters, transport
planes, and---perhaps most remarkably---long-range submersibles.67 The
cartels' pro¿ts have also enabled them to hire former police and
military personnel, including members of several countries' elite
special operations units68 and, in several cases, active and former
members of the U.S. military.69 These personnel bring with them---and
can provide to the cartels---a level of training and tactical pro¿ciency
that can be equal or superior to those of the government forces they
face. As a result of this pro¿ciency and the military-grade weapons
possessed by the cartels, more than 2,500 Mexican police ȯcers and 200
military personnel were killed in confrontations with organized crime
forces between 2008 and 2012 along with tens of thousands of
civilians.70 In the poorer states of Central America, state security
forces operate at an even greater disadvantage.71 While their
paramilitary forces enable the cartels to dominate entire cities and
large remote areas through force and intimidation, they are not the only
tool available. The cartels also leverage their immense wealth to buy
the silence or support of police and government ȯcials who are often
presented with a choice between plata o plomo---"silver or lead."
According to the head of the Mexican Federal Police, around 2010 the
cartels were spending an estimated 100 million each month on bribes to
police.72 By buying ŏ ȯcials---and torturing or killing those who cannot
be corrupted---the cartels have greatly undermined the ĕectiveness of
national government forces in general and local police in particular.
This, in turn, has undermined the con¿dence of the population in their
government's willingness and ability to protect them. Through these
means and methods the cartels have gained a substantial degree of de
facto control over many urban and rural areas across Mexico, including
major cities and large swathes of territory along the U.S.-Mexico
border. In many of these crime-ridden areas the loss of con¿dence in the
government and police has prompted the formation of vigilante militias,
presenting an additional challenge to government control.73 Meanwhile,
in the "northern triangle" of Central America (the area comprising
Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador through which the cartels transship
almost all cocaine bound for Mexico and the United States) the situation
is even more dire. Approximately 90 percent of crimes in this area go
unpunished, while in Guatemala roughly half the country's territory is
ĕectively under drug trȧckers' control.7Further south, similar pockets
of lawlessness exist in coca-growing areas in Colombia, Venezuela,
Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. In Colombia and along its borders with
Venezuela, Ecuador, and Peru, much of the coca-growing territory remains
under the control of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or
FARC. A guerrilla organization founded in the 1960s as a
Marxist-Leninist revolutionary movement dedicated to the overthrow of
the Colombian government, the FARC embraced coca growing in the 1990s as
a means of funding its operations and has subsequently evolved into a
hybrid mix of left-wing insurgent group and pro¿t-driven cartel.76 This
hybrid nature has facilitated cooperation between the FARC and
ideological sympathizers like the Bolivarian Alliance, Hezbollah, Al
Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and other extremist groups77 as well as
with purely criminal organizations like the Mexican cartels. Although
the FARC has been greatly weakened over the past decade and no longer
poses the existential threat to the Colombian government that it once
did, it remains ¿rmly in control of large tracts of coca-producing
jungle, mostly straddling the borders between Colombia and FARC
supporters Venezuela and Ecuador. In summary, organized crime elements
have exploited under-governed areas to establish zones under their de
facto control. In so doing they pose a signi¿cant and growing threat to
regional security in general and U.S. interests in particular. As
SOUTHCOM commander General Kelly recently observed: \>T@he proximity of
the U.S. homeland to criminally governed spaces is a vulnerability with
direct implications for U.S. national security. I am also troubled by
the signi¿cant criminal capabilities that are available \>within them@
to anyone---for a price. Transnational criminal organizations have
access to key facilitators who specialize in document forgery,
trade-based money laundering, weapons procurement, and human smuggling,
including the smuggling of special interest aliens. This criminal
expertise and the ability to move people, products, and funds are skills
that can be exploited by a variety of malign actors, including
terrorists.78 Hezbollah and the Bolivarian Alliance Hezbollah in Latin
America 1on-state entities recognized by the U.S. as terrorist
organizations also operate in the region, most notably Lebanon-based
Hezbollah, an Iranian client group. Hezbollah maintains an active
presence in the tri-border area (TBA) of South America---the nexus of
Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay---stretching back to the 1980s. The TBA
has traditionally been under-governed and is known by some as "the
United 1ations of crime."79 Eight syndicate groups facilitate this
activity in South America's so-called "Southern Cone," overseeing
legitimate businesses along with a wide range of illegal activities to
include money laundering, drug and arms traf- ¿cking, identity theft and
false identi¿cation documents, counterfeiting currency and intellectual
property, and smuggling. 1ot surprisingly they are linked to organized
crime and to non-state insurgent and terrorist groups, such as the
FARC.80 Estimates are that over 12 billion in illicit transactions are
conducted per year, a sum exceeding Paraguay's entire GDP by a
substantial amount.81 Hezbollah achieved notoriety in the region in 1992
when it bombed the Israeli embassy in Argentina. This was followed with
the bombing of the AMIA Jewish community center in Buenos Aires two
years later. Like many other terrorist organizations, as Hezbollah
expanded it established relationships with drug cartels82 that it
supports in a variety of ways. For example, the cartels have enlisted
Hezbollah, known for its tunnel construction along the Israeli border,
for help in improving their tunnels along the U.S.-Mexican border. In
2008, Hezbollah helped broker a deal in which one of Mexico's major drug
cartels, Sinaloa, sent members to Iran for weapons and explosives
training via Venezuela using Venezuelan travel documents. 83 As the
locus of the drug trade and other illegal cartel activities moved north
into Central America and Mexico, Hezbollah has sought to move with it
with mixed success. In October 2011, Hezbollah was linked to the ĕorts
of an Iranian-American to conspire with Iranian agents to assassinate
the Saudi ambassador to the United States. The plot involved members of
the Los Zetas Mexican drug cartel.8The would-be assassin, Mansour
Arbabsiar, had established contact with his cousin, a Quds Force85
handler, Gen. Gholam Shakuri. The plot is believed by some to be part of
a wider campaign by the Quds Force and Hezbollah to embark on a campaign
of violence extending beyond the Middle East to other Western targets,
including those in the United States.86 In early September 2012, Mexican
authorities arrested three men suspected of operating a Hezbollah cell
in the Yucatan area and Central America, including a dual U.S.-Lebanese
citizen linked to a U.S.-based Hezbollah money laundering operation.87A
few months later, in December 2012, Wassim el Abd Fadel, a suspected
Hezbollah member with Paraguayan citizenship, was arrested in Paraguay.
Fadel was charged with human and drug trȧcking and money laundering.
Fadel reportedly deposited the proceeds of his criminal
activities---ranging from 50-200,000 per transaction---into Turkish and
Syrian bank accounts linked to Hezbollah.88 In summary, Hezbollah has
become a ¿xture in Central and Latin America, expanding both its
activities and inÀuence over time. It has developed links with the
increasingly powerful organized crime groups in the region, particularly
the narco cartels, along with radical insurgent groups such as the FARC
and states like Venezuela who are hostile to the United States and its
regional partners. Hezbollah's principal objectives appear to be
undermining U.S. inÀuence in the region, imposing costs on the United
States, and generating revenue to sustain its operations in Latin
America and elsewhere in the world. These objectives are shared by Iran,
Hezbollah's main state sponsor. The Bolivarian Alliance As noted above,
geographic, economic, and cultural factors have traditionally helped to
prevent the emergence in Latin America of any real military rival to the
United States. Although there are no traditional military threats in the
region, there are indigenous states whose actions, policies, and
rhetoric challenge regional stability and U.S. security. Over the past
decade, several states have come together to form the Bolivarian
Alliance of the Americas (ALBA), an organization of left-leaning Latin
American regimes whose overarching purpose is to promote radical
populism and socialism, foster regional integration, and reduce what
they perceive as Washington's "imperialist" influence in the region.89
Since its founding by Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and Fidel Castro of Cuba
in December 200, the Bolivarian Alliance has expanded to include Antigua
and Barbuda, Bolivia, Dominica, Ecuador, 1icaragua, and Saint Vincent
and the Grenadines. Although the members of the Bolivarian Alliance are
militarily weak and pose almost no traditional military threat to the
United States or its allies in the region,90 they challenge American
interests in the region in other ways. First, they espouse an
anti-American narrative that finds substantial support in the region and
consistently oppose U.S. efforts to foster cooperation and regional
economic integration.91 Second, in their efforts to undermine the
government of Colombia, which they consider to be a U.S. puppet, ALBA
states provide support and sanctuaries within their borders to coca
growers, drug traffickers, other criminal organizations, and the FARC.92
Links to Hezbollah have also been detected.93 Perhaps of greatest
concern, they have aligned themselves closely with Iran, inviting it and
Syria to participate as "observer states" in the alliance. Other
worrisome ALBA activities involve lifting visa requirements for Iranian
citizens and hosting large numbers of Iranian diplomats and commercial
exchange members that some observers believe to be Iranian intelligence
and paramilitary Quds Force operatives.9By hosting and cooperating with
both foreign agents and violent non-state actors, the ALBA states have
come to function as critical nodes in a network of groups hostile to the
United States. A Coming Era of Proxy Wars in the Western Hemisphere?
History shows that Washington has often emphasized an indirect approach
to meeting challenges to its security in Latin America. Yet the United
States has not shied away from more direct, traditional uses of force
when interests and circumstances dictated, as demonstrated over the past
half century by U.S. invasions of the Dominican Republic (1965), Grenada
(1983), and Panama (1989) and the occupation of Haiti (199).Yet several
trends seem likely to raise the cost of such operations, perhaps to
prohibitive levels. Foremost among these trends is the diffusion of
precision-guided weaponry to state and non-state entities. The Second
Lebanon War as "Precursor" War A precursor of this trend can be seen in
the Second Lebanon War between Israel and Hezbollah.95 During the
conÀict, which lasted less than ¿ve weeks, irregular Hezbollah forces
held their own against the highly regarded Israeli Defense Force (IDF),
demonstrating what is now possible for non-state entities to accomplish
given the proliferation of militarily-relevant advanced technologies.
Hezbollah's militia engaged IDF armor columns with salvos of advanced,
man-portable, antitank guided missiles and other ĕective anti-armor
weapons (e.g. rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) with anti-armor warheads)
in great numbers. When the IDF employed its ground forces in southern
Lebanon, its armored forces sŭered severe losses; out of the four
hundred tanks involved in the ¿ghting in southern Lebanon, forty-eight
were hit and forty damaged.96 Hezbollah's defensive line was also well
equipped with latest-generation thermal and low-/ no-light enhanced
illumination imaging systems, while frontline units were connected to
each other and higher command elements via a proprietary, ¿ber-optic
based communications network, making collection of communications trȧc
by Israeli intelligence extremely di̇cult. Perhaps most important,
Hezbollah possessed thousands of short- and medium-range rockets, often
skillfully hidden below ground or in bunkers that made detection from
overhead surveillance platforms nearly impossible. During the brief
conÀict Hezbollah's forces ¿red some four thousand unguided rockets of
various types that hit Israel. Hezbollah's rocket inventory enabled its
forces to attack targets throughout the northern half of Israel. Over
nine hundred rockets hit near or on buildings, civilian infrastructure,
and industrial plants. Some two thousand homes were destroyed, and over
¿fty Israelis died with several thousand more injured. The casualties
would undoubtedly been greater if between 100,000 and 250,000 Israeli
civilians had not Àed their homes. Haifa, Israel's major seaport had to
be shut down, as did its oil re¿nery.97 Hezbollah also employed several
unmanned aerial vehicles for surveillance of Israel, as well as C-802
anti-ship cruise missiles used to attack and damage an Israeli corvette.
98 The G-RAMM Battlefield The brief war between Israel and Hezbollah
suggests that future irregular forces may be well-equipped with enhanced
communications, extended-range surveillance capabilities, and
precision-guided rockets, artillery, mortars and missiles (G-RAMM) 99
able to hit targets with high accuracy at ranges measured from the tens
of kilometers perhaps up to a hundred kilometers or more. In projecting
power against enemies equipped in this manner and employing these kinds
of tactics U.S. forces---as well as other conventional forces---will
find themselves operating in a far more lethal battlefield than those in
either of the Gulf wars or in stability operations in Afghanistan and
Iraq. Moreover, currently constituted conventional forces typically
depend on large fixed infrastructure (e.g., military bases, logistics
depots, ports, airfields, railheads, bridges) to deploy themselves and
sustain combat operations. These transportation and support hubs also
serve as the nodes through which internal commerce and foreign trade
moves within a country. This key, fixed infrastructure will almost
certainly prove far more difficult to defend against irregular forces
armed with G-RAMM weaponry. Indeed, had Hezbollah's "RAMM" inventory had
only a small fraction of G-RAMM munitions, say 10-20 percent, it would
have been able to inÀict far greater damage than it did historically to
Israeli population centers, key government facilities, military
installations, and essential commercial assets such as ports, air¿elds,
and industrial complexes. An irregular enemy force armed with G-RAMM
capabilities in substantial numbers could seriously threaten Latin
American governments as well as any U.S. (or external great power)
forces and support elements attempting a traditional intervention
operation. Implications for the U.S. and Other Major Powers The
preceding narrative suggests that the combat potential of irregular
forces is likely to increase dramatically in the coming years. As this
occurs, the cost of operating conventional forces---especially ground
forces---and defending key military support infrastructure is likely to
rise substantially. Given these considerations the United States and
other major powers external to the Western Hemisphere will have strong
incentives to avoid the use of conventional forms of military power,
particularly large ground forces, in favor of employing irregular proxy
forces to advance their interests. Moreover, the high cost and
questionable bene¿t of the campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq are likely
to create strong domestic opposition in the United States to such
operations for some time to come. This must be added to the United
States' greatly diminished ¿scal standing that has led to large cuts in
planned investments in defense. These factors suggest that Washington
will be much less likely to engage in direct military action in Latin
America in the coming years than historically has been the case. At the
same time, rivals of the United States like China and Russia may be
incentivized by these trends, as well as the United States' overwhelming
military dominance in the Western Hemisphere, to avoid the direct use of
force to expand their inÀuence in Latin America. Instead, like some of
the Bolivarian Alliance members, they appear likely to follow the path
taken by the Soviet Union during the Cold War and Iran today: supporting
non-state proxies to impose disproportionate costs on the United States
and to distract Washington's resources and attention from other parts of
the world. This is not to say that Beijing, Moscow, and Tehran would
eschew future opportunities to establish bases in Latin America. As in
the past, such bases can support ĕorts to accomplish several important
objectives. They can, for example, further insulate a Latin American
regime from the threat of direct U.S. military intervention, since
Washington would have to account for the possibility that the
[[**conflict** would lead to a **direct confrontation** with
a]{.underline}]{.mark} more capable and potentially [[**nuclear-armed
power**.]{.underline}]{.mark}100 Bases in the hemisphere can also enable
external powers to conduct military assistance activities, such as
training, more easily. Electronic surveillance of the United States and
Latin American states could be accomplished more cheaply and ĕectively
from forward positions. Finally, certain kinds of military capabilities,
such as long-range ballistic missiles and attack submarines, could be
pro¿tably stationed in Latin America by powers external to that region,
particularly if they intended to create the option of initiating conÀict
at some future date. These reasons, among others, have made preventing
an extra-hemispheric power from establishing bases in Latin America an
enduring U.S. priority. Players in a Latin American Great Game Given
current trends, several powers external to the region may, either now or
over the coming decade, have both the motive and the means to employ
both state and non-state proxies in Latin American to achieve their
interests. Principal among them is Iran, which is already engaged in
supporting proxies against the United States and its partners in the
Middle East and has long been developing proxies in Latin America.
Additionally, there are reasons to think that China and Russia may be
interested in cultivating and supporting Latin American proxies as well.

#### Mexican [recession]{.underline} turns the United States\-\--Exports, Supply Chains, Interdependence

[[Mexico]{.mark} today [is]{.mark}]{.underline} one of the world's most
open economies, the thirteenth largest by GDP, and [[the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tate[[s'
third **largest trading partner**]{.mark}.]{.underline} While many
Americans associate Mexico with words like "drugs," "violence,"
"immigrants," or maybe "Cancun," the truth is that [the US economy is
**inextricably linked** to Mexico's]{.underline}, and vice versa:
[economic, civil, social, or political **[unrest on one country greatly
affects the other]{.mark}**, both directly and indirectly]{.underline}.
The aim of this three-part blog series is to look at the bigger picture:
Mexico is far more important to the US, and the US to Mexico, than
conventional wisdom suggests --- and in many more ways. A recent New
York Times article discusses the importance of Mexico's rapidly
approaching presidential elections to the state of Texas. However, these
elections will affect more than just the border states. [The economies
of [more **than a dozen**]{.mark} **other
[states]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including Nebraska, Iowa, and Michigan
[[depend]{.mark} **heavily [on exports to Mexico]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Mexican companies are now the largest suppliers of cement, baked goods,
and dairy products to the US market. [[Mexico is]{.mark} also [the
**second largest supplier** of **oil to the US**]{.mark}]{.underline},
after Canada. In addition to providing each other with important export
markets, [[the]{.mark} Mexican and US [economies are]{.mark} **becoming
increasingly [integrated]{.mark}** [in ways that blur **traditional
understandings** of trade]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [regional [**supply
chains** of US companies]{.mark} **criss-[cross the]{.mark} US-Mexico**
[border]{.mark}]{.underline}, meaning that Mexico and the US work
together to manufacture goods that are eventually sold on the global
market. For example, cars built in North America may cross the border as
many as eight times as they are being produced. In other words, the US
and Mexico are more than just neighbors. [Economic
**[interdependence]{.mark}**, shared cultural heritage, [and]{.mark}
**grim [security]{.mark} [issues]{.mark}** that both countries must face
together [mean that what **happens in Mexico affects the
US**]{.mark}]{.underline} in more ways than just immigration and drug
trafficking. [[Mexico's economic, political]{.mark}, institutional,
social, [and security challenges are **all
interconnected**]{.mark}]{.underline}: whoever wins the Mexican
presidential elections on July 1 will have to face a myriad of complex
problems. He or she will help set policies that will both directly and
indirectly affect everyone from US business leaders to migrant workers
to white suburban teenagers. A Mexico that is fully equipped with
leaders who can help navigate the process to the reforms the country
needs is an even more important economic and political ally that can
help increase prosperity throughout the region. This is not a zero-sum
game. **[[If Mexico flourishes, the US will also
flourish]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Institution\'s Metropolitan Policy Program where he conducts research on

on the NAFTA supply chain," March 30, 2017.
https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2017/03/30/how-u-s-states-rely-on-the-nafta-supply-chain//jtsang

Earlier this week, the U.S. Trade Representative's office sent a draft
letter to Congressional leaders outlining the Trump administration's
objectives for a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA).

For companies, cities, and states reliant on North American trade, the
stakes of a NAFTA renegotiation are potentially high. In January, my
colleague Mark Muro and I explored how changing trade policy may
influence U.S. metropolitan economies. [Because Canada and Mexico are
the nation's two largest export markets, changes to NAFTA could matter
greatly to these metros.]{.underline} In fact, the United States trades
as much with Canada and Mexico as it does with Japan, Korea, and the
BRICS---Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa---combined.
Millions of jobs in U.S. states depend on exports to Canada and Mexico.
A recent analysis in The Economist finds that introducing higher tariffs
or new border taxes for Mexican trade as part of a NAFTA renegotiation
would particularly impact states like Texas and Michigan, where exports
south of the border account for a large share of the economy.

Simply looking at how changes to NAFTA would affect state-level exports
to Canada and Mexico misses the complexity and distinctiveness of North
American trade. Beyond just using Canada and Mexico as export markets
for final goods, many U.S. firms (and by extension, the states in which
they operate) depend on supply chains that link their U.S.-based
operations with suppliers in Canada and Mexico. [As a result, much
[North American trade occurs in "intermediate goods"---]{.mark}materials
or components that companies import [and integrate into the production
of a final good.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Why intermediate goods imports matter

Intermediate imports matter. At first glance, the benefits of imports to
a state may seem counterintuitive. [Sourcing [imports internationally
can result in higher transportation costs for firms, increase the risk
of supply-chain disruptions, and displace domestic production and
jobs]{.mark}.]{.underline} As we have argued, the country undoubtedly
needs a more comprehensive suite of policies that help workers and
communities adjust to rising import competition. Yet, evidence suggests
that sourcing intermediate goods internationally also improves product
quality and lowers product cost, making a firm's products more
competitive in the global marketplace and ultimately supporting jobs and
wages at home.

[Companies, cities, and states must import to compete in today's
integrated economy. [The United States **depends on intermediate goods
imports from its North American neighbors more than from other parts of
the world.**]{.mark}]{.underline} In 2015, intermediate goods imports
accounted for 43 percent of total U.S. goods imports. From Canada and
Mexico, the share was 50 percent, much higher than the European Union
(37 percent) or China (28 percent).

State dependence on NAFTA intermediate imports varies

Every state imports intermediate goods from Canada and Mexico, but the
volume of those imports varies depending on industry makeup and
geographic location. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau on state-level
imports, classified by the United Nations' definition of intermediate
goods, provides a unique look at which state economies rely most on
intermediate imports from Canada and Mexico, and are therefore most
exposed to changes in NAFTA.

[[When measured by total volume, the nation's largest states dominate
intermediate goods imports]{.mark} from North America. Texas, Illinois,
Michigan, New York, Ohio, and Washington all import more than \$15
billion in intermediate goods, [together accounting for over half of the
nation's total]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Given the large size of their
economies, disruptions to trade in these states have significant
potential to influence national economic growth.]{.underline}]{.mark}

However, some states' production relies more on NAFTA imports, measured
by the share of total intermediate goods imports that come from Canada
and Mexico. Table 1 ranks states based on this metric.

The states that rely most on NAFTA intermediate imports as a share of
their total import base tend to be involved in one of two broad sectors:
advanced manufacturing and energy.

Advanced manufacturing

[[**Advanced manufacturing in many states greatly depends on
intermediate imports** from]{.mark} Canada and [Mexico. Michigan's
automotive industry has long relied on suppliers]{.mark}]{.underline} in
Canada and Mexico who provide 61 percent of Michigan's total
intermediate imports. [Tens of billions of dollars' worth of motor
vehicle seats, ignitions, wires, and other parts flow into southeast
Michigan to support local production.]{.underline} Beyond Michigan,
North American supply chain relationships extend to the remainder of the
industrial Midwest. Canada and Mexico supply Ohio with nearly \$3
billion worth of automotive parts and Indiana with over \$2 billion. As
the auto belt has shifted south, so too has the North American supply
chain. Texas imports nearly \$6 billion in auto parts from Mexico alone.
Tennessee imports over \$2 billion in motor vehicle parts from North
America while Kentucky imports nearly \$1.6 billion.

[[North America]{.mark}'s most prominent shared industry is automotive
manufacturing, but it also [supports a burgeoning aerospace supply
chain]{.mark}. Washington---led by the Seattle-Tacoma
area]{.underline}---imports more than \$1 billion annually from Canadian
aerospace suppliers. Kansas---where aerospace manufacturing anchors the
Wichita metro economy---receives at least \$700 million annually in
North American-sourced aircraft component parts. Arizona imports nearly
\$300 million worth of turbojets and turbopropellers from Mexico to
supply its aerospace manufacturing base. In 2016, U.S. aerospace exports
totaled nearly \$147 billion overall.

Energy

[Energy is the second major U.S. sector that relies on NAFTA
intermediate imports. [The United States is a major importer of crude
oil from]{.mark} Canada, and to a lesser extent,
[Mexico]{.mark}.]{.underline} In 16 states---including Illinois, Texas,
Minnesota, Oklahoma, Washington, Montana, and Colorado---crude oil is
the largest intermediate good import from North America. Pipelines carry
oil from Alberta into the northern and western United States where it is
refined and sent into markets throughout the west. Further south,
[[Mexican petroleum ships through the Gulf of Mexico to major refining
and chemical manufacturing hubs]{.mark} in Louisiana, Mississippi, and
Texas.]{.underline} Even as domestic energy production has expanded in
recent years, U.S. states continue to rely on North American partners to
create the basic inputs to everything from plastics to chemicals.

Second, [politics need to remain at the forefront of analysis.
If,]{.underline} as Clausewitz famously said, [war is the continuation
of politics by other means, then **an analysis of the tools of war needs
to account for the political decision-making and political context
surrounding arms transfers**]{.underline}. Put more crudely, weapons
don't make war; people do. [It is deeply puzzling, and ethically
troubling, that analyses of the relationship between arms transfers and
conflict do not account for state goals, leaders' opinions, or other
international or domestic processes that affect decisions to go to
war]{.underline}. War is a decision, not the inevitable outcome of an
(im)balance in military power.

#### NAFTA 2.0 eliminates ISD attacks that greenlight corporations' environmental destruction

**Wallach 2018**

Lori Wallach is the director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch.
"The Battle Over NAFTA 2.0 Has Just Begun" December 21, 2018
https://www.thenation.com/article/nafta-congress-2019///dmr

On the upside, **[NAFTA's outrageous investor privileges and ISDS
tribunals are dramatically reined in under NAFTA 2.0]{.underline}**,
[after hundreds of millions in taxpayer funds have been paid to
corporations using the regime to attack public-interest
policies]{.underline}. The new text terminates ISDS tribunals between
the United States and Canada, which will prevent significant future
damage. Most ISDS cases under NAFTA have involved US or Canadian
corporations attacking the Canadian or US government, and all but one of
the ISDS payouts over environmental issues involved US firms challenging
Canadian policies. For Mexico, ISDS is replaced by a new approach:
[Whereas ISDS allows investors to skirt domestic courts, the new process
requires investors to use such courts to resolve disputes with a
government until the highest available domestic court
rules]{.underline}, or until two and a half years pass with no
resolution. In the latter case, an investor can seek compensation---but
only for limited claims in which "an investment is nationalized or
otherwise directly expropriated through formal transfer of title or
outright seizure," or for discriminatory government actions against an
established investment. **[The five other investor protections in NAFTA
that have resulted in almost all payouts so far are eliminated in the
new agreement]{.underline}**. These are also the protections that made
it cheaper and less risky to outsource US jobs to Mexico. Additionally,
[**NAFTA 2.0 eliminates the "right to invest," which companies use to
launch ISDS attacks if a government refuses to authorize an
environmentally damaging mine or other proposed
investment**.]{.underline} The new text also includes important
procedural reforms. Those reviewing claims under NAFTA 2.0 cannot
simultaneously represent corporations suing governments, which is not
the case under the ISDS process. Also, investors can only be compensated
for losses they can prove, with "inherently speculative" damages banned;
previously, investors have obtained huge sums premised on their claims
that expected future profits would be lost. These changes don't go into
effect until three years after NAFTA 2.0 does. But this vexing delay did
not stop the Business Roundtable, the American Enterprise Institute, and
the Wall Street Journal editorial board from criticizing the gutting of
ISDS---nor did a loophole under NAFTA 2.0 designed to protect nine US
companies if their contracts with Mexico's National Hydrocarbons
Commission are canceled without cause. These companies retain the
broader ISDS rights if Mexico maintains agreements that provide such
rights to investors from other countries. While none of the companies
have used ISDS against Mexico, several have against other countries.
Preserving access to broad ISDS rights for any corporation, much less
oil companies, is bad. Yet even with these flaws, **[NAFTA 2.0 delivers
a significant scaling-back of investor power over
governments]{.underline}**. If an administration as compliant to
corporations as Trump's is whacking ISDS, it will be hard for future
presidents to backslide. **[The move also sends a powerful signal to the
many nations worldwide that are seeking to escape the ISDS
regime.]{.underline}**

#### USMCA requires maintenance of protections on a wide variety of environmental areas, especially protection of the ozone layer -- ensures vigorous monitoring and enforcement

**[Interlocutors from all three parties of the]{.underline}**
U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement **[(USMCA)]{.underline}** on Friday
**[highlighted the pact's labor and environmental provisions as
groundbreaking,]{.underline}** as the Democrat-controlled House is
expected to closely scrutinize that language in forthcoming implementing
legislation. ["Whether it's illegal timber or ozone depletion, the
substantive standards on environment and labor are nothing like we've
ever seen before,"]{.underline} Colin Bird, minister-counselor for trade
and economic policy at the Embassy of Canada in Washington, said during
a trade conference. [USMCA would require each party to treat intentional
transnational trafficking of wildlife protected under its laws as a
crime constituting an offense punishable by at least four
years']{.underline} "deprivation of liberty" or a more serious penalty,
as defined by the UN Convention on Transnational Organized Crime. [The
agreement also would **require parties to cooperate in addressing
matters of mutual interest related to ozone-depleting substances**,
including exchanging information and experience in areas such as
environmentally friendly alternatives to ozone-depleting substances;
refrigerant management practices, policies and programs; and combating
illegal trade in ozone-depleting substances.]{.underline} Also, "in a
way that is rarely seen," USMCA strives to make sure the benefits of the
agreement are widely shared, including through automotive rules of
origin that incentivize raising of Mexican wages, Bird said during the
Georgetown University Law Center 2019 International Trade Update.
Kenneth Smith Ramos, who was Mexico's chief negotiator for the USMCA and
now works in the private sector, said the deal's labor chapter is the
strongest and most advanced labor chapter in any free trade agreement
and reflects the types of labor reform being discussed in Mexican
Congress, including strengthening collective bargaining rights. "I
believe that it will be part of the discussion, of course, from groups
in the United States and probably \[lawmakers\] who, in all fairness,
would not vote for a trade agreement anyway but are using it as leverage
for other things that could be even of a domestic nature," he said. "But
we are very satisfied with the result obtained in the labor chapter
negotiations." [Also, making labor and environment provisions subject to
the same dispute settlement mechanisms as other chapters adds "teeth" to
those provisions, Ramos said.]{.underline} Noting USMCA's labor and
environment provisions, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for the
Western Hemisphere John Melle said Mexico is in the process of
"overhauling" its justice system so workers have the right to secret
ballot votes and challenging union leadership and that [USMCA
environment provisions combat trafficking in wildlife, timber and fish
and address ocean litter, among other things. **"And unlike NAFTA, these
provisions are fully enforceable in the core of the agreement, and
coupled with robust monitoring and enforcement
provisions**]{.underline}, will create fairer competition among North
American workers," said Melle, who was the United States' chief USMCA
negotiator.

The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is set to
replace NAFTA, concluded on September 30, 2018. [Chapter 24 of this
trilateral trade deal sets out the framework for environmental issues
between the parties.]{.underline} Here is a high-level summary of this
chapter. [Chapter 24 puts an emphasis on USMCA parties cooperating to
protect and conserve the environment. **It requires each country to
maintain an environmental impact assessment process that covers issues
related to protecting the ozone layer, protecting the marine environment
from ship pollution, improving air quality, preventing the loss of
biodiversity, preventing, detecting and controlling invasive alien
species, protecting and conserving marine species as well as promoting
sustainable forest management**.]{.underline} There is no mention of
climate change in this chapter. [It also notably takes into
consideration the constitutional rights of indigenous people, addresses
the important economic, social and cultural role that the environment
plays in their lives and recognizes the importance of consulting with
them on efforts to enhance the long-term protection of the
environment.]{.underline} Some of the other notable provisions in the
USMCA are mentioned below. [Environmental Goods and Services: The
parties have agreed it is important to **trade and invest in
environmental goods** and services, **including clean technologies
spurring potential growth** in this important sector. Ocean and
Fisheries Issues: There are many provisions dealing with fisheries
management that relate to **overfishing, fish stock health, conservation
and protection of marine species and marine litter**. Corporate Social
Responsibility: The parties have agreed to promote corporate social
responsibility and responsible business conduct within their borders by

Late Sunday night, the Trump Administration and Canada agreed on a deal

environmental quality," said Colares on the 1994 NAFTA deal. ["Now
there's more of an engagement of conversation between the three

U.S., Canada, and Mexico to implement a fisheries management system that
"must include the control, reduction, and eventual elimination of all
subsidies that contribute to overfishing and overcapacity."]{.underline}
According to Colares, [the document features stronger language on how
the countries will work together to set similar environmental standards
in an effort to prevent jobs from moving to countries with less
stringent environmental regulations]{.underline}. **["The new agreement
\-- the USMCA \-- specifically has language providing that countries
will not use lower standards as a way to attract
business,"]{.underline}** said Colares. In a written statement,
Democratic Congressman Tim Ryan said he will be reviewing the text to
ensure labor and environmental standards are enforced. Both Republican
Senator Rob Portman and Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown praised
progress on the agreement but said they will be reviewing the details.
It must be approved by Congress.

### Won't Pass 2ac

#### Won't pass -- number of thumpers, 2020 elections, spending bills, demands to reopen negotiations 

**Ferrechio 7/05** - Susan Ferrechio ("Trade deal hits summer doldrums",
Washington Examiner, 7/05/2019,
https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/trade-deal-hits-summer-doldrums)//AA

The Trump administration's hopes for a summer ratification of the United
States--Mexico--Canada Agreement are beginning to fade as it becomes
increasingly likely that the trade deal will not advance in Congress
until 2021. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has the power to slow-walk a vote
on the trade agreement. She has chosen to exercise that power, citing a
trio of unresolved "deal breaker" problems Democrats want addressed. The
California Democrat believes that the deal, as written, lacks adequate
mechanisms to enforce its labor and environmental provisions and
includes language that could increase prescription drug prices. The
speaker has met with President Trump's trade representative, Robert
Lighthizer, and received an in-person prodding from Canadian Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau when he visited the Capitol June 20, but
[[Pelosi is not rushing to bring the pact to the]{.mark} House floor for
a [vote.]{.mark} Pelosi could bring up the USMCA for a vote this month,
but that's looking increasingly unlikely.]{.underline} Pelosi signaled
to reporters before leaving for the July Fourth recess that she is in no
hurry. "What [the schedule is]{.underline}, is [when we come to an
agreement]{.underline}. So engineer back from that, whenever that is,"
Pelosi said, when asked about the timing of a vote. The statement is an
ominous sign for those who were hoping the USMCA would win the approval
of Congress this summer. Republicans and the [Trump]{.underline}
administration are [eager to activate the trade deal]{.underline}, which
they argue [would significantly increase jobs and grow the economy. [At
this point, the deal may not even be ratified before the 2020
presidential election. The House and Senate will adjourn for the entire
month of August. When they return, they'll be consumed by spending bills
ahead of a Sept. 30 fiscal year deadline. After that comes the
presidential campaign]{.mark}]{.underline}, when Congress tends to avoid
substantive legislating. [[Pelosi has refused to back down on her demand
that the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [reopen the agreement to
include]{.mark}]{.underline}, at the very least, [[enforcement
provisions for labor and environmental standards. She has
rejected]{.underline}]{.mark} plans to simply add enforcement language
in so-called [[side letters]{.underline}]{.mark} to the deal, which are
only marginally enforceable. "[We don't have enforcement if it's in a
letter, a side bar, a law in our country]{.underline}, your country, his
country, [but not in the agreement]{.underline}," Pelosi said. She
called for a ["surgical" reopening of the agreement "for the singular
purpose of doing enforcement."]{.underline}

#### Reopening kills the deal -- 2020 pressure

**Oberoi 7/08** -- Mohit Oberoi ("Why USMCA Ratification Is Crucial for
President Trump", Market Realist, 7/08/2019,
https://marketrealist.com/2019/07/why-usmca-ratification-is-crucial-for-president-trump/)//AA

Where is the problem? In simple terms, [[Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark}
[want]{.mark} an even [more favorable trade deal than the USMCA in its
present form]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House
of Representatives, said, "We do not want to pass this agreement just
slightly different from NAFTA with a little sugar on top and say, 'See,
we did something different.'" Another thing to consider would be that
Trump's rapport with Democrats as well as Congress has been far from
good. The President has liberally employed rarely used laws to bypass
Congress. Last year, Trump invoked national security laws to impose
steel and aluminum tariffs. US steel companies like U.S. Steel (X) and
AK Steel (AKS) raised steel prices after the steel tariffs were imposed
last year. However, [US steel prices, as well as the stock price of U.S.
Steel and AK Steel, have plunged over the last 16 months despite the
tariffs in place]{.underline}. A similar probe was carried out by the
Commerce Department into automotive imports whose findings are currently
with Trump. Earlier this year, Trump declared a national emergency when
he failed to convince Democrats for border wall funding. In Huawei's
case also, Trump used national security laws to limit the company's
ability to do business with US companies without prior approval. What to
expect While [Democrats would push for a better deal, [it will be
**tough for**]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**
administration **[[to go back to the drawing
board]{.underline}]{.mark}** for two reasons. First, **[[Mexico has
already ratified USMCA]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and secondly, [[with
**the 2020 elections looming, Trump might not want to renegotiate
USMCA**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It's worth noting that [Trump had to grant
Section 232 steel and aluminum tariff exemptions for Canada and Mexico
before Mexico ratified USMCA]{.underline}. Both Canada and Mexico were
persistent in their demand for Section 232 exemption despite opposition
from President Trump. [[If the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[St]{.mark}ates [seeks more concessions from Canada and Mexico, it will
likely lead to counter demands]{.mark}]{.underline} from these countries
also and lead to lengthy discussions, **[[ruling out chances for

One of President Donald Trump's top trade priorities upon entering
office was renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Renegotiations eventually went through, despite some typical threats and
taunts from Trump along the way about tearing up or withdrawing from the
existing deal. Along with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and
former Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump signed the revised
pact, now dubbed the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, more than
seven months ago. Mexico's Congress ratified the deal in June---by an
overwhelming vote of 114-4---while Canada has taken steps to do so
before its parliamentary elections this fall. But [[can Trump]{.mark}
and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer [convince enough
Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark} in Congress to vote for it---[without losing
even more Republican support]{.mark}---to get the new agreement over the
line in Washington?]{.underline} So far, [[Lighthizer has promised to
work with congressional Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark}]{.underline} to
satisfy their concerns over enforcement, labor standards and

specifics]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}, of course,
[[could blow things up at any moment by reviving his threats to impose

tariffs on something else.]{.underline} [The administration's stated
goal]{.underline}---for the U.S. to formally ratify the USMCA this
summer, before Congress' August recess, and before the presidential
campaign enters full swing---[is still theoretically possible, but [the
number of legislative days left is shrinking fast.]{.mark}]{.underline}
In late May, the administration submitted to Congress a draft statement
of administrative action required to implement the agreement. Thirty
days have passed since then, so the White House can now submit
implementing legislation to Congress any time it chooses.

### Thumper -- Debt Ceiling

#### Debt ceiling thumps ---so many things could go wrong

**Ferris 19** (Sarah, budget and appropriations reporter, *Politico,*
"Congress fears Trump could stumble over next fiscal cliff," published
April 2^nd^, 2019,
<https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/02/congress-spending-budget-shutdown-1244283>,
accessed 7/10/19, JME.)

A looming battle between President Donald Trump and Democrats over
government spending and the debt limit could make the 35-day government
shutdown look like a blip. [[A series of budget deadlines converge in
the coming months]{.mark} that could leave Washington on the precipice
of another shutdown, \$100 billion in automatic spending cuts and a
full-scale credit crisis.]{.underline} And lawmakers are openly worried
about stumbling over the edge. "**[It could all go terribly
wrong]{.underline}**," House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth
(D-Ky.) said. Some top Democrats have begun quietly pushing for a grand
bargain to simultaneously raise the debt ceiling and Congress' stiff
budget caps --- avoiding market turmoil and staving off harsh cuts to
domestic and defense programs, according to multiple lawmakers and
aides. But [[the White House]{.underline}]{.mark}, focused on Trump's
reelection bid[, is resisting talk of another massive deal]{.underline}
that could cost as much as \$350 billion over two years. [Administration
officials]{.underline}, led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin,
[are]{.underline} instead [[pushing for a "clean" debt ceiling
hike]{.underline}]{.mark} that extends the federal borrowing limit
without making any other policy changes. [[The fiscal fights will reach
a boiling point this fall]{.mark} --- around the same time that Congress
must pass its annual funding bills, which is [guaranteed to dredge up
the]{.mark} same [border wall fight]{.mark} between Trump and Democrats
that sent the government sputtering into a five-week
shutdown]{.underline}. By September, [lawmakers could be faced with a
fiscal cliff rivaling that of 2011]{.underline}, when another divided
government nearly defaulted on its debt. "This is the Congress of the
United States. Of course there will be a cliff," said a senior
Republican lawmaker involved with the budget negotiations. The conflict
is still at arm's length for most of Washington. Talks between House and
Senate leaders have only just begun, and while there\'s some hope that a
deal could come together as soon as this spring, [neither party has
finalized its strategy]{.underline}. Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell and Speaker Nancy Pelosi are confident they can avert a
doomsday scenario in which the U.S. government fails to pay its bills
for the first time in history, according to lawmakers and aides. [Senate
Republicans eager to defend their majority in 2020 will be in no mood
for any shenanigans surrounding the debt limit]{.underline}. Officials
in both parties say they're committed to reaching a deal to avoid
sequestration and lift the budget caps. Without a bipartisan agreement,
the Pentagon would be forced to slash \$71 billion from the next fiscal
year's budget, with an additional \$55 billion cut from domestic
programs. **[The White House]{.underline}**, however, **[isn't on
board]{.underline}**. "We've been saying that we should move beyond
these unaffordable, dollar-for-dollar caps deals that hold defense
spending ransom to billions of dollars in wasteful discretionary
spending," a senior administration official said. And [[with an erratic
Trump still demanding money for his]{.mark} southern [border
wall]{.mark} and angry about accepting a previous deal to boost
spending]{.underline}, some [lawmakers fear how the White House will
handle such a fraught moment]{.underline}. "My biggest concern is that
there are irrational people who are willing to risk the country's
financial status for hyperbolic gain and that there are folks out there
who've forgotten compromise." Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.), an
Appropriations Committee member, said in an interview. The first key
question for Democrats and Republicans is whether to try to strike a
deal that would lift the debt ceiling and budget caps at the same time.
Entangling the two --- in theory --- would offer just enough incentive
for both parties to hold their noses and ink the deal. "That's what
deals are for --- to put some things in that one side doesn\'t love and
some things that the other side doesn\'t love," said Rep. Debbie
Wasserman Schultz, a top Democratic spending negotiator. "Sweeteners and
bitter pills for both --- and hope that we get there." A broader accord
could also relieve some pressure on party leaders in both the House and
Senate. Republicans, for instance, would be hard-pressed to vote against
boosting the Pentagon budget, while Democrats rarely, if ever, vote
against raising the debt limit. That could deliver just enough votes for
an otherwise unpopular budget deal --- expected to total as much as
\$350 billion over two years, aides say --- that will inevitably become
a partisan battle over funding in the first full year of a Democratic
House and Republican Senate. [House Majority Leader]{.underline} Steny
[Hoyer has told]{.underline} other [Democratic leaders that they should
not rule out a broader deal.]{.underline} "It should remain an option to
do them together and remove two major drivers of uncertainty at the same
time before that uncertainty metastasizes," a Democratic aide said of
his thinking. [But the tactic could also backfire.
Democrats]{.underline} say they [can't rule out the possibility that
Trump would deploy the same "shoot-the-hostage" strategy that he did
during the border fight, when he embraced the shutdown as a nod to his
conservative base even after Congress refused to fund the
wall]{.underline}.

#### Yes thumper---past fiscal dysfunction proves a fight is coming **Bryan 19 (Bob, commentary editor, previously a markets reporter, *Business Insider,* "The US just officially hit the debt ceiling, setting up another high-stakes showdown for the fall," published March 2^nd^, 2019, https://www.businessinsider.com/author/bob-bryan, accessed 7/10/19, JME.)**

As of Saturday, the US has officially hit the debt ceiling, capping the
national debt at just over \$22 trillion. And while the deadline to
raise the ceiling is still a few months away, analysts are already
worried about a fight that could get ugly. Congress suspended the debt
ceiling for a year in February 2018, which allowed the US to rack up new
debt until the limit was reimposed on March 2. While the country can\'t
add to the debt load until the ceiling is either raised or suspended by
Congress, the Treasury Department can use its \"extraordinary measures\"
to move funds around and prevent a breach of the ceiling for a few more
months. According to a report released on Tuesday by the Congressional
Budget Office, [[the Treasury will exhaust the ability to extend the
deadline]{.mark} until sometime in late September or early
October]{.underline}. The exact date is uncertain this far out because
of the variability of tax receipts and potential federal spending.
[Raising the debt ceiling is a critical function of Congress because a
failure to do so would mean that the US is likely to default on some of
its debt.]{.underline} Such an event would almost certainly lead to a
credit-rating downgrade for the US, a major stock-market sell-off, and
disastrous ramifications for the global economy. [But even with the
economic implications, [fights over the debt ceiling have become
**increasingly politicized**]{.mark}]{.underline} in recent years, [and
[the difficulty of getting a deal done during the
recen]{.mark}t]{.underline} 35-day government [[shutdown
has]{.mark}]{.underline} some [[analysts worried]{.mark}]{.underline}
that [Congress and]{.underline} President Donald [Trump may not be able
to reach a deal in time]{.underline}. \"After the longest government
shutdown in American history[, it is irresponsible not to see a
read-through for broader]{.underline} 2019 and 2020 [**fiscal
dysfunction** with the mother-of-all \'must pass\' bills coming into
focus when the US hits its head on the debt ceiling this
Friday]{.underline},\" Chris Krueger, a policy strategist at Cowen
Washington Research Group, wrote in a note to clients. In previous
debt-ceiling fights, [deficit hawks]{.underline} --- especially those in
the Republican Party --- [have demanded spending cuts to accompany the
ceiling increase.]{.underline} And in more recent years, the
[debt-ceiling fights have become entangled in various issues, such
as]{.underline} securing funding for [Trump\'s wall]{.underline} along
the US-Mexico border. [[Further complicating things is that the timing
of the debt-ceiling-breach date will match up with the next round of
negotiations on government funding]{.underline}]{.mark}. But for now,
Trump administration officials seem to be putting a positive spin on
things. Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of
Economic Advisers, told CNN that the administration hopes negotiations
won\'t come down to the wire. \"Everybody hopes we can work together and
make a positive deal and that it won\'t come to that,\" Hassett said.

#### Fight is inevitable

**Golshan 6/13** (Tara, politics reporter, *Vox News,* "Congress's
high-stakes budget fight to avert an economic crisis, explained,"
published June 13^th^, 2019,
<https://www.vox.com/2019/5/22/18635564/congress-budget-caps-debt-limit-trump>,
accessed 7/10/19, JME.)

The question is where to start. [The White House's fiscal
hawks]{.underline} --- like acting budget chief Russ Vought and Mulvaney
--- [have been pushing to raise the debt ceiling without a deal on
budget caps]{.underline}. After surpassing the debt limit in March, the
Treasury Department has implemented extraordinary measures to keep up
with loan payments, like suspending investments in programs like the
Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund and the Postal Service
Retiree Health Benefits Fund. Those measures are only expected to hold
up until this fall, at which point budget experts warn the United States
could create a global financial crisis by defaulting on payments. It
makes sense that the White House wants to get the debt ceiling done
first, to lessen Democrats' leverage over budget caps negotiations.
Pelosi made clear that's not going to happen, saying the two either have
to come simultaneously or the budget caps deal must come first. Even
McConnell reportedly told Vought and Mulvaney that their demand was
politically infeasible. But that said, [[the White House is full of
agitators,]{.mark} from the budget director to the president. This year
started with the longest government shutdown in US history, after Trump
refused for more than a month to sign a spending bill without funding
for his border wal]{.underline}l. Eventually he caved, but [the
shutdown]{.underline}, and the toll it took on the government, [remains
a major factor in how Congress is approaching spending negotiations
going forward.]{.underline} The longer it takes to reach a deal on
budget caps, the more Congress will have to rush its debate over funding
everything from border security to disaster relief funding. [[Until
Congress and the White House can agree on budget caps, some of
Congress's biggest spending fights are on hold]{.mark}.]{.underline}

session before the August recess, House Democrats from across the
spectrum are demanding that the trade pact with Mexico and Canada be
renegotiated]{.underline}, citing concerns with the implications for
labor and environmental standards as well as drug prices. The Trump
administration has been pushing for approval of the deal, known as the
U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), by August due to concerns that the
2020 presidential campaign will make it politically impossible to
complete the deal this fall. [Congress will also have to deal with
avoiding a government shutdown and debt default after returning to
Washington on Sept. 9 from the monthlong summer recess]{.underline}. But
[House Democrats say that the idea of getting the trade deal done by the
end of the summer session is]{.underline} all but [out of
reach.]{.underline} "I don\'t see how that happens in three weeks," said
Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), chairman of the House Ways and Means
trade subcommittee. As for the Trump administration's push to get the
trade pact through Congress by August, "That\'s their problem. We\'ve
told them what our interests are," Blumenauer said. [House
Democrats]{.underline} insist that they do want to get the USMCA done,
but [aren\'t holding themselves to a deadline]{.underline}.

[The White House plans to send its replacement for the North American
Free Trade Agreement to Congress after Sept. 1, **setting up a vote by
the end of the year**]{.underline}, sources told CNBC. The White House
could submit the bill to Congress as soon as this week to start the
approval process. House Democrats are meeting in working groups to
hammer out issues with the existing agreement. But [the White House and
Office of the U.S. Trade Representative disagree over how aggressive a
strategy to pursue in getting the deal through Congress]{.underline}, a
senior administration official and two senior GOP aides said. President
Donald Trump's acting chief of staff Mick [Mulvaney and]{.underline}
Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff Marc [Short want to pressure
majority House Democrats with a deadline so they cannot run out the
clock on ratifying the dea]{.underline}l. U.S. Trade Representative
Robert [Lighthizer has suggested]{.underline} that [giving Democrats
more time to consider it. Despite those differences, the White House and
USTR agree the Trump administration could benefit from another month to
sell the deal to members of Congress unsure about supporting
it.]{.underline} Both White House camps also worry history could repeat
itself. In 2007, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suspended the "fast-track"
timeline indefinitely for the House to vote on a free-trade deal with
Colombia, after President George W. Bush sent the agreement to Congress
without her blessing. The standoff lasted nearly five years, with the
deal passing after it was renegotiated under President Barack Obama. "At
the time, no President had sent an FTA under fast track rules where a
speaker was opposed, so we didn't know how Speaker Pelosi would react,"
said Tim Keeler, an attorney at Mayer Brown who was chief of staff to
then-U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab. "Today, the Trump
administration has the benefit of that hindsight." On May 30, Lighthizer
initiated an early procedural move toward securing a vote, by sending a
"Statement of Administrative Action" to legislative leaders.
Lighthizer's letter -- despite indicating that he intended to work to
make the deal agreeable to Democrats -- was not received warmly. "The
Trump Administration's decision ... is not a positive step," Pelosi
responded. "It indicates a lack of knowledge on the part of the
Administration on the policy and process to pass a trade agreement."
Lighthizer's May letter did not start a countdown clock, but sending the
official bill implementing the USMCA would: lawmakers would have 90
working days after receiving it to hold a vote. White House officials,
including Mulvaney, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, National Economic
Council director Larry Kudlow and White House economist Kevin Hassett,
have dared Pelosi to put the bill on the floor by suggesting the deal
already has overwhelming bipartisan support. "The White House and USTR
are working in good faith and constructively with Members of Congress to
address concerns some have voiced about the USMCA," an administration
official told CNBC. "We urge Congress to approve USMCA as soon as
possible to unlock its benefits for America's workers, farmers,
ranchers, and businesses." Privately, [senior administration officials
suggest there's some extra breathing room to build support for the deal
since the White House and Congress have yet to notch a budget deal. **An
agreement on the debt ceiling** and spending for the 2020 fiscal year
**must be reached before the end of September**]{.underline}. With
expectations for a deal before a six-week recess begins July 26 becoming
less realistic, lawmakers likely will be in session in September,
instead of out on the campaign trail.

House Democrats Warn", Economics,
<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-08/forcing-usmca-timeline-could-backfire-house-democrats-warn)//AA>

A group of moderate House Democrats is warning the White House against
sending Congress the new version of NAFTA for a vote this week, saying
it would be premature. President Donald Trump, under existing trade
rules, can submit the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement to
Congress on Tuesday, and some in the administration have advocated doing
so to build pressure for a vote before the House begins a six-week
recess on July 26. The pro-trade New Democrat Coalition asked U.S. Trade
Representative Robert Lighthizer to hold off because
**[[Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s']{.mark} [concerns about labor, environment,
enforcement and drug provisions in the deal have not yet been
resolved.]{.mark}]{.underline}** "While we appreciate your willingness
to listen, we have not seen any meaningful progress or tangible
proposals from you to address these concerns," according to a letter
signed by Representative Derek Kilmer and others. The letter says the
group is looking forward to working with the White House to ensure a
vote later this year. Submitting the USMCA implementing bill would be an
attempt to force a House vote within 90 legislative days under Trade

When you look at the short span of President Trump's political career,
one question jumps out: [How much of his]{.underline} craziest, most
[paranoid]{.underline} and norm-violating [behavior is motivated by a
desire to keep his financial arrangements secret? It began with Trump's
bizarre refusal to release his tax returns]{.underline}, in defiance of
both a nearly half-century practice and Trump's own promise that he'd do
so. [Then there was his refusal to divest from his sprawling
multinational empire]{.underline}, or even put it into a blind trust ---
either of which would have forced at least some information disclosure
to a third party. [There were also the interviews and tweetstorms
calling journalists who report on his finances "enemies of the
people]{.underline}," and suggestions that federal officials who audit
him are anti-Christian. As well as his implicit threat in 2017 that he
would fire special counsel Robert S. Mueller III if he crossed a "red
line" by examining Trump's personal financial dealings. Also, his
curious personnel priorities. Once it became clear that House Democrats
would exercise their explicit statutory authority to get Trump's tax
returns from the Internal Revenue Service, Trump asked Senate Majority
Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to prioritize confirmation of Trump's IRS
general counsel nominee ahead of confirmation of a new attorney general.
This IRS general counsel pick, mind you, also happened to have
previously advised the Trump Organization on tax issues. [Trump's
treasury secretary has also been spending so much time safeguarding
Trump's tax return]{.underline}s, in violation of that explicit statute,
that [the activity is]{.underline} reportedly [crowding out his day
job]{.underline}. All of which raises the question: [Why]{.underline}
exactly [is Trump]{.underline} (and the rest of his administration)
[expending so much **energy and political capital** to keep these
documents hidden]{.underline}? What could possibly be so disturbing or
incriminating to justify such an effort?

He didn't, as Barack Obama did in his first two years, pass a sweeping
domestic agenda toward the end of becoming a transformational
president[. **Trump largely spends political capital on tweets and other
outrages, and** much of **his transformational energy is devoted to
changing** our **norms for how a president speaks and
behaves**]{.underline}. For a while, the Obama doctrine was, "Don't do
stupid stuff." [The Trump team has built out the doctrine
to]{.underline}, "Privately consider and sometimes [openly threaten
stupid stuff, but at the end of the day, don't do it
(usually]{.underline})." The Mexico tariff threat was typical. If Trump
had gone through with the steadily escalating tariffs, it would have
been a blow to our own economy and that of an ally, while risking a
political revolt in Congress. Instead, he got what might prove to be
meaningful concessions from Mexico, and, even if he hadn't, could have
easily found some reason --- not overly concerned with consistency ---
to delay or call off the tariffs. The thing about a Trump threat is that
he always controls whether he's going to go through with it or not. He's
going to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement, actually
no, he's not. He's going to impose auto tariffs on Canada, well, not
really. What he's going to do is sign a new trade deal with Mexico and
Canada that's a somewhat altered version of NAFTA and urge Congress to
pass it. Allies might be understandably appalled (or at times alarmed)
by his habit of berating them and squeezing them for concessions, but
the alliance system, a product of deeper forces than the persona of any
one president, remains intact.

### No PC -- Trump Lost Manufacturing Base

#### Trump's already losing ground with rust belt voters

the Rust Belt May Haunt Him]{.underline},\" No Publication,

//RS

When General Motors idled its auto plant in Lordstown, Ohio, this month,
President Trump adopted a familiar strategy: He issued a nasty string of
tweets blaming other people and promised, in effect, that he would
restore the past. [Trump\'s angry, backward-looking approach may still
appeal to some Rust Belt voters]{.underline}. [But in the Ohio and
Pennsylvania towns that helped win the presidency for Trump in 2016, his
vow to turn back the clock hasn\'t worked out very well]{.underline},
and **[there are signs the Rust Belt may be corroding for him
politically]{.underline}**. Lordstown\'s struggles, like those of other
nearby mill towns, illustrate the harsh fact that manufacturing is a
dynamic process. Old jobs are disappearing because of changes in
technology or consumer preferences; trying to resist change is usually a
fool\'s game. Rust Belt communities that are succeeding are the ones
that have adapted by embracing new technologies and innovation.
Presidential leadership in this period of technological transition
should focus on the future, rather than the past. But [Trump seems
almost a technophobe]{.underline}. Axios reported this week that [he
thinks driverless cars are \"crazy.\"]{.underline} He tweeted March 12,
after the crash of a high-tech Boeing jetliner: \"Airplanes are becoming
far too complex to fly \... I see it all the time in many products.
Always seeking to go one unnecessary step further, when often old and
simpler is far better[.\" Trump\'s response]{.underline} to Lordstown
[was to]{.underline} [attack David Green]{.underline}, the UAW local
president, implying that he was at fault along with GM, [and
demand]{.underline}ing that [he \"get his act together and
produce]{.underline}.\" [Green had sent letters to Trump]{.underline} in
July 2018 and February 2019 warning about threats to the plant. [Trump
didn\'t respond]{.underline}. After Trump\'s Twitter tirade, [Rep. Tim
Ryan, the Ohio Democrat who represents the Lordstown area]{.underline},
fired back: \"[The President\'s tweet \... is offensive and does nothing
to help bring back the manufacturing jobs he promised to my
district]{.underline}.\" Ryan argued that \"the best thing is to help\"
GM renovate Lordstown and perhaps build electric vehicles there. Local
residents said much the same thing to the Youngstown Vindicator this
month: GM or a new owner should focus on new technology and making
products people want to buy, rather than restore production of the
low-selling Chevrolet Cruze. Trump is vulnerable in the Rust Belt
because he made such extravagant promises when he successfully wooed
voters in 2016. \"He won this area \-- a largely Democratic area \-- and
he has not said a word yet, and that\'s just pathetic,\" warned Jim
Graham a former UAW leader at Lordstown, in an interview with the
Vindicator back in November, when GM said it planned to halt Cruze
production there. Local residents remember Trump\'s proclamation at a
July 2017 rally in nearby Youngstown: \"Those jobs \[that\] have left
Ohio, they\'re all coming back \... Don\'t sell your house.\" Tommy
Wolikow, a Lordstown worker, told the Vindicator: \"I kind of turned
into a Trump supporter at that time. I believed what he said. \...
Almost two years later, I\'m seeing nothing but job losses.\" Homeowners
in Youngstown certainly haven\'t seen a boom. According to Zillow, the
online realty broker, the median price for a house in Youngstown is
\$39,900. The national median price of homes currently listed is
\$279,000. Browse the real estate ads for mill towns across Ohio and
Pennsylvania and you\'ll see just how tough it is to be a Rust Belt
resident, trapped in a downward cycle. What\'s the right answer for Rust
Belt towns where the old manufacturing base has disappeared? An
interesting example is Erie, Pennsylvania. Most big factories there have
closed in recent years, but the city is rebuilding itself around its
local universities and a big insurance company. Profits from a big
gambling casino in Erie County are funneled partly to \"innovation
spaces\" at four local campuses. Erie may have lost manufacturing jobs,
but it\'s above the state average in advanced industries, says Ben
Speggen, a local journalist who helps run a think tank in Erie called
the Jefferson Educational Society. \"There has been a real shift in
understanding that our Rust Belt economy is not solely tied to
manufacturing,\" he says. Another key to success is welcoming
foreigners. About 10 percent of Erie\'s population is refugees,
according to James and Deborah Fallows in their recent book, \"Our
Towns.\" One of the 10 characteristics they found in successful local
communities adapting to change is that \"they make themselves open.\"
O[ne more lesson from Erie County, in the heart of the Rust
Belt:]{.underline} **[Trump won there in]{.underline}** the
**[2016]{.underline}** presidential election, **[but in]{.underline}**

"ARMS SALES TO SAUDI ARABIA: WORTH THE COST?" January 11, 2018
<https://civiliansinconflict.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/CaseStudySaudiArabia.pdf>
//dmr

Since the Saudi Arabia-led coalition began its air campaign in Yemen in
March 2015, the US and the UK have transferred over \$5 billion worth of
arms to Saudi Arabia.1 According to Amnesty International, at least
4,600 civilians had been killed and 8,000 injured over the course of the
conflict as of March 2017, the majority of which the UN and credible
human rights organizations have repeatedly attributed to the Saudi-led
coalition.2,3 The Royal Saudi Air Force and its partners have struck
funerals,4 schools, and markets, causing mass civilian casualties and
leading to allegations of war crimes and grave breaches of international
law.5,6,7 Most recently, The New York Times reported that at least
thirty civilians, the majority seasonal agriculture workers, had been
killed in an airstrike by the Saudi Air Force near Yemen's capital of
Sanaa.8 Many of the bombs that the coalition has used in these attacks,
such as the GBU-24 PAVEWAY III laser-guided bomb produced by Raytheon,
are American-made and licensed for sale and export by the US
government.9 The US has also provided Saudi Arabia with military
aircraft, refueling, intelligence, and advisors.10 In October 2016,
[[citing concerns over]{.mark} the "]{.underline}troubling series of
[[attacks striking Yemeni civilians]{.underline}]{.mark}" in the wake of
a Saudi airstrike on a funeral hall that killed 140, the Obama
administration announced that it was undertaking an "immediate review"
of its assistance to the Saudi-led Coalition to "better align \[our
support\] with US principles, values and interests."11 In December 2016,
despite heavy lobbying by Raytheon,12 the Obama administration blocked a
sale by Raytheon of about 16,000 guided munitions kits, citing concerns
over civilian harm.13 The Trump administration has since reversed these
restrictions, and has signaled its aspiration to approve new deals
valued at \$110 billion.14 In September of 2016, [[the]{.mark} US
[Senate considered legislation to block]{.mark} \$1.15 billion in [arms
sales to Saudi Arabia]{.mark}]{.underline}.15 [[Though the
measure]{.underline}]{.mark} to disapprove the sale [[ultimately
failed]{.underline}]{.mark} on a 26-71 vote, **[[Congressional
appetite]{.mark} to take action [grew as]{.mark} the air campaign
continued and [the casualty figure grew]{.mark}]{.underline}**. On April
6, 2017, [31 members]{.underline} of Congress [wrote]{.underline} to
Secretary of State Rex [Tillerson]{.underline} to inquire into the
conduct of the Royal Saudi Air Force.16 On the same day,
[Senato]{.underline}r Chris [Murphy introduced]{.underline} Senate Joint
Resolution 40, [a "joint resolution to]{.underline} [provide limitations
on]{.underline} the transfer of air-to-ground [munitions]{.underline}
from the United States to Saudi Arabia."17 The resolution included
civilian harm-related conditions under which sales must be made and
required briefings for the appropriate congressional committees before
formal notification. On June 13, the resolution failed to pass by a vote
of 53-47.18 The case of US and UK arms sales to Saudi is worth examining
for broader implications. For example, [although the US Congress did not
block the sale]{.underline} of munitions to Saudi, **[[the]{.mark} US
[Government spent significant political capital]{.mark}, energy, and
resources [to defend the sale]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.
[Policymakers]{.underline}]{.mark} may [[need to reappraise
the]{.underline}]{.mark} relative value of the financial and security
[[benefits of any one arms sale against **the prospects of greater
Congressional scrutiny or public opposition**]{.underline}]{.mark}
stemming from concerns over the misuse of weapons. Policymakers could
also consider if limited, selective, self-imposed constraints could
yield equally valuable policy dividends over the long term. The US
government has also carefully avoided determinations that the Saudi
coalition is in violation of international law, amidst broadly held
perceptions of unlawful conduct. Policymakers should assess whether
doing so serves to erode public confidence in domestic and international
law. Restricting arms sales on the basis of a "reasonably foreseeable"
possibility of violations, rather than knowledge of violations or intent
to commit violations, could preserve flexibility while bolstering the
role of international law in arms sales decisions.

virtue has been a vice as well. Too often, [the administration's defense
of the strategic relationship has appeared as unduly solicitous of
Mohammed bin Salman's sensitivities, unnecessarily dismissive or even
contemptuous of Congress' legitimate concerns, and insufficiently
attentive to Saudi actions that have genuinely threatened both U.S.
interests and values]{.underline}. The fact is that over the course of
the past 18 months, Mohammed bin Salman has engaged in a series of
reckless and destabilizing behaviors that should have been setting off
alarm bells across the administration.Mohammed bin Salman has engaged in
a series of reckless and destabilizing behaviors that should have been
setting off alarm bells across the administration. Instead, almost
without exception, they were met with the diplomatic equivalent of a
shrug. From taking the Lebanese prime minister hostage to billion-dollar
shakedowns of prominent princes and businessman, from detaining and
torturing peaceful women's rights activists to blowing up relations with
Canada over an objectionable tweet or two, the administration was
largely AWOL when it came to calling the Saudis to account and
attempting to short-circuit the crown prince's impulsive,
counterproductive misadventures. [By the time of Khashoggi's shocking
demise inside the kingdom's Istanbul consulate last year, it had become
clear that the hands-off, highly transactional approach to managing the
Saudis pursued by Trump and his son-in-law and senior advisor, Jared
Kushner, had gone badly astray]{.underline}. Giving Mohammed bin Salman
carte blanche to indulge his darkest instincts in exchange for a few
billion dollars in weapons purchases, lower oil prices, and a slightly
less hostile attitude toward an otherwise doomed U.S. plan for Middle
East peace was neither a wise nor sustainable trade-off for U.S. foreign
policy.

accessed 7/4/19, JME.)

Donald Trump's Middle East policy is many things, but it is not
incoherent. At the core of the president's approach has been a stark
redrawing of the friend-enemy distinction: doubling down on support,
often unquestioning, for allies like Saudi Arabia and Israel, while
refocusing the near-entirety of American ire on Iran. [That Trump has
bet big on the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia, Mohamed bin Salman,
makes the Saudis' disappearing and likely assassination of dissident
Jamal Khashoggi in their Istanbul consulate]{.underline}---"monstrous"
on its own terms---[a different sort of escalation.]{.underline} For
Trump, this has been personal. His son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner
has worked to develop a close relationship with bin Salman, colloquially
known as MbS, seeing the young crown prince as a strong partner in
isolating Iran and softening Arab enmity toward Israel. [In Trump's
world,]{.underline} friends---particularly [friends that are both Arab
and authoritarian]{.underline}---[are to be criticized as little as
possible, especially on low priorities for the administration like human
rights.]{.underline} This hands-off approach has emboldened and
empowered MbS to increasingly destructive effect over the past year and
a half, offering a reminder that the prospect of U.S. pressure---if not
actual U.S. pressure---serves as a constraint on allies that tend
towards overreach. What is both striking and telling is how half-hearted
and generally uninterested the Saudis have been in countering evidence
they assassinated Khashoggi. (Take for example the Saudi ambassador's
suggestion to Senator Bob Corker that their consulate surveillance video
only "live-streams.") But this is precisely what makes Saudi Arabia's
behavior in this episode even more reckless than the ongoing crackdown
on even its milder critics or its increasingly callous disregard for
human life in the Yemen war. [**Trump has invested political capital and
extended unprecedented goodwill to MbS, drawing considerable criticism
in the process**. In a sense, this has been Trump's "big bet," perhaps
his biggest one in the Middle East.]{.underline} As Axios's Jonathan
Swan put it, "[The Trump administration, led by Jared Kushner, made
about as big a bet on MbS the visionary-reformer and the Saudis as it's
possible for a US admin to make." The goodwill has not been
reciprocated. Rather, MbS is in effect taunting Trump, gloating in his
ability to get away with anything. A supposedly close friend acting in
such a manner could be]{.underline}---and perhaps should be---[taken by
Trump as a personal affront. This further and perhaps even conclusively
invalidates Trump's decision to orient America's Middle East strategy
around a new and changing Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. Trump's recent
comments were somewhat unclear, but he seemed bothered that he even had
to talk about it: "I am concerned about that," he said in response to a
question about Khashoggi's disappearance. "I don't like hearing about it
and hopefully that will sort itself out. Right now, nobody knows
anything about it. There's some pretty bad stories about it. I do not
like it." With Trump, however, it is always hard to tell where his
passions may lead him. Trump may not care enough about the assassination
of a prominent journalist, who was also a U.S. resident and a Washington
Post columnist. But the events may also awaken the side of Trump that,
first as a candidate and now as president, has suggested an impatience
with Saudi Arabia and its military dependence on the United States. In
an October 2 rally in Southaven, Mississippi, Trump riffed, saying
something that received little attention at the time but in any other
administration would have likely have been front-page news: "We protect
Saudi Arabia---would you say they're rich? And I love the king, King
Salman, but I said, 'King we're protecting you. You might not be there
for two weeks without us. You have to pay for your military, you have to
pay." It is little surprise that Khashoggi's disappearance has provoked
not just frustration from U.S. politicians, but anger, including from
Senator Lindsey Graham, who said there would be "hell to pay" if
Khashoggi was assassinated. This is the danger of transactional
relationships with countries and rulers that not only don't share our
values, but often don't share our interests either. To outsource our
Middle East policy to a reckless leader who appears to have such
disrespect for the United States---and its support for his country---was
always a mistake. Now it is also an embarrassment. Even for those who
care little about human rights in the Middle East, the disappearance of
Khashoggi calls into question the reliability of an ally that has
insisted on acting in such brazen fashion. If Trump's foreign policy
really is about "America first," then allies who show blatant disregard
for America, American values, and American interests should incur
significant costs. What might those costs be? This is what the
conversation over the future of U.S.-Saudi relationship must turn to.
Trump is at least partly correct about Saudi dependence on the United
States. As my colleague Bruce Riedel writes, [the Saudi Air Force is "is
entirely dependent on American and British support for its air fleet of
F15 fighter jets, Apache helicopters, and Tornado aircraft. If either
Washington or London halts the flow of logistics, the \[air force\] will
be grounded."]{.underline} Bad allies, particularly in the Middle East
where they abound, have been a recurring problem for successive U.S.
administrations. U.S. policymakers need---or think they need---them,
even when those allies go out of their way to undermine their
relationships with the United States. [Those allies
believe]{.underline}---mostly correctly---[that the United States will
express concern and complain, but ultimately do little]{.underline}. The
worst offenses will be forgotten in the name of national-security
interests, as they have been so many times before. [It is time to call
Saudi Arabia's bluff.]{.underline}

#### The link turn outweighs the link---momentum to reign in Trump and penalize Saudis

**Carney and Kheel 6/27** (Jordain and Rebecca, defense reporter, *The
Hill,* "Trump, Congress set for new showdown on Saudi Arabia," published
June 27^th^, 2019,
<https://thehill.com/homenews/house/450545-trump-congress-set-for-new-showdown-on-saudi-arabia>,
accessed 7/2/19, JME.)

[Lawmakers and President Trump are laying the groundwork for a new
showdown over Saudi Arabia, underscoring deep frustrations on Capitol
Hill. [With Trump expected to veto resolutions blocking his]{.mark} arms
[sales to Saudi]{.mark} Arabia, [lawmakers are]{.mark} already
[eyeing]{.mark} additional [avenues to push back]{.mark} on the
U.S.-Saudi relationship]{.underline}, which has soured in Congress over
the Yemen civil war and the death of Washington Post contributor Jamal
Khashoggi. [Members in [both chambers are moving forward with]{.mark}
separate [bills that would hem in Trump or penalize Saudi
Arabia.]{.mark}]{.underline} The House Foreign Affairs Committee
advanced a bill Wednesday that would require the director of national
intelligence to determine who is responsible for Khashoggi's death and
would impose visa restrictions on those people. Committee Chairman Eliot
Engel (D-N.Y.) said he expects that bill to come to the floor "shortly"
after the July Fourth recess. "[The horrific murder of Jamal Khashoggi
demands accountability and justice]{.underline}," Engel said during the
committee's consideration of the bill. "[After the astounding evidence
we've seen, it can't just be business as usual. And since the
administration is dragging its feet on taking any meaningful action,
Congress must step forward."]{.underline} The [action in the committee
comes as several Saudi-related amendments have been filed for the
House's version of the National Defense Authorization Act, including
measures to block the arms sales]{.underline}, amend the Arms Export
Control Act and end U.S. military support for the Saudi coalition in
Yemen, among others. The House will take up the mammoth defense bill
next month, though only a fraction of the 600-plus amendments typically
get a vote. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee also approved
legislation this week that would restrict Trump's ability to use an
"emergency" provision of the Arms Export Control Act to bypass a
requirement that the administration give Congress a 30-day notification
before an arms sale. [**[Several Republicans have raised
concerns]{.mark} about how the administration used the emergency
provision**, bolstering its chances of picking up additional GOP support
outside of the committee. The bipartisan **legislation**, spearheaded by
Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), **comes [after Trump sparked fierce backlash
by leapfrogging Congress on a deal to sell arms to Saudi Arabia despite
bipartisan opposition on Capitol Hil]{.mark}**[l]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The administration argued that Iran's actions in the region required
enacting the emergency language on the Arms Export Control Act and
forcing through the sale. Menendez said that he hasn't gotten a
commitment for a floor vote on his legislation but that he "is going to
push for it." Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jim Risch
(R-Idaho) is also drafting additional Saudi Arabia legislation that he
is expected to unveil after the recess. Risch has stressed he wants a
bill that could win over both White House and Democratic support, a
potentially high bar given the deep differences between some lawmakers
and Trump when it comes to Saudi Arabia. "Some of the things that have
happened cannot go unnoticed. There are certainly going to have to be
repercussions and we have been negotiating with all parties, including
my staff and the staff of the ranking member, together with the State
Department and the White House," Risch said during a recent floor
speech, announcing that he and Menendez had set up a framework for
further committee action. Menendez is expected to offer the Saudi Arabia
Accountability and Yemen Act as an amendment to the forthcoming Risch
legislation. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who has been at the center of
the chamber's Saudi Arabia action, said he had also been in touch with
Risch as the GOP senator has drafted the bill and "we've given some
suggestions to the chairman about it." [The push for additional action
comes as the House still needs to vote on resolutions blocking Trump's
arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Jordan.]{.underline} The 22 arms sales, estimated to be worth more than
\$8 billion, include precision-guided bombs, Patriot missiles, mortar
rounds, drones, fighter jet parts and other military support. Engel said
he does not have a specific timeline for considering the arms sales
resolutions but vowed to take them up in his committee. "We're
absolutely going to pursue it," he said. "We've already had some
classified briefings. And it's too important an issue because it has
repercussions not only for Saudi Arabia now, but for lots of countries,
including Saudi Arabia, down the road." Asked if there is a rush to pass
the resolutions before the first weapons are delivered, Engel would not
comment on the timeline of the deliveries, citing classified
information. But in general, he said, "the deadline is now. We have to
move on these things now." A spokesperson for House Majority Leader
Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) told The Hill that they would plan to bring the
Senate-passed resolutions to the floor in July. Trump is expected to
veto the resolutions of disapproval; the Senate will not have the votes

the sale with 51 and 53 votes, respectively. [But [the push for
additional legislation is the latest sign of the **growing frustration
on Capitol Hill about the U.S.-Saudi relationship**. The Senate]{.mark}
passed a [resolution last year that named]{.mark} Saudi Crown Prince
[M]{.mark}ohammed [b]{.mark}in [S]{.mark}alman [as responsible for
Khashoggi's death.]{.mark} The resolution [marked a significant break
with Trump]{.mark} --- he has refused to name the crown prince as
responsible --- but stalled in the then-GOP-controlled

year forcing Trump to remove troops in or affecting Yemen unless they
were fighting al Qaeda; Trump vetoed the resolution. But unlike the
Yemen resolution or the move to block Trump's arms sales, any additional
legislation will need 60 votes in the Senate and Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell's (R-Ky.) support to get a floor vote, throwing a curveball
into the chances of getting another bill to Trump's desk. Sen. Lindsey
Graham (R-S.C.), a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said he
hoped the Senate will be able to find common ground, either by getting a
bill Trump would back or building enough support to successfully
override a veto, which would be the first of the Trump administration.
"You get a bill that would get a veto override, that's one way to do
it," he said, "another would be to get a bill that he'll sign, so we'll
keep plugging away."

#### Plan boosts Trump's credibility with lawmakers---censuring MBS is their top priority 

**Friedman & Bayoumy 7/1** (Uri, staff writer covering national security
and global affairs, and Yara, senior editor, *The Atlantic,* "The
U.S.-Saudi Alliance Is on the Brink," published July 1^st^, 2019,

An effort is under way in Washington to fundamentally overhaul, if not
end, a decades-old American alliance---but it didn't come at the
direction of the alliance-skeptical Donald Trump. The president, in
fact, has paradoxically emerged as the greatest force of resistance to
the change. [Fed up with the catastrophic human cost of Saudi Arabia's
military intervention in Yemen's civil war and appalled by the murder of
the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, **Congress seemingly
attempts some sort of measure to censure the kingdom every week**. Yet
at every turn, the White House has blocked or circumvented those moves,
standing staunchly by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, or MbS,
while escalating its confrontation with his archenemy,
Iran.]{.underline} The real reckoning in the U.S.-Saudi partnership
could come if a Democrat is elected president in 2020, though early
warning signs are already visible. [Virtually all **Democratic
lawmakers,** along with **several Republican members of Congress and
various lobbyists, analysts, and former officials, are shunning the
Saudis** to the point where a visit to Washington, D.C., by MbS, the
heir apparent who was welcomed in 2017 and 2018, seems inconceivable
anytime soon]{.underline}. When Franklin D. Roosevelt and King Abdulaziz
met aboard the USS Quincy in 1945, neither could have foreseen the
cracks that would form in a relationship built on mutual benefit: a
steady supply of Saudi oil in exchange for U.S. military protection.
[But **even the fallout from the September 11
attacks**]{.underline}---in which 15 of the 19 hijackers were
Saudi---[**did not present the kind of existential challenge** evident
today. U.S. lawmakers are engaged in numerous efforts to restrict arms
sales to the kingdom and hold MbS, along with other top officials,
accountable for Khashoggi's death. For now, **the Saudis are banking on
the Trump administration's allegiance**.]{.underline} Yet they
acknowledge, or at the very least pay lip service to, their precarious
position. "We in \[Saudi Arabia\] recognize that the relationship has
come under strain recently, but we are working hard on restoring it to
what it once was. We realize it's going to take some time, but we see it
as a marathon not a sprint," a senior Saudi official wrote to us
recently on the condition of anonymity to discuss the issue. That's far
from the mea culpa U.S. lawmakers are demanding. [In May, the
administration invoked emergency powers to bypass Congress and sell
billions of dollars' worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, a show of support
that nevertheless reflected the administration's awareness that it would
not have been able to get lawmakers to approve the arms sales. The
Senate responded by passing several measures to try to prevent the
sales---moves remarkable not just for their bipartisan backing, but also
for the fact that they came amid heightened tensions with Iran, which
Trump cited as grounds for the emergency transactions. In April, Trump
vetoed a resolution to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led military
intervention against the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen. He had to
take that step because seven Republicans in the Senate and 16 in the
House of Representatives had joined nearly every Democrat in both
chambers to support the legislation]{.underline}. Trump, whose first
trip abroad as president was to Saudi Arabia, has championed the
alliance in part because his administration and the Saudi government are
both alarmed by Iran's suspected nuclear-weapons pursuits and support
for militant groups in the Middle East. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
focused only on the threats posed by Iran during meetings with the Saudi
king and crown prince in Riyadh last week. And while Trump said he
raised Khashoggi's killing with MbS at the G20 summit in Japan, he would
not be drawn on the CIA's intelligence that reportedly concluded with
high confidence that the crown prince ordered the journalist's murder.
[But **Trump's motivations for dismissing concerns** about the war in
Yemen and Khashoggi's assassination range from the close personal
relationship between MbS and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to
Riyadh's **plentiful purchases of U.S.-made weapons**, which the
president argues create American jobs]{.underline}. "You have people
wanting to cut off Saudi Arabia. They bought \$450 billion" worth of
military equipment, Trump declared at a recent campaign rally, greatly
inflating the actual figures. "I don't want to lose them!" Trump's
approach is to "align with this growing Saudi, Emirati, Israeli,
anti-Iran conception of the region, and \[Sanders\] is very much of a
different view.

#### **Any influence the Saudi lobby still has will evaporate next year**

**Friedman & Bayoumy 7/1** (Uri, staff writer covering national security
and global affairs, and Yara, senior editor, *The Atlantic,* "The
U.S.-Saudi Alliance Is on the Brink," published July 1^st^, 2019,

Most Americans, of course, have had negative views of Saudi Arabia since
the 9/**11** attacks; two-thirds of the public currently view the
kingdom unfavorably, Gallup's highest reading in its three decades of
polling on the question. The big development now is that there's also
serious ferment in the nation's capital, where [Saudi Arabia by one
estimate poured more than \$40 million into lobbying
Congress]{.underline}, the executive branch, think tanks, and media
outlets [in 2017 and 2018 alone]{.underline}---tripling its spending on
influence operations from the last year of Barack Obama's administration
to the first year of the Trump administration. [All the Saudis have to
show for that money, though, is a rock-solid friend in the White House
and an open revolt on Capitol Hill.]{.underline} "The Saudis used to
have really strong bipartisan support in Washington," Senator Chris
Murphy of Connecticut, a Democrat and longtime critic of Riyadh, told
us. Now "they are clinging to this alliance simply through the force of
the regime's relationship with one person: Donald Trump." "[Maybe we
have a hard time forcing a reset while Trump is in office," added
Murphy, who has sponsored numerous bills to rein in the security
relationship with the Saudis. "**But a reset's coming**]{.underline}."
Republican and Democratic presidents alike have been forced to mostly
give Saudi Arabia a free pass on rights abuses and political repression,
given the extent to which Washington relies on Riyadh as a stable
geopolitical weight in the Middle East. [But several 2020 candidates
have made their displeasure clear. Joe Biden]{.underline}, the current
front-runner among Democrats vying for the White House, [wants out of
the war in Yemen]{.underline} and once likened the U.S. partnership with
Saudi Arabia to America siding with a "no-good SOB" like Joseph Stalin
during World War II. [Cory Booker has called for the United States to
"reexamine \[the\] entire relationship" with Riyadh. Elizabeth Warren
has slammed Trump for appeasing U.S. defense contractors by not halting
the flow of weapons to Saudi Arabia.]{.underline} Pete Buttigieg, in a
national-security speech last month, said that on his watch the United
States would "remain open" to working with Riyadh for the American
people's benefit. "But," he added, "we can no longer sell out our
deepest values for the sake of fossil-fuel access and lucrative business
deals." [And Bernie Sanders has referred to MbS as a "murderous
despot,"]{.underline} included Saudi Arabia in an "axis" of
authoritarian powers that he claims Trump is emboldening, an[d inserted
Saudi lobbying in Washington into his signature issue of wealthy special
interests corrupting government policy making.]{.underline} Sanders, the
sponsor of one of the Senate's Yemen resolutions, questions "whether the
basic bargain that was made between FDR and the Saudi king back in
1945," of "security for oil," still holds, says his foreign-policy
adviser, Matt Duss. Nonetheless, it's "not necessarily productive" to
"flip over the table on the U.S.-Saudi relationship" at the outset of a
new administration, Duss adds, noting that Sanders recognizes that
elements of the relationship, such as intelligence sharing, remain
important and that the stability of oil markets has an impact on the
U.S. economy. Asked how worried the Saudis are about the future of the
alliance should a Democrat be elected in 2020, the senior Saudi official
said that the relationship is "institutional," and that Democratic and
Republican presidential candidates tend to change their campaign
position on Saudi Arabia once they're in office and understand "our
economic cooperation, coordination of oil policies, and our partnership
in countering terrorism" and Iran. [This time, however, campaign
broadsides may not give way to business as usual. United Nations and
U.S. assessments have implicated the crown prince himself in the murder
of Khashoggi]{.underline}---who was a U.S. permanent
resident---**[constituting a brazen betrayal of the
alliance]{.underline}**, "the equivalent of a spouse cheating in the
marriage," says Representative Ro Khanna of California, a Democrat and
leading proponent in the House of ending U.S. military involvement in
Yemen. "The marriage may recover and survive, but it will never be the
same." [The Saudis are "not going to be an enemy" of the United States,
he adds, "but I certainly think \[they\] have lost their status as an
ally."]{.underline} [**The Khashoggi killing has** not just angered
members of Congress, but also **prompted some lobbying firms and think
tanks to reject Saudi funding**]{.underline}. Saudi leaders recognize
that the damage done to relations with the United States by the incident
"is worse than 9/11" in terms of the toll taken on the alliance, says
Firas Maksad of the Arabia Foundation, a Washington-based think tank
familiar with Saudi officials' thinking, who met with Saudi officials
during a visit to Riyadh in March. (Riyadh denies the crown prince's
role in Khashoggi's killing. The senior Saudi official highlighted the
government's efforts to bring those behind Khashoggi's murder to
justice, but these steps haven't satisfied many U.S. lawmakers.) While
the Treasury and State Departments have sanctioned more than a dozen
Saudi officials for their involvement in the Khashoggi killing, these
actions also fall far short of the punitive measures against those in
the highest ranks of the Saudi government that many in Congress are
demanding.

//JSL

WASHINGTON --- [Senators from both sides of the aisle said]{.underline}
Wednesday [they planned to block U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia and
other Arab states in a bipartisan rebuke]{.underline} of President
Donald Trump, saying they had to act to safeguard Congress\'s right to
review weapons deals. The announcement from the bipartisan group of
senators was the first response from Congress after the Trump
administration bypassed lawmakers on May 24 to push through more than
\$8 billion worth of arms deals to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Jordan. Congress by law reviews all arms sales. But
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared a national security
\"emergency\" to push through the package without congressional
approval, citing what he called an urgent threat posed by Iran. The
senators are introducing 22 separate joint resolutions of disapproval
for each of the sales, setting up a possible confrontation with Trump
that could play out in coming months. If the resolutions are adopted and
Trump vetoes the measures, Congress would have to secure a two-thirds
majority to override a presidential veto. It's unclear if the
legislation could secure the two-thirds majority needed to overcome a
presidential veto. But [**there is growing concern across the political
spectrum** over the administration's approach to Saudi
Arabia]{.underline} and its treatment of Congress. In a vote in March to
end U.S. military support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen and check
presidential war powers, seven Republican senators joined Democrats to
pass the bill. Trump vetoed the legislation last month. [The legislative
action was necessary]{.underline} \"to protect and reaffirm Congress\'
role of approving arms sales to foreign governments,\" [said a statement
from Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham, Todd Young, Rand Paul and
Democratic Sens. Bob Menendez, Patrick Leahy, Chris Murphy and Jack
Reed.]{.underline} \"The manner in which the administration has moved
forward with these sales is unprecedented and is at odds with
longstanding practice and cooperation between the Congress and the
executive branch that results in the approval of billions of dollars of
arms sales annually,\" the senators\' statement said. The dispute over
the arms sales is the latest sign of friction over a range of issues
between Trump and his fellow Republicans in Congress, many of whom are
frustrated at the administration\'s handling of nominations and its
attempts to avoid congressional oversight. Republican lawmakers warned
the White House this week not to go ahead with threatened tariffs
against Mexico. [The new arms sales faced opposition in
Congress]{.underline} partly because of the administration\'s decision
to bypass lawmakers but also [because of growing outrage over the
Saudi-led coalition\'s war in Yemen and the killing of Washington Post
columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in
Istanbul.]{.underline} Arguing against the arms sales,
[Graham]{.underline}, R-S.C., an ally of Trump on most issues, [referred
to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\'s alleged involvement in
Khashoggi\'s killing]{.underline}. The CIA has concluded that the crown
prince approved of the killing of Khashoggi, a Saudi national who
resided in Virginia. \"While I understand that Saudi Arabia is a
strategic ally, [the behavior of Mohammed bin Salman cannot be ignored.
Now is not the time to do business as usual with Saudi Arabia,\" said
Graham]{.underline}, who leads a subcommittee that oversees funding for
the State Department. \"Regrettably, Secretary Pompeo\'s abuse of this
emergency authority has broken the arms sales process,\" said Menendez,
the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. If the
secretary of state fails to withdraw his emergency declaration and
submit the arms sales for congressional review, said Menendez, \"I am
prepared to move forward with any and all options to nullify the
licenses at issue for both Saudi Arabia and UAE and eliminate any
ability for the Administration to bypass Congress in future arms
sales.\" The planned arms sales include mortar bombs, engines and
maintenance support for F-15 fighter jets for Saudi Arabia and equipment
for AH-64 helicopters, laser-guided rockets, javelin anti-tank missiles,
Patriot missiles and F-16 fighter jet engine parts for the United Arab
Emirates. But [the most controversial weapons in the deal are
precision-guided bombs, which would almost certainly be used in the
Saudi-led air war in Yemen]{.underline}.

//JSL

WASHINGTON --- [The Senate voted to block the sale of billions of
dollars of munitions to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates]{.underline} on Thursday, **[in a sharp and bipartisan rebuke
of the Trump administration]{.underline}**'s attempt to circumvent
Congress to allow the exports by declaring an emergency over Iran. In
three back-to-back votes, [Republicans joined Democrats to register
their growing anger with the administration's]{.underline} use of
emergency power to cut lawmakers out of national security decisions, as
well as the White House's [unflagging support for the Saudis despite
congressional pressure to punish Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after
the killing in October of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi]{.underline}. A
United Nations report released Wednesday made the most authoritative
case to date that responsibility for the killing and its cover-up lies
at the highest levels of the Saudi royal court. [**No other foreign
policy issue has created as large a rift between President Trump and
Congress**, and the vote to block the arms sales deepens the
divide]{.underline}. It is the second time in just a few months that
members of Mr. Trump's party have publicly opposed his foreign policy,
with both the House and Senate approving bipartisan legislation this
spring to cut off military assistance to Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen
using the 1973 War Powers Act, only to see it vetoed. [While the
Democrat-controlled House is also expected to block the sales, Mr. Trump
has pledged to veto the legislation, and it is unlikely that either
chamber could muster enough support to override the president's
veto]{.underline}. Seven Republicans --- not nearly enough to override a
veto --- broke from their party to disapprove of the sales to Saudi
Arabia: Senator Susan Collins of Maine, Senator Lindsey Graham of South
Carolina, Senator Mike Lee of Utah, Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas,
Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and
Senator Todd Young of Indiana.

Royal Dutch Shell, are increasingly producing natural gas, and now the

50% of U.S. electricity. By last year, that figure had dropped to 30%,
and natural gas has made up most of the difference. Here\'s an Axios
card deck primer on America\'s electricity sources. [Fueled by the oil
and natural gas boom over the last decade, API began moving into the
electricity business in late 2015]{.underline}, when it acquired another
trade group, America\'s Natural Gas Alliance, whose sole mission was to
pump up demand for natural gas. API\'s broader mission has come into
clearer focus over the last few months in three ways. Trump\'s grid

looking at the electric grid, with a focus on what the government could
do to stop coal and nuclear plants from shutting down. Energy Secretary
Rick Perry talks a lot about how environmental rules and renewable
subsidies are hurting coal and nuclear, but the biggest driver is the
bounty of cheap natural gas in stagnant electricity markets. That puts
API, a typical ally of the new administration, in an ironic position.
\"We certainly want to make sure there isn\'t some inadvertent message
coming out of this study that maybe we should be worried about having
too much natural gas,\" said Marty Durbin, executive vice president and
chief strategy officer at API. Starting last year, API began hearing
concerns from utility officials and others about fuel diversity. \"To us
that was a buzzword to say don\'t be too dependent upon natural gas,\"
Durbin said. Which is exactly what the coal industry is doing. \"We have
not beat up on natural gas I would say, but we certainly have pointed to
an over-reliance on the fuel,\" said Paul Bailey, president of the
American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity. Nuclear war [Having
largely won the battle against coal]{.underline}, [**oil and gas

mostly by natural gas. Illinois and New York have already issued
policies keeping some reactors running despite API\'s efforts, but the

Yet [[the USMCA]{.underline}]{.mark} giveth and the USMCA taketh away.
The Mexican exceptions to [removing ISDS include U.S. [oil and
gas]{.mark} companies, which [will have a variety of tools to block
environmental laws]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Chevron and Exxon Mobil, "the
number one and number two largest climate polluters in history," will
thus be protected, says Beachy.]{.underline} This is like "keeping away
all animals from the henhouse, except for foxes." Perez-Rocha further
characterized the new agreement as unfair to Mexico, calling it
"inconceivable that ISDS, while apparently scrapped for the U.S. and
Canada, remains for Mexico, creating a two tier system." Although
Obrador has agreed to abide by the new agreement, this may prove too
constraining once he is in office. Perez-Rocha thinks that when Obrador
"tries to improve things in the Mexican countryside he will realize he
will need changes" in the new agreement also. For Dey, too, the USMCA
will intrude on national sovereignty, in this case Canada's. She
explains that, despite the removal of ISDS, [[rules in the new agreement
would enable]{.mark}, for instance, a[n energy company building a tar
sands oil pipeline to influence regulations and even
legislation]{.mark}, since it will now be privy to details in advance.
[This will likely]{.mark} also [hinder]{.mark} Mexico's [transition to a
clean energy]{.mark} economy]{.underline}, says Beachy. Another key
weakness in the original NAFTA that [the USMCA would largely
maintain]{.underline} is [the ability of companies to export pollution
to countries with lower environmental standards, in this case
Mexico.]{.underline} This has happened with the dumping of lead waste,
since Mexico's standards are only a tenth as strong as those of the
United States. Globally, waste often ends up in poor countries, where it
poisons the air and water. [[Climate pollution is also being exported to
countries with lower standards as factories move to developing
countries]{.underline}]{.mark} (although, of course, it ultimately
affects us all). Dey explains that [[the agreement "doesn't]{.mark}
mention the]{.underline} \[United Nations\] [Paris climate agreement at
all,]{.underline} doesn't actually [have a section to deal with global
warming." [Without]{.underline}]{.mark} [binding [standards, it will be
virtually impossible for countries to meet their climate emissions
targets]{.mark}]{.underline}, says Beachy. Another holdover from NAFTA
is a rule that "bars the U.S. government from determining whether or not
gas exports to Mexico are in the public interest," adds Beachy. This
means that [[the USMCA will encourage fracking]{.mark} in Texas for
export to Mexico [along with additional cross-border
pipeline]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark}. Beachy also points to two steps
forward in environmental protections: Canada will no longer be mandated
to exporting tar sands oil to the United States, due to the elimination
of the proportionality rule that, under NAFTA, forced Canada to maintain
oil exports to the U.S. In addition, fishery protections will be
strengthened. Yet these two glimmers of hope only begin to point to the
robust environmental policies and enforcement standards that should be
included in free trade agreements, says Beachy.

agenda into]{.mark} one of the country\'s most [important trade
agreements]{.mark},]{.underline} environmental advocates said.
\"[Trump\'s NAFTA deal could have the effect of prolonging his polluting
legacy for years after he leaves office]{.underline},\" said Ben Beachy,
director of the Sierra Club\'s responsible trade program. The deal won
quick support from the oil and gas industry. In a statement released
Monday, a day after the agreement was announced, the American Petroleum
Institute\'s president and chief executive, Mike Sommers, urged Congress
to approve the deal. Climate and environment advocates pointed to
several ways [[the agreement could make it harder]{.underline}]{.mark}
for the U.S., Mexico and Canada **[[to reduce the greenhouse gas
emissions]{.mark} that are causing climate change.]{.underline}** The
agreement\'s text recognizes that \"air pollution is a serious threat to
public health, ecosystem integrity, and sustainable development.\" It
also makes a nod to climate change in a section on forestry, which
recognizes the important ecosystem services that forests play, including
carbon storage. But Beachy and others say [the language is weak, and the
enforcement mechanisms even weaker]{.underline}. For example, while the
agreement recognizes the problem of air pollution, it contains no
specific measures to reduce it. \"It\'s almost insulting that the
parties recognize the problem without addressing it,\" Beachy said.
Gordon Laxer, an emeritus professor of political economy at the
University of Alberta and a critic of NAFTA, called the environment
chapter \"totally useless.\" [The agreement would continue to allow
companies to move polluting practices to jurisdictions with weaker
environmental regulations.]{.underline} When the U.S. tightened limits
on lead pollution, some [companies moved lead-polluting operations to
Mexico rather than comply with the new standards. Similar [outsourcing
could occur if any of the countries were to adopt a carbon tax or limits
on greenhouse gas]{.mark} pollution]{.underline}, Beachy said. That\'s
already happening to some extent with carbon emissions. As developed
nations import more raw materials like steel and cement from China and
other countries with lower wages and looser environmental regulations,
they have effectively outsourced the emissions. One recent report found
that the U.S. is far and away the leading \"outsourcer\" of climate
pollution. Making It Easier for Polluters to Block New Regulations The
most worrisome new provisions come in a chapter called \"good regulatory
practices,\" Beachy said. The section lays out a series of measures
countries must follow with their own regulatory procedures. Under the
section, companies would be guaranteed a chance to comment on proposed
regulations across borders, and governments would have to publish data
to support to the regulations. It also says governments also would have
to develop processes to promote consideration of the burdens regulations
place on small businesses as well as any \"unnecessary restrictions on
competition.\" Beachy said this would be the first U.S. trade agreement
to guarantee companies can use this method to challenge and delay
climate or other environmental regulations. He also said it could help
entrench the Trump administration\'s anti-regulatory agenda even after
Trump leaves office. When a new U.S. government starts to restore the
health and climate protections that the Trump administration is now
erasing, it will be up against onerous rules that will make it hard to
make strong, swift changes, he said. Another provision of NAFTA that
consistently drew condemnation from public advocacy groups was a dispute
system established for corporations to challenge environmental and other
regulations. Under the system, called investor state dispute settlement,
companies can sue for damages if they claim a regulation would cost them
future profits. TransCanada, the company behind the Keystone XL
pipeline, used this clause to pursue a \$15 billion claim against the
U.S. government after President Barack Obama rejected the project. The
company dropped the suit after Trump approved the pipeline. All told,
Canada has paid nearly CAN\$220 million to U.S. investors through the
system, according to an analysis by the Canadian Center for Policy
Alternatives. While the new deal largely eliminates this system,
[American companies in several sectors---including oil and gas---will
still be able to use]{.underline} the [dispute settlement]{.underline}
system against the Mexican government. \"[[It\'s]{.mark} just [a]{.mark}
shameful [handout to oil and gas]{.mark},\"]{.underline} Beachy said.
Environmentalists say [the threat of claims has deterred officials from
adopting stricter regulations.]{.underline} Companies in the power
generation, transportation and telecommunications sectors that have
contracts with the Mexican government can also continue to use the
dispute settlement process. Blocking Challenges to Natural Gas Exports
[The new agreement would continue]{.underline} another NAFTA provision
that has long irritated environmentalists: [[the nearly automatic
approval of natural gas exports]{.mark} to Mexico]{.underline}.
Normally, opponents of gas exports can challenge a project by arguing
that it doesn\'t serve the public interest. Gas exports to Mexico are
exempt, however, and Beachy said this clause has hamstrung efforts to
generate more electricity from renewable energy sources like wind and
solar. One Change Could Help Canada Cut Emissions To the north, another
export clause environmentalists opposed would be eliminated. NAFTA had
compelled Canada to export a certain amount of oil and gas into the
U.S.---the provision was a legacy of a brief attempt by the federal
government to exert more control over its oil industry. Canadian critics
of the clause have long argued that it undermined the country\'s
sovereignty and promoted development of the Canada\'s tar sands, which
produces oil that is largely destined for the U.S. Laxer said that while
the change will not have any immediate effect, it would free a future
Canadian government to more dramatically limit its emissions and oil
production. \"It means in the 2020s and 2030s,\" he said, \"the Canadian
government could actually reduce the production of tar sands oil for
export and fracked gas.\" [Canadian offi]{.underline}cials had said
early in the trade negotiations that [a new agreement to replace NAFTA
would have to address climate change, but that largely fell by the
wayside in recent week]{.underline}s. While talks with the U.S. were
underway, Canada did add a climate clause to its trade deal with the
European Union.

#### USMCA locks in fossil fuel dependency

Help Labor, But Will Hurt the Environment," published October 8^th^,

Long after Donald Trump ceases to be President, the newly renegotiated
North American Free Trade Agreement may be harming the environment. As
Ben Beachy of the Sierra Club describes it[, [the new agreement
"will]{.underline}]{.mark} [encourage further outsourcing of pollution
and jobs, includes special handouts to some of the world's most
notorious polluters, \[and\] would help [lock in fossil fuel
dependency.]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark} Beachy was discussing the
United States, Mexico and Canada Agreement, or USMCA, a name that seems
designed to be hard to remember or know how to pronounce. The full text
of the agreement, designed to replace NAFTA, was released on October 1,
but must be verified to come into effect. Besides continuing NAFTA's
quarter century legacy of environmental degradation, [[the USMCA has new
wrinkles likely to worsen pollution. It moves backwards from current
language included in the most recent free trade agreements]{.mark}
signed by the U.S., [to protect endangered species, ocean health, and
wetlands]{.mark}, among other issues. And [it doesn't even mention
climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### USMCA expands emissions from second largest region in the world

It is no surprise that calls to renegotiate the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) have resonated with many Americans over the
years. [Numerous studies have documented the negative effects of NAFTA
on certain groups, regions and the environment in the United States,
Mexico and Canada.]{.underline} President Trump can be credited with
renegotiating NAFTA and is now pressing Congress to ratify it. Yet
according to the evidence we reviewed with our colleague Kevin Gallagher
in a recent policy brief, the revised NAFTA, now called
[the]{.underline} United Stated Mexico Canada Agreement [(USMCA), will
not restore industrial jobs, worker rights and living wages; nor will it
provide the needed protections for affordable health care and the
environment, which the original NAFTA has eroded.]{.underline} It also
introduces serious new restrictions on the right of the three
governments to regulate privacy and harmful content on the Internet.
Based on our review of the terms of the agreement and projections of its
impact, we argue that the USMCA will shift the balance further against
working households and local communities. If our interest is
sustainable, shared prosperity, the USMCA is a step in the wrong
direction. Recent research and data indicate that trade agreements have
adversely affected jobs and wages. For example, a 2016 study that looks
at the effects of NAFTA by measuring each industry's vulnerability to
Mexican imports and each locality's dependence on vulnerable industries
finds that wage growth was dramatically lower for blue-collar workers in
the most affected industries and localities, with negative effects on
service-sector workers in those localities as well. Will the USMCA
remedy the adverse distributional effects of NAFTA and avoid new
distortions? Based on the official US government study, the answer is
no. The U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) projects that the
USMCA will bring small and skewed economic gains in the U.S., including:
a one-time increase in GDP of only 0.35 percent; a one-time increase in
total employment of a small fraction of one percent, mainly in low-paid
service sector jobs; and a one-time wage increase of about a quarter of
1 percent on average. It is important to note that the USITC study finds
any positive effects at all only because it attributes economic value to
the reduction of "policy uncertainty" for investors as a result of
increased protections for firms in a few sectors, including
pharmaceuticals and information technology. Without this imputation of
value for the private sector, the study finds that the impact of USMCA
on economic growth, employment and wages will be negative. Furthermore,
the idea of policy certainty arising from the USMCA sits uncomfortably
with the recent threats to impose high tariffs on all imports from
Mexico. Turning to the specific provisions of most concern to the public
and many legislators, on labor the USMCA expands the scope of
commitments to protect labor rights but does nothing to strengthen their
enforcement, meaning that even seeming improvements will have little
impact in practice. The experience with NAFTA and subsequent U.S. free
trade agreements demonstrates that replicating the weak enforcement
provisions will mean that there is no leverage to achieve progress on
rights and wages in trading partner countries. [On environment, **the
USMCA fails to even mention climate change**, despite that the World
Trade Organization and the United Nations have shown that **trade
expansion increases carbon dioxide emissions and that North American
fossil fuel emissions are the second largest of any region in the
world**. The chapter on environment eliminates NAFTA provisions that
parties should heed commitments under M]{.underline}ultilateral
[E]{.underline}nvironmental [A]{.underline}greements [even if they
conflict with NAFTA rules.]{.underline} **[And there is a
loophole]{.underline}** (in Annex 14E of the text) [**whereby U.S. oil
and gas companies with Mexican government contracts can still sue the
Mexican government if it adopts higher environmental and public health
standards.**]{.underline} The USMCA introduces new restrictions on the
right of the parties -- including the US government -- to adopt new
regulations that would protect the public interest. For example, the
chapter on "digital trade" would prevent the U.S. from instituting new
requirements that US individuals\' personal and financial data must be
kept in the U.S. to protect it from malign or less secure handling
abroad. USMCA intellectual property protections would constrain the U.S.
(as well as Canada and Mexico) from future efforts to reduce
prescription drug prices by locking in the number of years biotechnology
companies can avoid competition based on their test data. This will
allow firms to keep high drug prices for longer periods also reducing
incentives for new research. The 2020 presidential election season is
the perfect opportunity to have a national debate about a new, more
equitable trade strategy for the country. [A trade regime suitable for
21st century challenges will need to support]{.underline}, not undermine
a more equitable and inclusive economy where costs and gains are
distributed more fairly to working households and corporations. It will
need to [support low-carbon growth paths and address pollution and
environmental degradation.]{.underline} It will also have to devise a
new generation of intellectual property rules that ensure affordable
access to medicine. A sustainable and politically acceptable trade
regime must recognize that investors' interests often run counter to the
public good and must be kept in check[**. Instead of seizing the
opportunity to devise a new trade model, the USMCA locks
in**]{.underline} and even adds to policies that have contributed to
rising inequality, stagnant wages, rising health care costs,
**[environmental degradation]{.underline}** and political disaffection.
To protect working households and their communities, Congress should
either take the time to fix the USMCA or reject it.

Raise environmental and sustainability standards in North America [The
Trump administration has pursued a damaging environmental policy
agenda]{.underline}, including through its withdrawal from the Paris
agreement, expansion of offshore drilling, and has proposed significant
defunding of vital climate and energy research programs.52 [The USMCA is
consistent with the administration's approach to environmental policy.
**While it pays lip service to the importance of environmental
standards, it fails to incorporate the meaningful standards and tools
necessary to ensure signatory compliance with domestic environmental
laws and international agreements to which they are
parties**]{.underline}.53 [Notably, it steps backwards on requirements
to comply with international environmental agreements, and omits the
necessary standards needed to address the global threat of climate
change.]{.underline}54 As with the labor chapter, enforcement, discussed
below, is also sorely lacking. Given what scientists know about the
immediate threats to the planet and their consequences for economies and
societies, [no trade agreement should fail to incorporate new, high-road
approaches to environmental standards that recognize the costs of
pollution and climate change.55 Not only should countries be discouraged
from lowering their environmental standards and enforcement to attract
trade and investment, but trade agreements should also be structured to
enable and indeed incentivize countries to raise their
standards.]{.underline} It should also sanction those who allow firms to
seek to outsource pollution to trading partner countries, which harms
both their workers and American workers. The shift in car battery
recycling from the U.S. to Mexico is an example of just this type of
dual harm.56 The agreement should also explicitly exempt from
trade-related challenges those domestic policies that are intended to
reduce or adapt to environmental harm, such as measures to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions or regulate practices such as fracking or
offshore drilling.57 This would prevent challenges to domestic policies
that otherwise would be considered violations of NAFTA rules. One
positive provision in the USMCA is that it does remove a requirement
that the United States and Canada continue to export natural resources,
including fossil fuels, based on previous years' trade, even if a
country sought to enact conservation policies. This rule in the original
NAFTA impacted Canada's ability to reduce oil sand production to meet
its international environmental commitments.58 The rule also impacts the
United States' ability in the future to dial back resource exports from
any public lands that the Trump administration opens up. The United
States trades more energy with Canada and Mexico than with the rest of
the world combined,59 and a successful NAFTA renegotiation should seize
opportunities to promote higher standards and incentives for clean
energy and efficiency among all three North American countries, such as
the appliance efficiency standards that the United States and Canada
typically harmonize on a bilateral basis.60 In addition, although none
of the NAFTA countries currently has a formal economy-wide carbon price,
a rewritten NAFTA should seek to foreclose the possibility of carbon
leakage across borders in the event one of the countries adopts such a
measure.61 It is also important to safeguard countries' other tools to
take action to address the climate crisis. Whether it's securing
climate-friendly labeling on products traded across borders in North
America or boosting climate-friendly procurement, trade agreements
should enhance a country's efforts to tackle climate change--- not
potentially limit them.62 **[Lastly, it is no small matter that Trump's
agreement contains a loophole to the reformed ISDS provisions that is
principally a special giveaway to the oil and gas sectors, which have
contracts with the government in Mexico]{.underline}**.63 That's
representative of a deeply unfortunate failure to make the threat of
climate change---as it impacts workers, communities, and the
planet---central to a new vision for North American economic
cooperation. Enforce labor and environmental standards Not only is it
important to have stronger labor and environmental standards, but [any
renegotiated agreement should have effective enforcement mechanisms,
ensuring that all countries meet these standards. While the USMCA
proposes to enforce labor and environmental standards through the
general dispute settlement procedures, that is likely to be
inadequate.]{.underline} State-to-state enforcement has a poor history
of effectiveness.64 In part, this is because of a loophole in the
original NAFTA that enabled countries to avoid participating in a
dispute settlement panel---a problem that remains in the USMCA. More
broadly, labor and the environment often get pushed aside by
governmental priorities in state-to-state relationships. Lastly, cases
that require evaluating the compliance of an entire economy can be
difficult to prove and force meaningful, timely change. Given the
complexity of the issues surrounding labor and environmental matters, as
well as the limited resources of the individuals and organizations they
affect, an independent authority is needed to enable investigations to
be conducted when violations are reported. It ought to be independent,
well-staffed, and with sufficient authority to investigate or monitor
compliance when remedies are agreed on for violations.65 The need for an
effective approach to enforcement has been recognized by progressive
policy makers for some time. One important idea that some have floated
is an inspection, compliance, and exclusion system modeled on the
U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement's timber annex.66 The annex gave the
United States the power to verify that Peruvian lumber had been produced
legally, including provisions permitting on-site inspections in Peru. It
also empowers customs officers to block illegal products at the border
and to prohibit future shipments. Illegal logging of Peruvian timber
remains a serious problem that the U.S. has only begun to address, but
were the authorities and inspections strengthened and the enforcement
made more automatic, this could be a potential pathway towards enforcing
standards that are important to workers in the United States, Canada,
and Mexico.67 In addition, private parties ought to be able to
supplement governmental actions and directly challenge violations of
labor and environmental provisions of trade agreements. Strong private
rights of action, which are present in U.S. trade remedy law
(antidumping and countervailing duty cases), could be deployed to help
ensure that labor and environmental protections and rights are
authentic. One way to accomplish this is to insert labor and
environmental standards into the way the U.S. Department of Commerce (or
relevant trade ministry) calculates the normal value for a particular
import.68 However, it is important to remember that private actions,
including trade remedy cases, cannot replace swift and certain state
enforcement. Private cases can be expensive and difficult to bring
because of barriers to needed information. They also are limited in
their ability to produce systemic changes throughout an economy, such as
securing union organizing rights. But they and similar mechanisms offer
a useful way to pressure improved behavior in trading partners and could
signal to the United States Trade Representative that broader action is
needed.

[Environmental groups say the version of the agreement Trump signed last
fall included **vague and unenforceable language that gave U.S. trading
partners too much leeway**. They want Democrats to highlight
environmental concerns alongside other provisions]{.underline} ---such
as those on labor and prescription drugs --- that House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi and other Democratic leaders are demanding to secure their
support. "The House has a responsibility and an opportunity to stand up
for trade agreements that actually protect people and the planet," said
Ben Beachy, director of the Sierra Club's Living Economy Program.
[Environmental groups want binding environmental provisions ￼for
climate, water and land pollution.]{.underline} "This international
trade agreement offers a big opportunity to raise awareness about the
intersection of climate and trade issues. And it gives us another chance
to remind the American public about the importance of the Paris climate
agreement," Dan West, legislative advocate for the Natural Resources
Defense Council, said at the June 4 briefing. They say [the latest deal
includes only a few improvements from the original North American Free
Trade Agreement, which took effect in 1994.]{.underline} "It's crazy to
think that it's already June and we're halfway through 2019, but it's
even crazier to realize that we're a fifth of the way through the 21st
century and our international trade agreements still aren't even
acknowledging the threat of global warming," West said. Congress will
have to decide in the coming months whether to sign off on the agreement
or withdraw it from the fast-track process. Demands for changes could
lead to back-and-forth negotiating that could last months or even years.
Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee this spring expressed
their disappointment that [the USMCA deal didn't force other countries
to sign onto seven international environmental agreements.]{.underline}
[The trade deal's environment chapter **lacked provisions directed at
combating climate change**]{.underline}. The Trump administration said
in a recent document submitted to Congress on May 30 that it intends to
work with Congress to change U.S. law to ensure enforcement of the
environment chapter. The lawmakers [said the deal also falls short on
rules against illegal trading of animals and plant products, failing to
bring other countries close to current U.S. law on those fronts. More
broadly, they expressed alarm that **the deal may not hold other
countries accountable for breaking environmental rules.** "This
procedural design will, we fear, doom the environment commitments in the
new Agreement to be **as ineffective as the provisions in the existing
NAFTA,"**]{.underline} the Democrats said in an April letter to U.S.
Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.
