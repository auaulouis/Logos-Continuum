#### Restricting and regulating arms trade is an extension of post-colonial governmentality -- western states have always framed this regulation as a way to strategically further their interests and "civilize" colonial subjects

**Cooper** **'18** (Neil, PhD, Professor of International Relations and
Security Studies and Head of Peace Studies & International Development
at University of Bradford, Race, Sovereignty, and Free Trade: Arms Trade
Regulation and Humanitarian Arms Control in the Age of Empire, Journal
of Global Security Studies, 10.1093/jogss/ogy013)CN

However, **[focusing only on the]{.underline}** operation of
**[prohibitory regulatory norms]{.underline}** **[obscures the way arms
trade]{.underline}** **[regulation also constituted a specific colonial
form of arms control as governmentality, whereby mechanisms of
prohibition and prescription]{.underline}** **[were both put to the
service of governing which peoples could legitimately use what kinds of
arms]{.underline}**. Of course, efforts to manage arms flows to
potentially unruly colonial subjects by constantly seeking to balance
permission and proscription were neither completely effective nor ever
effectively complete. First, efforts at restraint were perennially
subject to strategies of evasion undertaken by local actors operating
with their own normative and cartographic understandings (Tagliacozzo
2005; Mathew 2016). Second, [arms trade regulation was a contested
terrain over which advocates of permission and advocates of restraint
often clashed]{.underline}. For example, [pressures for restraint were
offset by pressures to use the provision of arms to secure
access]{.underline} to [markets]{.underline} [and the
loyalty]{.underline} or security [of allies]{.underline} in a context of
intra-European competition **[to maintain and expand formal and informal
empires]{.underline}** (Grant 2007; Chew 2012). [Policy on the
ground]{.underline}, therefore, often [appeared
contradictory]{.underline}. **[Nevertheless]{.underline}**,
**[proponents of permission and proscription generally agreed on the
broad goals of policy---to maintain imperial influence and imperial
order]{.underline}**. As will be illustrated below, [they agreed even
more]{.underline} [on the broader logics in which arguments for
permission and proscription were to be located]{.underline}---**[those
governing sovereignty, free trade, development, and the standard of
civilization.]{.underline}** For example, the Brussels Act certainly
failed to prevent a substantial arms trade into Abyssinia and Somalia
where, by 1908, British officials considered the act had "completely
broken down"29 largely as a result of French support for a profitable
arms trade through French-controlled Djibouti. In this case, [colonial
norms of sovereignty provided the regulatory space for
proliferation]{.underline}. The legal legitimacy of this transit trade
was enshrined by Article Ten of the Brussels Act, which, somewhat
ironically, had been vigorously promoted by the British. [This affirmed
the right of]{.underline} inland [territories "under the sovereignty or
protectorate" of another signatory power to acquire arms via the
territory of a coastal power]{.underline}, and Italy had previously
announced Abyssinia's adhesion to the agreement. Compounding the irony,
at one point in the negotiations the French had suggested the conference
had "no power to impose a right of transit on any Sovereign state."30
Enforcement of both the arms and slave trade regulations of Brussels was
also hampered by French refusal to permit searches of sea vessels flying
the French flag. Arms smuggling dhow owners operating in both the Red
Sea and the Persian Gulf quickly realized the French flag represented "a
license to traffic" (Mathew 2016, 35), as it made each dhow an "island
of colonial sovereignty" (ibid., 34) and therefore immune to search.
This is not to imply sovereignty norms offered an unfettered license to
trade. **[The arms provisions of the Brussels Act were ultimately
predicated on the fact that European powers exercised "rights of
sovereignty]{.underline}**" (Article Nine) **[in their colonial
possessions.]{.underline}** Thus, **[the act and its implementation was
suffused with norms of sovereignty]{.underline}** **[that]{.underline}**
both **[underpinned restrictions on the arms trade and provided the
regulatory spaces permitting their circumvention]{.underline}**.
Similarly, [both the advocates for free trade in arms in the spaces of
empire and the advocates of restriction]{.underline} [crafted their
arguments by reference to]{.underline} the [shared ideational frames of
free trade, development, and the standard of
civilization---]{.underline}each heavily imbricated in the other. [In
Africa]{.underline}, for example, free trade advocates argued [the offer
of arms was essential for recruiting African laborers]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [that arms proliferation would speed the depopulation
of local wildlife, thus hastening the day when natives switched from
hunting and alcohol to legitimate trade]{.underline} (Storey 2008, 196).
Conversely, [proponents of restriction]{.underline} such as Alexander
Mackay (1890, 42) of the Church Missionary Society [deplored the fact
that "in the name of Christianity, free trade and civilization we
see]{.underline} firewater and [firearms pouring in every
port]{.underline} \[in Africa\]." However, for Mackay, [the solution lay
not only in "forbidding the import of arms]{.underline} and ammunition"
**[but in promoting legitimate trade amongst Africans,]{.underline}**
**["developing the resources of the country, and . . . promoting
internal peace]{.underline}**" so "**[the natives will . . . busy
themselves with growing whatever they can get a fair price for instead
of fighting]{.underline}**" (Letter to The Times, May 8, 1889). In this
sense, **[the Brussels Act represented the archetype of regulation in
the spaces of empire]{.underline}**, [**combining restrictions on the**
**arms**]{.underline} and liquor **[trades with calls for]{.underline}**
the **[development]{.underline}** of "agricultural labour and . . . the
industrial arts" amongst native populations (Article Two). At the same
time, the precise ways in which these twin processes of grafting and
counter-grafting played out varied from region to region and over time.
For example, in Singapore, policy from the 1820s onwards oscillated
between permission and proscription, as free trade and merchant pressure
on the one hand and concerns about the destabilizing impact of the
firearms trade on the other hand were weighed in different ways at
different times (Tagliacozzo 2005, 270; Chew 2012, 174--79). At Muscat,
commercial treaties between the sultan and various powers (particularly
the French) enshrining free trade severely hampered Britain's ability to
curtail the trade in the Persian Gulf. This was only finally resolved by
the aforementioned 1913 agreement between Britain and France. Thus, free
trade norms were constantly exposed to serial processes of grafting and
counter-grafting. Nevertheless, [as the nineteenth century merged into
the early twentieth century, arms trade regulation in the spaces of
empire was increasingly seen as consonant with a dominant imaginary of
liberal market norms]{.underline} (Mathew 2016). This is not to downplay
the pressures for imperial powers to supply arms to local allies, or the
way **[broader colonial conceptions of economic and geostrategic
interest militated against cooperation to limit the arms
traffic]{.underline}** as at Djibouti and Muscat.31 However, [such
factors]{.underline} ultimately [illustrate the way in which
particular]{.underline} assemblages of [norms]{.underline}, formal and
informal practices, responses to evasions, and norm-derived conceptions
of interest [constituted colonial practices of arms control as
governmentality.]{.underline} Understood **[in this way, oscillations in
policy in the same region or between different spheres of colonial
interest reflected the attempt]{.underline}** (always imperfect) **[to
manage arms flows according to where people were placed in the racially
inflected triple hierarchies of civilization, loyalty, and utility to
imperial power]{.underline}**---[hierarchies that could be either
mutually reinforcing or mutually opposed depending on
circumstance]{.underline}. **[Pressures to arm or disarm
locals]{.underline}** also **[illustrated how judgements about what
constituted]{.underline}** **[interest were predicated on a particular
moral economy in which European norms of racial superiority and
imperialism framed the standards of appropriate behavior of the
era]{.underline}** (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998, 892) **[and the fluid
but always subordinate identities of the other.]{.underline}**

#### The alternative is a decolonial demand, an insurrection against the logic of elimination that drives the clearing of the land and reproduction of colonial relations in international relations

**Verracini 16** (Lorenzo Veracini is an associate Professor in History
at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia. His
research focuses on the comparative history of colonial systems and
settler colonialism. (2016) "Afterword: a history of the settler
colonial present, Settler Colonial Studies", 6:2, 174-179, DOI:
10.1080/00048623.2015.1024304//JrH)\
A type of [possession that systematically disavows]{.underline} previous
[relationships to the land]{.underline}, the [pervasive influence of
settler colonial geographies]{.underline}, [projects of
elimination]{.underline} that target indigenous socio-reproductive
capacities, the pervasive influence of specifically [settler colonial
violent attacks against indigenous and exogenous alterities,
and]{.underline} an old/new type of [capitalist
accumulation]{.underline} that 'indigenises' colonial subjectivities:
**[this is the settler colonial present.]{.underline}** However, as they
critically analyse the settler colonial present, these papers
[also]{.underline} suggest **[ways out of the settler colonial
relation]{.underline}**. They [identify its specific
structures]{.underline}. They recommend that we [challenge notions of
possession that negate the legitimate claims of prior
owners]{.underline}, that sustain indigenous isolation, and that prevent
the social reproduction of indigenous communities. They challenge [the
ongoing power of]{.underline} typically [settler colonial narratives,
the permanence of specifically settler colonial modes of violence,
and]{.underline} ongoing [processes of accumulation by
dispossession]{.underline}. Collectively, the authors contributing to
this collection propose **[a decolonial strategy]{.underline}**. As a
way to conclude, I want to very briefly add to this strategy. The
[decolonisation of settler colonial forms should begin from the
appraisal of the settler colonial 'situation'.]{.underline} **[A
fundamental and unrelenting demand]{.underline}** that indigenous people
'go die' ultimately envisages a non-relation. Hypothetical settler
departure, however, would also constitute a non-relation. [A decolonised
post-settler colonial relation must be ongoing]{.underline}. If settler
colonialism is fundamentally characterised, to use Patrick Wolfe's
terminology and framework, by settlers that 'come to stay' and by an
unrelenting 'logic of elimination', the way out needs to turn the former
against the latter[. Settlers must renounce and denounce the logic of
elimination]{.underline}. For this they need indigenous leadership.

### Ontology 

#### Settler colonialism is an ongoing project that animates US statecraft and hegemony crushing dissent and guarantees endless war making 

**Sangarasivam 17** (Yamuna Sangarasivam is Associate Professor of
Anthropology at Nazareth College. (2017) "Ecological ontologies of
sovereignty and insecurity: settler colonial logics of national
security", Critical Studies on Security, 5:2, 203-206, DOI:
10.1080/21624887.2017.1320880)

[National security is]{.underline} an [ontological and
epistemological]{.underline} reality [founded on settler colonial
logics]{.underline}. [Security becomes a state of existence and a way of
knowing democracy]{.underline} as [predicated on an indefinite sense of
insecurity]{.underline}, which in turn [authorises a monopoly on
legitimate violence to preserve and]{.underline} persevere in the
demonstration of [citizenship and national belonging to white
nation]{.underline} states that are [forged in histories of colonial
invasion, genocide, theft of land, slavery and]{.underline} the
protracted [occupation]{.underline} of indigenous territories. What if
we observe [national]{.underline} [security]{.underline}
[as]{.underline} a collection of stories -- as the [mythologies of white
nation states]{.underline} that [are animating the settler colonial
logics of imperialist wars]{.underline}? [These 'official mythologies of
white nation-states' are rooted in the settler colonial
logics]{.underline} that Sherene Razack (2000 , 128-- 129) identifies as
[' narratives of innocence']{.underline} : through dint of hard work,
the settler conquered the wilderness; the colonizer civilized the
natives. In this era of globalization ... whites must now contend with
the disorder and chaos wrought by natives left to their own devices
after decolonization. The chaos spills over from the lands of the South
when migrants and refugees 'invade' and 'color' the spaces of the white
North. [Establishing white supremacy as the ideological **foundation**
of North American and European national security]{.underline}, renowned
early twentieth-century British-Australian scholar, Gilbert Murray
proclaimed (quoted in Sanjek \[1994\] 1996, 1): There is in the world a
hierarchy of races.... \[T\]hose nations which eat more, claim more, and
get higher wages, will direct and rule the others, and the lower work of
the world will tend in the long-run to be done by the lower breeds of
man. This much we of the ruling colour will no doubt accept as obvious.
[As ontological and epistemological realities of settler colonial
logics, these mythologies of white supremacy inform national security as
a state of existence that becomes an inexorable part of a coloniser' s
identity]{.underline}. Ethnographic methodologies invite researchers to
grapple with these realities and the consequences of critical inquiry
that endeavours to understand national security as a method of
perception and participation, a method of knowing and being a settler
citizen of colonising state regimes. Ethnographic field methods invite
us to [witness the politics of knowledge production through an awareness
of national security as a state of existence that informs a method of
perceiving the experiences of citizenship and national belonging in
conjunction with its opposites -- indefinite displacement and not
belonging through experiences of,]{.underline} for example: [racial
discrimination, forced migration, extraordinary rendition, torture and
incarceration, soldiers' suicides and suicide bombings, beheadings,
drone strikes, and dogs]{.underline} [bites]{.underline} exposing the
flesh and blood of people exercising their first amendment rights to
[protest a militarised capitalist enterprise that channels the
insatiable desire for fossil fuel to]{.underline} be delivered through
the Dakota Access Pipeline, which consequently pollutes the waters of
the Missouri River that sustains the lives of thousands of Americans.
They call themselves water protectors -- hundreds of people, including
veteran soldiers of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, who joined in
solidarity to become and belong to the Standing Rock nation as
protectors of ecological sovereignty and security against the
militarised expansion of the pipeline. [They are perceived as a threat
to national security.]{.underline} The state situated the protestors as
the enemy against which it was required to wage war by deploying local
and national law enforcement officers and private security contractors
with attack dogs, water hoses in freezing temperatures, rubber bullets,
pepper sprays, tear gas and concussion grenades to provide security for
the capitalist project of building the pipeline. These techniques
deployed to contain and neutralise the resistance of civilian protests
to the Pipeline are examples of the normalised, phenomenological
features of national security.

#### **Reject settler subjectivity -- the affirmative views settlement as one-off event, that trades off with a structural analysis of the ways in which the logic of elimination manifests in the political**

**Rifkin 14** -- Associate Professor of English & WGS @ UNC-Greensboro

(Mark, 'Settler Common Sense: Queerness and Everyday Colonialism in the
American Renaissance,' pp. 7-10)

If nineteenth-century American literary studies tends to focus on the
ways Indians enter the narrative frame and the kinds of meanings and
associa- tions they bear, [recent attempts to theorize settler
colonialism have sought to **shift attention from its effects on
Indigenous subjects** to its implications for **nonnative political
attachments, forms of inhabitance, and modes of being**]{.underline},
illuminating and [tracking the **pervasive operation of settlement as a
system**]{.underline}. In Settler Colonialism and the Transformation of
Anthropology, Patrick Wolfe argues, "Settler colonies were (are)
premised on the elimination of native societies. The split tensing
reflects a determinate feature of settler colonization. The colonizers
come to stay---**[invasion is a structure not an event]{.underline}**"
(2).6 He suggests that [a "logic of elimination" drives settler
governance and sociality]{.underline}, describing "[the settler-colonial
will]{.underline}" as "a historical force that [ultimately derives from
the primal drive to expansion]{.underline} that is generally glossed as
capitalism" (167), and in "Settler Colonialism and the Elimination of
the Native," he observes that "[elimination is an **organizing principle
of settler-colonial society** rather than a one-off (and superceded)
occurrence]{.underline}" (388). Rather than being superseded after an
initial moment/ period of conquest, colonization persists since "[the
logic of elimination marks a return whereby **the native repressed
continues to structure settler- colonial society**]{.underline}" (390).
In Aileen Moreton-Robinson's work, whiteness func- tions as the central
way of understanding the domination and displacement of Indigenous
peoples by nonnatives.7 In "Writing Off Indigenous Sover- eignty," she
argues, "As a regime of power, patriarchal white sovereignty operates
ideologically, materially and discursively to reproduce and main- tain
its investment in the nation as a white possession" (88), and in "Writ-
ing Off Treaties," she suggests, "[**At an ontological level the
structure of subjective possession** occurs through the imposition of
one's will-to-be on the thing which is perceived to lack will, thus it
is **open to being possessed**]{.underline}," such that "[possession . .
. forms]{.underline} part of **[the ontological structure of white
subjectivity]{.underline}**" (83--84). For Jodi Byrd, the deployment of
Indianness as a mobile figure works as the principal mode of U.S.
settler colonialism. She observes that "[colonization and racialization
. . . have **often been conflated**," in ways that]{.underline} "tend to
be sited along the axis of inclusion/exclusion" and that "**[misdirect
and cloud attention from the underlying structures of settler
colonialism]{.underline}**" (xxiii, xvii). She argues that [settlement
works through the translation of indigeneity as Indianness]{.underline},
casting place-based political collec- tivities as (racialized)
populations subject to U.S. jurisdiction and manage- ment: "[the Indian
is left nowhere and everywhere within the ontological premises through
which U.S. empire orients]{.underline}, imagines, and critiques
[itself]{.underline} "; "[ideas of]{.underline} Indians and [Indianness
have served as **the ontological ground through which U.S. settler
colonialism enacts itself**]{.underline} " (xix)

#### The affirmative mystifies ongoing [logics of elimation that]{.underline} render indigenous and black bodies disposable

**Paperson 17** (La, also K. Wayne Yang, an associate professor of
ethnic studies at the University of California, San Diego. "A Third
University Is Possible" June 2017)

Settler colonialism is about the land. Yet, [technologies to make land
into property also remake Indigenous African bodies. Land is the prime
concern of settler colonialism, contexts in which the colonizer comes to
a "new" place not only to seize and exploit but to stay, making that
"new" place his permanent home.]{.underline} Settler colonialism thus
complicates the center--periphery model that was classically used to
describe colonialism, wherein an imperial center, the "metropole,"
dominates distant colonies, the "periphery." Typically, one thinks of
European colonization of Africa, India, the Caribbean, the Pacific
Islands, in terms of external colonialism, also called exploitation
colonialism, where land and human beings are recast as natural resources
for primitive accumulation: coltan, petroleum, diamonds, water, salt,
seeds, genetic material, chattel. Theories named as "settler colonial
studies" had a resurgence beginning around
2006.[\[2\]](https://manifold.umn.edu/read/7ba69a54-7131-4598-9fec-815890725d91/section/06ac5ab1-761c-43da-8a6a-0cb7ecc1760b#en23)
However, the analysis of settler colonialism is actually not new, only
often ignored within Western critiques of
empire.[\[3\]](https://manifold.umn.edu/read/7ba69a54-7131-4598-9fec-815890725d91/section/06ac5ab1-761c-43da-8a6a-0cb7ecc1760b#en24)
The critical literatures of the colonized have long positioned the
violence of settlement as a prime feature in colonial life as well as in
global arrangements of power. We can see this in Franz Fanon's
foundational critiques of colonialism. Whereas Fanon's work is often
generalized for its diagnoses of anti/colonial violence and the
racialized psychoses of colonization upon colonized and colonizer, Fanon
is also talking about settlement as the particular feature of French
colonization in Algeria. For Fanon, the violence of French colonization
in Algeria arises from settlement as a spatial immediacy of empire: the
geospatial collapse of metropole and colony into the same time and
place. On the "selfsame land" are spatialized white immunity and
racialized violation, non-Native desires for freedom, Black life, and
Indigenous
relations.[\[4\]](https://manifold.umn.edu/read/7ba69a54-7131-4598-9fec-815890725d91/section/06ac5ab1-761c-43da-8a6a-0cb7ecc1760b#en25)
**[Settler colonialism is too often thought of as "what happened" to
Indigenous people. This kind of thinking confines the experiences of
Indigenous people, their critiques of settler colonialism, their
decolonial imaginations, to an unwarranted historicizing parochialism,
as if settler colonialism were a past event that "happened to" Native
peoples and not generalizable to non-Natives.Actually, settler
colonialism is something that "happened for" settlers.Indeed, it is
happening for them/us right now.]{.underline}** Wa Thiong'o's question
of how instead of why directs us to think of land tenancy laws, debt,
and [the privatization of land as settler colonial technologies that
enable the "eventful" history of plunder and disappearance. Property law
is a settler colonial technology. **The weapons that enforce it, the
knowledge institutions that legitimize it, the financial institutions
that operationalize it, are also technologies**. Like all technologies,
they evolve and spread. Recasting land as property means severing
Indigenous peoples from land. This separation, what Hortense Spillers
describes as "the loss of Indigenous name/land" for
Africans-turned-chattel, recasts Black Indigenous people as black bodies
for biopolitical disposal: who will be moved where, who will be murdered
how, who will be machinery for what, and who will be made property for
whom.[\[5\]](https://manifold.umn.edu/read/7ba69a54-7131-4598-9fec-815890725d91/section/06ac5ab1-761c-43da-8a6a-0cb7ecc1760b#en26)
In the alienation of land from life, alienable rights are produced: the
right to own (property), the right to law (protection through
legitimated violence), the right to govern (supremacist sovereignty),
the right to have rights (humanity). **In a word, what is produced is
whiteness.**]{.underline}Moreover, it is not just human beings who are
refigured in the schism. [Land and nonhumans become alienable
properties, a move that first alienates land from its own sovereign
life. Thus we can speak of the various technologies required to create
and maintain these separations, these alienations: Black from
Indigenous, human from nonhuman, land from
life.[\[6\]](https://manifold.umn.edu/read/7ba69a54-7131-4598-9fec-815890725d91/section/06ac5ab1-761c-43da-8a6a-0cb7ecc1760b#en27)]{.underline}
"How?" is a question you ask if you are concerned with the mechanisms,
not just the motives, of colonization. **[Instead of settler colonialism
as an ideology, or as a history, you might consider settler colonialism
as a set of technologies---a frame that could help you to forecast
colonial next operations and to plot decolonial
directions.]{.underline}** This chapter proceeds with the following
insights. [(1) The settler--native--slave triad does not describe
identities. The triad---an analytic mainstay of settler colonial
studies---digs a pitfall of identity that not only chills collaborations
but also implies that the racial will be the solution. (2) Technologies
are trafficked. Technologies generate patterns of social relations to
land. Technologies mutate, and so do these relationships. Colonial
technologies travel. In tracing technologies' past and future
trajectories, we can connect how settler colonial and antiblack
technologies circulate in transnational arenas. (3) Land---not just
people---is the biopolitical
target.[\[7\]](https://manifold.umn.edu/read/7ba69a54-7131-4598-9fec-815890725d91/section/06ac5ab1-761c-43da-8a6a-0cb7ecc1760b#en28)
The examples are many: fracking, biopiracy, damming of rivers and
flooding of valleys,]{.underline} the carcasses of pigs that die from
the feed additive ractopamine and are allowable for harvest by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration. The subjugation of land and nonhuman life
to deathlike states in order to support "human" life is a "biopolitics"
well beyond the Foucauldian conception of biopolitical as
governmentality or the neoliberal disciplining of modern, bourgeois,
"human" subject. (4) (Y)our task is to theorize in the break, that is,
to refuse the master narrative that technology is loyal to the master,
that (y)our theory has a Eurocentric origin. [Black studies, Indigenous
studies, and Other-ed studies have already made their breaks with
Foucault (over biopolitics), with Deleuze and Guatarri (over assemblages
and machines), and with Marx (over life and primitive accumulation). (5)
Even when they are dangerous, understanding technologies provides us
some pathways for decolonizing work. We can identify projects of
collaboration on decolonial technologies. Colonizing mechanisms are
evolving into new forms, and they might be subverted toward decolonizing
operations. The Settler--Native--Slave Triad Does Not Describe
Identities One of the main interventions of settler colonial studies has
been to insist that the patterning of social relations is shaped by
colonialism's thirst for land and thus is shaped to fit modes of
empire.]{.underline} Because colonialism is a perverted affair, our
relationships are also warped into complicitous arrangements of
violation, trespass, and collusion with its mechanisms. For Fanon, the
psychosis of colonialism arises from the patterning of violence into the
binary relationship between the immune humanity of the white settler and
the impugned humanity of the native. For Fanon, the supremacist "right"
to create settler space that is immune from violence, and the "right" to
abuse the body of the Native to maintain white immunity, this is the
spatial and fleshy immediacy of settler colonialism. Furthermore[, the
"humanity" of the settler is constructed upon his agency over the land
and nature. As Maldonado-Torres explains, "I think, therefore I am" is
actually an articulation of "I conquer, therefore I am]{.underline}," a
sense of identity posited upon the harnessing of nature and its
"natural"
people.[\[8\]](https://manifold.umn.edu/read/7ba69a54-7131-4598-9fec-815890725d91/section/06ac5ab1-761c-43da-8a6a-0cb7ecc1760b#en29)
[This creates a host of post+colonial problems that have come to define
modernity. Because the humanity of the settler is predicated on his
ability to "write the world," to make history upon and over the natural
world, the colonized is instructed to make her claim to humanity by
similarly acting on the world or, more precisely, acting in
his]{.underline}.

#### We cannot observe Settler Colonialism's structural invasion via logic of elimination as an event, but rather a matrix of relations and conditions that define life within the settler-state. Settlement serves as the ontological pre-condition to how bodies are racialized and minoritized on stolen land.

[This special issue on settler colonialism and cultural production seeks
to intervene in cultural studies, drawing on Indigenous studies and
approaches to analyzing settler colonialism to untangle the cultural and
material work of settlement as a foundational solipsism of U.S. and
global relations of power and control]{.underline}. Cultural studies'
**[theorizations of race, space, and colonization have yet to adequately
grapple with the politics of settlement on Indigenous
land]{.underline}**. [Critical cultural studies **projects are often
grounded in assumptions that** presume and **erase settler colonial
epistemologies** so that **even in our best attempts to challenge
systems of exclusion and privilege unwittingly reify the normatively
White Enlightenment subject**]{.underline}, and the settler colonial
grounds on which it is formed. For Chickasaw theorist, Jodi Byrd, [the
production of critical projects like cultural studies circulates through
the erasure of Indigenous genocide and conquest.]{.underline} Byrd's
(2011) careful genealogical critique reveals that "**[prevailing
understandings of race and racialization within U.S. post-colonial,
area, and queer studies depend upon an historical aphasia of the
conquest of indigenous people]{.underline}**s" (p. 24). The methods
culture critics deploy, like genealogy and deconstruction, presume, and
participate in the erasure of Indigenous peoples as modern subjects, but
rather as "located outside temporality and presence," which is
particularly egregious in the "face of the very present and ongoing
colonization of indigenous lands, resources, and lives" (Byrd, 2011, p.
6). Byrd (2011) underscores how "**[the savage and the 'Indian' . . .
serves as the ground and pre-condition for structuralism and formalism,
as well as their posts" and persists as a "an undeconstructable core
within critical theories that attempt to dismantle how knowledge, power,
and language function"]{.underline}** (p. 10). The figure of the Native
as the "undeconstructable core" within the knowledge/power/language
formation of cultural studies circulates as an undigested subtext.
[**Our unwitting reproduction of settler logics are foundational to our
theorizations of racial, (post)colonial, and material formations as our
knowledge production** not only **erases the identities** experience
**of first nations peoples** **but also perpetuates and remains
complicit with settler projects: the "disappearance" of Native
peoples**, **the theft and privatization of land for profit, and the
ongoing genocide of Indigenous people**]{.underline}. In part, then,
this special issue aims to offer the field of cultural studies host of
theoretical resources and methodological approaches to settler colonial
studies as a way to deepen our treatment of settler cultural formations
to begin the dirty work of deconstructing the rhetorical and material
practices of settler colonialism. For instance, Whiteness must be more
fully interrogated as a settler project, especially within U.S.
contexts; **[imperialism must be theorized as productive of, but not the
same as, settler colonialism;]{.underline}** popular cultural studies
should be radically rethought through a critical examination of
pervasive representations that disappear Indigenous peoples. **[Works in
settler colonial studies may be at their best when they engage
Indigenous theorizations of genocide and survivance, especially in
conversation with Black theorizations of antiBlackness and
futurity]{.underline}**. As such, [settler colonial studies provides a
vibrant examination of power relations in its extensive treatment of
such topics as sovereignty, nationalism and nation formation; imperial
formations, genocide, removal, colonial legacies; the politics of land,
landedness, space and place; intersectionality, queer theory, gender
studies; race, racialization, White supremacy; affect studies;
futurities, materialities, environmentalism, new materialism; and
tourism and travel.]{.underline} New approaches to a variety of the
above topics are of urgent importance to cultural studies practitioners.
Yet, with the exception of a handful of scholars, [treatments of settler
colonialism have largely remained undertheorized in cultural studies,
where concepts like "settlers" and "settlement" appear as secondary
categories---if they appear at all. For instance, while postcolonial
critics have attended to settler colonialism in their theorizations of
nation-state and imperial formations, the "post" remains a vexed term in
Native studies, where any move to place colonialism in the past risks
reifying the myth of the disappearing Indian and the naturalized
settler]{.underline}. While Indigenous studies and postcolonial studies
draw on a similar cannon (i.e., Frantz Fanon) and attend to related
questions of thinking and imaging beyond the colonial, the fields have
yet to build strong ties (Byrd & Rothberg, 2011). In spite of
theoretical and political affinities, the conversations between these
fields, Jodi Byrd and Michael Rothenberg argue, have "largely been
foreclosed" (p. 4). Among other reasons, Indigenous scholars are
suspicious of the "post" in relation to "colonial" for "confronting the
ongoing colonization of native lands remains at the top of the agenda
for indigenous peoples" (Byrd & Rothberg, 2011, p. 4). Indigenous
scholars also question the "fit" between "models developed as a response
to colonization of Indian subcontinent and Africa" and those that emerge
in response to settler state formations (Byrd & Rothberg, 2011, p. 4).
Unlike the postcolonial, the project of decolonization is centrally
concerned with [the settlement of Indigenous land, which is "rooted in
the elimination of Indigenous peoples, polities and relationships from
and with the land," making the field "conceptually distinct from other
kinds of communication]{.underline}" (Snelgrove et al., 2014, pp. 7-8).
[In their essay, "Decolonization Is Not a Metaphor," Eve Tuck and K.
Wayne Yang argue that we must interrogate our treatments of
"decolonization" as a noun (decolonization), instead of a verb
(decolonize).]{.underline} **[When we prioritize social justice, civil
rights, and equality efforts, it is easy to elide the more uncomfortable
work of examining questions of landedness, racial categories, and
settlement. In the process, we turn "decolonization" into a
metaphor]{.underline}**. [By centering settler colonialism,]{.underline}
Tuck and Yang (2012) rethink racial categories in terms of a "triad
structure of settler-Indigenous-chattel slave," arguing **["the
decolonial desires of white, nonwhite, immigrant, postcolonial, and
oppressed people, can similarly be entangled in resettlement,
reoccupation, and reinhabitation that actually further settler
colonialism]{.underline}**" (p. 2). But this rethinking is not a
remaking of racial categories. [The triad, at least in Tuck and Yang's
configuration, is not a closed set; it is not trying to explain
everything]{.underline}. Cramped into a footnote on page 7 and taken up
more fully elsewhere (Tuck, Guess, & Sultan, 2014), Tuck and Yang (2012)
[caution that settler-Indigenous-chattel slave are not analogues--- that
is, they are not uniform units that are just a little different from
each other]{.underline}. [Indigeneity precedes and supersedes settler
colonialism; chattel slavery is not an identity, not a stand-in for
Blackness]{.underline}. Tiffany Lethabo [King]{.underline} (2014) [has
rightly pointed out the limits of theorizing Black life as fungible, and
the pained logics of cohering Blackness as labor]{.underline}. King
(2014) observes, [While labor as a discourse may work for non-Black and
nonNative people of color as a way of interpellating themselves within
settler colonial relations, it does not explain Black presence, Black
labor or Black use in White settler nationstates]{.underline}. Theories
that attempt to triangulate Blackness into the Settler/Native antagonism
in White settler states do so by positing Blackness as the labor force
that helps make the settler landscape possible**[. It is true that Black
labor literally tills, fences in and cultivates the settler's
land]{.underline}**. However, this singular analysis both obscures the
issue of [Black fungibility and reduces Blackness to a mere tool of
settlement rather than a constitutive element of settler colonialism's
conceptual order.]{.underline} (n.p.) [Thus, the triad is insufficient
to describe anything but a set of relations, a set of antagonisms
(Wilderson, 2010). And they are not just a set of relationships to one
another but also relationships to place. In attending to these
relations, possibilities for practice and politics emerge.]{.underline}
Possibilities for (contingent) collaborations, (re)interpretations,
remixes, and audiences make themselves known. [**Formulations of
relationships structured by settler colonialism** **underscore the
necessity to move beyond** a mantra of gender, race, class, sexuality,
and other **intersections of power** **to explore how racial categories
interact with occupation**, the extraction of wealth, **and the ongoing
settlement of land that continues to dispossess Native populations
because** "**colonial subjects who are displaced by external
colonialism, as well as racialized and minoritized by internal
colonialism, still occupy and settle stolen Indigenous
land**]{.underline}" (Tuck & Yang, 2012, p. 7).

### Futurity

#### The aff's commitments to linear progress obscure Settler Colonialism's function on horizons of the future by reproducing the notion that "inequality" ie white racism can be modernized away.

**Tuck & Gaztambide-Fernandez** **13** -- (Eve Tuck is a professor at
University of New York & Ruben Gaztambide is a professor at University
of Toronto. "*Curriculum, Replacement, and Settler Futurity*, Journal of
Curriculum Theorizing", Volume 29, Number 1, 2013)

[The settler colonial curricular project of replacement is invested in
settler futurity]{.underline}, or what Andrew Baldwin calls the
["permanent virtuality" of the settler on stolen land]{.underline}
(2012, p. 173). **[When we locate the present of settler colonialism as
only the production of the past, we overlook how settler colonialism is
configured in relation to a different temporal horizon: the
future.]{.underline}** To say that something is invested in something
else's [futurity]{.underline} [is not the same as]{.underline} saying it
is invested in something's [future]{.underline}, though the replacement
project is invested in both settler future and futurity. [Futurity
refers to the ways in which, "the future is rendered
knowable]{.underline} [through specific practices]{.underline} (i.e.
calculation, imagination, and performance) [and]{.underline}, in turn,
[intervenes upon the present through three anticipatory
logics]{.underline} (i.e. [pre-caution, pre-emption and
preparedness]{.underline})" (p. 173). Considering the significance of
futurity for researching whiteness and geography, Baldwin (2012) wonders
whether **[a past-oriented approach reproduces the]{.underline}**
(**[false]{.underline}**), **[Teleological assumption that white racism
can be modernized away.]{.underline}** Such **[an assumption privileges
an ontology of linear causality in which the past is thought to act on
the present and the present is said to be an effect of whatever came
before]{.underline}** \[\...\] **[According to this kind of temporality,
the future is the terrain upon or through which white racism will get
resolved. It cleaves the future from the present and, thus, gives the
future discrete ontological form.]{.underline}** (p. 174) Thus, in this
historical analysis of the settler colonial curricular project of
replacement, we seek to emphasize the ways in which [replacement is
entirely concerned with settler futurity, which always indivisibly means
the continued and complete eradication of the original inhabitants of
contested land.]{.underline} **[Anything that seeks to recuperate and
not interrupt settler colonialism, to reform the settlement and
incorporate Indigenous peoples into the multicultural settler colonial
nation state is fettered to settler futurity.]{.underline}** To be
clear, our commitments are to what might be called an Indigenous
futurity, which does not foreclose the inhabitation of Indigenous land
by nonIndigenous peoples, but does foreclose settler colonialism and
settler epistemologies. That is to say that Indigenous futurity does not
require the erasure of now-settlers in the ways that settler futurity
requires of Indigenous peoples.

### Arms Sales

#### Restricting and regulating arms trade is an extension of post-colonial governance -- western states have always framed this regulation as a way to strategically further their interests and "civilize" colonial subjects

**Cooper** **'18** (Neil, PhD, Professor of International Relations and
Security Studies and Head of Peace Studies & International Development
at University of Bradford, Race, Sovereignty, and Free Trade: Arms Trade
Regulation and Humanitarian Arms Control in the Age of Empire, Journal
of Global Security Studies, 10.1093/jogss/ogy013)CN

However, **[focusing only on the]{.underline}** operation of
**[prohibitory regulatory norms]{.underline}** **[obscures the way arms
trade]{.underline}** **[regulation also constituted a specific colonial
form of arms control as governmentality, whereby mechanisms of
prohibition and prescription]{.underline}** **[were both put to the
service of governing which peoples could legitimately use what kinds of
arms]{.underline}**. Of course, efforts to manage arms flows to
potentially unruly colonial subjects by constantly seeking to balance
permission and proscription were neither completely effective nor ever
effectively complete. First, efforts at restraint were perennially
subject to strategies of evasion undertaken by local actors operating
with their own normative and cartographic understandings (Tagliacozzo
2005; Mathew 2016). Second, [arms trade regulation was a contested
terrain over which advocates of permission and advocates of restraint
often clashed]{.underline}. For example, [pressures for restraint were
offset by pressures to use the provision of arms to secure
access]{.underline} to [markets]{.underline} [and the
loyalty]{.underline} or security [of allies]{.underline} in a context of
intra-European competition **[to maintain and expand formal and informal
empires]{.underline}** (Grant 2007; Chew 2012). [Policy on the
ground]{.underline}, therefore, often [appeared
contradictory]{.underline}. **[Nevertheless]{.underline}**,
**[proponents of permission and proscription generally agreed on the
broad goals of policy---to maintain imperial influence and imperial
order]{.underline}**. As will be illustrated below, [they agreed even
more]{.underline} [on the broader logics in which arguments for
permission and proscription were to be located]{.underline}---**[those
governing sovereignty, free trade, development, and the standard of
civilization.]{.underline}** For example, the Brussels Act certainly
failed to prevent a substantial arms trade into Abyssinia and Somalia
where, by 1908, British officials considered the act had "completely
broken down"29 largely as a result of French support for a profitable
arms trade through French-controlled Djibouti. In this case, [colonial
norms of sovereignty provided the regulatory space for
proliferation]{.underline}. The legal legitimacy of this transit trade
was enshrined by Article Ten of the Brussels Act, which, somewhat
ironically, had been vigorously promoted by the British. [This affirmed
the right of]{.underline} inland [territories "under the sovereignty or
protectorate" of another signatory power to acquire arms via the
territory of a coastal power]{.underline}, and Italy had previously
announced Abyssinia's adhesion to the agreement. Compounding the irony,
at one point in the negotiations the French had suggested the conference
had "no power to impose a right of transit on any Sovereign state."30
Enforcement of both the arms and slave trade regulations of Brussels was
also hampered by French refusal to permit searches of sea vessels flying
the French flag. Arms smuggling dhow owners operating in both the Red
Sea and the Persian Gulf quickly realized the French flag represented "a
license to traffic" (Mathew 2016, 35), as it made each dhow an "island
of colonial sovereignty" (ibid., 34) and therefore immune to search.
This is not to imply sovereignty norms offered an unfettered license to
trade. **[The arms provisions of the Brussels Act were ultimately
predicated on the fact that European powers exercised "rights of
sovereignty]{.underline}**" (Article Nine) **[in their colonial
possessions.]{.underline}** Thus, **[the act and its implementation was
suffused with norms of sovereignty]{.underline}** **[that]{.underline}**
both **[underpinned restrictions on the arms trade and provided the
regulatory spaces permitting their circumvention]{.underline}**.
Similarly, [both the advocates for free trade in arms in the spaces of
empire and the advocates of restriction]{.underline} [crafted their
arguments by reference to]{.underline} the [shared ideational frames of
free trade, development, and the standard of
civilization---]{.underline}each heavily imbricated in the other. [In
Africa]{.underline}, for example, free trade advocates argued [the offer
of arms was essential for recruiting African laborers]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [that arms proliferation would speed the depopulation
of local wildlife, thus hastening the day when natives switched from
hunting and alcohol to legitimate trade]{.underline} (Storey 2008, 196).
Conversely, [proponents of restriction]{.underline} such as Alexander
Mackay (1890, 42) of the Church Missionary Society [deplored the fact
that "in the name of Christianity, free trade and civilization we
see]{.underline} firewater and [firearms pouring in every
port]{.underline} \[in Africa\]." However, for Mackay, [the solution lay
not only in "forbidding the import of arms]{.underline} and ammunition"
**[but in promoting legitimate trade amongst Africans,]{.underline}**
**["developing the resources of the country, and . . . promoting
internal peace]{.underline}**" so "**[the natives will . . . busy
themselves with growing whatever they can get a fair price for instead
of fighting]{.underline}**" (Letter to The Times, May 8, 1889). In this
sense, **[the Brussels Act represented the archetype of regulation in
the spaces of empire]{.underline}**, [**combining restrictions on the**
**arms**]{.underline} and liquor **[trades with calls for]{.underline}**
the **[development]{.underline}** of "agricultural labour and . . . the
industrial arts" amongst native populations (Article Two). At the same
time, the precise ways in which these twin processes of grafting and
counter-grafting played out varied from region to region and over time.
For example, in Singapore, policy from the 1820s onwards oscillated
between permission and proscription, as free trade and merchant pressure
on the one hand and concerns about the destabilizing impact of the
firearms trade on the other hand were weighed in different ways at
different times (Tagliacozzo 2005, 270; Chew 2012, 174--79). At Muscat,
commercial treaties between the sultan and various powers (particularly
the French) enshrining free trade severely hampered Britain's ability to
curtail the trade in the Persian Gulf. This was only finally resolved by
the aforementioned 1913 agreement between Britain and France. Thus, free
trade norms were constantly exposed to serial processes of grafting and
counter-grafting. Nevertheless, [as the nineteenth century merged into
the early twentieth century, arms trade regulation in the spaces of
empire was increasingly seen as consonant with a dominant imaginary of
liberal market norms]{.underline} (Mathew 2016). This is not to downplay
the pressures for imperial powers to supply arms to local allies, or the
way **[broader colonial conceptions of economic and geostrategic
interest militated against cooperation to limit the arms
traffic]{.underline}** as at Djibouti and Muscat.31 However, [such
factors]{.underline} ultimately [illustrate the way in which
particular]{.underline} assemblages of [norms]{.underline}, formal and
informal practices, responses to evasions, and norm-derived conceptions
of interest [constituted colonial practices of arms control as
governmentality.]{.underline} Understood **[in this way, oscillations in
policy in the same region or between different spheres of colonial
interest reflected the attempt]{.underline}** (always imperfect) **[to
manage arms flows according to where people were placed in the racially
inflected triple hierarchies of civilization, loyalty, and utility to
imperial power]{.underline}**---[hierarchies that could be either
mutually reinforcing or mutually opposed depending on
circumstance]{.underline}. **[Pressures to arm or disarm
locals]{.underline}** also **[illustrated how judgements about what
constituted]{.underline}** **[interest were predicated on a particular
moral economy in which European norms of racial superiority and
imperialism framed the standards of appropriate behavior of the
era]{.underline}** (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998, 892) **[and the fluid
but always subordinate identities of the other.]{.underline}**

#### The aff's attempt to control who can use what weapons in order to solve an impact exemplifies colonial governmentality -- it perpetuates the idea that we should regulate the Other in order to further our own interests

**Cooper** **'18** (Neil, PhD, Professor of International Relations and
Security Studies and Head of Peace Studies & International Development
at University of Bradford, Race, Sovereignty, and Free Trade: Arms Trade
Regulation and Humanitarian Arms Control in the Age of Empire, Journal
of Global Security Studies, 10.1093/jogss/ogy013)CN

However, [the Brussels Act represented]{.underline} just [one element in
a larger network of regulation aimed at restricting the supply of arms
to colonial subjects]{.underline} [in]{.underline} all the spaces of
[empire]{.underline}. This constituted the second Matryoshka doll of
arms trade governance. Thus, rather than being an era of free trade in
arms, [the period was]{.underline} actually [characterized by a dual
regime of regulation: the operation of a peacetime liberal export norm
for transfers from imperial metropoles **combined with widespread
efforts to manage arms flows into, within, and between the spaces of
empire**]{.underline} (using post-export blockades, import controls,
internal regulations, and restrictions on transfers between colonial
spaces). This contrasts with the contemporary emphasis on producer
export controls as a primary (if not exclusive) vehicle for managing the
global trade in conventional arms. [When located in this broader network
of prohibitory regulation,]{.underline} the [humanitarian
underpinnings]{.underline} of the Brussels Act [are revealed to be far
less significant]{.underline} **[than the concerns about the maintenance
of colonial]{.underline}** **[order]{.underline}** **[and qualitative
military advantage for imperial powers.]{.underline}** Of course, [**the
operation of a free trade in arms philosophy combined with competition
for colonies, markets, and influence amongst imperial powers
is**]{.underline} generally [**deemed to have trumped**]{.underline}
substantive **[efforts at limiting arms flows.]{.underline}** However,
**[practices of proscription and permission were both]{.underline}**
**[part of the attempt to delineate who could legitimately use which
gradations of weapons according to where they were located in the triple
hierarchies of civilization, loyalty, and utility to
empire]{.underline}**. This is not to deny that local actors constantly
engaged in strategies of evasion or that imperial policies were
perennially reversed or amended. Indeed, both permissive and
proscriptive arms trade norms were the site of recurring contestation
that played out in the form of competing appeals to transnational
constitutive norms such as sovereignty, free trade, colonialism, and the
standard of civilization. Nevertheless, the [oscillations in
policy]{.underline} this produced [are better understood less as a
failure]{.underline} of prohibition [and more as constituting the fluid
cartography of regulation]{.underline} [that]{.underline} was (and
[is]{.underline}) [a defining feature of arms control as
governmentality]{.underline}. Moreover, the process of **[serially
reinventing the border between legitimate and
illegitimate]{.underline}** **[ownership of,]{.underline}** **[and trade
in]{.underline}**, **[the means of violence represented an important
political project in its own right,]{.underline}** irrespective of the
actual material impact on arms flows. Indeed, [the understanding of arms
trade governance as a Sisyphean endeavor]{.underline} was (and
[remains]{.underline}) [central to the legitimizing politics of arms
control as governmentality]{.underline}; sanctifying the performative of
regulatory and institutional refinement, an á la carte approach to
normative frameworks (e.g. humanitarianism, free trade, military
necessity) [and their application to specific arms trade policy
questions]{.underline}. Nevertheless, [by the early 1900s colonial
powers had developed]{.underline} fairly [extensive mechanisms of
regulation that]{.underline}, in general, [were probably as effective as
the mechanisms of contemporary arms trade]{.underline} [regulation
heralded by optimists as signaling a shift to a novel form of **global
arms governance.**]{.underline}

#### Arms trades drive postcolonial militarism that reinforces hierarchies between the North/ South

World\", July 25, 2018, Review of International Studies,

The 1994 UNDP Human Development Report, which formalised the human
security agenda, was explicit [about the role of '**excessive
militarization and the international arms trade' as a 'critical source
of insecurity'**]{.underline}. 26 [Arising from '**the world's**
previous **preoccupation with deterrence and territorial security'**,
arms transfers, military assistance, proxy wars, excessive military
spending, politicised militaries in developing countries, and the
military-industrial complex, were all identified as impediments to the
realisation of human security]{.underline}.27 The report identified
concrete policy recommendations, including an international agreement to
phase out military assistance; a list of prohibited items for transfer;
a strengthened UN Register reporting system; the regulation and
elimination of subsidies; and a tax on arms sales to finance
peacekeeping.28 Such moves, alongside increased spending on
demilitarisation efforts, were envisaged as 'important step towards
achieving human security'. 29 While there was an emphasis on 'Third
World disarmament', the report was clear that this must be one component
of a 'blueprint for global disarmament'. 30 So [here **we have an agenda
for practical action on the weapons trade, challenging militarism to
improve human security**]{.underline}. The UNDP report identified the
nation-statist ideologies of deterrence and territorial security, as
well as the transnational practices of military assistance and proxy
wars, as key causes of insecurity. Simultaneously, it reopened the
debate about the link between security and development 'that had been
closed since the somewhat sterile polemic around the link between
disarmament and development' of the 1970s and 1980s.31 This earlier, now
ostensibly out-dated debate surmised that 'the North (that is, both
sides of the East--West conflict) should disarm, and devote the
resources freed up by arms reduction to development in the South'. 32 As
part of this shift in debate, [the move away from state-centred
definitions of security was accompanied by an acknowledgment of the
legitimate and crucial role of the state in providing security --
especially as security was emphasised as a precondition for development.
**So the anti-militarist call that identified the state as a creator of
insecurity was balanced against recognition of the legitimate role of
the state in providing security**]{.underline}. There was also a
downgrading of military threats as a particular type of threat to human
security: military threats do not appear as one of the seven main
categories articulated in the report (economic, food, health,
environmental, personal, community, political). Rather, threats from war
(defined as 'threats from other states') are listed under the category
of 'personal security', alongside threats of physical torture and ethnic
tension, as well as crime, rape, domestic violence, and suicide.33 The
analytical and political move made in the 1994 UNDP Report [was to
equate war with the state and move away from a concern with
territorially based definitions of security and inter-state war, which
it equates with militarism]{.underline}. There is a shift in focus to
the spectrum of armed violence and non-conflict violence, which are to
be remedied in the name of human security, in part through the
(re)construction of legitimate coercive apparatuses. [**The shift away
from militarism and towards human security claims to acknowledge the
changing character of conflict** and the role of the state in
monopolising legitimate violence, without privileging it
unthinkingly]{.underline}. Research in this vein has flourished in the
years since the 1994 report, and brings significant advantages to bear
over traditional state-centric analyses, such as the ability to account
for the geographical diversity of rates of armed violence within as well
as between states; sustained and distinct attention to gendered patterns
of violence, including the specific character of femicide as a distinct
form of violence; and the incorporation of questions of public health
and socioeconomic inequality into discussion about weapons transfers.34
For all these developments, the human security agenda's take on war,
conflict, and armed violence has not been without its critics[**. It has
been described as the 'new orthodoxy' that is 'unable to provide the
basis for a substantive change of the system of international security',
despite finding 'the old language of interstate war and conflict ...
lacking'**. 35 Similarly, **its initiatives such as 'eliminat\[ing\]
certain types of weapons' stands accused of failing to adequately
examine 'the pathologies inherent in the structure of the international
system' that generate such challenges**]{.underline}.36 And [**when the
'human' in human security is naturalised as masculine, the inclusion of
novel threats and new actors leaves the parameters of security
untouched**, meaning that 'state-based, militarised security remains
unchallenged']{.underline}. 37 Feminist scholars have critiqued the
gendered concepts and practices of war, peace, militarisation,
peacekeeping and soldiering, going well beyond the human security
framework in the process.[38 Feminist critiques that challenge the
parameters of human security can usefully be combined with
**postcolonial accounts of IR that emphasise the ways in which the
discipline 'can both deny empire while simultaneously normalizing an
imperial perspective on the world'**]{.underline}. 39 Some [of the
**main themes of the human security agenda are illustrative of the need
for an imperial perspective in how we understand the challenges facing
weapons control.**]{.underline} By this I mean interpreting them with
the aid [**of scholarship that challenges methodological nationalism and
Eurocentrism** in its analysis, mobilises feminist critiques of
militarism, **and puts the legacy of empire and colonialism**, and the
racial, gendered, and classed politics of imperial control, **front and
centre** in its assessment of contemporary challenges]{.underline}.**[40
Deploying]{.underline}** such **[resources gives us a chance to rethink
some of the key assumptions around human security and]{.underline}** the
prospects for **[regulating weapons circulation]{.underline}**. Three
core themes of the human security agenda are ripe for an imperial
critique. First, the claim that the character of conflict has changed,
from inter-state war towards internal conflict, has become axiomatic in
much of IR, including the human security literature.41 The greatest
threats to human security are deemed to stem from internal conflict and
criminal violence, or the state itself, rather than from an external
adversary as per the traditional security agenda. As such,
'international security traditionally defined -- territorial integrity
-- does not necessarily correlate with human security'. 42 Second, the
changing character of conflict requires a shift in the referent object
of security, according to the human security agenda: away from the state
and inter-state war, and towards the individual and the broader range of
threats they face. 43 And third, the human security agenda nonetheless
emphasises the importance of the state's monopoly on legitimate violence
and role in security provision.44 Yet the circumstances have been
transformed with the end of the Cold War. Kaldor attributes a 'profound
restructuring of political authority' to the new wars, and sees human
security as an opportunity for 'reconstructing political authority in
the context of the processes we call globalisation'. 45 Hence the need
for security sector reform (SSR), demobilisation, disarmament, and
reintegration (DDR) and other reforms of coercive practices and
apparatuses. Each of these three themes is premised on the significance
of the rupture that occurred with the end of the Cold War. But
[understanding the Cold War as predominantly an East--West ideological
and geopolitical confrontation marginalises longer historical patterns
of North--South power relations and conflict]{.underline}, and of hot
war in the South. And the [**increased focus on internal conflict, while
fruitful in terms of changing the scale of analysis, risks disconnecting
the micropolitics of violence from broader systems and structures of war
preparation**, **ignoring** one of the key lessons of feminist
scholarship, which is **that the scales or so-called levels of analysis
are interdependen**t.]{.underline} As Laura Sjoberg and Sandra Via put
it, 'absolutely distinguishing between the personal, national and
international level of war and militarism lacks conceptual and empirical
rigor at best': feminist attention allows us to understand both the
impact of war and militarism on people (especially, but not only, women)
as well as the gendered construction of war and militarism.46 [**A
longer historical view** that is not hamstrung by a state-centric
ontology **allows us to see that arms transfer practices have long been
part of the simultaneously transnational and asymmetrical constitution
of force**. **Historical scholarship on the arms trade emphasises the
importance of decolonisation as the shift from empire to a system of
formally sovereign states in which North-- South power asymmetries
continue to resonate**]{.underline}. One of the [**key transformations
in weapons transfer practices that** **came with decolonisation** was a
shift on the part of the Soviet Union and China from support for
national liberation movements, to the defence of sovereignty as a means
of resisting US-led domination, in either anti-capitalist or
anti-imperialist modes]{.underline}.47 The supply of weapons and
military training was a common feature of both Soviet and US relations
with the Third World: despite their differences, North--South
politico-military relations had much in common between the two blocs.48
Ostensibly new or transformed challenges of the post-Cold War era, such
as Somali piracy, new wars in Africa, or insurgency and
counterinsurgency in Afghanistan, are thus better understood in
postcolonial terms, with militarised transnational continuities as well
as changes associated with the end of superpower rivalry.49 Amina Mama
and Margo Okazawa-Rey emphasise the continuities between colonial and
contemporary militarism that not only led them to prefer the terminology
of postcolonial conflicts over that of new wars, but also emphasise the
fundamentally gendered characteristics of the physical and structural
violence at stake.50 And as Cooper argues[, **arms control regimes have
long featured both 'proscription and permission' operating in
tandem**]{.underline}, challenging the optimism of accounts premised on
the end of the Cold War as the changed permissive factor that allows
humanitarian concerns to be the core objective of weapons control. This
emphasis on history and power generates scepticism about the optimism
and presentism of most accounts of the emergence of the ATT, and the
linear, benevolent account of history found therein.52 A longer
historical perspective allows us to see how state security (whether
national or imperial) and (what is today called) human security have
long been two sides of the same coin. [**There are thus continuities of
imperial forms of practice despite the turn to formal
sovereignty**.]{.underline} A focus on the systematic or organised and
North--South character of much armed violence is not to return to Cold
War politics or the 'sterile polemic' of past debates about weapons
issues mentioned earlier. Rather, it is to [**emphasise that historical
weapons supply routes and power relations continue to resonate;** that
massive and uneven levels of global military spending and proxy wars
continue to matter; and that **clients continue to use weapons in ways
that are often unanticipated by patrons**]{.underline}. Ostensibly civil
or internal wars are enmeshed in wider regional and international
projects.53 **[There are internationalised sources of much of what
counts as domestic, civil or intra-state, including colonial legacies
and internationalised weapons supply chains]{.underline}**. In many
accounts, **[human security has been mobilised as an attempt to 'cope
with \[the\] pathological results' of how security has been defined in
postcolonial states in the South]{.underline}**.54 Yet this encourages
internalist analysis that sees the problems of armed violence as having
their sources primarily within the global South. In [**conceding the
terms of debate to 'traditional' security studies, and seeking to shift
inwards from the state to the individuals living within it**, rather
than critiquing the conception of the international system, **the human
security agenda continues to 'occlude and distort imperial relations'
in** the way that **more traditional 'Westphalian terms of reference'**
do.]{.underline}55 In the human security agenda's account of the shift
from wars between states to wars within them, war falls off the agenda
as it is deemed analytically outdated and politically regressive. Yet
neo-realist, Cold War accounts of national security were never adequate,
and in trying to overcome them, many human security accounts take them
at face value and get the critique wrong. With its emphasis on the
enduring power of war preparation, the concept of militarism suggests
[**that much contemporary violence remains coordinated or facilitate**d
(by state, paramilitary, militia, or other organised actors), **and
systematic within society**]{.underline}, despite the shift towards
discussion of armed violence and intentional homicide, which is
suggestive of disorganised violence.

#### The affirmative reifies state sovereignty projects through arms sales restrictions -- justifies military industrial complex of violence and interventions

This doctrine of [state sovereignty gives rise to]{.underline} yet
another kind of [separation]{.underline}: the relative autonomy [of the
state]{.underline} (or executive) [from both the people and]{.underline}
the [constitution]{.underline}. It is integral to modern
constitutionalism. [A]{.underline} modern [constitution]{.underline},
Kant famously argued, does not arise from the spontaneous interaction of
the pre-civil people. Rather, it [requires some kind of
master]{.underline} or legislator [to impose law on the crooked timber
of the people and to act, without their consent]{.underline} and
independent of law in exceptional circumstances [until they are
\"civilized\" by]{.underline} centuries of [subjection]{.underline} to
civil law. As Machiavelli and Chomsky add, these [constitutive powers
are supplemented with the powers of \"manufacturing the
consent\"]{.underline} of the people and making non-constitutional
actions appear constitutional in order to gain legitimacy. Far from
disappearing, some contemporary theorists argue, like Hobbes, that
sovereignty in this sense structures the constitutional form and the
form that constituent powers take within it. That is, [the field of
\"constitutional form and constituent power\"]{.underline} is really [a
game between the constitutive sovereign and the constituent people
within and over the constitutional form]{.underline} (the contract
between them)-a game [that]{.underline}, according to the realists, [the
sovereign dominates]{.underline}. As with constitutional forms and
constituent powers (features one and two), there are two corresponding
classes of constitutive sovereignty: state sovereignty in its various
forms and the candidates for sovereignty over the various global
constitutional forms listed above. **[The global sovereigns range ,from
the competing imperial powers in the colonial age to the informal
sovereigns today, such as a single superpower]{.underline}** (the United
States since 1989), the G8 or G20, **[a coalition or balance of
civilized, advanced or democratic states]{.underline}**, the Bretton
Woods institutions and the WTO, the transnational corporations empowered
by trade agreements under the WTO, an empowered UN, or some combination
of these contenders. Fourth, I have been writing as if constituent
powers (feature two) consist only of political powers, that is, powers
of self-government that are said to be delegated or alienated to
representative institutions and also exercised directly in public
spheres. But this is too narrow. As Locke, Marx, and Weber insisted, the
**[constituent powers of the people that are institutionalized by a
modern constitutional system of laws consist of three distinct types of
powers]{.underline}**: political power or the powers of
[self-government]{.underline} (feature two); [labour]{.underline} or
productive powers; [and the]{.underline} powers to protect oneself and
others, or [military and police power]{.underline}. Modern constitutions
differentially distribute these three types of constituent powers into
three distinct sets of legal institutions of modern societies:
political, economic, and police and military.19 The second type of
constituent power, labour power, is exercised by selling it for a wage
on the market to competing national or multinational corporations that
manage its exercise and extract a profit. These capitalist forms of
constituent labour power and private property in the means of production
and contractual relations are stipulated by the constitutional forms of
state and international legal regimes and enforced by the corresponding
sovereigns. This form of organization of productive power is distinctive
to modern constitutionalism. Humans have been dispossessed of their
access to the land and independent means of production: first, with the
enclosures within Europe and then, with the dispossession of the
non-European peoples of their indigenous legal and political control
over their resources and labour during the spread of western imperialism
and\'its legal orders, as Marx and Hobson concurred.2 \" Just as one can
think of political powers being either delegated or alienated to the
representative institutions, so too can one think of economic powers
being either delegated or alienated to the capitalist corporations, as
Weber neatly demonstrated. Productive powers are also conceptualized in
the same abstract way as political powers: that is, as capacities
capable of being shaped and exercised in a multiplicity of forms-within
the corporatized division of labour.2 The third type of constituent
power, [the powers of self-and-other defense, is alienated to the police
and the military-industrial complex in modern constitutional
formation]{.underline}s. Although rebellions were fought in the name of
no standing armies in the seventeenth century, [by the early nineteenth
century every **modern state had a** constitutionally protected
**permanent military complex**]{.underline}.22 [These complexes are
standardly connected to the most advanced research and
development]{.underline} institutions, the [largest commercial
firms]{.underline}, a secure tax base, a [permanent supply of
recruits]{.underline} through the levde en masse, the draft, and, more
recently, the state\'s purchase of private armies on the market, a
separate class of influential military-political leaders, [naval and
army bases throughout the old European empires, and the paramount global
military system of the United States]{.underline} that claims to
exercise full spectrum dominance of the planet today. As Montesquieu
foresaw in 1748, this peculiar formation of protective powers is caught
in an ever-escalating arms race with other constitutional states. And,
**[since decolonization]{.underline}** in the twentieth century, **[it
has developed into an expanding arms-sales industry to dependent and
indebted former colonies and proxy states]{.underline}**. As Locke
warned in 1675, [the resulting power imbalance between the
permanently-armed sovereign state and the legally disarmed people
undermines the rough equality between the people and their
representatives]{.underline} that was the guarantee of a free and
constitutionally bound polity, thereby **[opening the people to abuse by
their own government and to unlimited military adventures
abroad]{.underline}**, without an effective counter-balance. Yet,
because [the people always desire to be free of oppression, the system
is a recipe for inevitable wars and revolts.]{.underline}23 Just as
constituent political powers are organized in different governance
institutions within constitutional states and suprastate organizations
(second feature), so too are economic and military constituent powers.
The Bretton Woods institutions, the G8, and the most powerful
transnational corporations govern economic power through the suprastate
systems of trade and finance law.2 \" [The United States now claims to
exercise full spectrum military dominance over the world\'s forms of
constituent military power to protect. democracy and free trade,
multilaterally and in accord with international law]{.underline} and the
Security Council if possible (juridical dominance), [but **unilaterally
and without the law if necessary**]{.underline} (executive dominance).

### Small Arms

#### Discourses of small arms control reproduces hierarchies between the global North and South 

**Straviankas 11** Anna Straviankas, "Small Arms Control and the
Reproduction of Imperial Relations", *Contemporary Security Policy,
32:1, 193-214*, 2011, DOI: 10.1080/13523260.2011.556861, /MegLak

The analysis thus far suggests that weaknesses in the conceptualization
of small arms control are more fundamental than many
scholar-practitioners imagine. The emerging dominant paradigm is an
improvement on conventional security studies in a number of ways. It
moves beyond great power politics, has a broader set of concerns beyond
state security that include human security, focusses on the majority
world and their security concerns, and attempts to take local
subjectivities seriously. Despite this, [small arms control is marked by
the application of categories derived from an idealized account of
Northern historical development]{.underline}. [It]{.underline} thus
[remains Eurocentric in that it 'derives its core categories and
assumptions about world politics from a particular understanding of
European experience']{.underline}.120 Not only has conceptual work
stalled, but **[a Eurocentric conceptualization of organized violence
and its control means that programmes will continue to
fail]{.underline}**. Beyond this, [small arms control is also marked by
a series of exclusions, which point to the lack of a common frame for
understanding armed violence]{.underline}. This [**serves to produce the
South as a site of intervention**, contributing to the mutual
constitution of both North and South]{.underline}. Furthermore, the
internationalizing policy community that has emerged in relation to
small arms control is itself marked by North-South hierarchies. Overall,
then, small arms control is better understood as a moment in the
reproduction of imperial relations. There are two main exclusions or
silences in play in small arms control: a geo- graphical and a
technological one, both of which speak to wider questions of the social
relations of militarism and the world military order. [Small arms
control efforts are heavily geographically circumscribed.]{.underline}
In addition to the almost total exclusion of Northern societies from the
international public policy agenda, [control efforts are most prominent
in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Balkans, while the Middle
East, and South and East Asia receive far less attention]{.underline}.
The Small Arms Survey's three 'focus projects', for example, are its
Sudan Human Secur- ity Baseline Assessment, Timor-Leste Armed Violence
Assessment, and the Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and
Development. The latter 'strives to achieve measurable reductions in the
global burden of armed violence by 2015' and its focus countries are
Burundi, Guatemala, Jamaica, Kenya, Papua New Guinea, and
Timor-Leste.121 [The Control Arms campaign for a legally binding Arms
Trade Treaty]{.underline} (spearheaded by Amnesty International, Oxfam,
and the International Action Network on Small Arms), meanwhile,
[focusses on protecting human rights and development concerns in arms
transfer decisions]{.underline}. In practice, [this results in a focus
on transfers to the South, but to the exclusion of oil-rich Middle
Eastern states that are not, by definition, poor.]{.underline}122 [This
is emblematic of]{.underline} a much [wider]{.underline} exclusion,
namely of the world military order and [questions of
militarism]{.underline}. [**The small arms debate perpetuates a partial
argument that reproduces the dominant conflict -- security --
development nexus**]{.underline} that has become central to post-Cold
War international security, severs small arms from the wider arms
dynamic and world military order, and [hives off violent conflict in the
South from the wider spectrum of war and organized
violence.]{.underline} The irony of this is that the post-Cold War human
security and conflict -- security -- development approaches, and [the
focus on small arms, were themselves a response to a previous silence
created by the state-centrism and obsession with major conventional
weaponry]{.underline} and nuclear weapons of Cold War arms control
discourse. But in filling that gap, they perpetuate their own silences.
[The world military order]{.underline}, in which the struc- ture and
dynamics of military activity are understood as a site of interaction in
their own right, albeit one shaped by and shaping the wider social
structures of which they are a part,123 [includes intra-Northern
production and trade and North--South trans- fers, as well as
South--South transfers and small arms proliferation]{.underline},
[practices that are gendered, racialized and class-based in a variety of
ways]{.underline}. [These]{.underline} all have different dynamics and
social relations, and **[facilitate different forms of violence, but
need to be studied together in a single frame]{.underline}**. Martin
Shaw argues that while 'It seems difficult to conceptualise Western and
non-Western warfare together in a single frame . . .there is an
overriding case for doing so.'124 Although scholars of armed violence
may object that the concept of warfare is no longer adequate for
understanding, for example, the blurred boundary between conflict and
crime, an approach based on a framework of militarism, defined as 'the
penetration of social relations in general by military relations',125
allows for analysis of different modes of violence in differ- ent
locales at different times, all the while united by a single analytical
frame. [The current absence of a single frame is another feature of
Eurocentrism]{.underline}.126 As Kalyvas argues in relation to
understanding violence, the challenge is to understand both the
uniqueness and specificity of forms and instances of violence, and also
the deep and regular structural features of it.127 [Sophisticated
analytical]{.underline} frameworks that have emerged in the last five
years or so seek [to address the 'problem of classifying different forms
of violence']{.underline} and 'erase or blur the analytic distinctions
between different forms of violence in order to bring violence -- in all
its social and political forms -- back into the new thinking on
security', as Krause argues.128 But while this sort of approach
discusses the 'micro' and 'macro' levels, it [sidelines the
international and historical context. While the sociology of armed
violen]{.underline}ce -- including factors such as social and economic
exclusion, urbanization, and marginalization129 -- [is becoming central
to small arms control, the international relations of armed violence
remain conspicuous by their absence]{.underline}. [There are
no]{.underline} international [structural]{.underline} or histori- cal
[forces evident in the debate around small arms proliferation or its
control, which are in turn not analyzed in conjunction with wider
patterns of]{.underline} military production and trade, or [the
deployment of violence]{.underline}. Overall, for all its sensitivity,
[the problem of small arms and armed violence is ultimately deemed to be
internal to Southern states and regions]{.underline}. While the small
arms scholar-practitioner community is paying attention to the world's
majority population, remedying a key deficit of traditional security
studies, [the South appears as a site of good intentions, as 'bearers of
rights and objects of emancipation, that is, for their normative value
in Western political theoretic terms']{.underline}.130 [In]{.underline}
parts of [the South, **the twin effects of small arms control are
top-down attempts to create Weberian nation-states with a monopoly on
legitimate violence, combined with bottom-up disarmament, and promotion
of liberal forms of social relations.**]{.underline}131 The element of
social transformation is now an explicit part of small arms control and
the wider DDR and SSR practices in which it is embedded. As Pouligny
argues, the fundamental goal of DDR 'is more than just about putting
weapons beyond use, but is rather about changing attitudes'.132 There is
a fundamental complementarity between these two sets of practices. [A
legitimate state monopoly on violence and the rule of law are seen as a
prerequisite for security and development by both conservative and
liberal proponents, with the latter interested in social transformation
as well.]{.underline} It is not only the South that is reproduced
through small arms control. [In the North, **a benevolent identity is
produced and ongoing military superiority perpetuated through small arms
measures**]{.underline}. Through their support for an international Arms
Trade Treaty, for example, [the UK and French governments --
consistently two of the world's top arms-exporting states -- represent
themselves as intervening on behalf of those millions of people who live
in daily fear of armed violence.]{.underline} Then-British and French
Foreign Ministers, David Miliband and Bernard Kouchner, called the
uncontrolled often illegal spread of weapons 'One of the great tragedies
of our time', arguing that 'there is an urgent moral imperative to grip
a global problem that is spinning out of control'. Their respective
governments have played a leading role in efforts at an Arms Trade
Treaty which could be a 'crucial step'.133 [**This representation**
of]{.underline} regulatory gaps, a lack of consistency, and the [illegal
trade as the problem]{.underline}, which the European world will
manfully step up to try to address, **[obscures the role of the legal,
state-sanctioned trade, and the uneven development of capitalist
globalization that creates the conditions for the violence conducted
with a variety of categories of arms]{.underline}**.
[Focussing]{.underline} a little [closer on the UK]{.underline}, its
arms control practice features a combi- nation of concerted action on
small arms in tandem with NGOs,134 a focus on con- trolling pariah
weapons,135 and ongoing exports that contravene the spirit, if not the
letter of UK obligations.136 While [NGOs]{.underline}, including major
ones such as Oxfam, [work in partnership with the UK government,
naturalizing and popularizing particu- lar understandings of the arms
trade]{.underline}, the UK Defence Manufacturers' Association, a key
industry lobby group, has come out in favour of the Arms Trade Treaty as
a means to 'crack down on illegal traders and proliferators, and also as
an instrument to create a more equitable regulatory environment for
defence exports worldwide'.137 The association believes that any treaty
'would not bring new obligations for UK Industry'.138 Any eventual
treaty would thus have no impact on UK domestic pro- curement or
military posture, while inevitably restricting that of Southern states,
whose import practices would be subjected to scrutiny and regulation.
This [allows the UK to remain a major military producer, perpetuating
asymmetry in the world military order, while simultaneously disciplining
the Southern constitution of armed force and seeming
benevolent]{.underline} in its concern for human rights and development.
Finally, [it is also worth noting the North--South relations that are
reproduced in terms of the agents of small arms control.]{.underline}
[The small arms network began life at the end of the Cold
War]{.underline} as a group of Northern (in particular British and
American), security-oriented NGOs and academics focussed on arms export
controls. [Since then, a shared agenda has emerged between states, and
between state and non-state actors]{.underline} such as NGOs, research
centres, and academics. [Key states involved in the small arms debate
and funding NGOs]{.underline} include Australia, Germany, Norway,
Netherlands, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. Key NGOs include Amnesty
Inter- national, the International Action Network on Small Arms (IANSA),
International Alert, Oxfam, Saferworld (all headquartered in the UK),
Human Rights Watch (New York), and the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue
(Geneva). Research centres such as the Geneva-based Small Arms Survey,
the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the
Federation of American Scientists, headquar- tered in Washington, DC,
the Bonn International Center for Conversion (BICC) and the Oslo-based
International Peace Research Institute (PRIO), have been central to the
production of knowledge about small arms. The early movement on small
arms was kick-started by a \$224,000 multi-year grant from 1994 from the
Ford Foundation to 'help build infrastructure for international
promotion of the SALW issue'.[139 It is important to note that the
conflict -- security -- development nexus is heavily emphasized by some
Southern governments and NGOs]{.underline}, in particular those in
sub-Saharan Africa, and that some Southern NGOs such as Viva Rio
(Brazil) and Gun Free South Africa, have been key Southern influences on
the small arms debate. [There is]{.underline} [thus a significant degree
of co-production of small arms control by actors across the
commonly-held divides of International Relations between public and
private]{.underline}, and (less so) North and South. Aid agencies,
non-governmental organiz- ations and research centres from North and
South are involved in the promulgation of small arms control efforts.
But within this internationalizing formation, research, funding and
policy initiatives tend to come from the North, and the vast majority of
interventions take place in the South. Overall, [the institutional basis
of small arms control is marked by a distinctly North--South relation
which]{.underline}, although actors do their best to mitigate its worst
effects, **[remains notably hierarchical]{.underline}**.140

### Disarm

#### Disarmament discourses are predicated on the view of the West as a virtuous nation, needing to restrict nuclear weapons as a move to civilize the demonized East

**Mathur 18** Ritu Mathur, "Techno-Racial Dynamics of Denial and
Difference in Weapons Control", *Asian Journal of Political Science*,
2018, <https://doi.org/10.1080/02185377.2018.1515640>, /MegLak

In reimagining the West and articulating the problem of difference or
heterology in international relations, [scholars contend that
'difference is marked and contained as international difference' with
the emergence of territorially bounded modern sovereign states that
'defines the problem of difference principally as between and among
states]{.underline}' (Naeem & David, 2004). It is claimed that the
[insistence on the maintenance of order in the international system
generates a 'pervasive suspicion of difference' as a source of disorder,
degeneration and armed conflict]{.underline}. The 'problem of difference
emerges and intensifies under modern conditions of relative equality,
often leading to the reassertion of (illicit or informal) forms of
social hierarchy' and the marking of others as inferior, dependent and
threatening (Naeem & David, 2004, p. 23). [The doubt and anxiety
generated with the discovery of difference is to be contained
by]{.underline} locating it 'at some distance from the self' and
[insisting on structural uniformity]{.underline}. [These managerial
exercises compound the problem]{.underline} of difference
[by]{.underline} their [failure to account for the injuries suffered as
a result of a violent]{.underline} and exploitative [colonial practices
of imperialism]{.underline}. Barkawi and Stanski (2012) further suggest
that war among states is 'a difference of opinion pursued through
violent means' (Barkawi & Stanski, 2012, pp. 2--3) It is the act of
splitting of inside/outside that 'deflect (s) our responses to
difference in the direction of 'putrefying hatred' and constitutes the
'political and ethical limits and possibilities of modern life' (Naeem &
David, 2004, pp. 44--45). [These conditions of sovereign political
community foster 'ethically limited and tragic interactions of these
separate states']{.underline} (Naeem & David, 2004, pp. 44--45). The
tragic [interactions during war entail 'recognition as well as Othering'
through war propaganda]{.underline} (Porter, 2013). But such propaganda
exercises are often undertaken as preliminary measures prior to the
catalytic event that leads to the outbreak of actual war. This [othering
takes place through deployment of techno-racial
stereotyping]{.underline}. It is differences in technology and race that
are emphasized to produce stereotypes. John W. Dower (1986) argues that
'[portraits of the enemy' are sketched through 'gross simplification and
reductionism' generating two forms of stereotyping]{.underline} (Dower,
1986, p. 30). The 'first kind of stereotyping could be [summed up in the
statement: You are the opposite of what you say you are and the opposite
of us, not peaceful but warlike]{.underline}, not good but bad ... In
the second form of stereotyping, the formula ran like this: [you are
what you say you are, but that itself is reprehensible']{.underline}
(Dower, 1986, p. 30). [Postcolonial scholarship has probed at length
into these cultural encounters to expose the psychology that accompanies
techno-racial stereotypes of Orientalism and Occidentalism]{.underline}.
A 'dehumanizing picture of the West' is painted through the prejudiced
practices of Occidentalism (Buruma & Margalit, 2004). Practices of
Occidentalism regard the West with 'loathing' as a '"machine
civilization", coldly rationalist, mechanical, without a soul' (Buruma &
Margalit, 2004, pp. 31, 21, 19). [Occidentalism is often 'seen as the
expression of bitter resentment toward an offensive display of
superiority by the West']{.underline} (Buruma & Margalit, 2004, p. 91).
[Yet there is also a desire for 'Western knowledge for practical
matters, such as weaponry']{.underline} (Buruma & Margalit, 2004, p.
39). An [occidentalist exhibits awareness that it is only through
practices of 'development and modernization' that it is possible to make
any allowance for any possibility of regeneration and redemption of the
Other]{.underline} (Naeem & David, 2004, p. 49). But 'the problem of
radical modernizers is how to modernize without becoming a mere clone of
the West' (Buruma & Margalit, 2004, p. 39). This resistance to becoming
a clone of the West is because 'the mind of the West in the eyes of the
Occidentalists is a truncated mind, good for finding the best way to
achieve a given goal, but utterly useless in finding the right way'
(Buruma& Margalit, 2004, p. 76). Buruma and Margalit assert that, 'the
mind of the West is often portrayed by Occidentalists' as a: mind
without a soul, efficient, like a calculator, but hopeless at doing what
is humanly important. The mind of the West is capable of great economic
success, to be sure, and of developing and promoting advanced
technology, but cannot grasp the higher things in life, for it lacks
spirituality and understanding of human suffering (Buruma& Margalit,
2004, p. 75).There is also an acute awareness that 'the overt language
of race ... superseded by the new development of hierarchy of modernity'
does not conceal a 'link' that 'could be inferred by the more privileged
observer standing in the transatlantic world' (Jones, 2010). In an
effort to generate critical self- reflexivity on practices of
Orientalism and Occidentalism [there has been a proliferation of
discourses on 'strategic Orientalism', 'techno Orientalism' and
'military Orientalism']{.underline} as discussed below. Keith Krause and
Andrew Latham (1998) argue that [practices of 'strategic orientalism'
constitute the 'foundation of Western security culture']{.underline}
(Krause & Latham, 1998, p. 41). They assert that strategic orientalism
[is premised on the 'pervasive and axiomatic belief that the
West]{.underline} (or occasionally the United States) as a civilization
[has a special role to play in global security affairs'']{.underline}
(Krause & Latham, 1998, pp. 41, 37). This is based on '[a reading of the
politico-strategic objectives and purposes of Third World states that is
informed more by Western fears and prejudices than by the realities of
politics in these states']{.underline} (Krause & Latham, 1998, p. 38).
The deep-rooted fear of the attacking Asian hordes and their ability to
industrialize and develop sophisticated weapons reinforces twenty-first
century concerns about the 'Rising East'. [This 'phenomenon of imagining
Asia and Asians in hypo-or hypertechnological terms in cultural
productions and political discourse' is understood as
'techno-Orientalism']{.underline} (Roh et al., 2015, p. 2). Practices of
techno-Orientalism [driven by 'imperial aspirations' and 'appetites of
consumerist societies' are 'infused with the languages and codes of the
technological and futuristic' and in 'digital spaces abound with
reinscribed racial tropes and stereotypes]{.underline}; these are sites
in which racialization is more likely reinforced than challenged' (Roh
et al., 2015, p. 14). Scholars developing the concept of
techno-Orientalism observe its 'growing prevalence in the Western
cultural consciousness' and suggest that the '[US techno Orientalist
imagination has its roots in the view of Asian body ... as a form of
expendable technology]{.underline}' (Roh et al., 2015, pp. 7--11).
Nevertheless they insist that the scope of techno-Orientalism is
'expansive and bi-directional' and ponder on the 'danger that Asian and
Asian American creators ... might internalize techno Orientalist
patterns and uncritically replicate the same dehumanizing model' (Roh et
al., 2015, pp. 3, 7). But unlike strategic Orientalism and
techno-Orientalism, Military Orientalism is described as an exercise
undertaken to investigate the mental baggage of Western consciousness
accumulated from an interest in 'non-Western warfare' (Porter, 2013, pp.
16--17). [The endeavor of military Orientalism is to unpack the 'range
of assumptions and myths through which Westerners gaze on the military
East and engage in a critical dialogue with our own
preconceptions']{.underline} (Porter, 2013, pp. 16--17). It encourages
Westerners to voice their own 'fears about themselves, their survival,
identity and values, through different visions of non-Western warfare'
(Porter, 2013, p. 21). [Military Orientalism issues a warning against
reducing military history to a morality play]{.underline} (Porter, 2013,
p. 75). But [it is open to the idea that our common experiences of
suffering can help cultivate a 'source of critical self-reflection to
perhaps nurture some understanding of the 'intimacy of the
relationship']{.underline} (Naeem & David, 2004, p. 187; Nandy, 1983).
[In investigating the intimacy of a relationship it might be possible to
glean and 'retrieve recessive images and practices' that have been
historically constituted through a network of social relations and
processes]{.underline} (Naeem & David, 2004, p. 191). These might
present creative opportunities to move beyond 'policing boundaries of
self as an exclusive and homogenous space' and instead 'appreciate and
claim the self that exists as part of the other beyond those boundaries'
(Naeem & David, 2004, p. 204). Porter insists on 'the interactive and
power-political nature of war, which has a culture of its own that can
change all parties to a conflict' (2013, p. 55). [Porter claims that,
'paradoxically, war can drive cultures closer together]{.underline}'
(2013, p. 33). This is [because, 'war ... is not simply a clash of
Others, made possible by an ignorant horror of difference. The warrior
looks out at the enemy and sees men who are, in crucial respects,
recognizably like himself']{.underline} (Porter, 2013, p. 34). He also
argues that an engagement with, 'the foreign "Other" can be treated as a
superior model to inform self-examination' (2013, p. 108). But [this
hopeful promise]{.underline} of Military Orientalism [has not stemmed
the tide of populist discourses deploying the dynamic of difference
between 'The West and the Rest' in the aftermath of the Cold War to wage
and perpetuate a global War on Terror]{.underline}. On the contrary it
is possible to argue that [there is deliberate and contingent deployment
of a 'decivilizing rhetoric that blends irrational, aggressive, rigid,
paranoid and exceptionalist discourses to demonize
Other-ness']{.underline} and give 'unwarranted authority and autonomy'
to 'militarist and imperialist discourses of national security' (Taylor,
2007, p. 670). There is '[sustained use of decivilizing imagery' that
'represents the United States as a virtuous nation reluctantly but
legitimately fulfilling its divine mandate to use civilized reason and
superior force' vis-a vis 'nuclear capable]{.underline} [and aspiring
nations in Asia]{.underline}, Africa and the Middle [East' depicted in a
'racist, sexist language that reproduces colonial ideology]{.underline}.
As such it rejects the authority and legitimacy of these nations as
potential possessors of nuclear weapons and solidifies continued
dominance by the United States of the nuclear strategic environment'
(Taylor, 2007, p. 685). The strength of these populist discourses
reinforcing a dynamic of difference and denial is exhibited with the
contemporary 'malpractice' of the Trump administration to not respect
the nuclear deal negotiated with Iran (Kimball, 2018). [Nuclear weapons
have]{.underline} long [been regarded as]{.underline} 'a new
technological deity' and ['a divinely offered gift that endorsed
American exceptionalism and imbued its creators with God-like power and
the mission to restore order and justice in a fallen
world.']{.underline} (Taylor, 2007, p. 677). Gabrielle Hecht (2012)
defines nuclear exceptionalism as 'insistence on an essential nuclear
difference -- manifested in political claims, technological systems,
cultural forms, institutional infrastructures, and scientific knowledge'
and insists '[nuclear exceptionalism could be made, unmade, and remade'
as 'for all efforts at making nuclear things exceptional, there were
opposing attempts to render them banal']{.underline} (Hecht, pp. 6-- 8).
It is important to bear this in mind as this pernicious dynamic of
difference and exceptionalism becomes even more acute with current US
President Donald Trump's everyday populist declarations. He is on record
for stating that the US will be at the 'top of the pack' 'until such
time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes' (Holland, 2017).
In his recent visit to Poland 'to summon the courage and the will to
defend our civilization' Trump (2017) claims 'there are dire threats to
our security and our way of life' and argues, 'the fundamental question
of our time is whether the West has the will to survive.' There is
little doubt in his mind of the 'triumph' of the West (Holland, 2017).

#### The aff's project of disarmament is a form of "sly civility" that places control of disarmament narratives in the hands of the West, allowing for an assumption that Western practices of arms control exist for a "public good"

**Mathur 15** Ritu Mathur, "Sly civility and the paradox of equality/
inequality in the nuclear order: a post-colonial critique", *Critical
Studies on Security*, 2015, DOI: 10.1080/21624887.2015.1106428, /MegLak

**[Sly civility can be understood as a concept encompassing practices of
racial etiquette and strategic orientalism]{.underline}** as discussed
below. The [**practices of racial etiquette** came into play with such
speed in the establishment of the nuclear order that 'the previous
longevity of anti-egalitarian and racist sentiment can and was easily
lost sight]{.underline}' (Furedi 1998, 15). [The practices]{.underline}
of racial etiquette are conscious of the formal principles of equality
among sovereign states, [**induce an epistemological silence against any
overt statements on racial inequality but stubbornly refuse to give up
on the idea of political mastery**.]{.underline} Frank Furedi argues
that practices of [racial etiquette **represent a 'second form of
colonization' that** does not have any serious commitment to anti-racism
but **seeks to indulge in a 'silent war' to 'produce**]{.underline} over
time, social formations and even [world orders that were]{.underline}
macrostructural [systems of inclusion and exclusion']{.underline} (5).
These practices of [**racial etiquette are further reinforced by**
contemporary practices of **strategic orientalism**]{.underline}. Edward
Said articulated the concept of '[Orientalism' to demonstrate how the
West constitutes its own identity on the premise of its differences with
others]{.underline} often seen as a source of threat (Said 2001). In
[these iterative practices of representation the cultural differences
are effectively deployed to differentiate the West and discipline the
others in the international order]{.underline}. Keith Krause and Andrew
Latham suggest that the continued exercise of this disciplinary power
necessitates maintenance of military superiority in the post-Cold War
period. **[The West]{.underline}** then **[deploys 'strategic
orientalism' as a 'new conceptual template' that enables the West to
impute 'politicostrategic objectives]{.underline}** and purposes' **[to
Third World countries in a manner that is 'informed more by Western
fears and prejudices than by the realities of politics in these
states']{.underline}** (Krause and Latham 1998, 38). It transforms
'essentially contestable interpretations of danger' into '"objective"
and incontestable facts regarding the sources of threat and insecurity
in the international system' (38). [An effort to map these intersecting
practices]{.underline} of racial etiquette, orientalism and strategic
orientalism on a continuum [reveals practices of sly
civility]{.underline}. [A grasp of these practices]{.underline} of sly
civility [facilitates an understanding of the nuclear order with its
practices of inclusion and exclusion and the **West's efforts to control
the narrative of**]{.underline} nuclear arms control and
**[disarmament]{.underline}**. In this narrative [there is **an
assumption that the Western practices of arms control and
disarmament**]{.underline} are 'rational', 'benign' and [provide for the
global '**public good'**]{.underline} (Krause and Latham 1998, 23). The
[control of the narrative and its representation of these standards is a
prerequisite in the exercise of power over others]{.underline}. Any
resistance to this narrative is through practices of racial etiquette
and strategic orientalism to be marginalized as peripheral and a source
of instability and chaos. These [practices of strategic orientalism or
sly civility are not sensitive to the 'ethnocentricity' of their
underlying assumptions]{.underline} and exhibit a 'distinct matrix of
beliefs and dispositions' towards others in the field of arms control
and disarmament (23).It is, therefore, imperative that practices of sly
civility be 'caught in the irredeemable act of writing' (Bhabha 1994,
133). Homi K. Bhabha suggests that the 'practice of writing' is a
'strategy of colonialist regulation' (134). This writing 'puts on trial
the very discourse of civility within which representative government
claims its liberty and empire its ethics' (136). The writing makes
visible the 'nationalist, authoritarian tone' that polices the
'culturally and racially differentiated colonial space' of arms control
and disarmament (134). This authoritarian tone is embedded in a
narrative that is narcisstic in its insistence that the other recognize
its authority. In its insistence for this recognition it is willing to
calculate and deploy tactical measures such as 'skeptical conceits' that
dismiss any efforts of the others that seek to challenge its authority
(141). Any resistance unleashes acute anxiety and a 'paranoia of power'
that generates 'political and psychic' contestations on authority to
regulate the borders of arms control and disarmament (141--2). Despite
this anxiety, [it is important to scrutinize arms control and
disarmament texts as 'despatches of hyprocrisy' that seek to 'moralize'
but exhibit a specific 'discursive doubleness']{.underline} that exists
between the lines as an 'effect of the ambivalent, deferred address of
colonialist governance' (Bhabha 1994, 136). It is [in this space
'between the civil address and its colonial signification' with 'each
axis displaying a problem of recognition and repetition' that there
'shuttles the signifier of authority in search of a strategy of
surveillance, subjection, and inscription']{.underline} (136). The
signifier of authority traverses through time and through its repetition
deepens the crisis of authority experienced in practices of arms control
and disarmament. **[This crisis of authority encourages 'projections'
compelling the 'native to address the master' and reproducing the native
as 'partially aligned or reformed' in discourse 'endangering the
boundaries of truth itself']{.underline}** (142).

### Prolif

#### The aff's attempt to regulate arms proliferation in other countries is entrenched in Orientalist ideology -- it recreates the West versus the rest divide and rationalizes the deprivation of Third World countries in favor of a "stability" which only solidifies Western control over the rest of the world

[It became difficult to address problems of justice in practices of arms
control]{.underline} and disarmament [as those engaged in these
practices of control suffered from a crisis of memory,]{.underline} an
intellectual amnesia [that enabled a forgetfulness of their]{.underline}
past [history]{.underline}. Stuart Croft observes that 'arms control has
a long and rich history across many different cultures' but 'there has
been little emphasis on the historical record of arms control'.93 Croft
does not seek to explore the motivations but is content to note that
'**[too often, arms control is seen in too restricted a historical
perspective]{.underline}**; in too narrow a sense in terms of its
purposes; and in too shallow a fashion in terms of its complexity'.94 It
can be argued that [**the politics behind this**]{.underline} short
memory **[is to encourage theoretical abstractions pertaining to arms
control premised on deterrence]{.underline}**. Deterrence projected as
an exercise in rationality also represented an exercise in 'abstraction'
to guide practices towards vertical arms control among the superpowers.
[A more empirical exercise towards non-proliferation sought to develop
horizontal regulations of behaviour]{.underline} [among other
nation-states]{.underline}. These 344 CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY
Contemporary Security Policy 2014.35:332-355. empirical practices of
non-proliferation generated resistance among the nation-states through
the discourse of 'nuclear apartheid'. Hugh Gusterson does not hesitate
to contend that: Although the Non-Proliferation Treaty divided the
countries of the world into nuclear and nonnuclear by means of a purely
temporal metric -- designating only those who had tested nuclear weapons
by 1970 as nuclear powers -- **[the treaty had become the legal anchor
for a global nuclear regime that is increasingly legitimated in Western
public discourse in racialized terms.]{.underline}** 95 Gusterson
suggests that **[this was facilitated with the deployment of 'subtle
orientalist ideologies' by the West in an effort to essentialize the
Otherness of the Third World]{.underline}** vis-a\`-vis the West.96
Furthermore, [the West sought to represent itself as a]{.underline}
collective [ideological front that: (1) makes the simultaneous ownership
of nuclear weapons]{.underline} [by the major powers and the absence of
nuclear weapons in the Third World seem natural]{.underline} and
reasonable [while problematizing attempts by such countries as India,
Pakistan, and Iraq to acquire these weapons;]{.underline} (2) [it
presents the security needs of the established nuclear powers as if they
were everybody's]{.underline}; (3) **[it effaces the continuity between
Third World countries' nuclear deprivation and other systematic patterns
of deprivation in the underdeveloped world]{.underline}** in order to
inhibit a massive North-South confrontation; and (4) it legitimates the
nuclear monopoly of the recognized nuclear powers.97 [The struggle for
legitimacy to acquire nuclear weapons is]{.underline} [fought further on
the grounds that:]{.underline} (1) Third World countries are too poor to
afford nuclear weapons; (2) [deterrence will be unstable in the Third
World]{.underline}; (3) [Third World regimes lack the technical maturity
to be trusted with nuclear weapons;]{.underline} and (4) [Third World
regimes lack the political maturity to be trusted]{.underline} [with
nuclear weapons.98 In this struggle for legitimacy,]{.underline} '**[the
claim to rational decision-making is frequently used by great powers to
justify the possession of nuclear weapons. Conversely]{.underline}**,
**[the purported lack of rationality, on the part of other
states]{.underline}**, particularly revolutionary regimes
**[like]{.underline}** Cuba or **[Iran]{.underline}**,
**[is]{.underline}** routinely **[invoked to explain why they cannot be
trusted with nuclear weapons'.]{.underline}**99 [The existing literature
on arms control]{.underline} and disarmament [is replete with rhetorical
polarizations]{.underline} [that depict the West as the trustworthy and
responsible actor that needs to police the rebellious and recalcitrant
Third World]{.underline} that is not up to the task, [whose science and
technology is not even capable of addressing their basic
population]{.underline} and food [problems]{.underline} and is
constantly seeking attention. [All these 'recurrent images]{.underline}
and metaphors \... [pertain]{.underline} in some way [to

representations of the Other' is that they also disclose]{.underline}**
**[the West's 'buried]{.underline}**, denied, and **[troubling
parts]{.underline}** that have mysteriously surfaced'.101 **[The West

civilized behaviour and the other is not,]{.underline} history is, alas,

and disarmament are practices to facilitate binding the barbarians by
particular norms of civilized behaviour]{.underline}**. **[It

### Techno Orientalism

#### The aff's representations of the East are a techno-orientalist move to power predicated on preserving American anxieties about Asian techno-dominance to coerce the public into fear and hatred of Non-Western countries

**Yeats 15** Dylan Yeats, "Home Is Where the War Is": Remaking
Techno-Orientalist Militarism on the Homefront", in *Techno-Orientalism:
Imagining Asia in Speculative Fiction, History, and Media*, Chapter 9,
Rutgers University Press, pg 126-128, 2018, /MegLak

Excavating the genealogy of Homefront and its imaginative reworking of
U.S. foreign policy rhetoric can help elucidate the "techno" in the term
"techno-Orientalism[." **Techno-Orientalism describes texts that produce
visions of the purportedly technologically sophisticated economies and
peoples of East Asia as foils for Western anxieties about the digital or
information age**]{.underline}. Homefront and the 2012 remake of Red
Dawn register these anxieties quite precisely. In both texts [North
Koreans use an electromagnetic pulse to disable the communication
systems upon which the U.S. military depends]{.underline}, and the
invaders quickly take much of America. [This techno-Orientalist peril is
reminiscent of James Hevia's reading of the early twentieth-century Dr.
Fu Manchu novels]{.underline}. Hevia argues that the "Devil Doctor's"
ability to repurpose the knowledge infrastructure underpinning the
British Empire for his own nefarious plots is what makes the character
so scary. [Homefront]{.underline} and Red Dawn [continue this tradition
of reworking anxieties about the reliance on a **fetishized notion of
information dominance by fixating on Oriental villains who upset the
fantasy of Western technological supremacy.** In the context of mounting
media fixation on cyber-security, **driven in part by political projects
to depict China**]{.underline} (I mean, North Korea) **[as trying to
hack America out of its role as military-technology
leader]{.underline}** (Singel[), the **fears expressed in**]{.underline}
the 2012 **[Red Dawn]{.underline}** in particular **[illustrate the
anxious stakes of techno-dominance]{.underline}**. The occupying North
Koreans have their own communications network, and the film's plot is
driven by a hunt to retrieve one of the invaders' radios, so the forces
regrouping in Free America can reverse engineer it. However, the film
explores the ramifications of this technological upset through the
ambivalent specter of the U.S. war in Iraq. Without computer guidance
systems or satellite telecommunications, the occupied Americans are
reduced to the status of Iraqis, dependent upon a technologically
superior invading force that claims to be their friend. The invading
North Koreans tout that they have come to liberate Americans from their
own failed leaders, but they will not tolerate insurrection. This won't
do for the Wolverines who launch the resistance using the moniker of
their high school mascot. Jed, a veteran who has just returned from
Iraq, convinces his budding guerrilla troops that they have an
advantage. The occupiers, he knows from experience, don't really want to
be there, whereas the Wolverines are fighting for their home and
freedom. Jed claims that both the Viet Cong and America's Founding
Fathers knew that guerrilla tactics could drive imperialists away by
wearing them down. In this way, the 2012 Red Dawn seems to suggest a
deeply ambivalent circular logic. [The North Koreans serve as a
harbinger for America. Should American military technology fail, America
will be occupied the way it has occupied others. But in the hands of the
film's enemy Orientals, America's own strategy is revealed to be
terrifying and immoral]{.underline}; and [given the U.S. experience in
Iraq]{.underline} (and Vietnam) [we know that this occupying technology
cannot succeed. The overlapping and contradictory identifications
expressed in Red Dawn and Homefront between Iraqis, North Koreans,
Chinese, Vietnamese, and Russians]{.underline} (and the list could, and
does, go on) **[illustrate the polymorphous Orientalism at play in these
texts. This displacement of enmity reflects a broader tradition of
American war-gaming]{.underline}**. Red Dawn (2012) producer Tripp
Vinson stated he was interested in remaking the 1984 original because he
had enjoyed it as a kid and thought "the idea of an invading army is
something that speaks to the American psyche" (Hasan). However, [the
American psyche is not static, but continually reproduced, remade, and
cultivated by image makers backed by the power of the
state.]{.underline} Since World War II, [politicians]{.underline} and
pundits [have used the specter of "Oriental" enemy invasions to scare
Americans into defending themselves against a succession of intractable
foes by embracing the emancipatory promise of military
technology]{.underline}. Defenders and definers of America have replaced
Soviet communism with new archenemies across East Asia and the Middle
East. Cyberwar has replaced the Space Race. [The ease of this transition
suggests how the shifting goals of U.S. policy, not any overarching
immutable cultural or geostrategic affinity across the "Orient," shape
how Americans understand the implicit "Eastern" threats to an imagined
"West]{.underline}." This complements Edward Said's central contention
that the Orient is not a real place that experts in the West analyze:
[the Orient is a fantasy, produced by analysts with the power to assert
its existence]{.underline}. [Adding "techno"]{.underline} to Orientalism
[registers the embeddedness of such civilizational logic within the
sixty-year American struggle for military industrial
techno-dominance]{.underline} in the supposedly epic contest over the
fate of the world. As remakes, [Red Dawn and Homefront hint
at]{.underline} their participation in [the ongoing reproduction of
techno-Orientalist militarism at the heart of the U.S. political
culture]{.underline}. These texts hail a tradition of attacking
Americans in order to convince them they are, or could be, under attack
from so-called Orientals. Key to this tradition of making and remaking
techno-Orientalist militarism were a succession of groups named the
Committee on the Present Danger (CPD). In 1950, a group of establishment
elites founded the first CPD to promote the military to foster an
"American Century" rooted in free trade by challenging Soviet attempts
to close off global markets. To do so, this CPD depicted the Soviet
threat to America as a zero-sum game. Behind closed doors in Washington,
the CPD stewarded the adoption of the secret NSC-68 memoranda shortly
before the Korean War. NSC-68 was the ultimate techno- Orientalist
document, describing the Soviet Union as a "fanatical," "intractable,"
"inescapably militant" enemy "antithetical" to the existence of freedom
and Western "civilization" (Pietz). NSC-68 advocated removing Cold War
strategy from congressional oversight and placing it squarely in the
charge of a vastly expanded military to develop a technological
supremacy that could bolster freedom and counter communism any- and
everywhere. Under the banner of anticommunism Americans launched a
program of mutually assured destruction and the development of brutal
countersubversive campaigns at home and abroad (Sanders 23--50).

### HR

#### Human rights are anti-black and reproduce logics of settler colonialism 

**Yang**, K. W. (**2015**). Ph.D., 2004, Social and Cultural Studies,
University of California, Berkeley \[Afterword: Will Human Rights
Education Be Decolonizing? Bringing Human Rights Education to US
Classrooms, 225--235. doi:10.1057/9781137471130_13 \] //rm

This book leads us to this question, to this edge, about what human
rights education (HRE) will do in a world of empire. The voices in this
book whispered, and sometimes shouted, descriptions of human rights
beyond the current legal definitions of human rights. They described the
intimate, personal, and profound rights to a heartbeat, to a
self-determined future, to a sexuality, a culture, a language, and an
intact being---"the basic right to be who you are" in Olga Talamante's
words (Foreword, this book). These diminutive yet profound human rights
are real and real important. [Human Rights are related yet not the same:
they are a legal promise that one day all people will have the
entitlements that only the privileged enjoy.]{.underline} While reading
this book, the edge between human and the Human kept appearing for me at
the borders between the personal and powerful nation-state formations
like the United States and the United Nations. Talamante's organizing
for the tortured and disappeared in Argentina, and Durán's discussion of
the UN human rights mission in Haiti (chapter 7, this book), teaches us
that sometimes the promise-makers must be kept at arms reach. Too often,
if not always, [the very powers that enforce Human Rights are the human
rights violators]{.underline}, as felt so keenly by the Black Panther
Party SF8 (Blundell, chapter 3, this book). [The violators can be
invisible, hidden behind structures of violation. Sometimes we may gain
some human entitlements by gaining access to structures that violate,
"humiliate and mutilate"]{.underline} someone else elsewhere, to draw on
the words of Malcolm X (1964b, p. 75). [This book illuminates human
rights contradictions. How is it that everyone is supposed to have them,
yet the reality is that most people do not? How is that the United
Nations guarantees them, but the United Nations violates them**? These
contradictions must be confounding for students.**]{.underline} For me,
the roots of these contradictions lie in the modern condition, which is
a colonial condition. [Decolonizing education stems from traditions of
interrogating one's colonial condition as a local problem and a world
problem at onc]{.underline}e. Ruth Wilson Gilmore (2014) says it is the
Black Radical Tradition, drawing on the words of Cedric Robinson and on
the life of Harriet Tubman. For Gilmore, this tradition "has accumulated
since the first instant that chattel slavery came into being" (p. 232).
Not just limited to people of African descent, the Black Radical
Tradition is shorthand for freedom fighting and freedom dreaming that is
lifetimes long, for which "the survival of the collective is the purpose
of life . . . our lives should unroll as a narrative of freedom" (p.
232). Decolonizing education also stems from Indigenous
survivance---life narratives of vitality and active presence beyond
naked survival (Vizenor, 1999). Linda Tuhiwai Smith (1999) states that
for now, the decolonizing imperatives before Indigenous communities are
clear: "the survival of peoples, cultures, languages; the struggle to
become self-determining, the need to take back control of our destinies"
(p. 142). Because colonialism is vested in the settlement of Indigenous
lands, and the enslavement of Indigenous people-turned-property, then to
decolonize is to unsettle Indigenous lands and to abolish slavery, that
is, to abolish the carving of land/people into pieces of property
(Spillers, 1987; Tuck and Yang, 2012). So on the surface, decolonizing
and HRE may seem perfectly compatible[**. However, the legal concept of
"Human" has continued to mean a settler and a property owner whose
"Rights" to land, life, and liberty are actually entitlements enforced
by settler nation-states.** For people of color in the United States,
achieving human status has historically meant to masquerade as
propertied settlers]{.underline}. Consider the US Supreme Court civil
rights cases of Takao Ozawa (1922) and Bhagat Singh Thind (1923). Each
appealed for rights by actually suing for status as a white propertied
man. [Human status might provide a pathway toward human rights. But
**achieving it may require you to act like "the man":** **anti-black,
anti-Indigenous, pro-empire, and prosettler**. In]{.underline} [this
way, settler nations offer a seductive way for you or I to solve an
individual problem of nonhuman status: become a settler.]{.underline}
But this won't solve the collective problem of colonialism. [For HRE to
be decolonizing depends on our willingness to denaturalize the category
of Human]{.underline}, to practice red pedagogy (Grande, 2004) as an
alternative to critical pedagogy (Freire, 2000). Whereas critical
pedagogy highlights the human as the unit of liberation, a red pedagogy
already understands how the human cannot be exceptionalized from land,
water, and from "nature." A red pedagogy interrogates human rights
vis-a-vis Indigenous land rights. We might start by contrasting the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) with the United Nations
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). We might
proceed by following the ghost of Malcolm X.

[A trade depression in the 1770s followed by defeats in a series of
frontier wars with the Xhosa people adversely affected Cape farmers,
who, in keeping with the era of bourgeois democratic revolutions,
demanded free trade and an end to the Dutch East India Company's
monopoly. Ultimately, the British seized Cape Colony with the support of
the Afrikaner settler population, but the decimation of the Khoikhoi
population and the abolition of the slave trade in 1807 only exacerbated
the ongoing labor shortage.]{.underline} They tried importing white
indentured laborers, but the costs proved prohibitive, and many ran away
into the interior and set up their own farms. [By the early nineteenth
century, the Cape Colony had to create an elaborate system of coercive
labor control, pass laws, and labor contracts, which became even more
crucial with the abolition of slavery in the Cape in 1833. Settler
expansion and the discovery of mineral wealth created]{.underline} three
[more colonies]{.underline}---Natal, Orange Free State, and the
Transvaal. [All three were also beset with labor shortages and depended
**on the coercive arm of the state to help transform indigenous Africans
into a proletariat**]{.underline}. In Natal, for example, [the settler
state introduced a system of "native locations" or reservations,
designed not to sustain the population but to force people to sign
long-term labor con- tracts to survive. As sugar production increased,
so did the labor demands]{.underline}, [compelling the British to employ
what had become its global labor policy in the postabolition
era]{.underline}: import contract labor from India, China, and other
parts of Asia. In the Orange Free State, [taxation and coercion were
employed to dispossess Africans and turn them into agricultural laborers
or tenant farmers. However, an enterprising African peasantry adapted to
the market economy and thrived, particularly after the diamond rush to
Kimberly. Because they competed with white farmers who needed labor and
demanded higher prices for their goods, laws were passed prohibiting
African land ownership and impos- ing more stringent systems of contract
labor]{.underline}. Likewise, commercial agriculture dominated the
Transvaal economy until gold was discovered there in 1886. Mining
companies and [white farmers conspired to pass laws prohibiting Black
land ownership and squatting, and in order to ensure a racially
segmented labor force, the state denied Black workers the right to
strike and reserved all skilled jobs for whites only]{.underline}. With
the unification of South Africa in 1910, local policies of expropriation
became the national policy, culminating in the Land Act of 1913,
extending the reserve system of Natal and Cape Colony to the rest of the
country. [The law forced Africans to live in the reserves, squeez- ing
87 percent of the population onto 13 percent of the land and ensuring a
consistent flow of labor to mines and white farms.]{.underline}9
Obviously, [the history of settler colonialism in South Africa is far
more complex and, in fact, the rise of the Afrikaner National Party in
1948 and the introduction of apartheid, and ascent of the Rhodesian
Front in southern Rhodesia in 1962, signaled a strengthening of white
settler rule just as most African colonies were achieving independence.
The growth in manufacturing increased US investment in mining and
finance, and urbanization attracted a new wave of European
immigration]{.underline}.10 By eliding settler colonialism in Africa,
Traces of History not only fails to account for labor regimes in which
the native is simultaneously "eliminated" and exploited; it forecloses a
discussion of what it means to decolonize settler societies. [In
Algeria, Kenya, and Mozambique, decolonization involved the withdrawal
of settlers who had never intended to leave, whereas in Zimbabwe and
South Africa the white settler population continues to exist but no lon-
ger rules. Whether the structure of settler colonialism persists or can
ever be fully dismantled is a critical source of debate in the
historiography.]{.underline} "If settler colonization," Veracini writes,
"is an ultimate colonising act where settlers envisage no return,
settler colonialism still tells a story of either total victory or total
failure. Discontinuing settler colonial forms requires conceptual frames
and supporting narratives of reconciliation that have yet to be fully
developed and narrated. [Nation building in formerly colonized contexts
can be difficult, but at least it can be conceptualized; enacting
genuine postsettler passages in white settler nations is another
matter]{.underline}."11 The question, in other words, is far from being
resolved, especially if we understand decolonization as a process rather
than an event. In South Africa, decolonization was not achieved with the
election of Nelson Mandela; it is an ongoing process requiring truth and
reconciliation. For others, decolonization is envisioned in the African
National Congress's (ANC) 1955 Freedom Charter, which adopts a socialist
vision of restoring the land and wealth to the people, an industrial
democracy based on the nationalization of resources and shared
governance. [There is also a neoliberal version of decolonization based
on a multicultural framework of tolerating difference and equal
political rights for all, but as Veracini argues, it "allows for an
expanded definition of who can claim belonging to the settler body
politic that leaves settler colonial structures
unchallenged]{.underline}."12 What about Europe? If settlers always come
from elsewhere, how far is else- where? Can we think about the legacies
of settler colonialism in Europe itself? In Black Marxism, Robinson
argues that racialization within Europe was very much a colonial
process---one involving invasion, settlement, expropriation, and racial
hierarchy. He reminds us that driving German colonization of central
Europe and "Slavic" territories was the ideology of herrenvolk, which
"explained the inevitability and the naturalness of the domination of
some Europeans by other Europeans."13 He argues that modern European
nationalism was bound up with these racialist myths---herrenvolk,
Anglo-Saxonism, Celtism, Aryan and Nordic myths, and so forth, and that
the [history of colonialism begins in Europe---and continues in Europe
well after New World settler colonialism, well after the Berlin
Conference, and is a principal feature in both world wars.]{.underline}
Robinson illustrates his point by examining the shifting, and
increasingly violent, character of English colonization of Ireland in
the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Planters and farmers
from Scotland and the western counties of England settled large swaths
of land---by some estimates 260,000 Protestant colonists---followed by
the rebellion of 1641 and deepening repres- sion of the Irish (known as
the Penal Era). What he describes echoes Wolfe's descriptions of the
racialization of indigenous peoples by dispossession, except they cannot
be entirely disappeared. Those who are not killed are dispersed, often
ending up as indentures on ships to the New World or migrant labor on
the English mainland. Robinson observes that these historical
experiences shaped Irish nationalism and determined the Irish
relationship with their Eng- lish working-class counterparts. And he
goes on to show how the Irish came to be understood as "an inferior
race." The main point, as Robinson puts it, is that "[the tendency of
European civilization through capitalism was thus not to homogenize but
to differentiate---to exaggerate regional, subcultural, and dialectical
differences into 'racial' ones]{.underline}."14 But here Wolfe would
disagree with Robinson. Though both Robinson and Wolfe treat race as a
"trace history," the former pushes the genesis of racialism much
earlier, even before the first signs of merchant capital in the
thirteenth century, whereas the latter (Wolfe) sees race as "a
distinctive configuration of ideological elements that we do not find
configured in this way before the late eighteenth century." For Wolfe,
[race comes into being "with the shift from mercantilism to an
industrial economy, which transformed colonial social organisation in
the century following the Enlightenment]{.underline}." The problem with
this formulation, of course, is that it will almost always see the
enactment of race making occurring outside Europe, by way of encoun-
tering the other, and the idea of race a product of Enlightenment
rationality and scientific classification, rather than see both
processes as deeply embedded in Western civilization. [This bifurcation
separates or occludes the processes of dispossession, racialization, and
colonization within Europe from the settler colonial
project]{.underline}. To be clear, I am not suggesting that Robinson
treats racializa- tion as transhistorical, fixed over time; rather, for
him, it is extremely unstable and always changing. And he, too, traces
the genesis of modern racism to the eighteenth century.15 In fact,
Robinson insists that while the power of racial regimes is real and
formidable, they are surprisingly unstable. He writes: "The covering
conceit of a racial regime is a makeshift patchwork masquerading as
memory and the immutable. Nevertheless, racial regimes do possess
history, that is, discernible origins and mechanisms of assembly. But
racial regimes are unrelentingly hostile to their exhibition."16 This is
the sort of history Patrick Wolfe begins to write in Traces of History,
and he does so brilliantly. But I do think it demands a wider geographic
optic. [The study of settler colonialism in Africa avoids the tendency
to reduce Africans to the category of slave labor, to ignore how the
principle of terra nullius was applied to parts of Africa, and
challenges the assertion that settlers want land and not indigenous
labor, or that settler rule is almost indestructible.]{.underline} [And
to turn the lens to settler regimes inside Europe may help us understand
the dynamic and shifting categories of class---or how it is possible to
move from native to colonized, to dispossessed, to proletarian, to
unfree laborer, to settler (and from "Black" to "white") in a single
generation]{.underline}.

### Extinction

#### Colonial IR justifies extermination -- their invocation of human extinction is an ideological move to absolve us of responsibility for the consequences of imperialism

**Saurin 06** (Julian Saurin, B.S., University of Southampton, Ph.D.,
University of Southampton Associate Professor of IR and Poly Sci
"International Relations as the Imperial Illusion; or, the Need to
Decolonize IR in Decolonizing International Relations" 2006)

Whatever the paucity of references to or uses of the history of the
colonized (subaltern and otherwise dispossessed), [IR scholarship is
able to present the colonized as much through omission and unspoken
assumption as by direct reference.]{.underline} There are four principal
(and no doubt complementary) paths one can take in exposing the nature
and effects of these omissions and assumptions. First, there is the
general critique of Eurocentrism in which [the]{.underline} now global
dominance, indeed [intellectual hegemony, of]{.underline} the European
\"[enlightenment\" social scientific traditions has effected the
silencing or permanent subordination of subaltern
knowledge]{.underline}, including historical knowledge. Here,
\"subaltern\" and \"colonized\" are synonymous. Second, there is the
profoundly important critique of \"oriental ism\" in which the Western
imagination tells us little or nothing about \"the rest\" but everything
about the West. Here, \" nothing\" and \"the rest\" are synonymous.
Third, there is the recording, tracing, and critique of [the profound
political economic inequalities that were generated by colonial (or
imperial) international order and that]{.underline} have [resulted in
the **perennial extermination** of the colonized]{.underline}. Here,
\"colonial order\" and \"inequality\" are synonymous. Finally, one could
demonstrate the contradiction, partiality, differentiation, and
inconsistency of ostensibly universalist doctrines, most obviously of
human rights and human equality, in the constitution of the colonial (or
imperial) order. Here, \"partiality\" and \"universality\" are
synonymous. The removal or discounting of the subordinated from their
own history is secured often through the simplest of techniques, such as
in the repetition of simple phrases. Thus, in his critical assessment of
Said\'s work, Bruce Robbins takes Disraeli\'s imperial dictum that \"the
East is a career\" and comments that his phrase is briefly and
brilliantly offensive. Activating the convention by which an empty,
immobile point on the compass is held capable of condensing millions of
undescribed personal destinies, the sentence equates these missing
millions with a single individual \'s rising curve of professional
accomplishment. The individual who is to enjoy the career is elided, as
if in pretense of equal exchange for the elision of the colossal human
diversity that is to be its raw material; in the space of symmetrical
impersonality thus cleared , the static East can be spurred into
movement, metamorphosed into the kinesis of a (Western) \'·pursuit.,,25
So, in a phrase, is captured the essence of imperial administration and
the attitude to subject peoples. And [it is the task of overturning a
deep and long established attitude that any call for decolonizing lR
must face]{.underline} . This attitude in fact tells the story of
Western supremacy-its historical and historiographical evolution- by
presupposing Western supremacism. Guha identifies the problem clearly
when he counterposes Hegel\'s characterization of world history with
what is historically entailed in the production of that world history.
Thus, quoting Hegel, world history moves on a higher plane than that to
which morality properly belongs \.... The deeds of great men who are
individuals of world history . .. appear justified not only in their
inner significance \... but also in a secular sense.26 In this way, the
historical function and purpose of the imperial nation or state is
presented as already peculiar and elevated and not prone to the limiting
conditions and considerations that characterize the subordinate. What
does this abstraction mean concretely? [Imperialism is author of
history, author of law, author of historical subject, author of
indictment, author of judgment.]{.underline} For example, \"[By
**inventing a universal humanity** and endowing this juridical
abstraction with inalienable rights, it absolved Europe of crimes both
past and future]{.underline} ,\" Bess is opines before asking whether
\"[Enlightenment thought, like storm-bearing Clouds, already carries
future horrors within it, formulating the limits of universality in such
a way as to make Europe its sole guardian]{.underline}?\"27
Correspondingly, Guha argues that [from the point of view of those left
out of World-history this advice amounts to **condoning**]{.underline}
precisely such \" world-hi storical deeds\"-[the **rape of continents,
the destruction of cultures, the poisoning of the
environment**]{.underline}-as helpe[d \" the great men who \[were\] the
individuals of world history\" to build empires and trap their subject
populations]{.underline} in what in the pseudo-historical language of
imperialism could describe as Prehistory.28 [Imperial rule makes itself
known as imperial rule through the power of universalizing its own story
and **self-validating its own story**]{.underline}. The twin of this is
to deprive the subordinated of the capacity to tell their own story and
to determine an alternative legitimation and self-validation. (33-4)

#### The aff's spectacularized claims of extinction are an act of settler futurity that hide the ongoing violence of settler colonialism

**Dalley 16** Dr. Hamish Dalley is an assistant professor of English at
Daemen College and teaches in the areas of ancient and modern world
literature, contemporary literatures from South Asia, Africa, and the
Caribbean, first-year writing and literature, and postcolonial studies.
He also serves on the college's Council for Diversity and Inclusion and
the Global Education Task Force. "The deaths of settler colonialism:
extinction as a metaphor of decolonization in contemporary settler
literature", Settler Colonial Studies. 2016.

[Settlers love to contemplate the possibility of their own
extinction]{.underline}; to read many contemporary literary
representations of settler colonialism is to find settlers strangely
satisfied in dreaming of ends that never come. This tendency is widely
prevalent in English-language representations of settler colonialism
produced since the 1980s: the possibility of an ending -- [the
likelihood that the settler race will one day die out -- is a common
theme in]{.underline} literary and pop culture co[nsiderations of
colonialism's future. Yet it has barely been remarked how surprising it
is that this theme is so present. For settlers, of all people, to
obsessively ruminate on their own finitude is counterintuitive, for few
modern social formations have been more resistant to change than settler
colonialism.]{.underline} With a few exceptions (French Algeria being
the largest), the [settler societies]{.underline} established in the
last 300 years in the Americas, Australasia, and Southern Africa [have
all retained the basic features that define them as settler states --
namely, the structural privileging of settlers at the expense of
indigenous peoples, and the normalization of whiteness as the marker of
political agency and rights -- and they have done so notwithstanding the
sustained resistance]{.underline} trading as that has been mounted
whenever such an order has been built. [Settlers think all the time that
they might one day end, even though (perhaps because) that ending seems
unlikely ever to happen]{.underline}. The significance of this paradox
for settler-colonial literature is the subject of this article[.
Considering the problem of futurity offers a useful foil to traditional
analyses of settler colonial narrative, which typically examine
settlers' attitudes towards history in order to highlight a constitutive
anxiety about the past -- about origins]{.underline}. Settler
colonialism, the argument goes, has a problem with historical narration
that arises from a contradiction in its founding mythology. In Stephen
Turner's formulation, [the settler]{.underline} subject is by definition
one who [comes from elsewhere but]{.underline} who [strives to make this
place home. The settlement narrative must explain how this gap -- which
is at once geographical, historical, and existential -- has been
bridged, and the settler transformed from outsider into indigene. Yet
the transformation must remain constitutively incomplete, because the
desire to be at home necessarily invokes the spectre of the native,
whose existence (which cannot be disavowed completely because it is
needed to define the settler's difference, superiority, and hence claim
to the land) inscribes the settler's foreignness, thus reinstating the
gap between settler and colony that the narrative was meant to
efface]{.underline}.1 [Settler-colonial narrative is thus shaped around
its need to erase and evoke the native, to make the indigene both
invisible and present in a contradictory pattern that prevents settlers
from ever moving on from the moment of colonization]{.underline}.2 As
evidence of this constitutive contradiction, critics have identified in
settler-colonial discourse symptoms of psychic distress such as
disavowal, inversion, and repression.3 Indeed, [the frozen temporality
of settler-colonial narrative, fixated on the moment of the frontier,
recalls nothing so much as]{.underline} Freud's description of the
'[repetition compulsion' attending trauma]{.underline}.4 As Lorenzo
Veracini puts it, [because: 'settler society' can thus be seen as a
fantasy where a perception of a constant struggle is juxtaposed against
an ideal of 'peace' that can never be reached, settler projects embrace
and reject violence at the same time]{.underline}. The settler colonial
situation is thus a circumstance where the tension between contradictory
impulses produces long-lasting psychic conflicts and a number of
associated psychopathologies.5 [Current scholarship has thus focused
primarily on settler-colonial narrative's view of the past]{.underline},
asking how such a contradictory and troubled relationship to history
might affect present-day ideological formations. Critics have [rarely
considered what such narratological tensions might produce when the
settler gaze is turned to the futur]{.underline}e. [Few social
formations are more stubbornly resistant to change than settlement,
suggesting that a future beyond settler colonialism might be simply
unthinkable.]{.underline} Veracini, indeed, suggests that
settler-colonial narrative can never contemplate an ending: that settler
decolonization is inconceivable because settlers lack the metaphorical
tools to imagine their own demise.6 This article outlines why I partly
disagree with that view. I argue that the narratological paradox that
defines settler-colonial narrative does make the future a problematic
object of contemplation. But that does not make settler decolonization
unthinkable per se; as I will show, [settlers do often try to imagine
their demise -- but they do so in a way that reasserts the paradoxes of
their founding ideology, with the result that the radical potentiality
of decolonization is undone even as it is invoked]{.underline}. I argue
that, notwithstanding Veracini's analysis, there is a metaphor via which
the end of settler colonialism unspools -- [the quasi-biological concept
of extinction, which, when deployed as a narrative trope, offers
settlers a chance to consider and disavow their demise, just as they
consider and then disavow the violence of their origins.]{.underline}
This article traces the importance of the trope of extinction for
contemporary settler-colonial literature, with a focus on South Africa,
Canada, and Australia. It explores variations in how the death of
settler colonialism is conceptualized, drawing a distinction between
historio-civilizational narratives of the rise and fall of empires, and
a species-oriented notion of extinction that draws force from public
anxiety about climate change -- an invocation that adds another level of
ambivalence by drawing on 'rational' fears for the future (because
climate change may well render the planet uninhabitable to humans) in
order to narrativize a form of social death that, strictly speaking,
belongs to a different order of knowledge altogether. As such, my
analysis is intended to draw the attention of settlercolonial studies
toward futurity and the ambivalence of settler paranoia, while
highlighting a potential point of cross-fertilization between
settler-colonial and eco-critical approaches to contemporary literature.
[That 'extinction' should be a key word in the settler-colonial lexicon
is no surprise.]{.underline} In Patrick Wolfe's phrase,7 [settler
colonialism is predicated on a 'logic of elimination' that tends towards
the extermination -- by one means or another -- of indigenous
peoples]{.underline}.8 This logic is apparent in archetypal settler
narratives like James Fenimore Cooper's The Last of the Mohicans (1826),
a historical novel whose very title blends the melancholia and triumph
that demarcate settlers' affective responses to the supposed
inevitability of indigenous extinction. [Concepts like]{.underline}
'stadial development' -- by which societies [progress]{.underline}
through stages, progressively eliminating earlier social forms -- and
'fatal impact' -- which names the biological inevitability of strong
peoples supplanting weak -- all [contribute to the notion
that]{.underline} [settler colonialism is a kind of 'ecological process'
9 that necessitates the extinction of inferior races.]{.underline} [What
is surprising, though, is how often the trope of extinction also appears
with reference to settlers themselves; it makes sense for settlers to
narrate how their presence entails others' destruction, but it is less
clear why their attempts to imagine futures should presume extinction to
be their own logical end as well.]{.underline} The idea appears
repeatedly in English-language literary treatments of settler
colonialism. Consider, for instance, the following rumination on the
future of South African settler society, from Olive Schreiner's 1883
Story of an African Farm: It was one of them, one of those wild old
Bushmen, that painted those pictures there. He did not know why he
painted but he wanted to make something, so he made these. \[...\] Now
the Boers have shot them all, so that we never see a yellow face peeping
out among the stones. \[...\] And the wild bucks have gone, and those
days, and we are here. But we will be gone soon, and only the stones
will lie on, looking at everything like they look now.10 In this
example, the narrating settler character, Waldo, recognizes prior
indigenous inhabitation but his knowledge comes freighted with an
expected sense of biological superiority, made apparent by his
description of the 'Bushman's' 'yellow face', and lack of mental
self-awareness. What is not clear is why Waldo's contemplation of
colonial genocide should turn immediately to the assumption that a
similar fate awaits his people as well. A similar presumption of racial
vulnerability permeates other late nineteenthcentury novels from the
imperial metropole, such as Dracula and War of the Worlds, SETTLER
COLONIAL STUDIES 3 which are plotted around the prospect of invasions
that would see the extinction of British imperialism, and, in the
process, the human species. Such anxieties draw energy from a pattern of
settler defensiveness that can be observed across numerous
settler-colonial contexts. Marilyn Lake's and Henry Reynold's account of
the emergence of transnational 'whiteness' highlights the paradoxical
fact that while white male settlers have been arguably the most
privileged class in history, they have routinely perceived themselves to
be 'under siege', threatened with destruction to the extent that their
very identity of 'whiteness was born in the apprehension of imminent
loss'. [11 The fear of looming annihilation serves a powerful
ideological function in settler communities, working to foster racial
solidarity, suppress dissent, and legitimate violence against indigenous
populations who, by any objective measure, are far more at risk of
extermination than the settlers who fear them]{.underline}. Ann Curthoys
and Dirk Moses have traced this pattern in Australia and
Israel-Palestine, respectively.12 This scholarship suggests [that
narratives of settler extinction are acts of ideological mystification,
obscuring the brutal inequalities of the frontier behind a mask of white
vulnerability]{.underline} -- an argument with which I sympathize.
However, this article shows how [there is more to settler-colonial
extinction narratives than bad faith. I argue that we need a more
nuanced understanding of how they encode a specifically settler-colonial
framework for imagining the future, one that has implications for how we
understand contemporary literatures from settler societies, and which
allows us to see extinction as a genuine, if flawed, attempt to envisage
social change]{.underline}. In the remainder of this paper I consider
extinction's function as a metaphor of decolonization. I use this phrase
to invoke, without completely endorsing, Tuck and Yang's argument that
to treat decolonization figuratively, as I argue extinction narratives
do, is necessarily to preclude radical change, creating opportunities
for settler 'moves to innocence' that re-legitimate racial inequality.13
The counterview to this pessimistic perspective is offered by Veracini,
who suggests that [progressive change to settler-colonial relationships
will only happen if narratives can be found that make decolonization
thinkable]{.underline}.14 This article enters the debate between these
two perspectives by asking what it means for settler writers to imagine
the future via the trope of extinction. [Does extinction offer a
meaningful way to think about ending settler colonialism, or does it
re-activate settler-colonial patterns of thought that allow exclusionary
social structures to persist?]{.underline} I explore this question with
reference to examples of contemporary literary treatments of extinction
from select English-speaking settler-colonial contexts: South Africa,
Australia, and Canada.15 The next section of this article traces key
elements of extinction narrative in a range of settler-colonial texts,
while the section that follows offers a detailed reading of one of the
best examples of a sustained literary exploration of human finitude,
Margaret Atwood's Maddaddam trilogy (2003--2013). I advance four
specific arguments. First, [extinction narratives take at least two
forms depending on whether the 'end' of settler society is framed
primarily in historical-civilizational terms or in a stronger,
biological sense; the key question is whether the 'thing' that is going
extinct is a society or a species. Second, biologically oriented
extinction narratives rely on a more or less conscious slippage between
'the settler' and 'the human'. Third, this slippage is ideologically
ambivalent: on the one hand, it contains a radical charge that invokes
environmentalist discourse and climate-change anxiety to imagine social
forms that re-write settler-colonial dynamics; on the other, it
replicates a core aspect of imperialist ideology by normalizing
whiteness as equivalent to humanity. Fourth, these ideological effects
are mediated by gender, insofar as extinction narratives invoke issues
of biological reproduction, community protection, and violence that
function to differentiate and reify masculine and feminine roles in the
putative de-colonial future.]{.underline} Overall, my central claim is
that [extinction is a core trope through which settler futurity emerges,
one with crucial narrative and ideological effects that shape much of
the contemporary literature emerging from white colonial
settings]{.underline}.

[It is]{.underline} highly [significant that the]{.underline}
distinctive [characteristics of this]{.underline} emergent global
[regime have been locally prefigured in modes of repression developed
internally by settler colonial states.]{.underline} As Israeli architect
and specialist on urban warfare, Eyal Weizman, has argued, for instance,
**[the West Bank can be seen as an extreme model]{.underline}** --
perhaps a laboratory -- **[of a territorial and urban conflict that can
take place in other places]{.underline}**. Globalization takes the
periphery straight to the center, the frontier between the First and
Third worlds starts running through the middle of world cities.3
[Weizmann's phrasing signals a genealogy for contemporary
transformations in the longer history of colonialism as a repertoire
of]{.underline} both [tropes and practices of social
control,]{.underline} [brought together]{.underline} today [in Israel's
operations as a settler colonial state]{.underline}, anomalous only in
that its project of expansion remains unfinished.4 **[The]{.underline}**
notable **[convergence of Israel and the USA]{.underline}** (together
with an ever-compliant Australia), **[expressed as much in their
political solidarity as in their military and security collaborations,
suggests to us a wider historical affinity between states that share a
settler colonial history, one that continues to impress itself on both
psychic and institutional formations]{.underline}**. In this respect, to
Weizmann's invocation of the first and third worlds, we should add the
histories of dispossession and resistance through which
[Indigenous]{.underline} [peoples of the 'fourth world' have shaped our
understanding of the dynamics of settler colonialism]{.underline} and
its lessons for the present. We suggest that **[the]{.underline}**
fundamental **[continuity]{.underline}** **[between the historical
development of European settler colonialism and the present-day
development of the neoliberal world order resides in the exigencies of
managing surplus populations]{.underline}**. [So far as settlers have
been concerned]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} salient [surplus
has]{.underline}, of course, [been the Native population]{.underline},
**[whose refractory presence has prompted a range of techniques of
elimination]{.underline}** -- **[from]{.underline}** outright
**[homicide to various forms of removal and/ or confinement, and, once
their numbers have been appropriately reduced in the post-frontier era,
to Natives' assimilation into settler society]{.underline}** --
techniques that have met with mixed success in the face of Native modes
of resistance which have varied as creatively as the settlers' own
repertoire of strategies. In this overall historical process, [the key
shift is the ending of the frontier]{.underline}, [which]{.underline}
generally [coincides with the consolidation of the settler
state]{.underline}, and [which is typically]{.underline} [marked by
intensified programs of Native assimilation,]{.underline} so many
mopping-up exercises for civilization. Thus it is consistent that
**[Israel, which remains bogged down in an incomplete expansion of its
frontier, should rigorously eschew any semblance of Native assimilation,
insisting instead on the sharpest of distinctions between Palestinians,
who may or may not be citizen/residents of the Israeli state, and
members of the so-called 'Jewish nation' wherever they may
live]{.underline}**. [The exclusion of the Palestinian population is
particularly apparent in the ease with which shifting economic and
demographic circumstances]{.underline} -- especially the large-scale
immigration of Arab-Jews (Mizrahim) and Russians -- have transformed
what was once a reserve Palestinian labor force into a largely
unemployed surplus. Bereft of potential productive utility, and with
pauperization attenuating its value as a market, th**[e Palestinian
population has become subject to policies of removal]{.underline}** and
confinement **[that recall those adopted by other settler
states]{.underline}** while the expansion of their frontiers remained
incomplete. Locally, therefore**[, Israel is straightforwardly settler
colonial and bears comparison in important respects to the respective
histories of settler societies such as Australia or the
USA]{.underline}** in the eras before these societies had completed the
initial seizure of Native peoples' land and inheritances. Globally,
however, the twenty-first century context in which Israel is seeking to
complete the seizure of what remains of Mandate Palestine differs
crucially from the nineteenth-century Settler Colonial Studies 111
context in which settlers in Australia and North America completed their
seizure of the Native estate. Globally, the dispossession of Indigenous
peoples in Australia and North America took place in the context of (and
formatively enabled) the titanic growth of industrial capitalism. As
Karl Polanyi observed, doing scant justice to Marx, an unprecedented
feature of the emergence of industrial society was the sheer scale of
the investment that was involved in factories. Not even shipbuilding had
previously come close to the financial input required by the
establishment of factories, with their heavy plant and infrastructure.
Nor had any previous investment required maintenance for the length of
time that it took factories to become profitable. To vouchsafe these
investments, and to project factories' viability forward through
generations, required the total reorganization of society, complete with
novel forms of surveillance, policing and war-making, that marked
industrialization in the nineteenth century.5 This much is hardly novel.
For our purposes, the crucial feature of the great nineteenth-century
transformation is that it did not necessarily conduce to permanently
superfluous populations. Rather, working populations grew dramatically.
In addition to providing capital with its labor, the industrial
proletariat provided a market for the fruits of its own alienated
production. True, temporary labor surpluses were generated in the course
of the periodic slumps and depressions that overtook the capitalist
economy, especially after the 1870s, but this labor could be
re-employed, even if only for warfare, once industrial demand was
reinstated. Moreover, throughout this period, colonial settlement
provided an outlet for the Malthusian excess, industrial society's
surplus poor, who departed their Dickensian slums for Indigenous
people's stolen homelands.

hegemony of liberal whiteness' (1999: 121; see also Ahmed, 2004, 2012;
Giroux, 1997). She contends that while [Whiteness Studies seeks to
produce a white anti-racist subject that is disaffiliated from white
supremacy, this ultimately requires a re-articulation of whiteness, thus
reifying the material practices that give whiteness its power and
meaning]{.underline}. In other words, [seeking to disidentify from
liberal whiteness reconstitutes a kind of counter-whiteness that allows
white scholars and activists to hold onto the underlying structural
condition of white supremacy while disassociating themselves from the
'unearned' privileges of the present]{.underline}. Similarly, Sarah de
Leeuw, Margo Greenwood, and Nicole Lindsey (2013) problematize the 'good
intentions' of liberal scholars and academic policies ostensibly seeking
to redress racist and colonial histories (see also Ahmed, 2012; Berg,
2012). They argue that just as racial awareness has given rise to new
subjectivies shaped by 'good intentions' and the desire to be
anti-racist, subjective investments in unsettling colonialism are both
situated within and actively expanding settler colonialism. As with
Wiegman's (1999) critique of whiteness studies, De Leeuw, Greenwood, and
Lindsey argue that well-intended scholarship and policies -- produced
through white settler subjectivities and embedded within settler
institutions -- often rely on gestures rather than structural change,
which re-entrenches rather than destabilizes settler social formations.
[We are particularly interested in these lines of inquiry as we think
beyond white privilege to focus on white supremacy and settler
colonialism.]{.underline} **[Moreover, we've argued that there is much
to gain in engaging with the insights of settler colonialism in building
a more robustly anti-racist geography]{.underline}** (see De Leeuw et
al., 2013; De Leeuw, 2014; Hunt, 2014; Hunt and Holmes, 2015; Pasternak,
2015; Dempsey et al., 2011). [A settler colonial perspective illuminates
the interconnections between colonization and anti-black and
anti-indigenous racisms and understands them as an ongoing structure
rather than a series of historic events.]{.underline} The example of the
Bundy ranch is a 'colonial moment' (Kempf, 2010; Seawright, 2014),
illustrating the unremarked 'expansion of the settler state' and the
ways in which this social condition is premised on the interconnections
of racial hierarchies and place (Arvin et al., 2013: 10). While this
instance is grounded in a US context, [broader understandings of white
supremacy and settler colonialism that engage with processes of colonial
dispossession have the potential to broaden anti-racist and
anti-capitalist struggles]{.underline} (Inwood and Bonds, 2013). That
is, within settler colonial nation-states, one cannot challenge the
unfettered accumulation of capital without also advocating for
decolonization, and as a consequence, a robust anti-racist agenda cannot
be developed in settler nations without recognizing the material
conditions that gave rise to the differentially racialized geographies
(Pulido, 2006) of settler nations in the first place. Finally, [the lack
of a broader engagement with settler colonialism distorts our
understanding of the central and ongoing roles that genocide and slavery
play in the continuously and always unfolding white supremacist, settler
colonial landscape and leads to incomplete understandings of the role
race and whiteness continue to play in our everyday
geographies]{.underline}. The idea of race is mediated on and through
local histories that not only have come to define different groups, but
is also the result of historically grounded structures and struggles
(Allen, 2004). These historic struggles are important to contextualize
because they form the basis for processes of 'differential
racialization' (Pulido, 2006). [This shifts focus from the social
condition of whiteness and emphasis on individual experiences and
unrecognized privileges to underscore the underlying institutions,
structures, and power relations that sustain whiteness and its attendant
privileges.]{.underline} **[By placing the genocidal geographies of
forced removal and slavery centrally, settler colonialism accentuates a
historicized focus on the underlying foundations of white supremacy as a
continuously unfolding set of social, economic and political processes
across the landscape]{.underline}**. Seeing white supremacy this way
allows us to relationally situate it within different historical and
geographical contexts and to examine how it changes and morphs through
time and space. [We believe geographers have much to offer broader
treatments of settler colonialism and understandings of white supremacy.
Antiracist geographic scholarship can not only problematize settler
colonialism, it can also illustrate the ways in which the discipline
itself has been complicit with white supremacist settler
projects.]{.underline} [Calling attention to the intertwined logics of
settler colonialism and white supremacy not only foregrounds analysis of
race, but broadens geographic engagements with race beyond the
black/white binary that dominates much of the literature on race and
racism within Anglogeographic scholarship.]{.underline} As such, efforts
to centralize race within the discipline must consolidate analysis of
ongoing processes of colonization in settler nation-states. [Geography,
in particular, is well positioned to explore how land use practices and
histories connect to the legacies and permanence of these structures and
to the development of new understandings of the ways in which genocide,
land appropriation, and labor exploitation are tied to white supremacy
and other structures of oppression.]{.underline} As a discipline we have
much to offer in illustrating the materiality of racism and the uneven
geographies of the ill-gotten wealth of colonialism. [The effort to
contextual settler societies necessarily pushes us beyond a focus on
white privilege and instead places emphasis on the white supremacist
foundations of the socio-spatial dialectic and the unfolding of space
and place across settler colonial nations.]{.underline}

On the other hand, Barkawi and Laffey are emphatic in their demand that
a 'contrapuntal analysis' of 'events, developments and processes in core
and periphery together' be undertaken in security studies.135 They
insist that '[making sense of security relations requires putting the
weak and the strong in a common analytic framework']{.underline}
[instead of discrete categories of weak and strong
states]{.underline}.136 **[They question]{.underline}** 'the politics of
**[conventional security studies' that assumes that 'the

other great powers and their clients **[\... have the right to bear
arms']{.underline}**.137 [In the face of such 'profound
inequalities']{.underline}, [they insist that it is 'only to be
expected' that 'the "natives" have the right to bear arms]{.underline}
for purposes of their own liberatory projects, even those we profoundly
disagree with'.138 This position is further defended by their argument
that [their point 'is not to make definitive normative judgements
concerning the relative merits of these efforts]{.underline}. Rather,
**[the purpose is to draw out the political implications of our critique
of Eurocentrism in security studies]{.underline}**'.139 While the need
for a contrapuntal analysis of practices of arms control and disarmament
is desirable, the emphasis on a tit-for-tat approach with regard to
acquisition and use of weapons will fail to address the menace of
weapons. This approach smacks of a dearth of creative thinking even as
it seeks to question and undermine the dominant assumptions that control
and regulate practices of arms control and disarmament. While Barkawi
and Laffey are driven to suggest that given the inequalities embedded in
practices of arms control and disarmament it is justified for the
nonWestern world to arm itself, Hugh [Gusterson asserts that artificial
polarized divisions]{.underline} [maintained between the nuclear haves
and have-nots are an 'unsustainable binary opposition' that cannot be
maintained]{.underline} in the long run.140 [This encourages him to even
more strongly champion the cause of disarmament]{.underline}. Gusterson
recognizes that '**[our conversations about policy]{.underline}**

**[incorporate]{.underline}** certain **[neocolonial hierarchies and

us would disown']{.underline}**.141 He is critical of the racial
undertones of these conversations and insists that in addressing these
dangers, **[efforts should be made not to 'demean the peoples of the
Third World]{.underline}**. **[Nor should they be represented in ways
that obscure both the dangers inherent in the continued maintenance of
our own nuclear arsenals and the fact that our own actions are often a
source of the instabilities we so fear in Third World
nations]{.underline}**'.142 In an effort to discard the existing
binaries, [Gusterson suggests three]{.underline} discursive [strategies

strategy of [**exclusion demands an** honest]{.underline} **[rejection

### Decolonial Demand

**The alternative is a decolonial demand, an insurrection against the
logic of elimination that drives the clearing of the land and
reproduction of violent colonial relations**\
**Verracini 16** (Lorenzo Veracini is an associate Professor in History
at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia. His
research focuses on the comparative history of colonial systems and
settler colonialism. (2016) "Afterword: a history of the settler
colonial present, Settler Colonial Studies", 6:2, 174-179, DOI:
10.1080/00048623.2015.1024304//JrH)\
A type of [possession that systematically disavows]{.underline} previous
[relationships to the land]{.underline}, the [pervasive influence of
settler colonial geographies]{.underline}, [projects of
elimination]{.underline} that target indigenous socio-reproductive
capacities, the pervasive influence of specifically [settler colonial
violent attacks against indigenous and exogenous alterities,
and]{.underline} an old/new type of [capitalist
accumulation]{.underline} that 'indigenises' colonial subjectivities:
**[this is the settler colonial present.]{.underline}** However, as they
critically analyse the settler colonial present, these papers
[also]{.underline} suggest **[ways out of the settler colonial
relation]{.underline}**. They [identify its specific
structures]{.underline}. They recommend that we [challenge notions of
possession that negate the legitimate claims of prior
owners]{.underline}, that sustain indigenous isolation, and that prevent
the social reproduction of indigenous communities. They challenge [the
ongoing power of]{.underline} typically [settler colonial narratives,
the permanence of specifically settler colonial modes of violence,
and]{.underline} ongoing [processes of accumulation by
dispossession]{.underline}. Collectively, the authors contributing to
this collection propose **[a decolonial strategy]{.underline}**. As a
way to conclude, I want to very briefly add to this strategy. The
[decolonisation of settler colonial forms should begin from the
appraisal of the settler colonial 'situation'.]{.underline} **[A
fundamental and unrelenting demand]{.underline}** that indigenous people
'go die' ultimately envisages a non-relation. Hypothetical settler
departure, however, would also constitute a non-relation. [A decolonised
post-settler colonial relation must be ongoing]{.underline}. If settler
colonialism is fundamentally characterised, to use Patrick Wolfe's
terminology and framework, by settlers that 'come to stay' and by an
unrelenting 'logic of elimination', the way out needs to turn the former
against the latter[. Settlers must renounce and denounce the logic of
elimination]{.underline}. For this they need indigenous leadership.

#### Education is inseparable from the notion of decolonial justice---dominant pedagogies repeat genocide against indigenous peoples through structural violence

**Courtney-Lawson 2013** (Summerbrook, Elon University, "The Cultural
Decline of Native Americans",
<http://www.elon.edu/e-web/academics/writing_excellence/contest/Contest%20Entry%20Courtney-Lawson%20Essay.xhtml>)

Since the arrival of the Europeans, Native Americans have struggled to
maintain ownership of their land and sacred burial grounds. American
Indian author**[, Vine Deloria]{.underline}**, Jr., author of "God is
Red", **[wrote]{.underline}** about the Aboriginal World and Christian
History. He explained that, "**[The status of]{.underline}** **[native
peoples around the globe was firmly cemented by the intervention
of]{.underline}** Christianity into the political affairs of exploration
and **[colonization]{.underline}**. **[They]{.underline}** **[were
regarded as not having ownership of their lands, but as merely existing
on them]{.underline}** at the pleasure of the Christian God who had
**[now given]{.underline}** them **[to the nations of
Europe]{.underline}**". (Deloria, 255) The Spanish, upon meeting tribes
recited their "requirement" which included the Creation and Garden of
Eden, and ending with the pope sitting on the throne in Rome. The
indigenous people were asked to surrender to Christianity and if they
did not, the Spanish said it was legal to wage war and "an act of
religious piety for the Europeans to wage war to wrest the lands from
the people. Consequently, by the time the other European nations began
to discover the Western Hemisphere, the struggle for recognition of
native legal rights had disappeared." (256-257) This article recognizes
the take over of European religion and forcing Native Americans to
practice Christianity instead of being free to practice Native American
spirituality. **[Native Americans were being deprived of their
land]{.underline}**, their rights, **[and their culture]{.underline}**.
"The United States of America was founded on the principle of religious
freedom, yet the indigenous peoples whose land was used to establish
this country were denied this freedom." (Locust, 315) **[Native American
spirituality has declined drastically due to Europeans forcefully trying
to convert Native Americans]{.underline}** to Christianity. Research
conducted by Carol Locust from **[the Harvard Educational Review
reported, "American Indians were not granted religious freedom until
1978]{.underline}**, when Congress passed the American Indian Religious
Freedom Act." (316). **[This proves]{.underline}** that **[even
after]{.underline}** the passing **[the Bill of Rights and the banning
of slavery, it]{.underline}** still **[took]{.underline}** over **[two
hundred years for Native American to be granted religious
freedom]{.underline}**. **[On the other hand]{.underline}**, this
"cannot bring change quickly after decades of discrimination; **[racist
attitudes toward traditional Indian religions still
exist]{.underline}**." (316) In addition, even though religious freedom
became law in 1978, religious freedom and religious customs still have
been denied. In 2003, the North Carolina Prison system denied Dayle
Rousey, death row inmate, a traditional spiritual advisor, ceremony, and
his medicine bag. A Baptist minister was assigned to Rousey. The Baptist
minister commented, "Dayle was void of any spirituality, but he (the
minister) was sure he could convert him (Rousey) when he got to the
death chamber." (Cooper, 12). Dayle Rousey's wife was informed that if
she brought his medicine bag to the death chamber, she would not be
granted permission to have his final moments with him. There is no
program for those facing execution who seek to maintain their
traditional ceremonies. Outside of death row, the general population,
are not given an opportunity to worship as well. They are only allowed
to receive a minimum amount of traditional articles---a feather, a few
headbands, and pipe that can only be purchased. Even if this were not
insult enough, these items must be purchased only through an approved
vendor by the state. (12) These material items are not the basics of
traditional spirituality. **[It is depressing to think]{.underline}**
that **[the dominant culture feels that Native American spirituality can
be shaved down to the possession of]{.underline}** just a few
**[material articles]{.underline}**. Professor, and scholars, Theda
Perdue and Michael Green state, "The United States insisted that the
right of conquest doctrine, which had required England to surrender its
claims to the United States, also applied to the tribes. **[By this
reasoning, the tribes had no rights to the land]{.underline}** and could
expect to receive no compensation for the county they had to
relinquish." (Perdue, 22-23) In addition, Patrick Minges from the
American Indian Quarterly stated that, "Even into the nineteenth
century, **[the Cherokees were noted for their cultural
accommodation]{.underline}**. Only years later, **[following
the]{.underline}** **[introduction of Christian
traditions]{.underline}** and the ideology of race as a component within
human interactions, would **[a Cherokee myth of multiple origins and
racial hierarchy be developed]{.underline}**." (Minges, 456) **[Due
to]{.underline}** the influence of Christianity and **[the government
forcing Native Americans to live on reservations, cultural expansion has
been restricted]{.underline}** and limited. In several situations,
**[school systems have deprived Native Americans of their
culture]{.underline}** and forbidden to speak their own language.
"Discrimination against persons because of their beliefs is the most
insidious kind of injustice; Ridicule of one's spiritual beliefs or
cultural teachings wounds the spirit, leaving anger and hurt that may be
masked by a proud silence. **[American Indians\*
experience]{.underline}** this **[discrimination in abundance for the
sake of their traditional beliefs]{.underline}**, especially when such
beliefs conflict with those of the dominate culture's educational
systems."(Locust, 315**[) The Education for All Handicapped Children Act
of 1975 created a negative label for]{.underline}** some **[Native
American children]{.underline}**. "It caused multitudes of children
**[to be labeled mentally retarded]{.underline}** or learning disabled
**[who up]{.underline}** until that time **[were not considered
handicapped in their own cultures]{.underline}**." (Locust, 326)
**[Psychological evaluation tests]{.underline}** **[have been viewed as
bias because the process does little to accommodate Native American
language]{.underline}** or "cognition styles" of other cultures. (326)
**[Another issue]{.underline}** that has been disregarded in the school
systems **[is]{.underline}** traditional Native American ceremonies.
Locust goes on to say, "**[School calendars include holidays based on
Christian tradition]{.underline}** and on national historical events. In
most school systems, American Indian children do not enjoy religious
freedom, but are penalized for being absent from classes while
participating in traditional tribal ceremonies." (327) In some
situations, **[Native American students would have to suffer humiliation
by the teachers to make up for their absences]{.underline}**. In
addition, **[Native American students have been restricted in the past
to participation in academics, clubs, and athletics.]{.underline}**
**["Indian students may not participate in group sports that require
uniforms]{.underline}** or equipment that they must purchase, **[for the
school's money spent on those things means that someone else must go
without]{.underline}**." (328) Locust provides a strong statement, "We
remain positive that, once understanding has been established between
tribal cultures and educational systems, discrimination will cease."
(329) Even in today's society these rash actions impact the progression
and teaching of Native American culture. **[Discrimination towards
Native Americans reaches further back into American
history]{.underline}**. **[In times of war, Native American soldiers
were not considered equal to white soldiers.]{.underline}** During the
Civil War, as white soldiers began to die by the thousands, the military
began to accept Native Americans. Ely Parker, a Seneca Indian, became an
aide to Ulysses S. Grant. Parker was ordered by Grant to draw up the
articles of surrender for Robert E. Lee. At the surrender at Appomattox,
Lee remarked, "I am glad to see one real American here," to which Parker
replied, "We are all Americans, Sir." (Sutton and Latschar, 19) After
the Civil War, the North discarded Parker's brilliance and he died
penniless. Ely Parker was discriminated against by the North because he
was Native American. Parker stated, "I have little or no faith in the
American Christian civilization methods of healing the Indians of this
country. It has not been honest, pure or sincere. Black deception,
damnable frauds and persistent oppression has been its characteristics,
and its religion today is that the only good Indian is a dead one." (19)
The affiliation between Americans and Ely Parker (Native American)
demonstrated the manipulation used for the selfishness of the Americans.
Consequently, another innocent Native American life was lost. Following
the Civil War, atrocities towards Native Americans continued. The Sand
Creek Massacre in 1864 was one of the most brutal events for Native
Americans. Colonel Chivington and 700 troops slaughtered over 500
Cheyenne and Arapahos who believed they were under the protection of the
US Army. The majority of the dead were women, children, and elderly.
(132) Many of the Cheyenne in the camp came out waving American flags,
yelling, "don't shoot", but they were killed. The wife of Chief Black
Kettle was shot nine times. Many of the survivors dragged themselves
fifty miles over frozen ground to reach safety. (154-155) It was noted
that, "By the time Lee surrendered to Grant, the groundwork for the
final military defeat of American Indian nations had largely been laid."
(181) It can be concluded, if this group of people had been the "same"
as the Europeans, tragic events such as The Sand Creek Massacre would
not have even occurred. The United Methodist Church finally acknowledged
their role in the Massacre (Chivington was a Methodist minister), in
1996 and as the 150th anniversary of the Massacre approaches the church
is focusing on making amends to the Native people by making financial
contributions towards the tribes. (Bloom, 1) **[The notion of white
dominance continued and was displayed in horrible context during the
rounding up of the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek, and Seminole
tribes, forcing them on the Trail of Tears]{.underline}** in 1838. **[A
direct account came from a Cherokee widow named Ooloocha. "The soldiers
came and took us from home. They first surrounded our house and they
took the mare]{.underline}** while we were at work in the fields
**[and]{.underline}** they **[drove us out of doors]{.underline}** and
did not permit us to take anything with us not even a second change of
clothes, only the clothes we had on, and they shut the doors after they
turned us out." (Perdue, 124) **[White ascendancy was sustained during
the round up of the Cherokee. "A deaf man failed to respond to the
soldiers' commands, and they shot him dead]{.underline}**. Greedy whites
often witnessed these scenes because they had flocked to the Cherokee
Nation 'to seize whatever property they could put their hands.'" (125)
**[The Cherokee widow and the deaf man are prime examples of how Native
Americans have been discriminated against]{.underline}** and abused.
Professor and author, **[Henry Shapiro, explains]{.underline}** the
mindset and behavior of **[the European settler]{.underline}**. Many of
them lived on tiny plots of land in Europe or Great Britain, where they
barely eked out an existence. Others had never owned land. They lived at
the mercy of huge landowners. Upon their arrival to the new world,
"vacant" land was everywhere. The new arrivals **[assumed that since it
was not being occupied by the Indians, it was not being used. They had
no concept of stewardship of lands]{.underline}** or maintaining a
balance in hunting grounds. **[They also had no intention of keeping
treaties]{.underline}** or agreements. (Shapiro 42-55) Historian James
C. Klotter states that in Kentucky, "From the first pioneer settlement
in 1774 to statehood in 1892, white and red men battled over the hunting
grounds..." (Klotter, 291) **[The discovery of oil on Indian
Reservations has once again created explosive situations endangering the
land and Native Americans]{.underline}**. The **[oil companies are
releasing waste water onto tribal land.]{.underline}** **[Duke
University environmental scientist, Robert Jackson,
stated]{.underline}** he was very surprised that this was allowed
because **[we should know better from previous experience]{.underline}**
(Shogren,2) In addition, non-Indians are moving onto Reservation land to
work the oil fields. **[The rise in violence has escalated and tribal
officers are]{.underline}** often **[powerless to stop
it.]{.underline}** Freelance journalist, **[Sierra Crane-Murdoch
reports, "In 1978 the Supreme Court case Oliphant v.
Suquamish]{.underline}** stripped tribes of the right to arrest and
prosecute non-Indians who commit crimes on Indian land." (2)
**[Prosecuting crimes committed in Indian country is extremely
difficult]{.underline}**. "In 2011, **[the U.S. Justice Department did
not prosecute 65 percent of rape cases reported on
reservations]{.underline}**. According to department records, **[one in
three Native American women are raped during their
lifetimes-two-and-a-half times the likelihood for an average American
woman-and in 86 percent of these cases, the assailant is
non-Indian]{.underline}**." (2-3) In April 2012, the Senate added a new
provision to the Violence Against Women Act, which was first passed in
1994. This would allow tribal courts to prosecute non-Indians who
sexually assaulted tribal members on Indian Land. Unfortunately the bill
has stalled and set on a back shelf since House Republicans opposed the
measure as "a dangerous expansion of tribal independence."
(Crane-Murdoch, 3) The movement of non-Indians onto reservations
continues, as greedy corporate America drills for oil. Sadie Young Bird,
director of the Fort Berthold Coalition Against Violence shared, "When
the oil boom's over, what's it going to be like here? My staff talks
about this a lot because we all want to know. They're not going to take
their trailers with them. It'll just be deserted, with a lot of broken
people." (7) **[Since the arrival of Europeans, Native American people
suffered a great loss overall from the exposure of
diseases]{.underline}** that was **[carried]{.underline}** over **[from
Europe]{.underline}**. They had never been **[exposed to measles or
small pox. The impact of these diseases devastated tribes, wiping some
out entirely]{.underline}**. During the trade process, Europeans acted
maliciously by trading blankets that had been infected with small pox to
unsuspecting Indians. Scholar, Ann Ramenofsky noted that, disease
contact in the Americas has had its cultural consequences (Ramenofsky,
242) Similarly, the Pacific Coast people were forced from their
ancestral lands to a reservation by the government, after their tribe
was significantly reduced from epidemics. (Ruby, 185) As a result of
disease and related deaths, **[tribes have become extinct and a
considerable amount of Native American culture has been lost
forever.]{.underline}** Despite **[the recent emphasis on health care,
the "health status disparities for]{.underline}** many racial and ethnic
minorities is not new in the U.S., especially among America's **[Native
American population]{.underline}**." (Grossm an, 579) Discrimination
towards Native Americans has seeped into professional football and is
currently being brought to the forefront. **[The Washington
Redskins]{.underline}**, named in 1932, **[has a legacy and history
rooted in racism and discrimination including the name of the
team]{.underline}**. Thirty years after the race-based name was
selected, the owner of the Redskins was forced to hire its first black
football player in 1962, the last NFL team to do so. Dictionaries
describe Redskin as offensive, taboo, disparaging, and to avoid using
the word in public usage. President Barack Obama said, "I have to say
that if I were the owner of the team and I knew that there was a name of
my team---even if it had a storied history---that was offending a
sizable group of people, I'd think about changing it." (Newell) Attorney
Gyasi Ross, a member of the Blackfeet Indian Nation asked, "**[Would it
be acceptable to name a professional sports team according to the color
of someone else's skin?]{.underline}** Would it ever be cool to have a
sports team called the Washington Blackskins...San Francisco
Yellowskins?" Ross goes on to explain, that **[the term Redskin predates
the current conversation dating back to when white bounty hunters were
paid for scalps only when they provided proof by showing the
redskin]{.underline}**." (Ross) Owners and fans of the Redskins have
consistently maintained that Native Americans should be proud that the
team is honoring them. Ross states that this debate is frustrating. He
shares, "We Native people, the folks who are the only meaningful
stakeholders in this debate---are not allowed to have a voice in the
matter. Correct that: We can have an opinion so long as it is
pro-Redskin. Otherwise, we're being 'too sensitive.'" (Ross) This
on-going controversy has created an impact for some Native Americans
because of the lack of interest for others to understand. Until
recently, the majority of books written, research conducted, directors
appointed to Native American museums, and university courses relating to
Indian studies, have been conducted by whites. Native Americans are
gradually filling these much-needed spaces. **[It is imperative that
Native American children are encouraged to further their
education.]{.underline}** For instance, the State of North Carolina has
the largest population of Native Americans east of the Mississippi
(122,000; eight state recognized tribes and one federally recognized
tribe). **[However, it wasn't until the 1970s that the first Native
American became a lawyer after graduating from UNC-Chapel
Hill]{.underline}**. **[A question no one is asking is how do we recruit
Native Americans to become active citizens in politics,
education]{.underline}**, and diplomatic careers, medical **[and legal
fields?]{.underline}** I predict that **[in the next two generations,
tribes such as the Eastern Band of the Cherokee will cease to
exist.]{.underline}** **[There are few jobs available in or near the
reservations. Tribes are moving away from what is left of the remnants
of Native culture in order to find]{.underline}** jobs and
**[better]{.underline}** their **[lives.]{.underline}** It is important
that today's Americans know about their fellow Native American citizens.
**[History does repeat itself]{.underline}**, therefore, **[it is
important that Americans understand the horrible actions taken towards
Native Americans in order for Americans to respond to future events and
challenges.]{.underline}**

#### Settler identity is reconstituted through moves to innocence that distance us from guilt without having to change much at all

**Tuck and Yang, 12** -- PhD in Urban Education, Assistant Professor of
Educational Foundations, and Coordinator of Native American Studies at
the State University of New York AND Assistant Professor of Ethnic
Studies (Eve and K.W., "Decolonization is not a metaphor Eve Tuck,"
Decolonization: Indigeneity, Education & Society, Vol. 1, No. 1, 2012,
pp. 1-40)

[We observe]{.underline} that another component of a desire to play
Indian is [a settler desire to be **made innocent**, to find some
**mercy or relief** in face of the **relentlessness of settler guilt and
haunting**]{.underline} (see Tuck and Ree, forthcoming, on mercy and
haunting). Directly and [indirectly benefitting from the erasure and
assimilation of Indigenous peoples is a **difficult reality** for
settlers to accept]{.underline}. [The weight of this reality is
uncomfortable; the misery of guilt makes one hurry toward any
reprieve]{.underline}. In her 1998 Master's thesis, Janet Mawhinney
analyzed the ways in which white people maintained and (re)produced
white privilege in self-defined anti-racist settings and organizations.8
She examined the role of storytelling and self-confession - which serves
to equate stories of personal exclusion with stories of structural
racism and exclusion - and what she terms 'moves to innocence,' or
"strategies to remove involvement in and culpability for systems of
domination" (p. 17). Mawhinney builds upon Mary Louise Fellows and
Sherene Razack's (1998) conceptualization of, 'the race to innocence',
"the process through which a woman comes to believe her own claim of
subordination is the most urgent, and that she is unimplicated in the
subordination of other women" (p. 335). Mawhinney's thesis theorizes
[the self-positioning of white people]{.underline} as simultaneously the
oppressed and never an oppressor, and [as having an absence of
experience of oppressive power relations]{.underline} (p. 100). This
simultaneous self-positioning afforded white people in various
purportedly anti-racist settings to say to people of color, ["I don't
experience the problems you do, so I don't think about it,"]{.underline}
and "tell me what to do, you're the experts here" (p. 103). ["The
**commonsense appeal** of such statements,"]{.underline} Malwhinney
observes, enables white speakers to "utter them sanguine in \[their\]
appearance of equanimity, [is rooted in the **normalization of a liberal
analysis of power relations**"]{.underline} (ibid.). In the discussion
that follows, [we will do]{.underline} some [work to identify and argue
against]{.underline} a series of what we call '[settler moves to
innocence']{.underline}. [Settler moves to innocence are]{.underline}
those [strategies or positionings that attempt to **relieve the
settler** of]{.underline} feelings of [guilt or responsibility without
giving up land or power or privilege, **without having to change much at
all**]{.underline}. In fact, settler scholars may gain professional
kudos or a boost in their reputations for being so sensitive or
self-aware. Yet [settler moves to innocence are hollow, they only serve
the settler. This discussion will likely cause discomfort]{.underline}
in our settler readers, [may]{.underline} embarrass you/us or [make
us/you feel implicated.]{.underline} Because of the racialized flights
and flows of settler colonial empire described above, settlers are
diverse - there are white settlers and brown settlers, and peoples in
both groups make moves to innocence that attempt to deny and deflect
their own complicity in settler colonialism. When it makes sense to do
so, we attend to moves to innocence enacted differently by white people
and by brown and Black people. In describing settler moves to innocence,
our goal is to provide a framework of excuses, distractions, and
diversions from decolonization. We discuss some of the moves to
innocence at greater length than others, mostly because some require
less explanation and because others are more central to our initial
argument for the demetaphorization of decolonization. [We provide this
framework so that we can be more impatient with each other, less likely
to accept gestures and half-steps, and more willing to press for acts
which **unsettle innocence**]{.underline}, which we discuss in the final
section of this article.

### Elimination

#### The impact is racialized targeting and extermination -- settler colonialism separates Natives into zones of legality and zones of death in order to justify free and ruthless use of force until Natives are appropriated into the Sovereign's culture nativity is erased

As Jesse Carr shows in detail in this volume, writing of the
contemporary legacies of frontier violence, [state-sanctioned law and
vigilante violence are intimately intertwined throughout US
history]{.underline}: [**settler colonial violence is at once
law-making, and therefore constitutive of a certain kind of sovereignty,
and a 'free and ruthless' use of force**. It at once obeys and
constitutes]{.underline} over and again [the line that demarcates the
appropriation of land and resources]{.underline} [and the division
between those protected by law and sovereignty and those subject to
their violence.]{.underline} The corollary to **[this perpetual
reconstitution of law-making violence]{.underline}**, which does not
allow the 'forgetting' of the law's origins in appropriation, **[is the
persistence of a psychic 'state of siege']{.underline}**: **[the
representation of the world as a surround populated by uncivil peoples
who pose what]{.underline}**, **[in the language of
neoconservatism]{.underline}** as of Zionism, **[is understood as an
'existential threat' to civil subjects.]{.underline}** With the
impeccable logic of the paranoid, [the 'free and ruthless force'
inflicted on those evicted]{.underline} 'beyond the line' is projected
onto its objects. [This leads]{.underline}, as Nadera Shalhoub-Kevorkian
shows in her essay, [to the constitution of 'death zones' inhabited by
beings whom the settler colonial state considers]{.underline}, from
before their births to even after their deaths, [as existential and
demographic threats]{.underline}. In the final pages of The Nomos of the
Earth, Schmitt asks a question still pertinent to the current moment of
globalization: 'Has humanity today actually "appropriated" the earth as
a unity, so that there is nothing more to be appropriated? Has
appropriation really ceased?' 20 It is clear, following Harvey, that
**[appropriation has not ceased]{.underline}**, but it is equally clear
that [the fundamental act of demarcation, the distributions of legality
and ruthless force which constitute a nomos]{.underline}, **[continues
in new forms,]{.underline}** constituting new frontiers appropriate to
the emergent mode of accumulation on a global scale. See reminds us of
Rosa Luxemburg's argument that capitalism 'needs other races': for her,
those 'races' were the 'outside' of capital, 'beyond the line', in
Schmitt's terms. Now, [at a moment when the globe has been appropriated
'as a unity]{.underline}', [the current crisis of capital may find no
geographical 'outside']{.underline} any more, **[but is no less
productive]{.underline}** **[of forms of racialization that continue to
correspond to nomothetic demarcations]{.underline}** but within an
utterly different spatial ordering wherein, in Weizman's phrase, 'the
periphery comes straight to the center'. Within this new spatial
ordering, Weizman suggests, '[acts of spatial exclusion]{.underline}
creat\[e\] [wedges that separate the habitat of a population marked as a
political "outside" and perceived as a political threat'.]{.underline}
21 **[Such 'wedges' result in a quite different mapping of the spatial
order of domination]{.underline}** that was designated by lines of
longitude, a mapping with which any contemporary urban dweller is
already intimate: **[The]{.underline}** contemporary **[city is
exploding spatially]{.underline}**, **[but]{.underline}** in essence
**[is]{.underline}** **[fractalized into a collection of]{.underline}**
interlocking, internally homogeneous, and externally
**[alienating]{.underline}** synthetic **[environments]{.underline}**.
**[The separation between the affluent, established
populations]{.underline}** **[from \[sic\] the]{.underline}** **[poorer
immigrant populations can no longer be understood as a continuous line
across the map]{.underline}**. Internal city borders will be further 114
D. Lloyd and P. Wolfe reinforced, forming local enclaves scattered
across the city and its suburbs. Point based security systems fractalize
borders and turn them from a defined object into a condition of
heightened security whose presence is manifested in electronic or
physical barriers at entry points to office buildings, shopping malls,
or transport infrastructure -- from midtown to suburbia.22 **[The
laboratories]{.underline}** **[for]{.underline}** both **[this
'condition of heightened security']{.underline}**, including the
necessary surveillance technologies, and for the reorganization of
social space **[have been and continue to be the sites of colonial
counter-insurgency]{.underline}**, from Northern Ireland to Palestine.23
**[Settler colonialism]{.underline}**, specifically under conditions of
what Israeli sociologist Baruch Kimmerling called 'low frontierity', 24
**[furnished]{.underline}** both **[the model by which
populations]{.underline}** and spaces **[are distributed between zones
of legality and,]{.underline}** in Shalhoub-Kevorkian's phrase,
'**[zones of death']{.underline}**, and the historically normalized
imaginary of the perpetual 'state of siege'. The counter-insurgency
campaigns of Israel and Northern Ireland stand as some reminder that
[the settler colony has always also been a site of military
occupation]{.underline} and -- as See also points out --
[is]{.underline} extended extraterritorially [by way of military
occupation]{.underline} as [a further modality of
colonialism.]{.underline} The settler colonial and the military
imaginaries intertwine with great and familiar intimacy, from the
stockades of the early colonists and forts of the frontier cavalry to
the hilltop Israeli settlements in Palestine that double as military
outposts, to the current military intervention into Aboriginal
communities in Australia's Northern Territory, or to the fortified
police stations of Soweto or Belfast. But [military
occupation]{.underline}, which Klein identifies as one model of the new
modes of social control and spatial organization of neoliberal states,
[does]{.underline} also [offer an alternative if intersecting model for
colonial domination]{.underline}. The military occupation of the
Philippines entailed neither extensive Euro-American settlement nor
incorporation into the state, though particularly in the Philippines the
genocidal prosecution of the war from 1898 to 1913 explicitly learnt
much from the recently completed frontier wars against Native
Americans.25 Rather, **[they offer paradigms for the kinds of colonial
domination that operate through partial and segmented
land-appropriation]{.underline}**, **[secured through ruthless violence
but maintained through the forced]{.underline}** ('benevolent')
**[pacification of the surviving population]{.underline}**. In this
respect, **[occupation combined with tutelage functions as an early
instance of the nomothetic lines of legal or moral demarcation that
characterize for the most part the framework of the neoliberal state and
its racial order.]{.underline}**

#### Settler Colonial projects create a process of double-elimination that not only removes the Native from their land, but destroys cultural ways of being before the arrival of the colonizer -- attempting an absolute destruction of Native life.

**Svirsky and Ben-Arie 19** Marcelo Svirsky & Ronnen Ben-Arie (2019)
Settler Colonialism and the Logic of Double Elimination, Interventions,
21:4, 464-485, DOI: 10.1080/1369801X.2018.1558101, /MegLak

In the Zionist settler colonial project, the notion of "frontier"
materialized not just via the expansion of physical boundaries of the
territorial Jewish enclaves. Rather, **[in Zionist settler colonial
expansion, land was just one realm of action]{.underline}**. Zionist
[conquest during the first decades of the project was based on the
race-motivated invention of frontiers, and frontiers were created
literally everywhere]{.underline}. In racializing workers, their tools
and skills, Jewish [settlers created frontiers in the labour market,
making the conquest of labour a horizon of expansion]{.underline}.
Domestic [consumption was another such new frontier, where from whom one
purchases bread, cigarettes, flour, meat, and other products had
national significance]{.underline}. [By following the axiom]{.underline}
that Jews buy only from Jews who have produced their goods on the basis
of Hebrew labour only, [one was contributing to a double movement: to
**strengthen the Jewish economy meant to weaken the Arab
one**]{.underline}. One existential territory arises on the dwindling of
another; [one life for another. In]{.underline} the
[manufacturing]{.underline} of [segregated enclaves Zionism invented
frontiers, hence it could expand by conquering social spheres, by
racializing life within them]{.underline}, and by bringing them into
reciprocal resonance. [In]{.underline} the case of
[Palestine]{.underline}, territorial **[conquest was dependent on
settler colonial social expansion]{.underline}**. It is worth
remembering that by 1947 the Yishuv held only about 7 percent of the
total land area of Palestine (national and private holdings), while by
early 1949, with the signing of the Armistice Agreements with Egypt,
Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria, Israel found itself dominating 77 percent of
Palestine. This dramatic change ensued in the course of the 1947--49
war. [The competence, strength, and hunger to conquer territories beyond
the lines of the 1947 UN Partition resolution -- these attributes were
the product of a long process of frontier expansion in the social realm,
as discussed earlier]{.underline}. That is, the figure of 7 percent
might be misleading. Within the pre-1948 7 percent of land, a fully
functioning society was developed and equipped as a state. [Its
territorial expansion was predicated on its institutional aptitudes, its
internal cohesiveness, its ability to recruit, no less than on its
determination and sense of entitlement. Social frontiers]{.underline},
not concrete walls and fences, [were the first major cultural industry
of the Zionist movement.]{.underline} Confronting the field of
indigeneity, early Zionism found itself working on more than one front.
In their resistance, natives -- Arabs and Jews -- found themselves
striving to maintain their ways of life. [The engineering of racial
Jewish enclaves meant that not only the Arab natives **could not
reproduce their ways of life as in the past**, nor could Arabs and
Oriental Jews continue their shared everyday practices]{.underline}. A
shared cultural milieu formed through cen- turies bonded Arabs and
Oriental Jews -- a milieu that threatened the Zionist immigrant with an
invitation to share a social space. However, [in the eyes of the
Ashkenazi pioneers, the source of this commonality was the reason to
repudiate it]{.underline}. In this negation, [Arab--Jewish shared life
became a form of resist- ance, a contestation of the attempt --
eventually successful -- **to disrupt the local identity shared by Arabs
and Jews**. Two]{.underline} interrelated [movements were taking
place]{.underline}, both **[taking a toll on native life]{.underline}**.
On one level[, in the expanding segregative activities of the
settlers]{.underline}, [Arabs]{.underline} [saw]{.underline} their
power[, sense of ownership of the land, and nativeness being
challenged]{.underline}. On another level, [the Ashkenazi Yishuv asked
to]{.underline} disempower also the Jewish Oriental millet and to [place
native Jews under a peremptory demand to join the national project on
the former's cultural and political terms]{.underline}. As part of the
process that led them to side with Zionism, particularly after the riots
of 1929, Oriental Jews were denativizing themselves politically. [In
between these struggles, **shared life was losing its historical
habitats, and struggling to create new ones**.]{.underline} Shared life
would have its swan-song on the verge of the Nakba, in the numerous
efforts to establish civil alliances that attempted to resist the
spreading of mutual violence. The dispossession and displacement of the
Arabs of Palestine became a necessary but insufficient condition in the
Zionist settler project. [Arab--Jewish shared life had to go as much as
the Arabs of Palestine had to go.]{.underline} From the viewpoint of the
present, [Arab life in Palestine has been placed under never-ending
siege and destruction by the settler colonial machines of the State of
Israel]{.underline}, and Arab-- **[Jewish shared life has been made to
disappear. Zionism is founded on a double elimination.]{.underline}**

#### Piecemeal reforms in arms trade only perpetuate the arms regulatory regime -- only a foundational shift and re-evaluation of the legitimacy of our ability to regulate arms transferring solves

**Cooper** **'18** (Neil, PhD, Professor of International Relations and
Security Studies and Head of Peace Studies & International Development

Regulation and Humanitarian Arms Control in the Age of Empire, Journal
of Global Security Studies, 10.1093/jogss/ogy013)CN

It is worth noting in this context that in historical terms, the
Brussels Act and **[the broader range of initiatives to manage arms
flows in the spaces of Empire were essentially
transitory]{.underline}**---**[they did not produce a lasting change in
arms trade norms or in the international system]{.underline}**. In part
at least, this was because prohibitory arms trade norms emerged as
elements in the normative superstructure of the era rather than as
constitutive norms in their own right. At the same time, it was also the
case that from the 1930s onwards, [changes in the substance of
transnational constitutive norms pertaining to sovereignty, security,
economy, and colonialism created the permissive conditions for a new set
of regulatory arms trade norms to emerge through new processes of
grafting]{.underline} and counter-grafting. There were, of course,
elements of earlier approaches in the use of arms supplies to "the
friendlies" in the wars of decolonization and anticommunism. More
generally, however, [arms trade regulation]{.underline} in the Cold War
[was characterized]{.underline} more [by a sovereign]{.underline}
[approach to arms control that emphasized the]{.underline} creation and
expansion of peacetime national export licensing systems and the [use of
regulation to achieve security between states]{.underline}. **[Arms
trade norms were ultimately at the mercy of these far larger shifts in
foundational constitutive norms.]{.underline}** All **[this should
prompt]{.underline}** due **[modesty on the part of the optimists
heralding the normative transformations]{.underline}** supposedly
**[wrought by HAC initiatives]{.underline}** **[such as those on small
arms.]{.underline}** **[This article also highlights the need for
a]{.underline}** more **[thoroughgoing genealogical approach to the
histories of both HAC and arms trade regulation]{.underline}**
(governmental and sovereign). This is more obviously the domain of the
critical school of thinking on arms trade regulation. In the case of the
optimists, both [the evident flaws of humanitarian arms trade regulation
in the late nineteenth century and its essentially transient nature
demonstrate why they need to think more historically about the
relationship between humanitarianism and arms regulation.]{.underline}
Indeed, despite the differences between nineteenth- and
twenty-first-century HAC, **[they have yet to convincingly demonstrate
why things might turn out differently this time around.]{.underline}**

#### The perm solves -- legal pluralist actions to accommodate Indigenous issues are able to create pragmatic and lasting change -complete disavowal of the state and human rights approaches dooms movements and prevents a diversity of tactics

Rights, Indigenous Peoples, and the Pursuit of Justice", 34 Yale L. &

As Abraham Maslow famously stated, "it is tempting, if the only tool you
have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail."180 In this
Article, [we have put forward the argument that the rights-based
approach---the hammer, as it were---contains certain structural biases
that can affect its operation in situations concerning]{.underline}
minority and [Indigenous justice]{.underline}. Nevertheless, this is not
to say that **[there are]{.underline}** not **[some occasions that
specifically call for a hammer]{.underline}**: indeed, even within the
CLS movements there have been voices cautioning against throwing the
baby out with the rights-skepticism bathwater, notably from the Critical
Race Theory camp. A number of CRT scholars have maintained that [legal
rights are still an important tool for minority groups, even in light of
their evident shortcomings]{.underline} and the tendency for such
purportedly universal entitlements to preserve the interests of the
privileged.181 This Article does not adopt a wholly rights-skeptical
position. On the contrary[, we recognize that **in certain situations
the interests of Indigenous justice are best served by a rights-based
approach**, and we offered the Violence Against Women Act of 2013 as a
paradigmatic example of such a success story]{.underline}, although it
does urge caution in terms of the apparent myopia engendered by the
dominance of the rights paradigm. While **[Indigenous peoples
should]{.underline}** of course **[take advantage of every tool in the
toolbox in order to achieve the aim of justice]{.underline}**, not every
situation warrants articulation in the language of rights. This is so
regardless of whether it is better dealt with outside of the legal
system, such as with racist sports franchise names and mascots, like
those of the Washington Redskins, where a program of public education is
likely to bring more satisfactory and longer-lasting results than one of
litigation; whether because a rights-based approach forces the issue's
articula- tion in terms or within parameters that cause its distortion;
or whether the very adoption of such an approach locks the rights
claimants into a form of interaction that accords to a logic that is
essentially "other." Importantly, therefore, **[we are not arguing in
favor of either a complete loss of faith in the potential of
rights-based approaches to achieve justice for Indigenous
people]{.underline}**/s or a complete cessation of any and all recourse
to the rhetoric, for a, and power of rights. Instead, we recommend
acknowledgment that: first, there is no truth to the idea that rights
(or law) are intrinsically a vehicle of social justice; second, rights
discourse is not a neutral one but rather comes with its own baggage;
and, third, that reliance on rights discourse is a choice that ought to
be made on a case-by-case basis. [It is vital, therefore, that in each
situa- tion such a choice occurs in the full awareness not only that it
is a choice but that it ought to be selected on particular grounds and
for particular reasons, namely the suitability of its underpinning logic
and processes.]{.underline}

Even When They Are Dangerous [Everywhere land resists]{.underline} and

Indigenous people continu to **subvert legal and capitalist technologies
as part of that resistance**. And technologies and technological beings
resist too.]{.underline} [Patent law is patently designed to favor
corporations,]{.underline} a legal technology whose colonizing functions
are particularly evident when considering how [Monsanto and other GMO
producing giants are patenting seeds and genes they "find" throughout
the world.]{.underline} Yet [Indigenous communities are fighting this
biopiracy by refusing the systems that permit corporations to patent

first place, by creating digital libraries of traditional knowledges,
and sometimes **[by subverting patent law to claim rights to their own
life worlds and knowledges]{.underline}**.\[35\] [Treaties are
technologies of colonial coercion and yet **also of Indigenous

. And yet [there is **always the possibility** of slippage,
indeterminacy, unforeseen consequences, or unintended results; it is
always possible]{.underline}, that is, [that an x-mark could result in
something good]{.underline}. Why else, we must ask, would someone bother
to make it?"\[36\] Since 1948, [the Oneida Indian Nation has pursued
restoration of sovereignty]{.underline} over historical reservation
lands [via]{.underline} a complex set of avenues involving [treaty
law]{.underline}, U.S. [courts, casinos, and excise taxes, resulting in
a landmark **13,004 acres of land taken into trust**]{.underline} by the
Department of the Interior in 2014.\[37\] Sometimes [settlers return
land to Indigenous tribes and nations]{.underline}. Hopefully, they/we
might do so without conditions. As I write, [the Kashia Band of Pomo
Indians are getting back 688 acres of coastal lands]{.underline} in
California.\[38\] I am not saying wealthy settlers who return land are
decolonizing. I am saying that some **[colonizing technology has been
hotwired]{.underline}**; something scyborg is happening.
[The]{.underline} truth is that any [return of land]{.underline} is not
just due to the good graces and benevolence of wealthy settlers; it [is
a scyborg possibility foretold by an x-mark]{.underline}. About
Hollywood star Johnny Depp's purported promise to buy land for Comanche,
Sonny Skyhawk, a Sicangu Lakota actor and founder of American Indians in
Film and Television, said, "If it's from the heart, we accept it. If
it's not from the heart, we'll accept it anyways."\[39\] Developed as
weapons of surveillance and assassination, drones are hard to imagine as
decolonizing instruments; yet these machines we hate may serve a
function before we discard them. Originally a wind-powered device
similar to the childhood wind toys of its Afghani creator Massoud
Hassani, the Mine Kafon drone "can autonomously map, detect, and
detonate land mines" and could contribute to demilitarizing mine-filled
lands within a generation.\[40\] Dynamite, which left Alfred Nobel rich
and many dead, and which abetted in U.S. westward imperial expansion,
blew up the Elwha and Glines Canyon dams and restored the Elwha

ocean to clean herself of the great Pacific Garbage Patch.\[42\] Oysters
made "plantable" by farming technologies detoxify the Hudson and so
become too poisonous to eat, but because of them, the frogs will
return.\[43\] Wind-powered strandbeests---originally devised to restore
Dutch beaches---now roam almost autonomous, almost free.\[44\] Toxic and
explosive and wind-willed machine animals, you, scyborg, might read
about and feel some odd sense of recognition. [Figure out how

[**Rather than thinking of ourselves as just subjects of those

explosives, the toxified, the operative parts of those
technologies---and ideally, how [we might operate on]{.underline}
ourselves and other [technologies and **turn these gears into
decolonizing operations**.]{.underline} If this sounds easy and obvious,
then my writing has failed you. Listen: you will need to remember this
when you are accused of destruction. [Attach a pacemaker to the heart of

### Apocalyptic

#### Apocalyptic images challenges settler-colonialism by contesting the implausibility that inequitable structures can produce catastrophe 

Jessica **Hurley 17**, Assistant Professor in the Humanities at the
University of Chicago, "Impossible Futures: Fictions of Risk in the
Longue Durée", Duke University Press,
https://read.dukeupress.edu/american-literature/article/89/4/761/132823/Impossible-Futures-Fictions-of-Risk-in-the-Longue

If contemporary ecocriticism has a shared premise about environmental
risk it is that genre is the key to both perceiving and, possibly,
correcting ecological crisis. Frederick Buell's 2003 From Apocalypse to
Way of Life: Environmental Crisis in the American Century has
established one of the most central oppositions of this paradigm. As his
title suggests, Buell tells the story of a discourse that began in the
apocalyptic mode in the 1960s and 70s, when discussions of "the immanent
end of nature" most commonly took the form of "prophecy, revelation,
climax, and extermination" before turning away from apocalypse when the
prophesied ends failed to arrive (112, 78). [Buell offers his suggestion
for the appropriate literary mode for life lived within a crisis that is
both unceasing and inescapable: new voices, "if wise enough....will
abandon apocalypse for a sadder realism that]{.underline} looks closely
at social and environmental changes in process and [recognizes crisis as
a place where people dwell]{.underline}" (202-3). In a world of threat,
Buell demands a realism that might help us see risks more clearly and
aid our survival.¶ Buell's argument has become a broadly held view in
contemporary risk theory and ecocriticism, overlapping fields in the
social sciences and humanities that address the foundational question of
second modernity: "how do you live when you are at such risk?" (Woodward
2009, 205).1 Such an assertion, however, assumes both that realism is a
neutral descriptive practice and that apocalypse is not something that
is happening now in places that we might not see, or cannot hear. [This
essay argues for the continuing importance of apocalyptic narrative
forms in representations of]{.underline} environmental [risk to disrupt
conservative realisms that maintain the status quo]{.underline}. Taking
the ecological disaster of nuclear waste as my case study, I examine two
fictional treatments of nuclear waste dumps that create different
temporal structures within which the colonial history of the United
States plays out. The first, a set of Department of Energy documents
that use statistical modeling and fictional description to predict a set
of realistic futures for the site of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in
New Mexico (1991), creates a present that is fully knowable and a future
that is fully predictable. Such an approach, I suggest, perpetuates the
[state logics of **implausibility**]{.underline} that [have long
undergirded settler colonialism in the United States]{.underline}. In
contrast, Leslie Marmon Silko's contemporaneous novel Almanac of the
Dead (1991) uses its [apocalyptic form]{.underline} to [deconstruct the
claims to verisimilitude that undergird state realism, transforming
nuclear waste into a prophecy of the end of the United States rather
than a means for imagining its continuation.]{.underline} In Almanac of
the Dead, the presence of nuclear waste introjects [a deep-time
perspective into contemporary America]{.underline},
[transform]{.underline}ing [the]{.underline} [present into a
**speculative space** where]{.underline} environmental [catastrophe
produces not only **unevenly distributed damage**]{.underline} [but also
revolutionary forms of social justice that insist on a truth that
probability modeling cannot contain: that the future will
be]{.underline} [**unimaginably different** from the present, while the
present, too, might yet be utterly different from the real that we think
we know]{.underline}.¶ Nuclear waste is rarely treated in ecocriticism
or risk theory, for several reasons: it is too manmade to be ecological;
its catastrophes are ongoing, intentionally produced situations rather
than sudden disasters; and it does not support the narrative that
subtends ecocritical accounts of risk perception in which the nuclear
threat gives rise to an awareness of other kinds of threat before
reaching the end of its relevance at the end of the Cold War.2 In what
follows, I argue that the failure of nuclear waste to fit into the
critical frames created by ecocriticism and risk theory to date offers
an opportunity to expand those frames and overcome some of their
limitations, especially the impulse towards a paranoid, totalizing
realism that Peter van Wyck (2005) has described as central to
ecocriticism in the risk society. Nuclear waste has durational forms
that dwarf the human. It therefore dwells less in the economy of risk as
it is currently conceptualized and more in the blown-out realm of deep
time. Inhabiting the temporal scale that has recently been christened
the Anthropocene, the geological era defined by the impact of human
activities on the world's geology and climate, nuclear waste unsettles
any attempt at realist description, unveiling the limits of human
imagination at every turn.3 By analyzing risk society through a
heuristic of nuclear waste, this essay offers a critique of nuclear
colonialism and environmental racism. At the same time, it shows how
[the apocalyptic mode]{.underline} [in deep time]{.underline} [allows
narratives of]{.underline} environmental [harm and danger to move beyond
the paranoid logic of risk. In the world of deep time]{.underline}, all
that might come to pass will come to pass, sooner or later. [The endless
maybes of risk become certainties. The impossibilities of our own deaths
and the deaths of everything else will come.]{.underline} [But so too
will other impossibilities]{.underline}: talking macaws and alien
visitors; [the end of the colonial occupation of North America, perhaps,
or a **sudden human determination** to let the world live]{.underline}.
The end of capitalism may yet become more thinkable than the end of the
world. Just wait long enough. Stranger things will happen.¶ Realism and
Risk in the Longue Durée¶ The nature of risk, as Ulrich Beck notes in
his foundational Risk Society (1986, 72), is fundamentally anti-realist;
in the risk society, "dangerous, hostile substances lie concealed behind
the harmless façades. Everything must be viewed with a double gaze, and
can only be correctly understood and judged through this doubling. The
world of the visible must be investigated, relativized and evaluated
with respect to a second reality, only existent in thought and yet
concealed in the world." The traumatic nature of living in a world of
risk, exemplified in the canonical toxic-world novels White Noise (Don
DeLillo, 1985) and Gain (Richard Powers, 1998), lies in the way that the
real world is no longer accessible to perception.4 Risks become
perceptible only when they are already no longer threats but events, a
condition that makes risk itself appear in a fundamentally literary
mode; as Susan Mizruchi (2010, 119) writes, "when improbable risks are
actualized in catastrophe, the familiar becomes the uncanny." What
Mizruchi calls the uncanny, Laurence Buell (2001) describes as the
gothic; in both cases, Beck's description of a second, real-er world
beneath the phenomenological one finds a strong descriptor and a place
in literary history as critics connect risk fiction to more established
genres that account for what we cannot perceive and cannot understand.
No longer haunted by falling helmets or animate dolls, the risk novel
tries instead to theorize the connections between tumors and the factory
that closed down two generations ago, between what we know of
bioaccumulation and what we feel when we look at a carrot.¶ [For many
critics]{.underline}, as for F. Buell, [the]{.underline} gothic [terror
of a world of risk produces apocalypticism as a symptom and realism as a
solution]{.underline}. 5 Even when apocalypse is recognized as a
potentially valuable tool for approaching risk, as in Ursula K. Heise's
insight that in a world of world-threatening danger "apocalyptic
narrative....can appropriately be understood as a form of risk
perception" (2008, 141), the potential benefit of apocalypse is as the
most realistic genre for representing a scenario that is genuinely
apocalyptic (as in the exponentially increasing flood of contemporary
apocalypse novels depicting climate change, for example).6 As Peter van
Wyck has argued, [however, the]{.underline} [realist commitment to
describing the totality of the world's relations produces its own set of
epistemic anxieties]{.underline} in a world defined by risk:
contemporary ecological [threats can come to make]{.underline}
ecological [thought itself look like a particularly advanced form of
cultural paranoia.]{.underline} I mean this in the sense that once we
say that everything is connected in this fashion, we mean that
everything is, if not already, then at least potentially integrated into
a framework of understanding. And it isn't. To make everything connected
is to see the fissures and cracks rendered by ecological
threats---whether the threats posed by wastes or the threats
retroactively discovered through accidents--- as a kind of recompense
for a failure to have properly understood the connections. The real
punishing the epistemic for its sins of omission. (ix)
[Realism]{.underline}, in van Wyck's account, [becomes visible as itself
a symptom of the paranoid mindset that the risk society tends to
produce, a mindset that insists,]{.underline} as Eve Sedgwick writes
concurrently with van Wyck, [that "there must be no bad
surprises"]{.underline} (2003, 130). In such a mode, [comfort comes not
from ameliorating the danger that produced the original discomfort, but
rather from constructing a model of the world that can give an illusion
of totality]{.underline} (ibid. 133-6). [A realist approach to
representing risk thus has **real-world consequences** in second
modernity, "blotting out any sense of the possibility of alternative
ways of understanding or things to understand"]{.underline} (131). Such
consequences can be seen nowhere more clearly than in the government
experiment with realism that goes by the unglamorous name of the Waste
Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), where the realism is that of the settler
colonial state and the alternative ways of understanding are those of
the Native nations who are most vulnerable to the site's dangers.7

### Fatalism

#### Settler colonialism's structural account shuts down ways to imagine liberatory futures - Their pessimistic ontology's Manichean binary precludes any alternative than total destruction.

Rachel **BUSBRIDGE**, Alexander von Humboldt Postdoctoral Fellow in
Institut für Islamwissenschaft (Institute of Islamic Studies), Freie
Universität Berlin, **17** \["Israel-Palestine and the Settler Colonial
'Turn': From Interpretation to Decolonization," *Theory, Culture &
Society*, First Published: January 23, 2017, p. 1-25, Accessed Online
through Emory Libraries\]

[The prescription for decolonization]{.underline} -- that is, [a
normative project committed to the liberation of the colonized and the
overturning of colonial relationships of power]{.underline} (Kohn and
McBride, 2011: 3) -- [is]{.underline} indeed [one of the most
counter-hegemonic implications of the settler colonial
paradigm]{.underline} as applied to Israel-Palestine, potentially
shifting it from a diagnostic frame to a prognostic one which offers a
'proposed solution to the problem, or at least a plan of attack'
(Benford and Snow, 2000: 616). [What, however, does the settler colonial
paradigm offer by way of envisioning decolonization?]{.underline} As
Veracini (2007) notes, while settler colonial studies scholars have
sought to address the lack of attention paid to the experiences of
indigenous peoples in conventional historiographical accounts of
decolonization (which have mostly focused on settler independence and
the loosening of ties to the 'motherland'), [there is]{.underline}
nevertheless [a 'narrative deficit' when it comes to imagining settler
decolonization]{.underline}. While Veracini (2007) relates this deficit
to a matter of conceptualization, [it is apparent that the structural
perspective of the paradigm in many ways **closes down** possibilities
of imagining the type of social and political transformation to which
the notion of decolonization aspires]{.underline}. In this regard,
[there is a worrying tendency (if not **tautological discrepancy**) in
settler colonial studies, where the only solution to settler colonialism
is decolonization -- which a faithful adherence to the paradigm
renders]{.underline} largely unachievable, if not
**[impossible]{.underline}**.

To understand why this is the case, it is necessary to return to Wolfe's
(2013a: 257) account of settler colonialism as guided by a 'zero-sum
logic whereby settler societies, for all their internal complexities,
uniformly require the elimination of Native alternatives'. [The
structuralism of this account has immense power as a means of mapping
forms of injustice]{.underline} and indignity [as well as strategies
of]{.underline} resistance and [refusal]{.underline}, and Wolfe is
careful to show how transmutations of the logic of elimination are
complex, variable, discontinuous and uneven. [Yet, in seeking to
elucidate the logic of elimination as the overarching historical force
guiding settler-native relations there is an **operational weakness** in
the theory, whereby such a logic is simply there, omnipresent and
manifest even when]{.underline} (and perhaps especially when) [it
appears not to be; the settler colonial studies scholar **need only read
it into** a situation or context. It]{.underline} thus [hurtles from the
past to the present into the future, **never to be fully extinguished**
until the native is, or until history itself ends. There is]{.underline}
thus [a powerful ontological]{.underline} (if not metaphysical)
[dimension]{.underline} to Wolfe's account, [where there is such thing
as a 'settler will' that inherently desires the elimination of the
native and the distinction between the settler and the native can only
ever be **categorical**]{.underline}, founded as it is on the 'primal
binarism of the frontier' (2013a: 258). It is here that the differences
between earlier settler colonial scholarship on Israel-Palestine and the
recent settler colonial turn come into clearest view. While Jamal
Hilal's (1976) Marxist account of the conflict, for instance, engaged
Palestinians and Jewish Israelis in terms of their relations to the
means of production, [Wolfe's account brings its own
ontology]{.underline}: the bourgeoisie/proletariat distinction becomes
[that of settler/native]{.underline}, and the class struggle [the
struggle between settler, who seeks to destroy and replace the native,
and native, who can only ever push back]{.underline}. Indeed, [if the
settler colonial paradigm views history in similar teleological terms to
the Marxist framework, it does not offer the same hopeful vision of a
liberated future. After all, settler colonialism has only one story to
tell -- 'either total victory or total failure']{.underline} (Veracini,
2007).

[Veracini's attempt to disaggregate different forms of settler
decolonization is revealing of the difficulties that come along with
this zero-sum perspective]{.underline}. It is significant to note that
[beyond settler evacuation (which may decolonize territory]{.underline},
he cautions, [but not]{.underline} necessarily [relationships) the
picture]{.underline} he paints [is]{.underline} a relatively
[bleak]{.underline} one. [For Veracini]{.underline} (2011: 5), [claims
for decolonization from indigenous peoples in settler societies can take
two broad forms: an 'anti-colonial rhetoric expressing a demand for
indigenous sovereign independence and
self-determination]{.underline} ... [and an "ultra"-colonial one that
seeks a reconstituted partnership with the \[settler state\] and
advocates a return to a relatively more respectful middle ground and
"treaty" conditions']{.underline}. While both, he suggests, are tempting
strategies in the struggle for change, though 'ultimately ineffective
against settler colonial structures of domination' (2011: 5), it is the
latter strategy that invites Veracini's most scathing assessment. As [he
writes]{.underline},

> [under settler colonial conditions the independent polity is the
> settler polity and sanctioning the equal rights of indigenous peoples
> has historically been used as a powerful weapon in the denial of
> indigenous entitlement and in the enactment of various forms of
> coercive assimilation. **This decolonisation actually enhances the
> subjection of indigenous peoples**]{.underline} ... [it is at best
> irrelevant and at worst detrimental to indigenous peoples]{.underline}
> in settler societies. (2011: 6--7)

### Alliances

#### Political alliances with the state are key to effective anti-colonial protest

[As Standing Rock has shown, indigenous nations that use their unique
standing to advocate for viable alternatives]{.underline} to unjust
systems [will gain supporters]{.underline}. Our traditional territories
encompass the rivers, mountains, and forests that capital exploits with
abandon. [Our resistance --- to the pipelines]{.underline}, bulldozers,
[and mines that cut through our lands]{.underline} and communities ---
[has greater potential than yet realized]{.underline}. Ours is a
powerful voice envisioning a more harmonious and sustainable
relationship with the natural world rooted in the resurgence of
indigenous sovereignty. [As long as indigenous people]{.underline}
continue to [make this argument, we are **positioned to win policies**,
court decisions, and international agreements that protect and enlarge
our sovereignty]{.underline} and jurisdiction. [As our
jurisdiction]{.underline} and sovereignty [grow, we will have more power
to stop, reroute, and **transform carbon-based, capitalist, and colonial
infrastructure**]{.underline}. When the Justice Department halted
construction of DAPL in October, they also said they would begin looking
into Free Prior Informed Consent legislation. This is a minimal first
step, and we must hold them to it. [**Longstanding alliances** with
progressive parties and politicians are **key to our success**. In the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [Native people have worked
with Democratic elected officials like]{.underline} Bernie [Sanders
and]{.underline} Raúl [Grijalva to advance bills]{.underline} like the
Save Oak Flat Act, which aimed [to stop an international mining
conglomerate from exploiting an Apache sacred site in Arizona. In
Canada, First Nations have supported the New Democratic Party. In New
Zealand, the Maori Rātana religious and political movement has an
alliance with the Labour Party]{.underline} that stretches back to the
1930s. Some indigenous leaders, such as outspoken Aboriginal Australian
leader Pat Dodson, a Labour senator for Western Australia, have won
prominent positions in these parties. This does not mean, of course,
that we should pay deference to elected officials. In 2014, Obama became
one of the first sitting presidents to visit an Indian reservation when
he travelled to Standing Rock. His visit was historically symbolic and
emotionally important, but if Obama fails to stop DAPL, indigenous
people should renounce him. [Politicians are helpful when they change
policies]{.underline} and outcomes. [We]{.underline} cannot and [should
not settle for symbolic victories]{.underline}. [If there is to be an
enduring indigenous-left coalition, the Left must support indigenous
demands for land, jurisdiction, and sovereignty]{.underline}. At their
core, [these demands undermine the imperial cut-and-paste model of the
nation-state]{.underline}, stretching from Hobbes to the present, which
insists that there is room for just one sovereign entity in the state
apparatus. Thomas Piketty's call for a global wealth tax implies an
international governance structure to levy such a tax. He pushes us to
think beyond the state. Similarly, indigenous demands for lands,
jurisdiction, and sovereignty imply that we must think beneath it.

## Alt Fails

### Must GBTL

#### Settler colonialism is inextricably tied to the land -- any alt that falls short of giving back the land will fail

[Taking up dispossession as a failed project]{.underline} [forces us to
move beyond the property paradigm]{.underline} and [to acknowledge
what]{.underline} Aileen Moreton-[Robinson calls **an "ontological
relationship to land**",]{.underline} which she also describes as an
"inalienable relation to land**[" that constitutes an indigenous subject
position]{.underline}**.54 "**[Ontological belonging",]{.underline}**
Moreton-Robinson argues, "**[is omnipresent, and continues to unsettle
non-Indigenous belonging based on illegal dispossession".]{.underline}**
55 In this vein, Eric [Cheyfitz defines land not simply as a resource or
commodity but as "the nonfungible matrix of the community]{.underline}"
[and "the inalienable ground of the communal".]{.underline} 56 And
[for]{.underline} Glen [Coulthard]{.underline}, **[land functions as "an
ontological framework for understanding relationships]{.underline}**".
57 [To entertain the possibility of failure]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} thus [to recognize indigenous sovereignty as "more than
a mere conferral".]{.underline} Instead, as Audra Simpson affirms, "it
is both inherent and unceded". 58 **[To denaturalize dispossession is to
confront "the ontological dilemma indigeneity poses to the colonizing
nation-state".]{.underline}** 59 [This move shifts the conversation from
assumptions about aboriginal dispossession to questions about white
possession]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} its precarity, often
signified by [anxiety]{.underline}.60 And this shift, in turn, raises a
series of new questions about the relationship between primitive
accumulation and settler colonialism. First, would it be more accurate
to describe accumulation by dispossession as accumulation by possession?
Where the possessive investment of 6 N.A. Brown [settlers overlays but
does]{.underline} [not]{.underline} (because it cannot) [extinguish
indigenous ties to a landscape, which remains, in a fundamental sense,
inalienable]{.underline}. Second, is the continuous character of
primitive accumulation contingent on and enabled by the failure of
settler colonialism? In other words, does failure allow processes of
primitive accumulation to endure? Alternately, would settler
colonialism, if successful, actually impede the proliferation of these
accumulation practices? Third, is it possible to identify a unique set
of processes that we might call settler accumulation? 61 In other words,
does a distinct form of accumulation emerge from the dialectic between
primitive accumulation and settler colonialism, which cannot be reduced
to either of its constitutive elements? Finally, **[given that primitive
accumulation might also be described as a failed project]{.underline}**
-- in the sense that it, too, remains unfinished -- [does this recurring
double-failure sustain the dialectic of settler
accumulation]{.underline}? In other words, [does settler accumulation
proliferate by pitting one flexible structure or "condition of
possibility" against another structure?]{.underline} In the abstract,
**[the answers to these questions, particularly the last two, would seem
to be affirmative]{.underline}**. In an effort to discern the logic of
settler accumulation at work in the specific context of the
Alberta/Montana borderlands, these questions resurface in the concluding
sections of this article.

### Postcolonial 

#### Postcolonial critique fails -- doesn't address the ongoing processes of termination and assimilation in the settler colony

**Day 15** Iyko Day, "Being or Nothingness: Indigeneity, Antiblackness,
and Settler Colonial Critique", Critical Ethnic Studies , Vol. 1, No. 2
(Fall 2015), pp. 102-121, University of Minnesota Press,
<https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/jcritethnstud.1.2.0102>, /MegLak

But if we move outside the continental United States, questions raised
by such binaries dissipate in the face of the starkest and most brutal
binary colonial formations. [Occupied Palestine, a comparatively recent
site of settler colonialism, is such a place, powerfully magnifying the
struggle between settler and Indigenous populations in ways that recall
the frontier violence of nineteenth-century America]{.underline}. The
illegal occupation, siege of Gaza, and ongoing construction of
residential settlements on the West Bank is an uncanny corollary to the
lead up to the 1830 Indian Removal Act, which relocated tens of
thousands of peoples from the Southeastern Nations east of the
Mississippi River. From this view, [the]{.underline} glaring binarism of
Occupied Palestine offers a window onto U.S. history. But it is for the
same reason that Bill V. Mullen's [description of Occupied Palestine as
"the most dialectical place on Earth" is unable to capture the racial
heterogeneity of the continental United States in the present
tense.]{.underline}7 Further, in the case of Hawai'i, another relatively
recent site of settler colonialism, Asian Americans have replaced
original white settlers and transformed and extended those eliminatory
logics into a formation of Asian settler colonialism that is also
reflective of the Indigenous/settler binary.8 As Dean Saranillio
explains, "[While migration in and of itself does not equate to
colonialism, migration to a settler colonial space]{.underline}, where
Native lands and resources are under political, ecological, and
spiritual contestation, [means the political agency of immigrant
communities can bolster a colonial system initiated by White
settlers.]{.underline}"9 The lesson that Hawai'i offers is one in which
a formerly exploited migrant population has achieved structural
dominance. Although white settlers exploited indentured Asian laborers
in the 1890s as part of the process of dispossessing Native Hawaiians of
their land, Asian American invocations of "local" identity and rejection
of Native Hawaiian claims for sovereignty reproduce the logics of
colonial dispossession. Here Patrick Wolfe's clarification that settler
colonialism is a "structure not an event" is especially salient.10 In
comparison to Canada or Australia, **[what I would describe as a certain
attenuation in identifying the continental United States as a settler
colony may also be attributed to]{.underline}** an ideology of American
exceptionalism and **[history of empire building]{.underline}**, which
are [possibly the most exemplary expressions of settler
colonialism]{.underline}. Indeed, [what distinguishes the]{.underline}
United States as a [settler colony is the way it epitomizes a paradigm
of endless invasion of both Indigenous and foreign lands]{.underline}.11
Unlike former franchise colonies, such as British India or the Dutch
East Indies---regions where economic exploitation occurred without
large-scale white settlement---[settler colonies are also largely immune
to decolonization because settlers don't leave]{.underline}. They are
"breakaway" colonies insofar as they transfer the power of the
metropolitan center to the periphery, subverting a normative logic of
colonialism.12 In establishing British settler colonies, it was
specifically land acquisition that was the primary objective rather than
the exploitation of Indigenous labor.13 **[Because white settlement was
a primary goal in British North America, Australia, New Zealand, and
South Africa, the process of detaching from British imperial
rule]{.underline}**---becoming "postcolonial" as it were---**[did not
structurally alter the colonial relationship between settlers and
Indigenous populations]{.underline}**. In other words, there is no
"post" to settler colonialism. As Werner Biermann and Reinhart Kössler
reflect on the irony of revolutionary settler independence movements
like those in the United States, "settler counter- imperialism cannot,
in any sense, be considered of an emancipatory nature, but rather as a
defense for atavistic forms of exploitation which by this token take on
a politically anachronistic stature as well."14 Therefore, in settler
colonies, the diminishing role of an imperial metropole actually
facilitated successive stages of Indigenous elimination that involved
invasion, removal, relocation, reservation, termination, and
assimilation. This renders a paradoxical situation where, as Robert J.
C. Young describes it, "[**the postcolonial operates simultaneously as
the colonial**."]{.underline}15

#### A colonial analysis alone fails -- it diverts attention from current hierarchies, and assumes subalternity is created from colonialism -- justifies perm

(de)coloniality are not enough: a post-imperialist perspective",

[The]{.underline} historical, geographical, economic, cultural,
political, social and racial [diversity of the colonial experience is,
sometimes, underestimated by an overall critique of one of the most
powerful attributes of the human species: the propensity to colonize the
entire earth.]{.underline} Human beings could well be called the
'colonizer animal'. If we stretch the amplitude of the colonial drive
that much, a substantial part of the history of Homo Sapiens could be
seen as the history of colonization and of its ideological,
institutional and political legitimations. In this time frame, one that
perhaps could be called an archaeological time frame, post-colonial
situations would include an enormous number of scenarios. Such a
perspective would allow me to go as far as to call, for instance, London
a postcolonial city because one day it was a Roman town called
Londinium. I will not concede to the temptation of this overarching
vision because it would certainly transform colonialism into a sort of
hyper-historicism. Furthermore, the duration of the postcolonial
condition is an area of intense debate, one that is particularly
interesting for Latin Americans since, historically, postcolonialism
started there in the early nineteenth century. [Here I want to grapple
with the consideration of colonialism as a powerful, all-encompassing
historical force that shapes to this day major characteristics of
nation-states that are former colonies]{.underline}. Colonialism and its
effects were at the centre of critical analysis well before
postcolonialism and de-coloniality became focuses of attention.
Neo-colonialism and internal colonialism provided important theoretical
frameworks to analyse the existing inequal- ities within the world
system and within nation-states. The stress on colonialism,
neo-colonialism, internal colonialism, post- colonialism and the
coloniality of power is welcome. [No one doubts the power of
structuration of colonialism. However, I would like to explore the idea
that we cannot think of the 'structural power' of colonialism as a
lasting force that always overruns others, especially those that are
unleashed by what might be called 'the nationality of
power']{.underline}.21 For me, **[postcolonialism and the coloniality of
power coexist in different forms and intensities, in different national
scenarios, with the nationality of power as well as with the globality
of power.]{.underline}** On the one hand, however strong transnational
forces may be, [we cannot diffuse the power of nation-states in global
entities such as the world system, nor can we reduce them to mechanic
responses to supranational dynamics]{.underline}. On the other hand,
[colonialism cannot become an interpretive panacea, nor the latest
example of historical determinism. **The fact that peripheral countries
are the privileged scenario for postcolonial**]{.underline} and
decolonial **[interpretations becomes a problem when we realize that the
most powerful nation-state of current times, the United States, is a
former British colony]{.underline}**. If the explanation for this
exception is that there are different colonial experiences that may
result in different postcolonial and decolonial experiences then
subalternity within the world system is not a necessary result of the
colonial experience or an intrinsic quality of postcoloniality and
decoloniality. What I am saying is that [**an overemphasis on
colonialism and on coloniality can curiously (re)generate precisely what
needs to be criticized and surpassed: an explanation that accepts
subalternity as a destiny of former colonies.**]{.underline} My argument
calls for a sharper consideration of the 'causal hierarchies' among
colonialism and other historical processes in diverse concrete
scenarios.22 I am implying that [by transforming
colonialism]{.underline} and not capitalism [into the primordial focus
of analysis we underestimate the current importance of nation-states and
their elites]{.underline}, as well as deviate from under- standing the
particular characteristics of the power relations of the current
relationships between nation-states and the world system. In some
places, these relationships are 200 years old or more, if we include in
our list the US, the first politically independent modern republic.
[Isn't this a sufficient amount of time to create particular interests
and dynamics that are central to the construction of any future
scenario?]{.underline} If one of the aims of critical theory is to
overcome an unjust past and contribute to the construction of a
different future, then utopias are a most important object of desire in
the progressive intellectual scene. While I am favourable to ideological
struggles\*without them it wouldn't be possible to denaturalize the
naturalized present\*[**I want to advocate for more utopian struggles in
a juncture where there is a dearth of future scenarios strong enough to
galvanize the imagination of a great number of political
actors**.]{.underline} This is one of the reasons why I offered the
notion of post-imperialism. Living in a world region that has a
longstanding experience with imperialism\*in its soft and hard
expressions\*the imagining of life after imperialism can prove to be an
exercise in creativity and audacity\*qualities many times denied to the
'subalterns'.In order to clarify how different colonial enterprises may
be experienced in history and how they may shape different senses of the
future I will recur to a reading of the Brazilian postcolonial and
national history. My arguments suppose that colonialist 'structural
power' coexists not only with world system forces but also with the rise
of post-colonial projects that may congeal and prompt the nationality of
power.

## AT Ontology

#### Reject an ontologized understanding of settler colonial violence -- Settler Colonial society's move for "empty lands" denies Indigenous populations corporeal existence.

Beyond this inconsistency, [the liberal multiculturalist
agenda]{.underline} that Wilderson and Sexton [project(ed) into
Indigenous sovereignty willfully evacuates any Indigenous refusal of a
colonial politics of recognition]{.underline}. Among other broad
strokes, Sexton states, "as a rule, Native Studies reproduces the
dominant liberal political narrative of emancipation and
enfranchisement."46 This provides a basis for Wilderson's assertion that
Indigenous sovereignty engages in a liberal politics of state
legitimation through recognition be- cause "treaties are forms of
articulation" that buttress "the interlocutory life of America as a
coherent (albeit genocidal) idea."47 But such [a depoliticized liberal
project is frankly incompatible with Indigenous activism and scholarship
that emerges from Native studies in North America.]{.underline} The main
argument in Glen Sean Coulthard's book Red Skin, White Masks is to
categorically reject "the liberal recognition-based approach to
Indigenous self- determination."48 [This is not a politics of
legitimizing Indigenous nations through state recognition but rather one
of refusal, a refusal to be recognized and thus interpellated by the
settler colonial nation-state.]{.underline} Drawing on Fanon, [Coulthard
describes the "necessity on the part of the oppressed to 'turn away'
from their other-oriented master-dependency, and to instead struggle for
freedom on their own terms and in accordance with their own
values."]{.underline}49 [It is also difficult to reconcile the
depoliticized narrative of "resurgence and recovery"]{.underline} that
Wilderson and Sexton [attribute to Indigenous sovereignty in the face of
Idle No More, the anticapitalist Indigenous sovereignty movement in
Canada whose national railway and highway blockades have seriously
destabilized the expropriation of natural resources for the global
market.]{.underline} [These are]{.underline} examples that Coulthard
describes as ["direct action" rather than negotiation---in other words,
antagonism, not conflict resolution:]{.underline} They \[blockades\] are
a crucial act of negation insofar as they seek to impede or block the
flow of resources currently being transported to international markets
from oil and gas fields, refineries, lumber mills, mining operations,
and hydroelectric facilities located on the dispossessed lands of
Indigenous nations. These modes of direct action . . . seek to have a
negative impact on the economic infrastructure that is core to the
colonial accumulation of capital in settler-political economies like
Canada's.50 These tactics are part of what Audra Simpson calls a
"cartography of refusal" that "negates the authority of the other's
gaze."51 It is impossible to frame the blockade movement, which has
become the greatest threat to Canada's resource agenda,52 as a struggle
for "enfranchisement[." Idle No More is]{.underline} not in "conflict"
with the Canadian nation-state; it is in [a struggle against the very
premise of settler colonial capitalism that requires the elimination of
Indigenous peoples.]{.underline} As Coulthard states unambiguously, "For
Indigenous nations to live, capitalism must die."53 [But perhaps my own
defense of Indigenous decolonization movements for sovereignty begs a
larger question about whether sovereignty in itself offers a radical
politics that can encompass or mobilize a black radical tradition rooted
in the project of abolition]{.underline}. And it is here that I agree
with Sexton's intervention to problematize the idea that antiracist
agendas must emerge from the foundational priority of Indigenous
sovereignty and restoration of land.54 But against the totalizing frame
of Afro-pessimism, [I want to stress instead the pitfalls of any
antidialectical approach to the political economy of the settler
colonial racial state]{.underline} from the position of either
Indigenous or antiblack exceptionalism. [Settler colonial racial
capitalism is not a thing but a social relation]{.underline}. As such,
it is not produced out of the causal relationships that Sexton puts
forward here: "Slavery, as it were, precedes and prepares the way for
colonialism, its forebear or fundament or support. Colonialism, as it
were, the issue or heir of slavery, its outgrowth or edifice or
monument."55 [The nearly totalizing black existential frame is similarly
based on a questionable construction of epistemic privilege: \[black
existence\] does relate to the totality; it indicates the (repressed)
truth of the political and economic system.]{.underline} That is to say,
the whole range of positions within the racial formation is most fully
understood from this vantage point, not unlike the way in which the
range of gender and sexual variance under patriarchal and
heteronormative regimes is most fully understood through lenses that are
feminist and queer.56 According to Sexton, no other oppression is
reducible to antiblackness, but [the relative totality of antiblackness
is the privileged perspective from which to understand racial formation
more broadly.]{.underline} But [unlike the way feminist and queer
critical theory interrogate heteropatriarchy from a subjectless
standpoint, Sexton's entire point seems to rest on the very specificity
and singularity---rather than subjectlessness---of black critical
theory's capacity to understand race.]{.underline} The privilege of
[this embodied viewpoint similarly relies on rigidly binaristic
conceptions of land and bodily integrity.]{.underline} He writes, "If
the indigenous relation to land precedes and exceeds any regime of
property, then the slave's inhabitation of the earth precedes and
exceeds any prior relation to land---landlessness. And selflessness is
the correlate. No ground for identity, no ground to stand (on)."57 In
other words, the slave's nonrelation to her body precedes and exceeds
any other body's relation to land. However[, the settler colonial
designation of the United States and Canada as terra nullius---as
legally empty lands---denies the very corporeality of Indigenous
populations to inhabit land, much less have any rights to it. Alongside
genocidal elimination, the erasure of Indigenous corporeal existence is
inseparable from the ground it doesn't stand on, or is removed
from.]{.underline}

#### Their analytic is too abstracted and conflates a metaphysical constant with discrete events of oppression

**Pappas 17** -- PhD, Associate Professor of Philosophy at Texas A& M
University (Gregory, "The Limitations and Dangers of Decolonial
Philosophies: Lessons from Zapatista Luis Villoro," *Radical Philosophy
Review*, DOI: 10.5840/radphilrev201732768) \-\-- ability edited

For decolonialists the sickness that afflicts Latin America is the
global hegemony---economic, military, political, and cultural---of the
West, first via Europe and then the United States, broadcast under the
philosophy of the Enlightenment with Europe carrying the mission. As
Vallega explains, "Latin America suffered and continues to suffer under
western hegemonic modernity and its system of power and knowledge."19
Villoro believed that at the turn of the twentieth century [one of the
modern ideas we inherited that must be questioned is "global
explanations" because "general ideologies tend to slip into
totalitarianism in our thinking."]{.underline}20 I think Villoro's
reservations are warranted and can be extended to decolonial thought.
Granted, [a theory of grand historical evil and systematic sickness in
the Americas can have great explanatory power and provide theoretical
comfort,21 **but**]{.underline} where are we standing when we start with
such large historical metanarratives? [**How is it this not a God's-eye
view of history?**]{.underline} Is there a danger of [slipping back into
a form of universalism, which they have explicitly avoided? Isn't there
a danger that when a theory explains so much it becomes **nonfalsifiable
and therefore nonempirical?**]{.underline} In any case,
[the]{.underline} quest for a [comprehensive explanation]{.underline}
and a grand historical narrative [is also in danger of not capturing
the]{.underline} historical and [concrete particularity (pluralism,
complexity, uniqueness) of actual injustices. When we start at the broad
level of]{.underline} globality and [history as
decolonialists]{.underline} often [do, there is a risk of
oversimplifying and encouraging]{.underline} blindness [\[ignorance\]
about concrete injustices. Consulting recent rigorous
research]{.underline} done by historians and social anthropologist about
Latin America (more on this later) [confirms what many know from simply
living there: most injustices in different parts of the Americas are
**so complex** that any simple explanation merits the suspicion of being
**wishful** **thinking**.]{.underline} To be fair, compared to Marxism
the decolonial turn added complexity and made a significant shift.
Marxism as a tool was not sensitive enough to the realities on the
ground in Latin America. It was a universal model that did not
adequately address its particular problems. However, decolonialists do
not seem to have abandoned or questioned a similar methodological
starting point. As a result, decolonial theories may sometimes be
presented with the same pretension of offering a universal diagnosis of
the complex and tragic problems of Latin America. Perhaps a more
pluralistic and context-sensitive approach could avoid some of the
dangers I have presented. Here is where the contrast with Villoro is
useful. To be sure, Villoro was critical of the same things as the
decolonialists: the Eurocentric narrative, modernity, liberalism, and so
on. However, when he takes a reflective historical perspective about
these large historical and lumpy categories there is a difference in how
he does it. He anchors his account in his local present situation, is
very specific about what particular aspects of modernity or liberalism
are problematic, and does not have one preferred category of analysis
such as coloniality. [For]{.underline} most [decolonial
theorists,]{.underline} however, the legacy of [colonialism is central
(understood broadly as coloniality), and the situation of the oppressed
is]{.underline} to be [analyzed in relation to a global
narrative]{.underline} in which Europe is at its center or in relation
to modernity or a global capitalist system. The decolonial project is
centered on detecting plural manifestations of the single evolving
domination (a social pathology) that started in 1492. Liberation is
understood as decolonization via undoing "the coloniality of power" and
affirming what has been "conceal\[ed\] by the Western modern epistemic
hegemony."22 In contrast, at the center of Villoro's approach is
liberation from domination, and [the causes of domination
are]{.underline} plural and [contextual and therefore too complex to
be]{.underline} articulated or framed by a global theory of domination.
For Villoro liberation is a local event; one of its tools is to
sometimes take a global perspective, and the complexity of the problems
on the ground may not be [fully captured by even our best academic
global historical narratives and categories]{.underline}. He inquired
into the history of a systematic injustice in order to facilitate
inquiry into the present unique, context-bound injustice. If injustice
is an illness then Villoro's approach takes as its main focus diagnosing
and treating the particular present illness, i.e., the particular
injustice in a corner of Mexico, and not a global "social pathology" or
some single transhistorical source of injustice. As concepts and
categories, global hierarchies, white supremacy, and coloniality can be
great tools that can have planetary significance. One could even argue
that they pick out much-larger areas of people's lives and injustices
than the categories of class and gender. However, in spite of their
reach and explanatory theoretical value they are nothing more than tools
to make reference to and ameliorate particular injustices experienced
(suffered) in the midst of a particular and unique relationship in a
situation. Why is this important? [In present situations]{.underline}
(events) of injustice in the Americas [there are not only intersecting
histories of white supremacy, capitalist exploitation, and patriarchy;
there are also unique events]{.underline}, multiple countries [with
different complex histories]{.underline} and present circumstances, [as
well as a variety of responsible agents]{.underline}---local and
international governments, corporations, particular individuals and
communities. [Regardless of how much]{.underline} a theory of global
domination that centers on [coloniality can actually explain, it is
reasonable to worry about what it leaves out and question the extent to
which it really helps those who are victims of injustice]{.underline}. A
wider net may bring more fish from the ocean, but I am not sure this
applies to injustices. [Such theories may lead to analysis]{.underline}
or diagnosis [that while true at some level, may]{.underline} actually
[have very little to offer in terms of more specific diagnoses and
solutions that can be of any help to someone suffering an
injustice]{.underline}. However, for Mignolo coloniality is "the
underlying logic of the foundation and unfolding of Western civilization
from the Renaissance to today"23 [Coloniality helps explain how race and
gender became the basis of classification in the Americas, but it
remains an open question how these categories actually operate in
particular countries or even in particular unjust events. We can say all
we want that the oppressed live in power structures located in global
hierarchies and a world-system, but that does not fully capture where
they are. However useful and true that account may be about someone's
particular circumstances, it is still **overabstracted**.
Knowing]{.underline} how people have been classified according to [a
colonial matrix of power is important, but only insofar as it may help
us inquire about the present actual causes of an injustice]{.underline}.
Moreover, [it is not obvious how the use of a single]{.underline} name
and the [prism]{.underline} of a single cause [helps in trying to
ameliorate the particular and context-specific evils from which
particular countries and people]{.underline} in Latin America
[suffer]{.underline}. One could reply that my worries are misplaced.
Calling decolonization the cure may suggest that coloniality is some
sort of single homogeneous cause, but the [decolonialists have
distinguished between different types of coloniality and have included
in their diagnosis a plurality of causes such as exploitation of
resources, political manipulation, and assimilation of people from other
cultures]{.underline}. If this is the case then why not address these
more particular evils, unless one is really committed to some unitary
account in which all of these evils can be reduced to a singular cause?

#### Reifying settler colonialism as transhistorical and inevitable makes resistance impossible

Corey **SNELGROVE ET AL.**, University of British Columbia; Rita Kaur
Dhamoon, University of Victoria; and Jeff Corntassel, University of
Victoria, **14** \["Unsettling settler colonialism: The discourse and
politics of settlers, and solidarity with Indigenous nations,"
*Decolonization: Indigeneity, Education & Society*, Vol. 3, No. 2, 2014,
p. 1-32,
http://decolonization.org/index.php/des/article/view/21166/17970\]

[Rita]{.underline}: Corey, your question is helpful, and Jeff's response
also helps me think through the movement between time-situated and
place-based practices of 'solidarity' and ways of thinking about these
[situated practices in terms of an ethos of 'unsettled
solidarities']{.underline} that moves across time and space, that [is a
way of being in the world, a set of ongoing relations]{.underline}.
Where I, [where we]{.underline}, [are **never outside of struggle**,
everyone is 'structurally implicated' in the dispossession of Indigenous
lands. Everyone is differentially]{.underline} structurally [implicated,
where the ideology of presumed consent underlies settler
colonialism]{.underline}.

[Jeff]{.underline}: I would add that [living on another Indigenous
nation's territory]{.underline} also [carries an obligation to support
those defending their homelands]{.underline}. Cheryl [Bryce from
Songhees First Nation started the "Community Tool Shed"]{.underline} in
2009 [to generate support for the restoration of Lekwungen food systems.
The Community Tool Shed]{.underline} in Victoria, British Columbia, [is
where settlers and Indigenous peoples can come together to rid the land
of invasive species]{.underline}, such as Scottish Broom, and to
revitalize traditional plants such as kwetlal or camas. [Cheryl's focus
for this]{.underline} informal [group is on reclaiming traditional place
names, educating people about the destructiveness of invasive species,
and reinstating Lekwungen food systems]{.underline}. The tool shed meets
once per month to pull invasive species on places that have been managed
by Cheryl's family for generations, such as Meegan (aka, Beacon Hill
Park), and Sitchamalth (Willows Beach). [To a 'resident' of Lekwungen
homelands, the above-mentioned places are public lands. This
demonstrates the urgency of **reclaiming Indigenous place names** in
tandem with the restoration of Indigenous foodscapes and
landscapes]{.underline}. The May 22, 2013 [reclamation of the name
PKOLS]{.underline} (formerly known as Mount Douglas) [is one of many
examples where communities can come together to demand representation on
their own terms. These are **everyday acts of resurgence** that
highlight the terrain of Indigenous struggles to restore and reconnect a
place-based existence]{.underline}.

[Corey]{.underline}: And [both examples]{.underline} you highlighted
Jeff [**do not foreclose a wide-range of participants**. The PKOLS
reclamation led by the W̱ SÁNEĆ peoples, involved participation from
Indigenous peoples across]{.underline} Vancouver Island and across
[Turtle Island, it involved the university through the Indigenous
Governance program, and it involved local, non-Indigenous, activist
groups]{.underline}, most notably Social Coast. [The Community Tool
Shed]{.underline}, a project that I've also been involved in for the
past two years, [does something similar]{.underline}. What I find really
interesting in this work is that [settlers and Indigenous peoples
challenge our environmentally degraded and colonial present
simultaneously. Yet, there is still attention paid to the different
roles and responsibilities in this work]{.underline}. For instance,
non-Lekwungen people in removing invasive species, and Lekwungen people
in managing these lands and in harvesting plants such as camas. So
unlike other stewardship groups around Victoria, [those participating
are not seeking to depoliticize this work, nor do they argue that this
work erases their complicity or their potential complicity in
colonization]{.underline}. In supporting Cheryl's assertion of her roles
and responsibilities, they aren't seeking to restore land in order to
claim it for themselves. They aren't Locke redux. And, given the nature
and extent of Broom here -- you find it pretty much everywhere around
Southern Vancouver Island, something like 18,000 seeds are produced in a
single plant, and those seeds can lie dormant for up to thirty years --
pulling broom one time really does not mean much. So [there is a demand
for long- term work, which itself can help build accountability through
such place-based relationships. And since land is the irreducible
element of settler colonialism, and that environmental degradation has
often proceeded through and in support of settler colonialism, it
provides an example of non-Indigenous practices with the land that
**aren't necessarily colonial**]{.underline}. Now I'm not saying that
this is an example of decolonization or that those involved are somehow
not settlers. After all, decolonization and the transformation of
settlers requires subjective and objective transformations. Rather [it's
a practice that **does not reify colonization**, and thus **challenges**
settler colonial studies **construction** of settler colonialism as
**inevitable and transhistorical**]{.underline}.

#### Ontologizing the settler-native binary entrenches critique into moralized outrage while precluding affective alliances from forming to pursue decolonization.

Rachel **BUSBRIDGE**, Alexander von Humboldt Postdoctoral Fellow in
Institut für Islamwissenschaft (Institute of Islamic Studies), Freie
Universität Berlin, **17** \["Israel-Palestine and the Settler Colonial
'Turn': From Interpretation to Decolonization," *Theory, Culture &
Society*, First Published: January 23, 2017, p. 1-25, Accessed Online
through Emory Libraries\]

By way of conclusion, however, [I would like to point towards the
challenges of the settler colonial paradigm's insistence on an ontology
of absolute polarity of settler and native for the types of political
mobilizations and struggles it could inaugurate]{.underline}. To be
sure, [there are immense difficulties in reckoning with heterogeneity in
seemingly permanent structures of settler colonialism which]{.underline}
all too easily [assimilate **nuance into legitimation**]{.underline};
these difficulties are only amplified in the context of long-term
intractable conflict like that in Israel-Palestine. [Yet]{.underline},
as Joyce Dalsheim (2013) has argued in the context of Israeli settlers,
[the **entrenchment** of polarized discourse means that we often **miss
alternative models** of political community that may better serve the
project of decolonization. It would]{.underline} certainly [be a shame
for the paradigm's inconsistencies regarding a decolonization
effectively rendered impossible to stand against its broader resonance,
just as it would the disciplinary dimensions of the settler colonial
ontology to **shut down debate**]{.underline} -- [or]{.underline},
indeed, [joint mobilization]{.underline} -- [between those broadly on
the same page]{.underline} concerning Palestine. In his work on joint
Arab-Jewish activism, Marcelo Svirsky (2014: 328) maintains that [what
settler colonial studies needs 'is a corrective ontology and an
affective change of heart']{.underline}. I thus end with the caution
that [without this affective change in heart the settler colonial
paradigm may continue to facilitate transnational solidarity and
international sympathy, but may ultimately **fail to extend** beyond a
politics of moral outrage]{.underline}.
