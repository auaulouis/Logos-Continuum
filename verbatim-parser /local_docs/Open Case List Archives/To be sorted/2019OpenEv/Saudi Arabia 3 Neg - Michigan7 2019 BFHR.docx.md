A Better Approach As regional tensions rise and with Yemen a possible
trigger for a broader conflagration, [there is an urgent need for
international involvement. Two parallel efforts are required, the first
focused on saving the Stockholm Agreement, the second on halting
cross-border attack]{.underline}s between the Huthi and Saudi Arabia.
[International actors]{.underline}, notably the UN Security Council's
permanent members, [ought to seize the initiative]{.underline},
[revive]{.underline} their active support for [UN-led
mediation]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} [pressure the parties to
de-escalate]{.underline}. On the first track, [negotiators should pursue
a compromise that allows the parties to move beyond the Stockholm
Agreement and beyond Hodeida to focus on a broader political
settlement]{.underline}. **[This would entail establishing minimum,
mutually agreed requirements for the agreement's
implementation]{.underline}**. Given disagreements between the sides,
[this likely would mean a more limited short-term understanding of what
needs to happen in Hodeida, leaving negotiations over implementing the
rest of the agreement to proceed as a subset of, or parallel to, broader
peace talks]{.underline}. After seven months, it has become clear that
demilitarising the city and ports is not solely a technical but also a
political issue. In mid-July, members of the RCC met on a UN-operated
ship off the coast of Hodeida and finalised a technical plan for
redeployments. But the most contentious issue, which the Stockholm
Agreement left relatively vague, concerns the identity of local security
forces, which is tied to the question of sovereignty. The RCC members
did not and cannot resolve this issue. As noted, the UN mediators sought
to sidestep that question, explicitly stating that identity of local
security forces was without prejudice to the matter of ultimate
sovereignty. But the government now rejects that outcome, and after
months of wrangling, they are unlikely to agree on a comprehensive
solution on local security forces in the short term. That said, [with
international backing, a partial stop-gap solution for all or part of
Hodeida city might still be achievable]{.underline}. For example, the
[parties could]{.underline} [agree]{.underline} that, [as a means of
pivoting to broader peace talks, the two sides would implement the first
phase of redeployments already under discussion]{.underline} -- **[the
three ports and the part of the city critical to humanitarian
access]{.underline}** -- [leaving the]{.underline} second phase (which
focuses on the [rest of the city]{.underline}) [for later.]{.underline}
[Implementing phase one does not require a comprehensive agreement on
local security forces.]{.underline} [But it does entail agreement on
a]{.underline} tripartite [monitoring mechanism involving the Huthis,
Yemeni government]{.underline} and UN, [as well as agreement on the
identity of local security forces in the phase one areas,]{.underline}
[and a plan for how to deal with revenues from the ports]{.underline}.
As part of such a compromise, those areas would be secured neither by
pre-2014 forces (the government's stated position) nor by the forces
that are there today (the Huthis' implicit view). Instead, the [UN could
vet current local security forces to ensure they are professionally
trained personnel and that their senior commanders held rank within the
military and security services before 2014]{.underline}. **[A limited
agreement like this may be easier for both parties to accept as it deals
with a small subset of the city's security forces and a limited part of
the city, making UN vetting more feasible and avoiding perceptions that
it is a comprehensive, final plan.]{.underline}** [The
Huthis]{.underline}, [who are concerned that a gap between implementing
phases one and two will leave the ports vulnerable]{.underline} to
attack from forces that would still be positioned north of the city
after phase one redeployments, [need assurances from the P5 that
implementing phase one would not lead the government to pursue a
military advantage]{.underline}. **[It may be easier to convince the
Huthis of this now that the UAE has partially withdrawn from the Red Sea
coast front]{.underline}**. To convince the parties, the UN will need
robust diplomatic assistance. The P5 have in the past demonstrated they
could be effective when working together on Yemen; more recently, they
seemed to find agreement on 10 June when the Security Council issued a
statement backing Griffiths, calling for the implementation of the
Stockholm Agreement and a political solution to the war. Such
expressions of international consensus now ought to be backed up with
concrete action. [Specifically, the P5 could set up a contact group at
both the ambassadorial and the ministry level to work alongside the
special envoy,]{.underline} comprising, in addition to them, the EU and
possibly Oman in supporting roles, along with other states acceptable to
both. Enlisting the P5 would be important given the mistrust the Huthis
feel toward the Quad -- the group composed of the U.S., UK, Saudi Arabia
and UAE that presently purports to take a leading role in multilateral
efforts to end the war. By contrast, they likely would feel more
comfortable with Russia and China in the mix. [The second track, aimed
at military de-escalation between Saudi Arabia and the Huthis, should
pursue a mutual freeze: **a halt in Huthi cross-border attacks in
exchange for a pause or significant reduction in Saudi airstrikes
against Huthi targets.**]{.underline} [This would require direct
engagement between the two parties]{.underline}, [including]{.underline}
in all likelihood [face-to-face meetings]{.underline} between senior
Huthi and Saudi officials. **[The Huthis previously signalled interest
in such a deal]{.underline}**; [Saudi officials have resisted
it]{.underline}, on two grounds. First, at a practical level, they argue
that this would give the Huthis too great an advantage in their battle
against less capable government forces. Second, they reject any
equivalency between the actions of a non-state actor threatening a
sovereign state and those of a state responding to the legitimate
invitation of the Yemeni government. Many other obstacles stand in the
way: the Huthis might not agree to anything less than a full halt in
Saudi airstrikes, which Riyadh might reject and more hard-line Huthi
elements might act as spoilers and resist such a de-escalation. [**But
potential benefits to the kingdom are significant.** At a time of rising
tensions with Iran, Riyadh might see an advantage in neutralising a
front that has offered Tehran a low-cost, high-yield opportunity to
bleed its regional rival]{.underline}. **[An understanding between the
kingdom and the Huthis would lessen the rebel group's dependence on Iran
and could trigger tensions between those who are more and those who are
less beholden to the Islamic Republic.]{.underline}** While not a
substitute for Yemen-Yemeni talks, [mutual de-escalation could pave the
way for broader discussions of issues at the core of the Saudi-Huthi
relationship]{.underline}: [border security,]{.underline} the [Huthis'
access to heavy weapons]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the nature of
their [relationship with Iran.]{.underline} **[Huthi officials assert
they are open to discussing these matters]{.underline}** [and
claim]{.underline} they are ready to address legitimate Saudi concerns;
indeed, they say that, for reasons of geographic proximity, [their most
important long-term relationship must be with Riyadh, not Tehran and
that their current posture is a function of the ongoing war, not an
inherent affinity to the Islamic Republic]{.underline}. [Saudi-Huthi
channels are nothing new]{.underline}; they have existed for some time
and, according to Saudi officials, exist in some form to this day. [But
Riyadh till now has taken the position that, in order for it to take
these contacts seriously, the rebel movement must demonstrate its
goodwill upfront --]{.underline} whether in the form of a unilateral
cessation of cross-border strikes or a gesture signalling willingness to
distance itself from Iran. [Those are unlikely to happen]{.underline} as
a precondition for meaningful talks; [if they are to occur at
all,]{.underline} however, [it could be as one of their early
outcomes]{.underline}. To **[overcome Saudi hesitation, the U.S. could
play a leading role by both encouraging and reassuring Riyadh as well as
by resuming their own contacts with the Huthis to help choreograph the
two sides' mutual steps]{.underline}**. [In the Huthis' mind, the U.S.
is the party most capable of influencing Saudi Arabia**; they therefore
likely would be willing to accept a U.S. role in the
discussions**]{.underline}. Of course, [Washington]{.underline} cannot
do this alone insofar as it is viewed by the Huthis as a biased
interlocutor; it [must team up with the UN]{.underline} and possibly
Oman in shepherding the talks and helping both sides follow through on
any commitments they make. VII. Conclusion The sense of urgency that
seized the U.S. and others between October and December 2018 has faded,
but the importance of ending the Yemen war has not. Yemen increasingly
has become hostage to regional tensions while regional stability is
increasingly a function of what happens in Yemen. For those reasons
alone, [international actors should make it a priority to safeguard the
Stockholm Agreement; use it to pivot to more comprehensive political
talks;]{.underline} and firewall, as much as possible, what happens in
Yemen from what is happening between Iran on the one hand and the U.S.
and its Gulf allies on the other. Time is of the essence. The threat of
an attack on Hodeida has receded for now, but every day that passes
without progress in implementing the Stockholm Agreement gives that
threat new life. And each time a Huthi drone or missile reaches Saudi
soil, the risk of a broader regional confrontation grows commensurately.
Both outcomes would be tragic, but both can still be averted.

[A New Framework, A New Peace?]{.underline} As promising as this
momentum may be, it reflects the modest horizons of an anti-war strategy
pursued through legislative means. [Restricting arms]{.underline} sales
promises to slow the war and perhaps encourage negotiations. It **[does
not, however, speak directly to the wreckage of the war or the almost
unfathomable challenge of reconstruction]{.underline}**. [The war
econom]{.underline}y, which generates profits from the clandestine trade
in people as much as in goods, [will be difficult to supplant;
cross-border reconstruction promises to lock in regional
clientelism]{.underline}. This process in Yemen parallels developments
in Syria but also draws on longstanding Gulf
dynamics.[\[19\]](https://merip.org/2019/03/toward-a-just-peace-in-yemen/#_edn19)
Should US and European supporters of the coalition manage to incentivize
a [negotiated settlement]{.underline} of some kind, that agreement
[would need to address these concerns.]{.underline} **[And such a peace
would have to reckon with the multi-faceted dynamics of the
war]{.underline}**---[dynamics that are ignored by the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and in the UN Security Council
resolutions **[that continue to treat the war as a two-sided
conflict]{.underline}**. In the meantime, parts of Yemen are
experiencing piecemeal reconstruction through the private sector, an
approach that US and Gulf actors strongly favor but one that may well
hinder the restoration of state institutions or
capacity.[[\[20\]](https://merip.org/2019/03/toward-a-just-peace-in-yemen/#_edn20)
This approach]{.underline} does not challenge---and [may even
entrench---the material interests of external actors who have already
shaped the war and its antecedent conflicts]{.underline}. **[Absent a
significant shift in policy---in Yemen and in the region---toward one
that promotes accountable governance and the rebuilding of a shared
concept of the public, it seems unlikely that such an approach to
reconstruction will support a just or sustainable peace]{.underline}**.
Just as the war has fragmented and isolated Yemen and Yemenis,
[reconstruction as it is currently unfolding amounts to little more than
the privatization of peace]{.underline}.

Channel"
<https://warontherocks.com/2019/01/its-time-for-a-serious-saudi-houthi-back-channel/>)mba-alb

[Hopes remain high for the peace process]{.underline} currently underway
between the Yemeni government and the Houthis, in no small part because
U.N.-appointed Special Envoy Martin Griffiths has set such low
expectations to begin with. Griffiths notably termed the meetings
launched in December confidence-building "consultations" rather than
peace talks. His pragmatic calibration has produced slow progress
plagued by fits and starts, but has also led to the first successful
effort to bring the parties together since the collapse of U.N.-led
negotiations in August 2016. Yet [his goal]{.underline} --- eventual
peace negotiations that lay the foundation for a durable political
settlement of Yemen's catastrophic four-year civil war --- [are unlikely
to]{.underline} meet the paramount objective that fueled the
intervention by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in the first
place: [end]{.underline}ing [Iranian influence in Yemen]{.underline}.
[Resolving that issue requires a peace settlement that reorients the
Houthis toward an altogether different arrangement with their Saudi
neighbor]{.underline}. **[The Houthi-Iranian relationship has steadily
deepened over the course of the war, but it is vulnerable to reversal
---]{.underline}** [as episodic Houthi signaling to Riyadh
demonstrates]{.underline}. [Riyadh has leverage to undermine Tehran's
project in Yemen.]{.underline} **[We come to this set of conclusions
from a period of deep experience in the region]{.underline}**. [One of
us was U.S. ambassador to the United Arab Emirates from 2014 to 2018 and
deputy assistant secretary of state for the Arabian Peninsula prior to
that, with considerable policy time on Yemen. The other has followed
Yemen for a dozen years as a political analyst, including seven years in
the Middle East and four years in the New York City Police Department
Counterterrorism Bureau]{.underline}. **[Our experience inside
government working with Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, on the one hand, and
speaking with people who know the Houthis well, on the other, reinforces
our belief that the time is ripe for Saudi Arabia to deepen back-channel
talks with the Houthis in parallel and in support of, but separate from,
the U.N.-led talks]{.underline}**. [What the Saudis Want]{.underline}
While the Saudi decision to intervene in Yemen in 2015 ostensibly came
in response to a plea from Yemeni President Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi,
[Riyadh made clear from the outset that its overriding aim was to
scupper the burgeoning relationship between the Houthis and
Tehran]{.underline}. The singularity of that issue for Saudi Arabia has
only been reinforced by the Iranian transfer of advanced missile
technology and training to the Houthis, enabling the rebel group to
strike deep into Saudi territory and threaten international shipping in
the Bab al-Mandeb. [Four years on, Saudi Arabia's ultimate strategic aim
remains unchanged: ending Iran's proxy-building aspirations in Yemen and
thereby reducing the threat to the Saudi homeland]{.underline}.
**[Serious, direct talks with the Houthis are the best means for
achieving that goal.]{.underline}** What the Houthis Want The Houthis'
ultimate strategic goals remain murky. One northern Yemeni with a deep
understanding of the group told us, "Sometimes I don't know if the
Houthis themselves know." [**Yet the Houthis have long privately
signaled an interest in direct talks** with the Saudis, more so than
they have in interaction with the Hadi government, which they know has a
limited political half-life]{.underline}. [Such Saudi-Houthi contacts
have been attempted on and off throughout the conflict, albeit without
lasting results]{.underline}. In assessing what the Houthis want, it is
important to note the "Houthis" are not a monolith --- many groups in
Yemen that are deemed pro-Houthi and/or pro-Ansar Allah (the Houthi
family's political entity) are more accurately defined as anti-Saudi at
this stage in the conflict. Even at its ideological core, members of the
al-Houthi family itself as well as Ansar Allah fall on a spectrum
between more moderate and more hardcore camps. A Yemen scholar who knows
the Houthis well told us that the moderates are in favor of dropping the
Houthi sarkha (or slogan) --- "God is Great, Death to America, Death to
Israel, Curse the Jews, Victory to Islam." The most militant are said to
see the sarkha as an effective rallying cry and to be increasingly under
the sway of Iranian revolutionary ideology[. A serious and sustained
effort at Saudi-Houthi talks might offer an opportunity to marginalize
the hardcore elements. Diplomacy has a way of marginalizing the fringes
in the same way that war emboldens them]{.underline}. This same
factionalism renders the task of coming up with a comprehensive list of
Houthi demands difficult --- but not impossible. [A close reading of
Houthi rhetoric and history, familiarity with their prior demands as
laid out in several political documents]{.underline}, including the
National Dialogue outcomes and the Peace and National Partnership
Agreement, [as well as private conversation]{.underline}s over the
course of months with a range of people [who have close contact with the
group and family]{.underline} [has allowed us to elaborate on the
Houthis' likely core concerns in any Saudi-Houthi talks]{.underline}.
Recognition **[The Houthis want recognition]{.underline}** that they are
and will remain a marked part of Yemen's political and religious
universe. In U.N.-led peace talks, the Houthis are likely to present
Ansar Allah as a national, non-sectarian movement with demands harking
back to the National Dialogue outcomes, specifically for senior-level
representation in a post-conflict transitional government and freedom of
religion[. In talks with Riyadh, they may also seek, at the minimum, an
end to Saudi-funded Salafism in north Yemen]{.underline}, which began in
the 1970s and became a source of mounting friction and eventual armed
conflict in the 2000s. As a prominent family with a long history of
religious scholarship that claims lineage tracing back to the Prophet
Muhammad, the al-Houthi family actively participated in the Zaydi
revivalist movement that developed in response to this Salafi incursion.
Zaydis are a small Shi'a sect of Islam --- notably different from the
Shi'ism followed in Iran --- who are predominantly located in Yemen's
northern highlands. The Houthi family's most outspoken son, Hussein
al-Houthi, conveyed fear of Zaydi eradication and railed against U.S.
and other foreign interventionism before he was killed by the Yemeni
military in 2004. Nowadays, the once Zaydi revivalist family markets
itself as a national movement and avoids language that might ostracize
its non-Zaydi allies. Calls for political recognition will thus
dominate, and any call for religious recognition would likely be couched
in the language of religious freedom and non-intervention for all.
[Territorial Integrity and Security Assurances]{.underline} Six wars in
Sa'ada against the former President Ali Abdullah Saleh's government
between 2004 and 2010 --- with Riyadh joining in 2009 --- has deepened a
Houthi fixation on territorial security and integrity. The Saudis and
Houthis are likely worlds apart on what they consider the Houthi domain.
Regardless, Riyadh is likely to insist the Houthis disarm entirely,
while the Houthis will almost certainly insist on retaining weapons for
their own defense. Revenge, after all, will be a powerful post-conflict
motivator in Yemen's tribal society, and the Houthis have much to answer
for in the eyes of Saleh loyalists, among others. They will also remain
a target of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. As part of their call for
"national partnership," the Houthis will also petition for integration
of their forces into the national army. Perhaps most importantly, the
Houthis will want security assurances that --- when the world turns its
attention away from Yemen --- Saudi Arabia's forces will not roll over
the border and reengage militarily. [Economic
Independence/Interdependence]{.underline} While northern Yemen has been
especially hard-hit by coalition airstrikes, the issue of Saudi
reconstruction aid will be a sensitive one. As one Yemen specialist
suggested to us, "Some people in the region will not 'eat meat' from
Saudi hands however desperate they are." Getting critical reconstruction
assistance --- even from third parties --- as part of a larger
settlement, however, will moot Tehran otherwise moving in to exploit the
need. The Houthis require an economic lifeline for their northern region
post-conflict, a need that could be partly addressed by increased border
trade with Saudi Arabia. Both parties also have an interest in stemming
smuggling, trafficking, and other ills that have long plagued the Houthi
home province of Saada. As one scholar on north Yemen told us: "The
\[northern\] tribes are exhausted, but they need something to do."
[Guarantees of Foreign Non-Interference]{.underline} [Antipathy to
foreign interference runs deep in the Yemeni body politic]{.underline},
and the Houthis are no exception. Importantly, **[this animosity applies
in equal measure to Iran as well as the Gulf coalition
members]{.underline}**. [In the Houthi view, they did not spend years
fighting Salafism only to become the proxy of yet another school of
Islam that fails to recognize the founder of Zaydi Islam and seeks to
control them]{.underline}. **[One source who advises Ansar Allah told us
that the Houthis "will not be puppets of Iran."]{.underline}** Saudi
management of its security needs in Yemen, including the northern border
regions, for decades ran via manipulation of Yemen's tribes. Riyadh
turned increasingly towards Saleh's Sana'a in the last decade,
neglecting tribal largesse as a tool and creating a vacuum into which
instability in the north flowed. Saudi Arabia is likely to aim to keep a
more hands-on approach to Yemen post-conflict than the Houthis might
find acceptable, but [this too is an area ripe for creative direct
diplomacy that intertwines economic support, security arrangements in
the border areas, and political/religious recognition]{.underline}. What
Iran Wants and Has to Offer As in other turbulent parts of the Arab
Middle East, Iran identified an opportunity early on in Yemen --- well
before the current war --- and boldly capitalized on it, creating a
national security nightmare in the backyard of its regional arch foe,
Saudi Arabia --- and all for a pittance. While Iran's interest in Yemen
(never a tier-one national security priority like Iraq or Syria) has
grown, wh[at Tehran has to offer the Houthis remains limited --- if
potent --- when measured against core Houthi interests. Tehran's ability
to substantially increase its non-military assistance is limited by
Iran's own economic travails under U.S. sanctions]{.underline}. [Tehran
cannot address the issue of Houthi quests for recognition, security, or
equanimous border relations and trade with Saudi Arabia]{.underline}.
**[Those who know the Houthis have told us the Ansar Allah leadership
might well consider curbing ties with Iran for an alternative
arrangement, in part because they have a highly transactional
perspective towards assistance]{.underline}**. **[Iran also does not
appear to control Houthi decision-making.]{.underline}** [Close
observers]{.underline} we spoke to [note]{.underline} that Abdul Malik
al-Houthi and his [military commanders often ignore Iran's advice. For
example, the Houthis moved to take Sana'a in September 2014 against
Tehran's counsel]{.underline}. [The Houthis' antipathy to foreign
intervention limits the depth of any external relationships as
well.]{.underline} [The Houthi leadership]{.underline} [has]{.underline}
occasionally [lobbed criticism]{.underline} when Tehran appeared to
exceed its brief, harshly [condemning an Iranian military official's
statement in 2016 suggesting Iran might acquire a naval base in
Yemen]{.underline} and a comment by an Iranian Majlis member in 2014
that Sana'a had become "the fourth" regional capital under Iranian
influence. [In the latter case, the Houthis termed the comment "as
provocative to us as it was for the Gulf \[states]{.underline}\]" in a
2016 interview. In short, **[the relationship, although indisputably
deepened as a result of Iran's military assistance and the sheer length
of the conflict, remains an alliance of convenience for the
Houthis]{.underline}**. The Strategy and the Pitfalls The radical
worldview of the Houthis --- who see Israel, Jews, and the United States
as regional destabilizers, enemies of Islam, and the ultimate puppeteers
of Arab regimes --- is unlikely to change anytime soon. It is also this
political ideology that creates a political --- rather than religious
--- affinity for them with Iran. However, [part of the movement
and]{.underline} likely [its leadership understands that a **political
accommodation with the great neighbor across the border is far more
beneficial for the community's ultimate survival** **than a relationship
with a partner of convenience**, physically distant and with few
non-military resources to offer.]{.underline} Just as radicalization
experts draw a sharp distinction between deradicalizing (change of
worldview) and disengaging (change of behavior), [changing Houthi
behavior through a robust mix of incentives is a more viable aim than
changing the Houthi worldview]{.underline}. [Substantive direct talks
with well-defined parameters is possible]{.underline}, however. Indeed,
**[such a diplomatic gambit worked in 2016 when Saudi intelligence
officials and the Houthis talked directly and agreed to a
de-escalation]{.underline}**. [The Houthis even went so far as to issue
a condemnation of Iran to seal the deal]{.underline}. This effort was
effective but short-lived. [Two lessons from this earlier venture remain
germane for another go]{.underline}: First, Hadi acted as a spoiler
then, learning of the Saudi-Houthi talks only after they had taken place
and perceiving them as a threat to his position. Second, the
Saudi-Houthi agreement was linked at the time to U.N.-led intra-Yemeni
talks; the collapse of those talks soured the Saudi-Houthi channel.
Anticipating such potential pitfalls will be key to avoiding a replay.
[A U.N. contact told us the de-escalation committees established in 2016
still exist and could be re-operationalized in short order. That would
be a good start]{.underline}. **[Riyadh should have learned already from
previous short-lived efforts not to underestimate Houthi negotiating
prowess]{.underline}**. Foreign observers often note the group's lack of
international exposure, diplomatic inexperience, and its youthful
leaders --- but [the House of Saud was underestimated in much the same
way by outsiders in the early days of the modern Saudi
state.]{.underline} **[The common refrain that the Houthis are
politically unsophisticated also fails to take into account the
movement's very hard-nosed understanding of how power in Yemen
works]{.underline}** (as well as any tutoring Iran is providing). As
sada, or descendants of the Prophet Muhammad, [the Houthis come from a
long line of arbitrators in north Yemen]{.underline}. [They thus have at
their disposal]{.underline} --- if they choose --- [the honed tools of
northern Yemeni diplomacy: mediation, dialogue, and
compromise]{.underline}. The Urgency of a Direct and Focused Back
Channel Martin Griffith's success in December in gaining the commitment
of the Houthis, the Hadi government, and the Saudi-led coalition to a
set of preliminary confidence-building measures was avidly welcomed by
the international community. The fragility of such carefully and
deliberately crafted works of opacity is becoming clear on the ground,
however. [The U.N. special envoy's work is a start, but a different kind
of confidence-building measure is critically important at this juncture:
**a direct and high-level Saudi-Houthi back channel to reinforce the
United Nations' work.**]{.underline} [A Saudi-led diplomatic maneuver to
coopt the Houthis would offer a much-needed, face-saving way to end this
disastrous war at a time when strategic thinking is at an all-time low
in the region.]{.underline} [Only Riyadh is in a position to undertake
such a venture, and with ample leverage to wield]{.underline}. **[And
the incentive? A different kind of victory --- one that has proven
altogether elusive on the battlefield: reorienting the Houthis away from
their current ally, Tehran]{.underline}**. [A Saudi leader who launched
an intervention to check Iran's inroads]{.underline} on the Arabian
Peninsula, but ironically has seen that influence deepen in the course
of the conflict, [has a far better chance of achieving that goal via a
direct channel with the Houthi leadership]{.underline}. [Such talks can
both offer traction to and levy the pressures of U.N.-led,
internationally supported peace negotiations, cutting the Houthis down
to size politically to just another (albeit noisy) political actor in a
collection of such actors deliberating over the shape of Yemen's
post-conflict governance.]{.underline}

and track II diplomacy strategies that can---and do---help guide efforts
to bring Yemen's warring parties to the table]{.underline}**. To begin,
the UN [envoy could make greater use of shuttle diplomacy]{.underline},
as was utilized during negotiations in the former Yugoslavia. When the
Houthis were required to transport themselves to Geneva, peace talks
stalled. Conversely, [when Griffith traveled directly to the
Houthis]{.underline} in Sana'a, [they made progress, signing a six-month
agreement for airlift transports]{.underline} of critically ill
individuals abroad. By **[traveling directly to the parties, the envoy
absorbs the security risk and increases his ability to connect with the
groups]{.underline}**. While the next round of talks is slated to be in
Sweden, the envoy should consider traveling to Yemen for follow up talks
or back-channel negotiations. UN [negotiators can also open additional
lines of communication, either by establishing safe zones]{.underline}
where the negotiating team can securely operate in-country, [or by
garnering the support of respected, non-combatant elders]{.underline}
from factions not directly involved in the conflict who can function as
proxies during talks. Later, when there is enough trust for longer talks
to occur outside of the parties' home bases, UN [mediators should
encourage the parties to appoint a second tier of leaders that can
travel to external locations and negotiate on the core leaders'
behalf]{.underline}. **[The likelihood of successful negotiations would
also increase substantially with the implementation of
confidence-building measures designed to establish trust]{.underline}**
between the warring parties and the UN envoy. [These measures, which
were critical to the Northern Ireland peace process]{.underline}, [may
include aid deliveries, prisoner swaps, promises of financial assistance
in reconstruction efforts, or an airlift for injured
personnel]{.underline}, such as the Houthi evacuation Saudi Arabia
confirmed it would allow on November 12. **[As trust is built, it will
be easier to establish a cessation of hostilities, which in turn can be
leveraged into a partial ceasefire]{.underline}**. [Although a
nation-wide ceasefire is the ultimate goal, all parties should be
willing to accept partial and rolling ceasefires as a stop-gap
measure]{.underline}. **[These establish a degree of normalcy for
civilian populations in most of the country and serve as initial steps
toward a more robust security agreement]{.underline}**. Achieving a
comprehensive agreement is a daunting task, but there are two framing
principles that can help warring parties visualize the zone of
agreement: the best alternative to a negotiated agreement (BATNA) and
the delineation of each parties' points of no compromise (red lines). A
productive negotiation will find options that are better than each
party's BATNA, the range of which is expanded by loosening each side's
red lines. As applied to Yemen's civil war, [this framing tool urges
negotiators to focus on political solutions that either balance power
without requiring the Houthis or the coalition-backed government to
forfeit critical interests (finding space between the red]{.underline}
[lines]{.underline}) [or set up a system with incentives for the parties
to]{.underline} compromise (loosening their red lines). For example,
**[if the government's best alternative is a military attack on
Hodeidah, and the Houthis' red line is losing the port of Hodeidah, the
negotiator will work to create an alternative where both sides'
interests in Hodeidah are satisfied]{.underline}**. [In this scenario,
the government would not feel the need to continue the offensive, and
the Houthis would not lose all access to the port]{.underline}. However,
[security arrangements in Yemen will not be durable without the creation
and acceptance of a new political order in which power is
shared]{.underline}---and it cannot be won at gunpoint. Therefore, [any
framework for negotiation will focus heavily on visualizing political
power-sharing arrangements]{.underline}. At its core, the peace process
will be about figuring out who gets what, when, where, how, and why.
Yemen has a unique advantage here. [The National Dialogues that occurred
over 2013 and 2014 codified an understanding of what Yemeni civilians
hoped for in a post-war Yemen.]{.underline} **[This platform can be
utilized as a foundation for constructing durable post-conflict
arrangements]{.underline}**. Finally, negotiators may be hesitant to
introduce calls for accountability into the process, fearing that this
may disincentivize parties from coming to the table. It is critical,
however, that the parties are aware of the ramifications of their
behavior in the battlefield. Even if precise transitional justice
mechanisms---whether a tribunal, international court, or otherwise---are
not yet solidified, the parties should realize that all pathways to
peace will come with justice.

#### Starting with Hodeidah solves the humanitarian crisis in the short term but back-channels and US leverage get both sides to say yes

<https://www.cfr.org/blog/yemens-long-road-peace>) mba-alb

After more than three years of conflict, the humanitarian consequences
of the war in Yemen are staggering. UN Under-Secretary General for
Humanitarian Affairs Mark Lowcock warned, "There is now a clear and
present danger of an imminent and great big famine engulfing Yemen: much
bigger than anything any professional in this field has encountered
during their working lives." While the road to peace talks will be
difficult and uncertain, [the United States]{.underline} and its allies
and partners [can play an important role in supporting negotiation
efforts and helping the parties find a workable, sustainable solution to
the conflict]{.underline}. Current Prospects for Peace Talks The United
States has provided diplomatic, logistical, and military support to the
Saudi-led coalition since the intervention began in March 2015, but the
U.S. Department of Defense recently announced that it would end the
practice of providing aerial refueling for coalition aircraft,
suggesting that the Donald J. Trump administration is willing to exert
pressure on the coalition to bring them to the negotiating table. On
October 30, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for a ceasefire to
begin within thirty days and Secretary of Defense James Mattis called
for "substantive consultations under the UN Special Envoy" following the
ceasefire--- the strongest and most direct public statements that the
Trump administration had made about the intervention. There has been
little movement on political negotiations in Yemen since 2016, despite
efforts by the UN Special Envoy for the Secretary General to Yemen
Martin Griffiths, who has been shuttling between the parties to engage
in pre-talks aimed at creating a framework for more formal negotiations.
The most recent efforts were scuttled in early September, when the
Houthi delegation failed to attend a meeting in Geneva, claiming that
the United Nations had not met their conditions. Even with added U.S.
pressure on the coalition, and even if the Houthis agree to participate
in person, peace negotiations will likely remain an uphill climb. The
current framework for talks, UN Security Council Resolution 2216, is
largely unworkable because it calls for the Houthis to unilaterally
disarm and withdraw from the territories that they have gained. It also
fails to reflect current, on-the-ground dynamics of the conflict and
does not account for the array of Yemeni stakeholders who could act as
spoilers to any agreement. Likewise, while Pompeo's October 30 statement
was an important step forward, it also called for the Houthis to cease
missile and drone strikes before "Coalition air strikes...cease."
Additionally, the parties remain divided on critical issues. [Saudi
Arabia will need assurances about the security of its southern border
with Yemen and about Houthi ballistic missile capabilities, as well as
the nature of the Houthi's relationship with Iran]{.underline}. Saudi
Crown Prince [M]{.underline}ohammed [b]{.underline}in
[S]{.underline}alman, who served as Saudi Minister of Defense when the
intervention began, [will]{.underline} also [need face-saving measures
in order to win approval from domestic audiences. The
Houthis]{.underline}, in turn, [will want to be reassured that they will
not have to unilaterally disarm]{.underline}, [and will need assurances
that the coalition will stick to a deal---a classic "commitment
problem]{.underline}." The Long Road to Peace [What can the
U]{.underline}nited [States and its partners and allies do to help
overcome these obstacles?]{.underline} Peace talks, now slated for the
end of the year, could take several months, if not longer. In the
interim, [multilateral negotiating efforts should focus on
confidence-building measures among the parties.]{.underline} **[As
access to Hodeidah port, an important point of entry for food and
humanitarian aid, is critical in the short-term for relieving the
humanitarian crisis]{.underline}** **[and looming famine
situation]{.underline}**, [discussions on governance of the city could
help build confidence in the lead-up to more comprehensive
talks.]{.underline} UN Special Envoy Martin Griffith's [proposal from
the summer should be adopted as it would place the port facility under
UN control, allowing humanitarian aid in while also providing additional
assurance to the Saudi-led coalition that Iran cannot use the port for
weapons smuggling]{.underline}. The United States, working with allies
and partners in Europe, can support the UN envoy's efforts to convene
the parties by December 2018 as well. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [**can play a facilitating role by encouraging
back-channel talks between the Saudis, Emiratis, and the Houthis** prior
to and during formal negotiations, since it will be critical to get
Saudi and Emirati buy-in for any viable settlement]{.underline}. U.S**[.
military support to the coalition and arms sales to Saudi Arabia are
also sources of leverage.]{.underline}** In the aftermath of the murder
of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the United States has a window of
opportunity to encourage the Saudis and Emiratis to engage fruitfully
and in good faith. **[Since Saudi Arabia's stated reason for fighting is
to avoid having an Iranian proxy group on its southern border, the
United States should also consider providing military assistance
targeted at increasing border security]{.underline}**. [Additionally,
the United States could support, and encourage partners to support,
continued inspections for goods coming into Yemen via the ongoing United
Nations Verification and Inspection]{.underline} [Mechanism for Yemen to
further reassure the Saudis that Iran is unable to smuggle weapons to
the Houthis]{.underline}. The United Nations or another international
institution could also create inspection and verification measures to
ensure that the Houthis surrender ballistic missiles that could be
launched towards Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates. **[Such
measures would be important to sustaining the peace agreement, and could
additionally help Saudi officials frame the agreement as a victory for
domestic audiences]{.underline}**. **[Once an agreement has been
reached, the United States can employ a combination of carrots and
sticks to overcome the commitment problem that all sides of the conflict
will face]{.underline}**. **[These measures could include positive
inducements like promises of conditional aid and placing international
peacekeeping forces on the ground, to negative inducements like the
threat of sanctions for parties that fail to comply]{.underline}**. The
road to a comprehensive solution to decades of conflict in Yemen is long
and fraught with potential obstacles. However, the international
interest in the region following the Khashoggi murder has created a
critical window for renewed attempts at peace talks. The steps outlined
here will help the United States and international community take
maximal advantage of this opportunity for peace.

"How Saudi Arabia Could Make a Bold Strategic Move on Iran")mba-alb

But it is Saudi Arabia, not the United States, that will bear the costs
of the Iranian response to the U.S. maximum pressure campaign.
[Limiting]{.underline} [how]{.underline} this [escalation]{.underline}
[plays out in]{.underline} Saudi waters and territory [gives the kingdom
a strong incentive for a more pragmatic approach**. It is time for the
Saudis to shift gears by de-escalating their role in the conflict and
trying to prevent a U.S.-Iran war**]{.underline}, **[which would harm
the kingdom and its interests]{.underline}**. The attacks on Saudi ships
in the Gulf and escalating Houthi attacks on Saudi territory are no
coincidence. The Iranian regime has few cards to play to spark
international pressure on the United States to de-escalate, but those it
does have come at Saudi Arabia's expense. Trump administration officials
believe the maximum pressure policy is working, and they expect full
Saudi support, regardless of the consequences. Maximum pressure may
offer some short-term benefits to the kingdom, but the road to war is
long. If the status quo continues, then more Saudi ships may be sunk,
and more Saudi civilians and soldiers may be killed. [The crown prince
said recently, "The Kingdom doesn't want a war in the region." But to
stop one, the Saudi and Iranian governments must talk to each **other.
This might be the first step in a longer incremental process that would
address the threats Iran poses to Saudi Arabia one at a
time**]{.underline}. THE DANGERS OF A FICKLE U.S. PARTNER The United
States cannot blame Saudi Arabia if it chooses to engage. Trump has
repeatedly made overtures to leaders of U.S. antagonists, and Secretary
of State Mike Pompeo even said that the United States is "prepared to
engage in a conversation \[with Iran\] with no preconditions[." A Saudi
step in the same direction would give Riyadh leverage in subsequent
U.S.-Iran negotiations]{.underline}. [The Iranian minister of foreign
affairs]{.underline}, Javad Zarif, [has already suggested a
non-aggression pact with the Gulf states that Saudi Arabia's new friends
in Moscow are ready to facilitate.]{.underline} Even if there is an
all-out war, Trump has proved himself a fickle friend. Trump's Iran
policy is a new testament to his "America First" mentality that sees
allies' security as collateral damage. His position is that other powers
who are more heavily and strategically dependent on oil from the Gulf
should be responsible for preserving their own interests. The United
States will not invest in Gulf security beyond arms sales, unless there
are significant attacks against narrowly defined U.S. interests. And it
would take some serious convincing on Capitol Hill to get the U.S.
Congress to allow military operations in defense of Saudi Arabia, given
many lawmakers' opinions of the kingdom's human rights record. But bold
Saudi diplomacy could enhance Saudi Arabia's reputation on the Hill. ALL
EYES ON THE GULF Saudi Arabia's European and Asian partners are watching
the situation closely. But some may be reluctant to provide significant
assistance to prevent escalation, in the absence of a U.S. security
guarantee. **[Direct talks between Saudi Arabia and Iran to find a safe
exit ramp from the current crisis could patch the credibility of
Riyadh's claims not to want war with Tehran]{.underline}**. Saudi
Arabia's own regional allies would also welcome a new Saudi policy on
Iran with incremental but realistic objectives. [International and
regional support for the kingdom's security becomes more likely if Saudi
Arabia shows credible signs of distancing itself from the current
military escalation]{.underline}. **[Such a shift may also open the door
to an honorable and regionally supported exit from Yemen and a realistic
implementation of the U.S. project of a Middle East Strategic
Alliance]{.underline}**. Saudi Arabia and Iran have attempted this kind
of incremental engagement before. With the exception of the United
States, the countries that signed the Iran nuclear deal are ready to
consider that agreement as a first step toward a comprehensive form of
engagement with Iran that deals with other Iranian threats to Saudi
Arabia and the region one at a time. [Such an incremental approach
provides a next step that the current Trump policy hasn't been able to
supply]{.underline}. Saudi Arabia will pay a steep price for the
U.S.-led campaign against Iran. The kingdom should choose a wiser path
and seek to take its fate into its own hands.

#### UAE pull out makes pressure effective

Coalition Continues to Falter in Yemen"

mba-alb

The [UAE]{.underline} has been [withdrawing]{.underline} some
[forces]{.underline} from the war on Yemen. That has not put an end to
their interference in Yemen by any stretch of the imagination, but it
[represents another setback for the Saudi coalition]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} failed Saudi-led [war]{.underline} on Yemen [continues
to falter]{.underline}. The New York Times reports that Mohammed bin
Salman wants the U.S. to increase its involvement in the war to fill the
gap left by the UAE: Four years later, the war is lodged in a stalemate
and Prince Mohammed's signature fight has become a quagmire, diplomats
and analysts say. A [steep pullout]{.underline} [by]{.underline} his key
ally, the [U]{.underline}nited [A]{.underline}rab
[E]{.underline}mirates, they say, [raises questions about Saudi Arabia's
ability to lead the war on its own.]{.underline} Emboldened by the
hawkish comments of Trump administration officials, Prince Mohammed is
now hoping Washington will help make up the difference with new American
military support, according to diplomats with knowledge of the
conversations. Congress won't support increasing U.S. involvement in a
war that they have repeatedly voted to end, but the president has vetoed
their resolutions and ignored their objections for more than two years.
It remains to be seen whether he would try to escalate our government's
already illegal involvement in this war. To date, Trump has indulged the
Saudi government on practically everything, and he has been echoing
Saudi propaganda on Yemen for so many years that he may actually think
that this has something to do with fighting Iran. It would be difficult
to sell deeper U.S. involvement when even the UAE has decided that the
war in northern Yemen isn't worth fighting. If it isn't important enough
for the UAE, how could it possibly be important enough for the U.S.?
[The war on Yemen wasn't winnable for the Saudi coalition before, and
now with the UAE's pullback it is certain that the coalition can't
prevail: "]{.underline}Saudi Arabia can prevent peace from breaking out
and can bleed the Houthis on a never-ending northern front," Michael
Knights, a researcher at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy,
argued in a report this week. "But only the U.A.E. had the military
potency and local allied forces to credibly threaten defeat for the
Houthis." **[The responsible thing for the U.S. to do is to take
advantage of the Saudi coalition's weakness and use our leverage with
Saudi Arabia to get a general ceasefire and peace
negotiations]{.underline}**. We know the Trump administration won't do
that, but **[that is what would bring the biggest part of the war to a
close]{.underline}**. The [war]{.underline} [has]{.underline} a
catastrophe for Yemen, but it has also [been terrible for Saudi Arabia's
security]{.underline}. [Halting their campaign is the best
way]{.underline} for them [to put an end to]{.underline} missile and
drone [attacks inside their country]{.underline}. **[The longer the
Saudis take to extricate themselves from the mess they created, the
worse it is going to be for them]{.underline}**. **[The U.S. should do
everything it can to urge and push them to get out at
once.]{.underline}** Unfortunately, the administration has been sending
Saudi Arabia the wrong signals. The article mentions that Pompeo was
encouraging the Saudis to press on with the war just a few months ago:
At an American-sponsored conference in Warsaw in February, Mr. Pompeo
bluntly told the Saudis and others that the coalition fighting in Yemen
should kick the stuffing out of the Houthis, one diplomat present said,
although he said Mr. Pompeo used an earthier noun than stuffing. The
diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity to describe a private meeting.
That certainly sounds like Pompeo: gruff, stupid, and bombastic. If that
is representative of how the Trump administration sees the war, we have
to assume that they will put no pressure on Saudi Arabia to end the war
and they may even try to increase the U.S. role. More than four years
after the Saudi coalition intervened in Yemen, they have achieved none
of their stated goals, and they have failed to compel the Houthis to
cede the capital. Abandoning a failed war will be embarrassing for
Mohammed bin Salman, but persisting in an unwinnable quagmire out of
misguided pride is even more humiliating and destructive.

[The conflict in Yemen is unwinnable,]{.underline} dangerous for the
region and remarkably cruel. [So the drawdown of troops by
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [A]{.underline}rab
[E]{.underline}mirates, the biggest outside ground force backing the
Saudi-led intervention that has turned a civil war into a humanitarian
disaster, [should be an example for everyone else involved.]{.underline}
**[Given global revulsion with the Yemen war]{.underline}**, which has
created what the United Nations calls the world's greatest humanitarian
crisis, **[the country's tacit recognition that the conflict is a waste
of lives, resources and national stature is a dose of
sanity]{.underline}**. The United Arab Emirates has not publicly
explained its pullback, evidently for fear of irritating its Saudi
allies. But diplomats say the Emiratis, who sent at least 5,000 troops
to Yemen to train and lead a mélange of pro-government troops and
militias, have wanted out for some time now. They say the United Arab
Emirates has sharply cut its deployment of men, attack helicopters and
heavy guns around the Red Sea port of Hudaydah, the main battleground
last year. A shaky [United Nations]{.underline}-mediated cease-fire in
Hudaydah that came into effect last December provided the excuse and a
reason to pull back. Those [talks]{.underline}, which resumed on Sunday,
o[ffer a potential framework for real peace negotiations if other
combatants --- most important Saudi Arabia, the leader of the coalition
in which the United Arab Emirates had the lead ground role --- followed
the Emirates' lead]{.underline}. The conflict in Yemen is a composite of
many struggles, old and new, local and regional. It traces back to the
Arab Spring, when the ouster of a strongman president led to a rebellion
by northern Houthi rebels. Their southward romp was stopped by a
coalition of Arab states and local militias compiled by Saudi Arabia and
actively assisted by the United States[. With help from Iran, the
Houthis proved too strong for the Saudi-led coalition to defeat, but
they were too weak to take full power]{.underline}. [The conflict became
a proxy struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran]{.underline}. Saudi
bombing turned an already impoverished country into an unlivable one,
with tens of thousands of civilian deaths and extreme shortages of food
and medicine. Houthi atrocities contributed to the horrors. In the
United States, pressure grew on the administration to stop assisting
Saudi Arabia with refueling, intelligence and arms sales. [The pressure
mushroomed after the]{.underline} Saudi murder of the dissident
journalist Jamal [Khashoggi]{.underline} last year and consequent
disenchantment with the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman, the driving force behind the intervention in Yemen.
A bipartisan resolution in Congress in April calling on the
administration to curtail American involvement was vetoed by President
Trump, but the House has now begun a new effort to block the transfer of
munitions to Saudi Arabia. The swelling American disgust with the war
provided further incentive for the United Arab Emirates to distance
itself from the Saudi-led intervention. At the same time, the rising
tensions between the United States and Iran prodded the Emiratis to
bring home troops who would be needed should the saber-rattling escalate
further. The Yemen conflict is bad enough without being embroiled in the
greater power struggle in the Persian Gulf. **[The only solution there
is a negotiated peace agreement among the Yemenis on sharing power and
resources, and Saudi Arabia should seek its own agreement with the
Houthis to end cross-border drone and missile strikes.]{.underline}**
The [agreement]{.underline} mediated [by the United Nations]{.underline}
in December to prevent a devastating battle over Hudaydah leaves a lot
to be desired, but it [does create a platform not only to safeguard
Hudaydah but also to start negotiating a full cease-fire and peace
agreement]{.underline}. **[The Emirati withdrawal from the port should
be a major step toward encouraging the Yemenis to start focusing on how
they can end the war destroying their land.]{.underline}** **[The
withdrawal could also be the impetus for the Trump administration to
start being part of the solution to the war,]{.underline}** not an
enabler, **[pointing the way for Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**, the
internationally recognized government of Yemen and the Houthi rebels to
follow suit. **[The means are there]{.underline}**. This week,
representatives of the Houthis and the government met under United
Nations auspices on a ship in international waters to continue
discussions on Hudaydah. **[With a dollop of the realism the Emiratis
have provided, these could quickly become broader talks on the peace
Yemen so desperately needs.]{.underline}**

[The latest round of]{.underline} U.N.-mediated [peace
talks]{.underline} over Yemen\'s civil war [has fallen
apart]{.underline}. The conflict\'s principal parties --- the
internationally recognized government of President Abd Rabboh Mansour
Hadi and the insurgent Houthi militia --- failed even to meet at the
negotiations in Geneva. Instead, they will return to the battlefield to
try to settle their differences. That\'s unwelcome news for many of the
parties involved. In the short term, [the two sides of the conflict will
try to gain from more fighting]{.underline}. In the long term, [however,
the war\'s protraction will jeopardize the interests of the government
and the rebels alike]{.underline}. It will also cast doubt on the
military and diplomatic reputations of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates, which lead the international coalition against the Houthis,
and put the United States\' fight against extremists in Yemen on the
back burner. But for Iran and jihadist groups such as al-Qaeda and the
nascent Yemeni Islamic State, the continued conflict will present an
opportunity. Another Try, Another Failure [The prospects for success in
the latest discussions were dim]{.underline}; the previous round of
peace talks, held in 2016 in Kuwait, also fizzled before they got
underway. This time, the U.N. special envoy who organized the talks,
Martin Griffiths, believed that, with a more modest goal in mind than a
comprehensive peace deal, another round of negotiations could make
progress. Griffiths planned to steer the new talks toward specific
objectives, such as unifying Yemen\'s central bank and arranging
prisoner swaps, in an effort to encourage engagement. The humanitarian
costs of Yemen\'s civil war -- which has caused food shortages,
increased the strain on local water supplies, opened the way to
devastating disease outbreaks and destroyed the country\'s economy --
were simply too high not to try again. But [neither the Houthis nor the
Hadi government had much to gain from the talks]{.underline}, and Saudi
Arabia and its coalition allies merely went through the motions to
demonstrate their commitment to peace to the United States and other key
defense suppliers. A[s a result, the talks fell apart before they even
started]{.underline}. [The latest failure doesn\'t mean that attempts at
negotiation will stop altogether]{.underline}. **[After all, the warring
parties will be hard-pressed to find a military solution to end the
conflict]{.underline}**. [It does mean]{.underline}, however, that [both
sides will return to the battlefield]{.underline} for now [to try to
gain an advantage]{.underline} [for the next round of
talks]{.underline}, and, in the meantime, to weaken their opponent. In
exchange for playing along with the peace talks, the Saudi-led coalition
will now have more diplomatic leeway for an offensive to take
al-Hudaydah, Yemen\'s largest port, where Emirati and allied forces are
already well-positioned for a push. The Houthis, in turn, will stand
their ground, hoping to inflict enough damage on the coalition to wear
it out. They will also continue to threaten missile attacks on Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and international shipping activity in
the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, while waiting for the international
community to rethink its support for the coalition. Bringing the War
Home [As the conflict drags on, Yemen\'s humanitarian crisis is turning
official opinion in the United States and Europe against the
war]{.underline}. Norway banned weapons sales to the Saudi coalition
earlier this year. Germany has barred new defense contracts to all
countries involved in the Yemen conflict -- and that was before the
coalition bombed a school bus in August, heightening international
concerns about its tactics. The civilian death toll in Yemen also
prompted Spain to waver on a deal to sell hundreds of precision bombs to
Saudi Arabia, though it announced Sept. 13 that it would proceed with
the delivery. And for the coalition and Houthis alike, a U.N. report
detailing the war crimes that each side has committed could reduce
international support. [In light of the increased scrutiny, the
coalition leaders will have to carefully weigh their military strategy
in Yemen against the attitudes of their Western]{.underline}
[allies]{.underline}, namely the United States. The approach of
congressional midterm elections, in particular, could rally lawmakers to
move to change the U.S. stance on the Yemeni conflict, an issue that has
drawn bipartisan support in Washington. Although the United States will
continue to back the Saudi-led coalition mission to restore Hadi\'s
authority, Congress may push the Yemeni government and its foreign
allies to compromise with the Houthis to alleviate the humanitarian
crisis. **[At home, too, Saudi and Emirati leaders may find support for
their campaign in Yemen waning]{.underline}**. Saudi Crown Prince
[M]{.underline}ohammed [b]{.underline}in [S]{.underline}alman\'s
[military and diplomatic prowess could come into question]{.underline}
[among the royal family if he fails to bring a decisive end to Yemen\'s
war]{.underline} -- [and to the kingdom\'s costly involvement in
it]{.underline}. Though at less risk than Mohammed bin Salman,
[UAE]{.underline} Emir Mohammed bin Zayed [could find himself on the
wrong side of public opinion]{.underline} [if]{.underline} [the
U]{.underline}nited [A]{.underline}rab [E]{.underline}mirates [continues
its role in the conflict]{.underline}, especially as the Houthis have
threatened to attack his country. The group has already spread false
reports of strikes on airports in Abu Dhabi and Dubai in an effort to
disturb citizens and international businesses in the country and disrupt
the country\'s vital tourism industry. **[The Houthis]{.underline}**,

Iran's support for the Houthi movement in northern Yemen follows a sound

loyalty]{.underline}. **[The U]{.underline}**nited
**[St]{.underline}**ates **[and its partners might still be able to
reverse Iran's pull on the Houthis]{.underline}**. Iran has cultivated
the Houthis as part of Tehran's effort to expand its regional influence
through what it calls the Axis of Resistance. [This Axis describes an
informal Iran-led alliance of state and non-state actors opposed to
Western and Israeli influence in the Middle East, as well as to
America's Arab partners]{.underline}. Members include Iran, Syria,
Lebanese Hezbollah, and some Iraqi Shiite militias. Iranian officials
now list the Houthi movement among other partners, and Houthi
delegations have met regularly with others within the Axis of
Resistance. Iran leverages this alliance to pursue objectives that
include expelling the United States from the Middle East and
establishing Iranian regional hegemony. A limited investment in Yemen
has yielded outsized influence for Iran on the Arabian Peninsula and in
the Red Sea. [Iran has provided the Houthis with media, political,
diplomatic, materiel, and humanitarian support]{.underline}. Critically,
[Iran has transferred asymmetric military capabilities to the Houthis
that have enabled them to threaten Riyadh \-- and possibly Abu Dhabi \--
as well as to disrupt commercial naval traffic in the Red
Sea]{.underline}. [Iran has also built indigenous capacity within Yemen
to produce improvised explosive devices that could disrupt advances
against the Houthis in the coming phases of the civil war.]{.underline}
Iran has used the threat from the Houthis to pull Saudi focus from other
theaters such as Syria back to Yemen, and to distract from Iranian gains
elsewhere in the region. **[It is far from a given, however, that the
Houthis respond to commands from Tehran]{.underline}**. **[The Houthi
movement is not under Iranian control yet, and it will not take actions
in Iran's interest that run against its own.]{.underline}** The Houthis
probably remain more important to Iran than Iran is to the Houthis. The
movement itself is not a monolith, and **[many of the
supporters]{.underline}** who joined the Houthis over the course of the
civil war **[would probably reject Iranian outreach and possibly break
from the Houthis themselves if they perceived a better way to secure
their future]{.underline}**. It is not clear where the core Houthi
leadership stands on the Iran question. **[Separating the movement from
Tehran will grow more difficult as time passes, but it is not
impossible]{.underline}**. Interdicting the flow of Iranian materiel
into Yemen could limit the Houthis' asymmetrical attack capabilities \--
though it would not eliminate those threats. The group's longer-range
ballistic missile attacks from Yemen into Saudi Arabia used weapons
sourced in Iran. Tehran has also provided unmanned aerial vehicles to
the Houthis, and it is not clear that these can be produced in Yemen.
But [the Houthis should be able to sustain shorter-range missile
attacks, naval attacks, and landmine and IED attacks without Iranian
support]{.underline}. These attacks are critical to the Houthis' defense
in Yemen. **[The Houthis' wartime requirements will continue to drive
the movement closer to Iran.]{.underline}** **[To interrupt that
relationship, the United States could start by leading a diplomatic
effort to resolve the underlying causes of Yemen's civil
war.]{.underline}** The Houthis rejected the last Yemeni National
Dialogue Conference, in 2014 -- but so did many in Yemen's south. They
saw the outcome as painting a veneer of reform over the power structures
that support elite interests. Critically, the Conference failed to
produce an acceptable solution to how the Yemeni government would
decentralize and how national resources would be distributed. The
proposed six-region solution, and the manner by which this solution was
reached, delegitimized the NDC process for some members of the
opposition, including the Houthis. U.S. statements continue to call for
Yemenis to respect the outcomes of the Conference. This ignores the
protests of the Houthis and of Yemen's Southern Movement, al-Hirak,
against these outcomes. Current UN-led efforts leave the dispute
unresolved. The United States and its partners might recognize the
failures of the NDC and work to produce solutions acceptable to all
Yemenis. Washington should also encourage partners to develop or restore
relationships with individuals who have chosen to support the Houthis
politically during the civil war but who might not entirely believe in
their cause. Houthi adherents might include members of the former ruling
party still in northern Yemen and northern-based families and tribes who
have calculated that their political prospects and futures were better
with the Houthis than with the loose-knit coalition opposing them.
Splintering the Houthi movement in this fashion could begin to diminish
the group's influence in Yemen. Reducing the Houthis' strengths would
increase the prospects of an acceptable negotiated settlement to the war
and a political resolution in Yemen.

Deadlocked? Think Again."
<https://the-brief.co/is-the-yemen-war-really-deadlocked-think-again/>)

It has become a cliché to say that the war in Yemen has reached a point
of military deadlock. Rebel forces led by the Houthi clan control the
capital Sanaa, the country's largest port Hodeidah, and they have a
proven track record of slowing down the advances of the Yemeni
government and the Saudi-led coalition. That being said, the [Houthis
have lost a lot of ground since the apex of their territorial control in
the spring of 2015]{.underline}, [when]{.underline} [they]{.underline}
also [controlled Aden and Taizz, the]{.underline} second and third
largest cities in Yemen, the legendary Marib Dam, and Yemen's entire Red
Sea coast[. In the last three years, the Yemeni military and the
coalition liberated Aden, Marib Dam, much of Taizz, the Bab el-Mandab
Strait and half of Yemen's 420 kilometer Red Sea coast,]{.underline} [in
addition to driving]{.underline} al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula
([AQAP) out of Mukalla city, nearby ports and Yemen's key energy export
pipeline corridors.]{.underline} "The next coalition gain is likely to
be the ports of Hodeidah and Saleef, plus the remainder of the Red Sea
coastal plain" [The next coalition gain is likely to be the ports of
Hodeidah and Saleef, plus the remainder of the Red Sea coastal
plain]{.underline}. [The fight wil]{.underline}l be tough, because the
Houthis know that the loss of the coast [will leave them
landlocked]{.underline} [for the first time]{.underline}
[since]{.underline} they seized control of the Red Sea port of Midi in
[2011]{.underline}. **[Having an opening to the sea
allowed]{.underline}** **[the Houthi]{.underline}** militia Ansar Allah
**[to acquire modern]{.underline}** armaments and training from Iran and
Lebanese Hezbollah, including Iranian-manufactured Qiam 1 medium-range
ballistic missiles capable of striking Riyadh. While the Houthi defense
will be strong, [their forces in Hodeidah are heavily outnumbered by
advancing Yemeni and coalition troops]{.underline}, [and
locally-recruited Houthi allies are likely to flip sides as the Houthis
lose terrain]{.underline}. Already, UAE-backed Yemeni brigades are
wrapping around the northeastern quarter of Hodeidah city, placing them
within striking distance of the port and the last road through which the
Houthis can draw reinforcements or escape. If Hodeidah is liberated this
year, as seems likely, the question is then whether the war has reached
a point of equilibrium, with the south, east and west liberated, while
the Houthis remain quite capable of defending the northern highlands and
Sanaa. When visiting the Nihm front in March this year, I GPS'd my
position just 38.9 kilometers outside the US Embassy in Sanaa. But this
last stretch is the longest, because the Yemeni military lacks the
numbers or the cohesion to assault the capital. The Houthis have no
incentive to bargain away their control of Sanaa in UN-brokered talks,
and will likely value the capital even more highly if they lose control
of their coastline. It could take years for the Yemeni military -- split
between loyalists of the late Ali Abdullah Saleh and pro-Muslim
Brotherhood Islah Party members -- to build the capabilities and unity
needed to assault Sanaa. In the meantime, there is one other option for
the Saudi-led coalition. This is a direct assault on Saada, the
heartland of the Houthi clan, and it has arguably already begun. On the
northwestern side of Saada, Saudi Arabian forces are penetrating Al
Malahidh district in the foothills of the Marran Mountains, the Houthi
stronghold facing the Jizan province, placing them 60 kilometers from
Saada. To the northeast of Saada, Yemeni and Sudanese forces backed by
the coalition are 20 kilometers from Kitaf, a town 50 kilometers from
Saada that Saudi-backed Salafis view as a spiritual center. To the south
of Saada, two coalition thrusts are slowly pushing from the west and
east to cut Saada off from Sanaa -- one group of Saudi-backed Yemeni and
Sudanese forces coming from the coastal plain and one Yemeni front
coming from the east, striking out from Al Maton district in Al Jawf
province. Though coalition progress is slow and costly on these fronts,
Saudi Arabia feels it has plenty of time and more than enough forces to
continue gaining ground in Saada **[province. If the Houthis are cut off
from Iranian resupply, and begin to suffer rolling defections, the rate
of advance could increase]{.underline}**. [Saudi Arabia has quietly
ramped up its direct contribution]{.underline}, deploying large elements
of six Saudi Arabian National Guard and Royal Saudi Land Forces brigades
into Saada. Riyadh is also replacing Yemeni battlefield losses in
armored vehicles directly from Saudi Arabia's mammoth equipment
reserves. As importantly, some of the most experienced Salafi fighters
in Yemen, currently serving in large numbers on the Hodeidah front, are
likely to be released for operations on the Kitaf front soon, where many
of them fought the Houthis in 2004-2014. "Saudi Arabia feels it has
plenty of time and more than enough forces to continue gaining ground in
Saada province" The Gulf coalition believes that the Houthis currently
have no incentive to withdraw from Hodeidah or Sanaa, which was
graphically demonstrated when they failed to show up at the Geneva peace
talks this month. This assessment is probably correct. For hardliners
within the Houthi leadership, any agreement will probably result in them
losing their current dominance in Sanaa and on the Red Sea coast. [The
coalition is likely to keep pushing militarily in order to shift this
calculus.]{.underline} For Saudi Arabia, it is preferable to support a
multi-year, or even multi-decade, war of attrition rather than let a
southern Hezbollah establish itself on the Red Sea. The war may be
deadlocked this year, but neither the Houthis nor Riyadh have short-term
agendas in Yemen.

No one in his right mind thinks it will benefit Saudi Arabia or the
United States to extend the war longer than necessary. The United States
has rightly thrown its weight behind U.N.-mediated peace negotiations,
though the Houthis [did not bother to turn
up](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-un/yemen-peace-talks-collapse-in-geneva-after-houthi-no-show-idUSKCN1LO08Z)
to the long-awaited first round of talks commenced in Geneva last week.
However, for all the horror of the Yemen war, [it is vitally
important]{.underline} [that]{.underline} U.S. policymakers and
[legislators do not lose sight of the strategic outcome the
war]{.underline} [was intended to avert --- namely, the establishment of
an Iranian-supplied "southern Hezbollah" on the Arabian Peninsula,
flanking the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and Suez Canal and posing a new
missile threat to Saudi Arabia and Israel]{.underline}. I visited the
Yemeni battlefronts on three research visits to Yemen this year and
interviewed dozens of Yemeni and Gulf coalition officers, intelligence
officials, leaders and civilians about what they have learned about the
Houthis as an adversary. This included Yemenis who lived under Houthi
rule, or were inducted as child soldiers in their militia, and a range
of Yemen experts who have direct, ongoing relations with Houthi leaders.
[The research, [published](https://ctc.usma.edu/september-2018/) by the
Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, paints a graphic picture of a
movement that is more ambitious]{.underline} --- [and more hostile to
U.S. interests --- than is widely understood]{.underline}. The sharp
increase in Houthi military power and ambition was the result of not
only their capture of Yemeni state arsenals after the Arab Spring
protests in 2011, but was also an increase in Iranian and Lebanese
Hezbollah military assistance. In less than five years, the Houthis
transitioned from launching guerrilla raids in their native mountain
provinces to mounting 180-mile, long-range offensives and lobbing
Iranian-made, [medium-range ballistic
missiles](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-security/iran-aligned-houthis-in-yemen-fire-missiles-at-saudi-capital-idUSKBN1IA100)
at Riyadh. They didn't do this alone: Houthi fighters are good, but
they're not that good and they're certainly no rocket scientists. [The
Houthis aren't yet an Iranian-controlled proxy but Iran's current level
of influence with the movement easily could grow in future
years]{.underline} --- [particularly if Tehran can covertly send arms
via a Houthi-controlled Red Sea coastline or unmonitored air
transportation]{.underline}. The United Nations [has
stated](https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/letter-dated-26-january-2018-panel-experts-yemen-mandated-security-council-resolution)
that the Houthis are using Iranian-provided ballistic missiles and
drones, and investigations are under way that Iran also provided
anti-shipping weapons and surface-to-air missiles[. If the international
arms embargo is relaxed, Iran could provide years' worth of ballistic
missiles capable of hitting Riyadh in just a few shiploads via any of
the three Red Sea ports currently under their control]{.underline}. The
Houthis are largely known outside Yemen as the victims of Saudi
airstrikes, but for over 15 years, at every major event, they have
[chanted the
slogan](http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-death-to-america-death-to-israel-say-houthis-in-yemen-20150220-story.html):
"Death to America, death to Israel, curse upon the Jews, victory to
Islam!" [Their anti-American, anti-Western and anti-Israeli worldview is
closely aligned with the other "[Axis of
Resistance](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/world-report/articles/2018-02-23/irans-axis-of-resistance-is-a-direct-threat-to-the-us)"
actors such as Iran, Lebanese Hezbollah and the Iranian-backed militias
in Iraq.]{.underline} The Houthis were not pushed into this axis by the
current war: they adopted their slogan in 2000 and started the current
war in 2015, after four years of intense preparation, aided and
encouraged by Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah. **[All this means that the
war must end, but it should not end with a "southern Hezbollah" on the
Red Sea to match the northern Hezbollah on the
Mediterranean]{.underline}**. Of course, the United States should do its
best to end the war and to force Gulf coalition partners to fight
cleanly in the meantime. Yet U.S. strategic interests require that any
U.N.-brokered peace deal does not end with Houthi-controlled coastline
on the Red Sea, or direct uninspected flights landing in Houthi areas.
[The United States should commit to open-ended support to maritime
interdiction of Iranian arms shipments to Yemen, such as the weapons
[interdicted by a U.S. Navy
destroyer](https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-navy-seized-1000-ak-47-rifles-boat/story?id=57505601)
on Aug. 28]{.underline}. If the United States, Israel and Europe could
go back in time and prevent Hezbollah from becoming a powerhouse, they
would do so in a heartbeat. This is the fleeting opportunity that still
remains in Yemen.

Yemen, a failed state embroiled in a bitter civil war, has become
infested with terrorist groups and multiple overlapping insurgencies.
The [chaos has allowed]{.underline} Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula
([AQAP) to flourish]{.underline} and develop into one of the most potent
terrorist threats to the United States. The [paramount U.S. national
security interest]{.underline} in Yemen [is to defeat AQAP while
backing]{.underline} Arab [efforts to support]{.underline} the
internationally recognized [Yemeni government]{.underline}, which is
more focused on battling Iranian-supported Houthi rebels than it is on
AQAP. Washington also should work to contain Iranian influence in Yemen,
but that is more likely to come through a political settlement that
tamps down the fighting than it is through an unlikely military victory
by the weak Yemeni government and its Arab allies. Dancing on the Heads
of Snakes Yemen's government, undermined in 2011 by Arab Spring protests
against corruption and poor governance, dissolved into warring factions
and attracted the intervention of rival foreign powers. Former President
Ali Abdullah Saleh, who once said that ruling Yemen is "like dancing on
the heads of snakes," was forced out of power by protests in 2012. He
then joined with Iran-backed Houthi rebels, which his government had
been fighting on and off since 2004, to overthrow his successor, Abed
Rabbo Mansour Hadi, and seize Yemen's capital, Sanaa, in September 2014.
Hadi fled to Saudi Arabia and returned to Yemen with the support of an
Arab military coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) in 2015. While the UAE has led an effective and realistic campaign
against AQAP in southern Yemen, Saudi Arabia has had much less success
in pushing back Houthi--Saleh forces from the mountainous territory they
seized in central and western Yemen. The Saudi-led campaign there has
bogged down in a stalemate. More than 10,000 Yemenis have died in the
fighting, and a humanitarian catastrophe is brewing, with over 60
percent of Yemenis---more than 17 million people---estimated to be at
risk of starvation. Yemen, Osama bin Laden's ancestral homeland, has
long been a hotbed of Islamist extremism and support for al-Qaeda.
Al-Qaeda's first terrorist attack against Americans occurred in Yemen in
December 1992, and it launched a devastating attack in Yemen in October
2000 when it bombed the USS Cole in the port of Aden, killing 17
American sailors. AQAP has pioneered the use of sophisticated bombs that
are difficult to detect, such as the one used by the so-called underwear
bomber who tried but failed to explode a bomb in an airliner over
Detroit on Christmas day in 2009. AQAP's bomb-making expertise has
prompted stronger security precautions on commercial airliners, and the
organization remains one of the world's most dangerous terrorist
groups.2 Thomas Joscelyn, "What's Really Behind Trump's Laptop Ban,"

http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/03/whats-really-behind-trumps-laptop-ban-214943
(accessed June 5, 2017). A U.S. Policy for the Yemeni Snake Pit Yemen's
civil war has created an increasingly permissive environment for
Islamist terrorist groups, similar to civil wars in Libya, Syria, and
Somalia. The Administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack
Obama worked with Saleh's government to encourage it to take a more
confrontational position against al-Qaeda. American special operations
forces trained elite Yemeni counterterrorism forces, but that ended
after the collapse of the Yemeni government. After the 2015 Saudi-led
intervention, the Obama Administration provided intelligence, logistical
support, and aerial refueling for the Arab coalition forces, but the
White House froze the transfer of precision-guided munitions and pulled
back on intelligence support after the Saudi air campaign was criticized
for causing heavy civilian casualties. The Trump administration lifted
the freeze on munitions and announced a new round of arms sales to Saudi
Arabia during President Donald Trump's recent visit there. While the
Obama Administration pulled back on U.S. air and drone strikes against
AQAP, the Trump Administration has expanded the campaign to include the
targeting of mid-level leaders of its guerrilla army. The Pentagon
launched a special operations raid against an AQAP compound in central
Yemen on January 29 as well as at least one other raid in May, the first
reported operations involving U.S. troops since 2014. [To maintain the
pressure on AQAP and address other security concerns stemming from
Yemen's]{.underline} complex, multisided [war, Washington
should]{.underline}: **[Make the defeat of AQAP the top U.S.
priority.]{.underline}** The [Trump Administration should escalate air
strikes, drone strikes, and special operations raids against AQAP
leaders]{.underline} [while working to shape a less permissive
environment for transnational terrorists]{.underline}. **[It should
provide enhanced training to Saudi, UAE, and Yemeni counterterrorism
forces and cooperate closely with them in targeting AQAP]{.underline}**.
[Military efforts,]{.underline} however, [must be reinforced with
soft-power efforts to reshape Yemen's political
environment]{.underline}. [The Yemeni]{.underline}
[government]{.underline} [has]{.underline} tacitly [cooperated with
AQAP]{.underline} to battle southern secessionists and Houthi--Saleh
forces. For example, AQAP plays an important role in fighting Houthi
forces in Taiz city in central Yemen and has operated in close
coordination with the Abu Abbas brigade, a Salafi militia backed by the
Arab coalition. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should
use carrots and sticks to discourage covert government cooperation with
AQAP and encourage tribal opposition to AQAP]{.underline}. For example,
tribes in Shabwah governorate in eastern Yemen mobilized against AQAP to
prevent U.S. air strikes on tribal territory. Washington should also
work with Saudi Arabia and the UAE to twist Yemen's tribal kaleidoscope
in a more favorable direction. [The CIA should coordinate efforts to
reach out to tribal leaders and provide financial inducements to turn
them against AQAP]{.underline}, [which has benefitted from their
frequent unwillingness to support the Yemeni government against
it.]{.underline}

Crescent is not political but it is actually an economic crescent, as
Shias hold 80 per cent of the world's oil in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia,
Yemen, Iraq, Syria and Iran]{.underline}." **[Without understanding this
core reason behind the Houthi offensive, achieving peace in Yemen is
nigh on impossible -- any plan to end the war without putting more
pressure on Iran to dismantle its Quds forces is highly likely to
fail,]{.underline}** as we've seen since the beginning of this conflict.
[Houthis are merely a proxy of the IRGC's Quds forces]{.underline}.
However, now that Iran is under intense pressure by the current US
administration and its own people, it can no longer continue to arm and
sponsor the Houthis like before. Consequently, Houthi rebels have been
pushed to show willingness in negotiations for the time being.
Nevertheless, it is important to remember that [Houthi rebels have
refused to join any peace talks to end the war in Yemen in the
past]{.underline}. According to Kamal Kharrazi, the head of Iran's
Strategic Council on Foreign Relations, Tehran is negotiating with
European countries about the Yemen crisis and, according to Iranian
media, the war was the top priority of the discussion between British
foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt and Iranian officials on Monday. [But from
the Iranian perspective, a ceasefire in Yemen is only crucial for the
time being because it needs to focus on domestic economic challenges as
the country hopes to ease US sanctions]{.underline}. **[It is hard to
imagine they are truly seeking a peaceful resolution to the conflict, as
it remains a key part of their wider regional strategy of expanding
their influence]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[look]{.underline}** **[at
other countries where Iran has sought to impose its influence -- namely
Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, which are extremely divided and
unstable]{.underline}**. [There is little reason to assume Iran's
intentions are different in Yemen]{.underline}. This suggests the [main
reason behind Houthi rebels announcing halting attacks on the Saudi-led
coalition is linked to Iran's current domestic problems,]{.underline}
[as opposed to a genuine willingness to find peace in the
region]{.underline}. **[Yemen is not an isolated war but intrinsically
linked to Iran's wider regional strategy]{.underline}**. [Unless this
aspect begins to be highlighted more insistently, it is difficult to see
any lasting peace in Yemen]{.underline} -- **[a treaty could be signed,
but as Iran faces other problems it could return to destabilising Yemen
because it is a crucial part of Iran's Shia Crescent into Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}**. [It is highly unlikely Iran will stop pursuing
its belligerent efforts to establish its Shia Crescent in the long run
because that is the very essence and purpose of the Islamic regime of
Iran]{.underline}. [This poses a great threat to the stability in the
region, and threatens Saudi Arabia and Bahrain which have significant
Shia population in their countries]{.underline}. In relation to this,
James Mattis, US defence secretary, recently stated that the US has
significant evidence which indicates [Iran has been transferring a
significant amount of weapons into Bahrain. Such evidence is an
indication of how serious Iran's destabilising role in the region is,
and how determined it is to establish a Shia Crescent]{.underline},
which must be taken into consideration by the international community.
[It is crucial to put pressure on Iran to dismantle its Quds forces
because herein lies the key to peace in the region and in
Yemen]{.underline}. **[The wars in the Middle East are part of wider
geopolitical tensions, and Yemen cannot be dealt with in isolation of
the rest of the region's instability]{.underline}**, which the Quds
forces have a lot to answer for.

The Houthi, Iran, and the Bab el Mandab At the same time, the [growing
ties between Yemen's Houthi Shi'ites and Iran poses another threat to
both Saudi Arabia and the United States. **It potentially could allow
Iran to outflank the Gulf, and deploy air and naval forces to
Yemen**]{.underline}. This threat still seems limited, but it is
important to note that [Yemen's territory and islands play a critical
role in the security of another global chokepoint at the southeastern
end of the Red Sea called the Bab el Mandab or "gate of
tears."]{.underline} It is critical to note that [far more is involved
than energy:]{.underline} the cost and security of every cargo that goes
through the Suez canal, the [security of U.S. and other allied combat
ships moving through the canal, the economic stability of Egypt, and the
security of Saudi Arabia's key port at Jeddah and major petroleum export
facility outside the Gulf]{.underline}. The
EIA[describes](http://www.eia.gov/countries/analysisbriefs/World_Oil_Transit_Chokepoints/wotc.pdf)
the energy impact of importance of this chokepoint as follows: The Bab
el-Mandeb Strait is a chokepoint between the Horn of Africa and the
Middle East, and it is a strategic link between the Mediterranean Sea
and the Indian Ocean. The strait is located between
[Yemen](http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=YM),
Djibouti, and Eritrea, and connects the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden
and the Arabian Sea. Most exports from the Persian Gulf that transit the
Suez Canal and SUMED Pipeline also pass through Bab el-Mandeb[. An
estimated 3.8 million bbl/d of crude oil and refined petroleum products
flowed through this waterway]{.underline} in 2013 toward Europe, the
United States, and Asia, an increase from 2.9 million bbl/d in 2009. Oil
shipped through the strait decreased by almost one-third in 2009 because
of the global economic downturn and the decline in northbound oil
shipments to Europe. Northbound oil shipments increased through Bab
el-Mandeb Strait in 2013, and more than half of the traffic, about 2.1
million bbl/d, moved northbound to the Suez Canal and SUMED Pipeline.
The Bab el-Mandeb Strait is 18 miles wide at its narrowest point,
limiting tanker traffic to two 2-mile-wide channels for inbound and
outbound shipments. [Closure of the Bab el-Mandeb could keep tankers
from the Persian Gulf from reaching the Suez Canal or SUMED Pipeline,
diverting them around the southern tip of Africa]{.underline}, [adding
to transit time and]{.underline} cost. In addition, European and North
African southbound oil flows could no longer take the most direct route
to Asian markets via the Suez Canal and Bab el-Mandeb. **[Any hostile
air or sea presence in Yemen could threaten the entire traffic through
the Suez Canal]{.underline}**, **[as well as a daily flow of oil and
petroleum]{.underline}** products that the EIA estimates increased from
2.9 mmb/d in 2009 to 3.8 mmb/d in 2013. Such a threat also can be
largely covert or indirect. Libya demonstrated this under Qaddafi when
he had a cargo ship drop mines in the Red Sea.

"The Senate voted on Thursday to end American military assistance for
Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen," wrote the New York Times in a recent
article that never mentioned Iran, thereby missing the entire point. The
Senate's goal was to punish Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman, known as MbS, for the role he and his government reportedly
played in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Khashoggi's murder
brought attention to "the fact that we have been led into this civil war
in Yemen, half a world away, into a conflict in which few Americans that
I know can articulate what American national security interest is at
stake," said one senator. He should know better[. The mullahs of Iran
have declared war not only on the West and Israel, but also on Sunni
Islam.]{.underline} Saudi Arabia, home to Mecca and Medina near the Red
Sea, and Egypt, home of al-Azhar University, are prime targets. [Iran
has been harassing shipping in the Persian Gulf]{.underline} --- east of
Saudi Arabia --- for years[. Iranian fast attack craft have charged U.S.
Navy ships,]{.underline} their drones have buzzed American fighter jets,
and lasers were directed at U.S. helicopters operating at sea. These
efforts culminated in the capture of 10 American sailors in 2016. Such
harassment largely stopped in 2017, but Iran has been sailing warships
in the Red Sea to the west of Saudi Arabia. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps (IRGC) commander, Qassem Soleimani, declared, "The Red Sea,
which was secure, is no longer secure with the American presence." Our
senators might want to consult a map. [Iran has no border on the Red
Sea, but a base in the heel of the Saudi boot, i.e.,]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} [Yemen]{.underline}, [**would put it in a perfect
position to encircle Saudi Arabia by water, and to also undermine Egypt,
Jordan and Isra**el]{.underline}. [It would allow access to overland
routes through Somalia, Eritrea and Sudan --- and directly into Egypt
---]{.underline} [for the purpose of arming rebels along the coast and
the militias Egypt has been fighting in the Sinai desert]{.underline}.
[The Red Sea is the only Israeli outlet to the Gulf of Aden and then the
Arabian Sea, the route of Israel's burgeoning trade with India and
China. It is Jordan's only sea outlet, and the Eilat-Aqaba Free Trade
Zone is a major source of trade revenue for America's ally, King
Abdullah II. For Egypt, it is the route to and from the Suez
Canal]{.underline}. [**Therefore, Iran has been stoking the Houthi
insurrection** in Yemen, providing, among other things, long-range
missiles that have been fired into Riyadh]{.underline}. U.S. warships
have intercepted several Iranian weapons shipments intended for Houthi
militias. Other shipments have been intercepted coming overland from
Oman. All such shipments to the Houthis are in violation of U.N.
resolutions. If security and freedom of navigation for these allies are
not sufficient reasons for the United States to be concerned with Iran
at the chokepoint of the Bab el Mandeb Strait, consider this: Camp
Lemonnier, the U.S. naval expeditionary base, sits directly opposite
Yemen off Djibouti. Camp Lemonnier is home to the Combined Joint Task
Force --- Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) and the U.S. Africa Command
(USAFRICOM) and is the only permanent U.S. military base in Africa. What
does the base do there? The countries north of the Mediterranean Sea are
European, all of which except Bosnia are NATO members. Facing them,
along the North African coast, are Sunni Muslim countries, all of which
except Libya are partners in NATO's Mediterranean Dialogue. The
arrangement helps keep the Mediterranean stable and free for shipping.
[One way to make North Africa less stable is to make the row of
countries underneath it less stable. Chad, Mali, Somalia, Eritrea, Sudan
and Niger all are targets of instability seekers, including
Iran]{.underline}. The [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [helps
those governments more effectively control their own territory and
borders, reducing the likelihood of transnational jiha]{.underline}d.
They are, to be sure, as much targets of Sunni jihad as they are of
Iran, but [Iran's massive infusion of funds supports Sunni Hamas, al
Qaeda, ISIS, Boko Haram, al Shabab and others]{.underline}.
[Instability, chaos, anti-Americanism, anti-Israelism, anti-Westernism
and anti-Christianity are what Iran seeks]{.underline} --- and they are
what Sunni jihadists seek. In Iraq and Syria, ISIS did the destabilizing
and Iran reaped the benefit. How the United States should position
itself, vis-a-vis MbS or the Yemen war, is a matter for debate. But
**[members of the U.S. Senate should be able to articulate American
national security interests in the Middle East and Africa --- and to
recognize Iran as the threat to those interests.]{.underline}**

[Reports of Islamic State's demise are premature]{.underline}. [While
its core territory]{.underline} in Syria and Iraq [is nearly
gone]{.underline}, it maintains at least eight branches operating from
Nigeria to Pakistan. Of these, **[the group's presence in Egypt's
strategic Sinai Peninsula is arguably most worrisome]{.underline}**,
**[as sustained operations from there could undermine Egypt's internal
security, threaten regional allies such as Israel and Jordan, and
disrupt shipping through the Suez Canal]{.underline}**. Last week the
United States restored the \$195 million in military aid that it had
withheld from Egypt because of the country's human rights record and its
ties to North Korea. This was the right move. Egypt has long been one of
the world's largest recipients of U.S. aid, accepting \$71.6 billion in
bilateral military and economic aid between 1948 and 2011 -- the largest
amount of any country in that time period, other than Israel. The United
States has given Egypt about \$1.3 billion per year in military aid
since 1987. Last August, the United States decided to deny Egypt \$95.7
million in aid and to delay an additional \$195 million because of
concerns about human rights under Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Sisi was elected
president after he led the army in ousting Mohammad Mursi. His
government then enacted a law restricting the activities of
nongovernmental organizations -- part of a wider crackdown on dissent.
Under Sisi scores of websites have been taken down and journalists and
opponents have been arrested. In a 2017 State Department memo to
Congress, U.S. officials wrote that the "overall human rights climate in
Egypt continues to deteriorate, with the government enacting legislation
that conflicts with its human rights obligations, including the right of
peaceful assembly, freedom of association, freedom of expression, and
due process guarantees." In March voters elected Sisi to a second term,
in an election that saw all major opposition candidates cut short their
campaigns, citing intimidation. Yet despite Sisi's record on human
rights, it is still in the United States' interests to support Egypt.
Doing so will help hold the line against IS and prevent Egypt from
turning to a country like Russia for security and economic cooperation.
Washington should adopt a two-track approach with Egypt, as it has
historically done with Turkey, advancing security issues at the same
time it pushes for improvements in human rights and democracy. [Egypt
has long been a critical U.S. security partner because of its control of
the Suez Canal and its border with Israel. **When U.S. forces are
engaged in the region**]{.underline}, **[Egypt provides expedited access
for U.S. naval vessels transiting the Suez Canal and overflight rights
for U.S. military aircraft, both of which are crucial for the United
States' ability to project power across the Middle East]{.underline}**.
**[Its role as a linchpin of regional stability has grown with multiple
forces roiling the Middle East in recent years]{.underline}**. [Amid
Iranian and Russian entrenchment]{.underline} [in the Levant, and the
recent rise in IS and Hamas operations]{.underline}, [Egypt has remained
squarely in the camp of secular and reformist Middle Eastern countries
trying to stop the spread of Islamist extremism]{.underline}. [Cairo is
working with Israel to contain IS in the Sinai and Hamas in Gaza, and
the countries' navies coordinate regularly on Mediterranean security
issues]{.underline}. I met with Sisi in May, when I visited Egypt as
part of a delegation sponsored by the Jewish Institute for National
Security of America, and he was keen to emphasize the common security
interests Cairo shares with Washington and Jerusalem, and his desire to
advance both partnerships. [Egypt's internal security is threatened by a
relentless IS-affiliated insurgency in Sinai]{.underline}. In November
the group attacked a Sinai mosque, killing more than 300 people. Egypt
also faces the ever-present challenge of preventing the conflict in
Libya from spilling over its western border. (While Cairo and Washington
both want a stable Libya, the Sisi government is backing Gen. Khalifa
Haftar, a military strongman who was once a CIA asset; the United States
is supporting his rival and UN-backed Libyan government.) **[Further
instability in Egypt would be disastrous for its nearly 100 million
citizens, the region and the United States.]{.underline}** Regardless of
which might come first **[-- the collapse of Egypt's economy or the
spread of Islamist insurgency --]{.underline}** the other **[would
surely follow]{.underline}**. **[The result would be new extremist safe
havens, millions of desperate Egyptians seeking to flee to Europe, an
existential threat to Israel, the disruption of the Suez Canal upon
which global economic stability depends and the potential for the United
States to get involved in yet another Middle East
quagmire]{.underline}**. Recent American support for Egypt's
counterterrorism efforts in Sinai and the resumption of Bright Star
joint military exercises are both steps in the right direction. So is
the United States' recent decision to provide Egypt with its
fully-authorized \$1.3 billion in foreign military financing. Egypt
needs this assistance to replenish military capabilities expended
combatting IS in Sinai, and to respond effectively to any IS resurgence.
It will also help improve bilateral military interoperability and
promote Egypt's continued phaseout of Soviet-era weaponry. U.S.
assistance should also include greater technical support for U.S.
equipment that Egypt uses in the Sinai and more bilateral military
exchanges, including sharing U.S. lessons-learned from counterterrorism
operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. These policy changes can
bolster Washington's influence in Cairo, helping to disrupt Russia's
shaping of a Middle East security environment reminiscent of the Cold
War. They can also capitalize on a fleeting opportunity to defeat the
scourge of IS by advancing an important relationship and promoting
economic development and democracy in a vital Middle East partner.

The U.S. Senate is poised to debate a resolution that would force the
end to United States support for the Yemen war, and numerous senators
have asserted that such a measure could help bring an end to the
conflict. With the White House strongly opposed to this effort, it is
far from clear that Congress will end up enacting any Yemen-related
legislation. However, no matter what transpires in the final legislative
end game, it is worth examining both the premise of congressional
actions and the likely strategic consequences. Unfortunately, calls to
"stop the Yemen war," though morally satisfying, are fundamentally
misguided. They ignore what is at stake in the Yemen conflict and the
true identity of the warring parties. A precipitous disengagement by the
Saudi-led coalition from militarily backing the UN-backed government of
Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi in the Yemeni civil war would have calamitous
consequences for Yemen, the Middle East and the world at large. The
urgency to end the war reduces that conflict, and its drivers, to a
morality play, with the coalition of Arab states cast as the
bloodthirsty villain killing and starving Yemeni civilians. [The
assumption seems to be that if the coalition's military operations are
brought to a halt, all will be well in Yemen]{.underline}. Everybody
seems to have forgotten that the conflict was triggered in late 2014
when the Houthis, backed by Iran, toppled the Yemeni government and took
over large areas of the country, including strategic positions on the
Red Sea. In seizing power, the Houthis inflicted massive civilian
casualties and crippling damage to Yemen's rudimentary infrastructure.
Presented with a strategic threat at its doorstep, posed by an Iranian
proxy and a humanitarian crisis, Saudi Arabia, responding to a request
by Yemen's legitimate government and backed by U.N. Resolution 2216,
militarily intervened in the Yemen conflict seeking to restore Yemen's
legitimate government. As has been the case with the Afghan and Iraq
wars, prosecuted by U.S.-led coalitions, the counterinsurgency campaign
in Yemen has been a difficult enterprise. Because the Houthis have been
fighting in a way that deliberately places civilians at risk, Yemen has
experienced dire security and humanitarian circumstances. To curtail the
influx of Iranian arms, the Saudi-led coalition periodically has
restricted access to the port of Hodeidah, one of six main ports in
Yemen, and a vital transit area for both humanitarian supplies and
Iranian weapons transfers. The Houthis have exploited both of these for
their war efforts and to consolidate their tactical gains on the ground,
and so, abandoning the coalition efforts would leave Yemen in the
rebels' hands. We have seen this in Syria. [Over the past several years,
U.S. policymakers have called for "de-escalating" the Syrian war. On
paper, the policy sounded prudent and moral.]{.underline} [In practice,
however, as the United States froze its assistance to the Syrian
opposition, Russia, Iran and the regime of Bashar al-Assad took
advantage of the de-escalation process. Towns and villages were besieged
and forced to surrender to Assad]{.underline}. In many of those towns,
[the government exacted revenge by arresting or killing
people]{.underline}. It also forcibly conscripted civilians into the
army or loyalist militias. Even as the U.S. administration lauded
"de-escalation" in its rhetoric, Syria and its Russian and Iranian
patrons simply consolidated their position and continued their military
campaign. [A similar scenario will unfold in Yemen if the Saudi-led
coalition were to cease operations**. Iran's long arm, the Houthis,
would march on coalition-liberated areas and exact a bloody toll on the
populations of cities**]{.underline} **[such as Aden and Marib with the
same ruthlessness to which they subjected Sanaa and Taiz during the past
three years]{.underline}**. **[The rebels have ruled Sanaa, kidnapping,
executing, disappearing, systematically torturing, and assassinating
detractors]{.underline}**. [In Taiz, they fire mortars indiscriminately
at the civilian population and snipers shoot at children to force
residents into submission]{.underline}.

incompetent war, but [too many critics are blinded by their hate of

cannot lose sight of the [key strategic objective in Yemen]{.underline}:
[to prevent the creation of a southern Hezbollah, which would enhance

The military branch of the Houthi movement could easily take advantage
of its powerful wartime role to crush its rivals in the political arm.
Doing so, however, would hinder the possibility of reconciliation with
other Yemeni groups postwar and would complicate the possibility of
peace[. If the war were to end tomorrow, though, the tensions within the
Houthi bloc would be left unresolved and would likely weaken the
movement from within.]{.underline} [As long as the divisions persist,
they will present opportunities for outside groups---including current
enemies.]{.underline} The Houthis' military wing is eager for Saudi
support, and it might be a shrewd move for the Saudis to deliver and
draw some of the Houthis to their side while weakening the movement as a
whole. Iran's Role in the Conflict Yemen's war is a gift to Iran; Iran's
quiet manipulation of the war has reinforced its opponents' fears that
it is a menacing power in the Arabian Peninsula. Due to the
mismanagement of the conflict, what was initially an inflated threat is
now becoming a reality. Iran has received this reputational boost at low
cost. In contrast to the Arab coalition, which spends \$5-6 billion each
month on the Yemen war, Iran is estimated to spend dramatically less on
the conflict---perhaps only several million dollars each year in Yemen.
This support has bolstered the Houthis and lengthened the conflict. Over
the past five years, Iran and its Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah, have
increased their military and technical support to the Houthis and helped
them survive the Arab coalition's onslaught. When the Arab Spring swept
Yemen, Iran's outreach to the Houthis was not exclusive. Iran was
interested in forming relationships with any group open to accepting its
patronage. Nor was Iran alone. Yemeni political blocs, and even civil
society groups, received new interest from Gulf countries, Turkey and
other foreign entities. Like other regional powers, Iran offered
workshops and training for independent female activists and grassroots
nongovernmental organizations. At one time, Iran also supported a branch
of Yemen's Southern Separatist Movement, which is now allied with Saudi
Arabia and the UAE. Iran has lost its influence over other Yemeni groups
since the outbreak of the conflict, but it remains the Houthis' most
significant foreign supporter. While the idea that Iran is the
mastermind behind the Houthi movement is widespread, the evolution of
the Houthi organization suggests that they sought out Iran, not the
other way around. Yemeni scholars on the Houthi movement have argued
that the Houthis were impressed by the organization and discipline of
Iran's Revolutionary Guard and Lebanon's Hezbollah and solicited their
advice. These experts have also suggested that cooperation is based on
political ambition rather than shared religious beliefs. Iran's
ideological influence on the Houthis may have begun when Hussein Badr
al-din al-Houthi visited the Iranian city of Qom in the early 1990s, but
Iran's direct tactical guidance was not evident until the sixth Sa'dah
War, when Saudi Arabia increased its involvement in the Saleh
government's wars against the Houthis. In October 2009 and January 2013,
two large shipments of weapons from Iran were intercepted by the Yemeni
government and the USS Farragut, respectively. These intercepted
shipments indicated how important access to the Midi and Salif ports in
Hodeidah province are to the Houthis' war effort. Iran also allegedly
transported supplies to the Houthis by air, delivering daily flights to
Sana'a airport for three weeks until access was blocked by the Saudi air
campaign. A U.N. Security Council report published in January 2019
revealed that Iran is also providing the Houthis with an estimated \$30
million worth of fuel each month. This support is not the same thing as
control. In fact, at times the Houthis appear to have acted against the
advice provided by their Iranian backers. It was even reported that Iran
advised the Houthis against the capture of the city of Sana'a and
counseled them to withdraw their forces from specific parts of
Yemen---presumably to protect the negotiation and implementation of the
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The Houthis' rejection of
Iran's direction revealed that the relationship between Iran and the
Houthis, though it had its roots in the 2009 Sa'dah war, was still
nascent in 2015. The successful capture of Sana'a was a surprise to
everyone who doubted the Houthis' capabilities, including Iran. It also
suggests that Iran was not prioritizing its influence in Yemen at the
time. It was the Houthis, not their foreign patrons, who asserted their
own will to power and proceeded with their agenda. However, their poor
planning and limited political experience prevented them from
anticipating the Arab coalition's coordinated retaliation and since then
they have come to rely more on Iranian support. The Trump administration
has sought to amplify the perception of Iranian influence in Yemen,
especially since its withdrawal from the JCPOA in May 2018. In December
2017, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley delivered a
speech in which she presented evidence that the Houthis had used Iranian
weapons against Saudi Arabia and called for international condemnation.
As the Trump administration works to increase Iran's diplomatic and
economic isolation, Iran is likely to increase its presence and
involvement in Yemen to cement the increased influence it has developed
there in recent years. An increased Iranian role would prove even more
devastating to the Yemeni people and would exacerbate the humanitarian
crisis. The Houthis' and Yemen's Future Since the early 2000s, and
especially in the past four years of conflict, the Houthis have
transformed from a small-scale rebel group warring in Yemen's extreme
north to central participants in perhaps the most significant regional
conflict in the history of the modern Arabian Peninsula and the world's
deadliest war today. Since 2011, they have risen from controlling
Sa'dah, a single marginalized governorate, to the majority of Yemen's
north, including the country's capital and its (failing) institutions.
Today, the Houthis are taking on the Arab coalition, which is flush with
Western weapons and oil money. **[It will be challenging to convince the
Houthis to view a state of peace as preferable to a state of
war]{.underline}**. [The Houthis]{.underline}, like many other parties
to the conflict in Yemen, [understand that peace represents the
diminution and transformation of their influence in]{.underline}

[The Stockholm
Treaty](https://osesgy.unmissions.org/full-text-stockholm-agreement)
signed in December 2018 remains in force but has faltered in its
implementation and needs reinforcement. Though it was criticized as
vague and insubstantial, the treaty was nevertheless welcomed as a
first, albeit tentative, step toward peace. The peace process initiated
in Stockholm has faced hurdles in the months since; [the head of the
U.N. peace monitoring
forces](https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/un-to-replace-head-of-yemen-monitoring-mission-with-danish-military-official-1.819394)
has already been replaced amid continuing conflict between the Houthis
and their opponents. Monitoring the technical details of the treaty
matters, but more [important now is finding the political will for
peace]{.underline}. **[Convincing the Houthis to accept peace will
require pressure coupled with political incentives]{.underline}** **[to
curb their further expansion in Yemen]{.underline}** and to ameliorate
[the world's worst human-made humanitarian
crisis](https://www.rescue.org/article/why-yemen-worlds-worst-humanitarian-crisis).
As an incentive for peace, disarmament needs to include all nonstate
actors at war in Yemen, including the elite forces that support the
government. The Arab coalition will need to engage Houthi
representatives and form a functional relationship with them as a show
of good faith---as the Arab coalition already has with other Yemeni
parties. The United States will also need to reopen its channels of
communication with Yemen's warring parties and former political figures
to end their heavy reliance on their Arab coalition partners and finally
play a significant role as mediator. The U.S. relationship with Iran
will determine the extent and direction of Iranian involvement and
influence on the Houthis in Yemen. Finally, focusing on the needs of the
Houthis in isolation from the needs of rebuilding Yemen as a whole will
only lead to failed peace attempts and could empower the Houthis
further. [If Yemen is to remain a unitary state, the grievances of all
Yemenis will need to be addressed]{.underline}. To ensure this happens,
international organizations such as the United Nations and the European
Union, and countries with regional credibility and legitimacy such as
Oman, should step up to act as primary partners for peace with the
support of the United States, Britain and other powerful countries. If
the Houthis fail to uphold their end of the peace bargain, the United
Nations and other peace brokers should pressure the Houthis with
exclusion in postconflict arrangements or the peace-building
process---especially if the other political and military factions in
Yemen can agree. But this should be a last resort. **[The Houthis are a
powerful faction, and even if they have struggled to govern the country,
they have demonstrated the capacity to stoke conflict and spoil
political cooperation. This will remain true whenever the war
ends.]{.underline}**

But [abandoning America's Gulf partners in Yemen would be even more
disastrous both for American interests and for the humanitarian and
international legal concerns driving most of those who advocate this
course.]{.underline} Our partners are unlikely to find a way out of the
war and will continue fighting without US support. Unlike many of our
other partners, Saudi Arabia and the UAE do not depend on the US for
financial support and can readily purchase weapons and expertise from
other states that do not remotely share our values or concerns. Driving
them into the arms of those states, which would be damaging to American
interests writ large, would also remove any restraint on their military
actions. The desire to dissociate from the bad actions of America's
partners is therefore understandable, but misplaced. Although limited,
American influence has shaped both Saudi and Emirati actions for the
better. The US could do even more to shape their behavior if it engaged
more seriously in the effort. Instead of retreating in disgust, the US
must work to extricate its partners from Yemen by actively pursuing a
long-term political resolution and using its considerable leverage with
them to rein in the worst aspects of their own practices and
inclinations. US policy must also recognize that the current efforts to
deliver a political resolution to the conflict are flawed. The UN-led
**[effort to negotiate a political resolution]{.underline}** to the
current war **[is unlikely to succeed]{.underline}** **[and will not
address the conditions that drove Yemenis to war in the first
place.]{.underline}** These [conditions]{.underline}, which [include the
grievances that united Yemenis against Ali Abdullah Saleh's government
in 2011]{.underline}, **[create opportunities for Salafi-jihadi groups
such as al Qaeda and for Iran to increase their influence in
Yemen]{.underline}**. **[The humanitarian conditions, poor before the
war and worsening still, will not stabilize without a
settlement]{.underline}** better than the one the UN is currently
championing. That effort is to establish a ceasefire or some sort of
interim agreement in order to return Yemen to the political transition
process launched in 2011. [Yet the current conflict results from the
inherent problems in that political transition process, which failed to
address the grievances of major opposition groups, including the al
Houthis and the southerners]{.underline}. **[These groups are unlikely
to accept the outcomes of a process today that led them to go to war in
2014]{.underline}**. The UN-led peace process also exaggerates the
importance of the internationally recognized Yemeni government over the
actual factions on the ground. These [factions]{.underline} have
supported the Yemeni government against the al Houthis as a shared
near-term interest, but [diverge with the government over the future
shape of Yemen]{.underline}. UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths has
recognized the need to discuss what postwar Yemen will be through Track
II discussions, but ultimately remains focused on brokering an initial
settlement between the al Houthis and the Yemeni government. [War in
Yemen has acquired a momentum of its own, moreover, that will not be
easily stopped. The manner in which the war and political economy in
Yemen has developed incentivizes spoilers]{.underline}. **[The
fracturing of the country has led to the growth of regional powerbrokers
who benefit from continued chaos and conflict]{.underline}**.3 [The
governor of Ma'rib, west of Yemen's capital region, has a mini-fiefdom
that has grown rich during the war]{.underline}. **[The military units
in his governorate would probably support him rather than any new
central government]{.underline}** [emerging from the current peace
process]{.underline}. [The UAE supported the establishment of the
Southern Transitional Council]{.underline} (STC), [which unifies some
powerful southern figures]{.underline}, including secessionists and
members of the Yemeni government, [into a body seeking to secure
southern rights]{.underline}. **[UAE-backed Yemeni security forces would
almost certainly support the STC against the Yemeni
government.]{.underline}** Yemen's frontlines are also soft: Goods and
people equally traverse them, and adversaries on the battlefield all
benefit from sales in the same black-market arms networks.4 Elite
negotiations will not resolve these problems; the US must recognize the
importance and interests of these substate actors and engage them
directly and through our partners to shape conditions for an enduring
peace. The international community has turned from efforts to negotiate
a full peace to attempts to ameliorate the humanitarian disaster
resulting from the current conflict. These attempts will fail to do
either. UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths negotiated a groundbreaking
agreement between the al Houthis and the internationally recognized
government in Stockholm, Sweden, in December 2018.5 Unfounded optimism
continues to surround the agreement as it opens up the possibility of
broader negotiations for a national ceasefire. Implementation of the
agreement remains problematic. Sustained international pressure, rapidly
deteriorating humanitarian conditions, and the inevitable al Houthi loss
of al Hudaydah port to coalition-backed forces helped facilitate this
agreement. [But the al Houthis do not perceive overall military defeat
as inevitable and have been recalcitrant in the face of international
pressure and local humanitarian conditions.]{.underline} The al Houthis
have knowingly diverted much-needed food assistance from starving
populations for profit to support their war effort.6 [There is no likely
road from the current agreement to any larger elite agreement, and even
elite settlement would not resolve the substate-actor
proble]{.underline}m that will continue to drive conflict in ways that
open the door to continued al Qaeda and Iranian penetration. Even a
return to a focus on the elite settlement via the UN-led peace process
in Yemen is unlikely to deliver a long-term political solution for Yemen
acceptable to the United States and partners such as Saudi Arabia,
however. Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States have conceded publicly that
the al Houthis will be part of a political solution, and the al Houthis
have announced they are open to political negotiations, but these
[statements conceal a possibly insurmountable gap between the
expectations of influence in a future Yemeni]{.underline}
[state]{.underline}. The al Houthis' continued relationship with Iran
and possession of certain weapons systems will likely drive Saudi Arabia
off. [The al Houthis are unlikely to give up their military capabilities
in advance of any solution. They also have little incentive to agree to
any solution that reduces the extent of their influence over northern
Yemen and the central Yemeni government institutions]{.underline}
without a coalition military victory, which would come at significant
expense and cost of life, if at all. It is almost certainly necessary to
persuade the al Houthis that they will ultimately lose before an
enduring settlement can be reached---an undertaking that requires a more
skillful and nuanced strategy than the coalition has been pursuing along
with more serious and energetic diplomatic engagement by the US and its
extra-regional partners.

Yemen"
<https://www.wsj.com/articles/congress-emboldens-iran-in-the-name-of-peace-in-yemen-11561503382>)

With tensions escalating in the Middle East, [Congress is emboldening
Iran by sending the wrong message about Yemen.]{.underline} Last week
the Senate voted to halt military sales to Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates. Earlier this year, President Trump was forced to veto a
congressional resolution aimed at ending U.S. assistance to the
Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. Congress evidently can\'t separate its
response to the killing of Jamal Khashoggi from the threats posed by the
Houthis, Iranians and terrorists in Yemen. This is no time to be sending
mixed messages to Tehran. I know Yemen. I worked there as an undercover
Central Intelligence Agency officer in the aftermath of the deadly 2000
bombing by al Qaeda of the USS Cole in the port of Aden. Since 2014,
when the Iranian-backed Houthi government attacked Yemen\'s
internationally recognized government and seized the capital, Sana\'a,
the country has descended into a humanitarian crisis that is among the
world\'s worst. According to the United Nations, some 24 million people
need humanitarian assistance and protection, mostly in Houthi-held
territory. An estimated 7.4 million need treatment for malnutrition,
including two million children under 5. The Houthis\' extensive use of
land mines has killed and maimed civilians and left vulnerable
communities cut off from their crops, clean water and humanitarian aid.
[Iran has capitalized on the suffering. Tehran is turning Yemen into a
proxy state and haven for terrorist groups.]{.underline} Th[is is what
the Saudi-led coalition is fighting to prevent]{.underline}.
Congressional efforts to end intelligence and logistics support for the
Saudis and Emiratis in Yemen are the wrong way to punish Riyadh for the
murder of Khashoggi. I joined many of my colleagues in condemning this
murder and have called for a change of course in Riyadh. Concerns about
civilian casualties and other actions by the coalition are valid and
deserve attention. A more effective response from the U.S. would be to
retain leverage over the coalition by continuing our support without
engaging in active hostilities. The alternative is the radicalization of
an entire generation of Yemenis. The Houthi movement\'s slogan is \"God
is Great, death to America, death to Israel, curse upon the Jews,
victory to Islam.\" This ideology has shaped the education of children
in areas of Yemen they control. Houthi schools force children to embrace
this hateful slogan, which was inspired by Iran\'s 1979 revolution. The
radicalization of Yemen\'s youth represents a long-term threat to the
region and U.S. interests that can\'t be ignored. [Iran\'s recent
attempts to provoke a military conflict with the U.S. make it even more
important for Congress to send a clear message regarding
Yemen]{.underline}. As a first step, lawmakers should pass a resolution
condemning the Houthis for human-rights violations and demanding they
uphold their end of the U.N.-brokered cease-fire. [This would show the
world that the U.S. won\'t accept Iranian efforts to sow chaos in the
region. No one should treat the malign regime in Iran as a victim. It is
the world\'s foremost state sponsor of terrorism.]{.underline} The
terrorist groups and violent militias it supports have launched
thousands of rockets at Israeli civilians and killed more than 600
American troops in Iraq. The focus on Iran\'s nuclear program has often
distracted from the Iranian conventional-missile program and support for
terrorism that threatens our allies and destabilizes the Middle East.
**[If the Houthis win the civil war and consolidate control over all or
part of Yemen, Iran would gain a foothold on the Arabian
Peninsula]{.underline}**. From **[Saudi Arabia\'s doorstep Iranian
proxies would be able to threaten the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, a strategic
choke]{.underline}** **[point]{.underline}** connecting the Indian Ocean
to the Red Sea**[. With control of the strait, Iran could block shipping
access to the Suez Canal and hold global commerce hostage. This must
never be allowed to happen.]{.underline}**

Finally[, Washington's bid to wind down the war in Yemen comes in the
context of escalating tensions with Iran in the wake of the
administration's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement, and the
reimposition of economic sanctions including on Iran's oil
exports.]{.underline} **[As a result of the heightened geopolitical
competition, Iran will be reluctant to acquiesce to a negotiating
process to end the Yemen civil war without achieving significant
gains]{.underline}**. With the military balance tilting decisively in
favor of the Assad regime in Syria, the stalemate in the formation of a
government in Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia's inability to achieve military
victory in Yemen, [it is noticeable that Iran has been reluctant to give
the green light to its proxies to negotiate in any of the key regional
conflict arenas]{.underline}. **[While the extent of Iran's influence
over the Houthis is difficult to discern, it is hard to imagine that the
Houthi leadership would engage in diplomatic negotiations over Tehran's
opposition]{.underline}**. [Achieving a settlement to the Yemen civil
war is therefore inextricably linked with the broader regional security

perhaps the greatest challenge to reaching viable settlements of

It is a mistake to bucket the al Houthis in the same category as the
Assad regime, Lebanese Hezbollah, or Iranian-controlled Shi\'a militias
in Iraq. The al Houthi movement existed before Tehran was much
interested in it, and Iranian support remains too limited to give the
Iranians control over al Houthi policies. The IRGC certainly would love
to have such control and, no doubt, to provide more support, but the
difficulties of getting Iranian agents and material into al Houthi areas
are simply too great. [Iran has transferred to the al Houthis the means
of producing lethal weapons as a mitigation]{.underline}. [This
indigenous capacity reduces Iranian leverage over the al Houthis, but
also increases the risk that the al Houthis could proliferate these
capabilities further, potentially giving Iran additional cover in its
efforts to create and support other regional proxies with less direct
involvement]{.underline}. But they retain their independence---the al
Houthis are not so much under Iranian influence that Tehran could cause
them either to make or to reject a peace deal. Yemen is thus a defensive
front for the US in the struggle against Iranian regional malign
behavior**[. It is important to deprive Iran of the ability to strike
Riyadh and Abu Dhabi by proxy or to disrupt traffic through the Bab el
Mandab Strait.]{.underline}** Countersmuggling efforts to block the
transfer of ballistic missile and drone components and computer systems
will limit the al Houthis' ability to carry out such attacks. But
pressure on the al Houthis does not harm Iran enough to affect Iranian
policy throughout the region.

not succeed "despite its many efforts" in taking the port of Al-Hudayda
away from the Houthis in Yemen and the forces of Ansar Allah, the Houthi

Allah has proven "a good ability to infiltrate into Saudi Arabia," and
even, "in recent days, drones have been sent into the skies over Riyadh,
which hit a refinery belonging to the Saudi Aramco company." According
to Sheik-al-Salam, the Saudis admitted that a fire broke out in the
refinery, but they gave no reason for it. The parliamentary aide
continued to say that Ansar Allah's new drone, the Samad, is a new
weapon that can have a serious effect throughout the region because its

to fulfill the threat that Hassan Rouhani spoke about."4

<https://securitystudies.org/yemen-once-more-with-feeling/>)mba-alb

The House of Representatives' vote yesterday to end American support for
the war in Yemen is based on an ignorance of the strategic stakes there.
The debate in Congress has not demonstrated that any member seems to
understand just what is going on there. This ignorance is in some sense
understandable. Yemen is a small, distant country that few Americans
know much about. For those who do come to know more about it, it doesn't
seem more impressive. It relies heavily on international aid even when
it is not engaged in civil war. Its chief agricultural product is a
mildly euphoric drug, qat, that few outside the region even want. It is
badly governed where it has been governed at all. It surely must seem as
if nothing of consequence could possibly be gained or lost there. So,
from the perspective of the Congress, it must seem an opportunity to
vote to signal their virtue with nothing really being at stake. Except
this: [That choke point in the red circle at the bottom of the map is
the Bab-el-Mandeb strait. It is one of two choke points that controls
most of the flow of oil to America's allies in Asia]{.underline}.
America's enemies in Yemen, the Houthis, are backed by Iran. They have
already used shore-launched anti-ship missiles to close this strait to
oil tankers heading to American allies in Asia. These missiles are
provided to them by Iran, as are unconventional warfare trainers who
teach them how to fire the missiles. The other choke point, the Strait
of Hormuz, borders Iran. Iran's missile forces can be used against
traffic there too. The effect of closing both straits to oil traffic
would be to strangle America's Asian allies: Japan gets two-thirds of
its oil from the UAE or Saudi Arabia, and that oil has to travel through
one of these two straits. [Why would Iran wish to close these straits to
America's Asian allies?]{.underline} **[In addition to being able to
muscle America by muscling our allies, Iran has a special relationship
with China]{.underline}**, **[which wishes to push America out of East
Asia and to dominate our allies.]{.underline}** [The ability to choke
oil supplies to Japan, or South Korea, or Thailand, or Taiwan, that
would be a powerful weapon in China's arsenal.]{.underline} **[The
future of Asia, and America's role there, may turn on this ugly little
war in Yemen]{.underline}**. [The war in Yemen is thus
crucial]{.underline}. Sometimes when a conflict is crucial, we have to
fight it even though it costs a lot of American lives and much American
treasure. Neither is true here. The war in Yemen is being fought by
others, especially the Saudis and their allies in the Gulf Cooperation
Council. America is merely providing supplies to our allies. The
Security Studies Group does not oppose Congress' use of its war powers
in principle. However, it is foolish in the extreme to elect to lose
this particular fight. It is very much in our interest, and in the
interests of important American allies. It costs no American lives, and
little American money compared to conflicts like those in Syria or
Afghanistan. Concern for the suffering people in Yemen is reasonable,
but there are ways to pursue that short of cutting off American support
to our allies. The Senate has an opportunity to reverse course now. Let
us hope that at least some Senators will show that they appreciate what
America's interests here are. By all means help the suffering, but not
by conceding such a crucial strategic choke point to Iran and, behind
them, China.

The U.S. Senate is poised to debate a resolution that would force the
end to United States support for the Yemen war, and numerous senators
have asserted that such a measure could help bring an end to the
conflict. With the White House strongly opposed to this effort, it is
far from clear that Congress will end up enacting any Yemen-related
legislation. However, no matter what transpires in the final legislative
end game, it is worth examining both the premise of congressional
actions and the likely strategic consequences. Unfortunately, calls to
"stop the Yemen war," though morally satisfying, are fundamentally
misguided. They ignore what is at stake in the Yemen conflict and the
true identity of the warring parties. A precipitous disengagement by the
Saudi-led coalition from militarily backing the UN-backed government of
Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi in the Yemeni civil war would have calamitous
consequences for Yemen, the Middle East and the world at large. The
urgency to end the war reduces that conflict, and its drivers, to a
morality play, with the coalition of Arab states cast as the
bloodthirsty villain killing and starving Yemeni civilians. The
assumption seems to be that if the coalition's military operations are
brought to a halt, all will be well in Yemen. Everybody seems to have
forgotten that the conflict was triggered in late 2014 when the Houthis,
backed by Iran, toppled the Yemeni government and took over large areas
of the country, including strategic positions on the Red Sea. In seizing
power, the Houthis inflicted massive civilian casualties and crippling
damage to Yemen's rudimentary infrastructure. Presented with a strategic
threat at its doorstep, posed by an Iranian proxy and a humanitarian
crisis, Saudi Arabia, responding to a request by Yemen's legitimate
government and backed by U.N. Resolution 2216, militarily intervened in
the Yemen conflict seeking to restore Yemen's legitimate government. As
has been the case with the Afghan and Iraq wars, prosecuted by U.S.-led
coalitions, the counterinsurgency campaign in Yemen has been a difficult
enterprise. Because the Houthis have been fighting in a way that
deliberately places civilians at risk, Yemen has experienced dire
security and humanitarian circumstances. To curtail the influx of
Iranian arms, the Saudi-led coalition periodically has restricted access
to the port of Hodeidah, one of six main ports in Yemen, and a vital
transit area for both humanitarian supplies and Iranian weapons
transfers. The Houthis have exploited both of these for their war
efforts and to consolidate their tactical gains on the ground, and so,
abandoning the coalition efforts would leave Yemen in the rebels' hands.
We have seen this in Syria. Over the past several years, U.S.
policymakers have called for "de-escalating" the Syrian war. On paper,
the policy sounded prudent and moral. In practice, however, as the
United States froze its assistance to the Syrian opposition, Russia,
Iran and the regime of Bashar al-Assad took advantage of the
de-escalation process. Towns and villages were besieged and forced to
surrender to Assad. In many of those towns, the government exacted
revenge by arresting or killing people. It also forcibly conscripted
civilians into the army or loyalist militias. Even as the U.S.
administration lauded "de-escalation" in its rhetoric, Syria and its
Russian and Iranian patrons simply consolidated their position and
continued their military campaign. A similar scenario will unfold in
Yemen if the Saudi-led coalition were to cease operations. Iran's long
arm, the Houthis, would march on coalition-liberated areas and exact a
bloody toll on the populations of cities such as Aden and Marib with the
same ruthlessness to which they subjected Sanaa and Taiz during the past
three years. The rebels have ruled Sanaa, kidnapping, executing,
disappearing, systematically torturing, and assassinating detractors. In
Taiz, they fire mortars indiscriminately at the civilian population and
snipers shoot at children to force residents into submission. Having an
Iranian satellite armed with Iranian ballistic missiles on the Saudi
doorstep would pose an intolerable threat to the kingdom, comparable to
having the Soviet Union seize control of Mexico during the Cold War. But
the stakes in Yemen involve more than just Saudi Arabia's national
security or the peace and prosperity of the Yemeni people. [**An abrupt
termination of the war would leave Iran in control of Yemen would deal a
serious blow to the global economy**. Iran would have the ability to
obstruct trade and oil flows from both the Strait of Hormuz and the
Bab-el-Mandeb strait]{.underline}, the latter of which has been
tormented by Somali piracy for the decades. [Iran would wield far
greater influence than Somali pirates if it were allowed to threaten
Bab-el-Mandeb]{.underline}. About 24 percent of the world's petroleum
and petroleum products supply passes through these two waterways, and
Iran already has the capability to disrupt oil flows from Hormuz and has
threatened to do so this year. **[Should Iran acquire that capability in
Bab-el-Mandeb, by establishing a foothold in the Gulf of Aden, even if
it chose not to utilize this capability, oil prices and insurance costs
would surge]{.underline}**. [Allowing the IRGC to control two of the
most strategic choke points for the global energy market is simply not
an option for the international community]{.underline}. **[There is
every reason to believe that Iran would launch attacks on maritime
traffic]{.underline}**. **[The Houthis have mounted multiple attacks on
commercial and military vessels over the past several years, and Iran
has supplied its Yemen proxy with drone boats, conventional aerial
drones and ballistic missiles]{.underline}**. [Iran's threats to disrupt
international waterways should not be taken lightly]{.underline}. The
Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corp ([IRGC) targeted Gulf oil tankers in
the mid-1980s, prompting the U.S. Navy to launch Operation Earnest Will
to protect the flow of oil]{.underline}. IRGC speedboats were deployed
from Iran's Farsi Island to launch rockets at oil tankers in the dead of
night. An underwater mine placed by the IRGC struck U.S.-flagged oil

effort in Yemen. The conflict has exacerbated a terrible humanitarian
crisis and claimed the lives of thousands of civilians. [But any
resolution to this war that leaves the Houthis with control over the
Yemeni people, or allows Iran to exert its influence over one of the
world's most strategic waterways, would be a humanitarian and security
disaster.]{.underline}

\"Bombs away\" should not be the first military response from the United
States, but respond we must. [Closing international waters
is]{.underline} a blockade -- essentially [an act of war against other
states]{.underline}. [Were we to stand idly by and let any nation shut
down a vital international passage, it would lend credence to the view
that the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is now too weakened
and timid to defend its sovereign rights]{.underline}. To ignore such
aggression would be like giving the Barbary Pirates a pass when they
ravaged U.S. shipping in the early 1800s. And, don\'t buy the line that
it\'s none of our business. Over a third of the world\'s oil transported
by sea goes through the strait. [If that flow stops, you can
bet]{.underline} the farm [it will cause huge problem here at
home]{.underline}. When the Heritage Foundation war-gamed this scenario
back in 2007, the impact was immediate: a near doubling in the cost of a
barrel of oil and a loss of 1 million domestic jobs. Though closing the
straits is an act of war, responses in war ought to be proportional.
Thus, the first U.S. military objective ought to be to reopen the
straits, and you don\'t have to attack Iran to do that. Consider 1987,
when Iran tried to interfere with the passage of oil through the strait.
President Ronald Reagan authorized Operation Ernest Will. The U.S. Navy
protected ships going through the straits and only conducted military
operations in defense of the tankers or U.S. forces. That should be the
going-in strategy today[. If Iranian attacks were to persist, then a
proportional and responsible act would be to take out the bases or
support infrastructure where the attacks originate]{.underline}. And [if
the Iranians still didn\'t get the message, the target set should then
be expanded to things that the regime values: targets like the Iranian
Revolutionary Guard Headquarters, government facilities, and other
military facilities -- including those contributing to Tehran\'s nuclear
weapon and ballistic missile program**. Going after these targets might
require taking out Iranian command and control and air defense
sites**]{.underline}. That would be justified. [At no point along the
way would the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [need to ask the
U]{.underline}nited [N]{.underline}ations or anyone else [for
permission]{.underline}. **[The United States would just be exercising
its inherent right as a nation to act in self-defense]{.underline}**. It
is worth noting that we wouldn\'t find ourselves seriously contemplating
such high-seas drama and tragedy today if the White House had spent the
last three years working to put an aggressive Iran back in its box.
Iranian hostility toward the United States was no secret when President
Obama took office. Tehran had been a declared state-sponsor of terrorism
since the 1980s. It\'s illegal nuclear weapons program had long been an
open secret. So, too, was the regime\'s institutional support in killing
U.S. soldiers in Iraq. Yet this administration wasted most its first
three years trying to \"engage\" this rogue regime. Little wonder Iran
treats the U.S. with contempt and threatens reprehensible acts against
international commerce even as it continues to prop another of the
world\'s worst dictators in Syria. Playing nice with Tehran, coupled
with the premature withdrawal of stabilizing U.S. troops from Iraq, have
brought us to where we are today. If the United States has to draw
swords to protect our interests in that part of the world, it will be
because this White House failed us. Odds are Tehran won\'t try to close
the strait. It knows the United States would have to reopen the passage.
But the mullahs also know that the last thing Obama wants is another war
before the election. So as long as they pull up short of actually
interfering with shipping, the Iranians feel they have a free pass to
bluster and taunt the U.S. with impunity.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - [Israel would deploy its military if Iran were to
try to block the Bab al-Mandeb strait that links the Red Sea to the Gulf
of Aden]{.underline}, Prime Minister Benjamin [Netanyahu
said]{.underline} on Wednesday. Last week, Saudi Arabia said it was
suspending oil shipments through the strait, on the main sea route from
the Middle East to Europe, after Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis attacked
two ships in the waterway. Saudi Arabia and Iran are in a three-year-old
proxy war in Yemen, which lies on the eastern side of Bab al-Mandeb.
[Yemen's Houthis, who have previously threatened to block the strait,
said last week they had the naval capability to hit Saudi ports and
other Red Sea targets]{.underline}. Iran has not threatened to block Bab
al-Mandeb but has said it would block the Strait of Hormuz, at the mouth
of the Gulf, if it were prevented from exporting its own oil. "**[If
Iran will try to block the straits of Bab al-Mandeb, I am certain that
it will find itself confronting]{.underline}** an international
**[coalition]{.underline}** that will be determined to prevent this, and
**[this coalition will also include all of Israel's military
branches]{.underline}**," Netanyahu said at a passing out parade for new
naval officers in Haifa. Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said in a
separate speech at the event that Israel had "recently heard of threats
to harm Israeli ships in the Red Sea." He gave no further details.
[Ships bound for Israel, mainly from Asia, pass through the waterway to
Eilat, or continue through the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean
Sea.]{.underline} [Ships bound for Jordan's Aqaba port and for some
Saudi destinations must also pass through the strait]{.underline}. Bab
al-Mandeb is 29 km (18 miles) wide, making hundreds of ships potentially
an easy target. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said an
estimated 4.8 million barrels per day of crude oil and products flowed
through it in 2016. Israel has attacked Iranian forces in Syria and has
insisted that they leave Syria completely. They have withdrawn to a
distance of 85 km (53 miles) from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights,
Russia's special envoy to Syria said on Wednesday.

Policy,

Saudi Arabia halted oil shipments through the narrow strait off the
coast of Yemen after an apparent attack on two oil tankers by
Iran-backed Houthi militants, underscoring the threat Tehran poses to
global energy choke points at a time of growing tension between Iran and
the United States. Saudi officials said Houthi militia targeted two
tankers west of the besieged port of Hodeida early Wednesday morning,
though it wasn't clear exactly how the ships were attacked. Sometime
later, Saudi Aramco said it would stop sending its oil tankers through
the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, the narrows at the southern end of the Red Sea
through which about 5 million barrels of oil pass every day. On
Thursday, Kuwait said it would consider halting oil shipments through
the strait as well, while the United Arab Emirates, which is allied with
Riyadh in the fight against Houthis in Yemen, condemned the attack. "We
are aware of the reported Houthi attack," said Capt. Bill Urban, a
spokesman for U.S. Central Command. "We remain vigilant and ready to
work with our partners to preserve the free flow of commerce throughout
the region." The incident, and the Saudi response, has more to do with
the regional struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran---as well as the
rising tensions between Tehran and Washington---than it does with
actually stopping shipments of oil. Crude prices barely rose after the
attack; Saudi Arabia can ship oil by pipeline to terminals higher up the
Red Sea to keep supplying Europe or route tankers around South Africa to
avoid Bab el-Mandeb. But Iran is desperate to find ways to fight back
against U.S. efforts to curtail its oil exports after the U.S.
withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal this spring---and choke points
such as Bab el-Mandeb and the much more important Strait of Hormuz offer
inviting targets. This month, Tehran renewed its perennial threat to
close Hormuz if its own oil exports are affected by U.S. sanctions.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani reiterated that threat over the
weekend, saying: "Do not play with the lion's tail. You will regret it
forever." Rouhani's bellicose rhetoric extended to other straits besides
Hormuz. While Iran does not border Bab al-Mandeb, its Houthi proxies do,
and their ability to interfere with oil shipments through the narrows
has been a concern since the war in Yemen started in 2015. "Hard-liners
are calling Rouhani the 'Lord of the Straits' these days, not just the
'Lord of Hormuz,'" said Matthew Reed, the vice president of the energy
consultancy Foreign Reports. Those threats have since been endorsed by
other elements of the Iranian leadership, including clerics and the
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which specifically threatened
the Red Sea on Thursday. "The Iranians are responding to \[U.S.
President Donald\] Trump's maximum pressure campaign with a maximum
threat campaign," Reed said. Iranian threats to close the Strait of
Hormuz are nothing new. In the 1980s, Iran and Iraq engaged in a "tanker
war" in the Persian Gulf that dragged in the U.S. Navy. More recently,
at times of tension with Washington, Tehran has periodically vowed to
block oil tankers from exiting the narrow strait, whether by mining the
channel or attacking tankers with speedboats or land-based missiles. But
actually [blocking Hormuz would require a huge effort from the Iranian
navy]{.underline} and the IRGC [and would invite a swift and
overwhelming response from U.S. naval forces. **Bab al-Mandeb offers a
lower-risk alternative** to push back against international
pressure---and]{.underline}, potentially, [**spike oil prices**. Iranian
leaders might be calculating that higher oil prices would increase
political pressure on Trump]{.underline} and reduce the country's pain
from lowering its volumes of oil exports. "[What makes this attack
special is the timing and rhetoric from Tehran," Reed said. "The Red
Sea, where they can pretend a proxy force is freelancing, is somewhere
the Iranians think they can maintain plausible deniability, unlike
Hormuz]{.underline}." Saudi Arabia, for reasons of its own, seems happy
to play along. The coalition says the attack was thwarted and only one
tanker suffered minor damage. Riyadh has also faced much graver threats
to oil shipments in the past. Yet this time, it halted exports through
the strait---essentially pulling a Neymar (to borrow a soccer analogy)
to call international attention to Iran's role in the Yemen war.
"There's no sign that the Houthis are trying to shut down all traffic in
the strait or that they even have the wherewithal," said Richard
Mallinson of Energy Aspects, a consultancy in London. "I think much more
the Saudis are trying to internationalize the threat. The more they can
portray the Houthis as Iranian puppets, that's a powerful narrative."
The attack hasn't yet spooked oil markets; crude prices rose a bit in
New York and London but could rise further if continued disruptions in
the strait lead to longer shipment times or higher insurance premiums,
Reed said. More importantly, the renewed tensions in critical choke
points such as Bab al-Mandeb and Hormuz are a timely reminder that the
oil market cannot ignore geopolitical problems forever. In recent years,
the oil market has shrugged off nasty events that would have sent crude
prices spiking in the past. Oil prices actually fell after the Islamic
State took over big chunks of Iraq, while the Syrian war spiraled out of
control, while Libya fell apart, while Venezuela imploded, and while the
Iranian-Saudi rivalry reached fever pitch. But these days, big oil
producers have little spare capacity to add to the market in case of a
big geopolitical shock. Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the United States are
pumping at near-record levels, and oil still hovers around \$70 a
barrel. Mallinson expects that those tight conditions in the oil market
will make it ripe for higher prices as soon as something goes wrong. The
last time the world had this little spare oil production capacity was a
decade ago, he notes, when crude hit all-time record highs of almost
\$150 a barrel. "This is not the highest that prices are going to go,
and that will be driven by geopolitical concerns. There won't be any
spare capacity to cushion your Venezuelas, your Libyas, and the like,"
he said.

[After]{.underline} Iran's [president]{.underline} Hassan Rouhani
obliquely [hinted at a threat to]{.underline} regional oil exports if
sanctions [block]{.underline}ed Iran's [oil sales]{.underline},
[attention turned to the wrong strait.]{.underline} While the [focus was
on]{.underline} the Arabian Gulf exit of [Hormuz]{.underline}, two Saudi
Aramco tankers were apparently attacked by Houthi forces in the Bab El
Mandeb at the southern end of the Red Sea, one suffering light damage.
In response, Saudi Aramco temporarily halted oil shipments through Bab
El Mandeb. It's not clear whether the attacks were directly encouraged
by Iran, done with its approval or against its wishes. But an incident
in the Red Sea can act as a warning shot without the direct attribution
that would attach to Hormuz. [Most concern on regional oil transit has
focused on the potential cut-off of oil shipments through the Strait of
Hormuz]{.underline}, some 18 million barrels per day of crude and almost
4 million bpd of refined products. But this is not the biggest danger.
Saudi Arabia's pipeline Petroline to Yanbu on the Red Sea can carry
about 5 million barrels per day and is being expanded to 7 million bpd
by the end of this year, although some is required to feed local
refineries. The associated 3.5 million bpd Muajjiz export terminal on
the Red Sea is being reopened. Abu Dhabi's pipeline from Habshan to
Fujairah on the Indian Ocean, outside the strait, has capacity of 1.5
million bpd, about half of the emirate's exports. [As prices would rise
sharply during a closure, Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi might even gain in
revenues despite shipping lower volumes]{.underline}. Oman, which
exports from Mina Al Fahal on the Gulf of Oman outside Hormuz, is
developing another terminal and an oil storage hub at Duqm in its south.
Duqm could eventually be connected to Oman's neighbours' pipelines to
provide a back-up for exports. [By contrast, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain
are entirely dependent on the strait.]{.underline} Apart from the
autonomous Kurdish region, [Iraq too requires Hormuz for all its current
exports]{.underline}, while the connection to the pipeline through
Turkey remains cut. Despite some discussions with Saudi Arabia, Iraq has
not regained access to the 1.65 million bpd IPSA pipeline to the Red Sea
which was seized after the First Gulf War, and its planned pipeline to
Aqaba in Jordan remains on paper. Members of the International Energy
Agency, most of the developed countries, are required to hold storage of
at least 90 days of net imports. The US' Strategic Petroleum Reserve has
more, though it is mostly light crude, which would not be a good
substitute for Gulf medium and heavy grades. China's own strategic
stocks, about 34 days of import cover, are planned to rise to 90 days by
2020, while India's are limited to about 10 days. [If a Hormuz blockade
reduced Gulf exports by about 13 million barrels per day, worldwide
strategic stocks ought to be enough for almost six months of
cover]{.underline}. For a while, logistical chaos would ensue, as
tankers, refineries and crude grades were shuffled around -- careful
contingency plans would be vital. Prices would rocket during the closure
but slump again as soon as it was over. [Military studies suggest that
an obstruction of Hormuz,]{.underline} by mines, small submarines,
"swarming" attacks by boats, and land-based missiles, [would be defeated
within a few weeks]{.underline} at most by US and allied naval forces.
[It would also be a casus belli for the US to make a much wider-ranging
strike against Iranian military and other targets. The]{.underline}
economies of China, Japan, South Korea and the EU would be directly
threatened. The US, now a major oil producer, is still a net importer
but would suffer less, while Russia would greatly benefit. [**Meanwhile,
Iran needs the strait for virtually all its oil exports**. Despite
long-running plans, it has still not developed a pipeline]{.underline}
to the port of Jask on the Gulf of Oman**[. So an attempted halt to oil
exports would be economic and diplomatic suicide]{.underline}**, only to
be attempted as a last resort. A stop to [Hormuz]{.underline} oil
shipments may be the most headline-grabbing worry for policymakers, and
the most striking threat Iran can make. But it [is the wrong place to
look for the most damaging impacts]{.underline}. **[With its back to the
wall, Iran might attack points of offshore oil and gas installations,
which are more vulnerable and would take much longer to
repair]{.underline}**. In 1986, a platform in Abu Dhabi's Abu Al
Bukhoosh field, possibly confused with Iran's nearby Salman field, was
damaged by Iraqi air attack. [A Hormuz blockade would create more
problems for]{.underline} liquefied natural gas ([LNG)
export]{.underline}s rather [than for oil.]{.underline} Qatar exports a
quarter of the world's LNG, all through Hormuz, and countries such as
South Korea, Japan and Taiwan are entirely dependent on LNG imports for
gas. Russia would take the chance to step up supplies to Europe,
bolstering its geopolitical influence. Gas is stored in much smaller
volumes than oil, especially if -- with US sanctions due in force in
November - a closure struck during the high-demand northern hemisphere
winter. And imports into the Gulf are crucial. Apart from Saudi Arabia,
the UAE's east coast and Oman, the Gulf countries bring in all their
seaborne supplies via Hormuz. Essential goods could come overland from
the Saudi Red Sea coast or Jordan, or by air, but this would be
logistically challenging and even a short interruption would be
damaging. Several countries have invested in emergency food stocks for
this reason. International businesses and expatriates operating in the
region would lose confidence and might not quickly return. A long-term
closure of Hormuz is, as long as the US opposes it, an idle threat. The
threat to oil is also overstated. A single-minded focus on one
much-wargamed scenario should not obscure more dangerous and innovative
threats.

Iran fuelling the conflict [Four years later, there is no end in sight
for the conflict mainly due to the world's failure to put enough
pressure on Iran]{.underline} to stop its support for Yemeni Al Houthi
extremists, analysts have said. "**[The Iranian regime continues to
provide]{.underline}** all types of **[weapons]{.underline}**
**[to]{.underline}** Al Houthis in order to keep fighting against
legitimacy troops and **[ensure that Tehran's mullahs will have a strong
foothold in Yemen]{.underline}**," said Adnan [Mansour, a Yemeni
political expert]{.underline} living in Cairo. The war has pushed the
country to the brink of starvation and spawned the world's worst
humanitarian crisis, according to the UN. The government accuses Al
Houthis of systematically destroying the country's infrastructure
facilities, including the public health system. "[This war will continue
and Yemenis' sufferings will continue as long as the world and the UN
ignore the clear fact that Iran is the real player behind all these
miseries]{.underline}," Mansour told Gulf News. "**[Iran is determined
to expand its influence in the Arab region and extend it to Yemen after
Syria and Lebanon through its proxies]{.underline}**," he added. Arab
nations have long complained of Iranian inteference in their domestic
affairs as well as fomenting sectarian strife in the region. Focus on
Hodeida Since it entered the war, the coalition was able to win back
large swathes of territory from the militants, but main population
centers remain under Al Houthi control. A lightening offensive by Yemeni
forces last year was able to liberate much of the Al Houthi-controlled
territory along strategic Red Sea, but stopped just short of the Hodeida
port, the main conduit for goods and aid. International pressure was
placed on Yemeni forces to pause their assault because of the major
humanitarian concerns such a battle would have. However, the government
says Al Houthis are using the port to illegally smuggle in weapons from
Iran to sustain their military efforts. Nonetheless, government forces
agreed to a halt their offensive, but reserved their right to resume it
if peace talks fail. However, the Sweden deal has since bogged down over
Al Houthis' refusal to withdraw from Hodeida and its three harbours as
the deal stipulates. "[Iran has a hand in aborting the implementation of
the Hodeida agreement]{.underline}," Mansour said. Al Houthis have
recently boasted of their "stock of missiles" and threatened to attack
Saudi Arabia if the Yemeni government forces resumed an offensive to
liberate Hodeida. The Red Sea city in west Yemen is strategically
important because of its main port, through which most the poor
country's imports and humanitarian aid enter. "The UN failure to put
enough pressure on Al Houthi militias and their Iranian patrons harms
credibility of the international organization and the agreements, which
it meditates," Mansour said. "What is the use of peace agreements if
they are not implemented?" he added. [Al Houthis not serious about
peace]{.underline} Over the past four years, UN efforts to end Yemen's
war have gone nowhere. "Al [Houthis have wasted several chances to
peacefully settle the crisis, a matter that confirms they pursue a
project, which they will not renounce]{.underline}," said Hassan Abu
Taleb, an expert at the Cairo-based Al Ahram Centre for Political and
Strategic Studies. "[The international community and the \[UN\] Security
Council appear to have no clear vision about how to deal with Al Houthi
movement,"]{.underline} he added. Abu Taleb points to close links
between the militant group and Iran. "**[Years ago, Iran began its
sectarian, cultural, educational, military and financial engagement in
Al Houthi-majority areas]{.underline}**. Young Al Houthis in Sa'ada \[
the militant stronghold in North Yemen\] often go to Iran where they
receive training at institutions and camps," he said. In recent months,
Al Houthis have stepped up their attacks with Iran-made missiles on
neighbouring Saudi Arabia, which has announced backing for a peaceful
solution to Yemen's crisis.

While the world was fixated on the existential threat of ISIS --- a
terrorist group that controlled mostly rural territory and had limited,
if any, backing by foreign states [--- the Houthi extremists in Yemen
have achieved]{.underline} what their counterparts in Iraq and Syria
could only dream of: [Domination and destabilization]{.underline} of a
country already devastated by poverty, tribal conflict and corruption.
For nearly a decade, the Houthis have controlled large parts of Yemen,
including the capital of one the world's poorest countries. [They have
erected their own terrorist state architecture]{.underline} in Sana'a
[and used their base to launch missile attacks]{.underline} not only on
Riyadh's airport but Abu Dhabi's. And they've done it all with the full
backing of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, which even loaned its Yemeni
proteges the Iranian revolutionary slogan: "[Death to America, Death to
Israel, Curse on the Jews, Victory to Islam]{.underline}." [Evidence of
Iranian military involvement in Yemen has become
overwhelming]{.underline}. Last year U.S. officials presented evidence
that Iran supplied short-range ballistic missiles to Houthi rebels in
Yemen, which then were fired at civilian areas of Saudi Arabia,
targeting nationals of various countries. Even U.N. Secretary General
Antonio Guterres submitted evidence to the Security Council that Iran
was supplying ballistic missiles to Houthi rebels in defiance of U.N.
resolution 2231. But it's not Sana'a --- or even Yemen --- that the
Houthis and their Iranian paymasters are really interested in. It's the
oil shipping routes in the Red Sea, just off Yemen's coast, as indicated
by the Houthi attack on Saudi oil tankers in July which caused the Saudi
kingdom to suspend Red Sea oil shipments, a move that affected the
world's oil markets**[. Iran is an ideologically driven state and its
end-game is, ultimately, to use its proxy occupation of Yemen to control
the global oil supply and weaken its Sunni neighbors]{.underline}**.
That is shocking, but what's worse is that the [Houthis are not taken
seriously in Western capitals]{.underline}. In fact, many
[mainstream]{.underline} newspapers and politicians in the [Western
world have taken a surprisingly favorable tone towards
them.]{.underline} Just last week, a number of French members of
parliament expressed support for the terrorists in the National
Assembly, [despite their control of Hodeida causing famine on an epic
scale]{.underline}. The propaganda value of anti-Saudi sentiment,
currently in vogue in some corridors of Western power, and images of
starving children presented without context has allowed some
opinion-formers to ignore the bigger picture --- that the coalition is
in Yemen fighting terrorism at the request of the Yemeni government and
in the presence of the U.N. It is a bigger picture that we can no longer
afford to ignore, for the sake of Yemen's children. [Amnesty
International has criticized the Houthis for systematically recruiting
child soldiers to fight on the front lines of the conflict]{.underline}.
And the NGO Yemeni Coalition for Monitoring Human Rights Violations
revealed at the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva that the [Houthis
have committed atrocities against thousands of Yemeni civilians,
including women and children**, who have been victims of illegal
executions and death under torture.**]{.underline} This makes it all the
more astounding that the leader of the Houthi organisation, Mohammed Ali
al-Houthi, was last week able to use the Washington Post to communicate
to Western audiences and position himself as a reputable leader. That is
not to suggest we should not strive for peace. But **[to make peace
possible in Yemen, the first step is to recognize the enemy for what it
is: a regionally dominant but globally dangerous Iranian proxy acting as
a terrorist army.]{.underline}** None of this should surprise us;
[Iran's appetite for coordinating terrorist attacks on foreign soil is
well-established]{.underline}. A recent U.S. State Department report
declared that [Iran remains one of the world\'s leading state sponsors
of terrorism]{.underline}, with funding networks and operational cells
working around the world. And, last month, the Belgian and French
governments charged an Iranian diplomat with planning a bomb attack ---
just the latest in a long line of global Iranian terror complicity going
back to the 1983 Beirut attack carried out by the Shiite group
Hezbollah, which killed 241 U.S. Marines. Once we have recognized the
enemy for who they are, we need to combine this with a diplomatic
strategy leveraging key regional mediators, such as Oman, which are
Western allies while also having well-established back channels to
Tehran. For years, Iran has been part of the problem; now we need it to
be part of the solution. But none of this can happen with the continuing
support of Houthi terror and war crimes. [In order to prevent a new
Hezbollah coming to pass in Yemen, we must shut down its fundraising and
supply lines from Iran and its proxies around the world]{.underline}.
**[Failure to do so would be one of the biggest geopolitical --- and
humanitarian --- failures of our time.]{.underline}**

But while the direct target of the Saudi-led coalition is the Houthis,
the indirect target is elsewhere. The (mostly) Sunni Arab intervention
into Yemen is about Shia Persian Iran --- 1,500 miles away. As we know,
[the Iran-backed]{.underline} (Shia) [Houthis are taking it to the
Saudi-supported]{.underline} (Sunni) [Yemeni central
government]{.underline}. [The rebels may]{.underline} seize the city of
Aden as well, Hadi's displaced capital, possibly [turn]{.underline}ing
[Yemen over to an ally of Iran]{.underline}. While Tehran's ties with
the Houthi are murky, [the rebels]{.underline} will need outside support
if they take over the country and [could deepen relations with the
Iranians]{.underline}. **[In other words, an Iranian satellite state on
the Saudi southern border is possible]{.underline}**. [Since
Riyadh]{.underline} (and others) [see Tehran]{.underline} as not only
ambitious in the Middle East and the Muslim world but [as ascendant
in]{.underline} [the region]{.underline} (e.g., Iraq and Syria),
[expansion into Yemen spells "trouble]{.underline}." **[If Yemen becomes
a client state of Iran, Tehran could send the Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps, intelligence and security forces there to assist the
Houthis and advance its interests]{.underline}**. [Iran's naval forces

**[with the largest ballistic missile force in the Middle East, could
also deploy these powerful military assets to Yemen]{.underline}**,
[threatening regional land and sea targets and transit

the potential for plenty of Persian perfidy in Yemen. The coalition is,
of course, worried about the Islamic State and al-Qaeda in the Arabian
Peninsula in Yemen, in light of the death and destruction they're
causing elsewhere, but considering the threat felt from a major power
like Iran, it's likely secondary. [One can't also help but sense the
coalition feels a need to deal with Iran in Yemen because of declining
levels of U.S. regional engagement]{.underline}, a possible warming
between Washington and Tehran over a nuclear deal and increasing Iranian
influence in Syria and Iraq.

Saudi Arabia has already taken an important lead in Yemen that will need
U.S. support. Saudi Arabia and allies are now conducting air strikes in
[Yemen](http://www.reuters.com/places/yemen) to try to halt the advance
of a Houthi militia, with strong ties to Iran, which is attempting to
end President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi\'s efforts to relocate Yemen's
elected government to Aden. [Saudi Arabia has formed a coalition of more
than 10 countries try to protect the Hadi government]{.underline}. It

Bahrain, Kuwait, and Qatar to sign a joint statement supporting Saudi
Arabia's announcement of military action. Moreover, Reuters
[reports](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/26/us-yemen-security-coalition-factbox-idU.S.KBN0MM1A320150326)
that Egypt, Jordan, and Sudan have said they have forces involved in the

Pakistan is considering a Saudi request to send ground forces. Some
reports say that Morocco will send combat aircraft as well. The United
States has already said it would give logistical and intelligence
support, but the situation in Yemen may well come to require more than
that, and some kind of U.S. combat support as well as U.S. diplomatic
pressure on Iran. Once again, the United States is finding out that
calling for strategic partnership is not a way of avoiding its role as a
world power. One cannot establish partnerships without being a partner.
Saudi Arabia as a Strategic Partner To put Yemen in a broader strategic
context, the [crisis in Yemen is only part of the U.S.-Saudi strategic
equation]{.underline}. **[U.S.- Saudi partnership and cooperation is
critical in building some form of deterrence and strategic stability to
contain Iran in the Gulf]{.underline}**. Any nuclear agreement will not
affect the need for close cooperation between the United States, Saudi
Arabia and other key members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in
dealing with the broader and active threat Iran poses in terms of
conventional forces, asymmetric warfare, missiles, and strategic
influence in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and the Gaza Strip. [Saudi Arabia,
the UAE, and Kuwait play a key role in stabilizing Egypt and Jordan, and
U.S., Saudi, and UAE **cooperation in arms transf**ers -- along with

[Yemen is of major strategic importance to the United States, as is the

modern mines that are far superior to the simple World War I-style
contact mines that it used in the 1980s. The mines could be deployed by
Iran's three Kilo-class submarines, various mini-submarines,
helicopters, or small boats disguised as fishing vessels. Iran's Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps naval forces have developed swarming tactics
using fast attack boats and could deploy naval commandos trained to
attack using small boats, mini-submarines, and even Jet Ski-type
watercraft. The Revolutionary Guards also have underwater demolition
teams that could attack docked ships, offshore oil platforms, and other
facilities. In addition to threatening the Strait of Hormuz[, Iran also

mba-alb

The Senate will vote Thursday to override President Trump's veto of a
resolution pulling American support from Yemen. Congress has used
America\'s relationship with Saudi Arabia as a reason for the
resolution, but the Yemen issue is much broader. [The outcome of the
Yemen war has national security and economic implications for the United
States,]{.underline} Europe and the world [because of the strategic
importance of the Bab el-Mandeb Strait]{.underline}. [The Bab el-Mandeb
Strait is a major oil chokepoint and a strategic link between the Indian
Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea]{.underline}. **[Any disruption to the
security and control of the strait could lead to major global shifts in
oil prices]{.underline}**. The Energy Information Administration (EIA)
estimates that in 2016, 4.8 million barrels of crude and petroleum
products flowed through the strait each day, with about 2.8 million
going north to Europe, and another two million moving in the opposite
direction. [If the U.S. pulls support]{.underline} for the Gulf powers
in the Yemen conflict, [the Iran-backed Houthi Shiite rebels could gain
control of one of the world's busiest shipping routes.]{.underline}
According to the EIA, [closing the Bab el-Mandeb Strait could keep
tankers]{.underline} in the Persian Gulf [from reaching the Suez
Canal]{.underline} and the SUMED Pipeline, [diverting them
around]{.underline} the southern tip of [Africa]{.underline}, adding
transit time and cost. The Bab el-Mandeb Strait is only 18 miles at its
narrowest point. Tankers passing through must use two two-mile-wide
shipping channels, leaving it extremely vulnerable to disruption. [As
the relationship between the U.S. and Iran grows increasingly tense,
Iran's control over global waterways, including the Strait of Hormuz,
becomes more important]{.underline}. **[Iran is using, and will use, any
and all leverage it has over the United States]{.underline}**, **[so it
is vital not to hand over any additional advantages]{.underline}**.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif warned over the weekend of
possible consequences for the U.S. administration's decision to stop
issuing waivers to countries for Iranian oil imports. The Strait of
Hormuz is the world's primary oil chokepoint with an estimated record of
18.5 million barrels per day of oil passing through it in 2016.
According to the EIA, the Strait of Hormuz accounted for 30 percent of
all sea-borne-traded crude oil and other liquids in 2015. The danger
posed by Iranian expansion and overall malign actions in the region is
the greater problem. [They want to gain access to the Red Sea and
control vital economic waterways]{.underline}. Why [give Iran the
opportunity to provide missiles and other armaments to the Houthis to
control yet another primary oil chokepoint in the Bab el-Mandeb
Strait]{.underline}? As Iran moves closer to securing the port of
Latakia in Syria (gaining direct access to the Mediterranean Sea and to
the Israeli border), the conflict in Yemen becomes of even greater
importance to the U.S. and Europe. President Trump's recent
[veto]{.underline} of the Yemen War resolution passed by Congress was
the right decision. It [was a necessary step toward countering Iran's
hegemonic ambitions in the region]{.underline}. **[The global value of
the Bab el-Mandeb Strait also correlates with the relational value of
the small country of Djibouti where the U.S. Africa Command's Camp
Lemonnier, the only U.S. base of operations for Africa,]{.underline}**
supporting 4,000 U.S. joint and allied forces. [Djibouti is located on
the Bab el-Mandeb Strait]{.underline} which separates Yemen from Africa;
and, is also home to China's first overseas military base formally
opened in 2017. China has economic and strategic interest in Africa with
decades of soft-power investments. Beijing has invested billions through
their Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) throughout Africa and the world in
infrastructure projects. Seventy-seven percent of Djibouti's debt is
held by Chinese lenders, giving China strong economic leverage over the
small country. Last month, U.S. Africa Command\'s Gen. Thomas Waldhauser
stated during testimony before the House Armed Services Committee that
the U.S. needs a higher level of political engagement in Africa to
counter China's growing influence. China's economic and military
leverage in Djibouti could hinder access to the port that provides
military support to Camp Lemonneir. Reports of Djibouti handing over
control of the Doraleh Container Terminal (DCT) to Chinese state-owned
enterprises has raised alarm with U.S. lawmakers and defense officials.
The DCT is a strategically-located shipping port on the Red Sea, the
primary containerized cargo facility in Djibouti. In December 2018,
National Security Advisor John Bolton, in his remarks on the Trump
administration's New Africa Strategy, highlighted China and Russia's
rapidly expanding financial and political influence across Africa.
\"they are deliberately and aggressively targeting their investments in
the region to gain a competitive advantage over the United States,\"
Bolton said. He added that from 2016-17, \"China's foreign direct
investment toward Africa totaled \$6.4 billion dollars. And, over the
past several years, China has devoted considerable state-directed and
state-supported financing to projects in the region.\" He warned of
China's \"ultimate goal of advancing Chinese global dominance" and a
"quest to obtain more political, economic, and military power.\"
Congress has a duty to protect the economic and national security of the
United States. As the Senate plans to take up President Trump's veto,
hopefully senators will consider the greater strategic importance of the
conflict and not only focus on Saudi Arabia --- because the outcome of
the war could have vast ramifications for the United States and the
world.

Yemen has become the latest battleground in a regional intra-religious
semi-cold war between the Sunni Arab states, nominally led by Saudi
Arabia, and the Shiite-dominated Islamic Republic of Iran. [The stakes
are high as the two sides compete for primacy in a region that is home
to a large portion of the world's essential energy supply]{.underline},
as [well as a transit point for some of the world's most important
maritime trading routes]{.underline}. **[Should the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[get cold feet in Yemen
and abandon its Saudi allies, then, it will ensure Iran becomes the
region's new powerhouse]{.underline}**. [Currently]{.underline}, [Houthi
rebels]{.underline}---[who]{.underline} [are nothing more than pro-Iran
malcontents]{.underline}---[seek to dominate Yemen]{.underline}, turning
it away from a pro-Saudi (and therefore moderately pro-American) country
into a decidedly anti-American one. Those who worry about the
humanitarian costs of the conflict are not wrong. They may be extensive.
Yet, Washington must always concern itself with what's in America's
national interest first. Yemen becoming a pro-Iranian enclave is more of
a grave concern for us than the fact that the country's civil war has
become a shameful humanitarian disaster. Take, for instance, [the fact
that Yemen's coastline straddles some of the world's busiest maritime
trading routes]{.underline}. [In particular, the Bab-el-Mandeb
strait]{.underline}, [which connects the Red Sea with the Gulf of
Aden]{.underline} (and the wider Indian Ocean). Yemen is also just
across---separated by the waterway---from Djibouti (where China now has
some of its most important overseas military bases). Regional Stability
At Stake [When the internationally recognized, pro-Saudi regime ruled
Yemen, global stability was assured]{.underline}, [as]{.underline} vital
[trade occurred]{.underline} [unabated]{.underline}. [With the civil war
having gone on for years and Iran intensifying its commitment to the
Houthi rebels, the Saudis may lose their client in Yemen]{.underline}.
**[With that the entire regional order would be destabilized
further]{.underline}**. Consider this: [most of the trade passing
through the Bab-el-Mandeb either emanates from or travels to Egypt's
Suez Canal]{.underline}---meaning that [as Yemen goes, so goes 8 percent
of the world's trade]{.underline}. **[And as Yemen becomes a major
destabilizer along the Bab-el-Mandeb, the stability of the far more
crucial Egypt will be]{.underline}** **[next]{.underline}**. Consider,
too, that the Egyptian economy receives roughly \$5 billion a year from
maritime trade passing near Yemen's coastline. Cairo anticipates an
increase in trade revenue to around \$13 billion by 2023. [One of the
primary causes of the Arab Spring]{.underline}---which brought on the
overthrow of the pro-American autocrat, Hosni Mubarak, and replaced him
with an ardent member of the Muslim Brotherhood, Mohammed Morsi, until
the military took him out---[was Egypt's dire economic
situation]{.underline}. **[Imagine what depriving Egypt of such
important maritime trade could do to the political stability of Egypt
and the wider region]{.underline}**. More important for our own
interests is the fact that [four percent of the world's oil supply
passes through the strait]{.underline}. While some have proposed
[reopening old]{.underline} [pipelines]{.underline} to lessen the
world's dependence on the Bab-el-Mandeb, as I argued several months ago,
this [is]{.underline} simply [not a viable possibility]{.underline}.
Yes, old pipelines could offset some of the economic damage. But no
matter what, pipelines alone could not offset the loss of this waterway
(at least not in the near-term). Therefore, [transportation]{.underline}
of oil [would become more costly]{.underline} and the overall costs to
consumers worldwide would increase. No Concessions to Iran **[By not
fighting in Yemen, Saudi Arabia all but concedes the region to an
empowered Iran.]{.underline}** The Iranians already enjoy the ability to
threaten global trade closer to their shores, in the even more important
Strait of Hormuz. [Should Iran gain a strategic foothold in Yemen, the
mullahs would be able to threaten yet another maritime choke point
i]{.underline}n the Bab-el-Mandeb. Iran would also have another place to
target its medium-range missiles at the Sunni world---and **[losing
Yemen would compel Saudi Arabia to fulfill its threat of purchasing a
stockpile of nuclear weapons from Pakistan]{.underline}**. No one should
want Riyadh, with its large population of Islamists, to possess even one
nuclear weapon. The Trump Administration has rightly pointed out the
threat to the world that Iran poses. This is the reason for Trump having
abandoned the ill-advised nuclear deal that former President Obama made
with Iran in 2015. While not wanting to commit more American forces to
another Mideast quagmire, President Trump astutely recognizes that the
United States doesn't have the luxury of simply abandoning the region.
If it leaves forthwith, as some on both the American Left and even on
the Right seem intent on doing, then other, less savory powers---such as
Iran, but also Russia and China---would happily move in to dominate the
world's energy flows and major maritime trading routes. Thus, Trump has
decided to empower the Sunni Arab states (led by Saudi Arabia) as well
as Israel to contain Iran. Abandoning the Saudi cause in Yemen means
abandoning Saudi Arabia, which, in turn, means abandoning Israel, which
all but assures Iran becomes the region's new master. Virtually
overnight, then, the entire American alliance system collapses, as
others in the region compete to curry favor with the region's new
masters and abandon the United States. Meanwhile, farther afield, other
twitchy allies might start wondering whether they'll be abandoned in
their hour of need. While America should be more judicious about our
alliances, we still cannot allow for our allies (and enemies) to believe
we're seeking to abandon the world; that would be against our interests.
Unfortunately, for now, the United States must either support Saudi
Arabia or watch as Iran empowers itself---and threatens the United
States.

For its part, [Iran likely hopes to wait out the Trump

escalation]{.underline}**. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[currently operates in close proximity in several theaters]{.underline}
(particularly Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria) and areas (namely, the
Persian Gulf). U.S. forces remain present on the ground in countries
[where Tehran has built an extensive presence]{.underline} by working
through non-state clients. However, the **[two countries no longer have
formal channels of communication or an off-ramp to de-escalate
tensions]{.underline}**. As a result, **[the slightest
miscalculation]{.underline}** or misunderstanding [**can quickly
spiral**. In the past, such channels have been vital to the management
of complicated matters]{.underline}. For example, [in 2016,
when]{.underline} U.S. [sailors]{.underline} [entered]{.underline}
[Iranian waters by mistake]{.underline}, leading to their capture by
Iran\'s paramilitary Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, [channels of
communication]{.underline} between Washington and Tehran
[secured]{.underline} their quick [release]{.underline}. Today, no such
channel is available and **[a similar incident could add more tensions
and lead to escalation between the two nations]{.underline}**. The
recent augmentation of U.S. military assets and capabilities in the gulf
may also increase the chances of miscalculation. In addition to the
carrier strike group and bomber task force, a squadron of F-35 fighters
recently deployed to Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates.
Iran may view the change in U.S. posture and uptick in U.S. capability
as offensive in nature. Such [misperception could raise the risk of
escalation**, as Iran might feel compelled to take steps in response to
stave off what it sees as a threat**]{.underline}. Moreover, the
statement over the weekend stressed that [any attack by
Iran]{.underline} or its proxies [on U.S. interests]{.underline} or
those of its allies [would be met with a response]{.underline}. **[This
not only sets U.S. red lines but also broadens the aperture of what
would beget a U.S. military response]{.underline}**. U.S. forces are
still located at Al-Tanf in Syria, in close proximity to Iran and
Iran-backed forces. Meanwhile, in Iraq, the Iranian-backed popular
mobilization units are no longer working in conjunction with U.S. and
Iraqi forces as their common adversary, ISIS, has ostensibly been
defeated. Given the lack of a shared enemy and the proximity of U.S.
forces to Iranian clients, it is not far-fetched to imagine an attack on
U.S. troops in either country. Th[e inclusion of allied interests in the
White House statement may also provide additional risks for
escalation]{.underline}. In the past, U.S. [partners]{.underline} such
as Israel and Saudi Arabia [have called]{.underline} for the United
States [to take action]{.underline} against Iran, threatening to "go it
alone" when Washington did not agree. While national security adviser
John Bolton\'s statement may have been intended to reassure nervous
partners in the region, it ostensibly makes the U.S. party to any proxy
attack on a partner. [This may create a slippery slope whereby the
United States is dragged into conflict]{.underline} as proxy attacks on
partners---such as Houthi missile attacks on Riyadh in response to the
Saudi-led war in Yemen---are not uncommon. In fact, Iran may use its
clients to further flex its muscles in the region not just to deter what
they believe to be an aggressive American build-up in their backyard,
but also to placate constituents at home. [In the year since the Trump
administration withdrew from the nuclear deal, pressure has mounted in
Iran forcing the Rouhani government to adopt a harder line]{.underline}
in its policy [vis-à-vis the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. As a result, in recent weeks, [Iran has started to
flex its muscles more]{.underline} as its "strategic patience" has been
exacerbated. Recent nuclear and regional activities---including the
announcement that Tehran would no longer be bound by some terms of the
nuclear agreement and reported use of proxies to target American
interests in the region---may be the first such actions, leading the two
countries down the path of confrontation. **[While neither Tehran nor
Washington may be seeking a conflict, they have taken a number of
actions that have made confrontation more]{.underline}**, rather than
less, **[likely by increasing the risks of misperception, miscalculation
and misunderstanding]{.underline}**. [But conflict is not
inevitable]{.underline}. The United States and Iran could seek to
re-establish communications channels, as well as look for available
off-ramps in order to de-escalate tensions and keep the slightest
misstep from spiraling into an all-out conflict.

of diplomacy by the U.S." Trump responded with a series of tweets on
Tuesday, including: Iran's very ignorant and insulting statement, put
out today, only shows that they do not understand reality. Any attack by
Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force.
In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration. No more John Kerry &
Obama! John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser, blamed Iran for
dragging its feet on diplomacy: The president has held the door open to
real negotiations to completely and verifiably eliminate Iran's nuclear
weapons program, its pursuit of ballistic missile delivery systems, its
support for international terrorism, and other malign behavior
worldwide. All that Iran needs to do is to walk through that open door.
Maximum Pressure vs. Maximum Blackmail [The]{.underline} [slow-motion
confrontation]{.underline} between Iran and the U.S. [is]{.underline}
dramatically [accelerating]{.underline} [as the Trump administration's
"maximum pressure" campaign takes effect]{.underline}, **[forcing Tehran
to pay an increasingly painful price for its hostile foreign
policy]{.underline}** [and refusal to return to nuclear
negotiations]{.underline}. The World Bank estimates that [Iran is on
track for negative 4.5% r]{.underline}eal [gross domestic
product]{.underline} growth---the second-worst projection in the world
on a key metric of economic health[. Iran's inflation rate has risen
sharply]{.underline} from about 10% in mid-2018 to about 52% in April
2019, as the [Iranian rial plummets in value]{.underline} and private
spending contracts. Clearly, **[U.S. sanctions have had a devastating
impact]{.underline}**, even without European support. Extensive economic
sanctions against Iran were initially announced in Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo's first major policy speech, which was given at The Heritage
Foundation in May 2018. The new policy, he promised, would impose
"unprecedented financial pressure" against Tehran unless it "halted its
uranium enrichment program and hostile regional policies[." Unwilling to
give up on either, Iran is now paying an escalating price for its brazen
commitment to fomenting instability]{.underline} and violence in the
Middle East and beyond. **[Now barred from export markets]{.underline}**
and the international banking system, **[the mullahs are slowly being
denied the resources they need to continue funding essential parts of
their dangerous agenda.]{.underline}** [Tehran's draft
budget]{.underline} for 2019-2020 [is evidence]{.underline} [of a regime
on the ropes]{.underline}: Among its many [austerity
measures]{.underline}, the regime planned to implement a [28% cut
in]{.underline} [funding]{.underline} [to]{.underline} its
[military]{.underline} budget, [including a 17% reduction
for]{.underline} the [Revolutionary Guard]{.underline}, [which the State
Department rightly designated as a foreign terrorist]{.underline}
organization this April. **[That's a significant blow for the
Revolutionary Guard]{.underline}**, [which is a core part of Iran's
grand strategy]{.underline}, charged with acting as the sword and shield
of Iran's Islamic revolution. Iran's Shadow War The Revolutionary Guard
carried out a series of attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman over
the past two months, attacks that are part of Iran's policy of pushing
back against U.S. sanctions with veiled threats against Arab oil
exporters and the flow of gulf oil. On May 12, four oil tankers carrying
oil exports from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates---two
adversaries that stood to gain materially by providing alternatives to
Iranian oil---were sabotaged with limpet mines. [After Washington
sanctioned Iran's petrochemical exports,]{.underline} two petrochemical
tankers carrying Arab petrochemical exports were sabotaged with limpet
mines on June 13, and [Revolutionary Guard personnel were videotaped
removing an unexploded limpet mine from the hull of one of the ships by
a U.S. Navy helicopter.]{.underline} To minimize the chances of further
embarrassing revelations, the Revolutionary Guard then shot down a U.S.
Navy surveillance drone on June 19 and falsely claimed it had strayed
into Iranian air space. [The Revolutionary Guard's low-intensity warfare
is a calibrated, semi-clandestine campaign of intimidation]{.underline}
aimed at expanding Tehran's leverage by signaling resistance, exploiting
the vulnerability of gulf oil exports, and threatening to escalate
threats against Arab oil-exporting countries aligned with the United
States. The goal is [to force the Trump administration to back
down]{.underline} [from its maximum pressure campaign]{.underline} and
drive a wedge between the U.S. and its European allies, which Tehran
hopes will be motivated to help shield Iran from U.S. sanctions. **[But
this blackmail campaign is unlikely to succeed.]{.underline}** [Iran's
attacks on oil tankers will not boost its own oil exports or solve its
sanctions problems]{.underline}, **[though they could
backfire]{.underline}** spectacularly [by triggering]{.underline} a
costly war with the United States or a [diplomatic backlash]{.underline}
by oil-importing countries threatened by Iran's oil blackmail tactics.
**[Trump, secure in the knowledge that his strategy is paying dividends
by penalizing Iran's hostile policies, has doubled down on his pressure
campaign by imposing new economic sanctions and approving]{.underline}**
**[U.S. cyberattacks]{.underline}** agai[nst Revolutionary
Guard]{.underline} military [computers]{.underline} that control rocket
and missile launchers. **[Disabling Iranian missile sites through
cyberattacks, rather than conventional military attacks, has several
advantages]{.underline}**. [It underscores to Tehran that it is
vulnerable to additional counter-threats]{.underline}, [casts doubt on
its military capabilities, and helps reassure nervous U.S.
allies]{.underline} [that Washington seeks a diplomatic resolution, not
a war with Iran]{.underline}. Still, Iran's ruthless regime remains on a
collision course with the United States. If it continues to reject
diplomacy in favor of violence and intimidation, then a military clash
and perhaps a full-scale war is increasingly likely.

None of the world's truly bad guys stays out the headlines for long.
[After keeping a relatively low profile for several months,
Iran]{.underline} earlier this week [found itself back in the news
twice.]{.underline} First came reports that U.S. National Security
Adviser John Bolton asked the Pentagon last year for military options to
respond to two Iranian-sponsored terrorist acts in Iraq. Then came news
of a failed Iranian missile launch. Iran claimed it was merely sending
up a satellite, but U.S. officials said the failed launch was part of
Iran's effort to test and expand its ballistic missile weapons
capability. [While Iran is back in the headlines now, it's the months
when it was out of the news that may tell us more about what the regime
is up to]{.underline}. [Clearly, the Iranian regime did not see the
changed policies of President Trump coming]{.underline}*.* [Iran got a
sweetheart deal]{.underline} [from]{.underline} the [Obama]{.underline}
administration to temporarily put its nuclear weapons program on hold.
[In addition, the Iranian regime watched]{.underline} President [Obama
draw and then ignore red lines]{.underline} in Syria, [and pursue
ambivalent policies in Syria and Iraq]{.underline} until ISIS erupted
and could no longer be ignored. And Iran saw President Obama soft-peddle
the U.S. alliance with Israel, so that America might appear more
even-handed in dealing the Palestinians. [Beyond the kinder, gentler
treatment from America that it received from the Obama administration,
the Iranian regime also received a grand new opportunity for meddling:
the war in Yemen]{.underline}. Yes, **[times were good for Tehran during
the Obama years as it pursued its goal of expanding influence by
destabilizing the rest of its region]{.underline}**. Then President
Trump ruined the party. Once in office, President Trump began
systematically turning around U.S. policy. And, make no mistake, this
was all Trump. The strategy to put Iran back in its box started long
before long-time Iran skeptics like Bolton joined his administration and
before Pompeo moved from his job as CIA director to head the State
Department. The White House laid out a new approach for dealing with
Tehran in the 2017 National Security Strategy and has followed it to the
letter ever since. Pompeo's recent Cairo speech simply reaffirmed that
the administration sees Iran as chief troublemaker in the greater Middle
East. President [Trump's strategy has made the mullahs
miserable]{.underline}. The U.S. withdrawal from Obama's nuclear deal
has dealt a series of hammer blows to Iran's economy. **[Even Tehran
admits the new U.S. sanctions are hitting hard]{.underline}**. At the
same time, **[anti-regime protests and strikes continue throughout the
country]{.underline}**. [**Iran is also getting multinational pushback
on every** **front**]{.underline} [from funding the Houthi rebels in
Yemen to supporting Shiite militias in Iraq]{.underline}. The Iranian
government, while unhappy, remains as obstreperous as ever. Iranian
Foreign Mohammad Javad Zarif recently went after Poland for agreeing to
host a "U.S. anti-Iran conference" in February. And the mullahs who rule
Iran continue to play hostage diplomacy. An American citizen with a
valid Iranian visa disappeared in July. Later, he reappeared --
inexplicably in an Iranian prison --the fourth American now being held
by the regime. Tehran also continues to arm and supply Hamas, Hezbollah,
the Houthi rebels, and Shiite militias in Iraq. Further afield, it keeps
plotting terrorist attacks in Europe. **[Yet, while Iran sticks to its
usual bad habits, it hasn't tried anything bold -- like]{.underline}**
**[trying to close the Straits of Hormuz]{.underline}**. Nor has the
regime gone directly after U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. And while
Iran's nuclear chief has announced plans to start designing a new
nuclear enrichment process, the regime has not -- so far as we know --
actually increased nuclear enrichment. It still allows International
Atomic Energy Agency inspectors into the country. For now, it looks like
Iran's plan is to take former Obama Secretary of State John Kerry's
advice and just wait Trump out[. The mullahs hope is that in two years
they will get a new U.S. president who will drop the sanctions and beg
to re-up Obama's nuclear deal]{.underline}. Tehran is also watching
closely to see how North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un handles Trump. If
Kim can wrangle a sweetheart deal and keep his nukes, then the Iranian
regime may reason: worst case scenario, Trump is re-elected, we'll
follow Kim's playbook and shoot for a similar arrangement in the future.
**[Meanwhile, we can expect Iran to keep probing for weakness and
advantage -- without provoking the kind of escalatory confrontation with
the West that would put Iran in a real bind]{.underline}**. And so the
Iranians will press the Europeans, make trouble in their region,
name-call -- and wait and see. [Yet while pursuing these foreign
initiatives, the Iranian government must also somehow weather domestic
opposition, a weak economy and an inevitable change in
leadership]{.underline} after Iranian Supreme Leader Grand Ayatollah
Sayyid Ali Hosseini Khamenei, 79, goes to the great beyond. Perhaps none
of this will go well for the mullahs. What if Trump gets re-elected,
North Korea has to denuclearize, and Iran's economy and influence
continue to ebb? It's not out of the question. Too bad for the mullahs.

#### Designation of the revolutionary guard proves

[In a historic move on Monday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced
the designation of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign
terrorist organization. This is the first time the U.S. has given the
designation to part of a government. The **designation will enable the
U.S. to further ramp up sanctions against Iran's tyrannical regime under
the administration's "maximum pressure" policy**. The Revolutionary
Guard Corps is both the sword and shield of Iran's Islamic revolution,
dating back to 1979]{.underline}. It is charged with attacking Iran's
enemies overseas[, supporting Iran's network of foreign terrorist
proxies, and crushing political opposition to Iran's revolutionary
regime at home. Last week, the]{.underline} Pentagon released an updated
assessment that blamed Iran's Revolutionary Guard for enabling Iraqi
proxy forces to kill 603 American serviceme[n in Iraq.]{.underline} That
accounts for about 17% of the total deaths of U.S. personnel from 2003
to 2011[.]{.underline} The Revolutionary Guard also controls Iran's
ballistic missile program[, military aspects of its nuclear program, and
key portions of Iran's state-dominated economy. The designation as a
foreign terrorist organization will become effective next Monday, at
which time the U.S. government will gain additional tools for applying
sanctions against the Revolutionary Guards and all foreign entities that
do business with them, their subsidiaries, and their front companies.
**This will allow U.S. sanctions to hit harder at strategic sectors of
Iran's economy**, since the Revolutionary Guard is extensively involved
in Iran's oil, construction, and defense industries. As CIA director in
2017, Pompeo estimated that the Revolutionary Guard controlled about 20%
of Iran's economy. **These added sanctions will drain away resources
that could be used to export terrorism**, thus helping bolster the
security of the U.S. and its allies. This will also benefit the Iranian
people, who are the chief victims of the Revolutionary Guard. The new
sanctions also will ratchet up pressure on foreign firms that continue
to do business with Iran. Such firms could now face prosecution in U.S.
courts for providing material support for terrorism if they engage in
commerce with Iranian entities affiliated with the Revolutionary Guard.
President Donald Trump hammered this point home in a White House
statement Monday when he warned: "If you are doing business with the
\[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\], you will be bankrolling
terrorism." He also made it clear that more Iran sanctions are coming**:
This action sends a clear message to Tehran that its support for
terrorism has serious consequences**. **We will continue to increase
financial pressure and raise the costs on the Iranian regime for its
support of terrorist activity until it abandons its malign and outlaw
behavior**. **This added pressure on Iran's economy is sure to put
greater stress on the Iranian regime,** which already faces growing
discontent from Iranians. The Trump administration hopes that stronger
sanctions will compel Tehran to moderate its hostile policies or risk
being overthrown by its own people.]{.underline}

The **[current Saudi assertiveness is]{.underline}** less a result of

external assertiveness to build his internal reputation]{.underline}**.
The potential weakness of the Saudi regime adds a layer of complexity
and unpredictability to the analysis. It can be argued that the
increased fragmentation and the bilateral character of relationships
based on transactional cost-benefit analysis has increased the
importance of personal relationships. 29 Moreover, it could be argued
that [the direct and personal linkage of Muhammed bin Salman to the

difficult for the Saudis to withdraw without a]{.underline}, at least,

The Saudi-led intervention into Yemen [The]{.underline} 2015
[intervention]{.underline} in Yemen [illustrates the interaction between
the internal and external]{.underline} [dimensions]{.underline} of Saudi
policy. **[MBS]{.underline}** has voiced a desire for the Kingdom to be
more assertive in shaping events in the Middle East and countering the
influence of Iran. 16 He [**made the intervention** into Yemen the
symbol of his assertive foreign policy and thus,]{.underline} [**a key
element in strengthening his position as the successor to the crown in
the face of substantial internal challenges.** The intervention was
initially popular]{.underline} within Saudi Arabia [and]{.underline} as
such [presented an opportunity to project]{.underline} an image of
[strong and decisive leadership and M]{.underline}ohammed
[b]{.underline}in [S]{.underline}alman [as a man of action]{.underline}.
[It boosted a sense of Saudi nationalism as it was framed as Saudi
Arabia taking a strong stance against the perceived continued
encroachments of Iran.]{.underline} [MBS has resisted changing policy
even as the intervention failed]{.underline} to achieve rapid or
decisive victory and has played a substantial role in pushing Yemen
towards what the UN refer to as the world's current worst humanitarian
crisis. 17 Te uprising in Yemen in 2011, that forced the president of
33-years, Ali Abdullah Saleh to resign, ended with a negotiated
transition guided by the so-called GCC Agreement. Te agreement was
criticized for being overly focused on stabilization as it largely
retained the status quo for the political elites of the country. 18
While the UN supported political negotiations went ahead in Sana'a as
stipulated in the GCC agreement, tensions were growing as the economy
and security situation continued to deteriorate. In September 2014, the
Houthis militarily seized control of the Yemeni capital, Sana'a,
facilitated by a deal with the former president Saleh who continued to
wield substantial influence. Although the Houthis framed these events as
a continuation of the 2011 revolution, the Houthis became increasingly
unwilling to share power, leading to the flight of the interim but
internationally recognized President Hadi from Sana'a in early 2015. 19
In March 2015, the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen commenced
with the aim of reversing the Houthi takeover and return Hadi to power.
Tere is an often told story of how, while on his deathbed, the founder
of Saudi Arabia, King Abdulaziz bin Abdulrahman al-Saud, warned his sons
that "the good or evil for us will come from Yemen."20 Whether true or
not, the story illustrates how Saudi Arabia's approach to Yemen has been
shaped by a focus on containing the perceived security risk emanating
from Yemen. The stated objective of the Saudi-led intervention was "to
defend the legitimate government of President Hadi" who had requested
help based on article 51 of the UN Charter. 21 Te intervention has also
been legitimized through the right to self-defense. Te Saudis
consistently refer to the Houthis as an Iranianbacked militia. In the
Saudi narrative, the Houthis not only threaten the Yemeni population but
also Saudi Arabia itself. The Houthis have carried out numerous cross
border attacks and at several occasions launched missiles deep into
Saudi territory. Saudi Arabia see the Houthis as Iran's pro-longed arm
and has presented the intervention as necessary to prevent a regional
plot that threatened to destabilize the Arabian Peninsula. **[22 The
linkage of the intervention to the regional rivalry with Iran -- as well
as the way MBS has made Yemen a symbol of his foreign policy -- has made
it difficult for the Saudis to either withdraw or accept a negotiated
peace deal that would see the Houthis sustain substantial political and
military influence in Yemen]{.underline}**. Thus, whereas Saudi Arabia
could relatively unscathed withdraw from their intervention in Yemen in
2009 despite it being framed as largely unsuccessful, [it seems unlikely
that Muhammed bin Salman will accept, or be able to accept, withdrawal
from the current intervention into Yemen without being able to at least
symbolically declaring the war a victory]{.underline}. The international
context does less to explain the Yemen intervention than the regional or
domestic levels. Both Obama and Trump supported the Saudi-led
intervention into Yemen. Te Obama administration largely backed the
intervention in order to support an ally at a time of considerable
intra-alliance tension. Te US has limited direct interest in Yemen
beyond concerns over terrorism, and have a well-established tradition of
approaching the perceived anarchy of Yemen through airstrikes. 23 While
the Obama administration supported the intervention relatively quietly,
the Trump administration has widely adopted the narrative of the Houthis
as Iranian puppets. 24 Te combination of improved personal relations
between Trump and Mohammed bin Salman, which is undergirded by a shared
perception of Iran as the biggest threat in the region, and an American
desire to delegate to regional allies, has worked to give Saudi Arabia
free reigns in Yemen. Tus, the Saudis have carried out the military
operations in Yemen with U.S.- trained Saudi personnel with U.S.
logistical assistance, and shared intelligence using U.S.-origin
weaponry. 25 Tere is an economic dimension as well. Te Yemen war has
become "a huge financial boon for American and British defense
contractors (and their shareholders)" despite concerns over the
humanitarian crisis. 26 Trump has underlined that the bilateral
relationship between the US and KSA is transactional and that a key
component of this is that the Saudis arms purchases move forward. 27
However, as civilian casualties mount in Yemen, there has been increased
internal pressure on the Trump administration to limit arms sales to
Saudi Arabia. Tese have so far been unsuccessful although recent events
following the murder of the Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, seem to
have led to some, at least rhetorical, changes in the Trump
administration's approach to the Saudi intervention in Yemen. 28 Tere is
no doubt that the US is a key partner for Saudi Arabia as outlined
above, but events also demonstrate that the US cannot dictate the
policies of Saudi Arabia.

strategic interests require a broad level of **stability** in the Gulf
and Arabian Peninsula]{.underline} [and]{.underline} one that **[is
dependent on Saudi Arabia as a key strategic partner]{.underline}**.
Saudi Arabia has already taken an important lead in Yemen that will need
U.S. support. Saudi Arabia and allies are now conducting air strikes in
[Yemen](http://www.reuters.com/places/yemen) to try to halt the advance
of a Houthi militia, with strong ties to Iran, which is attempting to
end President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi\'s efforts to relocate Yemen's
elected government to Aden. [Saudi Arabia has formed a coalition of more
than 10 countries try to protect the Hadi government]{.underline}. It
has also taken the lead in getting the United Arab Emirates (UAE),
Bahrain, Kuwait, and Qatar to sign a joint statement supporting Saudi
Arabia's announcement of military action. Moreover, Reuters
[reports](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/26/us-yemen-security-coalition-factbox-idU.S.KBN0MM1A320150326)
that Egypt, Jordan, and Sudan have said they have forces involved in the
operation; that Sudan has pledged ground troops and warplanes; and that
Pakistan is considering a Saudi request to send ground forces. Some
reports say that Morocco will send combat aircraft as well. The United
States has already said it would give logistical and intelligence
support, but the situation in Yemen may well come to require more than
that, and some kind of U.S. combat support as well as U.S. diplomatic
pressure on Iran. Once again, the United States is finding out that
calling for strategic partnership is not a way of avoiding its role as a
world power. One cannot establish partnerships without being a partner.
Saudi Arabia as a Strategic Partner To put Yemen in a broader strategic
context, the [crisis in Yemen is only part of the U.S.-Saudi strategic
equation]{.underline}. **[U.S.- Saudi partnership and cooperation is
critical in building some form of deterrence and strategic stability to
contain Iran in the Gulf]{.underline}**. Any nuclear agreement will not
affect the need for close cooperation between the United States, Saudi
Arabia and other key members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in
dealing with the broader and active threat Iran poses in terms of
conventional forces, asymmetric warfare, missiles, and strategic
influence in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and the Gaza Strip. [Saudi Arabia,

[Yemen is of major strategic importance to the United States, as is the

understandable, but misplaced. Although limited, American influence has
shaped both Saudi and Emirati actions for the better. The US could do
even more to shape their behavior if it engaged more seriously in the
effort. Instead of retreating in disgust, the US must work to extricate
its partners from Yemen by actively pursuing a long-term political
resolution and using its considerable leverage with them to rein in the
worst aspects of their own practices and inclinations.

#### Saudi is one of the richest nations -- they have spare capacity of untapped oil that ensures they purchase weapons from other countries

**John 19** -- (Steven, "12 mind-blowing facts about Saudi Arabia\'s
economy" Market Business Insider, May 2, 2019,
<https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/saudi-arabia-economy-facts-2019-5-1028161696#saudi-arabia-has-more-than-34-trillion-worth-of-natural-resources-1>)//RP

[The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]{.underline} was officially founded in
1932, and in the nearly nine decades since its establishment, it **[has
grown into one of the wealthiest nations]{.underline}** on Earth. This
is almost entirely thanks to the nation\'s extensive oil and natural gas
reserves, though [Saudi Arabia has]{.underline} also [made strides
in]{.underline} other areas of **[economic activity]{.underline}**, such
as agricultural production. While recent news stories centered on Saudi
Arabia and its ruling House of Saud have shined a light on the
kingdom\'s darker side, the greater population of this Arabian nation
has much of which to be proud. [Saudi Arabia boasts a long, rich
history, it has made recent economic advances that pave the way for a
prosperous future,]{.underline} women\'s rights are slowly expanding,
and it is home to a number of top-rated universities. Despite its
reputation as a global economic powerhouse, thanks to its vast natural
resources, a closer look at the Saudi economy reveals a more nuanced
picture of the kingdom. From its military spending to its population of
foreign workers, here are 12 surprising facts about Saudi Arabia\'s
economy: [**Saudi Arabia has more than \$34 trillion worth of natural
resources.** Saudi Arabia sits on approximately 20% of the planet\'s
known oil reserves, and it is this oil that constitutes the bulk of the
kingdom\'s natural-resource wealth]{.underline}. Saudi Arabia also
possesses appreciable stores of copper, silver, phosphate, and several
other resources. [Saudi Arabia is home to the most profitable company in
the world]{.underline} With reported profits topping \$111 billion in
2018, [Saudi Aramco is believed to be the most-profitable company in the
world.]{.underline} The staggering net income of the state-owned oil
company was higher than those of Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet combined.
Saudi Aramco has toyed with going public for years, but after the
company attracted \$100 billion in bids at its bond offering, an IPO
appears to have been put on hold. While presently accounting for about
90% of the Saudi economy, oil was not discovered there until 1938.
Though Saudi Arabia sits on what is believed to be the world\'s
second-largest stores of oil, none was discovered there until 1938. In
that year, prospectors working for California-based Standard Oil finally
struck a reserve. The company would manage Saudi production until 1980,
when the Saudi royal family took over operations. Today, oil production
provides more than 90% of the nation\'s wealth.

MYRE: Well, they do spend a lot. And [**they\'ve really ramped up their

Wow. MYRE: And last year, [we\'ve seen reports they bought \$3.4 billion
of weapons from the U.S]{.underline}., far more than any other country.
So as a general principle, the Saudis are the biggest weapons buyer from
the United States - not on the scale that the president has suggested.
KELLY: OK. So that **[110 billion]{.underline}** may be aspirational, a
kind of wish list. But [what kind of weapons]{.underline} have they

#### Saudi's shift towards the east [overwhelms]{.underline} interoperability 

**Clifford 19** -- Public Affairs and Policy Executive. (Richard, "Saudi
Arabia and its Eastward Shift" Human Security Centre, March 15, 2019,
<http://www.hscentre.org/uncategorized/saudi-arabia-and-its-eastward-shift)//RP>

Widely derided in the west for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and for
allegations of human rights abuses in Yemen, [M]{.underline}ohammed
[B]{.underline}in [S]{.underline}alman['s focus recently shifted
eastward.]{.underline} Two weeks ago, [the Crown Prince concluded his
whistle stop tour of India, Pakistan and China]{.underline}, arriving at
each with memoranda for large investments, **[pledges for greater
cooperation]{.underline}** and a clear desire to avoid controversy or
issues of contention. For Saudi Arabia, Asia and its growing markets
were always going to be an essential component of its grand Vision 2030
plan, aiming to transform Saudi Arabia's oil-dependent economy into one
better suited to the economic realities of the 21st century. But given
the Crown Princes status as a pariah in the west, this visit felt more
significant. This is exactly what Riyadh was hoping for. As previously
seen with his enthusiastic greeting with Vladimir Putin in Buenos Aries
at the G20 summit, MBS aims to brazenly rehabilitate his own image on
the international stage and more importantly, [demonstrate Saudi
Arabia's intention to create a strategic counterweight to its ties with
western partners. For Saudi]{.underline} Arabia, [diversifying its
relationships has been a long-term aim and as such, **the ground is
already largely set for an eastward pivot.**]{.underline} Saudi Arabia
and Pakistan for example, regard one another as indispensable allies.
Both are overwhelmingly Sunni states and Pakistani leaders and citizens
respect the Saudi King as the custodian of Mecca and Medina, the two
holiest sites in Islam. Economically, Pakistan is heavily reliant on
Saudi Arabia as a trading partner and as its key provider of oil. China,
meanwhile, is already Saudi Arabia's top export destination with \$42
billion in bilateral trade in 2017. [Bolstering these economic ties in
Asia was a key aim of the recent visit]{.underline}. Over the course of
the week a slew of deals and Memorandum's of Understanding (MOU's) were
signed, promising billions of dollars in investment. In India, MBS
claimed that he saw investment opportunities worth \$100 billion in
various sectors, signing MOU's on areas such as tourism, cultural
exchanges, and in a pointed reference to Iran and the sanctions regime
it's petrochemical sector faces, promised to ensure that Saudi Arabia
would help India meet any shortfall in supply. In China, Asia's emerging
superpower, the Crown Prince held talks with President Xi Jinping
signing a \$10bn deal to develop a refining and petrochemical complex in
northeastern Liaoning province, and in Pakistan, MBS signed deals
including a \$10 billion agreement on establishing an oil refinery in
the southwestern coastal city of Gwadar and a \$4 billion agreement on
developing alternative energy sources. Despite the obdurate reluctance
of US and UK Governments to criticise Saudi Arabia[, in the west,
scrutiny of the kingdom's actions is greater than at any point since
9/11.]{.underline} In February this year, appalled at the civilian
suffering in Yemen caused by the Saudi bombing campaign, the US House of
Representatives approved a resolution that would force the Trump
administration to withdraw US troops and support from the Saudi campaign
in Yemen. With the front runner for the Democratic Party's nomination,
Bernie Sanders, leading calls in the Senate to end US arms sales to
Saudi Arabia, and with other nominees likely to adopt a similar
position, this will accelerate Riyadh's desire to hedge its bets.
Strategically for Saudi Arabia there is merit in pursuing allies whose
populations and political parties are less inclined to be critical. In
China and Pakistan particularly, it is unlikely that MBS will be
properly scrutinised for his foreign policy actions. India, a staunch
defender of human rights historically, could have been a different
story. However, at Government level at least, the reception that MBS
received suggests that India's concern is not primarily on Khashoggi or
Yemen. [Saudi]{.underline} Arabia [is one of the largest arms importers
in the world with an **increasing appetite for weaponry**]{.underline}.
Its defence budget has increased from \$27.1 billion (2010) to \$56
billion (2018), with most of their imports coming from western sources.
[With public and political pressure growing in its main arms supplier,
Saudi Arabia is now looking to upgrade its own capacity to build weapons
and to diversify its supply chains.]{.underline} [In 2017 Saudi Arabia
signed a \$3bn arms deal with Russia, and Asian markets will be eager
for similar investments. China has looked to position itself as a
potential 'Plan B' for Middle Eastern states looking for weapons and has
already made some inroads into the Saudi market through selling armed
drones.]{.underline} However, it currently lacks the capacity to fill
any serious gap left by the Saudis' western partners. In any case, given
the huge amounts of money invested in western technologies, it would be
difficult to replace these with weapons from a new supplier. To do so
would require a huge restructuring effort of the armed forces and would
cause huge logistical issues. This means that any attempt from Saudi
Arabia to move its arms supply away from the west voluntarily will be
difficult. So long as the west are willing to sell arms to Saudi Arabia
there is likely to be a market there.

[**Russia's growing influence is manifest across the region**, from
Morocco to Iran]{.underline}. This remarkable turnabout, part of
Vladimir Putin's overarching strategy of restoring Russia's standing as
a great power, has been the result of deft diplomacy combined with a
willingness to sell arms and nuclear power reactors to all askers. While
international attention has been focused on the Iranian nuclear program,
[Russia has been playing an increasingly important role]{.underline} in
two other dangerous trends underway [in the region: a massive
conventional arms race]{.underline}---\$1.3 trillion of arms bought by
the Gulf states alone between 2000 and 2014---[and a dramatic push to
procure nuclear power reactors]{.underline}. All of the reactor programs
reflect legitimate energy needs, but "civil" nuclear programs in the
Middle East have a nasty tendency to morph into military ones. U.S.
allies in the region today have become hesitant to continue placing all
of their strategic faith and security in American hands. While they
uniformly welcome President Trump's more hardline approach, the scars of
American weakness during the Obama years, as they perceive it, have yet
to heal. Moreover, Trump's unique character has engendered ongoing
doubts regarding American trustworthiness. For the meantime, U.S. allies
are hedging their bets. [**Egypt's anger over** what it viewed as
**insufficient American support** for the Mubarak regime, and subsequent
sanctions on arms sales, **led to a significant improvement in its
relations with Russia.**]{.underline} A deal for four Russian nuclear
power reactors was concluded in 2017. Military ties have been restored,
including the sale of some dozens of advanced fighters, attack
helicopters and S-300 missiles, along with new joint military exercises.
Egypt has been the linchpin of American policy in the region ever since
it evicted the Soviets in the early 1970s. In so doing, it created the
basis for the three mutually reinforcing pillars of U.S. Middle East
policy to this day: the establishment of a moderate, pro-American Arab
camp with Egypt and Saudi Arabia at its center; countering regional
rogues such as Iraq, Iran and Libya with the moderates' support; and the
promotion of Arab-Israeli peace---again, with moderate support[. An
Egyptian-Russian rapprochement constitutes a severe blow to American
standing.]{.underline} For decades, an unwritten deal has governed
U.S.-Saudi relations; security for an assured supply of oil. In 1991,
the United States even went to war in defense of Saudi Arabia. Today,
however, the Saudis are skittish. In 2017, King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al
Saud conducted the first ever visit of a Saudi monarch to Russia. A deal
was signed for highly advanced S-400 and anti-tank missiles. A nuclear
cooperation agreement was also signed, and Russia hopes to provide at
least two of the planned sixteen Saudi reactors. Russia and Saudi
Arabia---who together make up approximately 20 percent of international
oil production---have also coordinated policy to raise the global price.
[Russia's minimalistic military intervention in Syria, with just two
fighter squadrons, has been remarkably successful, saving the Assad
regime at virtually no cost to Russia]{.underline}, which left the
bloody ground fighting to Iran and Hezbollah. Obama's self-enervating
prognosis that Syria would become Russia's Vietnam has been proven
baseless. **[Russia has become the primary player in Syria
today]{.underline}**, [ensuring its long-term presence there with a
Syrian commitment to grant it air and naval bases]{.underline}---from
which it projects region-wide power---[for forty-nine more
years]{.underline}. A country of little importance in and of itself to
the United States, [Syria has become the focal point of the most
critical regional issues, including the Sunni-Shiite confrontation, the
war against ISIS, Iranian expansionism, and a possible Iranian-Israeli
conflict]{.underline}. **[Russia's position in Syria provides it with

Involved in armed conflicts on two fronts, in eastern Ukraine and Syria,
the Russian Federation's dual campaigns are often closely associated
with one another. Experts looking at Russia's ongoing operations in the
Syrian Civil War often attempt to link them to the conflict in Ukraine.
In doing so, analysts and policymakers may inadvertently fail to see the
full range of consequences [the renewed Russian presence in the Middle
East brings]{.underline}. This in no way implies a lack of relationship
between the two, but rather that the economic and political benefits
Moscow is reaping should be appreciated before such a causal
relationship can be understood. Two main factors of Russia's
intervention in Syria will affect future calculi between interlocutors
attempting to resolve the war in the Donbas region and the illegal
annexation of Crimea. The first factor that needs addressing is the
near-term consequences. [Because of its military cooperation with Bashar
al-Assad's regime and other regional players, **Moscow has managed to
secure billions of dollars from states in the Middle East** such as
Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.]{.underline} Along with
rising global oil prices, Russia has further insulated itself against
Western sanctions. The second implication is the geopolitical importance
of [Russia's growing presence in the region]{.underline}, which it is
utilizing [to cast influence throughout the Middle East and North
Africa]{.underline} (MENA). Its significance comes in the shape of a
favorable bargaining position within and without the Minsk framework
(for the resolution of the conflict in eastern Ukraine) for two reasons:
geoeconomic clout vis-à-vis the energy market and political leverage
over the European Union as it attempts to manage issues related to
immigration flows from the MENA region. Inextricably Linked [September
30, 2015, marked **the beginning of Russia's official involvement in
Syria** at the request of President Assad, opening with airstrikes
around the cities of Homs and Hama in western Syria against the
mainstream opposition force]{.underline}s. With the war in eastern
Ukraine already being waged for over a year at that point, the two
conflicts have since been inextricably linked. Some analysts posit that
Russia's incursion into Syria serves the same purpose as prior
aggressions in Ukraine, namely dismantling the current Western-led world
order that has been in place since World War II. Concerning this link,
Russia's President Vladimir Putin likely knew he would be able to use
any gains in the Middle East in his favor concerning Ukraine. However,
these [gains]{.underline}, when seen through a wider lens than just the
regional context of Ukraine, [provide a clearer analysis of the
economically and geopolitically revitalized bargaining position given to
the Kremlin on issues with transatlantic partners writ
large]{.underline} and, therefore, certainly concerning Donbas and
Crimea. Throughout 2014, as US and EU sanctions began to accumulate, the
ruble was at one point devalued by roughly 50%. While Moscow has
reclaimed some economic stability, the strength of the Russian currency,
which is currently priced at 65 against the US dollar, is no where near
its former status of around 35 rubles against the dollar. While
sanctions have certainly hurt Russia's economy, the drop in the global
oil prices had a much more significant effect. Russia's long-term budget
projections placed oil above \$100 per barrel; however, at certain
points in 2016, the price fell below \$30. Moscow's economic
difficulties were further compounded by the budgetary pressures
self-imposed by its activities in Ukraine, as well as the economic shock
experienced during the 2008-09 global financial crisis that drained
central reserves. Even if the sanctions were never imposed, some suggest
the Kremlin would still have found itself in a difficult position.
Irrespective of sanctions staying in place, last year the State Duma
reviewed the federal budget and projected a surplus of 0.5% of GDP,
equating to around \$7.7 billion. This was the first expected surplus
since 2011, which displays the preponderant effect of oil over Western
sanctions given that 2012 marked the beginning of a drop in global oil
prices. The World Bank confirmed such reports, forecasting 1.5% GDP
growth in 2018, followed by an increase of 1.8% from 2019-20. Entering
Syria Although the financial losses due to sanctions have not had the
same effect as declining oil prices, they have certainly taken their
toll. Resumed business with the EU and the US would be the best-case
scenario for Russia. However, this would only begin to be a possibility
after the Kremlin put forth a concerted effort to work with the
international community to bring about peace in the region. Moscow,
however, understands that an abrupt end to the fighting in Donbas, in
which it has only marginally admitted involvement, would be highly
unlikely, especially while trying to save face on both the international
stage as well as in front of domestic audiences. Given this reality,
Russia appears fully committed to increasing relations in the Middle
East not only militarily, but also economically, as part of its eastward
pivot toward the MENA region and Asia. Important to note is that on the
list of sanctioned individuals and entities is Vnesheconombank (VEB), of
which Russia's sovereign wealth fund (SWF), the Russian Direct
Investment Fund (RDIF), is a fully owned subsidiary. Put simply, SWFs
serve as state-owned instruments in public finance. Largely funded by
revenues from commodity exports or from foreign exchange reserves in a
state's central bank, SWFs may be used to invest globally. As such,
[**Russia has begun to circumvent the economic hardship of sanctions**
and severed business partnerships in the West by contractually binding
itself to other sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East.]{.underline}

[Russia\'s **growing prominence in the Middle East** was on full display
Dec. 11 when Vladimir Putin visited three key Middle Eastern countries
in one day]{.underline}. The Russian president followed a surprise trip
to Syria with a quick stop in Egypt before ending his day\'s travels in
Turkey. He met with his presidential counterparts in all three
countries, and the economic deals, military agreements and political
settlements he discussed highlighted Russia\'s role in the region. While
[Russia has its own reasons for **bolstering its relationships with
Syria, Egypt and Turkey,**]{.underline} it also benefits from being
visible where its regional rival, the United States, is not. Russia\'s
diplomatic reach in the Middle East varies significantly per country.
Its fair-weather relationship with strategic powers such as Iran goes
back centuries, while its pursuit of a strong relationship with Saudi
Arabia is developing, for example. Russia\'s relationship with Turkey
has yielded friction and fruit over the decades, depending on which way
the pendulum has swung. But what is striking about Russian diplomacy
over the past couple of years is how [**Moscow\'s diplomatic presence
has saturated the region.** Its activity in such areas as the
Palestinian territories, Libya, Israel, Lebanon, Qatar, the United Arab
Emirates and Saudi Arabia is in some ways reminiscent of the Soviet
Union\'s broad presence across the region]{.underline}. The
juxtaposition with a United States that seems to want to draw down its
regional commitments and focus on other issues, such as turning at long
last to Asia instead of attending to fires in the Middle East, is
noticeable, and it is heightened by Russia\'s appearing to be everywhere

#### Alt causes to Al Shabaab expansion

**Hashi 18** (Abdirashid Hashi Executive Director Heritage Institute for
Policy Studies (HIPS), "Fixing the Failed State of Somalia: Challenges
and Opportunities,"
<https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/031418_Hashi_Testimony.pdf>)SEM

The second [reason why Somalia is hovering between being a 'failed
state' and its current designation as a 'fragile state' is the
conspicuous **absence of the essential resources** needed to put the
country back on its feet]{.underline}. For starters, let's consider the
national budget of the federal government: about US\$270 million a year,
over 99 percent of which is spent paying salaries of civil servants and
security personnel. At a minimum, the government would need roughly
US\$3 billion a year to implement its own National Development Plan.
[With such meager resources, the government can't deliver rudimentary
services, **let alone defeat Al Shabaab** or win the hearts and minds of
Somalia's massive unemployed youth population]{.underline}, which is
estimated to be 70 percent of the estimated 12 million citizens. Landing
a man on Mars with equipment sourced from a Dollar Store is more
realistic than expecting Somalia to have a functioning state with its
current resources, financial or otherwise. [The government]{.underline}
is trying to expand its revenue base, but it will take years to
realistically levy taxes on all of its 18 administrative regions. It
[only controls the capital Mogadishu, and the rest is in the hands of
federal member states (and Somaliland]{.underline} which considers
itself as a separate state). The regions jealously guard their sources
of revenue such as ports and airports. Somaliland has just transferred
70 percent of the Port of Berbera to UAE's Dubai World port management
company and the government of Ethiopia -- against the objections of the
Somali government. On 12 March 2018, parliament banned Dubai World from
Somalia and labeled that deal as null and void and a blatant breach on
Somalia's sovereignty. [This could further complicate the already frozen
Somalia-Somaliland talks on unity/secession issues and may also put the
fledgling Somali government and the UAE on a collision
course]{.underline}. Thirdly, [**genuine political inclusivity remains
elusive**. A winner takes all mentality reigns throughout]{.underline}
the country, [creating deep political instability]{.underline}. In a
country where political and social reconciliation remain a work in
progress, **[Somalia's elite has failed to rise to the occasion and
unite against]{.underline}** the common enemy---[**Al-Shabaab. Instead,
they routinely spend much needed resources and energy on political
infighting**. They have also failed to capitalize on
elections]{.underline} which bring fresh opportunities to create an
environment conducive to stability in the form of inclusive political
dispensation. Regrettably, each new [leadership makes the exact same
mistakes and spends the next four years fending off political rivals,
instead of facing off against Al-Shabaab]{.underline}. The fourth
[reason]{.underline} why Somalia's recovery is slow -- and often goes
dangerously into reverse -- [is the meddling of external actors with
both benevolent and malevolent intentions]{.underline}. Interference by
others has ceaselessly muddied Somalia's already troubled waters. The
negative energies emanating from both state and non-state actors can be
as damaging as the mischief and mediocrity of Somali politicians and the
mayhem of Al Shabaab. For instance, during elections, money from
overseas and local powerbrokers is used to unseat some politicians and
install others. All candidates openly dole out cash to win elections.
Meanwhile, [the Gulf crisis is playing out dangerously in Somalia. If
the negative impact of the dispute between UAE and Qatar is not checked,
it could easily destroy all the gains made thus far and will
**eventually strengthen Al Shabaab's hand**]{.underline}. Petrodollars
should be used to avert starvation in Somalia -- not to put this
fledgling country in the middle of a geopolitical power play. It is
because of these profound challenges that it is possible to argue in one
sentence -- however contradictory or confusing it may sound -- that that
the situation in Somalia is paradoxically good, bad and ugly all at the
same time.

territorial sea to suppress piracy.]{.underline} Such authorisation is
given when the use of force is justified to protect international peace
and security. [More resolutions have since followed. The result was an
inter-State, inter-agency and public-private response involving a number
of players]{.underline}. These included states, the shipping industry
and other stakeholders like the United Nations and the International
Maritime Organisation. These actors formed the Contact Group on Piracy
off the Coast of Somalia. This, in turn, was split into working groups
whose members implemented and coordinated the counter measures. [The
all-encompassing response came together as follows: International navies
would escort vessels through the High Risk Area and shipping vessels
would employ shipping self-protection measures, such as hiring armed
guards. Both navies and armed guards would then respond to attacks and
apprehend suspects.]{.underline} Law reforms in regional countries
ensured that piracy was an offence in domestic legislation. This allowed
suspects to be handed over to regional states for prosecution. This was
facilitated by a regional pirate prosecution model and capacity building
projects. [These ensured that regional courts were enabled to try
pirates and criminal justice practitioners were trained to prosecute
piracy]{.underline}. Regional prisons, including in Somalia, were then
built or improved to house convicted pirates. In addition, [capacity
building projects focused on building the capacity of regional maritime
law enforcement entities]{.underline}. There were also land based
development programmes aimed at the causes of piracy. These included
counter-piracy messaging and alternative livelihood programmes. **[Many
of these measures are still in place today,]{.underline}** although many
have taken on a different form.

The key question is: **[when the war in Yemen will wind down, will the

[Given the development of holistic relations, also beyond security
dynamics]{.underline}, **[it is unlikely this would precipitate a major

catalyst for deeper partnerships, with the Gulf now viewing eastern
Africa as a crucial backyard region]{.underline}. In such a rapidly

more secure and stable partnership for all involved.

change course of battle in Yemen: analysts" Xinhua, July 21, 2019,

DEN, Yemen, July 13 (Xinhua) \-- [After years of deadly conflict that
ravaged Yemen and caused worsening humanitarian situation, **the Houthi
rebels unveiled new types of \"locally-made ballistic missiles and armed
drones.\"**]{.underline} Pro-Houthi politicians and members of the
rebels\' ruling council inaugurated [a military exhibition that
contained allegedly new developed drones and missiles to be used against
the Saudi Arabia-led coalition]{.underline} supporting Yemen\'s
internationally recognized government. The rebels claimed that their
[developed weapons \"would **change the course of the battle** through
reaching the depths of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
and targeting vital locations there.\"]{.underline} However, Yemeni
analysts voiced a different view regarding the growing military
capabilities of the Houthi rebels who stepped up their missile attacks
against a number of airports in Saudi Arabia recently. Fares Albeel, a
college professor and political commentator, said the upgraded Houthi
weapons, including the unmanned aircraft and ballistic missiles, may
pose a danger, but won\'t leave a destructive effect or change the
course of the battle in Yemen. \"The Houthis are not capable of
confronting the Saudi-led coalition through Iran\'s military technology
and strategy that are clearly present in their recent drone attacks and
military operations,\" Fares said. \"The rebels mainly depend on weapons
and tools that don\'t belong to the conventional military system,\" he
explained. \"Like other armed factions linked to Iran in the region, the
Houthi weapons such as the drones are capable of creating chaos and
destabilizing security but cannot leave destruction or defeat other
military powers,\" he concluded. [The Houthis unveiled new military
hardware even as the UAE, a key partner of the Saudi-led coalition,
announced a strategic and tactical redeployment of troops in
Yemen.]{.underline} Following the UAE\'s military plan, different Yemeni
armed factions stationed in the country\'s Red Sea coast areas started
forming a unified military leadership that will guide the anti-Houthi
forces in an upcoming military operation. An official of the
pro-government forces based in Hodeidah confirmed to Xinhua that more
than 25,000 troops deployed by the UAE are still in Hodeidah. He said
[**the UAE still has a significant role** in leading the pro-government
forces in Hodeidah and has participated in the formation of a joint
command for all anti-Houthi forces in recent days.]{.underline} Adil
Al-Shujaa, a politics professor from Sanaa University, supported the
formation of the joint military command of the pro-government forces.
\"Leaving the responsibility for the Yemenis themselves is a good thing
because the Saudi-led coalition is the only one leading the battle,\"
Adel said. \"The Yemeni soldiers only have light weapons and handing
over the air power for this unified Yemeni military leadership will lead
to a decisive operation in Hodeidah\'s battle,\" he explained. In
response, the Houthi rebels beefed up their military presence in the Red
Sea port city. Sources from both warring sides confirmed that [there is
an intention to end the Stockholm Agreement and **escalate the situation
militarily** as each side started preparing for new armed confrontations
on Hodeidah\'s ground]{.underline}. Yahya Abu Hatim, a strategic
military expert, said the unified pro-government Yemeni forces in
Hodeidah will be able to proceed the anti-Houthi military operations
with more success in the upcoming period. \"Kicking the rebels out from
the strategic city of Hodeidah and approaching from the capital Sanaa
will force the Houthi militia to accept the political solutions and end
the country\'s conflict,\" Hatim said. [**The U**nited **N**ations
**sponsored a series of negotiations** between the Saudi-backed Yemeni
government and the Iranian-allied Houthi rebels **but failed to achieve
permanent peace** in the impoverished Arab country.]{.underline} \"There
is a frightening absence of the political situation in Yemen as the
country\'s crisis became part of the regional conflict \... **[It\'s
difficult to predict quick solutions to Yemen\'s complicated
issue]{.underline}**,\" said Fares. During the past days, [the Houthi
rebels turned to launching attacks using numerous explosives-laden
drones against vital institutions deep inside Saudi Arabia amid
**heightened tension between Iran and Saudi** Arabia]{.underline} backed
by the United States. The Iran-allied Houthis launched a large military
campaign and seized the capital Sanaa in late 2014, forcing Yemen\'s
President Abdu-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and his government to escape to Aden
first and then neighboring Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia. along with other
Arab countries, intervened militarily and began pounding the
Houthi-controlled capital Sanaa in March 2015 in response to an official
public request from Hadi to protect Yemen. Currently, some 24 million
Yemenis, or 80 percent of the entire population, need humanitarian aid
and protection, with some 20 million requiring help to secure food, the
United Nations said.

US over sanctions and the 2015 nuclear agreement, and Tehran's seizure
of two British-linked vessels in the strait of Hormuz on
Friday.]{.underline} Saudi Arabia's defence ministry confirmed the
deployment. "Based on mutual cooperation between Saudi Arabia and the
United States of America, and their desire to enhance everything that
could preserve the security of the region and its stability \... King
Salman gave his approval to host American forces," a ministry spokesman
was quoted by Saudi state news agency SPA as saying. In June, **[the

of the war with Iraq. [The US presence in Saudi Arabia lasted 12 years,

Kuwait.]{.underline} As many as 200 US aircraft were stationed at the
Prince Sultan air base, around 80 km (50 miles) south of the capital at
the peak of the Iraq war, and as many as 2,700 missions a day were
handled by the headquarters in Saudi Arabia. But relations between the
two countries were not always easy during the 12 years of cooperation,
particularly following the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York which
were orchestrated by Saudi-born al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.

Stena Impero into port after Iranian officials said it had infringed
maritime regulations. The ship's owners said the vessel had been
"approached by unidentified small crafts and a helicopter during transit
of the strait of Hormuz while the vessel was in international waters". A
second tanker, the Mesdar, which is Liberian-flagged but British
operated, also made a sudden diversion from its course towards the Saudi
port of Ras Tanura on Friday, and tracking data showed it moving
northwards towards the Iranian coast before apparently turning off its
tracking signal. Iran's semi-official news agency, Fars, reported the
ship was briefly detained in the strait of Hormuz and given a notice to
comply with environmental regulations before being allowed to continue
on its way. The [incidents in the strait of Hormuz came as US President

that was threatening a US naval vessel, despite denials from
Tehran.]{.underline}

Yemen"
<https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/saudi-arabia-forced-to-fight-its-own-war-in-yemen)mba-alb>

With the United Arab Emirates (UAE) adjusting its cost-benefit calculus
in Yemen, resulting in a serious disengagement there, [Saudi Arabia will
have to shoulder more of the direct burden to continue its]{.underline}
[war]{.underline}. While the UAE has not completely withdrawn from
Yemen, it has 'repositioned' forces and withdrawn from several bases in
key port cities. **[Riyadh]{.underline}** [**has had to move some of its
troops into the military bases in the** ports of al-Mokha and
al-Khokha]{.underline}. These bases are near the strategically important
port of Hodeidah. **[Additional Saudi forces moved into Aden as
well]{.underline}**. These moves show that Riyadh will need its own
boots on the ground, as well as planes in the air, if it wants to
continue the disastrous quagmire it started in Yemen in 2015. UAE
officials insist that the withdrawal of its own forces will not tip the
balance of the conflict, as it is leaving behind an estimated 90,000
Yemeni forces it trained and equipped over the last several years. While
[it is unlikely that Houthi rebels can claim territorial conquests as a
result of the UAE leaving]{.underline} the conflict, it is also true
that even at its fullest strength, the Saudi/UAE combined force was
unable to achieve its stated goal of defeating the Houthis. **[Claiming
victory over the Houthis remains a top priority for Saudi Arabia, as the
rebels present a very real threat along their southern
border.]{.underline}** The Houthis have repeatedly targeted and
frequently hit Saudi civilian airports and other infrastructure. This
threat has actually increased since the beginning of the war,
ironically. In fact, all of the threats Riyadh declared as justification
for the war have actually increased. Indeed, **[Iran's influence and
malign actions in Yemen are now greater---and the Houthis are more of a
military threat to southern Saudi Arabia---than when the war
started]{.underline}**. With Riyadh losing its most significant
direct-action partner, the UAE, the number of troops Saudi will move
into the fight is a looming question. There is not likely to be a
serious public rift between the UAE and Saudi Arabia; the two still
share a common vision of a Gulf region in which they and not Iran are
the paramount powers. Yet Abu Dhabi appears to have made the decision,
at least in the case of Yemen, that the singular focus on viewing every
issue as a winner-take-all contest with Tehran is damaging the UAE's
pubic image in the West, and actually counterproductive in terms of
reducing Iranian influence. For the UAE, there is no geopolitical upside
to continuing its role in the Yemen war. Saudi Arabia, on the other
hand, has boxed itself into a corner, leaving it no easy out in Yemen.
It's reputation in the West does not seem to be a matter of concern;
Riyadh has shown that it will ignore international condemnation in the
case of Yemen. [The UAE withdrawal might bring about an increase in
Saudi airstrikes]{.underline} to make up in the air what is being lost
on the ground, which would increase the devastation to the country and
the Yemeni people.

[This does not mean that the UAE is ending its involvement in Yemen

receded]{.underline} entirely. **[The Emirates]{.underline}**, as noted,
**[remain heavily committed in the south]{.underline}**. [While it has

Yemen, the most likely entails a deteriorating status quo: continued
stagnation in implementing the Stockholm Agreement, extension of the war
inside and outside of Yemen, damaged UN credibility and effectiveness,
and deepening Huthi dependence on Iran. Already, fighting has
intensified in various areas of the country, such as al-Dhale in the
south, and Hajja on the northern border, drawing some front-line forces
away from Hodeida. This trend could well persist, worsening the
situation for Yemen's civilian population. Even in Hodeida itself there
is reason for worry. Should the fragile ceasefire around Hodeida
continue to erode, it could precipitate a low-intensity struggle for the
city. Since the UAE's plans to draw down its own presence on the Red Sea
coast, reports have emerged that [Saudi Arabia plans to fill the vacuum

Hodeida,]{.underline} perhaps encouraged by Saudi Arabia in the wake of

the war in western Yemen?"
<https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/emirati-pullout-new-chapter-war-western-yemen>)
mba-alb

On 8 July, the United Arab Emirates announced that it was winding down
its military involvement in Yemen as it pledged to reduce the number of
troops it had deployed in the war-torn country. The UAE has been
involved militarily in Yemen since 2015 as a member of the Saudi-led
coalition fighting against Houthi rebels and backing exiled Yemeni
President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi. The recent announcement came as a
spokesperson in Abu Dhabi told reporters that the country was shifting
from a \"military-first strategy\" to a \"peace-first strategy\" in
Yemen. But Yemenis who spoke to Middle East Eye seemed to believe the
move may have been more motivated by a lack of civilian support and
power struggles between militias that could further degenerate now that
the UAE is on its way out. Passing the baton [After the Saudi-led
coalition took the areas of Mocha, Khokha and others on the western
coast in early 2017, the UAE became the de facto ruling power in the
region, spanning between the Hodeidah and Taiz provinces]{.underline}.
[The Emirates trained Yemeni forces]{.underline} in the western coast
under the name of al-Amaliqa, as well as fighters loyal to Tareq Saleh,
the nephew of former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh. Both groups
joined forces in western Yemen under the name \"Guards of the Republic\"
and stood with the UAE**[. The recent Emirati decision to scale down its
presence on the western coast is tied to the increased role of these
friendly Yemeni forces]{.underline}**. "The leadership of the Emirati
forces in Yemen decided to reduce the number of Emirati fighters on the
western coast and they vacated a camp in Khokha, but [that does not mean
they have withdrawn from the battle,"]{.underline} a source in the
Amaliqa forces in Mocha confirmed to MEE. "**[Emirati forces trained
Yemeni forces and we are fighting on the ground under the supervision of
Emirati officers on the western coast and in Aden."]{.underline}** The
source said he believed the UAE should have scaled down its presence in
western Yemen at least a year ago, arguing that pro-Hadi Yemeni forces
were adequately trained and equipped to fight and defend the western
coast from the Houthis. "It is irrational that Emirati soldiers fight on
the frontlines while Yemenis do not. [We can defend our land and we only
need some instruction and suggestions from Emirati military
experts]{.underline}," he added. "[The Houthis tried to attack us, but
we could handle all attacks alone without help from Emirati
forces]{.underline}," the Amaliqa source said. "The recent attacks by
the Houthis confirmed that \[pro-Hadi\] [Yemeni forces are qualified
enough to lead the battles alone against the Houthis]{.underline}."
Meanwhile, **[Saudi and Sudanese forces remain present on the western
coast and have also been involved in fierce ongoing battles in the area
since Emirati troops first started to withdraw -]{.underline}** although
the Amaliqa source said they were mainly overseeing Yemeni fighters and
not involved in direct battles. Long-distance control [While Emirati
soldiers may be leaving the western coast, Yemeni residents believe that
the small Gulf country remains the main power in control of the
area]{.underline}. "[We cannot see Emirati fighters in the streets, but
we can see their flags on public institutio]{.underline}ns and every day
we face Yemeni forces on the ground who are worse than the Emiratis,"
Ali, a resident of Mocha, told MEE. "Emirati forces think we will
believe that Yemenis have taken control of the western coast," Ali
added**[. "But all of us know that Emirati forces withdrew after placing
their hands \[pro-Hadi Yemeni forces\] along the western
coast]{.underline}**." Many residents of the area have little love for
the UAE, especially after Emirati forces barred fishermen from sailing
or fishing off the coast earlier this year. "The Emirates are looting
our wealth while our children starve to death," Ali said. "[Emiratis
still control the western coast and most of the southern provinces from
a distance]{.underline}, and no one can oppose it." While in Abu Dhabi
authorities spoke of a shift to a \"peace-first strategy\", Yemeni
civilians said they did not feel any peace in the western coast with
battles still raging on. Salem Abu al-Leil, a resident of Hodeidah
province, said fighting had not lessened in Hodeidah and that he foresaw
no progress towards peace in the province. "We heard that Emirati forces
withdrew from Hodeidah, but\...the only development is that Yemenis are
now fighting each other so the Emirates will not lose more fighters,"
Abu al-Leil told MEE. "I do not believe **[this is]{.underline}** a step
towards peace, but it can be **[a new war strategy by the Saudi-led
coalition]{.underline}**." For Abu al-Leil, the UAE's lack of popular
support among residents of Hodeidah and surrounding areas was a factor
that led the country to believe the best course of action would be to
replace its forces with Yemeni groups more likely to be accepted by
locals. Coalition struggles Ziyad al-Sharif, a pro-UAE fighter in Aden,
told MEE he saw the Emirati move as a first step towards peace, with
more steps to follow in the coming months - before accusing the Islah
movement affiliated to the Muslim Brotherhood of being behind criticisms
of the UAE, despite also being on the side of President Hadi. "Islahis
and their supporters criticise the Emirates for any development, even if
it is a positive one," Sharif said. "The [UAE is reducing troops in
Yemen to allow Yemenis to lead the battles and there is nothing wrong
with that]{.underline}." He slammed Islah critiques as undermining the
pro-Hadi coalition and ultimately benefiting Houthi rebels. "The Islah
party and Houthis stand on the same side to criticise and fight
legitimacy \[Hadi\], which the UAE came to support," Sharif added. "The
UAE came to help Yemenis and not to kill us, but Islahis do not believe
this." Meanwhile, seasoned Taiz-based journalist Mohammed Ali told MEE
that the UAE withdrawal could be tied to growing tensions between
southern separatist forces and Tareq Saleh's fighters in the west.
"Southern forces backed by the UAE used to be the main power on the
western coast, but President Hadi sent Tareq's forces last year to the
same areas," Ali told MEE. "Southern forces did not welcome Tareq's
forces and vice versa. While both support the UAE, it was difficult for
the UAE to remain on the western coast."

[Rising unpopularity of UAE's military presence in southern Yemen
explains shift towards more indirect power projection]{.underline} On
July 9, the United Arab Emirates ([UAE) withdrew its military forces
from Yemen's port city of Hudaydah, in order to transition from a
\"military-first strategy to a peace-first strategy]{.underline}.\"
Emirati officials justified this redeployment by claiming that UAE
forces needed to focus on confronting Iran and highlighting Abu Dhabi's
success in marginalizing the Houthis as a major political force in
southern Yemen. Although these factors contributed to the UAE's policy
shift in Yemen, the UAE's decision to scale back its military
intervention in Yemen was also triggered by international pressure and a
desire to suspend a protracted military campaign. In spite of U.S.
President Donald Trump's close relationship with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Zayed, the U.S. Department of Defense recently pressured
the UAE to allow an investigation into the abuse of detainees in Yemen.
Backlash against the UAE's alleged arms shipments to al-Qaeda in Yemen
and criticisms of the UAE's role in worsening Yemen's humanitarian
crisis have also damaged the UAE's international reputation. As the
UAE's geopolitical vision depends on blending hard and soft power, Abu
Dhabi's withdrawal announcement was aimed, in part, at salvaging the
UAE's tarnished reputation. As the Yemeni civil war drags on, UAE
officials have also faced internal pressure to demonstrate that their
involvement in Yemen is finite. Reservations about the sustainability of
the UAE's military intervention first surfaced in official circles
during the early stages of the conflict. In July 2016, UAE Minister of
State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash announced the Yemen war was
\"over for our troops,\" and Mohammed bin Zayed concurred with Gargash's
statement on Twitter. Although these comments did not change the UAE's
conduct in Yemen, they suggest that Abu Dhabi would be willing to
unilaterally withdraw from Yemen, if the timing was suitable. The
UAE-aligned Southern Transitional Council (STC)'s hegemony over Aden has
allowed Emirati officials to claim that their withdrawal is about
consolidating gains, rather than an admission of defeat. This narrative
frame has helped Mohammed bin Zayed smoothly navigate the UAE's drawdown
from Yemen. [Even though the UAE is downsizing its military presence,
Abu Dhabi does not wish to surrender its influence in
Yemen]{.underline}. **[To preserve its favorable strategic position, the
UAE will selectively engage in counter-terrorism operations in Yemen,
assist its proxies in their efforts to consolidate hegemony over
southern Yemen, and expand its diplomatic involvement in
Yemen]{.underline}**. [These actions will help ensure that UAE-Saudi
Arabia relations are not severely damaged by Abu Dhabi's unilateral
withdrawal and that the UAE will secure its interests in an eventual
Yemeni peace settlement]{.underline}. In [spite of the UAE's troop
drawdown from Yemen, initial reports suggest that Abu Dhabi will
maintain a military presence in its]{.underline} base on al-Mukalla, a
former al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) stronghold that was
overrun by the UAE in 2016. The UAE will keep this deployment because it
fears that AQAP could gain supporters by claiming that the UAE is
plundering southern Yemen's resources and instigating south Yemeni
separatism. UAE officials are also concerned that their south Yemeni
separatist proxies lack preparation for a counter-terrorism campaign
against the AQAP, as they have traditionally relied on support from the
UAE armed forces. In addition to ensuring that al-Mukalla does not fall
into AQAP hands, [the UAE's continued participation in counter-terrorism
campaigns strengthens its partnerships with Saudi Arabia and the
U.S]{.underline}. Although the UAE insists that it consulted with Saudi
Arabia before announcing a drawdown from Yemen, Abu Dhabi's hostile
relationship with Saudi-aligned President of Yemen Abd Rabbuh Mansur
Hadi and support for the STC rankle Saudi policymakers. By engaging in
counter-terrorism missions against what it describes as a
Houthi-ISIS-AQAP coalition, the UAE preserves its high level of military
cooperation with Saudi Arabia. The UAE also wants to highlight its value
as a counter-terrorism partner to U.S. officials, as Abu Dhabi is
concerned that its close alliance with the U.S. will weaken if a
Democratic Party candidate defeats Trump in 2020. As Abu Dhabi's
hegemony over Aden complements its rising military presence on the Red
Sea and Horn of Africa, [the UAE will ensure that its troop drawdown
does not weaken its influence in southern Yemen]{.underline}. [The
Security Belt, a UAE-aligned south Yemeni paramilitary force, continues
to maintain a formidable military presence throughout southern
Yemen]{.underline}. [The UAE has also reportedly directed the STC to
establish a parallel army to the Hadi-controlled Yemeni
military]{.underline}. [Once this process is complete, the STC's
military force will consist of an estimated 52,000 south Yemeni troops
and sizable numbers of Emirati technical advisors**. This level of
military strength effectively prevents pro-Hadi or Houthi forces from
expelling the UAE's proxies through military force.**]{.underline} [The
rising unpopularity of the UAE's military presence in southern Yemen
also explains Abu Dhabi's shift towards more indirect power
projection]{.underline}. In mid-June, large anti-UAE protests erupted in
the oil-rich Shabwah region and demonstrators have called for an end to
the UAE's occupation of southern Yemen. The UAE is also unfavorably
viewed by the civilian population of Aden. Many residents of Aden
negatively recall Dubai-based port company DP World's administration of
the port from 2008 to 2012 and believe the UAE's exploitative policies
impoverished the local population. [**By empowering local military
forces, the UAE is able to shroud its hegemony in southern Yemen and
prevent large-scale popular unrest that would weaken its long-term
influence**. In order to repair its tarnished image and further its
geopolitical agenda, the UAE will likely expand its involvement in the
diplomatic resolution of the Yemeni civil war.]{.underline} It is
noteworthy that the UAE's withdrawal announcement followed UN special
envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths' July 2 trip to Abu Dhabi to discuss the
peace process. As the UAE's credibility as a mediator has been damaged
by its involvement in egregious human rights abuses and adversarial
relations with both the Houthis and Hadi's government, Abu Dhabi is
unlikely to promote cross-factional dialogue in Yemen. Instead, [the UAE
will likely use its economic clout and links to paramilitary groups as
points of leverage to influence the development of Yemen's post-war
political institutions.]{.underline} Once multilateral peace
negotiations resume, the UAE will lobby for Hadi's replacement by a new
president that is more amenable to Emirati interests. The UAE is also
expected to support the federalization of Yemen, as this outcome will
give southern Yemen greater autonomy and prolong Abu Dhabi's influence
over this strategically valuable region. These policy proposals could
exacerbate frictions between the UAE and Saudi Arabia on Yemen, but Abu
Dhabi hopes that both countries' common focus on isolating Iran and
Qatar will prevent these disagreements from weakening their strategic
alliance. **[Even though many international media outlets have conflated
the UAE's troop reductions in Yemen with a military withdrawal, the UAE
remains firmly committed to advancing its strategic interests in
Yemen]{.underline}**. [The UAE is likely to preserve its hegemony over
southern Yemen and could exert considerable influence over Yemen's
future political trajectory.]{.underline} Even if these successes are
achieved, however, Mohammed bin Zayed will struggle to distance the UAE
from its instrumental role in bringing about Yemen's humanitarian
catastrophe.

step, but it needs to be reciprocated,\" Middle East Institute,

[Reports that the UAE]{.underline}, a key member of the Saudi-led
coalition fighting in Yemen, [has decided to draw down and reposition
its troops should be welcomed and taken seriously. It is]{.underline}
not a small or symbolic move, but rather **[a serious, strategic, and
thoughtful military and political decision]{.underline}**. If
reciprocated by the Iranian-backed Houthi militia, [it could serve as
the long-awaited breakthrough in the five-year-old Yemen
war]{.underline}. Abu Dhabi\'s timely decision also has the potential to
create momentum to de-escalate tensions throughout the region, which are
currently at an all-time high. While not all of the details are known,
one thing is clear: [the UAE will not hastily leave Yemen or totally
pull out]{.underline}. Abu Dhabi and Riyadh are mindful of the havoc
that a sudden withdrawal and subsequent power vacuum could cause. Both
are ready to see the war end as quickly as possible, but for now that is
wishful thinking, especially given the disappointing initial reaction
from the Houthis to the UAE's latest gesture. [The UAE has been a major
actor]{.underline} in the five-year-old war in Yemen [and its decision
to draw down its military presence could be a **catalyst for a
significant de-escalation of the conflict**. It has no interest
whatsoever in prolonging the war in Yemen, and the force drawdown is a
positive step toward achieving that goal.]{.underline} Regardless of the
Houthis' negative reaction, the UAE forces will continue their phased
withdrawal. This includes, among other things, a major troop reduction
to around 4,000 soldiers, as well as the removal of heavy weapons like
tanks, artillery, and anti-missile systems. More than half of the UAE's
forces have already left the country from the southern port of Aden,
Hodeida, and Yemen's western coast. There has been a great deal of
speculation about the motives behind the UAE's decision to draw down its
forces. However, [the main rationale has]{.underline} less to do with
the recent escalation of tensions in the Gulf and [more to do with
encouraging developments on the ground in Yemen itself]{.underline},
notably the sharp drop in military activities throughout the country.
There had been near 80% drop in the first half of 2019 alone. The second
reason concerns the relative stalemate in the fight for the city and
port of Hodeida. Since the signing of the Stockholm agreement at the end
of 2018, there has been a stalemate around this crucial city --- a no
peace, no war situation. [The final consideration leading the UAE to
draw down its forces in Yemen is its confidence in the Yemeni local
forces to continue confronting the Houthis on their own.]{.underline}
The UAE has already trained a total of [90,000 Yemeni
forces]{.underline} who [are capable of filling the vacuum and
supporting the legitimate Yemeni government. They can do the job and are
well trained, well equipped, and battle tested. The UAE, **in close
consultation with Saudi Arabia** and with its full understanding, has
taken a strategic decision to scale back its presence in
Yemen]{.underline}. This decision can be a game changer in the conflict.
From now on no one should blame the UAE for prolonging the Yemen war.
This is a timely gesture by the UAE that should be taken seriously and
hopefully reciprocated if the intention is to end the war in Yemen and
de-escalate tensions in the region. While we hope the UAE move is a
beginning, we recognize that a lot more work is needed to bring the
conflict to an end.
