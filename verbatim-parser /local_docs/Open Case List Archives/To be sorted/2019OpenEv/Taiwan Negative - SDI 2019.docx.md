Paul [[Huang]{.underline}]{.mark}, an East Asia military analyst,
[[believes]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[China\'s verbal response]{.mark}
to the sale of the improved F-16s [will be strong]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
**[but]{.underline}**]{.mark} [noted that its [practical steps will
be]{.mark} **milder and \"far more
[constrained]{.mark}\".**]{.underline} Benjamin
[[Cavender]{.underline}]{.mark}, principal of the Shanghai-based China
Market Research Group, **[[agreed]{.underline}]{.mark}** [with
him]{.underline}, noting that Beijing has taken a firmer stance on
Taiwan in recent years, trying to downplay all demonstrations of the
island\'s \"sovereignty\".

[[Huang listed a range of **possible** responses from China if]{.mark}
Taiwan\'s [procurement of F-16s is approved]{.mark} in the
US]{.underline}. According to him, Beijing could cut ties between the
two states\' militaries, try to deprive Taiwan of its diplomatic allies,
retaliate against companies involved in the production of F-16s, such as
Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, or even intensify exports of sensitive
military technologies to countries of concern to the US, such as Iran.

[The military analyst also drew]{.underline} up two extreme [scenarios,
although he marked them as]{.underline} **[\"highly
unlikely\".]{.underline}** One such scenario would have China cutting
all diplomatic ties with the US, whereas in the other, Beijing would use
the F-16 procurement as a pretext for launching military action against
Taiwan.

[[\"It is]{.underline} **[extremely unlikely]{.underline}**]{.mark} that
the [[arms sales]{.underline} **[alone]{.underline}** [would be a
factor]{.underline}]{.mark} [in Beijing\'s strategic calculus in making
such a decision]{.underline}, however\", [he said]{.underline}.

[The analyst noted]{.underline}, though, that
**[[most]{.underline}]{.mark}** of these [[responses would]{.mark}
**either [have]{.mark} only [a mild effect or cause more trouble for
Beijing]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[than]{.mark} for [Washington or
Taiwan]{.mark}.]{.underline} He said that the [[Chinese]{.mark} Armed
[Forces]{.mark}]{.underline} are [[get]{.underline}]{.mark}ting [[more
**out of**]{.mark} **their [coop]{.mark}eration**]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} their [America]{.underline}n colleagues [than vice
versa, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} that [military [supplies to]{.mark}
American [rivals]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[would only trigger
counter-measures]{.underline}**]{.mark} [from the US]{.underline}
against China. [He also added]{.underline} that [measures targeting
US]{.underline} military [contractors]{.underline} **[would have little
effect]{.underline}**, as [their presence in China is
minimal]{.underline}.

#### It's [empirically denied]{.underline} from the [threat of sanctions]{.underline}

Diplomat*, December 18^th^, 2015, Available Online at:

Interestingly, [[the promised sanctions against U.S.
firms]{.underline}]{.mark} (which, as is the case today, were always a
vague concept) [[**never came**. That may be]{.mark} in part
[because]{.mark} two of [the firms involved]{.mark} in the 2010
sale]{.underline} -- Boeing and General Electric -- [[have major
commercial interests in China. Actually following]{.mark}
[through]{.mark} on sanctioning these companies [would have been a
**serious escalation**]{.mark} in an already-tense
relationship]{.underline}.

In September 2011, the United States announced a \$5.9 billion upgrade
package for Taiwan's F-16A/B fighter jets, to a fairly muted reaction
from Beijing. Once again, a vice foreign minister (this time Zhang
Zhijun) summoned the U.S. ambassador (then Gary Locke) to lodge a
protest. Zhang warned the sale would "inevitably" take a toll on the
overall relationship, especially military ties. Yet, even though one
Chinese military officer urged China to "take revenge" in an article for
the People's Daily, Beijing didn't take major steps to retaliate for the
sale. A few U.S.-China military contacts were postponed, but nothing on
the scale of 2010's break.

Part of that, however, may have been related to timing -- Beijing was
unwilling to create a huge issue in U.S.-China relations only a few
months before a heavily anticipated tour of the United States by then
president-in-waiting Xi Jinping. Xi's February 2012 visit to the U.S.
was seen as a display of his foreign policy prowess ahead of his
actually assuming China's top leadership roles; Beijing needed the visit
to go off smoothly. Meanwhile, Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou, who had
spearheaded a warming of cross-strait relations during his first term,
faced reelection in January 2012. China's leadership may have decided to
cut Ma a break by not lashing out over the arms sale, in the hopes he
would win reelection (and he did).

So, with that background, what should we make of this week's reaction
from Beijing? First, it's interesting that [[China]{.mark} [summoned the
U.S. charge d'affaires]{.mark}]{.underline}, rather than Ambassador Max
Baucus himself, to lodge its protest -- [[that suggests a more moderate
response]{.underline}]{.mark}. Military relations will likely suffer in
the short term, but given the intense work both sides have put into
institutionalizing those ties since 2011, [[a serious
break]{.underline}]{.mark} a la 2010 [[would]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[be]{.underline}]{.mark} a huge blow, and [likely [farther than Beijing
wants to go for the smallest Taiwan arms sale yet]{.mark}]{.underline}
of the Obama administration.

The proposed sanctions on U.S. companies are interesting, as it provides
a new lever for Beijing to pull when responding to these arms sales. And
despite what many observers dismiss as pro forma responses from China,
it should be noted that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan remain the top issue
of concern listed by Chinese military officials when discussing the
relationship. But [[Beijing has made the sanctions threat before and not
followed through]{.underline}]{.mark} -- much as the Obama
administration has yet to follow through on its threat to sanction
Chinese companies profiting from cyber espionage. [The threat alone
remains a useful policy tool, and [Beijing may again decide that
warnings -- **rather than action** -- are enough.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[["\'Stability trumps all\']{.underline}]{.mark}, as the Chinese saying
goes \-- I think this is more true today than ever before."
[[Some]{.underline}]{.mark} observers have [[argue]{.underline}]{.mark}d
that [[a weaker]{.mark} Chinese [leader]{.mark}, faced with a slowing
economy, [might]{.mark} be more prone to [provok]{.mark}ing
[confrontation]{.mark}]{.underline}, raising the potential for clashes
between China's fast-modernizing military, and regional rivals with whom
relations have been tense, including U.S. allies such as the
Philippines, Taiwan or Japan. The latter has just angered Beijing by
passing laws allowing its military to engage in overseas actions as well
as simply self-defense, for the first time since World War II.
[[However]{.underline}]{.mark}, Lam says that [[a more chastened

confrontation]{.underline} with the U.S. over the South China Sea [is
[the last thing Xi needs]{.mark} at present,]{.underline} Lam adds. ["[A

#### CCP resilient -- no alternative, reforms solve, public polls prove support, and empirical trends

**Heath 15** \-\-\-- Timothy, M.A. in Asian Studies (George Washington
University), Senior International Defense Research Analyst at RAND,
former Senior Analyst for the USPACOM China Strategic Focus Group, "No,
China's Not About to Collapse," The Diplomat, 3/13,
<http://thediplomat.com/2015/03/no-chinas-not-about-to-collapse/>

The [[CCP]{.underline}]{.mark}'s [liabilities are well
known]{.underline}. These include an antiquated political identity,
cumbersome ideology, and widespread disenchantment with Marxism among
the public (and among more than a few party members). CCP-led government
has failed to provide adequate services, ensure rule of law, and has
long tolerated corruption, malfeasance, and widening inequality. Many of
these vulnerabilities have persisted for years, and some have worsened
over time. [The party's [advantages]{.mark} are less often discussed,
but these [bear reviewing]{.mark}]{.underline} [if one is to evaluate
the viability of CCP rule]{.underline}. One of the most overlooked, but
[[important]{.underline}]{.mark}, assets [[is]{.mark} a **[lack of
any]{.mark} credible [alt]{.mark}ernative**]{.underline}. [The party's
[**repressive politics** prevent]{.mark}]{.underline} the formation of
[potential [candidates]{.mark}, so the alternative]{.underline} to CCP
rule for now [is anarchy. For a country still traumatized
by]{.underline} its historic experience with [national breakdown, this
grants the party [no small advantage]{.mark}.]{.underline} To truly
imperil its authority, [the [CCP would need to be]{.mark}have in so
damaging a manner as to make the certainty of political chaos and
economic collapse]{.underline} [preferable to the continuation of CCP
rule. A party that attempted to return to extreme [Mao]{.mark}-era
policies]{.underline} such as the catastrophic Great Leap Forward could
perhaps meet that threshold. But [[despite]{.mark} the numerous
[superficial comparisons]{.mark}]{.underline} [in Western media,
[little]{.mark} about the current administration policy agenda
[resembles]{.mark} classic Maoism. The [second major]{.mark} political
[advantage lies in **improvements**]{.mark} to the party's effectiveness
[in recent years]{.mark}. [In a major]{.mark} paradigm
[shift]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the [CCP redefined]{.mark}]{.underline}
[itself [as a "governing party]{.mark}" whose primary responsibility
rests in]{.underline} addressing the myriad [economic, political,
cultural, ecological, and social welfare demands of the people. It has
carried out ideological and political [reforms]{.mark} to
[improve]{.mark} its [competence and effectiveness]{.mark}
accordingly]{.underline}. The [Xi]{.underline} administration
[has]{.underline} refined, but [upheld, the focus on
increasing]{.underline} the nation's standard of living and realizing
national revitalization, objectives embodied in the vision of [the
"Chinese dream]{.underline}." [Although the party has]{.underline}
rightly [come in for criticism for moving slowly]{.underline} and
inadequately on these issues, [[the]{.mark} policy [agenda]{.mark}
nevertheless appears to [resonate]{.mark} with the majority of Chinese
citizens]{.underline}. [Independent [polls]{.mark} consistently
[show]{.mark} that the party has in recent years enjoyed surprisingly
[strong public support]{.mark}. When weighing]{.underline} the party's
political [liabilities against]{.underline} its [assets]{.underline},
therefore, the [evidence suggests]{.underline} that [the **[CCP faces
little danger of]{.mark} imminent [collapse]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
[Improvements]{.underline} to its cohesion, competence, and
responsiveness, [combined with a policy agenda that resonates with most
Chinese and the lack of a compelling alternative outweigh the persistent
political liabilities]{.underline}. The party's [overall political
[stability]{.mark} throughout the 2000s]{.underline},
[**[despite]{.mark} massive [political unrest]{.mark}** generated by
breakneck economic growth, [underscores this]{.mark} point.]{.underline}

### CCP\-\--Ext\-\--No War

#### No lash-out

Eastern Economic Review, M.A. Oxford, 2004, China's Democratic Future,
p. 114

Yet [the [risks, **even** to a dying regime, may be **too
high**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [An unprovoked attack]{.underline} on
Taiwan [would]{.underline} almost certainly [bring the U.S.]{.underline}
and its allies [to the island\'s rescue]{.underline}. Those forces would
not stop at Taiwan but might march on Beijing and oust the CCP, or
attempt to do so through stiff sanctions, calling it a threat to
regional and world peace. Such an attack might also face the opposition
of the peoples of Fujian, who would be expected to provide logis¬tical
support and possibly bear the worst burdens of war. They, like much of
coastal China, look to Taiwan for investment and culture and have a
close affinity with the island. As a result, there are doubts about
whether such a plan could be put into action. [A [failed war would
prompt]{.mark} a Taiwan declaration of independence and a [further
backlash]{.mark} against the CCP at home]{.underline}, just as the May
Fourth students of 1919 berated the Republican government for weakness
in the face of foreign powers. [Failed wars brought down authoritarian
regimes in Greece and Portugal]{.underline} in 1974 and in Argentina in
1983. [[**Even if** CCP leaders wanted war, it is unlikely that the
**PLA** would oblige]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Top [officers would
see]{.mark} the **[disastrous implications]{.mark}**]{.underline} of
attacking Taiwan. [Military [caution would]{.mark} also [guard
against]{.mark} the]{.underline} even wilder [scenario of
the]{.underline} [[use of nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}
against Japan or the U.S.47 [At the height of the Tiananmen
protests]{.underline} it appears [there was consideration given to the
use of nuclear weapons]{.underline} in case the battle to suppress the
protestors drew in outside countries.48 [But even then, the [threats did
not]{.mark} appear to [gain **even minimal
support**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [In an atmosphere in which [the
military]{.mark} is [think]{.mark}ing [about its **future**]{.mark}, the
resort to [nuclear confrontation **would not make

#### Qualitative and quantitative studies disprove diversion -- Falklands and invasion of Cyprus

External Conflict," Security Studies 19(2), 10/26, available via MIT

The [stakes in the validity of the diversionary hypothesis are
deceptively high]{.underline}. As a domestic-level explanation of
international conflict, it offers one of several important alternatives
to rationalist explanations of war based on the state as a unitary
actor.6 Strong empirical support for diversion would confirm another
pathway to international conflict, complementing those based on
rationalist approaches. By contrast, [limited support]{.underline} for
diversion [would cast doubt on one class of second-image theories of
international conflict. Despite two decades of renewed research,
cumulative [knowledge]{.mark} [on diversion **remains
elusive**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Quantitative [[studies contain]{.mark}
**mixed and often [contradictory]{.mark} empirical
[results]{.mark}**]{.underline} regarding the relationship between
internal and external conflict. Some studies find a positive
relationship between indicators of domestic dissatisfaction and threats
or uses of force in analysis of U.S. behavior7 and in cross-national
studies.8 By contrast, other [[research identifies a]{.mark} **weak or
[nonexistent relationship]{.mark}** between]{.underline} these same
[variables]{.underline}.9 Indeed, [[the gap]{.mark} between the
intuition]{.underline} underlying diversion as a motive for conflict
[and existing quantitative research]{.underline} that Jack
[[Levy]{.mark} [noted]{.mark}]{.underline} in 1989 [[continues]{.mark}
to characterize this research program today]{.underline}.10
[Given]{.underline} the [mixed empirical results]{.underline} in recent
quantitative research, [this article offers a different type of
test]{.underline} of the diversionary hypothesis. In particular, [I
extend efforts to employ case study methods to test the hypothesis
systematically]{.underline} and against alternative explanations in
specific episodes of historical interest.11 Adopting a modified "most
likely" approach to theory testing pioneered by Harry Eckstein[, [I
examine two cases that *should be easy for diversion*]{.mark}*ary theory
[to explain]{.mark}*[:]{.mark} Argentina's]{.underline} 1982 [seizure of
the Falkland]{.underline} (Malvinas) Islands a[nd Turkey's]{.underline}
1974 [invasion of Cyprus]{.underline}. In these episodes, high levels of
domestic political unrest preceded the escalation of salient disputes
that leaders could manipulate to rally public support or demonstrate
their competence as statesmen. These [[cases *should be
homeruns*]{.mark} for the diversionary hypothesis, **[but]{.mark} they
[are]{.mark} in fact quite [difficult]{.mark} for it to
explain**]{.underline}. In these cases, [[the relationship]{.mark}
between domestic political conflict and dispute escalation [is **weak at
best**, as the onset]{.mark} and magnitude of social [unrest was **only
linked loosely** with]{.mark} decisions to use [force]{.mark}. Leaders'
[statements]{.mark}]{.underline} and reasoning [[provide little
evidence]{.mark} for diversion]{.underline} as a central motivation for
escalation. Instead, [a standard realist model of international politics
and]{.underline} the dynamics of [coercive diplomacy offer a more
compelling explanation]{.underline} of Argentine and Turkish decision
making.12 [[Leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} in these states [[chose force
in response]{.mark} to external threats to national interests,
**[not]{.mark}**]{.underline} internal threats [[to]{.underline}]{.mark}
their [[political survival]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### The psycho-social explanation for diversion is illogical -- This evidence also proves your studies suck -- rally too short/can backfire, selection effect dissuades, alternate measures for peace -- tons of history goes neg

Studies Program (MIT), "The Limits of Diversion: Rethinking Internal and
External Conflict," Security Studies 19(2), 10/26, available via MIT
Open Access

[My findings have several implications for]{.underline} the literature
on [diversion]{.underline}ary war theory. [At the most general level of
analysis, the [lack of support for]{.mark} the]{.underline}
[[diversion]{.underline}]{.mark} [hypothesis [in Argentina and Turkey
complements]{.mark} those [quantitative studies]{.mark} of diversion
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[do not identify a]{.mark} systematic and
significant [relationship]{.mark}]{.underline}** between domestic
politics and aggressive foreign policies, including the use of force.127
[In addition, the modified [most likely]{.mark} research [design
used]{.mark}]{.underline} in this article **[raises
[questions]{.mark}]{.underline}** [about those quantitative [studies
that do provide]{.mark} empirical [support]{.mark}]{.underline} for
diversion [because it demonstrates that [despite]{.mark} the presence of
domestic [unrest, the]{.mark} underlying causal
[mechanisms]{.mark}]{.underline} of diversion [[may not account for the
decisions]{.mark} to use force.]{.underline} The lack of support for
diversion raises a simple but important question: [[why is diversion
less frequent]{.underline}]{.mark} than commonly believed,
*[[despite]{.mark} its plausible [intuition]{.mark}?]{.underline}*
Although further research is required, several factors should be
considered. First, [the [rally]{.mark} effect]{.underline} that leaders
enjoy from an international crisis [[is]{.mark} **generally
[brief]{.mark} in duration and [unlikely to change]{.mark} permanently a
public's overall [satisfaction]{.mark}** with its
leader]{.underline}s.128 George H. W. [[Bush]{.underline}]{.mark}, for
example, [[lost]{.mark} his [reelection]{.mark} bid
[after]{.mark}]{.underline} successful prosecution of [[the]{.mark} 1991
[Gulf War]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Winston [Churchill fared no
better after]{.underline} the [Allied victory in World War
II.]{.underline}129 [[Leaders have little reason to
conclude]{.underline}]{.mark} that a [[short-term rally will
address]{.underline}]{.mark} what are usually
**[[structural]{.underline}]{.mark}** [sources of domestic
[dissatisfaction]{.mark}]{.underline}. Second, a [[selection]{.mark}
effect [may prevent]{.mark} embattled [leaders from choosing
diversion]{.mark}. Diversion]{.underline}ary action [should produce the
largest]{.underline} rally [effect against the most powerful
target]{.underline} because such action would reflect a leader's skills
through coercing a superior opponent. [At the same time, [leaders
should]{.mark}]{.underline} often [be [deterred from]{.mark} challenging
[stronger targets]{.mark}]{.underline}, as the imbalance of military
forces increases the risk of defeat and thus the probability of losing
office at home. [[Although]{.mark} the [odds of victory increase when
targeting]{.mark} [weak]{.mark}er states, [success]{.mark} should [have
a]{.mark} much more [muted effect]{.mark} on domestic
support]{.underline}, if any, because **[victory would have been
expected]{.underline}**.130 Third, weak or [embattled [leaders can
choose]{.mark} from [a wide range of]{.mark}]{.underline} policy
[[options]{.mark} to strengthen their standing]{.underline} at home.
Although scholars such as [[Oakes and Gelpi]{.underline}]{.mark} have
[[noted]{.mark} that embattled [leaders]{.mark} can [choose repression
or]{.mark} economic [development]{.mark}]{.underline} in addition to
diversionary action, [the range of options is **even greater and carries
less risk** than the failure of diversion]{.underline}. [[Weak leaders
**can also seek**]{.mark} **to deepen
[cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline} with other states if they believe it
will strengthen their position at home. Other [studies]{.underline}, for
example, [have demonstrated]{.underline} that [political [unrest
facilitated détente]{.mark} among the superpowers in the early 1970s,
China's concessions]{.underline} in its many territorial disputes,
[support for international financial liberalization, and the formation
of regional organizations]{.underline} such as the Association of
Southeast Asian States and the Gulf Cooperation Council. 131 The
[findings]{.underline} from these two cases also [carry implications for
future empirical tests of the diversionary hypothesis and the broader
relationship between internal and external conflict.]{.underline} To
start, given the common view within the field of international relations
that some past conflicts are best explained by diversionary motives,
additional [case [studies are needed to test diversion]{.mark}ary claims
[against **plausible**]{.mark} **alternative
[explanations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In other cases that scholars have
cast as diversionary, for example, evidence exists that casts doubt upon
the hypothesis]{.underline}. Historian Arno
[[Mayer]{.underline}]{.mark}, among others, [is often
[cited]{.mark}]{.underline} as providing support for
[[diversion]{.underline}]{.mark} through his argument that domestic
crises [accounted [for]{.mark} key decisions leading to the outbreak of
[World War I]{.mark}]{.underline} (as well as other conflicts) in
Europe.132 **[[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark}** in his analysis of German
decision making before 1914, Dale [[Copeland finds]{.mark} leadership
[statements]{.mark} that [disconfirm the]{.mark} diversionary
[hypothesis]{.mark}]{.underline}. As early as 1905-06, for instance,
Admiral [Tirpitz concluded]{.underline} that [war in Europe would only
"cause chaos at home]{.underline}," not increase societal cohesion.133
[[Similarly, the]{.mark} 1904-05 [Russo-Japanese war is]{.mark} often
[mentioned]{.mark}]{.underline} as another example of diversion. One of
the key pieces of evidence to support his claim comes from a memoir of a
Russian official, Count Sergei Witte, who quotes V. K. Pleve, minister
of the interior at the time, as stating that "we need a little
victorious war to stem the tide of revolution."134 Geoffrey [[Blainey
notes]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[however]{.underline}**, [[numerous
problems]{.mark} with this statement as evidence of Russian decision
making]{.underline}: the quote appeared in a memoir that was penned
eight years later, Witte and Pleve were rivals, and Witte in other parts
of the memoir that analyzes the war includes no other statements that
would support a diversionary explanation.135 [These two examples suggest
that a **thorough audit of other diversionary cases would be
helpful**.]{.underline} In addition, although smoking-gun evidence in
leadership statements may be impossible to find, [scholars can use case
study methods to test diversionary arguments against alternative
explanations.]{.underline} In particular, scholars can trace changes in
the domestic political environment with foreign policy decision making
to identify a clear relationship between domestic political strife and
plans to threaten or use force. Scholars can also examine leadership
statements for evidence consistent with diversion, such as concern about
their domestic political standing or the anticipated effects of an
external conflict on domestic politics.

China's huge internal security budget reveals that [the Party is uneasy
about the ferment of social changes]{.underline} it has unleashed
[with]{.underline} its [modernization]{.underline} of the country.
Protests in China are no longer illegal so long as they do not call for
the downfall of the CCP but attending them can be risky. Despite this
tens of thousands of single issue protests break out across the country
every year according to human rights groups, the vast majority concerned
with corruption, development concerns or environmental problems. For all
China is a one-party state, [the regime of [Xi]{.mark} Jinping is
**[keen to stay ahead of]{.mark} the [issues]{.mark}** that matter to
the Chinese public, [as shown by]{.mark} his draconian
anti-**[corruption campaign]{.mark}**]{.underline} since coming to
power. The idea of [a nation-wide green movement]{.underline} taking off
in the country [that could not be assuaged by closing an
unpopular]{.underline} chemical [plant]{.underline} or sacking a hated
local government official [is anathema to Beijing]{.underline}.
President [[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping [has]{.underline} therefore
[shown himself to be more inclined to **[take green issues into
account]{.mark}**]{.underline} than his predecessors, who focused more
closely on economic development. [He has [committed to capping]{.mark}
carbon [emissions]{.mark}]{.underline} by 2030 [and turning to renewable
sources]{.underline} for 20 percent of the country's energy. By 2013
China had even become the world's largest producer of wind and solar
power. Increasingly the CCP must balancing its mission to lift the many
more millions of Chinese who remain in grinding poverty against the
costs of climate change and pollution that creating this wealth often
entails. With a growing middle class increasingly outspoken about living
in smog-ridden cities reminiscent of the early industrial revolution,
Beijing is looking at radical changes in how its economy operates. Some
observers think that China has realized it must go green for its own
survival, but just as likely is that [[the CCP]{.mark} has
**[calculated]{.mark} that, as with corruption**]{.underline}, [[the
limits of public tolerance]{.mark} for pollution]{.underline}, public
health scandals and massive industrial accidents [has been tested to
dangerous limits]{.underline}. Since 1989 [Chinese politics has worked
on the operating principle that [popular discontent]{.mark} must
[never]{.mark} be allowed to [build up
**unchecked**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Arab Spring protests of 2010-11
which swept away a clutch of fossilized and underperforming
authoritarian regimes in the Middle East with a wave of street protests
were seen as a warning in Beijing. As a result [it stepped up repression
of civil society activists including environmental
activists]{.underline}, anticorruption campaigners or defense lawyers,
but scrutinized many of their concerns more intently. Beijing's monopoly
on political power still rests on showing that it can deliver economic
growth and rising living standards. But the costs of a rapid industrial
development, and the attendant explosion of consumerism among 1.5
billion people have taken their toll. Under Xi Jinping it has become a
mature middle-sized economy that is now pondering what kind of society
it would like to be by 2050. Affluence is creating more interest in
social issues. People power movements are already a well-established
phenomenon in local politics in China going back many years, but there
has been no national movement since the suppression of pro-democracy
protestors in 1989. The CCP fears that allowing any widespread
organization on social issues will quickly turn political and lead to
the overthrow of the communist system. It cites examples such as the
Polish Solidarity trade union movement which led to the eventual
democratization of Poland over of the course of the 1980s or the more
recent Color Revolutions. Unlike various secular Arab regimes however,
[[the CCP]{.mark} has [long proved adept at **anticipating and diffusing
popular concerns before they become a mortal threat to**]{.mark} **the
[Party]{.mark}'s political [survival]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
[suppression of pro-democracy protests]{.underline} stalled but [did not
stop a]{.underline} pre-existing economic [program to develop
the]{.underline} Chinese [economy]{.underline}. [Once]{.underline}
rising living standards had been achieved and official [corruption was
becoming]{.underline} a [pressing]{.underline} issue [the Party moved to
clean up]{.underline} these Augean stables itself, [without]{.underline}
subjecting CCP cadres to [an independent judiciary]{.underline}. It had
already begun to soften its rhetoric on global warming under the
previous leadership team around Hu Jintao. [There is no reason to
suppose that [as green issues become]{.mark}s [more important]{.mark}
globally and locally that the leadership of [the CCP will]{.mark} not
move to **[co-opt and ingratiate itself]{.mark}** with the
movements]{.underline} that emerge to tackle it. Whether this will help
or harm the cause of green politics in China itself will be determined
by the CCP's ability to deliver on its promises. If Beijing cannot, it
may find itself facing the very public protests it is currently trying
to head off.

#### Empirics

Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 3/12. "Will the Chinese
Communist Party Survive the Crisis?" Foreign Affairs.
<http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/64862/minxin-pei/will-the-chinese-communist-party-survive-the-crisis>

It might seem reasonable to expect that challenges from the disaffected
urban middle class, frustrated college graduates, and unemployed
migrants will constitute the principal threat to the party\'s rule. If
those groups were in fact to band together in a powerful coalition, then
the world\'s longest-ruling party would indeed be in deep trouble. But
that is not going to happen. Such [a revolutionary [scenario
overlooks]{.mark} two [critical forces blocking political change]{.mark}
in China]{.underline} and similar authoritarian political systems: [the
regime\'s [**capacity for repression** and]{.mark} the [**unity** among
the elite]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Economic crisis and social
[unrest]{.mark} may make it tougher for the CCP to govern, but they
[**will not loosen** the party\'s hold]{.mark} on power. A glance at
countries such as Zimbabwe, North Korea, Cuba, and Burma shows
that]{.underline} a relatively [[unified elite]{.mark} in control of the
military and police [can **cling** to power]{.mark} through brutal
force, [**even** in]{.mark} the [face of abysmal econ]{.mark}omic
[failure]{.mark}]{.underline}. Disunity within the ruling elite, on the
other hand, weakens the regime\'s repressive capacity and usually spells
the rulers\' doom. [The [CCP]{.mark} has **[already
demonstrated]{.mark}** its [remarkable ability to]{.mark} contain and
[suppress]{.mark} chronic social [protest]{.mark} and small-scale
dissident movements. The regime maintains the People\'s Armed
Police]{.underline}, a well-trained and well-equipped anti-riot force of
250,000. In addition, [China\'s secret police are among the most capable
in the world]{.underline} and are augmented by a vast network of
informers. And although the Internet may have made control of
information more difficult, [Chinese [censors]{.mark}]{.underline} can
still [[react quickly]{.mark} and thoroughly to end the dissemination of
dangerous news]{.underline}. Since the Tiananmen crackdown, the Chinese
government has greatly refined its repressive capabilities. [[Responding
to]{.mark} tens of thousands of [riots]{.mark} each year has [made
Chinese]{.mark} law enforcement the most **[experienced]{.mark}** in the
world at crowd control and dispersion]{.underline}. Chinese state
security services have applied the tactic of \"political decapitation\"
to great effect, quickly arresting protest leaders and leaving their
followers disorganized, demoralized, and impotent. If worsening economic
conditions lead to a potentially explosive political situation, the
party will stick to these tried-and-true practices to ward off any
organized movement against the regime.

While Washington is focused on Russian election interference, [[China
is]{.underline} **[rapidly advancing]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[its]{.underline} own [[election-meddling]{.mark} capability [using
social media]{.mark}, illicit [funding and]{.mark} [false news]{.mark}.
The [Chinese]{.mark} government's]{.underline}
[**[massive]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[successful
interference]{.underline}** [in Taiwan's elections]{.underline}]{.mark}
last month [[shows]{.underline} [Beijing is **getting into the
game**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[in a major way]{.underline}**.

Washington is slowly but surely waking up to China's multifaceted
foreign influence operations. But many here remain skeptical about the
threat of Beijing's direct interference in American politics. The Trump
administration said Beijing interfered in the 2018 U.S. midterm
elections, but there wasn't a ton of visible evidence. [After
what]{.underline} just [happened in Taiwan]{.underline}, however,
[**[few]{.underline}** [can]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[argue]{.mark}
that [the]{.mark}]{.underline} Chinese Communist Party
([[CCP]{.underline}) [doesn't have the means
**and**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[the [motive]{.mark}]{.underline}** [to
perpetrate]{.underline} such [acts]{.underline}.

"[[CCP **attempts to erode democratic processes**]{.mark} **and norms
[around the world]{.mark}**]{.underline} [threaten U.S.
partnerships]{.underline} and prosperity," six U.S.
[[senators]{.underline}]{.mark}, led by Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.)

letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Treasury Secretary Steven
Mnuchin, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and FBI Director
Christopher Wray. ["Allegations]{.underline} **[such as those
surrounding Taiwan's recent elections]{.underline}** [must]{.underline}
therefore [be pursued]{.underline} with seriousness and urgency."

The [[senators asked]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [to work with
Taiwan]{.underline}ese authorities [[to investigate]{.underline}]{.mark}
events leading up to the November elections that saw [**[sweeping
losses]{.underline}** [for the]{.underline}]{.mark} ruling Democratic
Progressive Party ([[DPP]{.underline}) [and]{.underline}]{.mark} its
leader President [[Tsai]{.underline}]{.mark} Ing-wen. [Beijing carried
out **a massive**]{.underline} [propaganda and social media campaign
that spread false news]{.underline} designed [to]{.underline}
**[undermine Tsai's government]{.underline}**. The CCP refuses to deal
with Tsai in objection to her cross-Strait policies.

[[Tsai]{.underline} **[futilely]{.underline}** [urged
Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}ese citizens [[to see Beijing's effort
for]{.mark} what it was]{.underline} --- **[[a Russian-style influence
campaign]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The island's 23 million [[citizens
were]{.underline} **[bombarded]{.underline}**]{.mark} [with anti-Tsai
and anti-DPP content]{.underline} through Facebook, Twitter and online
chat groups, promoted by China's "50-cent army" of paid social media
trolls. [[There are]{.mark} also]{.underline} [**[dozens]{.underline}**
[of investigations into]{.underline}]{.mark} [allegations]{.underline}
that [[Chinese money]{.mark} went [to]{.mark}]{.underline} fund
[Taiwanese [candidates]{.mark}]{.underline} [[opposing Tsai]{.mark} and

"If true, [CCP interference]{.underline} in Taiwan's elections [would be
**deeply concerning**]{.underline} [not only for Taiwan]{.underline}'s
future, **[but also for fellow democracies]{.underline}** around the
world where the CCP may choose to interfere," [the senators
wrote]{.underline}. "In an era of growing authoritarian interference, we
believe such [allegations must be taken seriously]{.underline} if free
societies are to continue to thrive."

["[The PRC is]{.mark} engaged [in]{.mark} an]{.underline}

#### Democracy resilient -- overwhelming public backing supports gains

**Wollack 16** \-\-\-- Kenneth, president of the National Democratic
Institute, former co-editor of the Middle East Policy Survey, former
senior fellow at UCLA's School for Public Affairs, "How Resilient is
Democracy?" This text is the transcript from an interview with Alexander
Heffner, PBS -- The Open Mind, 10/15,
<http://www.thirteen.org/openmind/government/how-resilient-is-democracy/5553/>

Well I think [[we're seeing]{.mark} a number of phenomena]{.underline}
that [take place]{.underline}. Um, first of all [you have [new
democracies]{.mark}]{.underline} around the world, that are
[[struggling]{.underline}]{.mark} to deliver for its people. New
institutions, political institutions that for the first time have
legitimacy among the people, but in order to succeed and sustain their
democratic system, they have to deliver on quality of life issues for,
for the entire population. And if those institutions don't deliver in
many of these new democracies that have emerged over the last forty
years, uh, then you're gonna see backsliding and people will either go
to the streets or vote for a populist demagogue who promises to bring
sort of instant solutions to their problems. And then [in non-democratic
countries, you have]{.underline} what is called [[authoritarian
learning]{.underline}]{.mark}, and that is autocrats today that are
smarter than they were before, uh, that are fearful of diffusion of
political power, uh, fearful of losing power themselves. Um, and they
are using uh, traditional means and new legal means in which to repress
the population, prevent the emergence of civil society, and not to speak
of opposition political parties. [[And]{.underline}]{.mark} then [you
have]{.underline} a situation that you see in a number of countries in
the Middle East where you have a [[sectarian strife]{.underline}]{.mark}
and conflict. Uh, [**[but]{.underline}** [in all]{.underline}]{.mark}
[of these situations]{.underline}, what [[you find]{.underline}]{.mark}
is **[[democratic resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}**. That
[[people]{.mark} around the world basically [want the same]{.mark}
thing. [They want]{.mark}]{.underline} to put [[food]{.mark} on their
table]{.underline}, uh, they want to have [jobs]{.underline} and
[[shelter and]{.underline}]{.mark} they want [**[a political
voice]{.mark}**.]{.underline} And that, [those aspirations
and]{.underline} those [hopes]{.underline}, uh, and those desires as I
said [are universal]{.underline}, and [[if you look]{.mark} [at]{.mark}
public opinion [polls]{.mark} **[around the
world]{.mark}**]{.underline}, uh, [[people]{.mark} **do [want]{.mark} to
have [democratic systems]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that allow]{.mark}
them to participate in the [political life]{.mark} of their
country]{.underline}. And that is, [[we are in the]{.underline}
**[optimism business]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [we
[believe]{.mark}]{.underline} in people and I think that [ultimately
those [efforts]{.mark}]{.underline}, um, will, **[[will
succeed]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But they need a lot of support, they
need backing, um, uh, in order for uh, some very brave and courageous
people to, to move the democratic for---uh, process forward in some of
the most unlikely places in the world.

#### Democracy doesn't cause peace -- statistical models are spurious and don't assume economic growth

**Mousseau, 12** (Michael -- Professor IR Koç University, "The
Democratic Peace Unraveled: It's the Economy" International Studies
Quarterly, p 1-12)

Model 2 presents new knowledge by adding the control for economic type.
To capture the dyadic expectation of peace among contract-intensive
nations, the variable Contract- intensive EconomyL (CIEL) indicates the
value of impersonal contracts in force per capita of the state with the
lower level of CIE in the dyad; a high value of this measure indicates
both states have contract-intensive economies. As can be seen, the
coefficient for CIEL ()0.80) is negative and highly significant. This
corroborates that impersonal economy is a highly robust force for peace.
The coefficient for DemocracyL is now at zero. There are no other
differences between Models 1 and 2, whose samples are identical, and no
prior study corroborating the democratic peace has considered
contractintensive economy. Therefore, the standard econometric inference
to be drawn from Model 2 is the nontrivial result that **[[all prior
reports of democracy as a force for peace]{.mark} [are]{.mark} probably
[spurious]{.mark}, since [this result is]{.mark} predicted and [fully
accounted for by]{.mark} [economic norms]{.mark} theory.]{.underline}**
[CIEL and DemocracyL correlate only in the moderate range of
0.47]{.underline} (Pearson's r), [so the insignificance of democracy is
not likely to be a statistical artifact of
multicollinearity]{.underline}. This is corroborated by the variance
inflation factor for DemocracyL in Model 2 of 1.85, which is well below
the usual rule-of-thumb indicator of multicollinearity of 10 or more.
Nor should readers assume most democratic dyads have both states with
impersonal economies: While almost all nations with contract-intensive
economies (as indicated with the binary measure for CIE) are democratic
(Polity2 \> 6) (Singapore is the only long-term exception), more than
half---55%---of all democratic nation-years have contract-poor
economies. At the dyadic level in this sample, this translates to 80% of
democratic dyads (all dyads where DemocracyBinary6 = 1) that have at
least one state with a contract-poor economy. In other words, [not only
does [Model]{.mark} 2 [show **no evidence of causation from democracy to
peace**]{.mark}]{.underline} (as reported in Mousseau 2009), [but it
also illustrates that this absence of democratic [peace]{.mark} includes
the vast majority]{.underline}---80%---[of democratic dyad-years over
the sample period]{.underline}. [[Nor is it likely]{.mark} that [the
causal arrow is]{.mark} [reversed]{.mark}---[with democracy being
the]{.mark} ultimate [cause of]{.mark} contract-intensive [economy and
peace]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is because [correlations among
independent variables are not calculated in the results of multivariate
regressions: Coefficients show only the effect of each variable after
the potential effects of the others are kept constant]{.underline} at
their mean levels. [If it was democracy that caused both impersonal
economy and peace, then there would be some variance in DemocracyL
remaining]{.underline}, after its partial correlation with CIEL is
excluded, that links it directly with peace. [The positive direction of
the coefficient for DemocracyL informs us that [no such direct effect
exists]{.mark}]{.underline} (Blalock 1979:473--474). Model 3 tests for
the effect of DemocracyL if a control is added for mixed-polity dyads,
as suggested by Russett (2010:201). As discussed above, to avoid
problems of mathematical endogeneity, I adopt the solution used by
Mousseau, Orsun and Ungerer (2013) and measure regime difference as
proposed by Werner (2000), drawing on the subcomponents of the Polity2
regime measure. As can be seen, the coefficient for Political Distance
(1.00) is positive and significant, corroborating that regime mixed
dyads do indeed have more militarized conflict than others. Yet, the
inclusion of this term has no effect on the results that concern us
here: CIEL ()0.85) is now even more robust, and the coefficient for
DemocracyL (0.03) is above zero.7 Model 4 replaces the continuous
democracy measure with the standard binary one (Polity2 \> 6), as
suggested by Russett (2010:201), citing Bayer and Bernhard (2010). As
can be observed, the coefficient for CIEL ()0.83) remains negative and
highly significant, while DemocracyBinary6 (0.63) is in the positive
(wrong) direction. As discussed above, analyses of fatal dispute onsets
with the far stricter binary measure for democracy (Polity = 10), put
forward by Dafoe (2011) in response to Mousseau (2009), yields perfect
prediction (as does the prior binary measure Both States CIE), causing
quasi-complete separation and inconclusive results. Therefore, Model 5
reports the results with DemocracyBinary10 in analyses of all
militarized conflicts, not just fatal ones. As can be seen, the
coefficient for DemocracyBinary10 ()0.41), while negative, is not
significant. Model 6 reports the results in analyses of fatal disputes
with DemocracyL squared (after adding 10), which implies that the
likelihood of conflict decreases more quickly toward the high values of
DemocracyL. As can be seen, [[the coefficient]{.mark} for DemocracyL 2
[is]{.mark} at [zero]{.mark}, further corroborating that [even very high
levels of democracy do not]{.mark} appear to [cause peace]{.mark} in
analyses of fatal disputes, [once consideration is]{.mark} [given
to]{.mark} contractintensive [economy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Models 3, 4,
and 6, which include Political Distance, were repeated (but unreported
to save space) with analyses of all militarized interstate disputes,
with the democracy coefficients close to zero in every case. Therefore,
the conclusions reached by Mousseau (2009) are corroborated even with
the most stringent measures of democracy, consideration of institutional
distance, and across all specifications: [[The **democratic peace
appears spurious**]{.mark}, [with]{.mark} contract-intensive [economy
being]{.mark} [the more likely explanation]{.mark} [for]{.mark} both
[democracy and the democratic peace]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### Democracy\-\--Ext\-\--Interference Now

#### Interference [now]{.underline} -- China's targeting [other countries too]{.underline} -- Cambodia and the US

That's a foreign policy issue that Washington should address for its own
sake. But the fact [that Beijing is using Russian-style political
interference]{.underline} tools [should prompt a full-scale]{.underline}
national security [alarm]{.underline}. The capabilities Beijing is
honing in Taiwan could do huge damage if applied to the United States.
[[China is]{.underline}]{.mark} testing them on a country it knows well
but [[preparing]{.mark} for]{.underline} their [use]{.underline}
**[[around the world.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[[There's]{.underline} **[credible evidence]{.underline}**]{.mark} that
[[China is]{.underline} **[already]{.underline}**
[using]{.underline}]{.mark} [cyber [campaigns to interfere in]{.mark}
the [politics of **other**]{.mark} **foreign [countries]{.mark}**[,
as]{.mark} was [seen in Cambodia]{.mark} this year]{.underline}. [[There

American soil]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[are ramping
up]{.underline}**]{.mark} [as]{.underline} the [U.S.-China
relations]{.underline}hip continues to [worsen]{.underline}.

### Democracy\-\--Ext\-\--No Impact

#### Democracy doesn't solve war

**Taner, 2** (Binner, PhD Candidate -- Syracuse U., Alternatives:
Turkish Journal of Int'l Relations, 1(3), p. 43-44,
http://www.alternativesjournal.com/binnur.pdf)

The discussion above suggests that [the most important drawback of the
"democratic peace" theory is the essentialization of the political
regime as the only factor contributing to international peace and war.
[The 'democratic peace' theory underemphasizes, and]{.mark} most often
[neglects]{.mark}, the importance of [other domestic factors such as
political culture]{.mark},35 degree of development, [socio-economic and
military considerations]{.mark},36 the role of interest-groups and other
domestic constituencies,37 [strategic culture]{.mark}38 [among
others]{.mark} in decision-making]{.underline}. In other words, it is
easily the case that the "democratic peace theory" lacks sensitivity to
context and decisionmaking process. Although one should not dispute the
fact that domestic political structure/regime type is an important
component of any analysis of war and peace, this should be seen as only
one of domestic variables, not necessarily the variable. [Devoid of an
analysis that gives respect to a number of other factors, superficial
and [sweeping generalizations]{.mark} will [leave **many details in
decision-making unaccounted for**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}
Consequently, although "democratic peace" theory should not be discarded
entirely, current emphasis on the importance of "democracy" in
eliminating bloody conflicts in the world should not blind scholars and
policy circles alike to the fact that "democratic peace" is
theoretically and empirically overdetermined.

#### No stats for DPT

**Gowa 95** (Joanne, "Democratic States and International Disputes",
6-22, http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-194275_ITM)

Students of this issue have been very careful to make clear that whether
or not a state is democratic does not affect its overall propensity to
wage war. As they observe, [[democracies are **just as likely**]{.mark}
as are other states [to engage in war]{.mark}]{.underline}.(9) In
addition, [[no strong evidence that democracies are any less
likely]{.mark} than are other polities [to initiate war
exists]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, [[the incidence of war between
democracies is not an indicator of the war-proneness of
democracies]{.mark} in general. Instead, [the distinctive effect of
democracy on war is **limited** to cases in which both members of a pair
of states are democratic]{.mark}]{.underline}. Another finding that
emerges from this literature relates to the outbreak of militarized
interstate disputes (MIDs). Several studies find that a statistically
significant difference in the incidence of MIDs exists between members
of pairs of democratic states and members of other dyads. Charles
Gochman and Zeev Maoz categorize a dispute as an MID if (1) it involves
\"threats to use military force, displays of military force, or actual
uses of force\"; and (2) the threat or deployment of military forces is
\"explicit, overt, nonaccidental, and government sanctioned.\"(10)
Examples of MIDs include the 1898 Fashoda crisis, the 1962 Cuban missile
crisis, and the 1969 Sino-Soviet border crisis. The finding about MIDs
echoes that about wars, namely, that militarized disputes are much less
likely to occur between democracies than between members of other pairs
of states.

[[For]{.underline} **[three months]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in a
row]{.underline}** this year, [[U.S. military ships have sailed through
the]{.mark} Taiwan [Strait]{.mark}, seen [as]{.mark} **a show of
[support for Taipei and a challenge to Beijing]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.
[They are **just one aspect**]{.underline} [of]{.underline}]{.mark}
[Trump]{.underline} administration's **[[backing]{.mark} for
[Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and combined with China's more
aggressive approach to the democratic island, many analysts fear a
cross-strait crisis.

[[Trump Is **Raising**]{.mark} **the [Stakes]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[In the past nine months, U.S. ships have sailed through the Taiwan
Strait **six times**]{.underline}. [[During]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Obama]{.underline}]{.mark} administration, [[passages
were]{.underline}]{.mark} **[far [less frequent]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
at just one to three times per year. Even though the Taiwan Strait is an
international waterway, [[China is **sensitive**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[to]{.underline} the [U.S.]{.underline} military's [presence [and
considers **any**]{.mark} **[transits]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of U.S.
ships through the strait]{.underline} **["[provocative]{.mark}
actions."]{.underline}**

#### [No threat]{.underline} from arms sales -- require Congress and on hold until after trade negotiations

Meanwhile, the [Trump]{.underline} administration [is said to be
encouraging Taipei to purchase dozens of [F-16s]{.mark}, a sale
that]{.underline}, like other major arms deals, **[[would require
congress]{.mark}ional approval.]{.underline}** The last time the United
States sold these fighter jets to Taiwan was 1992. [**[If]{.underline}**
[the sale goes through, it would mark]{.underline}]{.mark} [another
[departure from]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[Obama]{.underline}]{.mark}
administration, [which declined to sell the jets]{.underline} to avoid
escalating tensions with Beijing. **[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[experts say [a sale **would be**]{.mark} **put [on
hold]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[until after]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [seals [a trade
deal]{.mark} with China]{.underline}.

#### Trump arms sales [won't crush ties]{.underline} -- they're [flat]{.underline} and [empirically denied]{.underline}

Yet [U.S. Arms Sales]{.underline} **[Flat]{.underline}**

[[While]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}
administration [[is taking]{.underline} **[more assertive
steps]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[than those of his
predecessors]{.underline}**, [[its arms sales]{.mark} to Taiwan
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} thus far **[[nothing
remarkable.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[has sold]{.underline}]{.mark} military [equipment to Taiwan
[since]{.mark} 19**[79]{.mark}**]{.underline}. That year, as President
Jimmy Carter severed formal diplomatic ties with the island and formally
recognized China, Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act, which is the
basis for Washington's relationship with Taipei and includes the
provision of arms for Taiwan's self-defense. The law does not require
the United States to defend Taiwan if China attacks, but it also doesn't
rule it out---a policy known as strategic ambiguity.

Since then, [the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [has followed]{.underline} through on [its
commitment to support the island's defenses, with Taiwan ranking as one
of the top importers]{.underline} of U.S. arms \[PDF\] in recent years.
During his first term, President Barack [[Obama signed off on]{.mark}
**two major [packages]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,
[totaling]{.underline}]{.mark} about **[[\$12
billion]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[PDF\]. President George W.
[[Bush]{.mark} approved]{.underline} **[[nine]{.mark} arms
packages]{.underline}**, [[worth]{.underline}]{.mark} approximately
**[[\$5 billion]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [during his first
term.]{.underline}

#### US/China relations [strong]{.underline} and [resilient]{.underline}

**Chen 14** -- Chen Weihua, Knight Fellow at Stanford University, World
Press Institute Fellow based at Macalester College, Deputy Editor of
China Daily USA, "Year of Cooperation Marks US, China Relations", China
Daily, 12/31,
http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/us/2014-12/31/content_19206219.htm

In particular, the two intertwined global powers of [[China and]{.mark}
the [US]{.mark} have [continue]{.mark}d [to forge]{.mark} a new paradigm
of]{.underline} \"big country [[relations\" **in**]{.mark} **the [face
of disagreement]{.mark}** and competition]{.underline}.

Teng Jianqun, a senior research fellow from the China Institute of
International Studies, said [the China-US [relations]{.mark}hip [is
**shifting into**]{.mark} **a [\"new normal\"]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a
term Xi has recently adopted to describe the current stage of China\'s
economic development.

\"**[[Despite]{.underline}]{.mark}** fierce competition and **[frequent
[setbacks]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in traditional areas such as trade and
security, [China and]{.mark} the [US]{.mark} have managed to **[avoid
conflicts]{.mark}** and seek in-depth understanding,]{.underline}\" Teng
said.

Bilateral tensions stood high at the beginning of the year following
futile efforts by Washington and its regional allies to thwart China\'s
designation of its Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), in the East
China Sea.

To prevent China from launching a parallel in the disputed South China
Sea, the US had thrown intensive objections in the first half of the
year, questioning China\'s territorial legitimacy in relevant waters. On
the other hand, Washington avidly endorsed hardline claims by Manila and
Hanoi, further interfering in the disputes by calling for international
arbitration and a \"voluntary freeze\" of provocative actions.

\"In terms of South China Sea, the US is no longer satisfied with simply
'waving flags\' at the backstage, instead it is intervening with a
purpose of creating regulations to its own advantage,\" said Wu Xinbo,
executive dean of Institute of International Studies with Fudan
University in Shanghai.

[Hostility regarding [**maritime differences** was evident]{.mark}
during high-level visits]{.underline} to Beijing by US Secretary of
State John Kerry in February, followed by then Defense Chief Chuck Hagel
two months later.

During his visit to Japan in April, President Barack Obama for the first
time clearly stated that the US security treaty with Japan covers
China\'s Diaoyu Islands, manifesting Washington\'s increasing
determination to back up Tokyo\'s contested stance.

A column published in the December 6th-12th edition of The Economist
said China\'s territorial disputes are largely zero-sum, as the
country\'s aspiration for regional leadership challenges the US naval
supremacy in the Western Pacific.

\"Little so far suggests that any American leader would be willing to
lose,\" it said.

However, Cheng Li, director of the John L. Thornton China Center of the
Brookings Institution, said China\'s adjustment in foreign policy has
demonstrated a growing maturity, although the disputes will not go away.

\"The wisdom of leaders, the growing interaction among nations will help
make the views more mature, and leaders will get a better understanding
of the framework of China-US relations,\" Cheng said.

[[Another clashing area lay in **cyber security**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
In May, the US announced an indictment against five Chinese military
officers on allegations of cyber theft. Beijing demanded the US to
withdraw the \"purely groundless\" indictment and suspended work on a
joint cyber security work group.

Cheng urged the two countries to find a way out of the cyber security
issue and resume dialogue, \"the early the better\".

\"This is a totally new area that is characterized by the fact that
whoever launches preemptive strike gains huge advantage. It is hard to
know where the threat comes from, it could be just a lone wolf, and the
consequences of cyber attack is unimaginable,\" he said.

[**[Despite]{.mark} sharp public [disagreements]{.mark}**[, the]{.mark}
two [sides]{.mark} have [still]{.mark} managed to **[advance]{.mark}
substantive [cooperation]{.mark}**. The situation started to \"take a
clear turn for the better\" in July [after the]{.mark} sixth round of
the China-US Strategic and Economic [Dialogue reaffirmed joint
efforts]{.mark} in boosting exchanges and tackling
problems]{.underline}.

In November during the convention of the 2014 Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC), Xi took the \"home-court\" opportunity in Beijing to
renew their California cordiality with visiting US counterpart Obama
through the signing of landmark pacts on visa extension and climate
change.

Observers said the leaders of the two states might better understand
each other through personal communication so as to minimize suspicion
and miscalculation, and finalize cooperative deals.

\"As the world\'s two largest greenhouse gas emitters, [[China
and]{.mark} the US [declaring]{.mark}]{.underline} their [post-2020
[reduction targets]{.mark}]{.underline} have injected 'adrenalin\' to
next year\'s Paris Climate Convention Conference, where a binding global
agreement will be adopted,\" said Wu, the Fudan University professor.

\"[We have [also]{.mark} seen [efforts]{.mark} from both sides [to
simplify visa application, fight]{.mark} against [terrorism]{.mark} and
corruption [and advance]{.mark} investment [treaty
negotiations]{.mark}]{.underline},\" he added.

[[Breakthroughs also took place in the military sphere]{.mark}, which is
often marred by strong mistrust]{.underline}. In July, China for the
first time participated in the US-led Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) naval
exercise. Last year, the two defense authorities also established a
mutual notification mechanism for major military activities and a
standard of behavior for air and sea safety.

<https://www.cfr.org/article/us-military-support-taiwan-whats-changed-under-trump>

The [[clouds over Taiwan]{.underline} **[have grown
darker]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in recent months]{.underline}. In
January, Chinese President [[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping [[said
Taiwan **must be unified**]{.underline}]{.mark} with the mainland [and
urged Taipei to embrace the 1992 Consensus. It states that there is only
"one China" and **Taiwan belongs to it**]{.underline} but allows
different interpretations of which is the governing entity.
[China]{.underline} **["will not rule out the use of
force"]{.underline}** against foreign intervention, [Xi said. [Tsai
reiterated]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[her]{.underline}
[government]{.underline} **[will never]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[accept]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the "one country, two systems" model
and defended]{.underline} the [democratic]{.underline} island's
[sovereignty]{.underline}.

The **[[worrisome]{.underline}]{.mark}** [China-Taiwan [tensions come
as]{.mark} the [U.S.-China relations]{.mark}hip has
**[deteriorated]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [with the
two]{.underline}]{.mark} [**rivals** engaged [in]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[major]{.mark} [disputes]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[over]{.underline}
[trade]{.underline}]{.mark} [and [technology and]{.mark} **jostling for
power**]{.underline} [in [the]{.mark} western [Pacific.
During]{.mark}]{.underline} this week's North Atlantic Treaty
Organization ([[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark})
[[meetings]{.underline}]{.mark} in Washington, [threats from
[China]{.mark}]{.underline} reportedly [[featured]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[more [prominently]{.mark} than ever before]{.underline}**.

[Experts say]{.underline} **[[all]{.mark} of these
[factors]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[are]{.underline} **[increasing the
risk of a]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[cross-strait
[crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}**. ["The status quo is]{.underline}
admittedly **[imperfect]{.underline}**," [wrote]{.underline} CFR
President Richard N. [Haass]{.underline}, "but it is far less imperfect
than what would follow unilateral actions and attempts to resolve a
situation that doesn't lend itself to a neat solution."

#### Ending arms sales doesn't solve relations - Chinese leadership and territorial aspirations mean new issues will arise

**Roy '15** (Denny Roy, a Senior Fellow at the East - West Center,
6-23-15, "Trading away Taiwan is no bargain for the USA,"
<http://csis.org/files/publication/Pac1537.pdf>)

[[Glaser]{.underline}'s]{.mark} case has other weaknesses. He
[[assumes]{.mark} that the US [abandonment]{.mark} of Taiwan [would
"dramatically improve"]{.mark} US - [China
relations]{.mark}]{.underline}, and that "China can be very secure with
the United States maintaining its alliances and forward deployment" as
long as Taiwan is no longer in play. [This is [believable only
if]{.mark} we posit that [Beijing has no]{.mark} [aspirations
for]{.mark} regional [leadership]{.mark} or revisions of the current
order [beyond]{.mark} gaining control over [Taiwan]{.mark}, both now and
in the future]{.underline}. The "grand bargain" idea probably resonates
less with Beijing than Washington . From Beijing 's point of view, this
would be asking it to trade something it believe s it already own s for
something else it believe s it already own s . If they did agree, how
the "bargain" would be operationalized is unclear. What would it mean
for China to "officially accept" US alliances and military bases in the
Asia - Pacific? This would seem to require Beijing to renounce its
proudly "principled" opposition to any country having "Cold War era"
alliances and foreign bases. At the same time, [[it is easy to foresee
China continuing]{.underline}]{.mark} its pre - bargain activities
([military [buildup]{.mark}, maneuvers [with Russia]{.mark}, [naval
patrols in]{.mark} the **[E]{.mark}**ast [and]{.mark} **[S]{.mark}**outh
**[C]{.mark}**hina **[S]{.mark}**ea, etc.) [while claiming]{.mark} these
were [not attempts to drive]{.mark} [US]{.mark} influence [out]{.mark}
of the region]{.underline}. Glaser recognizes that [Chinese
[leaders]{.mark} may [intend to push out]{.mark} their [US]{.mark}
rival]{.underline}. He argues his proposal would answer the question of
whether this is Beijing's plan. If Beijing accept s the proposal, it
would indicate th at China has limited aims and can tolerate continued
US regional hegemony. If not, Ch ina intends to usurp that role from the
United States. [If we now recognize that expelling US strategic
leadership may be Beijing's intention, unilaterally [assisting]{.mark}
the [Chinese by abandoning Taiwan is]{.mark} [not]{.mark} the most
[sensible]{.mark} policy if the US hopes to retain its accustomed
role]{.underline}. The timing of Glaser's proposal is particularly bad
given that [[Xi]{.mark} Jinping's government seems to [represent]{.mark}
a [shift toward]{.mark} a [more assertive Chinese]{.mark}
**[fo]{.mark}**reign **[po]{.mark}**licy that has grown [impatient
with]{.mark} waiting for the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates to
decline on its own]{.underline}.

### IL\-\--Ext\-\--Alt Causes\-\--A2: Arms Sales Key

#### No solvency -- ending sales [creates new issues]{.underline} and [US backlash]{.underline} -- both upset China -- also ignore broader debates on unification in Taiwan AND China

**Rigger 11** (Shelley Rigger, the Brown Professor and chair of
political science at Davidson College, 11-11, "Why Giving Up Taiwan Will
Not Help Us with China," p. 4-5,
<https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/-why-giving-up-taiwan-will-not-help-us-with-china_163406442997.pdf>)

Even if it were true that Sino-American tensions could be melted away
with a single policy change in Washing- ton, the United States should
still continue to support Taiwan to maintain the credibility of its
alliances and uphold its commitment to democracy as a desirable and
feasible goal for developing nations. But, in reality, [[ending]{.mark}
US defense [assistance]{.mark} to Taipei [is unlikely to produce]{.mark}
the [salutary effects]{.mark} the critics of current US policy
anticipate]{.underline}. [[Such]{.mark} a change would]{.underline}
indeed delight Beijing; however, it would [[create new problems]{.mark}
just [as intractable]{.mark} as the old ones [but **less
familiar**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} poten- tially even **[more
challenging]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The point of departure for critics
of America's existing Taiwan policy is their shared belief that ending
security assistance to Taiwan would improve US- China relations. As
Freeman puts it, "The kind of long-term relationship of friend- ship and
cooperation China and America want with each other is incompatible with
our emotionally fraught differences over the Taiwan issue. These
differences propel mutual hostility and the sort of ruinous military
rivalry between the two countries that has already begun. We are coming
to a point at which we can no longer finesse our differences over
Taiwan. We must either resolve them or live with the increasingly
adverse consequences of our failure to do so." 10 As a syllogism, this
argument makes sense: Beijing believes Taiwan should be unified with the
mainland, and it views US security assistance to Taiwan as the primary
reason it is not. Because unification is a core issue for the PRC,
leaders in Beijing cannot ignore or overlook US intervention; they must
constantly challenge it. Thus, if the United States ended its security
assistance to Taiwan, the biggest irritant in US-China relations would
disappear. [In practice]{.underline}, unfortunately, [there is no
guarantee that a change in US policy toward Taiwan would]{.underline}
instantly or automatically end, or even significantly [reduce, the ten-
sions the Taiwan issue creates in Sino-American rela- tions.
[Ending]{.mark} security [assistance]{.mark} to Taiwan [would raise
expectations **in China** without removing]{.mark} the existing
[obstacles to]{.mark} peaceful [unification]{.mark}. It likely would
provoke panic in Taiwan, but [it would not make]{.mark} the
[Taiwan]{.mark}ese people any more [enthusiastic]{.mark} about
unification.]{.underline} On the contrary, [the [more vulnerable]{.mark}
and threatened the [Taiwan]{.mark}ese people [felt]{.mark}, the
[harder]{.mark} it would be for them [to consider China]{.mark}'s
overtures [rationally]{.mark}]{.underline}. For decades, [the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [has
[justified]{.mark} arms [sales]{.mark} to Taiwan [on]{.mark} the
[grounds]{.mark} that [Taipei can negotiate]{.mark} with Beijing [more
effectively from]{.mark} a position of [strength]{.mark} than of
weakness]{.underline}. It is easy to dismiss this logic as a rational-
ization, but as Randall Schriver said, "In what other instance involving
a negotiation is the weaker party bet- ter off? . . . Historically, what
you find is where there is equal power---or, at least, credible
deterrent power---you get better outcomes." Neither Beijing nor Taipei
is well served by a negotiating process that leads to a bad deal,
including one Taiwanese citizens cannot accept. Success- fully
pressuring Taiwan's negotiators into accepting a deal might seem like a
victory for Beijing, but [[if Taiwan's]{.mark} domestic [politics make
it impossible to implement]{.mark} the deal, the [long-term]{.mark}
result [might be worse]{.mark} than no deal at all. Ending US defense
assistance to Taiwan]{.underline}---whether by repealing the Tai- wan
Relations Act or by simply declining to provide defensive equipment to
Tai- wan's armed forces---[would not "ripen" Taiwan for peaceful
unification or obvi- ate the rationale the United States has
historically followed regarding Taiwan. [It would]{.mark}]{.underline},
however, [[intensify]{.mark} the [debate]{.mark} over Taiwan policy
[within]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates. [Taiwan still has many US friends and
supporters]{.underline}, and many foreign policy experts would question
a decision to change course. The policy changes Gilley, Glaser, Freeman,
and Owens recommend would stimulate a debate over China policy at a time
when negative attitudes toward the PRC already are on the rise. [**[The
last thing]{.mark} Sino-American [relations need]{.mark}** is an
acrimonious, politically charged debate in Washington over policy toward
China and Taiwan]{.underline}. In sum, changing America's Taiwan policy
could easily induce a poisonous turn in the domestic politics of US
China policy without making peaceful unification easier.

### IL\-\--Ext\-\--Resiliency

#### [High-level political commitments]{.underline} ensure strength

**Hammand 15** (Andrew, Associate at the Centre for International
Affairs, Diplomacy and Strategy at the London School of Economics and a
Former UK Government Special Adviser, \"US-Beijing Links Relatively
Upbeat,\" 2/4,
<http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2015/02/04/2003610759>)

Yet, [**[despite]{.mark} the [irritation]{.mark}** of some in Beijing
toward these events, [US-China relations remain on]{.mark} at least
[a]{.mark} **modest [upswing]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This was symbolized
during Obama's visit to China in November last year, when he and Chinese
President Xi Jinping (習近平) showed international leadership by
announcing a bilateral climate change agreement that could help catalyze
a new global treaty later this year. Moreover, yesterday, on the same
day that Obama was to see the Dalai Lama, top US and Chinese military
officials were to meet at the Pentagon for Defense Policy Coordination
Talks, addressing confidence-building measures including joint training
exercises and exchange programs. **[[While]{.mark} fragility and
[disagreements remain]{.mark} in bilateral relations]{.underline}**,
**[with potential setbacks on the horizon]{.underline}**, [[the
outlook]{.mark} for this year [is]{.mark} **relatively
[positive]{.mark}**. There are multiple reasons for this from the
vantage points of Washington and Beijing. While [China]{.mark} continues
to build its international influence, it [has]{.mark} recently [softened
its stance on]{.mark} some [foreign policy]{.mark} issues.]{.underline}
[In part, [this reflects]{.mark} the influence and **[changed
calculations of Xi]{.mark}**, now two years into his presidency, who has
gradually extended his writ, including over the military. In the US
context, he has called for a "new type of great power relationship" to
avoid any sense of the inevitability of conflict between Beijing and
Washington. While this new idea is an audacious goal that is unlikely to
be fully realized, it reflects his desire [to]{.mark} try to
**[take]{.mark} unnecessary [confrontation off the
table]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To this end, while assertiveness will not
disappear from Chinese policy, partly because of domestic public
appetite for it, there has recently been reversion to greater diplomacy
and defusing of tension. One example was the decision of the Chinese
Ministry of Defense in December last year to hold an unprecedented
meeting between the two nations' defense policy planning staffs.
Moreover, a party from Beijing visited Washington last fall to discuss
cybersecurity issues --- a regular bilateral irritant. While Washington
does not necessarily believe that this conciliatory behavior will last,
it does appear to represent a break with the first 18 months of Xi's
presidency, when Beijing's foreign and military positions and rhetoric
were more pugnacious. This was showcased by the near-collision between a
Chinese warship and the USS Cowpens in the South China Sea in December
2013, which then-US secretary of defense Chuck Hagel blamed on
"incendiary" and "irresponsible" Chinese behavior, and in August last
year, when a Chinese fighter jet carried out what the Pentagon termed a
"dangerous intercept" of a US surveillance aircraft, again over the
South China Sea. From Washington's standpoint, this warming in relations
is to be welcomed, especially when crises in the Middle East and Ukraine
will continue to receive the bulk of high-level US attention and
considerable military resources this year. While the US' long-term pivot
towards Asia-Pacific will continue, [[Obama is **keen to avoid** a major
spike in]{.mark} bilateral [tensions.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Washington
will]{.mark} thus seek to [avoid]{.mark} too many clear ["red
lines"]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region to provide greater latitude
and to encourage Beijing to the view that the US is not trying to
contain a rising China. Nevertheless, even in this relatively
cooperative context, there are still potential icebergs on the horizon
that could see a freeze in relations[.]{.underline} First, China's
animus toward US sea and air maneuvers near its borders is growing. As
with the naval and air incidents near the South China Sea, further
(potentially more serious) spats cannot be ruled out this year. However,
perhaps the biggest source of risk lies in relation to Japan, where
nationalist Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was re-elected in a
landslide victory in December last year. A key part of his conservative
agenda of emphasizing Japanese pride in its past is overturning the
remaining legal and political underpinning of the nation's post-war
pacifist security identity, so that it can become more actively engaged
internationally. This includes building up military capabilities. This
is perceived as a threat in Beijing, exacerbated by Washington's close
security ties with Tokyo. And while no country desires conflict, serious
misjudgement by one or more sides cannot be ruled out. Taken overall,
the short-term outlook for China-US relations is relatively positive,
despite regular bilateral irritants. [Significant downside risks remain,
but]{.underline} both [[Beijing]{.mark} and China [appear]{.mark} to
have [resolved to manage tensions]{.mark}]{.underline} better, **[[while
cooperating more in areas, such as climate change, where there
are]{.mark} potentially [significant]{.mark} overlapping
[interests]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

### IL\-\--Ext\-\--Resiliency\-\--A2: Taiwan Different

#### Relations resilient -- empirics -- our evidence is specific to Taiwan arms sales

**Straits Times** **11** (Taiwan\'s Fate: China, US Won\'t Rock the
Boat, Lexis, 6/3)

For years, Washington sought to uphold two objectives: deter the Chinese
use of force against Taiwan, while at the same time hold out for a
peaceful resolution of the Taiwan question. Now, however, the focus has
tilted to the latter, given Washington\'s reluctance to face another
Taiwan Strait crisis scenario. Mr Robert Sutter, a George Washington
University professor and career civil servant, argues that Mr Obama\'s
support for Taiwan\'s China policy \'fails to hide the reduced overall
US backing for Taiwan, especially for actions that risk complicating
US-China relations for the sake of shoring up support for Taiwan\'. [The
[resilience of Sino-American understanding over Taiwan
is]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[evident]{.mark} if one examines their
interactions following previous US arms sales to Taiwan. In
1992]{.underline}, the President George H.W. [[Bush
sold]{.underline}]{.mark} 150 [[F-16s]{.mark} to Taiwan]{.underline}.
[[Beijing protested]{.mark}]{.underline} vehemently,
[[but]{.underline}]{.mark} eventually [[relations were restored]{.mark}
to normal]{.underline}. [Last year, the [US sold]{.mark}]{.underline} a
US \$6.4 billion (S \$7.9 billion) [[arms]{.underline}]{.mark} package
[to Taiwan. [Beijing protested]{.mark} and broke off
military-to-military contacts]{.underline}. [[Relations were
restored]{.underline}]{.mark} earlier [this year]{.underline}, when Mr
Gates visited Beijing. This was followed by a visit to the US by General
Chen Bingde, the People\'s Liberation Army\'s chief of general staff.

1.1.3 Engineered pandemics

For most of human history, natural pandemics have posed the greatest
risk of mass global fatalities.37 However, [there are some reasons to
believe that natural [pandemics are **very unlikely** to cause]{.mark}
human [extinction]{.mark}. Analysis of the]{.underline} International
Union for Conservation of Nature [(IUCN) red list database has shown
that [of the]{.mark} 833 [recorded]{.mark} plant and animal species
[extinctions]{.mark} known to have occurred since 1500, [less than
4%]{.mark} (31 species) [were ascribed to]{.mark} infectious
[disease]{.mark}]{.underline}.38 [[None]{.mark} of the mammals and
amphibians on this list [were globally dispersed, and other
factors]{.mark} aside from infectious disease [also contributed]{.mark}
to their extinction. It therefore seems that [our]{.mark} own
[species]{.mark}, which is [**very numerous**, **globally dispersed**,
and **capable of a**]{.mark} **rational [response]{.mark}** to problems,
[is very unlikely to be killed off]{.mark} by a natural
pandemic]{.underline}. One underlying explanation for this is that
[[highly lethal pathogens]{.mark} can [kill]{.mark} their hosts [before
they]{.mark} have a chance to [spread, so there is]{.mark} a [selective
pressure]{.mark} for pathogens [not to be]{.mark} highly
[lethal]{.mark}. Therefore, [pathogens]{.mark} are likely to
[co-evolve]{.mark} with their hosts [rather than kill all]{.mark}
possible [hosts]{.mark}]{.underline}.39

The [[U.S. won commitments from **25**]{.mark} **countries** and the
**W**]{.underline}orld **[H]{.underline}**ealth
**[O]{.underline}**rganization [[to]{.mark} work together on systems to
**better [detect and combat]{.mark} outbreaks** of infectious
[diseases]{.mark} such as H7N9]{.underline} avian flu [and
Ebola]{.underline} virus. The [[Obama]{.underline}]{.mark}
administration [[plans to spend **\$40 million**]{.mark} **in 10
countries**]{.underline} this year [[to upgrade lab]{.mark}oratories
[and communications]{.mark} networks [so outbreaks can be
controlled]{.mark} **more [quickly]{.mark}**]{.underline}, Thomas
Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
said today in an interview. President Barack [[Obama will seek another
\$45 million]{.mark} next year]{.underline} to expand the program.
Infectious diseases account for about 1 in 4 deaths worldwide, according
to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. While diseases such as Ebola
and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome haven't posed a threat to the
U.S., lapses in other countries may allow an outbreak to spread rapidly,
Frieden said. "No country can protect itself solely within its borders,"
Frieden said. "[We're all only as safe as the weakest link]{.underline}
out there. [[This]{.mark} is an effort to essentially [make]{.mark}
the]{.underline} **[U.S. safer and make [the world
safer]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [to improve]{.underline}]{.mark}
[countries' [capacity to]{.mark} **better [find, stop and
prevent]{.mark} health [threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}." Frieden and
Kathleen Sebelius, the U.S. health secretary, held a videoconference
today with the partners in the effort. While no other country made a
specific financial commitment today, Frieden said, [all]{.underline} the
[[nations]{.mark} at the conference including China, Russia, France and
the U.K. [agreed to "**accelerate progress**]{.mark} and address not
just the health sector but include security in health [in **new
ways**]{.mark}."]{.underline} First Consensus "**[[For the first
time]{.underline}]{.mark}**, really, [[we have]{.mark} a
[consensus]{.mark} on not only what are the threats, but what do we have
to do to address them,"]{.underline} he said. [As an
example,]{.underline} Frieden said [Turkey]{.underline}'s government
[agreed to host a WHO office to respond to outbreaks in its
region.]{.underline} [The agreement will]{.underline} also [target
**emerging infections** such as]{.underline} **[M]{.underline}**iddle
**[E]{.underline}**ast **[R]{.underline}**espiratory
**[S]{.underline}**yndrome. The 10 countries in line for the U.S.
investment, which will be funded by the CDC and the Department of
Defense, weren't identified. [The [CDC plans to build on test
projects]{.mark}]{.underline} last year in Uganda and Vietnam, [[where
the agency helped]{.underline}]{.mark} the two [nations' health
officials [improve systems to detect]{.mark} and combat outbreaks
of]{.underline} dangerous pathogens that include drug-resistant
[tuberculosis, Ebola]{.underline} virus [and]{.underline} exotic
[flu]{.underline} strains. In Uganda, [CDC officials helped the
country's Ministry of Health upgrade laboratories]{.underline} where
tissue samples would be tested in the event of an outbreak, [and
developed a system for local doctors to report cases of
illness]{.underline} by text message, according to an article published
in the CDC's journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. [[Uganda now
is able to **quickly** transport]{.mark} tissue [samples]{.mark} from
rural outbreaks to a high-security lab]{.underline} in the capital,
Kampala, by motorcycle courier and overnight mail, Frieden said. A
mobile phone network-connected printer then texts lab results back to
rural hospitals, he said. "[Ultimately every country in the world should
have this kind of system," Frieden said. **The \$[40 million]{.mark}, he
said, "[is certainly]{.mark} enough to make [a good
start]{.mark}."**]{.underline}

<http://www.quora.com/Why-dont-diseases-completely-wipe-out-species>

But [mostly [diseases **don\'t drive**]{.mark} **species
[extinct]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There are several reasons for that. For
one, [the most dangerous diseases are those that spread from one
individual to another. If the disease is highly lethal, then the
population drops, and it becomes **less likely that individuals will
contact each other**]{.underline} during the infectious phase.
**[[Highly contagious]{.mark} [diseases]{.mark} tend to [burn]{.mark}
themselves [out]{.mark}]{.underline}** that way. Probably [the main
reason is variation. Within the host and the pathogen
population]{.underline} there will be a wide range of variants.
[[Some]{.mark} hosts [may be naturally resistant]{.mark}. Some
pathogens]{.underline} will be [less virulent]{.underline}. And [either
alone or in combination, **[you end up with infected]{.mark} individuals
[who survive]{.mark}**. We see this in HIV]{.underline}, for example.
[There is a small fraction]{.underline} of humans who are [naturally
resistant or]{.underline} [altogether immune]{.underline} to HIV, either
because of their CCR5 allele or their MHC Class I type. [And there are
[a handful]{.mark} of people who were infected]{.underline} with
defective versions of HIV [**that [didn\'t progress]{.mark}** to
disease]{.underline}. [We can see]{.underline} indications of
[this]{.underline} sort of thing happening [in the past, because our
genomes contain **many instances** of pathogen [resistance]{.mark} genes
that have [spread through the]{.mark} whole
[population]{.mark}.]{.underline} Those all started off as rare
mutations that conferred a strong selection advantage to the carriers,
meaning that the specific infectious diseases were serious threats to
the species.

That leaves pandemics and cobalt bombs, which will get a longer
discussion. [While there is little published work on [human
extinction]{.mark} risk [from pandemics]{.mark}, it seems that **it
[would be extremely challenging]{.mark} for any
pandemic**]{.underline}---[whether **natural or**]{.underline}
man[made]{.underline}---[to leave the people in a specially constructed
refuge as the **sole survivors**]{.underline}. In his introductory book
on pandemics ([Doherty]{.underline}, 2013, p. 197) [argues]{.underline}:
"[**[No pandemic is likely to wipe out]{.mark} the [human
s]{.mark}pecies.** [Even without]{.mark} the protection provided by
[modern science, we survived]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[smallpox, TB,
and]{.mark} the [plagues]{.mark} of recorded history.]{.underline}** Way
[back [when human numbers were **very small**]{.mark}, infections may
have been responsible for some]{.underline} of the **[genetic
bottlenecks]{.underline}** inferred from evolutionary analysis, [but
there is **no formal proof**]{.underline} of this." [Though some
[authors]{.mark} have **vividly [described worst-case
scenarios]{.mark}**]{.underline} for engineered pandemics (e.g. Rees,
2003 and Posner, 2004; and Myhrvold, 2013), [[it would take a **special
effort** to infect]{.mark} people in [**highly isolated locations**,
especially]{.mark} the [100+]{.mark} **"largely [uncontacted"
peoples]{.mark} who prefer to be left alone.**]{.underline} This is not
to say it would be impossible. A madman intent on annihilating all human
life could use cropduster-style delivery systems, flying over isolated
peoples and infecting them. Or perhaps a pandemic could be engineered to
be delivered through animal or environmental vectors that would reach
all of these people

A [new]{.underline} set of journal [articles related to]{.underline} the
10th anniversary of the [[SARS]{.underline}]{.mark} epidemic in 2003
[says the episode **[did much to boost recognition]{.mark}** of the need
for coordinated]{.underline} international and national [responses
to]{.underline} emerging infectious [diseases]{.underline}. The articles
and commentaries in Emerging Infectious Diseases reflect on the effects
of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), which arose in China in
late 2002 and spread to more than 30 countries in early 2003, sickening
about 8,000 people and killing around 800. The outbreak was first
publicized by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Mar 12, 2003. Among
the reports is one describing two new SARS-like coronaviruses---close
relatives of the SARS coronavirus---found in bats in China. The new
viruses are more distant relatives of the novel human coronavirus that
has caused illnesses in 17 people, with 11 deaths, in the past year. All
of the cases had connections to the Middle East.
[Publication]{.underline} of the articles [comes as the world is
contending with still another emerging pathogen,]{.underline} the novel
[H7N9 influenza]{.underline} virus in China, which has infected at least
64 people and killed 14 in recent weeks. Surveillance and response In a
\"synopsis\" piece, a team led by Christopher R. [Braden]{.underline},
MD, of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [reports
on **progress** in global surveillance and response
capacity]{.underline} in the 10 years since SARS emerged. [They review
the milestones of the epidemic,]{.underline} from its silent emergence
in southern China in November 2002 to its spread to Hong Kong and,
boosted by a \"superspreader,\" from there to many other countries. They
[say the [SARS]{.mark} epidemic **[powerfully stimulated international
cooperation]{.mark}** to fight emerging diseases.]{.underline} \"Perhaps
[the **[most important legacy]{.mark}** of SARS [is]{.mark} the
[recognition of the critical need for]{.mark} a [multilateral
response]{.mark}, led by WHO]{.underline}, in the event of a rapidly
moving but ultimately containable global epidemic,\" they write. \"[The
[central role of WHO]{.mark}]{.underline} [in coordinating the
laboratory network]{.underline} that identified the etiologic agent and
shared reagents, the [epidemiology network]{.underline} that
characterized the spread and identified the most effective control
measures, [and the policy]{.underline} and communications network that
incorporated rapidly changing knowledge into measured travel advisories
[[was **critical for**]{.mark} **the [control]{.mark} of the epidemic
and a credit to WHO.**\"]{.underline} The [[SARS]{.underline}]{.mark}
epidemic dramatically reduced global travel and business, showing how
disruptive a new pathogen could be, Braden and colleagues observe. Those
effects [[stimulated]{.mark} pandemic flu [planning]{.mark} and
surveillance, a greater [focus on]{.mark} global [health]{.mark}
security, and improved [laboratory and surveillance networks.
**Further**]{.mark}, the [episode **spurred efforts**]{.mark} to update
the International Health Regulations, [which had not been revised since
1969]{.mark}]{.underline}, the article says. The regulations took effect
in 2007. However, fewer than 20% of the 194 WHO countries that accepted
the regulations had complied with their core requirements by the June
2012 deadline, according to Braden and colleagues. **[[Another
effect]{.underline}]{.mark}** of SARS [[was]{.mark} to spur the
establishment of [new]{.mark} national public health [agencies]{.mark}
in Canada]{.underline} (the Public Health Agency of Canada, or PHAC)
[and the United Kingdom]{.underline} (the Health Protection Agency), the
authors say. In a related perspective article, a team led by Jeffrey P.
[Koplan]{.underline}, MD, MPH, of Emory University, a former CDC
director, [says the value of national public health institutes **was one
of the major lessons**]{.underline} of SARS. Koplan is joined by authors
from the PHAC and its counterparts in Hong Kong and China. They note
that more than [**[80]{.mark}** national public health [institutes are
now linked]{.mark} through the International Association of National
Public Health Institutes]{.underline}, which promotes the establishment
of new institutes and helps strengthen existing ones.

Proliferation, after all, means rapid spread. And whereas nuclear
weapons have proliferated "vertically", with existing nuclear states
adding to their existing nuclear arsenals, **[[there has not
been]{.mark} a "[horizontal]{.mark}" nuclear weapons
[prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline}** -- that is, [a fast spread of
these weapons to new nations]{.underline}. [On the
contrary]{.underline}, [nuclear [weapons]{.mark} have **[spread
slowly]{.mark}**]{.underline} across the world, [even though academics,
politicians and the media frequently discuss horizontal nuclear weapons
proliferation as if it was a matter of fact]{.underline}. **[[Reality
check]{.mark}]{.underline}** Currently, [there are only nine
states]{.underline} in the world [with nuclear weapons]{.underline}
among the UN's 193 members: the US (since 1945), Russia (since 1949),
the UK (since 1952), France (since 1960), China (since 1964), Israel
(since 1966, unofficial), India (since 1974), Pakistan (since 1998) and
North Korea (since 2006). Other [countries have dropped off the
list]{.underline}. [[South Africa]{.underline}]{.mark} joined the
nuclear club in the 1980s, but [[dismantled]{.underline}]{.mark} its
weapons in the early 1990s. [[Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine]{.mark}
i]{.underline}nherited nuclear weapons from the Soviet Union when they
became independent states after the Cold War, but they
[[transferred]{.mark} their nuclear arsenal to Russia]{.underline} in
the 1990s. In other words, only a handful of countries in Europe, Asia
and North America possess these weapons, while Africa, Australasia and
Latin America are devoid of nuclear weapons states. In fact, [[the
number]{.mark} of nuclear weapons states [has]{.mark} [actually
decreased]{.mark} ever since the 1990s]{.underline}. [And even
though]{.underline} the Pakistani nuclear weapons scientist Abdul Qadeer
Khan confirmed [the existence of a global nuclear]{.underline} [black
market]{.underline} which purportedly provided nuclear technology,
expertise, and designs to various countries, including Libya, [no
horizontal nuclear weapons proliferation has taken place.]{.underline}
[Libya]{.underline} eventually voluntarily [renounced its secret nuclear
weapons]{.underline} [efforts]{.underline} in December 2003.
[[Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, and Taiwan]{.mark} have also
[shelved]{.mark} their nuclear weapons programs]{.underline}. As of now,
there are 31 countries with nuclear power plant units in operation;
countries such as Australia, Canada, and Japan are widely believed to
have the technological sophistication to become nuclear weapons states
in relatively short amount of time should they want to -- but they have
not pursued that path. In other words, [even though there have been
opportunities]{.underline} [for]{.underline} nuclear weapons
[proliferation]{.underline} [across a range of new states,]{.underline}
**[[such]{.mark} [a development has not
materialised]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[All]{.mark} of the available
[evidence]{.mark}]{.underline}** thus
**[[unanimously]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[suggests]{.underline}]{.mark}
that [[no]{.mark} horizontal nuclear weapons [prolif]{.mark}eration has
taken place throughout the 70 years that these weapons have
existed]{.underline}. [[Claims to the contrary]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[lack basis]{.underline}]{.mark}**, whether they are [[made
for]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[political or economic
reasons]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[sheer
ignorance]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or for any other purposes.
[[Horizontal]{.mark} nuclear weapons [prolife]{.mark}ration [is
a]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[bogeyman that does not
exist]{.underline}]{.mark}**. If we are to devise sound strategies and
policies regarding nuclear weapons we have to ground them in existing
reality. Recognising that [there is no horizontal nuclear weapons
proliferation]{.underline} is a good place to start.

[But there\'s [one problem with]{.mark} this [\"nuclear domino\"]{.mark}

[[many]{.mark} have [fear]{.mark}ed [rapid]{.mark} and widespread

emergence of the first nuclear state, the United States, in 1945, and
the fifth, China, in 1964.¶ The [next 40 years gave birth to only
five]{.underline} additional [nuclear countries]{.underline}: India,
Israel, South Africa, Pakistan, and North Korea. South Africa
voluntarily disarmed in the 1990s, as did Belarus, Kazakhstan, and
Ukraine following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. [[After
Israel]{.underline} [developed]{.underline}]{.mark} a [nuclear

country is surrounded by rivals[. Nor was there even a two-country
nuclear arms race in the region]{.underline}.¶ Similarly[, it has now
been four years since [North Korea became a nuclear weapons state, yet
South Korea and Japan have **not followed suit**]{.mark}, despite the
fact that they have a latent nuclear weapons capability]{.underline} \--
access to the fissile material necessary for nuclear weapons. These
countries\' decisions to not go nuclear are largely [thanks
to]{.underline} extensive U.S. efforts to dissuade them. Both South
Korea and Japan enjoy firm and long-standing security assurances from
Washington, [including protection under the U.S.]{.underline} strategic

Cartwright is hardly alone in holding these views. Indeed, the general

these states --- South Africa --- [voluntarily [dismantled its
arsenal.]{.mark}]{.underline}

So what explains this great nuclear slowdown? Two converging trends seem
to be at work. First, [there has been an]{.underline} **[undeniable
decline]{.underline}** [in the number of states interested in
acquiring]{.underline} nuclear [weapons]{.underline}. Harald
[[Muller]{.underline} [and]{.underline}]{.mark} Andreas
[[Schmidt]{.underline}]{.mark} have [documented this]{.underline} well.
[In their]{.underline} **[[comprehensive study]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[of states with]{.underline} nuclear [weapons activities
between]{.underline} 19**[45]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
20**[05]{.underline}**, [they [find]{.mark} that]{.underline} "[[states
with nuclear weapons activities]{.mark} were]{.underline} **[always a
minority]{.underline}**, [and today they [are the]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[smallest minority]{.underline}]{.mark}** since 1945." Specifically,
in 2005 [they identified 10 [states]{.mark} as [having nuclear
weapons]{.mark} activities]{.underline} (including those with nuclear
weapons), [which [constitute]{.mark}d]{.underline} [**[less than six
percent]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} [UN]{.underline}]{.mark}
[members]{.underline}. Today the only non-nuclear weapon state (NNWS)
that might be interested in an atomic weapon is Iran.

The fact that [[states have]{.underline}]{.mark} **[by and large [been
uninterested]{.mark} in nuclear weapons]{.underline}** is somewhat
perplexing from a historic perspective. After all, what other
revolutionary military technology hasn't elicited strong interest from
most states competing in the international system?

At the same time, when one examines the properties of nuclear weapons
more closely, the lack of interest is easier to understand. [Nuclear
weapons]{.underline} have basically [served one purpose]{.underline} for
states possessing them; namely, [they]{.underline} have [deterred
others]{.underline} from challenging that state's survival and other
fundamental interests. But the [nuclear era has]{.underline} also [been
characterized by a sharp decline in warfare]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} today [fewer]{.underline} [states]{.underline}
[face]{.underline} fundamental external [threats]{.underline} to their
existence. Given the high costs of building and maintaining a nuclear
arsenal, it makes little sense to acquire nuclear weapons without such
an existential threat.

While lack of interest explains why some states have renounced nuclear
weapons despite possessing the capability to build them, the
[[difficulty]{.underline} [in building them]{.underline}]{.mark} [has
[prevented]{.mark} others [states]{.mark} [that
seek]{.mark}]{.underline} nuclear [[weapons]{.mark} from acquiring
them]{.underline}. [Despite]{.underline} the view that "[where there is
a will there's a way," and]{.underline} a strong sense that
[globalization]{.underline} has exacerbated this, the [historical record
tells]{.underline} [a]{.underline} very [different story.]{.underline}

As Jacques Hymans has pointed out, before 1970 seven countries launched
dedicated nuclear weapon programs and all seven succeeded in an average
of seven years. Since 1970, [ten states have launched dedicated nuclear
weapons [programs]{.mark} and only three]{.underline} have
[succeeded]{.underline} (the jury's still out on Iran).
[These]{.underline} three have [[take]{.underline}]{.mark}n an [average
of [17 years to succeed]{.mark}]{.underline} and [Iran]{.underline}
under the Islamic Republic [has been working towards a]{.underline}
nuclear [weapon]{.underline} capability [for]{.underline} some [three
decades.]{.underline}

Just as [[pundits]{.underline}]{.mark} have [routinely]{.underline}
[[underestimate]{.underline}d]{.mark} [the [difficulty]{.mark} of
building]{.underline} nuclear [weapons]{.underline}, so too do
[they]{.underline} [[grossly]{.mark} [overstate]{.mark} the]{.underline}
[number of [states]{.mark}]{.underline} who are [technically [capable of
building them]{.mark}]{.underline}. Both journalists and scholars
regularly cite 40 as the number of non-nuclear weapon states who are
technically capable of building them. This figure is often attributed to
the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),
Mohamed ElBaradei, who said in 2004:

"Some estimates indicate that 40 countries or more now have the know-how
to produce nuclear weapons, which means if they have the required
fissile material --- high enriched uranium or plutonium --- we are
relying primarily on the continued good intentions of these countries."

As Scott Sagan has pointed out, most of those citing ElBaradei omit the
latter part of his statement about having the required fissile material.
But this statement is crucial as only a handful of NNWS are capable of
producing or otherwise procuring fissile material, which is necessary
for a nuclear bomb.

Moreover, thanks in no small part to President Obama's focus on nuclear
security, the [global [availability of fissile material has been
declining]{.mark}]{.underline} [[as]{.mark} the U.S. and]{.underline}
its [[allies]{.underline}]{.mark} help [remove fissile material
from]{.underline} some [states while [downsizi]{.mark}ng]{.underline}
the [[stockpiles]{.underline}]{.mark} in many others. Furthermore,
compared with the Cold War era and even the 1990s, nuclear weapon
holding and [nuclear capable [states]{.mark} [are]{.mark}]{.underline}
[much [less]{.mark} [willing to sell]{.mark}]{.underline} NNWS [crucial
dual use [tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology that can be used to
indigenously produce fissile material.

Thus, [contrary to common perception]{.underline}, [[there
is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[no impeding nuclear domino about to
fall.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### [No impact]{.underline} -- prolif empirically doesn't cause war and is slow

**Walt, 12** (Stephen Walt -- Robert and Renée Belfer professor of
international relations at Harvard University, 11/30, Foreign Policy,
"The mother of all worst-case assumptions about Iran",
<http://walt.foreignpolicy.com>
/posts/2012/11/30/the_mother_of_all_worst_case_assumptions_about_iran)

Yet this \"mother of all assumptions\" is simply asserted and rarely
examined. The obvious question to ask is this: [[did]{.mark} [prior acts
of]{.mark} nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration [have]{.mark} the same
[fearsome consequences]{.mark} that Iran hawks now forecast? The answer
is [no]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, [the spread of nuclear weapons has
had]{.underline} remarkably [little impact on the]{.underline} [basic
nature of world politics]{.underline} and the ranking of major powers.
[[The main effect]{.mark} of the nuclear revolution [has been]{.mark} to
induce **[greater caution]{.mark}** in the behavior of both those who
possessed the bomb and anyone who had to deal with a nuclear-armed
adversary.]{.underline} [[Prolif]{.mark}eration [has not transformed
weak states into]{.mark} influential [global actors]{.mark}, [has not
given]{.mark} nuclear-armed [states the ability to blackmail]{.mark}
their neighbors or force them to kowtow, **[and it has not
triggered]{.mark}** far-reaching regional **[arms
races]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In short, fears that an Iranian bomb would
transform regional or global politics have been greatly exaggerated; one
might even say that they are just a lot of hooey.¶ [[Consider the
historical record]{.underline}]{.mark}.¶ Did the world turn on its axis
when the mighty Soviet Union tested its first bomb in 1949? Although
alarmist documents like NSC-68 warned of a vast increase in Soviet
influence and aggressiveness, [[Soviet nuclear
developmen]{.mark}t]{.underline} simply
[[reinforced]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[caution]{.underline}]{.mark}
that both superpowers were already displaying towards each other. The
United States already saw the USSR as an enemy, and the basic principles
of containment were already in place. NATO was being formed before the
Soviet test and Soviet dominance of Eastern Europe was already a fait
accompli. Having sole possession of the bomb hadn\'t enabled Truman to
simply dictate to Stalin, and getting the bomb didn\'t enable Stalin or
his successors to blackmail any of their neighbors or key U.S. allies.
[It certainly didn\'t lead any countries to \"reorient their political
alignment]{.underline} toward Moscow.\" Nikita Khrushchev\'s subsequent
missile rattling merely strengthened the cohesion of NATO and other
U.S.-led alliances, and we now know that much of his bluster was
intended to conceal Soviet strategic inferiority. [Having a large
nuclear arsenal didn\'t stop the anti-commnist uprisings in East
Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, or Poland, and didn\'t allow the
Soviet Union to win in Afghanistan. Nor did it prevent the USSR from
eventually collapsing entirely.¶ Did British and French acquisition of
nuclear weapons slow their decline as great powers? Not in the
slightest]{.underline}. Having the force de frappe may have made De
Gaulle feel better about French prestige and having their own deterrent
made both states less dependent on America\'s security umbrella, but it
didn\'t give either state a louder voice in world affairs or win them
new influence anywhere. And you might recall that Britain couldn\'t get
Argentina to give back the Falklands by issuing nuclear threats \-- even
though Argentina had no bomb of its own and no nuclear guarantee \--
they had to go retake the islands with conventional forces. ¶ [[Did
China\'s detonation of a bomb]{.underline}]{.mark} in 1964 suddenly
[[make them a superpower? Hardly]{.mark}.]{.underline} China remained a
minor actor on the world stage until it adopted market principles, and
[its]{.underline} rising global [influence is due to]{.underline} three
decades of economic [growth]{.underline}, [not]{.underline} a pile of
[nukes]{.underline}. And by the way, [did getting a bomb enable
Mao]{.underline} Zedong\--a cruel megalomaniac who launched the
disastrous Great Leap Forward in 1957 and the destructive Cultural
Revolution in the 1960s [\-- to start threatening and blackmailing his
neighbors? Nope.]{.underline} In fact, China\'s foreign policy behavior
after 1964 was generally quite restrained.¶ What about Israel? [[Does
Israel\'s nuclear arsenal allow it to coerce]{.mark} [its
neighbors]{.mark} or impose its will on Hezbollah or the Palestinians?
[No]{.mark}]{.underline}. Israel uses its conventional military
superiority to try to do these things, not its nuclear arsenal. Indeed,
[Israel\'s bomb didn\'t even prevent Egypt and Syria from attacking it
in]{.underline} October [1973]{.underline}, although it did help
convince them to limit their aims to regaining the territory they had
lost in 1967. It is also worth noting [that Israel\'s nuclear program
did not trigger a rapid arms race either.]{.underline} Although states
like Iraq and Libya did establish their own WMD programs after Israel
got the bomb, none of their nuclear efforts moved very rapidly or made
it across the finish line.¶ But wait, there\'s more. [The white
government in South Africa eventually produced a handful of bombs, but
nobody noticed]{.underline} and apartheid ended anyway. Then the new
government gave up its nuclear arsenal to much acclaim. If anything,
South Africa was more secure without an arsenal than it was before.¶
[W[hat about India and Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark}? India\'s
\"peaceful nuclear explosion\" in 1974 didn\'t turn it into a global
superpower, and its only real effect was to spur Pakistan \-- which was
already an avowed rival \-- to get one too. And it\'s worth noting that
[[there hasn\'t been a large-scale war]{.mark} between the two countries
[since]{.mark}]{.underline}, despite considerable grievances on both
sides and occasional skirmishes and other provocations.¶ Finally,
[[North Korea]{.underline}]{.mark} is as annoying and weird as it has
always been, but [getting nuclear weapons [didn\'t transform
it]{.mark}]{.underline} from an economic basket case into a mighty
regional power [and didn\'t make it more inclined to
misbehave]{.underline}. In fact, [what is most remarkable about North
Korea\'s nuclear program is how little impact it has had on its
neighbors.]{.underline} States like [[Japan and South Korea could go
nuclear very quickly]{.underline}]{.mark} if they wanted to, **[[but
neither has done so]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the six years since North
Korea\'s first nuclear test. ¶ In short, [both theory and history teach
us that getting a nuclear weapon has less impact on a country\'s power
and influence than many believe, and [the slow spread of nuclear weapons
has only modest effects on]{.mark} global and regional
[politics]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}
are good for deterring direct attacks on one\'s homeland, and they
[[induce]{.mark} greater [caution]{.mark} in the minds of national
leaders of all kinds. What they don\'t do is turn weak states into great
powers, they are useless as tools of blackmail, and they cost a lot of
money]{.underline}. [[They]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[lead]{.underline}]{.mark} other [[states]{.underline}]{.mark} to worry
more about one\'s intentions and [[to band together]{.underline}]{.mark}
for self-protection. For these reasons, most potential nuclear states
have concluded that getting the bomb isn\'t worth it.¶ But a few
states-and usually those who are worried about being attacked-decide to
go ahead. The good news is that when they do, it has remarkably little
impact on world affairs.

### Prolif\-\--Ext\-\--No Prolif

#### Slow proliferation doesn't open the floodgates 

**Waltz 3** (Kenneth, The Spread of Nuclear Weapons: A Debate Renewed,
2003, p. 42-43)

[Countries have to take care of their own security,]{.underline} if
countries feel insecure and believe that nuclear weapons would make them
more secure, [America's policy of opposing the spread of nuclear weapons
will not prevail.]{.underline} Any slight chance of bringing the spread
of nuclear weapons to a halt exists only if the United States
strenuously tries to achieve that end. To do so carries costs measured
in terms of other interests. The strongest way for the United States to
persuade other countries to forego nuclear weapons is to guarantee their
security. How many states' security do we want to guarantee? Wisely, we
are reluctant to make promises, but then we should not expect to decide
how other countries provide for their security. [[Some]{.mark} have
[fear]{.mark}ed that [weakening opposition to the spread of nuclear
weapons will lead numerous states to obtain them]{.mark} because it may
seem that "everyone is doing it." Why should we think that if we relax,
numerous states will begin to make nuclear weapons? [Both the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and the Soviet Union were
relaxed]{.mark} in the past, [and those effects did not
follow]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Soviet Union initially supported
China's nuclear program. The United States helped both Britain and
France to produce nuclear weapons. By 1968 the CIA had informed
President Johnson of the existence of Israeli nuclear weapons, and in
July of 1970, Richard Helms, director of the CIA, gave this information
to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. These and later disclosures
were not followed by censure of Israel or by reductions of economic
assistance. And in September of 1980, the executive branch, against the
will of the House of Representatives but with the approval of the
Senate, continued to do nuclear business with India despite its
explosion of a nuclear device and despite its unwillingness to sign the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty[. [Many more countries can make nuclear
weapons than do]{.mark}.]{.underline} One can believe that American
opposition to nuclear arming stays the deluge only by overlooking the
complications of international life. Any state has to examine many
conditions before deciding whether or not to develop nuclear weapons.
Our opposition is only one factor and is not likely to be the decisive
one. Many states feel fairly secure living with their neighbors. Why
should they want nuclear weapons? Some countries, feeling threatened,
have found security through their own strenuous efforts and through
arrangements made with others. South Korea is an outstanding example.
Many officials believe that South Korea would lose more in terms of
American support if it acquired nuclear weapons than it would gain by
having them. Further, on occasion we might slow the spread of nuclear
weapons by not opposing the nuclear weapons programs of some countries.
When we opposed Pakistan's nuclear program, we were saying that we
disapprove of countries developing nuclear weapons no matter what their
neighbors do. [[The gradual spread of nuclear weapons has not opened the
nuclear floodgates.]{.mark} Nations attend to their security in the ways
they think best.]{.underline} The fact that so many more countries can
make nuclear weapons than do says more about the hesi­tation of countries
to enter the nuclear military business than about the effectiveness of
American nonproliferation policy. [We should suit our policy to
individual cases,]{.underline} sometimes bringing pressure against a
country moving toward nuclear weapons capability and sometimes quietly
acquiescing: No one policy is right in all cases. We should ask what the
inter­ests of other countries require before putting pressure on them.
Some countries are likely to suffer more in cost and pain if they remain
conventional states than if they become nuclear ones. [The measured
spread of nuclear weapons does not run against our interests and can
increase the security of some states]{.underline} at a price they can
afford to pay.

[Fear of [nuclear]{.mark} weapons is rational, but its extension to
[terrorism has been]{.mark} a vehicle for [**fear-mongering**]{.mark}
that is **[unjustified]{.mark} by available data**.]{.underline} The
[debate on nuclear terrorism tends to distract from]{.underline} events
that raise the risk of [nuclear [war]{.mark}, the [consequences]{.mark}
of which would **[far exceed]{.mark} the [results]{.mark} of terrorist

risk is real. The [Cuban Missile Crisis and other

Two years after the raid on Osama bin Laden's hideaway, [terrorism
alarmists remain in peak]{.underline} form [explaining]{.underline} that
[although al-Qaeda has been weakened it]{.underline} [still]{.underline}
manages to [present a grave threat.]{.underline} Various well-honed
techniques are applied to support this contention. One is to espy and
assess various "[[linkages]{.underline}]{.mark}" or "connections"
[of]{.underline} "[ties]{.underline}" or "threads"
[[between]{.underline}]{.mark} and among a range of
[disparate]{.underline} terrorists or [terrorist
[groups]{.mark}]{.underline}, most of which
[[appear]{.underline}]{.mark} rather **[gossamer]{.underline}** [and
of]{.underline} [only [limited]{.mark} consequence on closer
examination]{.underline}. [Another]{.underline} is to **[exaggerate the
importance and effectiveness]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} the
"[affiliated groups]{.underline}" linked to al-Qaeda central. In
particular, alarmists point to the al-Qaeda affiliate in chaotic Yemen,
ominously hailing it as the "deadliest" and the "most aggressive" of
these and a "major threat." Yet its [chief efforts at international
[terrorism]{.mark}]{.underline} have **[failed abysmally]{.underline}**:
[an underwear bomb and laser printer bombs]{.underline} on cargo planes.
[With that track record]{.underline}, [the group]{.underline} may pose a
problem or concern, but it **[[scarcely presents a]{.mark} ["major
threat"]{.mark}]{.underline}** outside of war zones. More generally,
"**[al-Qaeda is its own worst enemy]{.underline}**," [as]{.underline}
Robert [Grenier]{.underline}, a [former top CIA counterterrorism
official]{.underline}, [notes]{.underline}. "[Where they]{.underline}
have [succeeded initially]{.underline}, [they]{.underline} very [quickly
discredit themselves]{.underline}." [Any terrorist threat]{.underline}
with[in]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [developed world
seems]{.underline} even [less impressive]{.underline}. The
[Boston]{.underline} [terrorists]{.underline} of 2013 were the first in
the United States since 9/11 in which Islamist terrorists actually [were
able to]{.underline} assemble and [detonate bombs]{.underline} \--
[albeit]{.underline} **[very primitive ones]{.underline}**. But [except
for that]{.underline}, [they do not seem]{.underline} to have been [more
competent than]{.underline} most of [their predecessors.]{.underline}
Amazingly, [they]{.underline} apparently [thought they could somehow get
away with their deed]{.underline} even though they chose to set their
bombs off at the most-photographed spot on the planet at the time.
Moreover, [they had no coherent plan of escape]{.underline}
[and]{.underline}, as commonly found, [no ability to explain how killing
a few random people would advance their cause.]{.underline} While the
scope of the tragedy in Boston should not be minimized, it should also
be noted that [if the terrorists' aim was to kill a large number of
people]{.underline}, [the]{.underline}ir **[bombs failed
miserably]{.underline}**. As recent cases in Colorado and Connecticut
sadly demonstrate, far more fatalities have been inflicted by gunmen.
[Before Boston]{.underline}, some [[16 people]{.underline} [had been
killed]{.underline}]{.mark} [by]{.underline} Islamist
[[terrorists]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the United States]{.underline} in
the years [since 2001]{.underline}, and all of these were murdered by
people who were essentially acting alone. By contrast, [[in
the]{.underline}]{.mark} 19**[[70s]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [organized
[terrorists]{.mark}]{.underline} inflicted hundreds of attacks, mostly
bombings, in the United States, [[kill]{.underline}]{.mark}ing
[[72]{.underline}]{.mark}. As concern about organized attacks has
diminished, fear of "lone wolf" attacks has grown in recent years, and
one official assessment contends that "lone offenders currently present
the greatest threat." This is a reasonable observation, but those
concerned should keep in mind that, as analyst Max [Abrahms]{.underline}
has [noted]{.underline}, while [[lone wolves]{.underline}]{.mark} may be
difficult to police, they have [[carried]{.mark} [out]{.mark} only [two
of]{.mark} the [1,900]{.mark} most deadly terrorist
[attacks]{.mark}]{.underline} [over]{.underline} the last [four
decades.]{.underline} The key question, at least outside of war zones,
is not, "are we safer?" but "how safe are we?" At current rates, [[an
American's chance of becoming a victim]{.mark} of terrorism]{.underline}
in the U.S., [even with 9/11 in the calculation]{.underline},
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} about **[[1 in 3.5 million]{.mark} per
year]{.underline}**. In comparison, that same American stands a 1 in
22,000 yearly chance of becoming a homicide victim, a 1 in 8,000 chance
of perishing in an auto accident, and a 1 in 500 chance of dying from
cancer. [[These calculations are based]{.underline}]{.mark}, of course,
[[on]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[historical data]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
However, **[[alarmists]{.underline}]{.mark}** [who]{.underline} would
[reject]{.underline} such [history [need]{.mark}
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} [[explain why they think terrorists]{.mark}
[will suddenly become]{.mark} vastly [more
competent]{.mark}]{.underline} in the future. But no one seems to be
making that argument. Indeed, notes one reporter, U.S. officials now say
that [al-Qaeda has become]{.underline} **[less capable of a large attack
like 9/11.]{.underline}** But she also says that they made this
disclosure only on condition of anonymity out of fear that "publicly
identifying themselves could make them a target" of terrorists. In
contrast, one terrorism specialist, Peter [Bergen]{.underline}, has
[observed]{.underline} in heroic full attribution mode that, "[The last
terror attack]{.underline} ([[in]{.underline}]{.mark} the West)
[was]{.underline} **[[seven years]{.mark} ago]{.underline}** [in
London]{.underline}," that [[there]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[haven't
been any major attacks]{.mark} in the U.S.]{.underline}**,"
[and]{.underline} that "[they are recruiting no-hopers and
dead-enders]{.underline}."

### Terror\-\--Ext\-\--No Impact

#### No impact to terrorism---they're not rocket scientists

**Mueller 13** (John Mueller -- political scientist at Ohio State and
senior fellow at the Cato Institute, Mark G. Stewart -- civil engineer
at the University of Newcastle in Australia and a visiting fellow at
Cato, April 22, "Hapless, Disorganized, and Irrational", CATO Institute,
<http://www.cato.org/publications/>
commentary/hapless-disorganized-irrational)

By far the most striking difference between the Boston Marathon killings
and these earlier cases is that, for the first time, terrorists actually
were able to assemble and detonate bombs. Many previous plotters
harbored visions of carrying out bombings, and in 10 of the cases, they
were supplied with fantasy-fulfilling, if bogus, bombs by obliging FBI
informants. But [until Boston, no]{.underline} would-be [terrorists had
been able to make and set one off]{.underline} on their own. And,
[except for four bombs detonated]{.underline} on the London transport
system [in 2005]{.underline}, [nor has any terrorist in the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[K]{.underline}**ingdom. This is surprising
in part because [in the 1970s there were hundreds of terrorist
incidents]{.underline} on U.S. soil, most of them bombings, killing 72
people.

In many other respects, however, the Boston Marathon bombing is quite
similar to the other 52 cases. For example, the Boston perpetrators were
clearly not suicidal, which is the standard in American cases. In only
six of the earlier plots were the perpetrators clearly willing to die in
their terrorist effort.

And [except for their ability to fabricate]{.underline} and detonate
[bombs]{.underline}, the [[Boston terrorists do not seem]{.mark} to have
been any [more competent than]{.mark} most of their
[predecessors]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The Department of Homeland
Security, in assessing what it ominously calls "the nature of the
terrorist adversary," is fond of stressing their
[[determination]{.mark}, persistence, relentlessness, patience, and
flexibility]{.underline}. This may apply to some terrorists somewhere,
including at least a few of those involved in the Sept. 11 attacks. But
it [**[scarcely describes]{.mark}** the **vast [majority]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark}]{.underline} those [individuals picked up on
[terror]{.mark}ism charges]{.underline} in the United States since those
attacks.

In describing the "adversary," the [[case studies]{.mark} far more
commonly [use words like]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[incompetent]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [**[ineffective]{.underline}**,
**[unintelligent]{.underline}**]{.mark},
**[[idiotic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[ignorant]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[inadequate]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[unorganized]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[misguided]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[muddled]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[amateurish]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [**[dopey]{.underline}**,
**[unrealistic]{.underline}**]{.mark},
**[[moronic]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[irrational]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [**[foolish]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[gullible]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Many of the cases
suggest that there is little exaggeration in the 2010 film, Four Lions,
the impressive dark comedy about a band of hapless home-grown British
terrorists.

Amazingly, the [Boston perpetrators]{.underline} apparently thought they
could somehow get away with their deed even though they chose to set
their bombs off at the most-photographed spot on the planet at the time.
Moreover, although they were not prepared to die with their bombs, they
[do not seem to have had anything that could be considered a coherent
plan of escape]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} rather **[[bizarre
inability]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to think about]{.mark} the
[aftermath]{.mark}]{.underline} of the planned deed
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} quite [[typical]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
case studies. (Also commonly found: an inability to explain how killing
a few random people would advance their cause.)

The [Boston perpetrators]{.underline} seem never to have ventured much
more than a few miles from the bombing location, and they appear to have
[had no reliable means of transport and]{.underline} no
[money]{.underline}. Then, when the police published their photographs,
they mindlessly blew whatever cover they had by killing a campus cop,
hijacking a car, stealing money, trying to run a police blockade, and
engaging in a brief Hollywood-style car chase and shootout.
[[Surveillance]{.underline}]{.mark} imagery [played an important role in
[identify]{.mark}ing]{.underline} the [[terrorists]{.underline}]{.mark}
(as it did in terrorist events in London in 2005), but the key
breakthrough appears to have come when the culprits decided to leave
their lair, after which the police applied standard killer-on-the-loose
methodology.

And while the scope of the tragedy [in Boston]{.underline} should not be
minimized, it should also be noted that, [[if the]{.underline}]{.mark}
terrorists' [[aim was to kill]{.mark} a large number of
[people]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the]{.underline}ir [[bombs]{.underline}
**[failed miserably]{.underline}**]{.mark}. As recent cases in Colorado
and Connecticut sadly demonstrate, far [[more fatalities have been
inflicted by gunmen]{.underline}.]{.mark}

Concern about "lone wolf" attacks has grown in recent years, and a 2011
DHS assessment concluded that "lone offenders currently present the
greatest threat." This is a reasonable observation, but those concerned
should keep in mind that, as Max Abrahms has noted, while [[lone
wolves]{.underline}]{.mark} may be difficult to police, they [have
carried out only two of the 1,900 most deadly terrorist attacks over the
last four decades]{.underline}. They may be harder to stop, but [they
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} also **[[less lethal]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
(It should also be kept in mind that [an [American's chance of being
killed by]{.mark} a]{.underline}ny kind of
[[terrorist]{.underline}]{.mark}, even with 9/11 included in the count,
[[remains]{.mark} about [one in]{.mark}]{.underline} 3 million or [[4
million]{.underline}]{.mark} per year.)

It is still unclear what motivated the Boston bombers. We are hearing a
lot about "radicalization," a concept that is not only vague but also
questionably suggests, as Arun Kundnani has pointed out, that violence
is inherent or implied in Muslims who become deeply religious.

Evidence from the 52 cases strongly indicates that [assuming an
ideological motivation for terrorism is not useful]{.underline}. In
almost all the cases, the overwhelming driving force was not something
that could be called ideology, but rather a simmering, and more commonly
boiling, outrage at U.S. foreign policy --- the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan, in particular, and the country's support for Israel in the
Palestinian conflict. Religion was a part of the consideration for most,
but not because they wished to spread Sharia law or to establish
caliphates (few of the culprits would be able to spell either word).
Rather they wanted to protect their co-religionists against what was
commonly seen to be a concentrated war upon them in the Middle East by
the U.S. government.

Rather remarkably, [none of the 52 cases after 9/11]{.underline} has
[inspired]{.underline} much in the way of [continued interest from the
public and]{.underline} the [media]{.underline}. [After
some]{.underline} days of [coverage]{.underline} --- or weeks in a very
few instances --- [they]{.underline} largely [faded]{.underline} from
attention. This is impressive because some were actually rather
threatening, and many were populated by colorful characters and involve
interesting law-and-order issues. [Books have been written about only
two]{.underline} of the cases, [and neither]{.underline} appears to have
[sold]{.underline} very [well.]{.underline} Whether the Boston Marathon
case will prove to be an exception --- perhaps because of its venue and
the manhunt --- is yet to be seen, of course.

#### You're more likely to die in your bathtub

**Brookings 8** (Institution, Independent Research and Policy Institute,
"Have We Exaggerated the Threat of Terrorism?", 7-18,
http://www.brookings.edu/events/2008/0221_terrorism.aspx)

[One participant argued that [terrorism presents **minimal** cause for
concern]{.mark}]{.underline}. Discounting war zones, [[studies
show]{.mark} that there have been [**very few**]{.mark} people [killed
by]{.mark} "Muslim [extremists]{.mark}" each year---in fact,
[more]{.mark} people [drown in bathtubs]{.mark} each year in the United
States]{.underline}. The FBI reported in 2005 that it had not found an
al-Qaeda presence in the United States. Additionally, terrorism, by its
very nature, can be self-defeating: [many [attacks by al-Qaeda]{.mark}
have [caused the group to lose popularity]{.mark}.]{.underline} This
participant questioned both the intentions and capability of al-Qaeda.
[Osama bin Laden has threatened many attacks that he has not been able
to execute]{.underline}. In specific, this participant thought it
unlikely that that al-Qaeda would obtain nuclear weapons, despite fears
to the contrary. Another participant agreed that the [[fears about
terrorism are **exaggerated**]{.underline}]{.mark} and differentiated
between the actual campaign against al-Qaeda and its supporters and the
idea of a general "war on terrorism." However, participants also
detailed the larger problems that terrorism can create, regardless of
the numbers it kills directly: terrorism often leads to insurgencies or
civil wars; it could destabilize U.S. allies in the Middle East and the
whole Middle Eastern architecture; terrorism keeps oil prices high; and
it has psychological effects beyond the actual death tolls.
Additionally, many planned attacks have been stopped before they were
carried out; one participant noted that there have been several
near-misses recently. One participant argued that the war on terrorism
is actually about an ideological battle between the United States and
its allies and radical forces. Another participant agreed with this
assessment of the general struggle between the United States and
"radical Islamic extremism." This participant noted that the larger
struggle is much more complicated to understand than terrorism in
specific and that this leads to a disproportionate focus on terrorism
and the accompanying misallocation of resources. Participants
highlighted the difference between the risks presented by terrorism in
the United States and around the world. The impact of terrorism in Iraq
and Lebanon, for instance, is completely different than the impact in
the United States, which one participant categorized as being
essentially psychological. The relevance of the capability of
governments at preventing terrorism was also addressed. Terrorism is
particularly dangerous in places where there is weak government capacity
and rule of law. Participants discussed why has [[there not been
another]{.mark} terrorist [attack]{.mark} in the United States [since
September 11]{.mark}, 2001]{.underline}. One participant presented
several reasons: [[the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [has a
supportive]{.mark} domestic [Muslim population]{.mark}; the would-be
[terrorists]{.mark} in the United States [are not skilled; and U.S.
counterterrorism policy has made it more difficult]{.mark} for the
al-Qaeda core [to plan complex attacks]{.mark}.]{.underline} This
participant argued, however, that there are risks that this situation
may change going forward. As the al-Qaeda core reconstitutes itself in
Pakistan, it may be able to plan more complex attacks again.
Additionally, the U.S. Muslim population may become less supportive
overtime as a result of U.S. homeland security policy. However, another
participant did not think the attitudes of the U.S. Muslim community
were particularly relevant to this debate.

#### It\'s not an existential risk

**Mueller, 11** (John Mueller, Professor of Political Science at Ohio
State University, 8-2-11, "The Truth About al Qaeda,"
http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/68012/john-mueller/the-truth-about-al-qaeda?)

Indeed, [[no Muslim extremist has succeeded in
detonating]{.underline}]{.mark} even [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} simple
[[bomb in the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [in the last ten years,]{.underline}
and except for the attacks on the London Underground in 2005, neither
has any in the United Kingdom. [It [seems wildly unlikely]{.mark} that
[al Qaeda is remotely ready to go nuclear]{.mark}.]{.underline} Outside
of war zones, [the [amount of killing]{.mark} carried out by al Qaeda
and al Qaeda linkees]{.underline}, maybes, and wannabes [throughout the
entire world [since 9/11 stands at]{.mark}]{.underline} perhaps [[a few
hundred]{.mark} per year.]{.underline} That\'s a few hundred too many,
of course, but [it [scarcely presents an
existential]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} or elephantine,
[[threat]{.mark}.]{.underline} And [the [likelihood that an American
will be killed by a terrorist]{.mark} of any ilk [stands at one in 3.5
million]{.mark} per year,]{.underline} even with 9/11 included. That
probability will remain unchanged unless terrorists are able to increase
their capabilities massively \-- and obtaining nuclear weapons would
allow them to do so. Although al Qaeda may have dreamed from time to
time about getting such weapons, no other terrorist group has even gone
so far as to indulge in such dreams, with the exception of the Japanese
cult [Aum Shinrikyo]{.underline}, which [leased the mineral rights to
a]{.underline}n Australian sheep [ranch that sat on uranium deposits,
purchased some semi-relevant equipment, and tried to buy a finished bomb
from the Russians.]{.underline} That experience, however, cannot be very
encouraging to the would-be atomic terrorist. [Even though it was flush
with funds and undistracted by drone attacks]{.underline} (or even by
much surveillance), [Aum Shinrikyo abandoned its atomic efforts in
frustration very early on. It]{.underline} then [moved to
bio]{.underline}logical [weapons, another complete failure that inspired
its leader to suggest that fears expressed in the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [of a biological attack
were]{.underline} actually [a ruse to tempt terrorist groups to pursue
the weapons.]{.underline} The group did finally manage to release some
sarin gas in a Tokyo subway that killed 13 and led to the group\'s
terminal shutdown, as well as to 16 years (and counting) of
pronouncements that WMD terrorism is the wave of the future. No
elephants there, either.

### Terror\-\--Ext\-\--No Impact\-\--A2: Retaliation

#### No retaliation

**Davis and Jenkins 2** (Paul K., Professor -- RAND Corporation and
Research Leader -- Naval Studies Board, and Brian M., Special Advisor --
RAND Corporation and International Chamber of Commerce, RAND Research
Paper,

http://www.rand.org/publications/MR/MR1619/MR1619.pdf)

Deterring acquisition and use of WMD is profoundly important and
difficult. Terrorists appear to have grandiose intentions, and some have
intense interest in such weapons. Moreover, they may believe that they
have what a Cold War theorist would call "escalation dominance." That
is, al Qaeda could use WMD against the United States, but
[[retaliation]{.underline}]{.mark}---and certainly escalation--- [[would
be difficult because]{.underline}]{.mark} (1) [the]{.underline}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[will not use chemical, bio]{.mark}logical[, or radiological
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}; (2) its [[nuclear weapons will seldom be
suitable]{.underline}]{.mark} for use; and (3) [there are [no good
targets]{.mark}]{.underline} (the [[terrorists]{.underline}]{.mark}
themselves [[fade]{.underline}]{.mark} into the woodwork).
[[And]{.underline}]{.mark}, of course, [[the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[has
constraints]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although this gap in the deterrent
framework is dismissed by some, we regard it as very dangerous.

### Terror\-\--Ext\-\--No Terror

#### No large-scale terror -- [psychology]{.underline} means you should [purposely deflate]{.underline} their impact during the decision -- empirics and new defenses disprove their impacts

**Thompson 16** \-\-\-- Mark, Pulitzer Prize winning defense columnist,
Bachelors from Boston University, "Obama Puts Terrorism in Perspective
in State of the Union," Time -- Politics,
<http://time.com/4178403/state-of-the-union-terrorism/>

President [[Obama]{.underline}]{.mark} basically [[told]{.mark} the
nation to]{.underline} **[[take a "chill pill"]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[over]{.underline} the threat posed to Americans by [ISIS
and]{.underline} other [terror]{.underline}ists in his final State of
the Union address Tuesday night.

"Over-the-top [claims]{.underline} that [this is World War
III]{.underline} **[just play into their hands]{.underline}**," Obama
said. "Masses of [[fighters on]{.underline}]{.mark} the [back
of]{.underline} **[pickup [trucks]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and]{.mark}
twisted souls]{.underline} plotting [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} apartments
or **[[garages]{.underline}]{.mark}** pose an enormous danger to
civilians and must be stopped. But they **[[do not threaten]{.mark} our
national [existence]{.mark}."]{.underline}**

**[[Echoing]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the views of]{.underline}
**[most]{.underline}** [non-politicized]{.underline} U.S.
[terrorism]{.underline} [**[experts]{.underline}**, [he
urged]{.underline}]{.mark} [the nation to keep terror]{.underline}
attacks [in [perspective]{.mark}]{.underline}. The priority, they say,
is to keep nuclear weapons away from terrorists and deny them the
ability to launch 9/11-like attacks. But smaller-scale terror, like the
killing of 14 Americans in San Bernardino, California, Dec. 2 by a
husband-wife team of radicalized Muslims, may be impossible to prevent.

While Obama may have the facts on his side, people's irrational fears
often overwhelm facts. It's the politician's job to acknowledge that
fear, while harnessing it to keep the facts that fuel it from getting
any worse. That's where Obama has fallen short.

His message was muddled as Iran held 10 U.S. sailors as he spoke. Iran
seized them several hours before the speech, after their two patrol
craft apparently drifted into Iranian territorial waters near Iran's
Farsi Island in the middle of the northern Persian Gulf. The Obama
Administration said it had assurances from Tehran that the sailors and
their boats would soon be released. Obama didn't mention them in his
address.

Calming fears of terrorism remains a challenge. Obama erred, at least
politically, when he called ISIS a "JV team" two years ago---before it
started beheading Americans---and said it was "contained" just before
the terror attacks in Paris and California killed 144.

Americans' [preoccupation with terrorism]{.underline}, while
understandable, [stands in]{.underline} **[marked
contrast]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} their [toleration for
other]{.underline} kinds of violent [death]{.underline}. In 2014,
[[32,675]{.mark} U.S. residents [died in]{.mark} highway
[accidents]{.mark}]{.underline}, 33,599 died by
firearms---[and]{.underline} **[[17]{.underline}]{.mark}** [were killed
[in terror]{.mark}]{.underline} attacks on U.S. soil. That
[preoccupation can warp]{.underline} public [attention]{.underline} and
investment---and makes an over-reaction (cf., the 2003 invasion of Iraq)
more likely if another major terror attack were to occur.

"[Public opinion poll [data show]{.mark}]{.underline} that the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [suffers]{.underline}
a long-term, routinized, **[[mass anxiety]{.underline}]{.mark}**---or at
least a sense of concern---about terrorism that has shown little sign of
waning in the years since 2001," terrorism analysts John [Mueller
and]{.underline} Mark [Stewart wrote]{.underline} last month in Foreign
Affairs. "Although other issues---particularly economic ones---often
crowded out terrorism as a topic of daily concern, terrorism has won an
apparently permanent space in the American mind."

By most accounts the world, in fits and starts, is becoming more
peaceful. Put bluntly: you have less chance of dying in war today than
in the past. But such reassurances can be fleeting. Sure, the Atlantic
and Pacific oceans acted as walls against invaders for most of the
nation's history. And the advent of nuclear weapons 70 years ago stayed
the hands of nation-states when it came to warring against one another.

But terrorism---designed to inflict fright---is a different beast.
First, because of its relatively small scale, it can be unleashed nearly
anywhere, against nearly anyone. Terrorism doesn't target soldiers on
the battlefield---who, by and large, are young men who know their
mission is dangerous. Instead, [terrorism]{.underline} targets
civilians, including children, going about their daily lives. It's that
[jarring juxtaposition]{.underline}---the idea that one isn't truly
safe, anywhere---that [lets terrorism pack a punch far **above its
throw-weight class**]{.underline}.

The turning point in the U.S. attitude toward terror, justifiably, was
9/11. For most Americans, the attacks that day came clear out of the
blue, raining horror on a U.S. public who believed that such violence,
when it happened, took place in troubled lands far away, like the Middle
East. The willingness of the perpetrators to die in their lust to kill
surprised, and scared, many Americans. While that fright has ebbed and
flowed, it hasn't gone away, and surges anew in the wake of terror
attacks.

[[Following]{.underline}]{.mark} the [attacks on the [World Trade
Center]{.mark} and]{.underline} the [Pentagon]{.underline}---and a
hijacked airliner brought down in rural Pennsylvania by passengers whose
delayed takeoff let them learn of their grim fate---[[Americans]{.mark}
were filled with a [sense]{.mark} of foreboding that]{.underline} more
major [[attacks]{.mark} were]{.underline} all but
[inevitable]{.underline}. But **[[that hasn't
happened]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The 9/11 hijackers fired vulnerable U.S. airliners into defenseless U.S.
buildings and killed nearly 3,000. In other words, the only way they
could carry out their plot was if they outfitted themselves with U.S.
equipment. [Following]{.underline} the [attacks]{.underline},
**[local]{.underline}**, **[state]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[federal]{.underline}** [[governments]{.underline}]{.mark} have
**[built, or [bolstered, defenses]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[against]{.underline} future [terror]{.underline} strikes.

[[There hasn't been]{.mark} a similar [attack]{.mark}]{.underline} on
U.S. soil---fingers crossed---**[in nearly 15 years]{.underline}**.
[[That's]{.mark} the]{.underline} **[[key]{.mark} fact]{.underline}** to
keep in mind, [[amid]{.mark} the]{.underline} **[fusillade of
[fear-mongering]{.mark}]{.underline}** the 2016 presidential campaign
has already unleashed.

#### Theoretical possibilities are irrelevant -- there are too many difficult steps which make it functionally impossible 

**Chapman 12** (Stephen, editorial writer for Chicago Tribune, "Chapman:
Nuclear terrorism unlikely," May 22,
<http://www.oaoa.com/articles/chapman-87719-nuclear-terrorism.html>)

A layperson may figure it's only a matter of time before the
unimaginable comes to pass. Harvard's Graham Allison, in his book
"Nuclear Terrorism," concludes, "On the current course, nuclear
terrorism is inevitable." But remember: [Afxter Sept. 11]{.underline},
2001, [we all thought more attacks were a certainty. Yet
al-Qaida]{.underline} and its ideological kin [have proved unable to
mount a second strike. [Given]{.mark} their [inability to do something
simple]{.mark} --- say, shoot up a shopping mall or set off a truck bomb
--- [it's reasonable to ask whether they have a chance at
something]{.mark} much more [ambitious]{.mark}]{.underline}. Far from
being plausible, argued Ohio State University professor John Mueller in
a presentation at the University of Chicago, "[[the likelihood]{.mark}
that a [terrorist]{.mark} group [will come up with an atomic bomb seems
to be vanishingly small]{.mark}]{.underline}." [[The events
required]{.underline}]{.mark} to make that happen [comprise a [multitude
of Herculean tasks. First, a terrorist]{.mark}]{.underline} group [[has
to get a bomb]{.mark} or fissile material]{.underline}, perhaps from
Russia's inventory of decommissioned warheads. [[If that were easy, one
would have already gone missing]{.underline}]{.mark}. Besides, [those
devices are probably no longer a danger,]{.underline} since weapons that
are not maintained quickly become what one expert calls "radioactive
scrap metal[." [If terrorists were able to steal a Pakistani bomb, they
would still have to defeat the arming codes and other
safeguards]{.mark}]{.underline} designed to prevent unauthorized use.
[[As for Iran, no nuclear state has ever given a bomb to an ally]{.mark}
--- for reasons even the Iranians can grasp]{.underline}. Stealing some
100 pounds of bomb fuel would require help from rogue individuals inside
some government who are prepared to jeopardize their own lives. [[Then
comes the task of building]{.mark} a bomb. [It's not something you can
gin up]{.mark} with spare parts and power tools in your garage. [It
requires millions]{.mark} of dollars, a [safe haven and advanced
equipment]{.mark} --- plus [people with specialized skills, lots of time
and a willingness to die for the cause]{.mark}]{.underline}. Assuming
the jihadists vault over those Himalayas[, [they would have to deliver
the weapon onto American soil]{.mark}.]{.underline} Sure, drug smugglers
bring in contraband all the time --- but seeking their help would
confront the plotters with possible exposure or extortion.
[[This]{.mark}, like every other step in the entire process, [means
expanding the circle of people who know]{.mark} what's going
on]{.underline}, [[multiplying the chance someone will blab]{.mark},
back out [or screw up]{.mark}]{.underline}. That has heartening
implications. If al-Qaida embarks on the project, it has only a
minuscule chance of seeing it bear fruit. [[Given the]{.mark} formidable
[odds, it probably won't bother]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} None of
this means we should stop trying to minimize the risk by securing
nuclear stockpiles, monitoring terrorist communications and improving
port screening. But it offers good reason to think that in this war, it
appears, [the worst eventuality is one that will never
happen]{.underline}

### Trade\-\--IL\-\--1NC

#### Arms sales [won't derail]{.underline} trade talks -- they're being used as leverage and more tied to geostrategic considerations

**Sputnik 19** \-\-\-- citing Paul Huang who is an East Asian columnist
for *The Epoch Times* and master's candidate at the Fletcher School of
Law and Diplomacy (Tufts University) along with Benjamin Cavender who is
the Director of The China Market Research Group and MBA (Columbia
University), "How Can Prospect of Taiwanese F-16 Procurement Affect US
Trade Talks With China?" 3/26,
https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201903261073564311-f-16-taiwan/

Impact on Trade Talks Between China and the US

[[The request for F-16 supplies]{.mark} to Taiwan]{.underline} also
[[comes amid]{.underline}]{.mark} crucial [[trade talks]{.mark} between
Beijing and Washington]{.underline}. The two states were embroiled in a
trade war in 2018, mutually imposing hefty tariffs on goods worth
billions of dollars. The US and China have recently made certain
progress towards striking a new trade deal, according to Donald Trump,
who recently refused to impose a new round of tariffs in order to avoid
hampering the trade talks.

Paul [Huang]{.underline} was at a loss to predict if Beijing would
retaliate against the F-16 supplies to Taiwan via its trade talks with
the US, but at the same time [suggested that [Washington could
be]{.mark} [using the matter **to pressure China**]{.mark} **in the
talks.**]{.underline}

**[\"If anything]{.underline}**, [having the option to sell [arms to
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline} **[actually [gives US decision
makers]{.mark} a considerable [leverage]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in its
negotiating position with Beijing\", Huang said.]{.underline}

[[Cavender]{.underline} **[also]{.underline}**
[suggested]{.underline}]{.mark} that the possibility of [selling
[F-16s]{.mark}]{.underline} to Taiwan **[[could be used]{.mark} by
Washington]{.underline}** [[in]{.mark} trade [talks]{.mark}]{.underline}
with Beijing, [[but noted]{.underline}]{.mark} that **[there could be
[other reasons]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to permit the sale]{.mark} of
the jets]{.underline}.

[\"This]{.underline} potential [deal does come]{.underline} at the same
time [as the US is completing]{.underline} arms [sales to]{.underline}
its [other allies]{.underline} in the region who are [concerned about
China\'s military build-up\", he said.]{.underline}

#### No trade deal [regardless]{.underline} and it [wouldn't solve]{.underline} their impacts

Imploding," *Politico*, 2019,
<https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/10/trump-china-trade-1422319>

President Donald [[Trump is heading to]{.underline}]{.mark}ward his
[2020]{.underline} reelection campaign [with]{.underline} **[virtually
[nothing]{.mark}]{.underline}** [to show [for his]{.mark}]{.underline}
big [[trade promises]{.mark} --- except for angry farmers and a
**jittery stock market.**]{.underline}

[[A]{.mark} long-sought [deal with China]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[appears]{.mark} to be [falling apart]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
[exposing businesses]{.underline} on both sides of the Pacific
[to]{.underline} **[more tariffs]{.underline}** and **[steep
losses]{.underline}** [for farmers.]{.underline} His new pact with
Canada and Mexico is facing significant opposition in Congress even from
Republicans, who are demanding that he lift steel and aluminum tariffs
before they'll vote on it. Deals with the European Union, Japan and
Great Britain are also stalled by politics here and abroad.

[Trump's]{.underline} **[failure]{.underline}** to reach agreements with
America's trading partners [could have a **brutal impact on the
economy**]{.underline} and his reelection effort, even if his base likes
his tough talk on China. By the time voters head to the polls in 2020,
[the prices of consumer goods could be **skyrocketing**]{.underline}.
[Farmers may be **swamped with products they can't sell
abroad**]{.underline}. [And a **bear market**]{.underline} [could
be]{.underline} **[shrinking everyone's retirement]{.underline}**
savings.

So far, Trump has only one trade agreement to his name after two years
in office: A relatively minor agreement with South Korea that didn't
require approval from Congress.

What he has achieved are mostly unilateral actions: imposing tariffs on
more than \$50 billion of steel and aluminum imports from both allies
and adversaries and tariffs on \$250 billion of Chinese goods. He\'s
also threatening to raise tariffs on a remaining \$325 billion of
China\'s exports.

[["He's **a one-trick pony**]{.underline}. [He only knows how
to]{.underline}]{.mark} do one thing: [[impose tariffs,"
said]{.underline}]{.mark} Bill [[Reinsch]{.underline}]{.mark}, a trade
expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment, but did put
out a press release Friday listing statements of support for Trump\'s
handling of the trade talks.

[[Reinsch]{.underline}]{.mark}, a former Commerce Department official,
[said he [sees **only a slight chance**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[of]{.mark} Trump eking out [a]{.mark} political [victory in]{.mark}
the [China talks]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [which grew]{.underline}
**[more]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[tense]{.underline}]{.mark}** Monday
[[after Beijing **pledged to retaliate**]{.underline}]{.mark} [against
the U.S. with fresh tariffs]{.underline} on \$60 billion in American
goods.

[[He\'s **more likely**]{.underline} [to come]{.underline}]{.mark} [back
[with a deal]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[Democrats]{.mark}
will]{.underline} be able to successfully [[portray as **too
weak**]{.mark} and a **cave to Beijing**, Reinsch said.]{.underline}

[[Or he\'ll walk away]{.underline}]{.mark} from the talks, [leaving
tariffs]{.underline} in place on potentially \$575 billion worth of
Chinese goods --- everything from clothing and toys to Apple iPhones and
computers.

[In that scenario, China is expected to increase its]{.underline}
already [substantial retaliation on U.S. exports]{.underline}, such as
farm goods, seafood and chemicals. Boeing aircraft, which Beijing has
spared so far, could also face increased duties.

That would allow Democrats to accuse Trump of being a terrible trade
negotiator who has inflicted pain on U.S. farmers and businesses without
achieving his goal of forcing China to make trade reforms, Reinsch said.

[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} has [repeatedly
[stressed]{.mark}]{.underline} his desire for [an agreement that reins
in]{.underline} China\'s [[trade and]{.mark} **[i]{.mark}**ntellectual
**[p]{.mark}**roperty [abuses]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
**[But]{.underline}**]{.mark} [he also [seems content with simply
imposing higher duties]{.mark} on all Chinese goods.]{.underline}

### Trade\-\--IL\-\--Ext\-\--No Deal

#### [No deal]{.underline} -- China [won't backdown]{.underline} -- latest White Paper

York Times, B.A. in political science (McGill University), "China
Strikes Defiant Stance on Trade Against Trump," New York Times, 2019,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/02/business/china-trump-trade-fedex.html>

BEIJING --- [[China struck a]{.underline} **[defiant
stance]{.underline}**]{.mark} on Sunday [in response
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} President [[Trump]{.mark}'s]{.underline}
growing [pressure on trade]{.underline}, [**[blaming]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[for a **breakdown in**]{.mark}
**[negotiations]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and saying]{.underline} **[it
must withdraw]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[its latest round of
[tariffs]{.mark}]{.underline}** [before a deal can be
reached]{.underline}.

[[In a white paper]{.underline}]{.mark} released Sunday morning,
[[Chinese officials showed]{.underline} **[little
indication]{.underline}**]{.mark} that [[they would back down]{.mark},
sending a signal that]{.underline} [**[confrontation]{.underline}** [is
the government's]{.underline}]{.mark} formal
[[approach]{.underline}]{.mark} to its trade dispute with Washington.
[The white paper came less than two days after [the Chinese government
**threatened**]{.mark}]{.underline} to put [[American companies and
individuals]{.underline}]{.mark} on a blacklist if they stopped
supplying their Chinese partners, without citing specifics.

[["China]{.underline} **[will never give in]{.underline}**]{.mark} [on
major issues of principle," [the]{.mark} white [paper said.
"China]{.mark}]{.underline} isn't willing to fight a trade war, but it
**[isn't afraid to fight]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[[will
fight]{.underline}]{.mark}** if necessary. That attitude has not
changed."

The white paper was released at a hastily arranged news conference on
Sunday morning featuring Wang Shouwen, the Chinese vice minister of
commerce and deputy China international trade representative.

"When you give them an inch, the U.S. wants a yard," Mr. [[Wang
said]{.underline}]{.mark}, adding that [[the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[insisted on]{.underline} **["unreasonably high demands"]{.underline}**
[that crossed]{.underline}]{.mark} over [[into]{.underline}]{.mark} the
area of **[["intervening with]{.mark} China's
[sovereignty."]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The [Trump]{.underline} administration's latest [efforts to ramp up
pressure]{.underline} on China ["show very clearly who should take
responsibility"]{.underline} for the current state of relations, [he
added.]{.underline}

While [[the]{.mark} white [paper]{.mark}]{.underline} did not list any
specific new threats, it [[showed]{.underline}]{.mark} an
[**["alarming"]{.underline}**]{.mark} amount of [[defiance]{.mark},
said]{.underline} Diana [Choyleva]{.underline}, chief economist at Enodo
Economics.

["It's]{.underline} not necessarily an escalation as such, but a
[confirmation]{.underline} that [China is]{.underline} now **[digging
its heels in]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[preparing for a
drawn-out conflict]{.underline}**," Ms. [Choyleva said]{.underline}.
"**[[There won't be]{.mark} any [papering over]{.mark} the
[cracks]{.mark}]{.underline}** as any potential trade deal would have
been."

[China uses white papers to detail and formalize]{.underline} its
response to often contentious issues, indicating that the government
holds [a singular and unified view]{.underline} on the matter.

<https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/02/business/china-trump-trade-fedex.html>

The paper was released less than a month after Mr. [[Trump raised
tariffs]{.mark} on Chinese]{.underline}-made [products [and
threatened]{.mark}]{.underline} to impose [**[still more]{.underline}**
[after accusing China of backing]{.underline}]{.mark} [[away
from]{.underline}]{.mark} its [earlier [commitments.
It]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[follows]{.mark} [the
announcement]{.mark}]{.underline} three weeks ago that the
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [[would restrict
Huawei]{.underline}]{.mark}, a Chinese telecommunications company that
the United States considers a security threat, [from access to
essential]{.underline} American-made [tech]{.underline}nology like chips
and software.

Mr. [[Wang called the]{.mark} Huawei [move]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[a
"severe setback"]{.underline}** [for negotiations]{.underline}]{.mark}
between the two countries, [saying [it had]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**["unduly escalated trade frictions."]{.underline}**]{.mark}

### Trade\-\--Econ\-\--1NC

#### Economy [resilient]{.underline} -- their impacts are epistemologically faulty and exaggerated -- durability of macro-economic trends, empirical examples of the policy/economic disconnect, offset uncertainty for households/businesses, and faith in intervening actors

**SEB 17** \-\-\-- Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken Group, "**[Global
[Economy Resilient to]{.mark} New Political
[Challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}**," 2/22,
https://sebgroup.com/press/news/global-economy-resilient-to-new-political-challenges

The [interplay between economics and politics was]{.underline}
undoubtedly a [dominant]{.underline} feature of analyses [during
2016]{.underline}. As we know, it was difficult to foresee both election
results and their economic consequences. It was certainly not strange
that economists were unable to predict the Brexit referendum outcome or
Donald Trump's victory, when public opinion polling organisations and
betting firms failed to do so, but lessons might be learned from the
economic assessment impacts they made. [[Economists]{.underline}]{.mark}
probably **[tend to [exaggerate]{.mark}]{.underline}** [the]{.underline}
[importance of more general [political phenomena]{.mark}]{.underline}.
While in the midst of elections that appear historically important, [[it
is **tempting to present alarmist**]{.mark}
**[projections]{.mark}**]{.underline} about election outcomes [that seem
improbable and/or]{.underline} [unpleasant]{.underline}.
[**[But]{.underline}** [once]{.underline}]{.mark} [the initial
[shock]{.mark} effect [has faded]{.mark}, **more
[ordinary]{.mark}**]{.underline} economic [[data]{.mark} such
as]{.underline} corporate reports and [macroeconomic
figures]{.underline} **[[take the upper hand]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[Psychological effects often exaggerated]{.underline}

[One important observation is]{.underline} that [[it is **difficult to
find any**]{.mark} **historical [correlation]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[between]{.mark} heightened]{.underline} security [[policy
tensions]{.underline} [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [[economic
activity]{.underline}. [Households and businesses]{.underline} **[do not
seem]{.underline}**]{.mark} to be [especially [sensitive]{.mark} in
their consumption or capital]{.underline} [spending]{.underline}
behaviour. This is perhaps because [[uncertainty]{.underline} **[is
offset]{.underline}** [by investments]{.underline}]{.mark} in a defence
build-up, for example. Only when the conditions that directly determine
profitability and investments are affected, for example via rising oil
prices or poorly functioning financial markets, will the effects become
clear.

[[Markets]{.mark} also]{.underline} seem to [[have]{.mark} a **general
[tendency]{.mark}** [to assume]{.mark}]{.underline} that the [economic
[policy makers]{.mark} can actually]{.underline} **[[behave
rationally]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in crisis situations,]{.underline}
until this has been disproved. **[Both]{.underline}** [[during]{.mark}
the US sub-prime]{.underline} mortgage [crisis of]{.underline}
2007-[20[08]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} the [euro
zone]{.mark}\'s]{.underline} [existential crisis]{.underline} a few
years later, [for a rather long time the [market **maintained**]{.mark}
**its [faith]{.mark}** that a response would come]{.underline}. [Not
[until]{.mark} after a [lengthy]{.mark} period of [inept
actions]{.mark}]{.underline} by decision makers [did these crises become
genuinely acute]{.underline}, with large secondary effects as a
consequence. This [market \"[patience\" is]{.mark}]{.underline}
presumably [[based]{.mark} [on]{.mark} a long-time [pattern of]{.mark}
recurring [bailout measures]{.mark}]{.underline} by governments and
central banks, [which usually benefit risk-taking]{.underline} at the
expense of caution or speculation that policy responses will not
materialise.\\

#### Econ decline [doesn't]{.underline} cause conflict

from International Rivalries," April 22, 2015,
http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2597712

[[Do economic downturns generate]{.mark} pressure for diversionary
[conflict?]{.mark}]{.underline} Or might downturns encourage austerity
and economizing behavior in foreign policy? [This paper provides new
evidence that [economic stress is associated with **conciliatory
policies**]{.mark} **between strategic rivals.**]{.underline} For states
that view each other as military threats, the biggest step possible
toward bilateral cooperation is to terminate the rivalry by taking
political steps to manage the competition. [[Drawing on data from **109
distinct rival dyads**]{.mark} since 1950, **[67 of which
terminated,]{.mark}** the [evidence suggests rivalries were]{.mark}
approximately **[twice as likely to terminate during]{.mark} economic
[downturns]{.mark}**]{.underline} than they were during periods of
economic normalcy. [This is true [controlling for **all** ]{.mark}**of
the [main alternative explanations for peaceful relations]{.mark}
between foes**]{.underline} (democratic status, nuclear weapons
possession, capability imbalance, common enemies, and international
**[[systemic changes),]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[as well as]{.mark}
**many** **[other]{.mark}** possible [**confounding variables**.
This]{.mark}]{.underline} research [**[questions existing
theories]{.underline}** [claiming]{.underline}]{.mark} that [economic
[downturns are associated with **diversionary war**, and]{.mark} instead
[argues]{.mark}]{.underline} that in certain circumstances **[[peace may
result from economic troubles]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

### Trade\-\--Econ\-\--Ext\-\--No War

[The final]{.underline} significant [outcome addresses **[a dog that
hasn\'t barked]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [the effect of [the Great
Recession]{.mark} on]{.underline} cross-border [conflict]{.underline}
and violence. During the initial stages of the crisis, multiple
[[analysts asserted]{.underline}]{.mark} that the financial [[crisis
would lead]{.underline}]{.mark} states [[to]{.underline}]{.mark}
increase their use of [[force]{.underline}]{.mark} as a tool [[for
staying in power]{.underline}]{.mark}.42 [They voiced]{.underline}
genuine [concern]{.underline} that the global economic [downturn would
lead to an]{.underline} [increase in conflict]{.underline}---whether
[through]{.underline} greater [internal [repression]{.mark},
[diversion]{.mark}ary wars, [arms races, or]{.mark}]{.underline} a
[[ratcheting up]{.underline}]{.mark} of great power
[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. Violence in the Middle East, border
disputes in the South China Sea, and even the disruptions of the Occupy
movement fueled impressions of a surge in global public disorder. The
**[aggregate [data suggest otherwise]{.mark}]{.underline}**, however.
The [Institute for Economics and Peace]{.underline} has
[concluded]{.underline} that \"the average level of
[[peace]{.mark}fulness [in 2012 is]{.mark}]{.underline} approximately
[[the same as]{.underline}]{.mark} it was in
[200[7]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"43 [Interstate
[violence]{.mark}]{.underline} in particular has
**[[declined]{.underline}]{.mark}** since the start of the financial
crisis[, [as have]{.underline}]{.mark} [military
[expenditures]{.mark}]{.underline} in most sampled countries. [Other
studies confirm]{.underline} that [the Great Recession]{.underline}
**[has not triggered any increase in violent conflict]{.underline}**, as
Lotta Themner and Peter Wallensteen conclude: \"\[[T\]he pattern
is]{.underline} one of [relative stability]{.underline} when we consider
the trend for the past five years.\"44 The secular decline in violence
that started with the end of the Cold War has not been reversed. Rogers
[[Brubaker]{.underline} [observes]{.underline}]{.mark} that \"[the
[crisis has not]{.mark} to date [generated]{.mark} the surge in
[protectionist nationalism or ethnic exclusion]{.mark}]{.underline} that

#### Empirically denied, instability burns out, and no backing for extremism -- reject their evidence, it's internet fear-mongering

"The New Rules: Security Remains Stable Amid Financial Crisis", Asset
Protection Network, 8-25,
http://www.aprodex.com/the-new-rules\--security-remains-stable-amid-financial-crisis-398-bl.aspx)

[When the]{.underline} global [financial crisis struck]{.underline}
roughly a year ago, [the blogosphere was ablaze with]{.underline} all
sorts of [scary predictions of]{.underline}, and commentary regarding,
[ensuing]{.underline} conflict and [wars \-- a rerun of the Great
Depression leading to world war]{.underline}, as it were. Now, as global
economic news brightens and recovery \-- surprisingly led by China and
emerging markets \-- is the talk of the day, it\'s interesting to look
back over the past year and realize how globalization\'s first truly
[[worldwide recession has had **virtually no impact**]{.mark} whatsoever
[on]{.mark} the [international security]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}landscape. [[No]{.mark}ne of the]{.underline} more than
three-dozen [[ongoing conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark} listed by
GlobalSecurity.org [[can be]{.underline}]{.mark} clearly [[attributed to
the]{.mark} global [recession]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [the last
new entry]{.underline} (civil conflict between Hamas and Fatah
[in]{.underline} the [Palestine)]{.underline} [**predates** the economic
crisis]{.underline} by a year, and three quarters of the chronic
struggles began in the last century. Ditto for the 15 low-intensity
conflicts listed by Wikipedia (where the latest entry is the Mexican
\"drug war\" begun in 2006). Certainly, the Russia-Georgia conflict last
August was specifically timed, but by most accounts the opening ceremony
of the Beijing Olympics was the most important external trigger
(followed by the U.S. presidential campaign) for that sudden spike in an
almost two-decade long struggle between Georgia and its two breakaway
regions. Looking over the various databases, then, we see a most
familiar picture: the usual mix of civil conflicts, insurgencies, and
liberation-themed terrorist movements. [Besides]{.underline} the recent
[Russia-Georgia]{.underline} dust-up, [[the only]{.underline}]{.mark}
two potential [state-on-state [wars]{.mark} (North v. South Korea,
Israel v. Iran) [are]{.mark}]{.underline} both tied to one side
acquiring a nuclear weapon capacity \-- a process [[**wholly unrelated**
to]{.mark} global [economic trends]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [with the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
effectively [tied down by]{.underline} its two ongoing major
interventions (Iraq and
[Afghanistan-]{.underline}bleeding-into-Pakistan), our
[[involvement]{.mark} elsewhere]{.underline} around the planet [[has
been]{.mark} quite **[modest]{.mark}**]{.underline}, both leading up to
and following the onset of the economic crisis: e.g., the usual
counter-drug efforts in Latin America, the usual military exercises with
allies across Asia, mixing it up with pirates off Somalia\'s coast).
[[Everywhere]{.mark} else [we find]{.mark} serious [instability
we]{.mark}]{.underline} pretty much **[[let it
burn]{.underline}]{.mark}**, occasionally pressing the Chinese \--
unsuccessfully \-- to do something. Our new Africa Command, for example,
hasn\'t led us to anything beyond advising and training local forces.
So, [[to sum up]{.mark}: No significant uptick in]{.underline} mass
[violence or unrest]{.underline} (remember the smattering of urban riots
last year in places like Greece, Moldova and Latvia?); The usual
frequency maintained in civil conflicts (in all the usual places);
[[**Not a single state-on-state war directly caused** (and no
great-power]{.mark}-on-great-power [crises]{.mark} even
[triggered]{.mark}); No]{.underline} great improvement or [disruption
in]{.underline} great-power [cooperation regarding]{.underline} the
emergence of new [nuclear powers]{.underline} (despite all that
diplomacy); A modest scaling back of international policing efforts by
the system\'s acknowledged Leviathan power (inevitable given the
strain); and No serious efforts by any rising great power to challenge
that Leviathan or supplant its role. (The worst things we can cite are
Moscow\'s occasional deployments of strategic assets to the Western
hemisphere and its weak efforts to outbid the United States on basing
rights in Kyrgyzstan; but the best include China and India stepping up
their aid and investments in Afghanistan and Iraq.) Sure, we\'ve finally
seen global defense spending surpass the previous world record set in
the late 1980s, but even that\'s likely to wane given the stress on
public budgets created by all this unprecedented \"stimulus\" spending.
If anything, the friendly cooperation on such stimulus packaging was the
most notable great-power dynamic caused by the crisis. [Can we
say]{.underline} that [the world has suffered a]{.underline} distinct
[shift to]{.underline} political [radicalism]{.underline} as a result of
the economic crisis? Indeed, [no. The]{.underline} world\'s [major
economies remain]{.underline} governed by [center-left]{.underline} or
center-right political factions that remain decidedly friendly to both
markets and trade. [In the short run, there were]{.underline} attempts
across the board to insulate economies from immediate damage (in effect,
as much [protectionism]{.underline} as allowed under current trade
rules), [but]{.underline} there was [[no]{.mark} great [slide into
\"trade wars.\"]{.mark}]{.underline} Instead, [[the
**W**]{.underline}]{.mark}orld **[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**rade
**[[O]{.underline}]{.mark}**rganization [[is
functioning]{.underline}]{.mark} as it was designed to function, and
regional efforts toward free-trade agreements have not slowed. Can we
say [Islamic [radicalism]{.mark}]{.underline} was inflamed by the
economic crisis? If it was, that shift [[was clearly overwhelmed
by]{.underline}]{.mark} the Islamic world\'s growing [[disenchantment
with]{.underline}]{.mark} the brutality displayed by violent extremist
groups such as [[al-Qaida]{.underline}]{.mark}. And looking forward,
austere economic times are just as likely to breed connecting
evangelicalism as disconnecting fundamentalism. At the end of the day,
the economic crisis did not prove to be sufficiently frightening to
provoke major economies into establishing global regulatory schemes,
even as it has sparked a spirited \-- and much needed, as I argued last
week \-- discussion of the continuing viability of the U.S. dollar as
the world\'s primary reserve currency. Naturally, plenty of experts and
pundits have attached great significance to this debate, seeing in it
the beginning of \"economic warfare\" and the like between \"fading\"
America and \"rising\" China. And yet, in a world of globally integrated
production chains and interconnected financial markets, such \"diverging
interests\" hardly constitute signposts for wars up ahead. Frankly, I
don\'t welcome a world in which America\'s fiscal profligacy goes
undisciplined, so bring it on \-- please! Add it all up and it\'s fair
to say that this global financial crisis has proven the great resilience
of America\'s post-World War II international liberal trade order. Do I
expect to read any analyses along those lines in the blogosphere any
time soon? Absolutely not. I [[expect]{.mark} the [**fantastic
fear-mongering** to proceed]{.mark}]{.underline} apace. [[That\'s what
the Internet is for]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### No resources mean no war

**Bennett 2K** \-\-\-- D. Scott and Timothy Nordstrom, Professors of
Political Science (Penn State), "Foreign Policy Substitutability and
Internal Economic Problems in Enduring Rivalries," February, Journal of
Conflict Resolution

In this analysis**[,]{.underline}** [we focus on using economic
conditions to understand when rivalries are likely to escalate or
end]{.underline}. Rivalries are an appropriate set of cases to use when
examining substitutability both because leaders in rival states have
clearly substitutable choices and because rivalries are a set of cases
in which externalization is a particularly plausible policy option.7 In
particular, [when confronted [with domestic problems,
leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} in a rivalry [[have]{.mark} the clear
[alternatives of escalating]{.mark} the conflict]{.underline} with the
rival [[to divert]{.underline}]{.mark} attention
[[or]{.mark}]{.underline} to work to [[settle]{.mark}]{.underline} the
rivalry [[as a means of freeing up]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[substantial]{.underline} amount of [[resources]{.mark} that can be
directed [to]{.mark}ward solving [internal
problems]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In the case of the diversion
option, rivals provide logical, believable actors for leaders to target;
the presence of a clear rival may offer unstable elites a particularly
inviting target for hostile statements or actual conflict as necessary.
The public and relevant elites already consider the rival a threat or
else the rivalry would not have continued for an extended period; the
presence of disputed issues also provides a casus belli with the rival
that is always present. Rivals also may provide a target where the
possible costs and risks of externalization are relatively controlled.
If the goal is diversion, leaders willwant to divert attention without
provoking an actual (and expensive)war. Over the course of many
confrontations, rival states may learn to anticipate response patterns,
leading to safer disputes or at least to leaders believing that they can
control the risks of conflict when they initiate a new confrontation. In
sum, rivals provide good targets for domestically challenged political
leaders. This leads to our first hypothesis, which is as follows:
*Hypothesis 1*: Poor economic conditions lead to diversionary actions
against the rival. [Conflict [settlement is]{.mark}]{.underline} also
[[a distinct route]{.mark} to dealing with internal problems that
leaders in rivalries may pursue [when faced with]{.mark} internal
[problems]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Military
[competition]{.mark}]{.underline} between states [[requires]{.mark}
large amounts of [resources]{.mark}]{.underline}, and rivals require
even more attention. [Leaders may choose to negotiate a settlement that
ends a rivalry to free up important resources]{.underline} that may be
reallocated to the domestic economy. [[In]{.mark} a "guns versus butter"
world of economic [trade-offs, when a state can no longer]{.mark} afford
to [pay]{.mark} the expenses associated with competition in a rivalry,
[it is]{.mark} quite [rational]{.mark} for leaders [to]{.mark} reduce
costs by [end]{.mark}ing [a rivalry]{.mark}. This gain]{.underline} (a
peace dividend) [could be achieved at any time]{.underline} by ending a
rivalry. [However, [such]{.mark} a gain [is likely]{.mark} to be most
important and attractive to leaders [when internal conditions are
bad]{.mark} and the leader is seeking ways to alleviate active problems.
[Support]{.mark} for policy change away from continued rivalry
[is]{.mark} more [likely to develop when]{.mark} the [economic situation
sours]{.mark} and elites and masses are looking for ways to improve a
worsening situation. It is at these times that [the pressure to
cut]{.mark} military investment [will be grea]{.mark}test and that state
leaders will be forced to recognize the difficulty of continuing to pay
for a rivalry]{.underline}. Among other things, this argument also
encompasses the view that the cold war ended because the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics could no longer compete economically with the United
States. *Hypothesis 2*: [Poor economic conditions increase the
probability of rivalry termination**.**]{.underline} Hypotheses 1 and 2
posit opposite behaviors in response to a single cause (internal
economic problems). As such, they demand a research design that can
account for substitutability between them.

#### Governments buffer damages, safety nets work, and empirics prove

**Zakaria 9** (Fareed, Ph.D. in Political Science -- Harvard University
and Editor -- Newsweek International, "The Secrets of Stability",
Newsweek, 12-21, Lexis)

One year ago, the world seemed as if it might be coming apart. The
global financial system, which had fueled a great expansion of
capitalism and trade across the world, was crumbling. All the
certainties of the age of -globalization\--about the virtues of free
markets, trade, and technology\--were being called into question. Faith
in the American model had collapsed. The financial industry had
crumbled. Once-roaring emerging markets like China, India, and Brazil
were sinking. Worldwide trade was shrinking to a degree not seen since
the 1930s. Pundits whose bearishness had been vindicated predicted we
were doomed to a long, painful bust, with cascading failures in sector
after sector, country after country. In a widely cited essay that
appeared in The Atlantic this May, Simon Johnson, former chief economist
of the International Monetary Fund, wrote: \"The conventional wisdom
among the elite is still that the current slump \'cannot be as bad as
the Great Depression.\' This view is wrong. What we face now could, in
fact, be worse than the Great Depression.\" Others predicted that these
economic shocks would lead to political instability and violence in the
worst-hit countries. At his confirmation hearing in February, the new
U.S. director of national intelligence, Adm. Dennis Blair, cautioned the
Senate that \"the financial crisis and global recession are likely to
produce a wave of economic crises in emerging-market nations over the
next year.\" Hillary Clinton endorsed this grim view. And she was hardly
alone. Foreign Policy ran a cover story predicting serious unrest in
several emerging markets. Of one thing everyone was sure: nothing would
ever be the same again. Not the financial industry, not capitalism, not
globalization. One year later, how much has the world really changed?
Well, Wall Street is home to two fewer investment banks (three, if you
count Merrill Lynch). Some regional banks have gone bust. There was some
turmoil in Moldova and (entirely unrelated to the financial crisis) in
Iran. Severe problems remain, like high unemployment in the West, and we
face new problems caused by responses to the crisis\--soaring debt and
fears of inflation. But [overall, things look nothing like they did in
the]{.underline} 19[**30s**. The [predictions of economic]{.mark} and
political [collapse have **not materialized**]{.mark} at all. A key
measure]{.underline} of fear and fragility [is the ability of
poor]{.underline} and unstable [countries to borrow money]{.underline}
on the debt markets. [So consider this: the]{.underline} sovereign
[bonds of]{.underline} tottering [Pakistan have returned 168
percent]{.underline} so far [this year]{.underline}. All
[this]{.underline} doesn\'t add up to a recovery yet, but it [does
reflect a return to]{.underline} some level of [normalcy]{.underline}.
And [that rebound has been]{.underline} so [rapid]{.underline} that even
the shrewdest observers remain puzzled. \"The question I have at the
back of my head is \'Is that it?\' \" says Charles Kaye, the co-head of
Warburg Pincus. \"We had this huge crisis, and now we\'re back to
business as usual?\" This revival did not happen because markets managed
to stabilize themselves on their own. Rather, [[governments]{.mark},
having learned the lessons of the Great Depression, were determined not
to repeat the same mistakes]{.underline} once this crisis hit. [By
[massively expanding]{.mark} state [support]{.mark}]{.underline} for the
economy\--[through central banks and national treasuries\--they
[**buffered** the worst]{.mark} of the [damage]{.mark}]{.underline}.
(Whether they made new mistakes in the process remains to be seen.) The
[extensive [social safety nets]{.mark}]{.underline} that have been
established across the industrialized world also [[cushioned]{.mark} the
pain]{.underline} felt by many. [Times are]{.underline} still [tough,
but things are nowhere near as bad as in the]{.underline}
19**[30s]{.underline}**, when governments played a tiny role in national
economies. It\'s true that the massive state interventions of the past
year may be fueling some new bubbles: the cheap cash and government
guarantees provided to banks, companies, and consumers have fueled some
irrational exuberance in stock and bond markets. Yet these
[rallies]{.underline} also [demonstrate the return of confidence, and
confidence is a very powerful economic force]{.underline}. When John
Maynard Keynes described his own prescriptions for economic growth, he
believed government action could provide only a temporary fix until the
real motor of the economy started cranking again\--the animal spirits of
investors, consumers, and companies seeking risk and profit. Beyond all
this, though, I believe [there\'s a fundamental reason why we have not
faced global collapse in the last year. It is the same reason that [we
weathered the]{.mark} stock-market [crash of]{.mark}]{.underline}
19[**[87]{.mark}**, the [recession of]{.mark}]{.underline}
19[**[92]{.mark}**, the [Asian crisis]{.mark} of]{.underline} 19[**97**,
the [Russian default]{.mark} of]{.underline} 19[**98**, [and]{.mark} the
[tech-bubble collapse]{.mark} of]{.underline} 20[**00**.
[The]{.mark}]{.underline} current [[global economic system is
**inherently**]{.mark} **more [resilient]{.mark}** than we think. The
world today is [characterized by]{.mark}]{.underline} three [[major
forces for stability]{.mark}, each [reinforcing the
other]{.mark}]{.underline} and each historical in nature.

#### 2008 crushes their impact

**Drezner, 12** (Professor International Politics Tufts University, '12
(Daniel, October, "The Irony of Global Economic Governance: The System
Worked" Council on Foreign Relations International Institutions and
Global Governance)

In looking at outcomes, [the obvious question is [how well the]{.mark}
global [economy]{.mark} has recovered from the 20[08]{.mark}
crisis]{.underline}. The current literature on economic downturns
suggests two factors that impose significant barriers to a strong
recovery from the Great Recession: [it was triggered by a financial
crisis and it was global in scope]{.underline}. Whether measuring
output, per capita income, or employment, [financial crashes trigger
downturns that last longer]{.underline} and have far weaker recoveries
than standard business cycle downturns.10 Furthermore, [the global
nature of the crisis makes it extremely difficult for countries to
export their way out of the problem]{.underline}. Countries that have
experienced severe banking crises since World War II have usually done
so when the global economy was largely unaffected. That was not the case
for the Great Recession. [The global economy has rebounded much better
than during the Great Depression]{.underline}. Economists Barry
Eichengreen and Kevin O'Rourke have compiled data to compare global
economic performance from the start of the crises (see Figures 1 and
2).11 Two facts stand out in their comparisons. First, [the percentage
drop in global industrial output and world trade levels at the start of
the 2008 financial crisis was more precipitous than the falloffs
following the October 1929 stock market crash]{.underline}. The drop in
industrial output was greater in 2008 nine months into the crisis than
it was eighty years earlier after the same amount of time. The drop in
trade flows was more than twice as large. Second, the post-2008 rebound
has been far more robust. Four years after the onset of the Great
Recession, [global industrial output is 10 percent higher than when the
recession began]{.underline}. In contrast, [four years after the 1929
stock market crash, industrial output was at only two-thirds of
precrisis levels.]{.underline} A similar story can be told with
aggregate economic growth. According to World Bank figures, [global
economic output rebounded in 2010 with 2.3 percent growth]{.underline},
followed up in 2011 with 4.2 percent growth. The global growth rate in
2011 was 44 percent higher than the average of the previous decade. Even
more intriguing, the growth continued to be poverty reducing.12 The
World Bank's latest figures suggest that despite the 2008 financial
crisis, extreme poverty continued to decline across all the major
regions of the globe. And the developing world achieved its first
Millennium Development Goal of halving the 1990 levels of extreme
poverty.13 An important reason for the quick return to positive economic
growth is that [cross-border flows did not dry up after the 2008
crisis]{.underline}. Again, compared to the Great Depression, [trade
flows have rebounded extremely well]{.underline}.14 Four years after the
1929 stock market crash, trade flows were off by 25 percent compared to
precrisis levels. Current trade flows, in contrast, are more than 5
percent higher than in 2008. Even compared to other postwar recessions,
the current period has seen robust crossborder exchange. Indeed, as a
report from CFR's Maurice R. Greenberg Center for Geoeconomic Studies
concluded in May 2012, "[The [growth]{.mark} in world trade
[since]{.mark} the start of [the]{.mark} \[current\] [recovery]{.mark}
[exceeds]{.mark} [even the best]{.mark} of the [prior]{.mark} postwar
[experiences]{.mark}]{.underline}."15 Other cross-border flows have also
rebounded from 2008--2009 lows. Global foreign direct investment (FDI)
has returned to robust levels. FDI inflows rose by 17 percent in 2011
alone. This put annual FDI levels at \$1.5 trillion, surpassing the
three-year precrisis average, though still approximately 25 percent
below the 2007 peak. More generally, global foreign investment assets
reached \$96 trillion, a 5 percent increase from precrisis highs.
Remittances from migrant workers have become an increasingly important
revenue stream to the developing world---and the 2008 financial crisis
did not dampen that income stream. Cross-border remittances to
developing countries quickly rebounded to precrisis levels and then rose
to an estimated all-time high of \$372 billion in 2011, with growth
rates in 2011 that exceeded those in 2010. Total cross-border
remittances were more than \$501 billion last year, and are estimated to
reach \$615 billion by 2014.16 Another salient outcome is mass public
attitudes about the global economy. [[A general
assumption]{.underline}]{.mark} in public opinion research [is that
[during a downturn]{.mark}, demand for greater economic closure should
spike, as [individuals scapegoat foreigners]{.mark} for domestic
woes]{.underline}. [The global nature of the 2008 crisis, combined with
anxiety about the shifting distribution of power, should have triggered
a fall in support for an open global economy]{.underline}. Somewhat
surprisingly, [[however]{.mark}, the reverse is true]{.underline}. Pew's
Global Attitudes Project has surveyed a wide spectrum of countries since
2002, asking people about their opinions on both international trade and
the free market more generally.17 [The [results show]{.mark}
**[resilient support]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} expanding [trade]{.mark} and
business ties with other countries]{.underline}. Twenty-four countries
were surveyed both in 2007 and at least one year after 2008, including a
majority of the G20 economies. Overall, eighteen of those twenty-four
countries showed equal or greater support for trade in 2009 than two
years earlier. By 2011, twenty of twenty-four countries showed greater
or equal support for trade compared to 2007. Indeed, between 2007 and
2012, the unweighted average support for more trade in these countries
increased from 78.5 percent to 83.6 percent. Contrary to expectation,
there has been no mass public rejection of the open global economy.
Indeed, public support for the open trading system has strengthened,
despite softening public support for free-market economics more
generally.18 [The final outcome addresses]{.underline} a dog that hasn't
barked: [[the effect of]{.mark} the Great [Recession on]{.mark}
crossborder [conflict]{.mark} and violence]{.underline}. During the
initial stages of the crisis, multiple [analysts asserted that the
financial crisis would lead states to increase their use of force as a
tool for staying in power]{.underline}.19 [Whether through greater
internal repression, diversionary wars, arms races, or a ratcheting up
of great power conflict, there were genuine concerns that the global
economic downturn would lead to an increase in conflict.]{.underline}
Violence in the Middle East, border disputes in the South China Sea, and
even the disruptions of the Occupy movement fuel impressions of surge in
global public disorder. **[[The aggregate data suggests
otherwise]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however. A fundamental conclusion from
a recent report by the Institute for Economics and Peace is that "[the
average level of [peacefulness in]{.mark} 20[12]{.mark} [is]{.mark}
approximately **[the same]{.mark}** [as]{.mark} it was in
20[07]{.mark}."]{.underline}20 [Interstate [violence]{.mark} in
particular has [declined]{.mark} [since the]{.mark} start of the
[financial crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}---as have military expenditures
in most sampled countries. Other studies confirm that **[the Great
[Recession]{.mark} [has not triggered]{.mark} any increase in [violent
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**; the secular decline in violence that
started with the end of the Cold War has not been reversed.21

Fitch Ratings\' Report: 2015 [Outlook]{.underline}: Global
[Pharmaceuticals]{.underline} (Strategic Industry Evolution to Continue;
M&A Reduces Rating Headroom) here LONDON, December 11 (Fitch) Fitch
Ratings believes 20[[15 will be a transitional year]{.underline}]{.mark}
[for]{.underline} global [pharma]{.underline} [companies as they
continue to evolve their business models]{.underline} and position
themselves for structural changes in the industry. Accordingly, we have
revised the rating outlook to negative as we expected rating headroom
for Fitch-rated pharmaceutical [[companies]{.underline}]{.mark} to
[[remain under pressure]{.mark} in 2015]{.underline}. This is reflected
in the Negative Outlook on 28% of the Fitch-rated global pharma universe
(Amgen, BMS, Merck, Bayer). There was one downgrade in the sector during
2014 (AstraZeneca). Financial flexibility has been eroded during 2014 on
the back of a sharp rise in debt-funded M&A activity as companies focus
on boosting scale in therapeutic areas and consumer healthcare. They are
also improving R&D productivity to manage increasing costs and risks of
bringing new drugs to market. [Fitch\'s [sector outlook remains]{.mark}
[stable]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [reflecting]{.underline}]{.mark} that
**[[underlying long-term growth drivers remain
intact]{.underline}]{.mark}**, characterised by [[an
ageing]{.underline}]{.mark} and growing world
[[population]{.underline}]{.mark} [leading towards]{.underline} an
[[increase]{.mark} of]{.underline} chronic and lifestyle
[[diseases]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[ongoing]{.underline}]{.mark}
emerging-market [[investments]{.mark} in healthcare]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} treatment and [tech]{.underline}nology
[advances]{.underline}. However, we also factor in the intensifying
efforts of healthcare authorities to reduce costs, improve outcomes and
focus on patient value. As a result, we [[expect **stable**]{.mark}
operating [performance]{.mark}]{.underline} [in 2015]{.underline}.
Continued M&A, pressure towards increasing shareholder returns
(particularly for US players), as well as the growing exposure to
potentially rising interest rates as a result of increased debt levels
across the sector are key rating risks. In addition, the industry\'s
focus on scale in selected therapeutic areas over diversification, the
execution and integration of recent corporate activity, as well as risks
and costs bringing the competitive late state R&D pipeline to market may
lead to pressures on the business risk profile of individual players. In
aggregate, we expect global pharma sector to continue to display a
strong investment grade credit profile, [[supported by]{.mark}
favourable underlying demographics]{.underline}, [[emerging market
growth]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and anticipated innovation in [specialist
treatment]{.mark} areas]{.underline}, with rating underpinned by strong
and above average profitability and cash generation. Fitch believes that
stretched rating profiles could be repaired assuming a careful focus on
capital allocation in the sector. The full report, \'2015 Outlook:

#### No impact -- media and pharma hype benefits

**Huff 9** \[E. Huff, staff writer, Natural News, 12-16-2009

[[Doctors and researchers]{.mark} are beginning to
[question]{.mark}]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[[outlandish
claims]{.underline}]{.mark}** [being [made by the
media]{.mark}]{.underline} in response to alleged breakthroughs in
cancer research. In an editorial published in the Journal of the
National Cancer Institute (JNCI), several doctors expressed concern that
[news pieces]{.underline} [fail to accurately reflect]{.underline} [the
truth concerning drugs and scientific studies.]{.underline} Drs. Lisa
Schwartz and Steven Woloshin from the Center for Medicine and the Media
at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice in
New Hampshire, along with Dr. Barnett Kramer from JNCI, examined media
claims about a new anti-cancer drug called olaparib that was reported on
in the acclaimed New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Though the
study was uncontrolled and preliminary, some sources were claiming it as
the most important cancer breakthrough in ten years. Another report
exaggerated study findings concerning alcohol and cancer risk. In
response to a study that showed a two-percent increase in breast cancer
risk from drinking one alcoholic beverage a day versus not drinking at
all, one media source produced a headline that said, \"A drink a day
raises a women\'s risk of cancer\", with no mention of the important
details in the article. Perhaps a simple oversight, [the [coverage
failed to]{.mark} accurately [assess the truth]{.mark}]{.underline} and
may have needlessly scared readers concerning alcohol consumption.
[Coverage concerning]{.underline} [[pharma]{.mark}ceutical

**[[omitted]{.underline}]{.mark}** from the results
[[while]{.underline}]{.mark} miniscule [[benefits]{.underline} [are
highlighted]{.underline}]{.mark} [[as
breakthroughs]{.underline}]{.mark}. The intensity and rate of severe
negative side effects from pharmaceutical drugs is routinely left out of
mainstream reports concerning drug study results.

However, [the current drug development system]{.underline} also
[produces a lot of market abnormalities]{.underline}, in the sense that
[pharmaceutical [companies won't produce certain drugs because
it]{.mark} just [doesn't make **financial sense**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Instead, [the focus is on creating drugs where there is a large target

Think about this from the perspective of a chief executive or

convinced that you're on to something really big]{.underline}. [The
easiest way to understand these market abnormalities is]{.underline} the
current situation now, where [[we]{.mark} simply [weren't prepared for a

[that]{.underline} can [take]{.underline} an unknown amount of
[time]{.underline} [and pose challenges]{.underline} [all
along]{.underline}, [any one of which could scuttle the entire
enterprise,]{.underline} Ross said. It starts out with the basic,
fundamental research of understanding what the disease is, how it works
and how it might be counteracted. If those stages are successful and
researchers have an idea of a way to attack the disease, they have to
test it on animals to see whether it works at all, and whether it\'s
safe. Before a treatment or vaccine can be tested on living humans,
scientists must conduct two rounds of research on human cells and
tissue, first for safety and then for effectiveness. If all of that is
successful, a drug company then has to get approval from the Food and
Drug Administration and regulators in other countries to sell the
product, which can take years. During those painstaking steps,
researchers and drugmakers always have to think about money. \"It costs
millions of dollars to do human trials,\" Ross said. \"[[Even if you
have a drug that is effective]{.underline}]{.mark}, it really sometimes
comes down to the economics of it. [[If it]{.mark}\'s going to
[cost]{.mark}]{.underline} you way [[more]{.underline}
[than]{.underline} [what a person can afford]{.underline}]{.mark},
they\'re not going to be able to manufacture it,\" Ross said.

[[Our team agreed]{.mark} on]{.underline} two [assumptions]{.underline}

defense [budget will not]{.mark} significantly
[increase]{.mark}]{.underline} in the near term. We must emphasize that
these assumptions do not necessarily reflect our beliefs about whether
the United States might intervene in a crisis. Some of us firmly believe
the United States will come to Taiwan's diplomatic, economic, and even
military aid. Similarly, [[we have]{.underline} **[no

[support]{.mark} necessary [to increase]{.mark} Taiwan's [defense

of [[our recommendations]{.underline} **[are

deterrence means it is better to plan for the worst---and then adjust

way around.

Chinese at bay]{.underline}**.

No one needs to hear this message more than the Taiwanese themselves. In
my trips to Taiwan, I have made a point of tracking down and
interviewing both conscripts and career soldiers. Their pessimism is
palpable. This morale crisis in the ranks partly reflects the severe
mismanagement of the conscription system, which has left even eager
Taiwanese patriots disillusioned with their military experience.

But just as important is the lack of knowledge ordinary Taiwanese have
about the strength of their islands' defenses. A recent poll found that
65 percent of Taiwanese "have no confidence" in their military's ability
to hold off the PLA. Absent a vigorous campaign designed to educate the
public about the true odds of successful military resistance, the
Taiwanese people are likely to judge the security of their island on
flawed metrics, like the diminishing number of countries that maintain
formal relations with Taipei instead of Beijing. The PLA's projected
campaign is specifically designed to overwhelm and overawe a demoralized
Taiwanese military. The most crucial battlefield may be the minds of the
Taiwanese themselves. Defeatism is a more dangerous threat to Taiwanese
democracy than any weapon in China's armory.

[Both [Westerners and Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}ese [[should be more
optimistic]{.mark} about the defense of Taiwan than is now normal.
Yes,]{.underline} the [[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}ese Army
[[projects]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[it can only hold off its enemy
for two weeks]{.underline}]{.mark} after the
landing---[**[but]{.underline}** [the PLA]{.underline}]{.mark} [also
[believes]{.mark} that [if it cannot defeat]{.mark} the
[Taiwan]{.mark}ese forces [in under two weeks, **it will lose**]{.mark}
**the war!**]{.underline} [Yes, [the disparity]{.mark} between
the]{.underline} military [budgets]{.underline} on both sides of the
strait [[is large, and growing]{.mark}---[**but** the
Taiwanese]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[do not need parity]{.mark} to deter
Chinese aggression]{.underline}**. **[[All they need is]{.mark} the
[freedom to purchase]{.mark} the sort of [arms that make invasion

Two recent studies, one by Michael [[Beckley]{.underline}]{.mark}, a
political scientist at Tufts University, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
other by Ian [[Easton]{.underline}]{.mark}, a fellow at the Project 2049
Institute, in his book The Chinese Invasion Threat: Taiwan's Defense and
American Strategy in Asia, [[provide]{.underline}]{.mark} us with [a
clearer picture of]{.underline} what a [war between Taiwan and the
mainland]{.underline} might look like. [Grounded in]{.underline}
**[[statistics]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[training
[manuals]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[planning
[documents]{.mark}]{.underline}** from the PLA itself, [and informed
by]{.underline} **[[simulations and studies]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[conducted by]{.underline} **[both]{.underline}** the U.S.
[Defense]{.underline} Department [and]{.underline} the
[Taiwan]{.underline}ese Ministry of National Defense, [[this]{.mark}
research [presents a]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[very different picture
of]{.mark} a cross-strait [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[than]{.mark} that [hawked]{.mark} by the party]{.underline}'s official
announcements.

[[Chinese commanders]{.underline} **[fear]{.underline}**]{.mark} [they
may be forced into armed contest with [an enemy]{.mark} that
is]{.underline} **[[better trained]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[better
[motivated]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[better
[prepared]{.mark}]{.underline}** for the rigors of warfare [than troops
the PLA could throw against them. A cross-strait [war looks **far
less**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[like]{.mark} an inevitable
[victory]{.mark} for China [than]{.mark}]{.underline} it does **[[a
staggeringly risky gamble]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Chinese army documents imagine that this gamble will begin with
missiles. For months, the PLA's Rocket Force will have been preparing
this opening salvo; from the second war begins until the day the
invasion commences, these missiles will scream toward the Taiwanese
coast, with airfields, communication hubs, radar equipment,
transportation nodes, and government offices in their sights.
Concurrently, party sleeper agents or special forces discreetly ferried
across the strait will begin an assassination campaign targeting the
president and her Cabinet, other leaders of the Democratic Progressive
Party, officials at key bureaucracies, prominent media personalities,
important scientists or engineers, and their families.

The goal of all this is twofold. In the narrower tactical sense, the PLA
hopes to destroy as much of the Taiwanese Air Force on the ground as it
can and from that point forward keep things chaotic enough on the ground
that the Taiwan's Air Force cannot sortie fast enough to challenge
China's control of the air. The missile campaign's second aim is
simpler: ~~paralysis~~ \[delaying action\]. With the president dead,
leadership mute, communications down, and transportation impossible, the
Taiwanese forces will be left rudderless, demoralized, and disoriented.
This "shock and awe" campaign will pave the way for the invasion proper.

This invasion will be the largest amphibious operation in human history.
Tens of thousands of vessels will be assembled---mostly commandeered
from the Chinese merchant marine---to ferry 1 million Chinese troops
across the strait, who will arrive in two waves. Their landing will be
preceded by a fury of missiles and rockets, launched from the Rocket
Force units in Fujian, Chinese Air Force fighter bombers flying in the
strait, and the escort fleet itself.

Confused, cut off, and overwhelmed, the Taiwanese forces who have
survived thus far will soon run out of supplies and be forced to abandon
the beaches. Once the beachhead is secured, the process will begin
again: With full air superiority, the PLA will have the pick of their
targets, Taiwanese command and control will be destroyed, and isolated
Taiwanese units will be swept aside by the Chinese army's advance.
Within a week, they will have marched into Taipei; within two weeks they
will have implemented a draconian martial law intended to convert the
island into the pliant forward operating base the PLA will need to
defend against the anticipated Japanese and American counter-campaigns.

This is the best-case scenario for the PLA. But [[an island]{.mark}
docile and [defeated]{.mark} two weeks after D-Day]{.underline} **[[is
not]{.mark} a [guaranteed]{.mark} outcome]{.underline}**. [[One of
the]{.underline} **[central hurdles]{.underline}**]{.mark} [facing the
offensive is [surprise. The PLA]{.mark} **simply [will not have
it]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The invasion will happen in April or October.
[[Because of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [challenges posed by the strait's
[weather, a]{.mark}]{.underline} transport [[fleet can only make it
across]{.mark} the strait [in **one of**]{.mark} **these [two four-week
windows]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [[scale]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
invasion [[will]{.mark} [be so large]{.mark}]{.underline} that strategic
[[surprise]{.underline} **[will not be possible]{.underline}**,
[especially given]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline}
**[[extensive]{.underline}]{.mark}** mutual [penetration of]{.underline}
each side by the other's [[intelligence]{.mark} agencies]{.underline}.

[Easton estimates]{.underline} that [Taiwan]{.underline}ese,
[America]{.underline}n, [and Japan]{.underline}ese [[leaders will
know]{.underline}]{.mark} that [the PLA is preparing]{.underline} for a
cross-strait war **[more than [60 days before]{.mark}
hostilities]{.underline}** begin. [They will know for
certain]{.underline} that [an invasion will happen]{.underline} **[more
than 30 days]{.underline}** [before the first missiles]{.underline} are
fired. [[This will give]{.underline}]{.mark} the [Taiwan]{.underline}ese
[**[ample time]{.underline}** [to move]{.underline}]{.mark} much of
their **[[c]{.underline}]{.mark}**ommand [[and]{.underline}
**[c]{.underline}**]{.mark}ontrol infrastructure [[into]{.underline}
**[hardened]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[mountain
[tunnels]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [move]{.underline}]{.mark} [their

[detain]{.underline}]{.mark} suspected agents and intelligence

the econ]{.mark}omy [on war footing, and distribute weapons
to]{.mark}]{.underline} [Taiwan's]{.underline} **[[2.5 million]{.mark}
reservists]{.underline}**.

[[There are]{.underline} **[only]{.underline}** [13
beaches]{.underline}]{.mark} on Taiwan's western coast that [[the PLA
could]{.mark} **possibly**]{.underline} [[land at.
Each]{.underline}]{.mark} of these [[has]{.underline}]{.mark} **[already
[been prepared]{.mark}]{.underline}** for a potential conflict. [Long
underground [tunnels]{.mark}]{.underline}---complete [[with]{.underline}
**[hardened]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[, subterranean supply
[depots]{.mark}]{.underline}**---[[crisscross the
landing]{.underline}]{.mark} sites. [[The berm]{.mark} of
each]{.underline} beach [[has]{.mark} been covered with **[razor-leaf
plants]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Chemical treatment plants are
common]{.underline} in many beach towns---meaning that [[invaders must

[bombing]{.underline} on their part [will release]{.underline}. [This
is]{.underline} how [things]{.underline} stand [in times of
peace]{.underline}.

[As war approaches, [each beach will be turned into
a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[workshop of horrors]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
The path from these beaches to the capital has been painstakingly
mapped; once a state of emergency has been declared, [[each
step]{.underline}]{.mark} of the journey [will be **complicated or
[booby-trapped]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [PLA war manuals warn

U.S. President Donald [[Trump]{.mark} had a "lengthy"]{.underline}
telephone [conversation with]{.underline} Chinese President
[Xi]{.underline} Jinping on Thursday night [and [agreed to honor the
"one China" policy]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to a press statement
by the White House.

"President Donald J. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China had a
lengthy telephone conversation on Thursday evening," the press release
stated. "The two leaders discussed numerous topics and President Trump
agreed, at the request of President Xi, to honor our 'one China'
policy."

The statement went on to add that "Representatives of the United States
and China will engage in discussions and negotiations on various issues
of mutual interest. The phone call between President Trump and President
Xi was extremely cordial, and both leaders extended best wishes to the
people of each other's countries. They also extended invitations to meet
in their respective countries."

"President Trump and President Xi look forward to further talks with
very successful outcomes," it said.

[Relations between China and the U.S. appeared to get off on the wrong
foot after]{.underline} president-elect [Trump held a]{.underline}
10-minute telephone [conversation with]{.underline} Taiwanese President
[Tsai]{.underline} Ing-wen on Dec. 2, the first such conversation
between a Taiwanese president and an elected American president since
the U.S. severed official diplomatic relations with the Republic of
China (Taiwan) in 1979. Weeks later, [Trump again "angered" Beijing by
telling an interview that the U.S.' "one China" policy was
negotiable]{.underline}, comments that suggested the possibility of both
closer engagement with Taiwan and apprehensions that Taiwan's status,
and U.S. assistance to the democratic island-nation, could also be used
as a bargaining chip during negotiations between Washington and Beijing.

President [Trump's assurances to]{.underline} President [Xi follow a
statement by]{.underline} U.S. Secretary of State Rex
[Tillerson]{.underline} earlier this month [that that the Three
U.S.-China Joint Communiqués, the]{.underline} Taiwan Relations Act
([TRA]{.underline}) [and the Six Assurances constitute the foundations
of U.S. policy toward China and Taiwan. Tillerson added that the U.S.
should continue to uphold its "one China policy,"]{.underline} in which
the U.S. acknowledges Beijing's position that there is only one China
and that Taiwan is part of China.

[[While vague, the White House statement]{.mark}'s reference
to]{.underline} President [Trump's agreeing to honor
**our**]{.underline} --- that is, the U.S.' --- ["one China" policy
[should be **sufficient to please Beijing** while **reassuring Taipei**
that Washington has no intention to revise its official position, such
as adopting]{.mark} the more definitive language contained in [Beijing's
"one China" **principle**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although Mr. Trump's
apparent (and not entirely unexpected) shift toward continuity may
disappoint the more impatient segment of Taiwan's green camp who were
hoping for a break with the longstanding status quo, [[his
decision]{.underline}]{.mark} to do so [[should **dispel fears in
Beijing** and remove]{.mark} some of the [incentives]{.mark} it had [for
punishing Taiwan]{.mark}. By doing so,]{.underline} President
[[Trump]{.mark} may therefore have [**removed some of the variables**
that could have contributed to instability]{.mark} in the Taiwan Strait
at a time when Washington is still fleshing out its policies for the
wider Asia Pacific]{.underline}.

#### No Taiwan invasion 

**Babones 15** Salvatore Babones is an associate professor of sociology
& social policy at the University of Sydney, Foreign Policy in Focus,
March 12, 2015, "Is China a threat? The Devil's in the details",
http://salvatorebabones.com/is-china-a-threat/

What about regional conflict? [China's growing military]{.underline}
certainly [sounds like a regional menace.]{.underline}
**[But]{.underline}** a menace **[to whom?]{.underline}** Here again the
details get in the way of the China threat story.

To the east, Japan's government is responding to Chinese expansion by
boosting its own defense spending to record levels, proposing to change
its pacifist constitution to allow greater military flexibility, and
making a renewed push to resolve the long-standing Kuril Islands dispute
with Russia. If Prime Minister Shinzo Abe finally succeeds in making
peace with Russia, that would leave China and its ally North Korea as
the sole focus for Japan's entire military capacity. Japan is a rich,
technologically advanced country of 127 million people. It can look
after itself.

For very different reasons, China poses little threat to South Korea.
China increasingly views North Korea more as a burden than as an advance
column for an attack on the South. And China has recently been courting
South Korean technology investment in order to reduce its dependence on
Japan.

Political relations across the Taiwan Strait are inevitably dominated by
questions over the status of Taiwan. **[Every election in Taiwan sparks
talk about]{.underline}** and fears of **[Chinese invasion. But [no
country]{.mark} in the world [has staged a large]{.mark}-scale
[amphibious assault since]{.mark}]{.underline}** the U.S. landings at
Incheon, South Korea in **[19[50]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [For more than
half a century, even American adventures abroad have been
small-scale]{.underline} (Grenada) [or launched from land
bases]{.underline} (Iraq).

**[[The Chinese military will never have the capacity]{.mark} to invade
Taiwan against armed resistance]{.underline}** --- **[not now, not
later, not ever. [It]{.mark} just [can't be done]{.mark} in the
contemporary military context]{.underline}** [in which
[a]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[single]{.mark} cruise [missile can sink
a]{.mark} transport [ship carrying]{.mark} [thousands]{.mark} of
troops]{.underline}**. [[It]{.mark} makes no sense to worry about
something that [is]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[not]{.mark} technically
[possible]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The Philippines? Why would China want to invade the Philippines?
Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar? Ditto, ditto, ditto. [China is involved in a
plethora of minor border disputes with its neighbors, but none of these
involve core territorial interests or serious legal claims that
China]{.underline} (or most of its neighbors, for that matter) [have
historically been interested in pushing.]{.underline} They're all frozen
conflicts that are unlikely ever to thaw.

### China/Taiwan\-\--Ext\-\--No Invasion

#### No Taiwan invasion -- too difficult and economic ties 

**Thim 15** Michal Thim is a Ph.D. candidate in the Taiwan Studies
Program at the China Policy Institute (CPI), University of Nottingham, a
CPI blog Emerging Scholar, and a Research Fellow at the Prague-based
think-tank Association for International Affairs, Thinking Taiwan,
January 21, 2015, "Can China Take Over Taiwan by Force?",
http://thinking-taiwan.com/can-china-take-taiwan-by-force/

However, **[[taking Taiwan]{.mark} by force [presents a great]{.mark}er
[challenge]{.mark} for the]{.underline}** modernizing **[PLA than most
observers assume.]{.underline}**

To begin with, **[[geographical conditions are favorable
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** the defense of
**[[Taiwan]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This may appear incredible, since
geographically Taiwan lacks strategic depth since its entire territory
is within range of PLA's advanced combat jets and cruise and ballistic
missiles. However, [[Taiwan's]{.mark} rugged [coastline lacks
suitable]{.mark} landing [beaches]{.mark} and [its mountainous landscape
offers]{.mark} natural defensive [advantages, especially given]{.mark}
the [weather]{.mark} conditions in the Strait. If defended by a
determined population]{.underline}, **[[Taiwan can be quite
inhospitable]{.mark} to any external power attempting to
land]{.underline}** its **[forces.]{.underline}**

Three scenarios are most frequently considered for possible use of force
by China against Taiwan.

Air/[missile [strikes]{.mark}]{.underline}

The first scenario involves missile and air strikes against key military
and civilian infrastructure, including government buildings,
communication nodes, ports, and airports. Those would aim to cripple air
defenses, the Navy and communication systems, while blinding defenders
and subjecting the political leadership to "shock and awe." Beijing
would thus hope to force Taipei to accept China's terms without a costly
invasion.

This is arguably a tempting option for Beijing. It has many benefits for
the attacker: rapid, decisive action with minimal losses, resulting in
the opponent's surrender. Hence, it is commonly held that should Beijing
decide to use force, missile strikes would be the preferred option.
Proponents of this scenario argue that in recent conflicts, air strikes
(including use of guided missiles) proved decisive, forcing opponents to
surrender without the need to conduct ground operations. NATO's
intervention against Serbia in 1999 is sometimes cited as an example.
However, this **[[assumes]{.mark} nearly [perfect
execution]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the plan, and as Von Moltke once
observed "No campaign plan survives first contact with the enemy."
Moreover, NATO's Kosovo campaign took nearly three months of sustained
bombardment before Belgrade capitulated and withdrew from Kosovo.

Air power's importance rose prominently throughout the 20th and into
21st century, but [careful examination of individual cases
reveals]{.underline} that **[[air forces have
never]{.underline}]{.mark}** truly **[[won]{.mark} conflicts [on their
own.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[Even in the face of]{.mark} considerable
[losses, there would be no guarantee]{.mark} that the [Taiwan]{.mark}ese
government [would]{.mark} simply [surrender]{.mark} without PLA boots on
the ground.]{.underline} Further, while the Second Artillery Corps may
field over 1,600 ballistic missiles, it is limited by the number of
launching platforms it possesses, allowing it to fire "only" a few
hundred missiles in each wave. Even that would be a feat that the PLA
has never performed.

Moreover, **[[Taiwan is preparing]{.mark} extensively]{.underline}** for
this scenario, [[establishing]{.mark} rapid runway [repair capability,
redundant communication]{.mark} infrastructure, [and underground
bases]{.mark}, all designed to survive a first strike.]{.underline} Some
of the expensive platforms that have been criticized as a waste of
resources have potentially great value in preventing the effects of
"shock and awe." The long-range early-warning radar at Leshan in Hsinchu
County will buy additional time, while a missile defense centered on the
U.S.-made Patriots and Taiwan's Tien-Kung III, although doomed to
destruction in the process, will limit the impact of a first strike. The
psychological effect of images of successful interceptions could provide
balance to the destruction caused by airborne and land-based missiles.
Beijing's hope that Taiwan would quickly surrender therefore does not
rest on a strong foundation.

Naval blockade/quarantine

A naval blockade is often regarded as a viable option for Beijing. The
PLA Navy (PLAN) has benefitted greatly from ongoing modernization, with
the recent introduction of new submarines and guided missile destroyers.
A naval blockade (likely called a quarantine by Beijing, implying action
within its territory rather than blocking a sovereign nation) is that it
could be a relatively bloodless action, with the exception of likely
exchanges between the Taiwanese Navy and the PLAN. The disadvantage is
that [naval [blockades lack efficiency]{.mark} and take time. Moreover,
[they are logistically]{.mark} [complex]{.mark} if the goal is total
isolation]{.underline}. The PLAN, undergoing transformation from an
offshore navy to ocean-going navy, is wanting in experience in
exercising this type of sea-control. Moreover, a blockade would be a
prolonged effort that lacks the advantage of surprise. [[Should a
blockade fail]{.mark} to persuade Taiwanese leaders to give up, [the PLA
would have]{.mark} to strike against [alerted
defenders]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Amphibious assault

An **[[amphibious invasion is]{.underline}]{.mark}** the most radical
option of all, and it is also in many ways **[[a poor option]{.mark} for
Beijing.]{.underline}** However, given the problems with the first two
options, this measure appears ultimately necessary if Taiwan is to be
incorporated into the People's Republic of China. Currently, [[the PLA
is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[still [far from]{.mark} having sufficient
[capacity to land]{.mark} forces and reinforce them with sufficient
manpower to secure a beachhead.]{.underline}** [The element of [surprise
would be a challenge because]{.mark} of the [necessary
preparations]{.mark} resulting in concentration of transport
ships]{.underline} and the PLA troops in civilian ports in proximity to
Taiwan.

The first phase would be similar to the missile and air attack scenario,
except that this time there would be a continuous action aimed at
achieving complete control of the sea and air and destruction of
Taiwan's key assets on the ground. This is a necessary condition before
attempting to traverse the unkind waters of the Taiwan Strait in slow,
vulnerable, troop-carrying landing ships. Moreover, [even with the sea
and air secured, the danger of [lurking mobile]{.mark} land-based
anti-ship [missiles would remain]{.mark}.]{.underline} Finally, the
conditions of **[Taiwan's coastline would make it easy for Taiwan's
defense planners]{.underline}** to determine where the landings could
take place. If Beijing's preferred option is a quick victory, an
amphibious attack does not offer it.

Ultimately, Beijing would prevail, perhaps even if the U.S. intervenes.
However**[, the [cost of victory would inevitably be
high.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[China is no longer the China]{.mark} of
the 1950s, [when it could]{.mark} send [hundreds of thousands]{.mark} of
volunteers [to die]{.mark}]{.underline}, as it did in the Korean War.
This time [its soldiers would be the only sons or daughters of parents
who are reluctant to see them die.]{.underline} **[[The CCP's
attempt]{.mark} to consolidate its power by "returning"
Taiwan]{.underline}** to China's bosom **[[could]{.mark} very well
[backfire and mark the end]{.mark} of its rule.]{.underline}**

Chinese generals also face an additional dilemma: Whether to strike
against U.S. bases in Japan to take them out pre-emptively, gaining
additional time before Washington can dispatch new forces to the area,
or refrain from striking in the hope that the U.S. will not intervene.
The former option makes the U.S. (and Japanese) intervention a
certainty, while the latter gives the U.S. the initiative with its bases
intact.

Possible assistance to Taiwan in the case of a cross-Strait conflict is
understandably a thorny issue, and Washington keeps its intentions
deliberately ambiguous. However, while preventing the forceful seizure
of Taiwan by China is too important for the U.S. (and even more so for
Japan), assistance to Taiwan does not have to take the form of a
full-scale intervention. The U.S. could limit itself to providing
real-time intelligence or supplying war materials to Taipei. Though U.S.
intervention should not be taken for granted, by the same token, it
would be unwise to underestimate the value of Taiwan for Washington and
Tokyo.

Though the most feasible, the three scenarios outlined above do not
cover all the cards that Beijing has at its disposal. Two other options
have been discussed lately: "Salami-slicing" and "Crimea-style"
scenarios.

Salami-slicing

Some observers argue that Beijing is already using the salami-slicing
method in the South China Sea, taking assertive steps that are not
provocative enough to prompt a forceful reaction. In a Taiwan scenario,
the PLA could opt for a phased invasion divided into three stages, using
the time between respective stages to break Taiwan's will to resist. The
first stage would begin with the occupation of Kinmen and Matsu, two
island groups near the Chinese coast. The second stage would be aimed at
seizing the Penghu islands in the middle of the Strait, while the third
stage would constitute the final attempt to take Taiwan proper if
negotiations failed to convince Taipei of the futility of resistance. It
is a possible though not optimal option, one that entails the loss of
the element of surprise and prolonged operations, which Beijing does not
appear to find palatable. However, seizing part of the territory
governed by Taipei may be enough to satisfy Beijing's short-term
intentions. In fact, the time span between the respective stages could
involve years. The ultimate downside of such action is that after the
first move, Taiwan's population would never again trust any "goodwill"
moves by Beijing.

Crimea-style/hybrid warfare

The Crimea-style/hybrid warfare scenario, with "little green men"
operating behind enemy lines, gives the intruder plausible deniability
and is a tempting option. However, there is crucial element missing in
the case of Taiwan: widespread local support. **[[Support for
unification is extremely low]{.mark} in Taiwan.]{.underline}** Even if
we take into consideration that a United Front could mobilize manpower
within Taiwan and manufacture perceptions of higher support, the
emergence of an armed militia to protect "Chinese citizens" from the
"separatist" central government in Taipei is hardly conceivable. This
option is likely feasible only for Kinmen and Matsu, where both local
support and ease of resupply is possible. The relevance for a Taiwan
scenario lies not in the tactics used by Moscow in Crimea, but in the
blatant disregard for Taiwan's sovereignty.

[China does not have many options for a rapid victory.]{.underline} Its
best bet is to strike hard and hope that united front efforts and
asymmetrical economic interdependence will do the rest. However, a
United Front, relying on pro-Beijing sympathizers, will likely fade in
strength once missiles start to fly. Economic leverage and exploiting
cross-strait integration are arguably also part of the United Front's
arsenal. However, if economic factors alone could compel Taiwanese to
accept Beijing's rule, no use of force would be needed. In other words,
use of force would ultimately mean that Beijing failed to absorb Taiwan
by other means.

If a quick victory is out of reach, Beijing may still consider a
prolonged costly campaign with amphibious invasion as the ultimate
option. However, the longer the campaign, the more problematic it will
become. Naturally, these are not all the options. Beijing may also
choose to use a combination of individual elements for each scenario
(e.g., a naval blockade and seizure of offshore islands).

Special Forces deployed in Taiwan prior to the outbreak of hostilities
to strike at key targets, kidnap or kill political leaders, and secure
airstrips for the PLA's airborne soldiers is another option. This is a
more traditional version of "little green men" deployment and presumably
part of larger military operations. However useful Special Forces may
be, their greatest utility lies in their ability to conduct hit-and-run
operations, not holding ground awaiting relief. Arguably, Beijing could
simultaneously land its airborne forces in some of the regular
cross-strait flights and perhaps sneak-in military transport planes
carrying armored personnel vehicles or light tanks for greater mobility
and firepower, but further resupply would become difficult once Taiwan's
armed forces are alerted. Nevertheless, Beijing may opt for Special
Forces reinforced by airborne troops to maximize the element of
surprise, destroy key infrastructure, seize key government buildings,
and quickly install a puppet government. If successful, it would
undoubtedly become the greatest operation of its kind in history.

Cyber warfare

One last option that has not been mentioned so far is cyber warfare. For
example, large-scale cyber-attacks could damage the electric power grid,
resulting in considerable economic losses for Taiwan. However, as an
asymmetrical method, cyber war does not give Beijing the qualitative and
quantitative advantages found in the previous options. Taiwan could
retaliate with its own offensive cyber campaign, since the advantage
that China enjoys in traditional military power would be irrelevant. In
any case, cyber attacks would be part of each of the above outlined
options, differing only in scale, adding a new element to the
traditional three domains (land, air, sea) of war.

\* \* \*

What else is missing in the equation? Discussing strategic, tactical,
and operational aspects, comparing capabilities and outlining scenarios
of their use notwithstanding, the will to resist is a crucial aspect of
armed conflict, essential part for weaker actors to prevail over
stronger. It is also one that is inherently difficult to assess prior to
the outbreak of hostilities. Taiwan's conscript-based armed forces have
not received much credit in that respect. Young Taiwanese are often
criticized for being too soft and comfortable, and unwilling to face
hardship. As if this were not enough, the loyalty of their commanders
has been called into question by the seemingly endless string of arrests
for espionage for the China. However, everything would change after the
first shot is fired. Recall that the famous "this house will not fight
for King and Country" resolution at the Oxford Union in 1933. Six years
later, when war broke out, undergrads at Oxford flocked to volunteer.

Thus, along with military options, non-military scenarios should be
considered. [Numerous observers often echo a sentiment that is
recurrently shared by general public: Beijing would not need to fire a
single shot to take over Taiwan.]{.underline} **[[Economic
interdependence would tie hands]{.mark} of even the most determined
government]{.underline}** in Taiwan. Furthermore, [[the prospect
of]{.mark} economic [breakdown should Taiwan refuse]{.mark} to follow
[Beijing]{.mark}'s dictates [would be enough]{.mark} for a majority of
Taiwanese to do Beijing's bidding.]{.underline} That could happen
despite the fact that nations have historically resisted rather than
surrender.

#### China won't invade

**Keck 13** (Zachary Associate Editor at The Diplomat "Why China Won\'t
Attack Taiwan" 12/24 The Diplomat
<http://thediplomat.com/2013/12/why-china-wont-attack-taiwan/>)

Although relatively muted in recent years, [Taiwan is seen as the
great]{.underline}est [potential flashpoint]{.underline} in U.S.-China
relations. Indeed, U.S. defense analysts perceive China's expanding
Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) capabilities primarily through the lens
of preventing the U.S. from intervening should Beijing invade Taiwan.
Consequently, [the main concepts the U.S. military has developed for
countering A2/AD]{.underline} --- namely, Air-Sea Battle and a blockade
approach --- [appear to be based on the assumption]{.underline} that a
shooting [war with China would break out over Taiwan.]{.underline}

In many ways, the concern over Taiwan is well-placed. China covets the
island far more than any other piece of real estate, including the
Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands. For CCP leaders and many ordinary Chinese,
Taiwan is one of the vast remaining vestiges of the country's century of
humiliation. Acquiring Taiwan would also significantly enhance the PLA's
ability to project power outwardly. Despite improvements in cross-Strait
relations in recent years, China has refused to rule out the possibility
of invasion.

Besides having the motivation to acquire Taiwan, China seemingly is
rapidly acquiring the capability to take the island by force. In recent
years, the cross-Strait military balance has rapidly shifted in
Beijing's favor, and this trend is almost certain to continue so long as
China's economy continues to grow. Today, China has at least 1,600
ballistic missiles pointed at Taiwan, and Taiwan's own Ministry of
Defense admits that China will have sufficient military capabilities to
mount a full cross-Strait attack by 2020.

This has led some U.S. analysts, particularly academics of the Realist
persuasion, to argue that the U.S. should gradually cede Taiwan to the
People's Republic of China. For example, Charles Glaser argued in a
controversial Foreign Affairs article in 2011 that, given the risks of
nuclear war between China and the United States, "the United States
should consider backing away from its commitment to Taiwan. This would
remove the most obvious and contentious flash point between the United
States and China and smooth the way for better relations between them in
the decades to come."

Similarly, in a recent talk in Taiwan, John Mearsheimer argued that
short of acquiring an independent nuclear deterrent, Taiwan's best
option is to pursue the "Hong Kong strategy" toward Beijing. Under the
Hong Kong strategy, "Taiwan accepts the fact it is doomed to lose its
independence and become part of China. It then works hard to make sure
that the transition is peaceful and that it gains as much autonomy as
possible from Beijing."

Although the trend lines are undoubtedly working in China's favor, [[it
is]{.underline}]{.mark} ultimately **[[extremely
unlikely]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [[China will try to
seize]{.underline} [Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark} [by force]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [should it try]{.underline} to do this, [it is unlikely to
succeed.]{.underline}

[Even assuming China's military capabilities are great enough to prevent
the U.S. from intervening]{.underline}, [there are]{.underline} [two
forces]{.underline} that [would]{.underline} likely [be sufficient to
deter China from invading Taiwan]{.underline}. The first and least
important is the dramatic impact this would have on how countries in the
region and around the world would view such a move. Globally, [[China
seizing Taiwan would result in]{.underline} [it
being]{.underline}]{.mark} [permanently [viewed as]{.mark}]{.underline}
a [[malicious]{.underline}]{.mark} nation. Regionally, [China's
invasion]{.underline} of Taiwan [would diminish any]{.underline}
[lingering debate over how Beijing will use its]{.underline} growing
[power]{.underline}. [Every]{.underline} regional [power would see its
own fate in Taiwan]{.underline}. Although [Beijing would try to reassure
countries]{.underline} by claiming that Taiwan was part of China
already, and thus the operation was a domestic stability one, [this
narrative would be convincing to none]{.underline} of China's neighbors.
Consequently, [[Beijing would face an]{.mark} [environment in which each
state]{.mark} was dedicated to]{.underline} cooperating with others to
[[balance against Chinese power.]{.underline}]{.mark}

But [the more important deterrent]{.underline} for China [would be the
uncertainty of success]{.underline}. To be sure, China's military
capabilities are growing to the point where it will soon be assured of
its ability to quickly defeat Taiwan's military forces. A little longer
down the road it will also likely be confident that it can prevent the
U.S. from intervening in the conflict.

However, [as]{.underline} [recent]{.underline} U.S. military
[conflicts]{.underline} have adequately [demonstrated]{.underline},
[[being able to defeat a]{.mark}nother [nation's]{.mark} armed
[forces]{.mark} [and]{.mark}]{.underline} [[being]{.underline} [able to
pacify the country]{.underline} [are two different
things]{.underline}]{.mark} altogether. It is in this latter aim that
[[China's strategy]{.mark} [is likely to falter]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Taiwanese are adamantly opposed to]{.mark} being incorporated into a
non-Democratic [China]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[These]{.mark} [feelings
would]{.mark}]{.underline} [[only]{.underline}
[harden]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the]{.underline} aftermath of the
[invasion]{.underline}.

Thus, even if it quickly defeated Taiwan's formal military forces, the
[[PLA would]{.mark} continue to have to [contend with
the]{.mark}]{.underline} remnants of [[resistance for years]{.mark} to
come]{.underline}. Such a scenario would be deeply unsettling for
leaders in Beijing as this [[defiance would]{.underline}]{.mark} likely
[[inspire]{.underline}]{.mark} similar [[resistance
among]{.underline}]{.mark} various [[groups on the
mainland]{.underline}]{.mark}, starting first and foremost with ethnic
minorities in the western China. Should the PLA resort to harsh
oppression to squash resistance in Taiwan, this would deeply unsettle
even Han Chinese on the mainland. In fact, the clear parallels with how
Imperial Japan sought to pacify Taiwan and China would be lost on no one
in China and elsewhere.

[The entire situation would be a nightmare for]{.underline} Chinese
[[leaders]{.underline}]{.mark}. Consequently, [they
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} nearly **[[certain to avoid]{.mark} [provoking
it]{.mark}]{.underline}** by invading Taiwan. [The only real
scenario]{.underline} in which they would invade Taiwan [is if
the]{.underline} island [nation formally]{.underline} [declared
independence]{.underline}. But if [Taiwanese leaders have avoided doing
so]{.underline} to date, they are unlikely to think the idea is very
wise as China goes stronger.

Thus, [[the status-quo]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Taiwanese strait [[is
unlikely to be changed]{.underline}]{.mark} by military force. Instead,
Beijing is likely to continue drawing Taiwan closer economically, and
seeking to disrupt the U.S.-Taiwanese bilateral relationship. The hope
would be that leaders in Taipei will ultimately conclude that they
cannot resist being absorbed into China, something China itself can
facilitate this by offering favorable terms.

### China/US\-\--1NC

Graham [Allison]{.underline}\'s April 12 article, "How America and China
Could Stumble to War," [explores how misperceptions and]{.underline}
bureaucratic [dysfunction could accelerate]{.underline} a militarized
[crisis]{.underline} involving the United States and China
[into]{.underline} an unwanted [war]{.underline}. However, [the
article]{.underline} fails to persuade because it [neglects]{.underline}
the **[key]{.underline}** [political and geostrategic
conditions]{.underline} that make war plausible in the first place.
[Without]{.underline} those [conditions in place]{.underline}, the [risk
that a crisis could accidentally escalate]{.underline} into war
**[becomes far lower]{.underline}**. The [U.S.-China]{.underline}
[[relations]{.underline}]{.mark}hip today [[may]{.underline}]{.mark} be
[[trend]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[to]{.underline}]{.mark}wards greater
[[tension, but]{.mark} the]{.underline} [**[relative
stability]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and overall]{.underline} **[low level
of hostility]{.underline}** [[make]{.underline}]{.mark} the prospect of
an [[accidental]{.underline}]{.mark} escalation to [[war]{.underline}
**[extremely unlikely]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

In a series of scenarios centered around the South China Sea, Taiwan and
the East China Sea, Allison explored how well-established flashpoints
involving China and the United States and its allies could spiral into
unwanted war. Allison's article argues that given the context of
strategic rivalry between a rising power and a status-quo power,
organizational and bureaucratic misjudgments increase the likelihood of
unintended escalation. According to Allison, "the underlying stress
created by China's disruptive rise creates conditions in which
accidental, otherwise inconsequential events could trigger a large-scale
conflict." This argument appears persuasive on its surface, in no small
part because it evokes insights from some of Allison's groundbreaking
work on the organizational pathologies that made the Cuban Missile
Crisis so dangerous.

However, [Allison]{.underline} ultimately [fails to persuade because he
fails to specify]{.underline} the [political and strategic conditions
that make war]{.underline} [plausible]{.underline} in the first place.
[Allison]{.underline}'s analysis [implies]{.underline} that the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and China are in a
situation analogous to]{.underline} that of the Soviet Union and the
United States in the early 1960s. In [the Cold War]{.underline} example,
the two countries faced each other on a near-war footing and engaged in
a bitter geostrategic and ideological struggle for supremacy. The two
countries experienced a series of militarized crises and fought each
other repeatedly through proxy wars. It was this broader context that
made issues of misjudgment so dangerous in a crisis.

**[By contrast]{.underline}**, the [U.S.-China relations]{.underline}hip
today [operate]{.underline}s [at a **much lower level of hostility and
threat**]{.underline}. [[China and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [may
be experiencing]{.underline} an increase in [tensions]{.underline},
**[but]{.underline}** [the two]{.underline} countries
[[remain]{.underline} **[far from the bitter]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[,
acrimonious [rivalry]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[that
defined]{.mark}]{.underline} the [U.S.-[Soviet]{.mark}
[relations]{.mark}]{.underline}hip in the early 1960s. [Neither
Washington nor Beijing regards the other as its principal
enemy]{.underline}. Today's [rivals]{.underline} may view each other
warily as competitors and threats on some issues, but
[[they]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[view each other as]{.mark}
important]{.underline} [**[trade partners]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} [partners on]{.underline}]{.mark} some **[shared
[concerns]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [such as]{.underline} North [Korea, as
the recent summit between]{.underline} President Donald [Trump
and]{.underline} Chinese president [Xi]{.underline} Jinping
[illustrated]{.underline}. The [[behavior of]{.underline}]{.mark} their
respective [[militaries]{.mark} [underscores]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[relatively [restrained]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[rivalry]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [military
[competition]{.mark}]{.underline} between China and the United States
may be growing, but it [[operates]{.mark} at a **[far
lower]{.mark}**]{.underline} [level]{.underline} of intensity
[[than]{.underline}]{.mark} the relentless [[arms racing that
typified]{.mark} the]{.underline} U.S.-[[Soviet standoff]{.mark}.
And]{.underline} unlike their Cold War counterparts, [U.S. and Chinese
[militaries]{.mark} [are not postured to fight]{.mark}]{.underline} each
other in major wars. [[Moreover, polls show]{.underline}]{.mark} that
the [[people]{.underline}]{.mark} of the two countries [[regard each
other with mixed views]{.underline}]{.mark}---[a]{.underline}
**[considerable contrast]{.underline}** [from the hostile sentiment
expressed by]{.underline} the [U.S. and Soviet publics]{.underline} for
each other. **[[Lacking]{.underline}]{.mark}** both
[[preparations]{.mark} for major war [and a constituency]{.mark} for
conflict, [leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} and bureaucracies in both
countries [[have]{.underline} **[less incentive]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} **[misjudge]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[crisis
[situations]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in favor of **unwarranted**
escalation]{.underline}.

**[[To the contrary]{.underline}]{.mark}**, political [[leaders]{.mark}
and bureaucracies]{.underline} currently [[face]{.mark} a]{.underline}
[**[strong incentive]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} ]{.mark}[find ways
of [defus]{.mark}ing [crises]{.mark} in a manner]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} **[avoids unwanted escalation]{.underline}**.
[[This]{.mark} inclination [manifested]{.mark} itself [in]{.mark}
the]{.underline} EP-3 [airplane collision]{.underline} off Hainan Island
[in [2001, and]{.mark}]{.underline} in subsequent [incidents
involving]{.underline} U.S. and Chinese [ships and
aircraft]{.underline}, such as the harassment of the USNS Impeccable [in
200**[9]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This does not mean that there is no
risk, however. Indeed, the potential for a dangerous militarized crisis
may be growing. Moreover, key political and geostrategic developments
could shift the incentives for leaders in favor of more escalatory
options in a crisis and thereby make Allison's scenarios more plausible.
Past precedents offer some insight into the types of developments that
would most likely propel the U.S.-China relationship into a hostile,
competitive one

featuring an elevated risk of conflict.

#### Tensions won't escalate to conflict -- geography, lack of motive, and resilient relations\-- answers China rise, their historical appeals, new weapons, and either US or Chinese-initiated war

What does vital interest plus capability and willingness to challenge or
defend supremacy tell us looking at the [[U.S. and
China]{.underline}]{.mark} through today's periscope?

First of all they [**[do not]{.underline}** [threaten each
other]{.underline}]{.mark}['s vital interest. They are safe. [Geography
makes]{.mark}]{.underline} an [armed [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[impossible]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

[Militarily]{.underline} the [[U.S. enjoys]{.underline}]{.mark} **[a
colossal geographic benefit]{.underline}** [ensconced in [the
West]{.mark}]{.underline}ern Hemisphere [[with no enemies.
Recalling]{.underline}]{.mark} the [time it took]{.underline} and the
drain on [[logistics]{.mark} to move]{.underline} half a million men
[[in]{.mark}to [the Middle East]{.mark}]{.underline} to wage war in 1991
and 2003 a [U.S.]{.underline} military [[attack on China falls
in]{.mark} the category of]{.underline} **[[not
thinkable]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [China is surrounded]{.underline} by
India, Russia, and Japan [with a land border]{.underline} traditionally
[difficult to defend and the sea offering trade]{.underline} routes [as
well as invasion routes. [China's]{.mark}]{.underline} military
[[capability may be growing]{.underline} **[but]{.underline}**
[recalling]{.underline}]{.mark} [necessity to defend]{.underline}
China's [[borders]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [advantages
[geography]{.mark} offer]{.underline} to the [U.S.,
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[starting]{.underline}]{.mark} positions
for measuring [relative]{.underline} military [[power
**any**]{.underline}]{.mark} rational [[analysis
concludes]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[no military
threat]{.underline}]{.mark} to U.S. vital interests **[is
thinkable]{.underline}**. [[Comparing China]{.underline}]{.mark} today
[[to Germany]{.underline}]{.mark} and the U.S. to Britain 100 years ago
[[is]{.mark} fascinating]{.underline}, **[but [not
relevant]{.mark}]{.underline}**. So far, if a comparison is sought,
China is much more akin to Bismarck's Germany moving slowly and weighing
every step fully aware of the balance of power not wishing to upset it
even if striving to enhance its own role.

The Napoleonic wars, the run up to World War I, and the run up to World
War II reveal that the established power and the rising power do not
bump into each other with a bang in the revolving door. In all three
cases a string of negotiations and attempts to find a modus vivendi
dominated the picture.

The Napoleonic Wars included the Revolutionary Wars stretched from the
beginning of the 1790s to 1815, but it was not one long war --- far from
it. There were seven coalitions whereof five from 1803 when Britain
entered the arena in earnest; periods of peace, admittedly unstable,
interrupted war. The question was whether France and Britain could find
out how to live with each other; only when that proved impossible was
the war taken to a battle for supremacy with Britain as the winner.

Prior to 1914 the same pattern is visible. Numerous publications
including Norman Angell's 'The Great illusion' from 1909 classified war
as futile explaining that no advantages or benefits flowed from waging
major wars in an era of strong trade and investment links. The book
influenced British political thinking prior to 1914 and despite rising
tensions with Germany successive governments tried to shape a mutually
acceptable power balance. An example of this maneuvering was the British
proposal in 1912 (the Haldane mission) for a moratorium on battleship
building. It failed for various reasons, but underline that great powers
actually diagnose confrontations and implement policies to prevent them
from escalating.

The appeasement policy pursued by Prime Minister Chamberlain in the late
1930s illustrates the same behavior. He went a long way to see whether
Britain could accommodate Nazi-Germany.

[The]{.underline} by far [[most likely]{.mark} scenario for U.S.-China
relations]{.underline}hip over the next decades [[is]{.mark} continued
[negotiations to]{.mark}]{.underline} **[adjust]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[[adapt]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to]{.underline} [a
new power balance. [There may be skirmishes]{.mark}]{.underline} also of
military character [[but]{.underline}]{.mark} with **[lightning speed
[diplomacy]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[will]{.mark} be mobilized
to]{.underline} [**[contain such]{.mark}** events]{.underline}. [[There
may be]{.mark}]{.underline} armed conflicts using
[[proxies]{.underline}]{.mark} to test each other
**[[but]{.underline}]{.mark}** [kept [under control]{.mark}. In
[new]{.mark} areas such as]{.underline} **[cyber]{.underline}** warfare
[and]{.underline} **[space]{.underline}** ['[rules]{.mark} of
engagement' or 'conduct']{.underline} - written or unwritten - [**[will
be formulated]{.underline}** [as nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark} [weapons
[not]{.mark}]{.underline} [[only introduced MAD]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Mutual Assured Destruction), [[but]{.mark} [also]{.mark} common
[understanding]{.mark}]{.underline} between the U.S. and the Soviet
Union about how to manage the power game under such conditions.
[[Cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} warfare [[and space]{.mark}
may]{.underline} technologically [be new, they **[do
not]{.mark}**,]{.underline} [however, [change]{.mark} the
[parameters]{.mark}]{.underline} of the power game: Measure capability
and willingness of your 'enemy' to threaten vital interests.

[It seems a fair bet to **[rule out]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[major]{.underline} armed [[conflicts in Asia]{.underline}]{.mark} while
a merciless rivalry about trade, investment, money and probably also
societal model will rule the agenda.

### China/US\-\--Ext\-\--No War

#### Chinese military inferiority, economic interdependence, and US alliances

Artyom **Lukin 14**, Professor @ Far Eastern Federal University
(Russia), "Imagining World War III \-- In 2034," 8/4/2014, The World
Post (partnership of the Huffington Post and Berggruen Institute,
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/artyom-lukin/world-war-iii_b_5646641.html>

There are [**three reasons war is unlikely anytime soon**.]{.underline}
[First, despite the double-digit annual growth in its defense budgets,
[China\'s military]{.mark} still [significantly lags behind the
U.S.]{.mark}\']{.underline} It will take China 15 to 20 years to attain
parity or near-parity with the U.S.-Japan allied forces in the East
Asian littoral. [Second]{.underline}, for all the talk of mutual
interdependence, [[China **depends on America**]{.mark} much more than
the other way round. China is still critically reliant on the U.S
[and]{.mark} its [allies,]{.mark} the EU and Japan, [as]{.mark} its
**principal [export markets]{.mark}** []{.mark}and sources of advanced
technologies and know-how. [Overall, China\'s dependence]{.mark} on
international markets [is **very high**]{.mark}, with the trade to GDP
ratio standing at 53 percent. China imports many vital raw materials,
such as oil and iron ore.]{.underline} As most of its commodity imports
are shipped by the sea, [[China would be **extremely vulnerable
to**]{.mark} a **[naval blockade]{.mark}**, which is likely to be
mounted [by the U.S. in]{.mark} case of a major
[conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} Both for economic and strategic reasons,
the Chinese government pursues policies to reduce the country\'s
reliance on foreign markets, trying to shift from an export-oriented
model to domestic sources of growth. It is also making efforts to secure
raw materials in the countries and regions contiguous to China, like
Central Asia, Russia or Burma, so as to reduce dependence on sea-born
shipments. However, at least for the next 15 to 20 years China\'s
dependency on the West-dominated global economic system is going to stay
very significant. [Third, [China would have to confront]{.mark} not the
[U.S.]{.mark} alone but also America\'s Asian [allies, including Japan,
Australia and]{.mark} perhaps [India]{.mark}.]{.underline} Thus China
needs at least one major power ally and some lesser allies. Whether
China dares to pose a serious challenge to the U.S. will, to a large
extent, hinge upon Beijing and Moscow forming a Eurasian geopolitical
bloc. This is already happening now, but it is going to take some more
time. [The bottom line: over the next 15 to 20 years a **[major war in
Asia is highly unlikely because Beijing will be]{.mark} playing a
[cautious]{.mark} game**. [Even if a]{.mark} military [clash does occur,
it will be **short**, with China]{.mark} being [**quickly
routed**]{.mark} by the **preponderant American force**.]{.underline}
However, around 2030 the balance is bound to undergo considerable
changes, if China is successful in: 1) closing military gap with the
U.S.; 2) making its economy less reliant on the Western markets and
overseas raw resources; and 3) forming its own alliance structure.

<http://thediplomat.com/flashpoints-blog/2013/07/12/why-china-and-the-us-probably-wont-go-to-war/>)

But while trade cannot be relied upon to keep the peace, a [[U.S.-China
war is]{.underline} **[virtually unthinkable]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[[because of]{.underline}]{.mark} two other factors: [[nuclear weapons
and geography]{.underline}.]{.mark}

The fact that both the [U.S. and China [have nuclear weapons is the most
obvious reason]{.mark}]{.underline}s why [[they won't
clash]{.underline}]{.mark}, [**[even if]{.underline}** [they
remain]{.underline}]{.mark} [fiercely
[competitive]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} This is because war is the
continuation of politics by other means, and nuclear weapons make war
extremely bad politics. Put differently, [war is fought in pursuit of
policy ends]{.underline}, [which cannot be achieved through]{.underline}
a [total war between nuclear-armed states]{.underline}.

This is not only because of nuclear weapons destructive power. As Thomas
Schelling outlined brilliantly, nuclear weapons have not actually
increased humans destructive capabilities. In fact, there is evidence to
suggest that wars between nomads usually ended with the victors
slaughtering all of the individuals on the losing side, because of the
economics of holding slaves in nomadic "societies."

[What makes nuclear weapons different]{.underline}, then, [is not
just]{.underline} their [destructive power but]{.underline} also the
[certainty and immediacy]{.underline} of it. While extremely ambitious
or desperate leaders can delude themselves into believing they can
prevail in a conventional conflict with a stronger adversary because of
any number of factors---superior will, superior doctrine, the weather
etc.--- none of this matters in nuclear war. With nuclear weapons,
countries don't have to prevail on the battlefield or defeat an opposing
army to destroy an entire country, and [since [there are no adequate
defense]{.mark}s [for]{.mark}]{.underline} a [large-scale [nuclear
attack]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[every leader]{.underline} **[can be
absolute certain]{.underline}**]{.mark} that [most of [their
country]{.mark}]{.underline} [[can be destroyed]{.underline}]{.mark} in
short-order in the event of a total conflict.

Since no policy goal is worth this level of sacrifice, [the only
possible way for]{.underline} an all-out [conflict to ensue
is]{.underline} for a [[miscalc]{.underline}]{.mark}ulation of some sort
to occur. [Most of these [can]{.mark}]{.underline} and should [[be dealt
by]{.mark} Chinese and the U.S. [leaders holding
regular]{.mark}]{.underline}ly [senior level [dialogues]{.mark}
like]{.underline} the ones of the [past month]{.underline}, in which
frank and direct talk about redlines are discussed.

These can and should be supplemented with clear and open communication
channels, which can be especially useful when unexpected crises arise,
like an exchange of fire between low-level naval officers in the
increasingly crowded waters in the region. While this possibility is
real and frightening, [[it's **hard to imagine** a **plausible
scenario** where it leads to]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[nuclear exchange
between China and]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates.
After all, **[[at each stage]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of the [crisis
leaders know]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[if it is not properly
contained]{.underline}]{.mark}, [a [nuclear war]{.mark} [could
ensue]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} and the [[complete
destruction]{.mark} of a leader's country [is]{.mark}]{.underline} a
**[more [frightening]{.mark}]{.underline}** possibility [[than
losing]{.mark} [cred]{.mark}]{.underline}ibility [[among hawkish]{.mark}
elements of [society]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In any case,
measured means of retaliation would be available to the party wronged,
and behind-the-scenes [diplomacy could]{.underline} help
[facilitate]{.underline} the process of finding mutually acceptable
[retaliatory measures.]{.underline}

[Geography]{.underline} is the less appreciated factor that [will
mitigate]{.underline} the [chances of]{.underline} a [U.S.-China
war]{.underline}, but it could be nearly as important as nuclear
weapons. Indeed, [[geography]{.mark} has a history of allowing countries
to avoid]{.underline} the [Thucydides Trap]{.underline}, [and [works
against]{.mark} a [U.S.-China war]{.mark}]{.underline} [in]{.mark} a
couple of ways.

First, both the United States and China are immensely large
countries---according to the Central Intelligence Agency, the [[U.S. and
China]{.mark} are the third and fourth largest countries in the
world]{.underline} by area, at 9,826,675 and 9,596,961 square km
respectively. They also have difficult topographical features and
complex populations. As such, [they [are **virtually
unconquerable**]{.mark}]{.underline} by another power.

This is an important point and differentiates the current strategic
environment from historical cases where power transitions led to war.
For example, [in]{.underline} Europe where many of the [historical
cases]{.underline} derive from, each [state genuinely had to
worry]{.underline} that [the other side could increase]{.underline}
their [power]{.underline} capabilities to such a degree [that they
could]{.underline} credibly [threaten the other]{.underline}
side['s]{.underline} national [survival]{.underline}. [[Neither China
nor]{.mark} the [U.S. has to realistically
entertain]{.mark}]{.underline} such [[fears]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
[[this will lessen]{.underline}]{.mark} their insecurity and therefore
[the [security dilemma]{.mark}]{.underline} they operate within.

Besides being immensely large countries, [China and the U.S.
are]{.underline} also [separated by]{.underline} the [Pacific
Ocean]{.underline}, [which will]{.underline} also [weaken]{.underline}
their [sense of insecurity]{.underline} and threat perception towards
one another. [In many]{.underline} of the [violent power transitions of
the past]{.underline}, starting with Sparta and Athens but also
including the European ones, the [rival states were located in close
proximity]{.underline} to one another. By contrast, [when great power
conflict has been avoided]{.underline}, [the states have]{.underline}
often [had considerable distance between them]{.underline}, as was the
case for the U.S. and British power transition and the peaceful end to
the Cold War. The reason is simple and similar to the one above: [the
[difficulty of projecting power across large
distances]{.mark}]{.underline}---[particularly]{.underline} bodies of
[water]{.underline}s--- [reduces each side's concern]{.underline} that
the [other will threaten its]{.underline} national
[survival]{.underline} and most important strategic interests.

True, the U.S. operates extensively in China's backyard, and maintains
numerous alliances and partnerships with Beijing's neighbors. This
undeniably heightens the risk of conflict. At the same time, the British
were active throughout the Western Hemisphere, most notably in Canada,
and the Americans maintained a robust alliance system in Western Europe
throughout the Cold War. [Even with the U.S. presence in
Asia]{.underline}, then, [the fact that]{.underline} the [[Chinese and
America]{.underline}]{.mark}n homelands [[are separated
by]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[largest body of water]{.mark} in the world
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[enormously important]{.underline}** [in
reducing]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[conflict
potential]{.underline}]{.mark}, [if history is any guide]{.underline} at
least.

Thus, while every effort should be made to avoid a [U.S.-China
war]{.underline}, it [is nearly unthinkable]{.underline} one will occur.

**[Policy Recommendations]{.underline}**

[Despite Beijing's efforts to undermine the status quo]{.underline} and
achieve the political subordination of Taiwan under its "One China
Principle," [[Washington has managed]{.mark} to foster]{.underline}
**[[robust]{.mark} U.S.-[Taiwan relations]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.
[Notwithstanding]{.underline}]{.mark} its past [[successes, the]{.mark}
current]{.underline} policy [[framework has not kept pace with]{.mark}
fundamental changes]{.underline} that have taken place [in Taiwan, and
[Beijing's]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[increasing
belligerence]{.underline}**]{.mark} towards Taiwan and may not be
sustainable. [A representation]{.underline} that is [more in tune with
the reality on the ground in Taiwan]{.underline}---which takes into
account its transition from authoritarian regime to democracy---[and in
China]{.underline}---[which takes into account its
authoritarianism]{.underline} **[that has become more aggressive
domestically and abroad]{.underline}**---[would allow for a
recalibration of the U.S.-Taiwan relationship **that would be more
conducive to long-term U.S. interests in the region**]{.underline}, [and
more accurately reflect American]{.underline} principles and
[values]{.underline}. Towards that end, the [governments in Washington
and Taipei should consider]{.underline} promoting the following\[5\]:

[(1) Normal, Stable, and Constructive Relations: The]{.underline}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[should]{.underline} **[deepen]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[and
broaden]{.underline}** its [engagement with [Taiwan]{.mark} and
consider]{.underline} ways to move toward a [more normal
[relations]{.mark}]{.underline}hip over the longer term. Taiwan is a
great democratic success story, a thriving economy, and a global leader
in health and science. It stands to contribute greatly as a good citizen
of the world. [The [U.S. should]{.mark}]{.underline} seek to
[[promote]{.underline}]{.mark} opportunities for
[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark} to participate meaningfully [[in]{.mark}
international [organizations]{.mark}, and resist pressure to isolate
Taiwan]{.underline} from participating in the cooperative work among
nations in international organizations.

[(2) High-level Exchanges: U.S. [officials]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[at
the highest levels]{.underline}** [should engage]{.underline}]{.mark}
[counterparts in Taiwan on a regular basis [in accordance with the
Taiwan Travel Act]{.mark}.]{.underline} President Donald [[Trump
and]{.underline}]{.mark} President [[Tsai]{.underline}]{.mark} Ing-wen
[[should]{.underline}]{.mark} seek the opportunity to
[[meet]{.underline}]{.mark} each other in person. [[This will]{.mark}
invariably [cause frictio]{.mark}n between Washington and
Beijing]{.underline}, [**[but]{.underline}**
[treating]{.underline}]{.mark} [democratic [leaders with]{.mark} dignity
and [respect is **key**]{.mark} **to a broader strategy.**]{.underline}
[Cabinet]{.underline}-level [officials should regularly
visit]{.underline} their counterparts in Taiwan to discuss national,
departmental, and technical issues of shared interest.
[[Hindering]{.mark} high-level [contacts **encourages
misunderstandings**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[policy
mistakes]{.underline}**, [especially [in]{.mark}]{.underline} times of
[[crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [current level]{.underline} and pace
[of interactions is inadequate]{.underline} for managing the
complexities of a relationship that encompasses issues ranging from
trade to science and technology, and from environmental protection to
defense and security affairs.

[(3) Bilateral Trade Agreement: The]{.underline}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
government [[should negotiate]{.mark} a [free trade]{.mark} agreement
[with Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}, with similar or even better terms
than the ones it already has with South Korea, Singapore, and Australia.
[[Taiwan is]{.underline}]{.mark} an island nation, heavily dependent
upon trade to sustain itself as an economic powerhouse, and it [is
[vulnerable to]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[increasing Chinese]{.mark}
economic [coercion]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [especially
since]{.underline} just in 2018, **[41%]{.underline}** [of
Taiwan's]{.underline} merchandise [exports were to mainland China and
Hong Kong]{.underline}, according to data released by the Congressional
Research Service.\[6\] [This effort]{.underline} will likely occur over
the long term, but it [could have **important payoffs for American
statecraft**]{.underline} [by integrating trade into the calculation of
a comprehensive strategy for great power competition]{.underline}. The
[[U.S. would benefit]{.underline}]{.mark} both **[[economically and
strategically]{.underline}]{.mark}** from a closer trade relationship
with Taiwan.

[(4) Routinize Arms Sales]{.underline}: The United States, as stipulated
under the TRA and reinforced by the recently proposed Taiwan Assurance
Act of 2019, "conducts regular transfers of defense articles to Taiwan
in order to enhance its self-defense capabilities."\[7\] Just in
September 2018, the U.S. State Department approved a \$330 million
military sale to Taiwan.\[8\] However, [regardless of past and
recent]{.underline} practices of arm [sales]{.underline} to Taiwan,
[the]{.underline} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[should routinize]{.mark} the [arms
sale]{.mark} process]{.underline} for addressing Taiwan's requests for
defense articles and services; provide a timely response to requests as
well as commercial export licenses; and base arms sales decisions on
Taiwan's strategic and operational requirements, which are inherently
defensive in nature and serve U.S. interests. In keeping with the terms
of the Reagan's Six Assurances, Beijing should not be consulted in
advance of arms sales to Taiwan.

[(5) People-to-People Exchange]{.underline}: The U.S.
[[State]{.underline}]{.mark} Department [[should
launch]{.underline}]{.mark} a [new]{.underline} initiative to enhance
[[people-to-people exchanges]{.underline}]{.mark} with Taiwan,
especially in the areas of education and culture. The
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates government [should
support]{.underline} the development of more [nonprofit]{.underline}
educational [organizations that encourage]{.underline} **[mutual
understanding]{.underline}** among citizens of the two nations.

[[Adjusting the]{.mark} U.S. [approach]{.mark}]{.underline} toward its
Taiwan policy and cross-Strait relations [to ensure]{.underline} that
[the TRA]{.underline}-created [framework is able to manage the current
and future challenges ahead demands a new approach that
fundamentally]{.underline} **[[extends]{.mark} greater
[legitimacy]{.mark} to democratic Taiwan]{.underline}** politically,
economically, and militarily. [**[Sustained and high-level
discussion]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}
**[needed]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[now more than ever]{.underline}**
before between the United States and Taiwan [[to determine a]{.mark}
[new]{.mark} optimal [equilibrium]{.mark} that best reflects the
objective reality in the Strait]{.underline}.

[[Higher - level contact]{.mark} between U.S. and Taiwan officials
[ought]{.mark} to [occur routinely]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even if
presidential meetings are not possible, [dialogue between leaders should
be facilitated by video conferences and regular correspondence.
[Cabinet]{.mark} - level [visits]{.mark} to Taiwan]{.underline}, five of
which occurred during the Clinton administration alone, [[could quickly
be resumed]{.mark}. The prolonged and ill - considered [hiatus]{.mark}
in those visits during the]{.underline} George W. [Bush and early Obama
years is [self - defeating]{.mark}. Such [trips are important
symbolically]{.mark}]{.underline}, but [[they also improve communication
and raise awareness]{.mark} of common interests]{.underline}. Taiwan's
representatives also should be granted better access to U.S. officials
in Washington and not be barred from buildings such as the Department of
State. There is no formal agreement that requires such restrictions;
they are entirely self - imposed.

### Solves\-\--Deterrence

#### CP is key to [China deterrence]{.underline} and [US resolve]{.underline} -- reactive approaches fail -- [affirmative policy]{.underline} is key

https://www.fpri.org/article/2019/04/the-taiwan-relations-act-at-40-reaching-a-new-optimal-equilibrium-in-u-s-taiwan-policy/

The Taiwan Relations Act ([TRA]{.underline})---passed by the U.S.
Congress in 1979---[has provided an]{.underline} **[enduring framework
for U[.S.-Taiwan relations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This remarkable
legislation mandated special American [obligations and
commitments]{.underline} to Taiwan that [have
[helped]{.mark}]{.underline} to **[[preserve peace]{.mark} and
stability]{.underline}** [in the Taiwan Strait for]{.underline} the past
[40 years]{.underline}. It is also the only legal underpinning of U.S.
policy toward Taiwan. Yet, much as strategic changes necessitated
adjustments in U.S. policy during the Cold War, [**[fundamental
changes]{.mark}** in the]{.underline} circumstances of the [21st
century, as]{.underline} former Deputy Secretary of State Richard
[Armitage said]{.underline} at a Global Taiwan Institute and Project
2049 Institute forum, [[require]{.underline}]{.mark}, at the very least,
**[a ["rethink"\[]{.mark}]{.underline}**1\] [of the U.S.
approach]{.underline} to Taiwan policy and cross-Strait relations.

[To be sure, the U.S.-Taiwan [relationship is]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[stronger now than]{.mark} it has [ever]{.mark} been]{.underline}**
since 1979, so "if it ain't broke, don't fix it," right? Wrong. [[Even
though it is]{.mark} **[not broken]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [Taiwan
policy **needs to be recalibrated**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [While
the]{.underline} U.S.-Taiwan [relationship is **heading in the right
direction**]{.underline}, [the U.S. should start thinking about a
destination]{.underline}. Perhaps most importantly, the [[U.S. needs to
shift]{.mark} from a reactive]{.underline} **[to an [affirmative]{.mark}
policy]{.underline}** to Taiwan.

Recalibrating the Trilateral Relationship

U.S. policy towards Taiwan does not exist in a vacuum. Relations between
Washington and Beijing over the last 40 years have had a
disproportionate influence in how the United States conducted (and
conducts) its informal relations with Taiwan. The current framework for
the trilateral relationship between Washington, Taipei, and Beijing,
which includes the TRA, Six Assurances, Three Communiqués, and the U.S.
"One China" policy, requires recalibration.\[2\]

[While a U.S. and Taiwan policy of maintaining the status quo has helped
to **maintain peace**]{.underline} in the Taiwan Strait [and remains the
best near-term option, it is unsustainable in the long term because
[China is]{.mark} **unceasingly and [aggressively seeking]{.mark}** [to
change the status quo]{.mark} through military and non-military
means]{.underline}. The massive military [[buildup]{.underline}]{.mark}
across the Taiwan Strait by the People's Liberation Army (PLA), the
[Chinese]{.underline} leadership's continued [[refusal to
renounce]{.mark} the use of [force]{.mark} against Taiwan,
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP)
[non-military [coercive pressure are **destabilizing**]{.mark} **the
Strait**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} are **[threatening the peace and
security]{.underline}** [of the Indo-Pacific]{.underline} area.

[[While the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[has managed to deter
Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark} militarily [from taking]{.underline}
destructive military [action against Taiwan]{.underline} over the last
four decades, [[because]{.mark} [Beijing has been]{.mark}]{.underline}
relatively [[weak]{.mark}, the [risks of the]{.mark} U.S. [approach
**inch dangerously close to outweighing**]{.mark} **its
[benefits]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[as the PLA]{.mark} rapidly
[modernizes]{.mark}.]{.underline} Meanwhile, [the [CCP is
**intensifying**]{.mark}]{.underline} [its [political
infiltration]{.mark} and subversion activities]{.underline} through
United Front and other active measures-like campaigns to affect the
social and economic systems of Taiwan. [As the PLA grows stronger, a
[perceived lack of commitment]{.mark} that the U.S. will intervene
in]{.underline} defense of [Taiwan]{.underline}, which is [shared [in
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[and other countries]{.mark} in the
region]{.underline}**, [[could weaken morale]{.mark} in Taiwan
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} **[further [embolden Beijing]{.mark} to use
force to resolve the Taiwan issue]{.underline}**. [Public perceptions
and [misperceptions to]{.mark}ward [arms sales]{.mark} and economic
ties, [as well as]{.mark}]{.underline} the continuation of the
[U.S]{.underline}. policy of [[strategic ambiguity]{.mark} have [fueled
such attitudes]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[However]{.underline}**,
[this]{.underline}]{.mark} [perceived [lack of commitment is
unfounded]{.mark} as the U.S. has repeatedly shown]{.underline}, through
legislation, arms sales, Global Cooperation and Training Framework
(GCTF) initiatives, the free and open Indo-Pacific strategy, and many
other projects and activities, that [it values Taiwan]{.underline}'s
freedom and democracy.

[If [Washington and Taipei]{.mark} continue their [reactive]{.mark}
approach]{.underline} toward Beijing's unilateral challenges to the
status quo, it [[can lead to **greater instability**]{.mark}
in]{.underline} the [Taiwan Strait]{.underline}. [**[Greater
clarity]{.mark} of U.S. commitments** to defend Taiwan, coupled with
demonstrative commitments by Taiwan]{.underline} to its own
self-defense, **[[is critical]{.mark} for purposes of deterrence and
stability]{.underline}**.

\*\*\*Modified for language

[U.S. policy]{.underline} towards Taiwan over the past 40 years [has
operated on the premise that America's]{.underline} primary [interest
is]{.underline} in [the process---as opposed to the outcome---of
resolving differences between the two sides of]{.underline} the
[Taiwan]{.underline} Strait. There is wide latitude for policymakers
within the United States and Taiwan to work within the existing legal
and policy framework, but [a]{.underline} **[[necessary]{.mark}
foundation]{.underline}** [[to]{.mark} ensure]{.underline} the
sustainability of [[peace]{.underline}]{.mark} over time [[is]{.mark}
an]{.underline} **[affirmative policy of [soft
balancing]{.mark}]{.underline}** [by the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.

[By design, U.S. policy was **inherently reactive**]{.underline} [and
intentionally ceded]{.underline} the initiative of shaping [the ultimate
outcome to the two other parties]{.underline}. It was an approach that
some senior U.S. policymakers, at the time that the policy was conceived
in the 1970s, expected would create a fait accompli, and one that would
provide Washington with the flexibility to respond to broader
geopolitical challenges of the Cold War with the Soviet Union while
maintaining stability in the Strait.

Despite some expectations to the contrary, [Taiwan **thrived** in the
ensuing four decades]{.underline}. The government liberalized from the
top down while an active civil society fervently pushed for political
reforms from the bottom up. Taiwan evolved from an authoritarian regime
to a vibrant democracy. As a consequence, support for Taiwan and its
democracy grew within the United States as well.

**[Yet]{.underline}**, [the **[growing power disparity]{.mark}** between
Taipei and Beijing [and]{.mark}]{.underline} a [protracted]{.underline}
practice of **[[undue deference]{.underline}]{.mark}** [by [Washington
to Beijing's]{.mark} [sensitivities has]{.mark} **gradually
[eroded]{.mark} some of the original [commitments]{.mark}
made**]{.underline} [[under the TRA and]{.underline}]{.mark} President
Ronald [[Reagan's]{.mark} Six [Assurances]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[3\]
These Assurances include, perhaps most importantly, maintaining the U.S.
position of not taking a position on the issue of sovereignty over
Taiwan, no prior consultation with Beijing on arms sales to Taiwan, and
no attempt to pressure Taiwan to enter into negotiations with the PRC,
among other measures.

[[As]{.mark} the power [disparity]{.mark} between Taiwan and China

**[increasing the risk of]{.mark} military

The PRC's coercive pressure campaign is aimed at gradually and
unceasingly pushing for its own desired outcome: ending the sovereignty
of a democratically elected government and the freedom of its 23 million
people by unifying Taiwan into the PRC. All the while, [the [current
approach may be]{.mark} inadvertently drawing the]{.underline}

[Indeed, [some]{.mark}]{.underline} American scholars and former
policymakers have [[floated the]{.underline} **[alarming
idea]{.underline}**]{.mark} that [[the U.S. needs to accommodate
China]{.underline}]{.mark} by reaching a new modus vivendi with
Beijing---[which would have the U.S. effectively abandon
Taiwan]{.underline}.\[4\] [This]{.underline} **[flawed
view]{.underline}** [is based on a tendency to construct events in the
Taiwan Strait in binary terms]{.underline}---either [independence or
unification]{.underline}---and for Beijing, the only option is
unification, even if it means going to war. **[But]{.underline}** [[U.S.
policy]{.underline}]{.mark} [**[should not]{.underline}**
[accept]{.underline}]{.mark} [the assertion that cross-Strait relations
pose [such a Hobson's choice]{.mark}.]{.underline}

An Affirmative Vision

Despite Washington's and Taipei's pragmatic approach,
[[Beijing's]{.mark} approach is [becoming]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[more
coercive]{.mark}, unilateral, [and]{.mark} increasingly
[detrimental]{.mark}]{.underline}** to U.S. interests.

The [[U.S. needs]{.mark} to adopt]{.underline} **[a more
affirmative]{.underline}** [Taiwan policy that not only insists on a
peaceful process]{.underline}, **[but also provides [an
alternative]{.mark} substantive [vision]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark}, at the very least, [[reflects]{.mark} the
**objective [reality]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that two legitimate,
mutually non-subordinate political entities coexist across the Taiwan
Strait.]{.underline}

[This would entail a significant]{.underline}, **[but
marginal]{.underline}**, [change]{.underline} in U.S. policy, and a

[alternatives]{.underline} to such change [present]{.underline}

Thus, [the changing international structure **foretells a competitive
dynamic**]{.underline} [between the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
China]{.underline}. China's suspicions of U.S. motives and intentions
are structurally-driven, just as U.S. suspicions of China are driven by
the same structural conditions. Uncertainty about intentions is a
built-in characteristic of an anarchic system, generating the security
dilemma and mutual distrust.

[How]{.underline}, then, [does Taiwan fit into this? [In]{.mark} the
context of [U.S.-China]{.mark} security
[competition]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[Washington will
have]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[strong [incentives to]{.mark} ramp up
security [coop]{.mark}eration [with Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
order [to contain]{.underline} the growth of [Chinese
power]{.underline}.

First, Taiwan's geostrategic location is of particular value to U.S.
national security interests. The island controls the sea lines of
communication (SLOCs) extending from Japan to Southeast Asia and serves
as a check on China's maritime expansions into the East and the South
China Seas.

**[If Washington wishes to maintain its preeminent position in Asia, it
is in the U.S. interest to include Taiwan]{.underline}** (along with
Japan, South Korea, and other allies) [in its overall Asia strategy. [It
makes]{.mark} good strategic [sense]{.mark} for the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[[to]{.mark} help
[strengthen Taiwan's defense]{.mark} capabilities]{.underline}** in
order to deter Beijing from attacking the island. Strong U.S.-Taiwan
security ties ameliorate the power asymmetry across the Taiwan Strait
and thereby increase the costs of China's military coercion.

Second, [[defending Taiwan is]{.underline} **[linked
to]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the [cred]{.mark}ibility [of the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates for [protecting allies]{.mark} and
partners in Asia]{.underline}**. If Washington abandons Taiwan, Beijing
would likely view the concession as a weakening of U.S. resolve for
protecting other interests in Asia. Seeing the United States as a "paper
tiger," China might become more aggressive in pursuing territorial
interests in maritime Asia.

Moreover, [[abandoning Taiwan would]{.underline} **[reduce allies'
confidence]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**in the credibility of U.S. security
commitment** to them. At a time [when]{.mark} Asian
[states]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[need the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
to counterbalance Chinese power]{.underline}**, [a U.S. decision [to
abandon Taiwan would be]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**particularly
alarming**, sending]{.underline} **[shock waves]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[across the region]{.underline}**.

[Based on shared strategic interests, [realism
anticipates]{.mark}]{.underline} that [the]{.underline}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[will [coopera]{.mark}te with Taiwan]{.underline}** to thwart China
from dominating Asia. [[Washington is]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[currently]{.underline}** [[taking measures to]{.underline}
**[upgrade]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[U.S.-Taiwan
[relations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In early 2018, [Congress passed [the
Taiwan Travel Act]{.mark}, which [encourages]{.mark}]{.underline}

to]{.underline} three [Latin American [countries]{.mark}]{.underline}
(El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama) [[for

China]{.underline}. [Going forward]{.underline}, **[[U.S. support of

#### Credibility of security commitments key to prevent allied prolif -- academic literature review, policy-maker intuition, qualitative analysis, paired-case analysis, and previous quantitative work

[**[Recent]{.mark} academic [research]{.mark}**
[suggests]{.mark}]{.underline} that [policymakers' [intuition]{.mark}
about the efficacy of security]{.underline} [assurances [is
**correct**]{.mark}]{.underline}; on average, nuclear [security
assurances decrease an ally's likelihood of exploring, pursuing, and
acquiring nuclear weapons]{.underline}.5 But, while [policymakers and
analysts appear to be correct that **[security assurances]{.mark} can
[prevent allied proliferation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, much less is known
about why some security assurances succeed and others fail. Many have
put forth prescriptions meant to increase the effectiveness of U.S.
security assurances, but little scholarship has rigorously theorized and
tested these. 6 Without this knowledge, U.S. attempts to stem allied
proliferation through security assurances may be suboptimal or, in the
worst case, might even backfire. In addition to being policy relevant,
the question of what makes security assurances effective in preventing
allied proliferation also presents an interesting academic puzzle. In
cases such as the United Kingdom immediately following World War II,
South Korea, Sweden, and Japan, the United States provided security
assurances to varying degrees of effect. In some cases, the assurances
were very effective in preventing proliferation (i.e. Japan), whereas in
others, they appear to have had less of an impact (i.e. South Korea in
the 1970s).7 This puzzle -- why assurances were more effective at
preventing allied proliferation in some circumstances than others -- has
yet to be fully analyzed in the academic literature. To address this gap
in our understanding, [this article uses qualitative methods to help
policymakers and academics better understand why assurances
succeed]{.underline} -- or fail -- [in preventing allied nuclear
proliferation. **[Building on previous quantitative
work]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[showing]{.mark} that assurances **can
prevent [such]{.mark} proliferation**]{.underline},8 [[this article
takes]{.mark} this [research]{.mark} a **step
[further]{.mark}**]{.underline} [by [asking why]{.mark} security
[assurances were more effective]{.mark} at preventing allied
proliferation in some cases than others]{.underline}. To answer this
question, [we analyze two cases of allied proliferation]{.underline}:
[South Korea]{.underline} in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s [and the United
Kingdom]{.underline} immediately following World War II. [By [using a
paired comparison]{.mark}]{.underline} of these cases, [[we
explore]{.mark} [when]{.mark}]{.underline} [security [assurances
succeeded]{.mark} in preventing allied]{.underline} [proliferation
activity (in the 1980s in South Korea) and when they failed (in South
Korea in the 1970s]{.underline} and in the United Kingdom after World
War II). [Our research suggests]{.underline} that [certain
[factors]{.mark}]{.underline} **[do [increase]{.mark} the
[likelihood]{.mark} that security [assurances]{.mark} will
[prevent]{.mark} allied [nuclear proliferation]{.mark}]{.underline}**.9
[The [ally's **perception of**]{.mark} **the [credibility]{.mark} of the
patron's assurance [is extremely important;]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in
both cases, South Korean and British perceptions of the credibility of
the assurance]{.underline} [-- and the robustness of the overall
relationship -- played a **major role**]{.underline} [in their
proliferation decisions. The [logic is
**straightforward**]{.mark}]{.underline}[: [if the ally
believes]{.underline}]{.mark} [that the assurance is credible and that
[the patron is committed]{.mark} to the ally's security, **[it will be
less likely to engage]{.mark} in proliferation activity.**]{.underline}
[[As]{.mark} both South [Korea and the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[K]{.underline}]{.mark}**ingdom [[feared]{.mark} that the United
States was becoming less invested in their security, [they
increased]{.mark} their [proliferation]{.mark} activity]{.underline}.
**[[Only when]{.mark} [the ally began to perceive]{.mark} that [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [was firmly invested]{.mark} in its
security [did it curb]{.mark} its [proliferation]{.mark}
activity.]{.underline}**

### A2: Taiwan/US Relations Low\-\--Process

#### [Consultations now]{.underline} \-\-- we're [meeting demand]{.underline} for extended deterrence now

**Roberts 16** (Brad, William J. Perry Fellow in International Security,
Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, former Deputy
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear and Missile Defense Policy,
*The Case for U.S. Nuclear Weapons in the 21^st^ Century*, 2016, pp.
201-204)

It is important to acknowledge that the [[new initiatives]{.mark} to
cooperate in this area]{.underline} in 2009 [[built on **solid
foundations**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the prior decade, Japan and the
United States had broken significant new ground in developing
cooperative approaches to missile defense, while also taking some
initial steps to discuss nuclear deterrence in the new strategic
environment. Similarly, [the Republic of Korea and the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [had renewed the two-plus-two
framework]{.underline} (a process of alliance coordination involving
ministries of defense and foreign affairs and their U.S. counterparts)
with an eye to strengthening deterrence of North Korea.¶ The
[[consultations]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2009 [[focused]{.mark} heavily
[on **U.S. declaratory policy**]{.mark}]{.underline} and on U.S.
capabilities for extended nuclear deterrence. On declaratory policy, the
[Obama]{.underline} administration [carefully considered the views of
its allies in Northeast Asia]{.underline} (and elsewhere) [before
rejecting the "sole purpose formulation]{.underline}" and modifying the
negative security assurance. The "sole purpose formulation" would have
reduced the role of nuclear weapons in U.S. deterrence strategy to the
sole purpose of deterring nuclear attack on the United States or its
allies, thereby eliminating their role in deterring attacks on vital
interests by other means, including chemical and biological weapons and
large-scale conventional wars. The result is a U.S. policy that
specifies a continued role for U.S. nuclear weapons in deterring attacks
on allies by nonnuclear means that threaten their vital interests. [The
modified negative security assurance]{.underline} also [clarifies that
states such as North Korea]{.underline} that cheat and leave the NPT and
threaten the United States and its allies [are objects of U.S.
deterrence planning]{.underline}.¶ The bilateral dialogue with Japan
about whether to maintain or modify U.S. declaratory policy was
complicated in part by a language translation issue. As Yukio Satoh has
noted,¶ Discussions about the term "first use" in Japan are somewhat
distorted because of the Japanese translation of the term. The widely
used Japanese term for "first use"---"sensei-shiyo"---literally means
"preemptive use" in Japanese, while "first use" does not always imply
"preemptive use," particularly in contrast to preemptive "first strike."
It is understandable that a notion of "preemptive use" is repugnant to
many, and the Japanese are no exception . . . However it would be
counterproductive for the sake of the country's security if the Japanese
people would become critical of the U.S. policy of calculated ambiguity
about "first use," believing that "first use" is always preemptive.11¶
[On capabilities, the Obama administration **carefully considered** the
views of its allies in Northeast Asia]{.underline} and elsewhere before
retiring the nuclear-armed Tomahawk cruise missile and committing to
modernize dual-capable aircraft (DCA) that are globally deployable in
support of a commitment to an ally anywhere, not just in Europe. The two
capabilities to forward-deploy nuclear weapons with a nonstrategic
delivery system were essentially redundant from a U.S. perspective. From
an alliance perspective, the DCA had benefits for deterrence that the
Tomahawk did not. Deployment of DCA is a way to signal the shared and
collective resolve of the United States and its allies to stand together
in the face of nuclear coercion and aggression and efforts to split them
from one another with nuclear threats. These decisions reflected a view
shared by allies in Northeast Asia and Europe: that the strategic
systems of the United States alone are not sufficient for purposes of
deterrence and assurance.12¶ [One of the most important results of
the]{.underline} NPR-era [consultations was the personal engagement of
the U.S. president and his clear commitment to preserve the nuclear
umbrella]{.underline} even while reducing the role and number of U.S.
nuclear weapons. As President Obama declared in Tokyo in November 2009:
"So long as these \[nuclear\] weapons remain, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [will maintain a strong and effective nuclear
deterrent that guarantees the defense of our
allies]{.underline}---including South Korea and Japan."13 He followed
this with written guidance to the U.S. military "reaffirming the role of
nuclear weapons in extending deterrence to U.S. Allies and partners and
the U.S. commitment to strengthen regional deterrence architectures" and
directing the military to ensure "a wide range of effective response
options" drawing on both a strong strategic deterrent and the capability
to deploy nuclear weapons in the region.14¶ On conclusion of the NPR in
2010, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates,
[[Japan]{.mark}, and South Korea [were]{.mark} all [interested
in]{.mark} sustaining the **[high-level substantive
dialogue]{.mark}**]{.underline} that had been built during the NPR.
Accordingly, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and Japan
founded the]{.underline} Extended Deterrence Dialogue
([EDD]{.underline}), [and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[and the Republic of Korea founded th]{.underline}e Extended Deterrence
Policy Committee ([EDPC]{.underline}).¶ The mechanisms serve multiple
purposes: to institutionalize sustained leadership focus on these
issues, to enable active policy discussion and development where needed,
and to ensure sustained progress on practical agendas of cooperation in
support of the comprehensive strategy for strengthening regional
deterrence architectures. [The EDD and EDPC have helped to ensure
coordinated policy development]{.underline} in the subsequent strategic
documents and leadership statements of all three countries, as for
example in the development of South Korea's "proactive deterrence
strategy" and Japan's "dynamic deterrence." The EDD process had an
impact on Japan's 2010 National Defense Program Guidelines, where Japan
clarified its intention to play a role in countering nuclear threats
rather than simply "relying on" U.S. extended deterrence.15 [[The
EDPC]{.mark} has [produced a **tailored deterrence strategy**]{.mark}
[that helps]{.mark} the two countries [to "work together]{.mark} more
seamlessly [to maximize]{.mark} the effects of our
[deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}."16 [[These]{.mark} processes have also
[provided both]{.mark} allies [the opportunities]{.mark}]{.underline}
that European allies have had for decades [[to have **firsthand
experience** of]{.mark} the [capabilities]{.mark} the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [provides]{.underline} in
support of its extended deterrence commitments through visits to U.S.
nuclear bases and facilities.17 Cumulatively, [these]{.underline}
various new [forms of interaction have helped to build common
understanding of emerging deterrence challenges]{.underline}, the nature
of potential conflicts, and the means to address the risks of
escalation.¶ [[These]{.mark} processes have]{.underline} also
[[helped]{.mark} to **[meet rising demand in Japan]{.mark} and South
Korea**]{.underline} [[for]{.mark} a deeper understanding
of]{.underline} extended [[deterrence and]{.mark} of what they can do to
increase its [credibility]{.mark}]{.underline}. As one observer has
argued, officials in [Northeast Asia]{.underline} "want more than verbal
reassurances; they [want to know how deterrence works]{.underline}."18
Yukio Satoh summarized the issue cogently in 2009:¶ If the credibility
of the U.S. commitment is the question at issue, it is Japanese
perceptions that matter. [The U.S. commitment to provide extended
deterrence to Japan has been repeatedly affirmed by
presidents]{.underline}, including President Obama, and other senior
officials in agreed documents. Nevertheless, [Japanese
[misgivings]{.mark}]{.underline} and doubts about American commitment
[[persist]{.underline}]{.mark} . . . [[it is important for Tokyo to be
**officially engaged in consultations**]{.underline}]{.mark} with
Washington [on]{.underline} deterrence strategy, including [nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}. Without such consultations, the Japanese
government, let alone the public, will have to be speculative about the
credibility of U.S. commitment. That U.S. strategic thinking is
undergoing epoch-making changes makes such consultations more
important.19¶ All three capitals have wanted to ensure that efforts to
adapt and strengthen extended deterrence do not come at the expense of
efforts to use political tools to reduce and ultimately eliminate
nuclear dangers. Without strong agendas to try to denuclearize North
Korea, to try to engage China on strategic stability, to combat
proliferation networks in the region, and to strengthen nuclear
materials security, it is not clear that the political commitment would
have been found or sustained for these new deterrence-focused
processes.¶ In fact, **[[the three]{.mark} capitals [have largely
converged]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[on a common view of]{.mark} a
balanced approach to reducing [nuclear dangers]{.mark} with a mix of
military]{.underline} and political [tools]{.underline} and of the
fundamentally complementary roles of these tools. With an effective
extended deterrent in place, the nonproliferation and disarmament effort
may yet be advanced with denuclearization of the Korean peninsula---if
and as leaders in Pyongyang come to understand that new nuclear and
missile capabilities bring no enduring advantages for the North and
indeed bring significant new risks. And with a stable strategic balance,
that effort may also yet be advanced by China's participation in the
nuclear transparency and reductions process---if and as leaders in
Beijing come to believe that China's interest in a stable security
environment is best served by the practice of strategic restraint in a
manner that meets the transparency and other requirements of other
stakeholders in stability.

#### Ending [arms sales to Taiwan]{.underline} crushes faith in the [US order]{.underline} -- the DA starts with the [end of US/Japan ties]{.underline}

**Twining '13** (Daniel Twining, senior fellow for Asia at the German
Marshall Fund of the United States, 2-1-13, "The Taiwan Linchpin,"
<http://www.hoover.org/research/taiwan-linchpin>)

Canary in the coal mine Proponents of "letting Taiwan go" seem to assume
that everything else would remain unchanged in U.S. Asia strategy.
America's alliance system would remain robust, its military would
continue to expand its access to regional ports and basing facilities,
and non-Chinese Asia would continue to underwrite American leadership.
In fact, [abandoning Taiwan]{.underline} --- say, [by [ending]{.mark}
military [sales]{.mark}]{.underline} (it is the top recipient of
American arms worldwide) --- [[would create a cascade of]{.mark}
strategic [consequences that would upend the]{.mark} [U.S.-]{.mark}led
regional [order]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The [first]{.mark} thing [to
erode]{.mark} [would be]{.mark} the U.S.-[Japan
alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}, without which American leadership in East
Asia in its present form would be impossible. [Japan]{.underline},
Washington's most important ally in Asia, [may have few viable strategic
options to maintain an independent foreign policy without a free
Taiwan]{.underline}. As China's military power casts a growing shadow
over its neighbors, [[Japan's]{.mark} capacity to retain [strategic
choice may hinge on Taiwan]{.mark}'s ability to maintain autonomy from
the mainland --- in ways that preclude a hostile China from projecting
military power from Taiwan into the sea lanes that are the Japanese
economy's lifeline]{.underline}. Too often, analysis of Taiwan's
strategic evolution focuses on its implications for China, on the one
hand, and the United States, on the other. In fact, [the foundations of
[Japanese]{.mark} grand strategy]{.underline} since 1951 --- [starting
with its intimate [alliance with]{.mark} the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates ---
[may well [be unsustainable]{.mark} [should Taiwan fall under]{.mark}
the control of a hostile, assertive [China]{.mark} that defines Japan as
an adversary. As Japan's primary security partner, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates therefore [has a compelling
interest in protecting Taiwan's autonomy]{.underline}, not only for
reasons related to Taiwan and U.S.-China relations but [because it is
foundational to Japan's strategic future as America's bedrock ally in
East Asia]{.underline}. Taiwan and the U.S.-Japan alliance America's
role as what former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates called a "resident
power" in Asia is made possible by the U.S. alliance with Japan. Nearly
50,000 American troops are forward-deployed there, and it is
headquarters of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, whose ships and submarines
patrol the Pacific and Indian Ocean sea lanes that carry most world
trade in goods and energy resources. The problem of 20th-century Asia,
of how to constrain Japanese power, was solved by a post--World War II
alliance that contained Japanese militarism, reassuring its neighbors
and enabling Asia's economic miracle by allowing regional states to
focus on modernizing their economies rather than competing militarily.
China's own extraordinary growth since it launched economic reforms in
1978 was made possible by the security umbrella America provided to
Japan. This neutered armed conflict in East Asia and allowed American
forces to operate freely in the region in ways that reassured rather
than threatened key Asian powers. [[Japan's]{.mark} strategic posture
and identity as a [peace]{.mark}ful trading state are [intimately tied
to Taiwan]{.mark}'s orientation. Japan and Taiwan are natural
allies]{.underline} --- a term not usually associated with Japan's
relations with neighbors due to friction over "history issues" related
to wartime Japan's rapacity. [Japan and Taiwan share a strategic
geography as offshore trading powers dependent on free access to the
maritime commons. Japan is Taiwan's second-largest trading
partner]{.underline}, and their economies are closely bound together by
two-way flows of technology and capital as well as goods and services.
[They share a common military ally in the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, the lodestar of their security in a rapidly
changing region. They both define a national interest in an Asian
balance of power that is not dominated by mainland China but preserves
pluralism among Asia-Pacific states, allowing each to choose its
alignments freely. Cultural and political values pull Taiwan and Japan
together rather than pushing them apart, laying a more enduring
foundation for their shared strategic interests. Both are democracies in
which political power has alternated between parties and governments are
held accountable through strong institutions, free media, and the rule
of law. Culturally, Japan's occupation of Taiwan from 1895 to 1945 did
not leave the imperial scars so evident elsewhere in Asia; to the
contrary, Japanese administration helped modernize Taiwan and is
remembered as a time of progress. Today, people-to-people ties between
the two nations remain strong: Polling consistently shows that
majorities in both societies hold the other in high regard. Taiwanese
popular esteem for Japan is exceptional when compared with most of its
neighbors. Many scholars and analysts predict a near-term future in
which Taiwan is increasingly drawn into mainland China's embrace ---
willingly or otherwise. Yet [as long as Japan and the prc remain
security competitors, Taiwan's reintegration with the mainland would put
it on the wrong side of the divide, allied with the country that most
threatens it against its most natural East Asian partner]{.underline}.
In the absence of political liberalization in China, Taiwan's interests
and political values clash with the prc's as strongly as they coincide
with Japan's --- suggesting that [we might expect to see a closer
convergence in Japanese-Taiwanese relations over the coming decade,
rather than the divergence that would occur from Taiwan's reunification
with a still-authoritarian regime in Beijing]{.underline}. For this
reason, [the future of Taiwan's relations with Japan approach in
importance the future of relations across the Taiwan
Strait]{.underline}.

#### Stopping arms sales wrecks assurance

To augment its strategic resources, Taiwan continues to pursue a wide
range of weapons, but it runs into various obstacles and issues. Weapons
procurement from the United States and elsewhere is subject to political
concerns, as countries are worried about provoking Beijing. The recent
flux in Taiwan's overall strategy toward the China threat means that the
porcupine strategy recently favored by some U.S. strategists is only one
element considered in the ROC's multifaceted defense program. Thus, a
wide range of weapons systems are under consideration for purchase or
development by the current government and military leaders. These
include stealth aircraft such as the F-35B as well as submarines through
a long-stalled U.S. submarine program and an indigenous defensive
submarine program. [Veteran journalists often report [the view in
Taiwan]{.mark} that]{.underline} many [[U.S. weapons systems are
acquired]{.mark} less for defending against China and more [for their
**symbolic importance of showing continued U.S. support for Taiwan's
security**]{.mark}]{.underline}.86 [For]{.underline} both
[Taiwan]{.underline} and the United States, [the [arms sales
represent]{.mark} a [recurring show of commitment]{.mark}]{.underline}
to the island's defense. It remains the case, however, that weapons from
the United States must be justified by the U.S. government as defensive
in character. The U.S. president and Congress determine Taiwan's needs
as stated in the Taiwan Relations Act.

#### Ending arms sales would [devastate]{.underline} U.S. alliances *even though* Taiwan is a "different kind of ally."

[Glaser dismisses the idea that security assistance to Taiwan helps
sustain the postwar security architecture in East Asia]{.underline}. He
writes, "the risks of reduced U.S. credibility for protecting allies . .
. should be small, especially if any change in policy on Taiwan is
accompanied by countervailing measures."\[8\] Certainly, [[other nations
differentiate]{.mark} between Taiwan]{.underline}---which not only is
not a formal US ally, but which the US government does not even
recognize as a state---[and other US defense partners. [**Nonetheless**,
no competent security planner would dismiss a US retreat from a
long-standing]{.mark} security [commitment as irrelevant]{.mark},
especially if it appears driven by American weakness]{.underline}.

[[If Washington appears to be backing away]{.mark} from its commitment
to]{.underline} the [alliances and institutions]{.underline} in which it
has invested so much, [[other governments will take that as a
sign]{.mark} that [they may not]{.mark} be able to [rely on
US]{.mark}-backed [security arrangements]{.mark} to ensure their future
security, [forcing them to become more competitive]{.mark} and
individualistic]{.underline}. According to retired Army colonel and
military analyst Albert Willner, [America's [friends **already are on
the alert**]{.mark} for signs of a decline in US
commitments]{.underline}. He said in an interview, "[[There is a growing
sense]{.mark} in the world [that the US is a fair-weather
friend]{.mark}]{.underline}, it won't be there for the long run. [[This
causes]{.underline}]{.mark} people in [many [countries to **maneuver
ahead of time**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[to get into position in
anticipation]{.mark} of the day the US pulls back. [If the US makes
decisions regarding Taiwan that reinforce this perception, it will have
**profound implications for our other
relationships**]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Another strategic interest the United States has in maintaining close
ties to Taiwan rests with Taiwan's position on the front line of China's
rise. China's behavior toward Taiwan indicates how it will perform its
role as a lead actor on the world stage. As Randall Schriver, a former
deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs,
put it, "Beijing's ambitions go beyond Taiwan, but right now, it's the
Taiwan issue that drives their military modernization, so it's very
important to us. Taiwan is a prism through which we can understand
China's evolution, and gain insights into it." Richard Bush, a leading
analyst of the US-PRC-Taiwan relationship, summarized these concerns
when he said, "How the Taiwan Strait issue is resolved is an important
test---perhaps the most important test---of what kind of great power
China will be and of how the US will play its role as the guardian of
the international system." By extension, [how the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and its allies treat Taiwan is an important
indicator of what other countries in the region can expect from
Washington as the PRC's influence expands. [They may ask, if the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[acquiesces]{.mark} to a rising China [on]{.mark} the [Taiwan]{.mark}
issue, **[will it also acquiesce on issues important to
them?]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The U.S. Extended Political Deterrent to Japan [[While nuclear and
conventional capabilities provide]{.mark} the "[hard]{.mark}" aspects of
extended [deterrence, "soft]{.mark}" [components, including]{.mark} U.S.
[declaratory policy]{.mark}]{.underline}, clear statements of U.S.
support after provocative actions by adversaries, [[and formalized
bilateral dialogue, **are indispensable**]{.mark}
**components**]{.underline} [of the extended deterrent
relationship]{.underline}. [[Given]{.mark} the
[increasing]{.mark}]{.underline} [[uncertainty]{.mark} of Japan's
security environment]{.underline}, **[[continued]{.mark} U.S. [political
support]{.mark}]{.underline}** [for Japan [is **crucial as a means of
assuring** Tokyo. Washington sends strong signals to
Japan]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[and]{.mark} potential
[adversaries]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[through]{.mark} its [declaratory
policy]{.mark}]{.underline}, which outlines how and when the United
States might use military force. As discussed above, the 1960 Treaty of
Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan is
the linchpin of the alliance. Article 5 states, "Each party recognizes
that an armed attack against either Party in the territories under the
Administration of Japan would be dangerous to its own peace and safety
and declares that it would act to meet the common danger in accordance
with its constitutional provisions and processes."29 Despite the
"mutual" defense commitments of both the United States and Japan,
historically the United States has borne the majority of the burden for
providing protection to the alliance. [Declaratory policy under the
mutual defense treaty has become **particularly important**]{.underline}
[in light of escalating tensions with neighbors]{.underline}. [Some
Japanese scholars]{.underline} have [expressed concern]{.underline} that
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[could be reluctant to come to Japan's aid in the event of a low-level
conflic]{.underline}t, such as a dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu
Islands.30 [In providing assurance to Japan]{.underline}, **[it is
necessary]{.underline}** [to make clear that U.S. declaratory policy
applies to these types of contingencies. Another example]{.underline} of
declaratory policy [is [the 2010 Nuclear]{.mark} Posture
[Review]{.mark}, which [serves as a guiding document]{.mark}
for]{.underline} the [Obama]{.underline} Administration's nuclear
policy. [More than previous NPRs, [the]{.mark} 2010 [document
stresses]{.mark} the importance of [reducing]{.mark} the role of
[nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} in U.S. national security policy.
**[However]{.underline}**, [the document also identifies strengthening
regional deterrence and reassuring U.S. allies and partners as a **key
objective**]{.underline}.31 [[As part of the effort to assure
Japan]{.mark} that changes in U.S. policy would not be to Japan's
detriment, U.S. and Japanese [officials conducted]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[extensive consultations]{.mark} during the
formulation]{.underline}** of the 2010 NPR. [[Many]{.mark} Japanese
officials [felt]{.mark} that [those **close talks resolved**]{.mark}
**their [anxieties]{.mark}**]{.underline} regarding future U.S. policy
on nuclear weapons.32 **[[Crucially]{.underline}]{.mark}**, these
[[consultations gave Japan an **opportunity to provide
input**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the formulation of U.S. declaratory
policy, [and]{.mark} provided [a channel]{.mark} for Japan **[to
express]{.mark} its [thinking]{.mark} about the U.S. extended
deterrent**]{.underline}.

[A]{.underline} third [[part of]{.mark} the **[political]{.mark}
component of [extended deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[is
**formalized**]{.mark} bilateral [dialogue]{.mark} between
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
Japan.]{.underline} Unlike NATO's Nuclear Planning Group, which provides
member-states with a venue to discuss and influence nuclear policy, the
U.S.-Japan alliance does not include an institutionalized dialogue.
However, [the]{.underline} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and]{.mark} [Japan]{.mark} have
[collaborated to create]{.mark}]{.underline} other [[fora]{.mark} to
discuss]{.underline} nuclear policy [issues. In [2000]{.mark} Japan and
the United States [created the]{.mark}]{.underline} Security
Consultative Committee ([[SCC]{.underline}]{.mark}), which [is used
as]{.underline} [a forum for officials]{.underline} at the ministerial
level [[to discuss]{.mark} pertinent [policy issues]{.mark} to the
U.S.-Japan alliance]{.underline}.36 In 2007, [following
North]{.underline} [Korea's first nuclear test, the SCC]{.underline}
meeting (known as the two-plustwo) [reaffirmed that "the full range of
U.S. military capabilities]{.underline}, both nuclear and non-nuclear
strike forces and defensive capabilities, [form the core of the extended
deterrence]{.underline}."37 The [[Obama]{.underline}]{.mark}
administration, through the 2010 NPR, [[has taken **large steps to
further**]{.mark} **[institutionalize bilateral
dialogue]{.mark}**]{.underline}.38 In 2011, [the]{.underline}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[and Japan]{.underline} [established the]{.underline}]{.mark} Extended
Deterrence Dialogue ([[EDD]{.mark}), a biannual dialogue in which
American officials discuss U.S. nuclear capabilities with Japan, [with
the goal of **increasing transparency and enhancing**]{.mark} **Japan's
[assurance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [For example]{.underline}, in April
2012, [under]{.underline} the auspices of [the EDD, Japanese
officials]{.underline} spent three days at U.S. Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor
in Washington. During the site visit, Japanese officials [were shown a
U.S. nuclear attack submarine and Trident missiles]{.underline}.39
According to the Pentagon, [the [dialogue "**reinforces the**]{.mark}
**critical role of the U.S.-Japanese [alliance]{.mark}** [in
deterring]{.mark} and responding to strategic threats in]{.underline}
the [East Asia]{.underline} region. [[Through]{.underline}]{.mark} frank
discussion, **[[transparent information exchange]{.mark} and
interaction]{.underline}** with U.S. Navy personnel, [the [EDD
communicates to]{.mark} America's [allies that]{.mark} the U.S.
exte[nded deterrent continues to be **credible**]{.mark}]{.underline},
capable, [and enduring]{.underline}."40 [[As the]{.mark} U.S.-Japan
[alliance evolves]{.mark}]{.underline}, the [[political]{.mark}
component of extended [deterrence]{.mark}, including bilateral dialogue
and U.S. declaratory policy, **[will remain central to Japan's faith
in]{.mark} the [credibility of]{.mark} the extended
[deterrent]{.mark}**]{.underline}. U.S. policy makers and military
leaders should endeavor to broaden existing dialogues to include
discussion of the potential contribution of advanced conventional
weapons systems to Japanese and regional security.

[outlined]{.underline} in Henry Kissinger's recent book, On China.
[For]{.underline} the **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited

Conclusion and Policy Implications [[This study]{.underline}]{.mark},
**[the first]{.underline}** [to [subject]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[proliferation]{.underline}-tamping [effects of security
[guarantees]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to]{.mark} in-depth [quantitative
analysis]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**bolstered** by a]{.mark} focused [case
study,]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[robustly supports]{.underline}**]{.mark}
the [conventional [wisdom]{.mark}]{.underline} among policy makers in
Washington and elsewhere [that security [guarantees]{.mark}]{.underline}
can **[[reduce]{.mark} the risk of [nuclear
prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline}**. Recent quantitative and
qualitative [studies suggesting the absence of such a
relationship]{.underline}, or reaching indeterminate conclusions,
**[find little support]{.underline}** here. [[We]{.mark} especially want
to [highlight]{.mark}]{.underline} our [[findings with]{.mark} regard
to]{.underline} pursuit, or the [[launching]{.underline}]{.mark} of
nuclear [weapons [programs]{.mark}, [which we regard as
the]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[clearest]{.mark} demand
[signal]{.mark}]{.underline}** [for nuclear weapons]{.underline}. Given
the very small number of states that have acquired nuclear weapons,
those findings deserve to be taken with a grain of salt, especially
since robustness checks limiting the acquisition risk pool to only those
states that have previously explored or pursued yielded more mixed
results. In other words, [our [statistical]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[analysis suggests we]{.mark} can [be]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[extremely confident]{.underline}**]{.mark} that security
[[guarantees]{.underline}]{.mark} will [[make states that have
not]{.underline}]{.mark} yet [[launched]{.mark} their own]{.underline}
nuclear weapons [programs]{.underline} [**[less likely]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} [do so]{.underline}. But given data
constraints, we can be only moderately confident that once states have
launched indigenous nuclear weapons programs, the extension of security
guarantees will make them less likely to see these through to
acquisition. With some nuances, the latter is the story we have told
about South Korea, and at least in that case [security guarantees do
appear to have played a crucial role]{.underline} [in convincing a state
**not to see a nuclear weapons program**]{.underline}, albeit a modest
one, **[through to acquisition]{.underline}**. Further, [our [analysis
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[So]{.underline}]{.mark}**uth
**[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rean case [[suggests]{.underline}]{.mark}
that [[a country]{.underline} **[weighs fears of
abandonment]{.underline}**]{.mark} with the costs of pursuing a nuclear
program [in its decision]{.underline} whether to proliferate.
[[This]{.mark} decision [calculus suggests]{.mark}]{.underline} that US
[[policy makers]{.underline}]{.mark} can [take actions that]{.underline}
[[bolster]{.underline}]{.mark} or undercut the [[**credibility** of
a]{.mark} security [guarantee]{.mark}]{.underline} and thus the
country's fear of abandonment. As the South Korean case illustrates,
patron state troop deployments, joint operational planning, and joint
training seem to reduce abandonment concerns. These preliminary findings
also highlight the need for more in-depth analysis of the
proliferation-tamping effects of security guarantees, especially to try
to shed light on the conditions under which they may be more or less
effective. [[Policy makers seeking to prevent
prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline} [[**in the Middle East, Asia, and
elsewhere** are]{.mark} well [advised to consider]{.mark} security
[guarantees as a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[key
arrow]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in their quiver]{.underline}. At the same
time, this study suggests guarantees are not a nonproliferation panacea.
The relationship between guarantees and nonproliferationis
probabilistic, and our work suggests that a number of other factors play
crucial roles in determining proliferation outcomes. Further, the
nuances of particular states' domestic and external political
relationships can be expected to also play important roles. Caveats and
nuances notwithstanding, security guarantees appear to have played a
crucial role in stemming the spread of nuclear weapons in the past and
have the potential to do likewise in future.

protégé´ states can never feel completely secure (Goldstein 2000). [For

[Nuclear [allies]{.mark}]{.underline} can also [become **security
risks**]{.underline}. Vipin [Narang demonstrates]{.underline} that
[when]{.underline} ~~weaker~~ [\[junior\] states gain nuclear
weapons]{.underline}, [they]{.underline} often seek to
**[[coerce]{.underline}]{.mark}** their [[senior partners into
intervening]{.underline}]{.mark} on their behalf [[by
threatening]{.mark} to use [nuclear]{.mark} weapons]{.underline}.
[That's]{.underline} what [Israel]{.underline} did [at]{.underline} the
height of the 19**[73]{.underline}** Arab-Israeli War. That's what
[South Africa]{.underline} did [during]{.underline} its
19**[88]{.underline}** confrontation with Cuban forces in Angola.
[And]{.underline} that's what [Pakistan]{.underline} did in the midst of
its 1990 military crisis [with India]{.underline}. [Instead of
relieving]{.underline} the **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates of a military burden, as Donald Trump suggests,
having [more [nuclear allies]{.mark}]{.underline} could
**[[increase]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[risk]{.underline}]{.mark} that
the **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[would [get]{.mark} involved [in conflicts that]{.mark}]{.underline}
might **[[turn nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Furthermore,
[were]{.underline} South Korea or [[Japan]{.mark} to]{.underline} begin
[develop]{.underline}ing [nuclear weapons]{.underline}, their [[rivals
might]{.underline}]{.mark} be tempted to **[[launch]{.mark}
[preventive]{.mark} military [strikes]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [which
research suggests has been **frequently considered**]{.underline} in the
past. The [[road to]{.underline}]{.mark} nuclear [[acquisition]{.mark}
is]{.underline} often [rocky and [increases]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[likelihood of **[militarized conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For
example, [Soviet worries]{.underline} that [West Germany would
acquire]{.underline} nuclear weapons helped [trigger]{.underline} the
[Berlin Crisis]{.underline}. And [[if Japan]{.mark}]{.underline} or
South Korea [actually [acquired]{.mark}]{.underline} nuclear [weapons,
[we could]{.mark}]{.underline} possibly [[see]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[nuclear [arms race]{.mark} in Asia]{.underline}**. [Japan's
neighbors, including]{.underline} **[[So]{.underline}]{.mark}**uth
**[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea, [[would fear]{.mark}]{.underline}

**[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}**rth **[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea
[[would expand]{.underline}]{.mark} its nuclear [capabilities. [China
would]{.mark}]{.underline} continue to [[expand]{.mark} its]{.underline}
own nuclear [arsenal]{.underline}. Why haven't we seen nuclear arms
races before? [Nuclear "[domino]{.mark} effects" [have not been]{.mark}
common]{.underline} historically. [**[But]{.underline}**
[that's]{.underline}]{.mark} [largely [because of]{.mark}]{.underline}
determined **[[U.S. efforts]{.mark} to stop them.]{.underline}** Since
the dawn of the nuclear age, the United States has pursued
nonproliferation as a top policy priority. That includes sponsoring and
enforcing the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). [Research
suggests]{.underline} the [[NPT has]{.mark} been
**instrumental**]{.underline} [in [limit]{.mark}ing]{.underline} the
[[spread]{.mark} of nuclear weapons]{.underline}, in part [[by]{.mark}
coordinating]{.underline} states' [[beliefs]{.mark} about]{.underline}
one another's nonproliferation [commitments. To develop]{.underline}
nuclear weapons, [[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark} and South Korea
[[would]{.mark} need to violate or [withdraw]{.mark} from the NPT.
[That]{.mark} could [prompt]{.mark}]{.underline} U.S. **[allies and
adversaries]{.underline}** in other regions --- [including [Saudi
Arabia, Germany and Iran]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [[to]{.mark} question
the treaty]{.underline}'s viability [and [consider]{.mark}]{.underline}
seeking **[their own [nuclear]{.mark} arsenals]{.underline}**. [Would
this be so bad?]{.underline} After all, [no]{.underline} two
[nuclear]{.underline} armed [states have fought]{.underline} a [major
war]{.underline} with each other, and nuclear weapons have not been used
in conflict since the United States bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki in
1945. **[But]{.underline}** the [conclusion]{.underline} that [nuclear
weapons produce peace is **subject to debate**]{.underline}. It's true
that there has been [no war]{.underline} between major powers since
1945. But that [may be due to other factors]{.underline}. The
**[quantitative evidence]{.underline}** linking nuclear weapons to a
reduced risk of conflict [is limited at best]{.underline}. Further,
[theoretical and historical evidence suggests]{.underline} that nuclear
**[[accidents and miscalc]{.mark}ulations]{.underline}** [[are
likely]{.underline}. [More]{.underline}]{.mark} [countries]{.underline}
with nuclear weapons would [[mean]{.mark} more
opportunities]{.underline} [for **[catastrophic nuclear
mistakes]{.mark}**]{.underline}. So what's the takeaway? A look at
history shows us that [nuclear [prolif]{.mark}]{.underline}eration
**[[is anything but inevitable]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[U.S.]{.underline} nonproliferation [efforts have been]{.underline}
surprisingly **[successful]{.underline}**, even when the United States
was ~~weaker~~ \[less influential\] than it is today.
[[Without]{.underline}]{.mark} firm [[U.S. opposition]{.mark}
to]{.underline} the [spread of nuclear weapons]{.underline} --- a policy

and "sticks" like sanctions --- the [[world would]{.underline}]{.mark}
probably [[have]{.underline}]{.mark} far [[more]{.mark} than nine
countries with nuclear [weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline} What's more,
[research suggests]{.underline} that [nuclear

#### Loss of security credibility causes Japan prolif

**Yoshihara 9** (Toshi Yoshihara and James Holmes, visiting professor at
the U.S. Air War College, in Montgomery, Alabama; and senior research
associate at the University of Georgia Center for International Trade
and Security, Naval War College Review. Washington: Summer 2009. Vol.
62, Iss. 3; pg. 59, Thinking about the Unthinkable: Tokyo\'s Nuclear
Option, proquest)

Japanese concerns over the Obama administration\'s recent moves to
advance nonproliferation and disarmament objectives attest to such
sensitivities. Specifically, Japanese policy makers fret that \"extended
deterrence could weaken if Washington appears too eager to placate China
and Russia on these \[global disarmament\] issues in pursuit of the
nonproliferation objective or if it permits a latent North Korean
nuclear capability in exchange for safeguards against proliferation.\"
33 In 2006, North Korea\'s nuclear test compelled the Japanese
government to seek public reassurances from the United States that
extended deterrence remained intact.34 Not surprisingly, [[even skeptics
on]{.mark} the matter of [Japanese nuclearization concede]{.mark} that
an [erosion of American cred]{.mark}ibility could [fundamentally
reshape]{.mark} the [Japanese]{.mark} strategic
[calculus]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Congressional Research Service
forcefully contends that \"perhaps [the [single most important
factor]{.mark} to date in [dissuading Tokyo]{.mark} from developing a
nuclear arsenal [is]{.mark} the [U.S. guarantee to protect Japan\'s
security]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"35 The causes and processes by which
U.S. extended deterrence could be undermined in Tokyo\'s eyes are beyond
the scope of this article. Nevertheless, we contend that [a
**[gradual]{.mark} or sudden [collapse of the nuclear umbrella]{.mark}**
[would be]{.mark} among the most decisive [stimuli for a
Japanese]{.mark} nuclear [breakout]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed,
historical precedents in Cold War Asia provide ample evidence of the
proliferation-related consequences of real or perceived American
indifference to the region. [In the past, perceptions of declining
American credibility and of weaknesses in the nuclear umbrella have
spurred concerted efforts by allies to break out]{.underline}. In 1971,
under the Nixon Doctrine, which called on allies to bear heavier
burdens, [Washington withdrew a combat division from the Korean
Peninsula]{.underline}. [As a consequence]{.underline}, according to
Seung-Young Kim, \"[Korean leaders were not sure about U.S. willingness
to use nuclear weapons,\" despite the presence of tactical nuclear
weapons]{.underline} on Korean soil.36 [Such fears compelled President
Park]{.underline} [ChungHee to initiate a crash nuclear-weapons
program]{.underline}. To compound matters, President Jimmy Carter\'s
abortive attempt to withdraw all U.S. forces and nuclear weapons from
the Korean Peninsula accelerated Park\'s pursuit of an independent
deterrent. Similarly, China\'s nuclear test in 1964 kindled \"fear that
Taiwan might be wiped out in a single attack, with U.S. retaliation
coming too late to prevent destruction.\" 37 This [lack of confidence in
American security guarantees impelled Chiang Kai-shek to launch a
nuclear-weapons program]{.underline}. The Sino-U.S. rapprochement of the
early 1970s further stimulated anxieties among Nationalist leaders about
a potential abandonment of Taiwan. In fulfilling its pledges under the
Shanghai Communiqué, which began the normalization process, the United
States substantially reduced its troop presence on the island. As Nancy
Bernkopf Tucker argues, \"The withdrawal of American forces from Taiwan
compelled the Nationalists to think more seriously about alternative
ways of protecting themselves,\" including nuclear weapons.38 Recently
declassified materials document growing American alarm at the prospect
of a nuclear breakout on the island throughout the decade.39 [In both
cases, [sustained American]{.mark}]{.underline} pressure, combined with
[[reassurances]{.mark}, persuaded the two East Asian powers [to]{.mark}
forgo the nuclear option. The [Taiwan]{.mark}ese and South Korean
experiences]{.underline} nonetheless [[show]{.mark} that [states succumb
to proliferation temptations as a result of a deteriorating security
environment]{.mark}, heightened threat perceptions, and a **lessening of
confidence in the United States**]{.underline}. While Japan certainly
faces far different and less worrisome circumstances, these two case
studies serve as a reminder to analysts not to casually wave away the
possibility of a Japanese nuclear option.

[Following Singh and Way, [we analyze]{.mark}]{.underline} our data

[[not drop states once they engage]{.underline}]{.mark} in the behavior
in question---for example, after the United States acquired nuclear

[in every]{.underline} subsequent [year]{.underline}---[[it gives **less
traction**]{.mark} on why states initiate proliferation]{.underline}
behavior [\[END FOOTNOTE\] [We employ]{.mark} the [Akaike]{.mark}
information criterion [to adjudicate]{.mark} between]{.underline} the
[[Weibull]{.underline}]{.mark} distribution [[and
Cox]{.underline}]{.mark} semiparametric approach [[taken
by]{.mark}]{.underline} some [[other]{.underline}]{.mark} recent
proliferation [[studies]{.underline}]{.mark} (Akaike 1974). [We
find]{.underline} the [[Weibull]{.underline}]{.mark} approach
**[superior]{.underline}**, and further note that [it [yields **more
precise estimates**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [especially in a modest sized
data set]{.underline} of the sort employed here (Box-Steffensmeier and
Jones 1997).19 [**[As a robustness check]{.underline}**, [we
reran]{.underline}]{.mark} [all our reported models
[using]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[Cox]{.underline}]{.mark} approach.
Multivariate Analysis [[We present]{.mark} **both**]{.underline}
[''[core'' and]{.mark} ''fully [specified'' models]{.mark} to shed light
on]{.underline} the relationship between [security guarantees and
proliferation]{.underline} behavior **[[while controlling]{.mark} for a
range of variables]{.underline}**. Table 2 presents our core models.
[Security [guarantees are]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**statistically
significant and negative** for **all**]{.underline}]{.mark} [three
[stages of proliferation; we can be]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[highly
confident]{.underline}**]{.mark} that [states receiving security
guarantees are **less likely** to explore, pursue, and acquire nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. The other results are unsurprising. Economic and
nuclear capacity are significantly and positively associated with all
the three stages of proliferation. Conventional threat is significantly
and positively linked to both exploration and pursuit, though not
acquisition. The latter is puzzling, but the more fully specified model
reported later, as well as almost all the additional models we ran as
robustness checks, found conventional threat to be robustly and
positively linked to acquisition. Nuclear threat is significantly and
positively linked to exploration, but has no relationship to pursuit and
acquisition, consistent with Bleek's (2010) previously reported findings
employing a different model but contra conventional wisdom about
''reactive proliferation'' dynamics. [[Prior studies]{.mark} have
[incorporated other]{.mark} potentially relevant
[variables]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the fully specified model in
[[Table 3 includes]{.mark} **an array of [these]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Despite the large number of variables, [the core]{.mark}
result]{.underline} on security guarantees **[[remains
robust]{.underline}]{.mark}**, although as expected the large number of
variables reduces statistical significance across the board. [With
regard to the **core control variables**]{.underline}, [economic
capacity is no longer statistically significant]{.underline} for explore
or pursue, though still significantly and positively correlated with
exploration and acquisition. [And [dropping]{.mark}]{.underline} [a
few]{.underline} of the [[variables]{.mark} [that are never
significant]{.mark}]{.underline} for any stage of proliferation behavior
[[restores]{.mark} the]{.underline} **[[highly significant and positive
relationship]{.underline}]{.mark}** at the pursue stage [without
meaningfully affecting the results for other variables]{.underline}.
Nuclear capacity remains significant at explore and pursue, albeit no
longer at acquire. Like economic capacity, dropping a few variables that
are never significant for any stage of proliferation behavior restores
the statistically significant and positive correlation at the acquire
stage. Conventional threat is no longer statistically significant for
explore, but is highly significant for both pursue and acquire. Nuclear
threat yields the same results as the core models at reduced statistical
significance.

[nuclear weapons **as long as they can rely on the US**]{.mark} for
ultimate security]{.underline}. [Even [Taiwan]{.mark}, which does not
enjoy an explicit US alliance relationship, **[can count on de facto US
protection]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To state the converse, a [[failure
of]{.mark} the US to ensure [effective deterrence would be the strongest
stimulant to a **proliferation cascade**]{.mark}]{.underline} in
Northeast Asia. Japan, for example, worries about China\'s recent
nuclear force modernisation. There is equal if not greater concern about
China\'s growing conventional anti-access/area-denial capabilities and
whether they might someday preclude America\'s ability to come to
Japan\'s defence. Combined with China--US mutual vulnerability at the
strategic level, a perceived superiority of China\'s conventional
capabilities conceivably could cause Japan to consider a nuclear
dimension of its own. [[In Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}, notwithstanding
the trend against all forms of nuclear technology, resumed tensions with
the mainland that appear on the horizon mean that
[[nuclear-hedging]{.underline}]{.mark} options [[cannot be ruled out,
especially if the US]{.mark} were to become isolationist or its
**[perceived commitment to defend Taiwan were to
weaken]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the Korean Peninsula, a loss of
credibility of the US extended deterrence could make the nuclear
imbalance between North and South intolerable to Seoul.

Like Japan and South Korea, [[Taiwan is]{.underline}]{.mark} often
considered to be [[a latent nuclear power]{.mark}, [possessing]{.mark}
the [technological basis for developing nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. Like South Korea, [[Taiwan twice went down
the weapons path]{.underline}]{.mark} in a post-war period of
authoritarian rule and deep security anxieties. Today, the
authoritarianism is gone but the [[reasons for anxiety
remain]{.underline}. [Taiwan faces]{.underline}]{.mark} [a potential
[existential threat **unparalleled**]{.mark} **[anywhere else]{.mark} in
the world**]{.underline}, and its weakness relative to the Chinese
mainland increases by the day. **[[Yet non-proliferation norms are
strong]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [A resumed [nuclear weapons pursuit
cannot be ruled out **if the**]{.mark} **implicit [US defence commitment
were to wane]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} the positive shift in
[cross-Strait relations were to change]{.mark}]{.underline}
dramatically. **[[Neither condition is likely for the foreseeable
future]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although a negative political shift in
cross-Strait relations may be in the offing, it is not likely to change
things so dramatically that it will reverse Taiwan\'s non-proliferation
status.

### A2: Assurances Resilient\-\--Nuke Umbrella

#### Nuclear umbrella alone is insufficient -- three warrants -- stability/instability paradox renders massive retaliation not credible, conventional means resolve de-coupling risks, and US opposition to mutual vulnerability

[[The **comprehensive approach**]{.underline} [to]{.underline}]{.mark}
[strengthening [extended deterrence]{.mark} clearly [embeds]{.mark} the
[nuclear]{.mark} component of the [strategy]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[in
a larger]{.mark} policy [construct]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As one
analyst has described it, "the nuclear umbrella has become the pinnacle
of a security dome."13 [The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates has [set out this comprehensive approach **[as
opposed to]{.mark} relying on [nuclear]{.mark} means
[alone]{.mark}**]{.underline} [for three]{.underline} basic [reasons.
First, [the threat]{.mark} of]{.underline} U.S. [nuclear
use]{.underline} **[[may not]{.mark} always [be
credible]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in the eyes of]{.underline} the
[individual(s) the United States might seek to deter. [Some]{.mark}
enemy [may convince itself]{.mark} that [there are forms]{.mark} of
nuclear attack]{.underline} (or other forms of attack) [that fall
[beneath the]{.mark} U.S. response [threshold]{.mark}]{.underline}. For
example, [an enemy might believe]{.underline} that [nuclear
attack]{.underline} primarily [to generate]{.underline}
**[e]{.underline}**lectro**[m]{.underline}**agnetic
**[p]{.underline}**ulse [effects]{.underline} on nearby conventional
forces [might escape a U.S. nuclear response]{.underline}. **[[This
could be a]{.mark} serious [miscalculation]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[but]{.underline}]{.mark}, from a deterrence perspective, this scenario
[[highlights]{.mark} the **[value of supplemental]{.mark} non-nuclear
[elements]{.mark}** in the deterrence architecture. Second, whether or
not nuclear threats are credible]{.underline}, the [[non-nuclear
components]{.underline}]{.mark} of this strategy **[[offer]{.mark}
valuable [deterrence benefits]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} For
example, **[[b]{.underline}]{.mark}**allistic
**[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**issile **[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**efense of
the U.S. homeland [[mitigates de-coupling]{.mark} risks
[by]{.mark}]{.underline} greatly reducing if not [[eliminating
risks]{.mark} run]{.underline} by the United States in
[defending]{.underline} its [allies]{.underline}. [And
**b**]{.underline}allistic **[m]{.underline}**issile
**[d]{.underline}**efense [within the region protects **key
assets**]{.underline} [from an enemy's preemptive strikes, enables
offensive operations]{.underline} to begin at a time of our choosing
rather than the enemy's, [and raises the scale of attack]{.underline}
that [an attacker must attempt]{.underline} if it wants [to
overwhelm]{.underline} the [defense]{.underline} ([severely limiting the
credibility of threats]{.underline} to launch a small number of weapons
while holding more in reserve). [[These]{.mark} strategic
[benefits]{.mark}]{.underline} [help to **[reduce the role of nuclear
weapons in regional deterrence architectures]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[even while a core element remains]{.underline}, given the fundamental
role of nuclear weapons in deterring nuclear attack. [Third, [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates **flatly [rejects]{.mark}** [mutual
vulnerability]{.mark}]{.underline} as the basis of the strategic
relationship with states like North Korea and Iran that violate
international obligations, destabilize their regions and threaten their
neighbors, and threaten the United States with nuclear attack.
[[The]{.mark} global security [environment would become]{.mark} **deeply
[unstable]{.mark}** [if]{.mark} such [states]{.mark} were to
[conclude]{.mark} that [they are]{.mark} free [under their own nuclear
umbrellas]{.mark} to coerce their neighbors and commit
aggression]{.underline}.14

### A2: Assurances Resilient\-\--Post-Plan Assurances

#### Even if the plan is offset with security assurances, they fail -- South Korea proves

While the South Koreans secretly acquired components for an indigenous
nuclear weapon capability, [[US actions]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[continued to [undercut]{.mark} the [credibility of the]{.mark} US
[commitment]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Following]{.underline} Gerald
[[Ford]{.mark}'s assumption of the Presidency, the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [[announced the
Pacific Doctrine]{.underline}]{.mark}, which advocated a burden-sharing
approach similar to the Guam Doctrine. **[[While]{.mark} President [Ford
provided assurances]{.mark}]{.underline}** that
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[would not continue scaling
down]{.mark} its troop levels]{.underline} in the ROK, South [[Korean
policy makers **were uncertain** whether]{.mark} US domestic [politics
**might lead to changes**]{.mark} **in that position**]{.underline}
(Siler 1998). [[As a result of]{.mark} this]{.underline}
[**[uncertainty]{.underline}** [surrounding]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
**[credibility]{.mark} of the US commitment**]{.underline}, South
[[Korean decision makers **continued to develop**]{.mark} **[nuclear
weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline} [as a way to ensure the country's
security]{.underline} (MacDonald 1988). Indeed, South Korean president
[[Park told]{.mark} the Washington Post]{.underline} that [[his country
would]{.mark} actively [pursue the nuclear option if
the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[withdrew]{.underline}]{.mark} its
nuclear umbrella (Ha 1978).

### A2: Credibility Theory False

#### Abandoning Taiwan kills US credibility with [all]{.underline} Asian allies -- causes [prolif]{.underline}

**Rehman '14** (Iskander Rehman, a fellow at the Center for Strategic
and Budgetary Assessments, 2-28-14, "Why Taiwan Matters,"
<http://nationalinterest.org/print/commentary/why-taiwan-matters-9971?page=2>)

[[Abandoning Taiwan would erode]{.mark} [American]{.mark}
[cred]{.mark}ibility in the Indo-Pacific [and]{.mark} add [fuel]{.mark}
to an ongoing **[regional arms race]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Taiwan
policy cannot be compartmentalized]{.underline}, and viewed in isolation
from the pivot and U.S. policy towards Asia. [[Decision-makers in Seoul,
Tokyo, and Manila would]{.underline}]{.mark} naturally [[question
U.S.]{.mark} [resolve and]{.mark} Washington's [commitment to]{.mark}
their [security]{.mark} in the event of an abandonment of
Taiwan]{.underline}. \[22\][[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark}, in particular,
[[would feel threatened]{.underline}]{.mark} \[22\] [[by]{.mark} the
stationing of [Chinese forces on Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}---in
essence losing a valuable geopolitical buffer---[[in such close
proximity to its southwestern approaches]{.mark}. Heightened threat
perceptions in Tokyo,]{.underline} if combined with a lack of faith in
the credibility of U.S. conventional and nuclear deterrence, [[could
lead Japan to acquire a nuclear-weapons capability.]{.mark} The
corrosive effect of [forfeiting Taiwan would]{.mark}]{.underline} also
[[extend to]{.underline}]{.mark} other key allies such as
[**[So]{.mark}**uth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea, [which]{.mark} might [question
Washington's determination to]{.mark} [defend]{.mark} it [from]{.mark}
**[No]{.mark}**rth **[Ko]{.mark}**rean aggression]{.underline}. Indeed,
recent public-opinion polls have indicated that [a [growing proportion
of]{.mark} the **[So]{.mark}**uth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea [public]{.mark} now
[favors]{.mark} the [development of]{.mark} a **[So]{.mark}**uth
**[Ko]{.mark}**rea [nuclear arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline}. Revealingly,
[the [reasons]{.mark}]{.underline} [[invoked]{.underline}]{.mark} \[23\]
for such a shift [[were]{.mark} growing concerns over North Korea's
increasingly unpredictable and belligerent behavior, as well as over the
continued [viability of]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates[' [security
guarantee]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Policymakers [believe]{.underline} it 

**Tang 5** -- Shiping Tang, associate research fellow and deputy
director of the Center for Regional Security Studies at the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, January-March, "Reputation, Cult
of Reputation, and International Conflict," Security Studies, Vol. 14,
No. 1, p. 34-62

The problem, of course, is that [[politicians]{.underline}]{.mark}
usually **[[do not have]{.underline}]{.mark}** such [[**nuanced
understandings** of cred]{.mark}ibility]{.underline}, reputation,
[resolve, and capability]{.underline}.24 Too often, [[they]{.mark}
[fight]{.mark} for]{.underline} behavioral [reputation]{.underline} for
resolve and hope [[to improve]{.mark} their bargaining reputation (thus
[credibility) in the future]{.mark}]{.underline}. By doing so, they
confuse themselves, mislead their domestic audiences, and squander their
countries' blood and treasure for the wrong commodity. In fact, most
strategists and politicians have either lumped the two kinds of
reputation together or believed that behavioral reputation can easily be
converted into bargaining reputation (that is, [[they]{.mark} have
[believe]{.mark}d]{.underline} that [[commitments are **interdependent**
or]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[reputation is
**fungible**]{.underline}]{.mark}). Because developing and maintaining a
behavioral reputation for being resolute is desirable, many politicians
and strategists undertake certain tasks ex ante to develop such a
reputation, without ever questioning whether having a behavioral
reputation is possible at all. [[This]{.mark} practice]{.underline}, as
discussed below, [[informs]{.underline}]{.mark} one central belief
behind [[the **cult of reputation**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Perhaps
[[because behavior]{.mark}al reputation]{.underline} is something that
[[may count]{.mark} in the future]{.underline}, moreover, [[it is the
type]{.underline}]{.mark} of reputation [[about which decisionmakers are
most]{.mark} [concerned]{.mark}]{.underline}.25 In fact, decisionmakers
actually may bargain hard largely because they care more about their
future behavioral reputation. This article thus focuses on behavioral
reputation for resolve (which hereafter will be referred to as
"reputation" unless specified otherwise).

#### Theory's true -- strong empirical basis

**Gibler 8** (Douglas M., Professor of Political Science -- University
of Alabama, "The Costs of Reneging: Reputation and Alliance Formation",
Journal of Conflict Resolution, 52(3), June, p. 4)

[More sophisticated [treatments of]{.mark} the [reputation logic have
been produced by **formal theorists**]{.mark}, both [in **economics**
and]{.mark} in **[political science]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
economics, the ability of firm reputation to deter competition has been
well analyzed (see Kreps and Wilson, 1982; Wilson, 1989; and Weigelt and
Camerer, 1988), and political scientists have adopted these theories as
tools in understanding the types of signals leaders can send (see for
example, Alt, Calvert, and Humes, 1988; Ordeshook, 1986; and Wagner,
1992). Sartori (2002) and Guisinger and Smith (2002) probably go
furthest in arguing that [leaders]{.underline} and their envoys [have
incentives to develop]{.underline} certain types of
[[reputations]{.underline}]{.mark} in order [to
[overcome]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[uncertainty]{.underline}]{.mark}
endemic to crisis diplomacy. In these models, [a reputation for [honesty
allows the sender to credibly give information]{.mark} that would
otherwise be "cheap talk", [and]{.mark}]{.underline} thus, [[leaders may
concede less important issues, without bluffing]{.underline}]{.mark}, in
order to maintain a reputation for honesty when more important issues
arise (Sartori, 2002: 122). [The sum argument]{.underline} of these
statements and theoretical treatments [is clear.
**[Decision-makers]{.mark} argue and [act]{.mark}**]{.underline}, at
least in part, **[based [on reputations]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Traditional deterrence theory suggests reputations should be pursued by
leaders as important and manipulable tools, which are useful in future
crises. [Formal theorists agree]{.underline}; reputations provide
valuable information when the costs of signaling are low.

#### Nations pay attention to other regions -- plan's action gets perceived by key allies

Further from a U.S. perspective, [partnership with [allies
in]{.mark}]{.underline} three [[different regions **provides**]{.mark}
**many [opportunities for cross-fertilization]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To
varying degrees, [analysts and [policy makers **pay attention
to**]{.mark} **developments in [other regions]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[with an eye to]{.mark} their [local implications]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Analysts in [Japan]{.mark}]{.underline} have [**[examined]{.mark}
multiple developments** in [Europe]{.mark} for their impact on the East
Asian security environment. [NATO's]{.mark}]{.underline} [[nuclear
debate has been of interest]{.mark} in Japan]{.underline}. Michito
[[Tsuruoka]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example, [[sees]{.mark} an
[opportunity for]{.mark} a nuclear policy [dialogue]{.mark}]{.underline}
between experts in Japan and Europe: "**[[despite considerable]{.mark}
[differences]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}[in their respective
security situations, [the two]{.mark} communities]{.underline}
\[transatlantic and Asian\] **[[face similar challenges concerning
extended deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [and
interaction]{.underline} between the two communities "[might create
fresh perspectives]{.underline} and new policy dynamics."20 NATO's
proposal that Russia re-locate tactical nuclear weapons away from the
Euro-Atlantic security environment has sparked concern in Japan, as it
appears that NATO is seeking to export its problems to East Asia, much
as it seemed ready to do in the early 1980s when many in NATO advocated
for re-location of Soviet nuclear-tipped intermediate-range nuclear
forces to somewhere East of the Ural mountains (where they might have
targeted Japan).21 Yukio Satoh has argued that: "the Strategic Concept
adopted at NATO's Lisbon Summit in 2010...fell short of what Japan had
expected of NATO: a global perspective from which to address the issue
of nuclear weapons."22

#### It\'s [especially true]{.underline} for leaving Taiwan

**Bosco '15** (Joseph A. Bosco, national security consultant, retired in
2010 from the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Sumitro Chair
for Southeast Asia Studies,May 15, 2015, "Taiwan and Strategic
Security", The Diplomat,
<http://thediplomat.com/2015/05/taiwan-and-strategic-security/>)

For the same reason, Taiwan now became even more of a bone in Beijing's
throat as a model of democratic governance in a Chinese society,
undermining the myth that democracy and Confucianism are incompatible.
The potential internal pressure for political reform in China increased
during the 1980s, culminating in the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre.
Given those geopolitical stakes regarding the future of Taiwan, the U.S.
commitment enshrined in the Taiwan Relations Act took on even greater
strategic significance for the United States. [When President Barack
[Obama]{.mark} announced what he called the U.S. "[pivot to
Asia]{.mark}" before the Australian parliament in 2011, he linked
America's strategic interests to the success of democracy in the region
and pledged "every element of American power" to achieving "security,
prosperity, and dignity for all." That [places Taiwan]{.mark} and its
democratic future [at the ]{.mark}]{.underline}strategic [[**epicenter**
of America's]{.mark} moral and political [commitment to the
region]{.mark}. [U.S.]{.mark} [cred]{.mark}ibility [is]{.mark} now
**[tied inextricably to Taiwan's fate]{.mark}**, with or without an
explicit defense commitment in the TRA. [Any weakening of American
resolve to]{.mark} ensure [Taiwan]{.mark}'s continued security [would
significantly undermine]{.mark} that [cred]{.mark}ibility [throughout
the region]{.mark} among friends, allies, and most critically, our
adversaries. [Those who argue]{.mark} that the [Taiwan]{.mark} game [is
not worth]{.mark} the candle [fail to grasp how much weight other
countries]{.mark} in the region [place on]{.mark} America's commitment
to [Taiwan as a bell-weather of U.S. reliability]{.mark} should any of
them come under increased coercive pressure or outright hostility from
China. [They see the U.S. as the necessary balancer to China']{.mark}s
military buildup and expansionist policies and [Taiwan is the number one
test case of U.S. will.]{.mark}]{.underline} That is why the U.S.
declarative policy of "strategic ambiguity" needs to change sooner
rather than later. Washington's refusal to make an explicit public
commitment to not only provide Taiwan with defensive weapons but to come
actively to its defense sows doubts in the region. Worse, it encourages
China to continue pursuing its anti-access, area denial strategy of
deploying attack submarines and ballistic missiles to deter, delay, or
defeat any U.S. intervention in a cross-Strait conflict. After all,
Washington has said ever since 1995 that it might or might not defend
Taiwan depending on the circumstances. So Beijing has been creating the
circumstances to affect that calculus. Would it have invested so much of
its national wealth and effort to an anti-Taiwan strategy if the U.S.
had made it clear back in 1995 that an attack on Taiwan would certainly
mean military conflict, possibly all-out war with the United States?
Whatever their faults, Chinese leaders are not suicidal. Yet, some
experts argue that a clear declarative policy statement is unnecessary
and "passé." According to that thesis, China has been told in no
uncertain terms in various private meetings of the U.S. commitment to
defend Taiwan so, they argue, it is already being deterred from taking
action against Taiwan.

The second thought concerns the very desirability of pursuing a
conventional military strategy. [Some]{.underline} readers [might
conclude]{.underline} from this monograph that the balance of power is
so hopeless for Taiwan that Chinese victory is inevitable. As such, [the
nuclear weapons option ought to receive consideration]{.underline}.
[Such]{.underline} assessments [would be]{.underline} **[terribly
wrong]{.underline}**, however. [[The]{.underline} **[worst
thing]{.underline}**]{.mark} that [[Taiwan could do
is]{.mark}]{.underline} to [reopen the [nuclear]{.mark}
question]{.underline}. To begin with, [[Taiwan]{.underline} [would be
unable to reconstitute]{.underline}]{.mark} [a nuclear]{.underline}
weapons [program [in secret]{.mark}. Throughout the]{.underline}
19[60s]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the 19[70s]{.underline},
**[Washington was aware]{.underline}** [of Taiwanese]{.underline}
[efforts]{.underline} to procure sensitive nuclear technologies. In
1987, a double agent informed the intelligence community in the United
States of Taiwanese activities.253 [The likelihood]{.underline} that
[this]{.underline} sort of [[intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark}
experience [[would repeat itself]{.underline}]{.mark}, whether with a
Chinese or U.S. double agent, **[is high]{.underline}**.
[[Disclosure]{.underline}]{.mark} of this program
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} **[almost certainly]{.underline}**
[[provoke]{.mark} the very thing that the nuclear weapons would
purportedly seek to deter**: a [Chinese]{.mark} military
[attack]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [Even if Taiwan
were]{.underline}]{.mark} [somehow [to]{.mark} succeed in [secretly
develop]{.mark}ing nuclear weapons, [it would have to disclose]{.mark}
those capabilities [eventually]{.mark} in order to realize their
deterrent benefits. Yet [such]{.mark} a gesture [would]{.mark} still
[be]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[profoundly
destabilizing]{.underline}**]{.mark} [because [Chinese decision-makers
would]{.mark}]{.underline} probably [[feel **intense**]{.mark}
**domestic [pressure]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to use]{.mark} military
[force]{.mark} before Taiwan acquires reliable delivery vehicles
or]{.underline} a survivable [second-strike]{.underline} capability.
[Worsening this situation is that [Taiwan would
remain]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[highly vulnerable]{.underline}**]{.mark}
precisely [because it chose to neglect its own defenses. A robust
conventional military posture is thus the **safer**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[more prudent]{.underline}** posture for Taiwan
because it will not encourage such dynamics.

### Asian Prolif\-\--A2: Inev

#### Not inevitable and not an answer -- speed and severity clearly matter, and security assurances allow more stable proliferation

[Beyond identifying which factors]{.underline} seem to [make assurances
more or less effective]{.underline} in proliferation, [these cases
provide a number of additional insights]{.underline}. The first is that,
[[even]{.mark} in circumstances [where proliferation is]{.mark} highly
[likely]{.mark}]{.underline} (such as in the British case),
[policymakers' [actions]{.mark} can **still [have an effect in]{.mark}
either [slowing or catalyzing proliferation]{.mark}**. [In the British
case]{.mark},]{.underline} given the likelihood that the UK would
develop an independent nuclear capability, [[it is]{.mark} perhaps
[surprising]{.mark} that [the U.S. could have]{.mark} a substantial
[influence]{.mark}]{.underline} on the program. [[Yet]{.mark} U.S.
actions, especially with [the Quebec Agreement and]{.mark} the [McMahon
Act]{.mark}, clearly [did]{.mark}. This suggests]{.underline} that U.S.
[[policymakers **should not**]{.mark} **automatically [assume]{.mark}**
that credible security [assurances will be unable to work]{.mark} in
hard cases]{.underline}. Second, in circumstances [[where
prolif]{.mark}eration [is possible]{.mark}]{.underline}, though not as
likely as in the U.K. case, U.S[. security [assurances **can be even
more influential**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [As the South Korean episode
illustrates, the [credibility]{.mark} of the U.S. commitment **[directly

[Is]{.underline} the [nuclear domino theory historically
valid?]{.underline} Despite its longstanding centrality to thinking on
nuclear proliferation amongst scholars and policymakers, in recent years
a revisionist consensus has emerged in opposition to this traditional
view. [[Based on]{.underline}]{.mark} an **[analysis of historical
evidence]{.underline}** [from]{.underline} the aftermath of
[[the]{.mark} 1964 [Chinese]{.mark}]{.underline} nuclear [[test]{.mark},
this article argues]{.underline} that [[scholars]{.mark} have
[go]{.mark}ne [too far in rejecting]{.mark} the nuclear [domino
theory]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Reactive prolif]{.underline}eration [has
been]{.underline} **[more prevalent]{.underline}** [than]{.underline}
commonly [believed, and [while]{.mark}]{.underline} it is true that
[[only India]{.mark} [acquired]{.mark}]{.underline} a nuclear arsenal
[in response to]{.underline} the [Chinese test,]{.underline} to a
significant extent [[this is]{.mark} precisely
[because]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[was aware of]{.mark} the danger of
[reactive prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline}** and worked to stop it.
Finally, the **[historical evidence]{.underline}**
[suggests]{.underline} that the nuclear [domino [theory is compatible
with]{.mark}]{.underline} both [**[domestic and prestige]{.underline}**
[motivations]{.underline}]{.mark} for proliferation [[in addition
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[security]{.underline}]{.mark} motives
normally associated with the theory. When one state acquires nuclear
weapons, do other states inevitably follow? The [[belief]{.mark}
in]{.underline} the affirmative (hereafter termed [the nuclear domino
theory]{.underline}) [[was]{.underline}]{.mark} once **[an article of
[faith]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[among]{.underline}]{.mark} world
[[leaders]{.mark} and analysts]{.underline} of nuclear proliferation. In
the last decade, however, a growing chorus of scholars has attacked the
validity of the nuclear domino theory from a diverse array of
methodological and theoretical perspectives. 1 The goal of this article
is to contest this emerging revisionist consensus. More specifically,
the article advances three primary claims: [(1)]{.underline} that
[[reactive prolif]{.underline}]{.mark}eration behavior in the form of
nuclear exploration and pursuit [[has been]{.underline} **[more
common]{.underline}**]{.mark} [than]{.underline} recent [scholarship has
acknowledged]{.underline}; [(2)]{.underline} that, [contrary
to]{.underline} [common belief]{.underline}, the nuclear [domino theory
is compatible with a multicausal approach]{.underline} to proliferation,
embracing security, domestic, and normative motivations; and (3) most
importantly, that US nonproliferation policy has played a central role
in rendering nuclear domino predictions self-defeating.

happen without]{.underline}]{.mark} a sizable nuclear
[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}. A single nuclear weapon would not produce
enough smoke to cause significant nuclear winter effects---hence there
was no nuclear winter following the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. [A
[lower bound for]{.mark} the [number]{.mark} of nuclear weapons [needed

[and]{.underline}]{.mark} how much flammable material is in the
[[vicinity]{.underline}]{.mark} of their detonation, among other
factors. [[Recent research finds significant nuclear winter effects

### Asian Prolif\-\--A2: No War

#### Asian prolif causes nuclear war 

Stephen J. **Cimbala 15**, Distinguished Professor of Political Science
at Pennsylvania State University Brandywine, *The New Nuclear Disorder:
Challenges to Deterrence and Strategy*, 2015, pp. 59-63

Although the construct or policy option of a preventive nuclear war
became institutionally unthinkable in Washington and in Moscow, [[the
possibility of inadvertent nuclear war]{.mark} or escalation to nuclear
from conventional war was **very real during the Cold
War**]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} legacy [has [**carried forward**
into]{.mark} [the]{.mark} post-Cold War and [twenty-first
century]{.mark} world]{.underline}. The term "inadvertent" means
something other than "accidental" war, such as the possibility of a test
misfire or other technology failure that leads to a war. [Inadvertent
nuclear war is the result of an unforeseen combination of human and
technical factors]{.underline}, pulling both sides in a nuclear crisis
over the brink despite their shared interest in avoiding war.¶ The
likelihood of inadvertent nuclear war between two states is based on
their political intentions, military capabilities, approaches to crisis
management, the personalities of leaders, standard operating procedures
for the management of nuclear forces during peacetime and in crisis, and
other variables.16 A decision for nuclear preemption is so irrevocable
that leaders will want as much intelligence as possible relative to the
plans and actions of their opponent. Unfortunately, [inside dope on [the
opponent's]{.mark} political [thinking and]{.mark} military [planning
may be hard to come by]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [under the exigent
pressures of crisis]{.underline}. Therefore, [[states may infer]{.mark}
the other side's [intentions]{.mark} from the disposition of its
forces]{.underline}, from [the behavior of its command, control,
communications and intelligence systems, or [from **guesswork**]{.mark}
based on past experience]{.underline}.¶ For example: during Able Archer
83, a NATO command and communications exercise testing procedures for
the release of alliance nuclear weapons in November 1983, there was an
apparent mind set among some Soviet intelligence officials that led them
to conclude (temporarily) that the exercise might be the "real thing":
an actual set of preparatory moves for NATO nuclear release and a
possible first strike against Soviet forces and installations in
Europe.17 The pessimistic Soviet interpretations of Able Archer were not
universally shared among their intelligence officers, but some of the
alarmism arose from Soviet military doctrine that foresaw the conversion
of an exercise simulating an attack into a real attack as one possible
path to war.18¶ Another example of the difficulty of reading the other
side's intentions during a crisis occurred during the Cuban missile
crisis of 1962. A second letter from Khrushchev to Kennedy on October
27, more demanding in its terms for settlement compared to an earlier
letter the previous day, caused some ExComm deliberators to wonder
whether Khrushchev had been overruled by a hostile faction of the Soviet
Presidium. Robert Kennedy noted that "The change in the language and
tenor of the letters from Khrushchev indicated confusion within the
Soviet Union, but there was confusion among us as well."19 Fortunately,
in both the NATO "Able Archer" exercise and in the Cuban crisis, the
most pessimistic assumptions were proved incorrect before leaders could
act on them.¶ A post-Cold War example of a scenario for inadvertent
nuclear war occurred in January 1995 during the launch of a Norwegian
scientific rocket for the purpose of studying the Aurora borealis. The
initial phase of the rocket's trajectory resembled that of a ballistic
missile launched from a nuclear submarine and possibly headed for
Russian territory. Russian early warning systems detected the launch and
passed the information to military headquarters. Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, the defense minister and the chief of the Russian general staff
were connected via their emergency communication network, and the
Russian President for the first time opened his secure briefcase or
"football" with nuclear codes for launch authorization. The crisis
passed when the rocket trajectory eventually veered away from any
possible threat to Russia. The operational misinterpretation of the
Norwegian rocket launch was made possible by an earlier bureaucratic
mistake. Norwegian officials had notified the Russian foreign ministry
well in advance of the launch date that the rocket test was scheduled
and of its mission. For unknown reasons, the Russian foreign ministry
failed to pass that information to the defense ministry or other
military headquarters in time to avoid confusion.¶ The Future: Issues of
Concern¶ [If [the possibility existed of]{.mark} a [mistaken preemption
during]{.mark} and immediately after [the Cold War]{.mark}, between the
experienced nuclear forces and command systems of America and Russia,
then [it may be]{.mark} a matter of [even more concern with]{.mark}
regard to [states with]{.mark} **newer and [more opaque forces and
command systems]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In addition, [the Americans
and]{.underline} Soviets (and then [Russians]{.underline}) [had a great
deal of experience getting to know one another's military]{.underline}
operational [proclivities and]{.underline} doctrinal
[idiosyncrasies]{.underline}: including those that might influence the
decision for or against war.¶ Another consideration, relative to nuclear
stability in the present century, is that the Americans and their NATO
allies shared with the Soviets and Russians a commonality of culture and
historical experience. [Future threats]{.underline} to American or
Russian security from weapons of mass destruction [may be presented by
states or non-state actors motivated by cultural and social
predispositions not easily understood by those in the West nor subject
to favorable manipulation during a crisis]{.underline}.¶ [[The **spread
of nuclear weapons in Asia**]{.underline}]{.mark} (including those parts
of the Middle East with geostrategic proximity or reach into Asia)
[[presents]{.mark} a complicated mosaic of possibilities in this
regard]{.underline}. [States with]{.underline} nuclear forces of
[variable force structure, operational experience, and command-control
systems will be thrown into [a matrix of]{.mark} complex political,
social and cultural [cross-currents **contributory to** ]{.mark}**the
possibility of [war]{.mark}.**]{.underline} In addition to the existing
nuclear powers **[[in Asia, others may seek nuclear weapons if they feel
threatened]{.underline}]{.mark}** by regional rivals or hostile
alliances. Containment of nuclear proliferation in Asia is a desirable
political objective for all of the obvious reasons. Nevertheless, [the
present century is unlikely to see the nuclear hesitancy or risk
aversion that marked the Cold War]{.underline}: in part, because the
military and political discipline imposed by the Cold War superpowers no
longer exists, but also because [states in Asia have new aspirations for
regional or global respect.]{.underline}20¶ The spread of ballistic
missiles and other nuclear capable delivery systems [[in
Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}, or in the Middle East with reach into Asia,
is especially dangerous because [[plausible adversaries live close
together and are **already engaged in** ]{.mark}**ongoing
[disputes]{.mark}** about territory or other issues]{.underline}. The
Cold War Americans and Soviets required missiles and airborne delivery
systems of intercontinental range to strike at one another's vitals. But
short range ballistic missiles or fighter-bombers suffice for India and
Pakistan to launch attacks at one another with potentially "strategic"
effects. China shares borders with Russia, North Korea, India and
Pakistan; Russia, with China and North Korea; India, with Pakistan and
China; Pakistan, with India and China; and so on.¶ [The [short flight
times]{.mark} of ballistic missiles]{.underline} between the cities or
military forces of contiguous states [[means]{.mark} that **very [little
time will be available]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} warning and attack
[assessment]{.mark} by the defender]{.underline}.
[[Conventional]{.mark}ly armed [missiles could]{.mark}]{.underline}
easily [[be mistaken for]{.mark} a]{.underline} tactical
[[nuclear]{.mark} first use]{.underline}. Fighter-bombers appearing over
the horizon could just as easily be carrying nuclear weapons as
conventional ordnance. In addition to the challenges posed by shorter
flight times and uncertain weapons loads, [potential victims of nuclear
attack in Asia may also have [first strike vulnerable]{.mark} forces and
command-control [systems]{.mark} that [increase]{.mark} decision
[pressures]{.mark} [for]{.mark} **rapid, and possibly mistaken,
[retaliation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.¶ [[This]{.mark} potpourri of
possibilities **[challenges conventional wisdom about]{.mark} nuclear
[deterrence]{.mark}** [and proliferation]{.mark}]{.underline} on the
part of policy makers and academic theorists. For policy makers in the
United States and NATO, [spreading nuclear]{.underline} and other
[weapons]{.underline} of mass destruction in Asia [could profoundly
shift the geopolitics of mass destruction]{.underline} from a European
center of gravity (in the twentieth century) to an Asian and/or Middle
Eastern center of gravity (in the present century).21 [This would
profoundly shake up prognostications]{.underline} to the effect [that
wars of mass destruction are now passé]{.underline}, on account of the
emergence of the "Revolution in Military Affairs" and its encouragement
of information-based warfare.22 Together with this, there has emerged
the argument that large scale war between states or coalitions of
states, as opposed to varieties of unconventional warfare and failed
states, are exceptional and potentially obsolete.23 The spread of WMD
and ballistic missiles in Asia could overturn these expectations for the
obsolescence or marginalization of major interstate warfare.

**[[despite]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[deepening economic
interdependence]{.underline}]{.mark} among sub-regional states (with the
notable exception of North Korea). [Trade between northeast Asian states
has been growing steadily]{.underline} since the 1997 regional economic

[exemplified by]{.underline} the large-scale [Japanese and South Korean
investment]{.underline} in the information technology production
networks in the Pearl River Delta, the Yangtze River Delta, and the
Bohai---Yellow Sea region. 3 **[[While economic relations are]{.mark}
very [warm]{.mark}]{.underline}** among northeast Asia\'s states,
**[[political relations are distant]{.mark} and cold]{.underline}**,
[[which has]{.underline} **[major implications]{.underline}**

Northeast Asian Security Dialogue gained little traction in the 1990s
and the Six Party Talks have failed to deliver any real outcomes in
achieving effective confidence-building measures, let alone placing any
meaningful constraints on North Korea\'s nuclear program. Any sustained
dialogue between sub-regional states on the security challenges
engendering mistrust has proven elusive. Ironically, the most
substantive dialogue between China, Japan, and South Korea has taken
place under the rubric of a southeast Asia-based institution, ASEAN-+3.
[[Inter-Korean and inter-Chinese tensions]{.underline}]{.mark}, which

Japanese Prime Minister [Shinzo [Abe]{.mark} has been [pressing
for]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[more military
spending]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in Japan]{.underline}, in what critics
claim is a violation of Japan's so-called pacifist constitution. Foreign
Policy reports: In January, [the [government]{.mark}]{.underline} of
conservative Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe [[endorsed]{.mark} a
[**defense budget** of nearly **5 trillion yen**, or **\$42 billion**,
continuing a **three-year growth trend**]{.mark}]{.underline} after
nearly a decade of decline. The sum still represents a small portion of
Japan's GDP --- it accounts for just one percent of it, according to the
World Bank --- but because offensive military action is prohibited by
Japan's constitution, even a modest increase is controversial. [Japan
Has a Big Military Already]{.underline} We often speak of the Japanese
military as if it were some sort of skeleton crew of caretakers. This is
not the case at all. [Japan spends more on its military than India, for
instance, which is in an arms race]{.underline} with Pakistan and has
many border issues with which to deal. Indeed, according to the
International Institute for Strategic Studies, [[Japan is the
number-seven country in terms of military spending]{.mark}, placing it
ahead of hot-spot countries like Israel and South Korea.]{.underline}
The IISS estimates that Japan's military spending is \$47 billion,
compared to Russia's \$70 billion and China\'s \$129 billion. (The US,
of course, spends far more than everyone else with \$581 billion.) So,
we find that Japan's military is hardly insignificant. Yes, Russia has a
larger military, but Russian military might is primarily directed toward
Eastern Europe, thousands of miles away, and China has many neighbors
other than Japan to deal with, and it has a much larger territory that
does not enjoy the natural defensive advantage of being an island
nation. Moreover, [everyone knows that]{.underline} [**[Japan could
build deliverable nuclear weapons very quickly]{.mark}** if necessary,
[and]{.mark} it [has]{.mark} access to some of [the **best military
technology**]{.mark} in the world.]{.underline}

country would be]{.underline} officially [pacifist]{.underline}, meaning
its military would be limited to self-defense only. While the
constitution was imposed by the US occupation forces, this was also an

**[[importance]{.mark} [of America]{.mark}\'s role]{.underline}** [in

Asia to the extent needed to adequately defend Japanese interests.
[Japan began researching nuclear weapons]{.underline} development
[during WWII]{.underline}. Today, [[with]{.mark} [one of the]{.mark}
world\'s **[most advanced]{.mark} civilian [nuclear power
programs]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and a **highly
technologically**]{.mark} **[sophisticated
society]{.mark}**]{.underline}, many believe that [[Japan could
develop]{.mark} nuclear [weapons in a **matter of
months**]{.mark}]{.underline} should it choose to do so. Despite being a
non-nuclear state, [[Japan has]{.mark} long [been committed
to]{.mark}]{.underline} developing and maintaining [[a full-spectrum
fuel cycle]{.mark} capability]{.underline}. [The Rokkasho]{.underline}
reprocessing [facility]{.underline} is due to come online in 2016 and
[will be capable of producing eight tons of weapons-grade plutonium
annually]{.underline}. Japan already has 48 tons of plutonium stockpiled
and a defense and space industry capable of producing advanced delivery
systems. As China gets ever more expansive in its territorial ambitions,
and North Korea continues to flex its military muscle, other Asian
countries are put on the defensive over issues that may be unlikely to
trigger the extended deterrence promised by the U.S. **[[If the]{.mark}
U.S.-Japan [alliance weakens]{.mark}]{.underline}**, for example as a
result of closer U.S.-China ties or a softening of the negotiating
position on North Korea\'s denuclearization, [[it may
strengthen]{.underline}]{.mark} the argument of [[advocates pushing
for]{.mark} Japan]{.underline} to [develop its own [independent
deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}.

A [new nuclear-arms race]{.underline}, moreover, [could be]{.underline}

### South Korea Prolif\-\--A2: No Prolif\-\--Cost

#### No economic constraints 

**Ferguson 15** (Charles, President of the Federation of American
Scientists, 5/5/15, "How South Korea Could Acquire and Deploy Nuclear
Weapons," <http://npolicy.org/books/East_Asia/Ch4_Ferguson.pdf>)

First, [[South Korea has become]{.mark} one of the most
[globalized]{.mark} nations in the world with one of the largest
economies, [supplying coveted goods]{.mark}]{.underline} (such as
electronic products made by Samsung and LG Corporation) to markets
[[around the world, especially]{.mark} to [the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates. [This argues
against South Korea acquiring nuclear weapons because it would
**jeopardize its economy**]{.underline} due to the resulting
international sanctions. [On the other hand, [South Korea would most
likely **weather the storm of sanctions** considering the precedent of
India]{.mark}]{.underline}. In May 1998, [[India
conducted]{.underline}]{.mark} nuclear explosive [[tests]{.mark} and
was]{.underline} then [sanctioned]{.underline}. [[But the sanctions did
not last]{.underline}]{.mark} much [[longer than a
year]{.underline}]{.mark}. While India was not producing many coveted
goods at that time, [its]{.underline} huge population offered an
[enticing market and]{.underline}, as a democracy, [was seen by the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [as an important counter to
communist China's rising military strength]{.underline}. In the case of
[[South Korea]{.underline}]{.mark}, it has a tiny population compared to
India, but most of it[s people [are relatively wealthy and take part in
a vibrant democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}, and as mentioned,
[many]{.underline} South Korean [[companies create goods that Americans
want to consume. Thu]{.mark}s]{.underline}, the [[**sanctions would
likely be pro forma** and be removed after]{.mark} a period
of]{.underline} a few to several **[[months]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

International Journal, 69.1, DOI: 10.1177/0020702013518495, SAGE

The Seoul government fully understands the reasons against a nuclear
South Korea and often reaffirms its desire for direct denuclearization
talks with the North. This has been consistent government policy.
**[[So]{.underline}]{.mark}**uth **[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea [[is
equipped]{.underline} [with]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**[technical and
industrial]{.underline}** [capacity to produce nuclear
warheads]{.underline}]{.mark} **[with[in]{.mark} a few
[years]{.mark}]{.underline}** [of any decision to go
nuclear.]{.underline}12 The [[South is]{.mark} the world's
**[fifth-largest]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[producer of atomic energy,
and]{.mark} it [has not suffered a nuclear accident
since]{.mark}]{.underline} the beginning of nuclear energy production in
19[[78]{.underline}]{.mark}. The literature on nuclearization does not
derive consistent predictions from these circumstances. On the one hand,
the theory that states equipped with cutting-edge nuclear technology
tend to be nuclear-armed would point to the likelihood that Seoul will
go nuclear. However, motivational theory, which emphasizes incentives
and intentions, rather than technology, in relation to nuclear armament,
leads to the opposite conclusion. [In fact, the **South has the
capability**]{.underline}, but not the intention to go nuclear. Two
further issues related to the South's going nuclear remain unresolved:
the transfer of wartime operational control and the prestige of the
scientific community. The US is scheduled to transfer wartime
operational control to South Korea in December 2015, according to the
South Korea--US agreement. South Korean conservatives have been worrying
that the subsequent dissolution of the South Korea-US Combined Forces
Command will undermine the South's national defence. The concern is
likely to grow as the date of the transfer approaches and may buttress
the argument for Seoul's nuclear armament. At the same time,
[[scientists may argue]{.underline}]{.mark} that [further
[developments]{.mark} in technology and scientific knowledge [will
enhance]{.mark} the [prestige]{.mark} of the South Korean scientific
community. [In]{.mark}]{.underline} the case of
[[India]{.underline}]{.mark}'s nuclear development, the [scientific
[community **was motivated**]{.mark} **to produce nuclear weapons** in
order [to demonstrate]{.mark} its **[capabilities]{.mark}**.13 [In
**So**]{.mark}]{.underline}uth **[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea, the
[uranium [enrichment]{.mark}]{.underline} experiment in 2000 [[was
attributed]{.underline} [to]{.underline}]{.mark} several [scientists'
[desire]{.mark}]{.underline} **[to confirm their
capabilities]{.underline}**. [Nuclear [tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology
in South Korea [[is **constantly**]{.mark}
**[developing]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and scientists' desire]{.mark} to
increase their prestige **[may become a factor]{.mark}** in the
debate.]{.underline}

The [barrage of [threats from North]{.mark} Korea]{.underline} has
[[sparked talk]{.underline}]{.mark} from [[within South]{.mark} Korea
[of]{.mark} the]{.underline} **[need to develop its own [nuclear

[of]{.underline} South Korean [citizens]{.underline} surveyed [[support
the]{.mark} [idea]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially in the wake of North

**[[have been calling for]{.mark} a [nuclear weapons]{.mark}

[According to a]{.underline} February [poll]{.underline} conducted
[by]{.underline} South Korea\'s private think tank, [Asan Institute,
**66%**]{.underline} of South Koreans [said they support developing a
nuclear weapons program]{.underline}. The poll suggests that just under
half of South Koreans in 2012 believed that the United States would
provide South Korea with what\'s known as the \"nuclear umbrella\" in
the case of a North Korean nuclear attack, indicating a 7% decrease from
2011. [[Under the]{.mark} nuclear [umbrella]{.mark}]{.underline}[,

and ambitions poses very high and unpredictable risks and increased
instability." One particularly risky and region right now is East Asia,

### Taiwan Prolif\-\--A2: No Prolif\-\--Means

<http://thediplomat.com/2016/03/asias-nuclear-arena-hedging-and-deterring/>)

Japan, South Korea and [[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark} are [[latent
nuclear power]{.underline}]{.mark}s [[in that their advanced
nuclear]{.mark} energy [programs and rocket technologies provide
capabilities that could be applied to weapons]{.mark} development. [If
judged necessary for national survival, they could build nuclear weapons
in perhaps **two years**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- or less in Japan's case
because it already possesses uranium enrichment and plutonium
reprocessing technologies. Beyond latency, Japan employs a quasi-hedging
strategy, which is defined as latency with intent. In Japan's case, the
hedging is "quasi" because the nuclear capabilities were developed
primarily for economic reasons. Nuclear hedging was a secondary purpose.
Over the years, Japanese officials have often noted that the facilities
provide a future weapons option, although saying so publicly was also a
means of creating diplomatic leverage with the U.S. to encourage
Washington to strengthen its security guarantees. Many South Koreans
want the same reprocessing and enrichment capabilities for a sense of
equality with Japan and to provide a nuclear hedge vis-à-vis North
Korea. [[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark} is abandoning nuclear power
altogether and no longer talks about a nuclear hedge. But it probably
[[keeps blueprints for the old weapons facilities]{.underline}]{.mark}
in a cupboard somewhere.

#### Taiwan can prolif quickly and easily

**Keck 14** (Zachary, formerly Managing Editor of The Diplomat where he
authored The Pacific Realist blog, Previously, he worked as Deputy
Editor of e-International Relations and has interned at the Center for a
New American Security and in the U.S. Congress, where he worked on
defense issues., Are Taiwan's Days Numbered?,
<http://thediplomat.com/2014/02/are-taiwans-days-numbered/>)

Finally, I would not rule out the possibility that if China becomes too
powerful, [[Taiwan might seek an independent nuclear
deterrent]{.underline}]{.mark} before it chooses the "Hong Kong
strategy." It would hardly be the first nation that acquired nuclear
weapons to negate a rival's vastly superior military power because it
couldn't do so through conventional means alone. Furthermore, [[Taiwan
has a]{.mark} fairly [robust]{.mark} [civilian]{.mark} nuclear
[program]{.mark} [that would make it easy]{.mark}]{.underline}---at
least [[relative to]{.underline}]{.mark} some of the [[recent]{.mark}
[proliferators]{.mark}]{.underline}[---[to acquire]{.underline}]{.mark}
[a nuclear arsenal]{.underline}. The real challenge would be trying to
do so covertly since Beijing might attack Taiwan if it discovered the
island's dash for the bomb.

### Taiwan Prolif\-\--A2: No Prolif\-\--Motive

#### History proves motive

**Reiter 14** (Dan, Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Political Science
at Emory, Security Commitments and Nuclear Proliferation\*, Foreign
Policy Analysis (2014) 10, 71-72)

South Korea and [[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark} may be the exceptions that
prove the rule. They appear to have [[pursued nuclear weapons]{.mark}
even [in the context of]{.mark}]{.underline} a third party [[security
commitment **because they perceived the credibility of that commitment
to be declining**]{.underline}]{.mark} (for more on South Korea, see
next section). Beyond this specific point, the results perhaps highlight
the diplomatic and geopolitical costs of nuclear acquisition, relative
to nuclear pursuit. The results are consistent with the proposition that
states pay higher costs when they acquire nuclear weapons in comparison
with pursuing nuclear weapons. [Nuclear weapons [pursuit can occur in
secret]{.mark}, virtually always in the realm of plausible
deniability]{.underline}. Nuclear weapons
[[acquisition]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[is]{.mark} usually a
[public]{.mark} event,]{.underline} often a nuclear test. [[Common
knowledge that a state has gone nuclear can mean higher
costs]{.underline}]{.mark}, [in terms of]{.underline} diplomatic
[isolation]{.underline}, being targeted for economic [sanctions
and]{.underline} international opprobrium, and [stimulating]{.underline}
the nuclear [programs of rivals]{.underline} and neighbors. [[States may
be less willing to pay those costs if]{.underline}
[foreign]{.underline}]{.mark} nuclear weapons [[deployments offer the
security benefits that an indigenous nuclear arsenal would
provide]{.underline}.]{.mark} However, because the diplomatic and
geopolitical costs of nuclear weapons pursuit are lower, states may be
more open to nuclear pursuit short of acquisition, even if American
nuclear forces have been deployed. This may have been the case for South
Korea and [[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}, two states that
[[sought]{.mark} to pursue nuclear [arsenals]{.mark} secretly as hedges
[in the face of the **decline in the credibility of the American
security guarantee**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

#### Confidence in the US is the key variable

**Copley 7** (Gregory, President of the International Strategic Studies
Association, based in Washington, DC, and Editor-in-Chief of the
\"Defense & Foreign Affairs\" group of publications, including the
government-only intelligence service, the Global Information System, The
New Asian Strategic Balance, lexis)

\* Consideration of strategic counter-strike capabilities. [[The US
has]{.mark} historically [used all its efforts to ensure that the ROC
did not obtain]{.mark}]{.underline} either [[nuclear
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} or longer-range ballistic missile delivery
systems as part of its deterrence of PRC strategic power. The
**[[weakening US leverage]{.mark} over the ROC \-- [as Washington is
seen more as a friend of Beijing than of Taipei
]{.mark}]{.underline}**[\-- [means]{.underline}]{.mark} [that
[Taipei]{.mark}]{.underline}, over the longer term, [[must consider
whether it should develop]{.mark} the ability to ensure a sound
[deterrence of any PRC]{.mark}]{.underline} military
[[adventurism]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is likely that the
cost-effectiveness of an offensive strategic weapons program, however,
may be less than the development of sound defenses which could ensure
that a PLA offensive is blunted.

allies, and may motivate rivals to proliferate (Schwartz 1998;

Reducing military commitments and [letting allies build]{.underline}
their own [nuclear weapons might save money]{.underline} for the United
States. **[But]{.underline}** **[i]{.underline}**nternational
**[r]{.underline}**elations [scholarship suggests]{.underline} that
[[allied prolif]{.underline}]{.mark}eration [[would have]{.mark}
**broader [negative repercussions]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [Among these
would be]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[declining]{.mark} U.S.
[influence]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [When nations
gain]{.underline}]{.mark} their own military [[capabilities,
they]{.mark} rely less on]{.underline} their [allies and [become less
subject]{.mark} to]{.underline} their [sway]{.underline}. And [[that can
undermine]{.underline}]{.mark} a senior [partner's [ability to
hold]{.mark}]{.underline} its [junior [allies back]{.mark}]{.underline}
[from]{.underline} **[risky]{.underline}** military
[actions]{.underline}. In other words, [allowing]{.underline} or

[worsen]{.mark}]{.underline} the "[[American]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Recent]{.underline} nonproliferation [research underscores this

#### Every global hotpot goes [nuclear]{.underline} and it triggers [their impact]{.underline} by collapsing the economy

**Brands 15 --** Hal Brands, PhD in International Relations, Faculty at
the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University and the Elliott
School of International Affairs at George Washington University, "Fools
Rush Out? The Flawed Logic of Offshore Balancing", Washington Quarterly,
p. 7-28

The fundamental reason is that [both U.S. influence and international
stability are thoroughly interwoven with a robust U.S. forward
presence.]{.underline} Regarding influence, [the protection that
Washington has afforded its allies has equally afforded the United
States great sway over those allies' policies]{.underline}.43 [During
the Cold War and after]{.underline}, for instance, [the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has used the influence
provided by its security posture to veto allies' pursuit of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}, [to obtain more advantageous terms in financial
and trade agreements]{.underline}, and even to affect the composition of
allied nations' governments.44 More broadly, it has used its alliances
as vehicles for shaping political, security, and economic agendas in key
regions and bilateral relationships, thus giving the United States an
outsized voice on a range of important issues. To be clear, this
influence has never been as pervasive as U.S. officials might like, or
as some observers might imagine. But by any reasonable standard of
comparison, it has nonetheless been remarkable. [One can tell a similar
story about the relative stability of the post-war order]{.underline}.
As even some leading offshore balancers have acknowledged[, the lack of
conflict in regions like Europe in recent decades is not something that
has occurred naturally]{.underline}. [It has occurred because the
["American pacifier"]{.mark} has suppressed precisely the dynamics that
previously fostered geopolitical turmoil. That pacifier has [limited
**arms races** and]{.mark} security **[competitions]{.mark}** by
providing the protection that allows other countries to under-build
their militaries. It has soothed historical rivalries by affording a
climate of security in which powerful countries like Germany and Japan
could be revived economically and reintegrated into thriving and fairly
cooperative regional orders.]{.underline} [It has induced caution in the
behavior of allies and adversaries alike, **[deterring
aggression]{.mark}** and dissuading other destabilizing
behavior]{.underline}. As John Mearsheimer has noted, the United States
"effectively acts as a night watchman," lending order to an otherwise
disorderly and anarchical environment.45 [What would happen [if
Washington backed away]{.mark} from this role]{.underline}? The most
logical answer is that [both U.S. influence and [**global stability**
would suffer]{.mark}]{.underline}. [With respect to
influence,]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [would]{.underline} effectively [be surrendering
the most powerful bargaining chip it has traditionally wielded in
dealing with friends and allies,]{.underline} [and jeopardizing the
position of leadership it has used to shape bilateral and regional
agendas for decades. The consequences would seem no less damaging where
stability is concerned]{.underline}. As offshore balancers have argued,
it may be that U.S. retrenchment would force local powers to spend more
on defense, while perhaps assuaging certain points of friction with
countries that feel threatened or encircled by U.S. presence. But it
equally stands to reason that [removing the American pacifier would
liberate the more destabilizing influences that U.S. policy had
previously stifled. Long-dormant [security competitions might
reawaken]{.mark} as countries armed themselves more
vigorously]{.underline}; [historical antagonisms]{.underline} [between
old rivals might reemerge in the absence of a robust U.S. presence and
the reassurance it provides]{.underline}. Moreover, [countries that seek
to revise existing regional orders in their favor]{.underline}---think
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** in **[[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
or **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Asia---might indeed applaud U.S.
retrenchment, but [they [might]{.mark} just as plausibly feel empowered
to more [assertively press]{.mark} their interests]{.underline}. If the
United States has been a kind of Leviathan in key regions, Mearsheimer
acknowledges, then "[take away that Leviathan and there is likely to be
big trouble]{.underline}."46 Scanning the global horizon today, [one can
easily see where such trouble might arise. In Europe,]{.underline} [a
revisionist Russia is already destabilizing its neighbors and contesting
the post-Cold War settlement in the region.]{.underline} [In the Gulf
and broader Middle East, the threat of [Iran]{.mark}ian ascendancy has
[stoked]{.mark} region-wide tensions manifesting in [proxy wars]{.mark}
and hints of an incipient arms race, even as that region also contends
with a severe threat to its stability in the form of the Islamic State.
In East Asia, a rising China is challenging the regional status quo in
numerous ways, sounding alarms among its neighbors---many of whom also
have historical grievances against each other.]{.underline} In these
circumstances, [removing the American pacifier would likely yield not
low-cost stability, but increased conflict and upheaval. That conflict
and upheaval]{.underline}, in turn, [would be quite damaging to U.S.
interests]{.underline} even if it did not result in the nightmare
scenario of a hostile power dominating a key region. [[It is hard to
imagine]{.underline}]{.mark}, for instance, [that [increased
instability]{.mark} and acrimony [would produce]{.mark} the
[robust]{.mark} multilateral [cooperation]{.mark} necessary [to deal
with]{.mark} transnational threats from **[pandemics]{.mark}** to
piracy. More [problematic]{.mark} still [might be]{.mark} the
**[economic consequences]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As scholars like
Michael Mandelbaum have argued, [the [enormous]{.mark} progress toward
global [prosperity]{.mark} and integration that has occurred since World
War II]{.underline} (and now the Cold War) [[has come in the climate
of]{.mark} relative stability and [security provided]{.mark} largely by
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.47 [[One]{.mark} simply
[cannot]{.mark} confidently [predict]{.mark} that [this]{.mark} progress
[would endure]{.mark} amid escalating geopolitical competition in
regions of enormous importance to the world economy]{.underline}.
Perhaps [the greatest risk that a strategy of offshore balancing would
run]{.underline}, of course, [is that a key region might not be able to
maintain its own balance following U.S. retrenchment]{.underline}. That
prospect might have seemed far-fetched in the early post-Cold War era,
and it remains unlikely in the immediate future. But [in East Asia
particularly, the rise and growing assertiveness of China has
highlighted the medium- to long-term danger that a hostile power could
in fact gain regional primacy. If China's economy continues to grow
rapidly]{.underline}, and if Beijing continues to increase military
spending by 10 percent or more each year, [then its neighbors will
ultimately face grave challenges in containing Chinese power even if
they join forces in that endeavor]{.underline}. This possibility,
ironically, is one to which leading advocates of retrenchment have been
attuned. "The United States will have to play a key role in countering
China," Mearshimer writes, "because its Asian neighbors are not strong
enough to do it by themselves."48 If this is true, however, then
[offshore balancing becomes a dangerous and potentially self-defeating
strategy]{.underline}. As mentioned above, [[it could lead]{.mark}
countries like [Japan and]{.mark} South [Korea to seek **nuclear
weapons**]{.mark}]{.underline}, thereby [stoking arms races and
elevating regional tensions]{.underline}. Alternatively, and perhaps
more worryingly, [it might encourage the scenario that offshore
balancers seek to avoid, by easing China's ascent to regional
hegemony.]{.underline} As Robert Gilpin has written, "[Retrenchment by
its very nature is an indication of relative weakness and declining
power, and thus retrenchment can have a deteriorating effect on
relations with allies and rivals]{.underline}."49 [In East Asia today,
U.S. allies rely on U.S. reassurance to navigate increasingly fraught
relationships with a more assertive China precisely because they
understand that they will have great trouble balancing Beijing on their
own]{.underline}. A significant U.S. retrenchment might therefore tempt
these countries to acquiesce to, or bandwagon with, a rising China if
they felt that prospects for successful resistance were diminishing as
the United States retreated.50 In the same vein, retrenchment would
compromise alliance relationships, basing agreements, and other assets
that might help Washington check Chinese power in the first place---and
that would allow the United States to surge additional forces into
theater in a crisis. In sum, if one expects that Asian countries will be
unable to counter China themselves, then reducing U.S. influence and
leverage in the region is a curious policy. Offshore balancing might
promise to preserve a stable and advantageous environment while reducing
U.S. burdens. But upon closer analysis, the probable outcomes of the
strategy seem more perilous and destabilizing than its proponents
acknowledge.

The [[liberal world order]{.underline}]{.mark} that was created in the
aftermath of the Second World War [is]{.underline} today [[being
challenged]{.mark} by]{.underline} a [variety of forces]{.underline} ---
by powerful [authoritarian governments and anti-liberal fundamentalist
movements]{.underline}, as well as by long-term shifts in the global
economy. **[[Great power competition has
returned]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[In]{.underline}
**[Europe]{.underline}**]{.mark}, **[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** has
[**[launched]{.mark} the first [cross-border invasion]{.mark}**
of]{.underline} a [neighboring country]{.underline} since World War II.
[[In]{.underline}]{.mark} East **[[Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[China]{.mark} is [expanding]{.mark} its reach as a [military
power]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [seeking]{.underline} both economic and
strategic [hegemony at the risk of [destabilizing]{.mark} that critical
[region]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[In]{.mark} the [Middle East]{.mark},
[Iran]{.mark} is [expanding]{.mark} its [influence]{.mark} and Islamic
[jihadists]{.mark} have [gained control of]{.mark} more
[territory]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In the face of this turmoil, many
Americans have come to doubt whether there is anything the United States
can do or should do in response. Many assume either that it doesn't
matter very much what happens beyond America's shores or that the United
States no longer has the wisdom or capacity to shape events and prevent
others from doing what they please. Only seven years ago, [[pundits were
talking of]{.mark} a "[post-American world]{.mark}," [with]{.mark} a
[declining U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} a remarkable
"[rise of the rest]{.mark}."]{.underline} These days, however, [that
[prognosis appears to have been]{.mark} at best
**[premature]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Only seven years ago, pundits were
talking of a "post-American world," with a declining United States and a
remarkable "rise of the rest." These days, however, that prognosis
appears to have been at best premature. **[[America]{.mark} has
[substantially recovered from]{.mark} the]{.underline}** Great
**[[Recession]{.underline}]{.mark}**, while [the **once-heralded "[rise
of the rest]{.mark}" has [stalled]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Many around
the world who once decried American overseas involvement as "hegemonic"
now seek greater American engagement in international
affairs.]{.underline} Widespread Support for US Actions Against ISIS Pew
Research Center: Support for U.S. Actions against ISIS [[Among]{.mark}
the]{.underline} American [[public]{.underline}]{.mark}, too, **[there
[are]{.mark} signs of [greater receptivity to]{.mark} a [more active
American]{.mark} global [role]{.mark}]{.underline}**. What is missing
for most Americans, however, is a sense of strategy and purpose in
American foreign policy. During the Cold War, fear of the Soviet Union
and international communism did not always produce agreement on policy
but did provide an answer, for most, as to why the United States needed
to play an international role and what that role should be. Today, our
[political leaders need to remind Americans that our [fundamental
interests are]{.mark} still [best served by upholding the world
order]{.mark} --- economic, political, and strategic]{.underline} ---
that was established at the end of the Second World War and that was
further strengthened and entrenched by the revolutions of 1989.
[Americans need to recognize their nation's central role in maintaining
the present international order and muster the will to use their still
formidable power and influence to support that order against its
inevitable challengers]{.underline}. Supporting Democracy is a Matter of
National Security What will this require? Above all, [it means working
to shore up all]{.underline} three pillars -- politics, economics,
[security]{.underline} --- of what has [made the American-led world
order so remarkable]{.underline}. There is a tendency to separate
politics, economics, and security --- "ideals" from "interests," support
for democracy from defense of security --- but in the present world
order they have all been related. Start with the reality that a world
order that supports freedom will only be supported by free nations.
[Supporting democracy]{.underline} is not just a matter of keeping faith
with our own values. It [is a matter of national security]{.underline}.
Americans and other free peoples who benefit from and support the
present world order therefore have an interest in supporting democracy
where it exists and in pressing for greater democratic reforms in the
world's authoritarian nations, including the two great power
autocracies. Supporting democracy is not just a matter of keeping faith
with our own values. It is a matter of national security. In their
economic policies, [[America]{.mark}ns]{.underline} need to [continue
promoting and **[strengthen]{.mark}ing**]{.underline} the
**[international [free trade]{.mark} and free market
regime]{.underline}**. This, of course, means setting their own economy
back on a course of sustainable growth. It means doing a better job of
educating and training Americans to compete with others in an
increasingly competitive international economy. It means providing a
healthy environment for technological innovation. But it also [[means
**resisting protectionist temptations**]{.mark} **and [using American
influence]{.mark}**]{.underline}, along with other free-trading nations,
[[to push back]{.mark} against some of the tendencies of state
capitalism in China and elsewhere]{.underline}. Gaining congressional
approval of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, and then moving to
agreement on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with
Europe, are critical, and not only for their economic benefits. They
also are a critical step in knitting the democratic world more closely
together. But it also means resisting protectionist temptations and
using American influence, along with other free-trading nations, to push
back against some of the tendencies of state capitalism in China and
elsewhere. In Asia, especially, this is more much than a trade issue.
Although the United States stands to benefit from the agreement, it is,
above all, a strategic issue. [The United States and China are locked in
a competition across the spectrum of power and influence.]{.underline}
Militarily, **[the [Chinese seek to deny American access to]{.mark} the
[region]{.mark} and [hope]{.mark} thereby [to divide]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [from]{.mark} its
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Economically, China would like to turn
Asia into a region of Chinese hegemony, where every key trade
relationship is with Beijing. In such a world, the United States is a
net loser --- providing costly security to allies but not much else,
while China reaps the economic rewards and grabs the hearts and minds,
and pocketbooks, of regional players. [Finally, there is the matter of
American hard power]{.underline}. What has been true since the time of
Rome remains true today: [**[there can be no world order]{.mark}
[without power]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} preserve it, to shape its norms,
uphold its institutions, defend the sinews of its economic system, and
**[keep the peace]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Military power]{.mark} can
be abused, wielded unwisely and ineffectively]{.underline}. It can be
deployed to answer problems that it cannot answer or that have no
answer. [But]{.underline} [it **[is]{.mark}**]{.underline} also
**[[essential]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [No nation]{.underline} or group
of nations [that renounced power could expect to maintain any kind of
world order. [If]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [begins to
look]{.mark} like a [less reliable]{.mark} [defender]{.mark} of the
present order, that **[order will]{.mark} begin to
[unravel]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It remains true today as it has since
the Second World War that **[[only]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [has]{.mark} the [capacity and]{.mark} the unique
[geographical advantages to provide]{.mark} [global
security]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[[There can be no stable balance of
power in Europe or Asia without]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}**. And while we can talk about
[[soft]{.mark} power [and smart power]{.mark}]{.underline}, they [have
been and [always will be of **limited value**]{.mark} [when
confronting]{.mark} raw [military]{.mark} power]{.underline}. Despite
all of the loose talk of American decline, [it is in the military realm
where U.S. advantages remain clearest]{.underline}. Even in other great
power's backyards, [the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [retains]{.mark}
the [capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}, along with its powerful allies, [[to
deter challenges to]{.mark} the [security]{.mark} order]{.underline}.
But [[without]{.mark} a [U.S. willingness to]{.mark} play the role of
providing [balance]{.mark} in far-flung regions of the world, **the
[system will buckle under]{.mark} the unrestrained [military]{.mark}
[competition of regional powers]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Without a U.S.
willingness to play the role of providing balance in far-flung regions
of the world, the system will buckle under the unrestrained military
competition of regional powers. Today, as a result of the Budget Control
Act and a general unwillingness to spend adequately on defense,
America's ability to play this vital role is coming increasingly under
question. Current defense spending has created a readiness crisis within
the armed forces. Only a handful of Army brigades are available for use
in a crisis. The army is about to be forced to cut 40,000 soldiers from
its active force. There are too few ships to provide a U.S. presence in
the multiple hotspots that have sprouted up around the world. As the
bipartisan, congressionally-mandated National Defense Panel has argued,
[the [U.S. military must be able to **deter or stop aggression**]{.mark}
in multiple theaters]{.underline}, not just one, even when engaged in a
large-scale war. [It [needs to]{.mark} be able to **[fight
ISIS]{.mark}** and **[deter Iran]{.mark}** in the Middle East, **[deter
Russia]{.mark}** in Europe and Syria, and in Asia **deter [No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rea** [and **maintain stability in**]{.mark} **the [face
of]{.mark} a [rising China]{.mark}**. Consider the threat]{.underline}
now [posed by Iran]{.underline}. Whatever one thinks about the
recently-concluded nuclear deal, [any serious [strategy aimed at
resisting Iranian domination]{.mark} also [requires confronting Iran
on]{.mark} the several fronts of [the]{.mark} Middle East
[battlefield]{.mark}. In Syria, it requires a determined policy to
remove Iran's close ally]{.underline}, Basher al-Assad, [[using U.S. air
power]{.mark} to provide cover for civilians and creating a safe zone
for Syrians willing to fight]{.underline}. [In Iraq, it
[requires]{.mark} using [American forces to]{.mark} push back and
[destroy]{.mark} the forces of [the Islamic State]{.mark} so that we do
not have to rely]{.underline}, de facto, [on Iranian power]{.underline}
to do the job. Overall, [it requires a greater U.S. military
commitment]{.underline} to the region, a reversal of both the perceived
and the real withdrawal of American power. And therefore it requires a
reversal of the downward trend in U.S. defense spending, which has made
it harder for the military even to think about addressing these
challenges, should it be called upon to do so. The challenge we face
today is to decide whether this liberal world order is worth defending
and whether the United States is still willing to play the role of its
principal champion. The answer to both questions ought to be "yes," but
[**[it will require]{.mark} a renewal of [American leadership]{.mark} in
the international system**, economically, politically, [and]{.mark}
strategically]{.underline}. [It will also require a **[renewed
understanding of how important]{.mark} and unique [the]{.mark} present
[liberal]{.mark} world [order is]{.mark}**, both for Americans and for
peoples all across the globe]{.underline}. The simple fact is that for
all the difficulties and suffering of the past 70 years, the period
since the end of World War II has been unique in the history of the
human race. The period since the end of World War II has been unique in
the history of the human race. Democratic government, once rare, has
spread to over 100 nations around the world, on every continent, for
peoples of all races and religions. [There has been an unprecedented
growth in prosperity]{.underline}. [Billions have been lifted out of
poverty]{.underline}. Democratic government, once rare, has spread to
over 100 nations around the world, on every continent, for peoples of
all races and religions. Although the period has been marked by war,
peace among the great powers has been preserved. There has been no
recurrence of the two devastating world wars of the first half of the
20th century. This world order has been a boon for billions around the
world, but it has also served American interests. [[Any]{.mark} [other
world order]{.mark}, one [in which the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[had to **cede power**]{.mark} **and influence to China and
Russia**]{.underline}, or what [[is]{.mark} more likely]{.underline},
**[[a descent into disorder]{.underline}]{.mark}**, is unlikely to serve
Americans' interests as well.

The Argument

This paper views the international system with geographical and
geopolitical eyes. For this reason, it uses geographical facts as
factors in analyzing the current global system and its future prospects.
The argument this paper will promote is that the [U.S. [physical
location]{.mark} and geopolitical position]{.underline} are the
cornerstones of its foreign policy and [[serve as a \"safety
net\"]{.mark} from foreign]{.underline} powers\' [assaults]{.underline}
(not perfect, obviously, as became painfully clear on September 11,
2001). The [U.S., unlike any other]{.underline} great or
[superpower]{.underline} -- now or anytime -- [can decide
whether]{.underline} or not and to what extent [will it be involved in
international affairs]{.underline}. Isolationism was a practical policy
(regardless of its success) for approximately twenty years since the end
of World War I until Pearl Harbor (1941). Even though since the end of
World War II the United States is conducting an opposite strategy,
theoretically and hypothetically it can be resumed, perhaps not to the
extent it was in the 1920s-1930s, but a sort of isolationism is
possible. No other country can afford such a policy because all other
powers are on the same continent and cannot disregard one another.

Moreover, the [[U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} is still -- and [[will
remain]{.mark} in the foreseeable future -- [the naval
superpower]{.mark} with]{.underline} the most powerful navy that has the
[best power-projection capabilities]{.underline}. It can afford to leave
the continent and become an offshore balancer. [True, it will lose
some]{.underline} of its [influence, but it can preserve]{.underline}
its [power on the sea and project it]{.underline} restrictedly [whenever
needed]{.underline}. So, very briefly, the [[U.S. has]{.mark} a much
wider room for maneuver than]{.underline} is [presumed, and with [the
most powerful military with no parallel]{.mark} in the foreseeable
future]{.underline}, the U.S. still has a wide spectrum of policies it
can use, [[hence]{.mark} it is in [the best position for]{.mark} the
[coming]{.mark} hegemonic [competition]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Literature Review

It is important to note that most of the literature is American, which
is expected and logical, but also somewhat problematic due to obvious
biases. One of these is the obsession with China, as it is the focus of
most studies but seems more frightening than in reality. The obsession
with China leaves out analyses of the rise of other great powers,
therefore the literature cannot really establish that the alternative to
unipolarity is multipolarity. The studies that focus on China seem to
implement that the next system will be bipolar. To its credit, though,
it seems that [there is no power]{.underline} that is [emerging as much
as China]{.underline} does, hence it is correct to focus on it. But
then, will other powers be entitled to be regarded as poles? This is an
extra-regional question with significant implications to East Asia in a
global context. The literature regarding the structure of the
international system can be divided into two major types:

A. By the source of threat to the U.S. primacy (future structure): 1.
The China alarmists (bipolarity); 2. The BRICS are emerging
(multipolarity); 3. Who cares? The American advance is too large to
catch up (unipolarity).

B. By the effect on U.S. behavior: 1. Fight to preserve primacy --
preemption or prevention; 2. Get used to it -- selective engagement or
offshore balancing.

Within the Realist paradigm there are two competing theories that
prescribe conflicting advice that is based on contradictory readings of
reality.12 Whereas offensive realism suggests securing material power
that will guarantee a given country\'s security, and securing regional
and global primacy even by force,13 defensive realism suggests
possessing sufficient material power and prefers some sort of power
sharing to enhance mutual trust among the great powers, which enhances
-- they believe -- the security of each power.14 In the American case,
defensive realism suggests offshore balancing or selective engagement,
while offensive realism would prefer domination and engagement with
potential rivals. This does not mean that there cannot be agreement
among all realists concerning American actions, such as the consensus
among many realists that the war against Iraq in 2003 was unnecessary
and even damaging.15 The disagreements grow and are much more acute
regarding other great powers. How should the U.S. treat China and other
emerging or reemerging powers? Should they be engaged? Should the U.S.
prevent the foreseen competition by striking first, or should the U.S.
allow them to emerge as regional hegemons and then divide the world into
spheres of influence with them?

The question everyone asks is whether or not American hegemony is over
or when will it happen. Ian Clark suggests that the term hegemony is
misused, and prefers questioning the future of American primacy.16 This
paper will follow Clark in terminology and substance.

Schweller and Pu say that \"If a great transformation is coming, it is
not one that heralds a radically altered world politics based on
legalism, constitutionalism, or global civic activism. Rather, it is a
structural transformation from unipolarity to multipolarity that most
realists believe promises a return to the familiar history of great
powers struggling for power and prestige.\"17 [There definitely seems to
be [a transition]{.mark}, but is it [to multipolarity]{.mark} or
bipolarity]{.underline}, and in any case -- will it resemble past
experiences? [This [is highly uncertain]{.mark}. The power that the U.S.
had obtained]{.underline} in the last several decades [places it in a
**different category** than any other great power in the foreseeable
future, therefore **[even if the U.S. is less dominant]{.mark}**
compared to other great powers, [it is **far fetching** to argue]{.mark}
for [similar status]{.mark} as in any previous system]{.underline}. This
is not to say that later in the future [such a system]{.underline} might
emerge, but [in the near future it is **unlikely**]{.underline}.18

Robert Art argued in 2010 that the [[U.S. is]{.mark} the [most
powerful]{.mark} state [in]{.mark} the world in [economic and military
assets and will remain]{.mark} the most powerful military power [\"for
some time]{.mark} to come]{.underline},\" but inevitably its edge
relative to other great powers will diminish in the coming decades.
China is the greatest potential rival, provided that its economy will
continue to grow in the coming two decades as it did in the last two
decades (then it will surpass the U.S. in its GDP, but not in its GDP
per capita). For now, [[China]{.mark} had]{.underline} already [[changed
the balance]{.mark} of power]{.underline} in East Asia. It is already
the region\'s dominant military land power. Art assesses that if China
invests in its military forces for several decades, and is determined to
project naval and air power, it will be able to deploy a naval force
that \"could contest the American supremacy at sea in East Asia.\"19
[Some conflict seems inevitable]{.underline}, including arms race, [[but
there can be **more cooperation** than]{.mark} is [assumed]{.mark} by
most scholars]{.underline}.

Art correctly argues that [as long as China\'s]{.underline} emerging
[hegemony]{.underline} in East Asia [does not include Japan and the U.S.
maintains strongholds in]{.underline} the region ([Singapore, the
Philippines and Indonesia), the]{.underline} geopolitical [threat from
China will not be of similar extent as that of the Soviet Union. China
cannot jeopardize the global balance of power]{.underline} as long as
Europe, the Persian Gulf, India, Japan and Russia are independent or
under U.S. influence.20 China cannot threaten the U.S. as the Soviet
Union did due to its relative size. His conclusion: be smart; let China
grow but draw a line in the sand, accept that it is growing but make
sure China knows the U.S. is stronger.

This seems as good advice, but one need only to see China\'s increasing
defense budget to understand why apparently following it is a difficult
job. China had increased the defense budget by 11.2% in 2012, following
two decades of annual two-figure percents increases (since 1989, except
for 2009 -- only 7.5%).21 There are always questions on the purpose of
this steady increase: in preparation for a global conflict with the U.S.
over resources and political interests (i.e., preparing China to become
a rival pole); a regional conflict with any of its neighbors -- and
China indeed has issues with all of them, be it territorial, historical,
economic, etc.; or domestic, preparing to crush separatists or rebels.

In 2001, Mearsheimer wrote that \"American policy \[on China\] has
sought to integrate China into the world economy and facilitate its
rapid economic development, so that it becomes wealthy and, one would
hope, content with its present position in the international system.
This U.S. policy is misguided. A wealthy China would not be a status quo
power but an aggressive state determined to achieve regional
hegemony.... Although it is certainly in China\'s interest to be the
hegemon in Northeast Asia, it is clearly not in America\'s interest to
have that happen.... It is not too late for the United States to reverse
course and do what it can to slow the rise of China.\"22

A decade after Mearsheimer\'s warning, it seems that he was partly
correct and partly wrong. A steadily increasing share of China\'s wealth
is turned into military power, and recently, it is reported, Chinese
strategists apparently began calling their government to fit China\'s
foreign policy to its capabilities, which means replacing the \"peaceful
rise\" and the \"low profile policy\" with a much more ambitious
policy.23 But China\'s economic rise will first need to finance its
aging population. Nevertheless, China\'s goals are unclear to American
and western analysts and policymakers, although there are official
Chinese documents that allow assessing their true aims.24

It is interesting to follow China\'s rise to hegemony in East Asia and
the reaction of its neighbors. They were expected to act to balance
China, but according to Chan\'s study, they don\'t. The defense burden
is not rising and trade with China is increasing -- contrary to the
theoretical expectations.25 This can indicate either that China
succeeded in splitting among its regional rivals, or that the U.S. is no
longer functioning as a regional hegemon, therefore they have no one to
turn to against China.

Michael Beckley provides a detailed analysis of the rise of China and of
the U.S. decline or non-decline.26 Most declinists, as Beckley labels
them, argue that the U.S. is in economic decline, not in military
decline.27 This is an important point -- in military terms the U.S. is
still the sole superpower, and it is hard to see circumstances under
which the U.S. would lose this status. The [American [spending on
defense is still higher than]{.mark}]{.underline} that of
[[all]{.underline}]{.mark} its [potential [rivals combined]{.mark},
and]{.underline} even if the tipping point is coming closer and China
will surpass the U.S. in defense expenditure, [it will take many years
for China to close the gap -- qualitative and quantitative.]{.underline}
Unlike money, [military assets do not vanish]{.underline} (it is hard to
imagine an aircraft carrier simply disappear or being given or sold to
China). Therefore, [[even if]{.underline}]{.mark} the U.S.
[[expenditure]{.underline}]{.mark} on defense [[decreases, it does not
affect]{.underline}]{.mark} American military
[[primacy]{.underline}]{.mark}, at least [in the short run]{.underline}.
Nevertheless, the bond between economy and military affairs is very
strong. For instance, in April 2012 senior U.S. officials admitted that
there is no budget to strike Syria, therefore the solution of the
turmoil would have to be diplomatic.28

Mario Carranza mentions that those who argue that the U.S. **[[hegemony
is not in decline]{.underline}]{.mark}** claim that [neither China nor
Europe can shape events]{.underline} on the basis of their material
power, but he also argues that they underestimate China\'s (and to
lesser extent, Europe\'s) ability to take control over markets in the
Global South (South America and South Asia), and mentions that China
increased dramatically its economic relations with key South American
countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.29

Daniel Drezner presents the economic aspect of China\'s rise, and
focuses on its new status as the U.S.\'s greatest debt holder.30 This
issue is political no less and probably more than economic. But part of
being proof that in the age of globalization that the U.S. promoted so
powerfully it lost the economic primacy (and there are counterarguments
on this), does it make a real difference? After all, had the U.S. lost
any military asset due to its economic decline? Had any such asset been
sold to China? Of course not. Hence, the balance in hard power is quite
clear: China possesses the major part of American dollars in the world
and is America\'s largest creditor and debt holder, but the U.S. had not
lost any of its military power, and it is still superior to any other
power, especially China.

Hart and Jones assert that [the U.S. [economy is]{.mark} still [three
times larger than]{.mark} the [Chinese]{.mark}]{.underline} one.31 But
still, there is change in the degree of influence each power has in the
system. \"China, for instance, has long been a 'sovereignty hawk',
generally opposing the notion that interventions for humanitarian
purposes are legitimate. Its model of authoritarian capitalism has also
increasingly become an ideological export, challenging the United
States' liberal model.\"32 Russia is perhaps misplaced in the list of
emerging powers. Its economic data are not really improving and its
population is declining annually by 4%, and with this rate it might drop
to less than 120 million by 2050 compared to 140 million today.33

This sample of [scholarly literature]{.underline} of the last decade
[demonstrates]{.underline} the [confusion regarding the current
situation]{.underline}, although in recent years it is clearer that
there is a significant decline in American economic primacy. However,
[[it seems **clear to all**]{.mark} that [the U.S.]{.mark} still [holds
**military primacy** and]{.mark}]{.underline} in this aspect primacy
[[does not seem]{.mark} to be [jeopardized for **many years**]{.mark}
**to come**]{.underline}.34

Though on the job for only about dozen weeks, the new administration
handled a lot of action on multiple fronts quite deftly. [At the core of
Trump's view of the world are his views on the global liberal order.
[**Trump** **is no isolationist**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Trump

that [poses no threat to]{.mark} friends and
[allies]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[Copied](http://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/trump-has-foreign-policy-strategy)
For two weeks, the White House has unleashed a foreign-policy
blitzkrieg, and Washington's chattering classes are shocked and, if not
awed, at least perplexed. CNN calls Trump's actions [a
"u-turn."](http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/12/politics/trump-russia-china-nato-syria/)
Bloomberg opts for the more mathematical "180 degree turn," while the
*Washington Post* [goes with
"flipflop."](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-12-27/trump-s-180-degree-turn-on-china-policy)
Meanwhile, pundits switched from decrying the president as an
isolationist [to lambasting
him](https://consortiumnews.com/2017/04/10/neocons-have-trump-on-his-knees/)
as a tool of the neocons. Amid all the relabeling, explanations of [an
"emerging Trump
Doctrine"](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/08/us/politics/trump-doctrine-foreign-policy.html)
have proliferated faster than North Korea's nuclear arsenal. Here's my
take on what's going on: • Yes, [[there is a method to Trump's
"madness.]{.mark}"]{.underline} • No, there has been no big change in
Trump's strategy. [The [actions that flustered
those]{.mark}]{.underline} who thought they had pigeon-holed Donald
Trump [simply [reflect]{.mark} the [impulses **that have driven the
direction**]{.mark} **of this presidency [since before]{.mark} the
[convention]{.mark} in Cleveland**]{.underline}**. At the Center of the
Storm** [Where is the [head]{.mark} and heart [of]{.mark} the
president's national-[security team]{.mark}?]{.underline} Ask that
question a year ago, and the answer would have been simple: General Mike
Flynn, Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Senator Jeff Sessions. Today, Flynn is
gone. Giuliani never went in. Sessions is still a crucial voice in the
administration, but his duties as Attorney General deal only partially
with foreign policy and national-security matters. The new team centers
round Jim [[Mattis at]{.mark} the [Defense]{.mark}
Department]{.underline}, Rex [[Tillerson]{.underline}]{.mark} at the
State Department, John [[Kelly]{.underline}]{.mark} at the Department of
Homeland Security [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} H. R. [[McMaster]{.mark} in
the West Wing---ably assisted by Nikki Haley at the United
Nations.]{.underline} Trump barely knew these people before the
election. [**[There is little question]{.mark}** that the new
**[team's]{.mark}**]{.underline} character and [[**competence**
**affected**]{.mark} the **[White House response]{.mark}** to the recent
string of high profile events]{.underline} and activities---from
presidential meetings with Egypt and China and Tillerson's tête-à-tête
with Putin, to the ominous developments in Syria and North Korea. Though
on the job for only about dozen weeks, [the new administration handled a
lot of [action]{.mark} on multiple fronts quite deftly. Much of that
[can be credited to]{.mark} the **maturity and [experience of
Trump's]{.mark} senior national-security [team]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
But how the administration responded was purely Trumpian---reflecting an
impulse that transcends the makeup of his foreign team or other White
House advisors. **Decoding Trumpian Strategy** Since the early days of
the campaign, one thing has been clear: trying stitch together an
understanding of Trump's foreign and defense policy based on Trump's
tweets and other off-hand comments is a fool's errand. [That has not
changed](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/dont-fear-trumps-tweets-19398)
since the Donald took over the Oval Office. That is not to say that none
of Trump's rhetoric matters. He has given some serious speeches and
commentary. But pundits err when they give every presidential utterance
equal merit. [A joint address to
Congress](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/trump-will-make-good-his-promise-keep-the-country-free-safe-19634)
ought to carry a lot more weight than a 3 a.m. tweet about the
Terminator. But especially with this presidency, [one needs to **[focus
on]{.mark}** White House [**actions rather than words** to]{.mark} gain
a clearer [understandi]{.mark}ng of [where]{.mark} security and [foreign
policy is headed. Do that, and one sees emerging]{.mark} a foreign and
defense [policy]{.mark} **more conventional and [more
consistent]{.mark}**]{.underline} than what we got from Bush or Obama.
Still, a deeper dive is necessary to get at the root of Trump's take on
the world [and how it fits with recent
actions](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-most-shocking-thing-about-trump-so-far-how-boring-hes-19769)
like the tomahawk strikes in Syria and the armada steaming toward North
Korea. **[[I]{.mark} [briefed]{.mark}]{.underline}** Candidate
**[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** and his policy advisors
**[[during]{.mark} the [campaign]{.mark}]{.underline}**. I organized
workshops for the ambassadorial corps during the Cleveland Convention
and worked with the presidential team through the inauguration. Those
experiences let me observe how the policies from the future fledgling
administration were unfolding. Here are some observations that might be
helpful in understanding the Trumpian way. **[At the core of Trump's
view of the world are his views on the global liberal
order]{.underline}**. Trump is no isolationist. **[[He
recognizes]{.mark} that [America]{.mark} is a global power with global
interests and that it [can't]{.mark} promote and [protect]{.mark} those
[interests by sitting at home]{.mark} on its hands]{.underline}**.
Freedom of the commons, engaging and cooperating with like-minded
nations, [[working to blunt problems "over there" before they
get]{.mark} over [here]{.mark}---these are things every modern president
has pursued. **Trump is no different.**]{.underline} What distinguishes
Trump---and what marks a particularly sharp departure from Obama---is
his perception of what enabled post--World War America and the rest of
the free world to rise above the chaos of a half century of global
depression and open war. Obama and his ilk chalked it all up to
international infrastructure---the UN, IMF, World Bank, EU, et al. For
Trump, it was the sovereign states rather than the global bureaucracies
that made things better. The international superstructure has to stand
on a firm foundation---and the foundation is the sovereign state.
Without strong, vibrant, free and wealthy states, the whole thing
collapses like a Ponzi scheme. Trump is an arch nationalist in the
positive sense of the term. [America will never be
safe](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-fight-over-nationalism-about-get-messy-19266)
in the world if the world doesn't have an America that is free, safe and
prosperous. That belief is at the heart of Trump's policies designed to
spark an economic revival, rollback the administrative state and rebuild
the military. It lies at the core of his mantra: make America great
again. Even the strongest [America]{.underline}, however, [can't be a
global power without the willingness to act globally. And **[that\'s
where Trump\'s]{.mark} declaration of "[America First" comes
in]{.mark}.** What it means for foreign policy is that the president
will put the vital interests of the United States above the maintenance
of global institutions]{.underline}. That is **[[not an
abandonment]{.mark} of universal values]{.underline}**. Every American
president deals with the challenge of protecting interests and promoting
values. [Trump]{.underline} will focus on American interests and
American values, and that [poses no threat to friends and
allies]{.underline}. In many cases[, we share the same
values.]{.underline} In many cases, what\'s in [America\'s vital
interest is also in their interest---and best achieved through joint
partnership]{.underline}. Here is how those animating ideas are
currently manifesting themselves in Trump\'s strategy: A strategy
includes ends (what you are trying to accomplish), means (the
capabilities you will use to do that) and ways (how you are going to do
it). [The ends of Trump's strategy are **pretty clear**]{.underline}. In
both talk and action in the Trump world, it boils down to three parts of
the world: Europe, Asia and the Middle East. That makes sense. [Peace
and stability in these regions are vital to U.S. interest]{.underline}s
and are under assault. The United States wants all three parts of the
world to settle. It is unrealistic to think all the problems can be made
to disappear, but it is not unrealistic to significantly reduce the
potential for region-wide conflict.

[[The liberal]{.mark} world [order is **under
assault**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Polls suggest an American ambivalence
about upholding the rules-based global system. Populists are besieging
governing elites in the West while Russia works strategically to
destabilize European and American governments through propaganda and
proxies. [[A rising China wants to create a global system that is not
U.S.-centric]{.underline}]{.mark}, one [in which]{.underline} [smaller
powers defer to bigger ones]{.underline} and norms of democracy and rule
of law do not prevail. Meanwhile, the U.S. alliance system looks adrift
while competitors in China and Russia appear to be on the march. If it
holds, [[this trend could produce a **spheres-of-influence
world**]{.underline} --- [which]{.underline}]{.mark} many, including the
current presidents of the United States, [China]{.underline}, [and
Russia]{.underline}, [find **intuitively attractive**]{.underline}. But
were such an order to replace one based on global integration and
American leadership in the geopolitical cockpits of Europe and Asia, [it
[would]{.mark} only [engender **insecurity** and
**conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [In]{.underline}]{.mark} [a
[spheres]{.mark}-of-influence world]{.underline}, [[great powers order
their regions]{.underline}]{.mark}. The United States would go back to a
"Monroe Doctrine" version of grand strategy; [[Russia]{.mark} would
dominate]{.underline} the [former Soviet space]{.underline};
[[China]{.mark} would govern East Asia]{.underline}, [and [India]{.mark}
South Asia]{.underline}. The problem with this kind of order, however,
is several-fold. Too many [**[spheres overlap]{.underline}** [in ways
that would **generate conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark} [rather than clean
lines of responsibility]{.underline}. [[Japan would oppose Chinese
suzerainty]{.mark} in East Asia, including [by **developing nuclear
weapons**]{.mark}]{.underline}; [[India and China would **compete
vigorously**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in Southeast Asia]{.underline};
[[Russia and China would **contest**]{.mark} **the [resources]{.mark}**
and loyalties of Central Asia]{.underline}; [[Europe and Russia would
clash]{.mark} over primacy of Central and Eastern Europe]{.underline}.
[[The Middle East would be an]{.mark} even more likely [arena for **hot
war** between Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [and Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and
Turkey would contest regions]{.underline} also [claimed by
Russia]{.underline}, [Europe]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} possibly
[China]{.underline}. [Russia]{.underline}, like the Soviet Empire before
it, [would keep pushing west until it met enough hard power to stop
it]{.underline}. [[A spheres]{.mark} of influence
[world]{.mark}]{.underline} [[would]{.underline}]{.mark} also
**[[sharpen great power competition]{.underline}]{.mark}** [outside of
each region]{.underline}. [[Regional hegemony is a **springboard** for
global contestation]{.underline}. [China would be more likely to
challenge the U]{.underline}]{.mark}[nited [S]{.mark}tates out-of-area
if it had subdued **strategic competition**]{.underline} in its own
region. [Russia]{.underline}, like the Soviet Empire before it, [would
keep pushing west until it met enough hard power to stop
it]{.underline}. (The fact that Russian troops marched through Paris
during the Napoleonic Wars demonstrates that the limits of Russian power
need not be confined to the former Warsaw Pact). American leaders have
long understood that a "Fortress America" approach is a source of
national insecurity. Franklin Roosevelt made this case in a series of
"fireside chats" in the run-up to America's participation in World War
II --- even before the advent of the far more sophisticated
power-projection technologies that exist today. Roosevelt and his
generals well understood that the United States could not be safe if
hostile powers controlled Europe and Asia, despite the wide oceans
separating North America from both theaters. [A
[spheres]{.underline}]{.mark}[-of-influence [world
would]{.mark}]{.underline} also [**[crack up]{.underline}** [the
integrated]{.underline}]{.mark} [global [economy]{.mark}]{.underline}
that underlies the miracle in human welfare that has lifted billions out
of poverty in past decades. [[It would replicate]{.mark} the
**[exclusive economic blocs]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of the
1930s]{.underline}, [including an East Asia]{.underline} "co-prosperity
sphere," [[seeding conflict]{.mark} and undercutting
prosperity]{.underline}. A real-world and real-time example of what
happens when American power retreats in an effort to encourage regional
powers to solve their own problems is the mess in Syria. It has produced
the greatest refugee crisis since 1945 --- a stain on the consciousness
of human civilization --- and has led many to conclude that the Middle
Eastern order of states dating to the end of World War 1 is collapsing.
President Obama pursued an express policy of retracting American
military power from the Middle East, including withdrawing all troops
from Iraq and refusing to intervene militarily when President Assad used
chemical weapons against his own people, despite a red-line injunction
from the United States not to do so. Obama and his White House political
advisors believed that American withdrawal from the Arab Middle East (if
not from the ironclad U.S. commitment to Israel) would lead a new
balance of power to form, one policed by regional powers rather than by
America. [This flawed]{.underline}, amoral, and [un-strategic approach
has led to a series of **hot wars **]{.underline}--- in
[Syria]{.underline}, [Iraq]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
[Yemen]{.underline} --- the [collapse of Arab allies' confidence in the
United States as an ally]{.underline}, [as well as]{.underline} an
[**intensified cold war** with Iran]{.underline}. [Despite the
international agreement]{.underline} freezing Iran's nuclear program,
[Iran's support for terrorism and hostile insurgencies targeting
American allies across its region actually **intensified** during this
period]{.underline}. A [[spheres]{.mark}-of-influence]{.underline} world
[[leaves weaker states to become the victims of
stronger]{.underline}]{.mark} or more [aggressive
[ones]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [[it seeds **insecurity**
by]{.underline} [removing]{.underline}]{.mark} [the reassuring variable
of [American military guarantees]{.mark} and presence]{.underline} This
experience underlines a core problem with a
[spheres-of-influence]{.underline} world. It leaves weaker states to
become the victims of stronger or more aggressive ones, and it seeds
insecurity by removing the reassuring variable of American military
guarantees and presence. [It **emboldens American adversaries** and
leads American allies to take self-help measures that themselves may
**undercut** American security interests]{.underline}. A
[[spheres]{.mark}-of-influence world]{.underline} would also [[produce
contestation of the]{.mark} open [global commons]{.mark}]{.underline}
[that are the basis for the **unprecedented prosperity**]{.underline}
produced by the liberal international economic order. [Should
[the]{.mark} Indian and Pacific [Oceans]{.mark}]{.underline}, or the
[Arctic and Mediterranean Seas]{.underline}, [[become arenas of
great-power conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} (like the South China Sea
already has thanks to China's militarization and unilateral assertion of
sovereignty over it) [as leading states seek to incorporate them into
their privileged zones of control]{.underline}, [[economic globalization
would **collapse**]{.mark}, harming the economies of every major
power.]{.underline} [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline},
because of its sheer power and resource base as well as its relative
geographical isolation, [[might do OK]{.underline}]{.mark} in a
spheres-of-influence world. Most of [[America's]{.mark} friends and
[allies would not]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Their
weakening]{.underline}]{.mark} [and insecurity [would]{.mark} in turn
[render the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates weaker and more

**force-multipliers**]{.underline} [for American hard and soft
power]{.underline}]{.mark}, and since norms like [freedom of the global
commons]{.underline} [are]{.underline} in fact [underwritten by that
power]{.underline}. More broadly, [such [a

[[lead to]{.mark} the kind of [**hot wars** that **reorder the

[including]{.underline} by **[incentivizing aggressive states to push
out and assert regional dominion]{.underline}**, [knowing that America

Ultimately, however, we concluded that [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[has a strong interest in
**precluding**]{.mark} **the emergence of [another bipolar
world]{.mark}**]{.underline}---as in the Cold War---[[or]{.mark} a world
of **[many]{.mark} great [powers]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as existed
before the two world wars. [[Multipolarity led to]{.mark} two [world
wars]{.mark} and [bipolarity resulted in]{.mark} a]{.underline}
protracted [worldwide struggle with the [**risk of nuclear
annihilation**. To avoid a return]{.mark} such
circumstances]{.underline}, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney ultimately
agreed that [[our objective must be to prevent a hostile power to
dominate a "critical region]{.mark}," which would]{.underline} give it
the resources, industrial capabilities and population to **[pose a
global challenge]{.underline}**. This insight has guided U.S. defense
policy throughout the post--Cold War era.

[[Giving major powers the green light]{.mark} to establish spheres of
influence [would produce a multipolar world and
**risk**]{.mark}]{.underline} the return of **[[war between]{.mark} the
[major powers]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Without a stabilizing U.S.
presence in the Persian Gulf and U.S. relationships with Jordan and the
Gulf States, Iran could shut down oil shipments in its supposed sphere
of influence. A similar scenario in fact played out during the 1987
"tanker war" of the Iran-Iraq war, which eventually escalated into a
direct military conflict between the United States and Iran. Iran's
nuclear program makes these scenarios even more dangerous.

[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[can
manage the rise]{.mark} and resurgence [of great powers like **China,
Russia and Iran**]{.mark} at an acceptable cost [without ceding]{.mark}
entire [spheres of influence]{.mark}]{.underline}. The key is to focus
on normalizing the geopolitics of the Middle East, Europe and the
Asia-Pacific, which the United States can do by strengthening its
transatlantic and transpacific alliances and adapting them to the new,
dangerous circumstances on the horizon. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [should promote a balance of power in key regions

#### Fettweis is wrong

**Fempa 11** -- Francis P. Sempa, Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Middle
District of Pennsylvania, Adjunct Professor of Political Science at
Wilkes University, and Contributing Editor to American Diplomacy,
October, Review of Dangerous Times? The International Politics of Great
Power Peace By Christopher J. Fettweis, Joint Force Quarterly, Issue 63,
p. 150

Forget Clausewitz, Sun Tzu, and Machiavelli. Put aside Mackinder, Mahan,
and Spykman. Close the military academies and war colleges. Shut our
overseas bases. [Bring our troops home. Make dramatic cuts in the
defense budget. The end of major war]{.underline}, and perhaps the end
of war itself, [is near, according to]{.underline} Tulane assistant
professor Christopher [Fettweis]{.underline} in his recent book,
Dangerous Times? The International Politics of Great Power Peace.

Fettweis is not the first intellectual, nor will he be the last, to
proclaim the onset of perpetual peace. He is squarely in the tradition
of Immanuel Kant, Herbert Spencer, and Norman Angell, to name just
three. Indeed, in the book's introduction, Fettweis attempts to
rehabilitate Angell's reputation for prophecy, which suffered a
devastating blow when the Great War falsified his claim in The Great
Illusion that economic interdependence had rendered great power war
obsolete. Angell, Fettweis writes, was the first "prominent
constructivist thinker of the twentieth century," and was not
wrong---just ahead of his time (p. 5).

Fettweis bases his theory or vision of the obsolescence of major war on
the supposed linear progress of human nature, a major tenet of
20th-century liberalism that is rooted in the rationalist theories of
the Enlightenment. "History," according to Fettweis, "seems to be
unfolding as a line extending into the future---a halting, incomplete,
inconsistent line perhaps, one with frequent temporary reversals, but a
line nonetheless." The world is growing "more liberal and more reliant
upon reason, logic, and science" (p. 217).

[We have heard this all before]{.underline}. Human nature can be
perfected. Statesmen and [leaders will be guided by reason]{.underline}
and science. Such thinking influenced the visionaries of the French
Revolution and produced 25 years of war among the great powers of
Europe. Similar ideas influenced President Woodrow Wilson and his
intellectual supporters who endeavored at Versailles to transform the
horrors of World War I into a peace that would make that conflict "the
war to end all wars." What followed were disarmament conferences, an
international agreement to outlaw war, the rise of expansionist powers,
appeasement by the democracies, and the most destructive war in human
history. [Ideas, which Fettweis claims will bring about the
proliferation of peace]{.underline}, [transformed Russia, Germany, and
Japan into expansionist, totalitarian powers]{.underline}. Those same
ideas led to the Gulag, the Holocaust, and the Rape of Nanking. So much
for human progress.

[[Fettweis]{.underline}]{.mark} knows all of this, but [[claims]{.mark}
that since the end of the Cold War]{.underline}, the leaders and peoples
of [the [major powers]{.mark}, except the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [[have accepted]{.mark} the idea [that major war
is unthinkable]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [His proof is]{.underline}]{.mark}
[that there has been [no major war among]{.mark} the great powers [for
20 years]{.mark}]{.underline}[---[a]{.underline}]{.mark} [historical
[period that coincides with the American "unipolar"
moment]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This is very thin empirical evidence upon
which to base a predictive theory of international
relations.]{.underline}

Fettweis criticizes the realist and neorealist schools of thought,
claiming that their adherents focus too narrowly on the past behavior of
states in the international system. In his view, realists place too
great an emphasis on power. Ideas and norms instead of power, he claims,
provide structure to the international system. Classical geopolitical
theorists such as Halford Mackinder, Alfred Thayer Mahan, Nicholas
Spykman, and Colin Gray are dismissed by Fettweis in less than two
pages, despite the fact that their analyses of great power politics and
conflict have long been considered sound and frequently prescient.

[[Realists]{.mark} and classical geopoliticians
[have]{.mark}]{.underline} more than [[2,000 years of]{.mark} empirical
[evidence]{.mark}]{.underline} [to support their theories of how states
and empires behave and how the international system works]{.underline}.
[[Ideas are important, but]{.underline} [power is the governing
force]{.underline}]{.mark} [in international politics]{.underline}, and
geography is the most permanent factor in the analysis of power.

[Fettweis makes much of the fact that]{.underline} the countries of
Western and Central [Europe]{.underline}, which waged war against each
other repeatedly for nearly 400 years, [are at peace]{.underline}, and
claims that there is little likelihood that they will ever again wage
war against each other. Even if the latter assertion turns out to be
true, [that does not mean that the end of major war is in
sight]{.underline}. Throughout history, some peoples and empires that
previously waged war for one reason or another became pacific without
producing worldwide perpetual peace: the Mongols, Saracens, Ottomans,
Dutch, Venetians, and the Spanish Empire come immediately to mind. A
Europe at peace does not translate to an Asia, Africa, and Middle East
at peace.

In a world in which major wars are obsolete, [[Fettweis believes the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[needs
to]{.underline} [adjust its grand strategy]{.underline}]{.mark} [from
vigorous internationalism [to]{.mark} strategic
[restraint]{.mark}]{.underline}. His specific recommendations include
the removal of all U.S. military forces from Europe; an end to our
bilateral security guarantees to Japan and South Korea; an end to our
alliance with Israel; an indifference to the balance of power on the
Eurasian landmass; a law enforcement approach to terrorism; a drastic
cut in military spending; a much smaller Navy; and the abolition of
regional combatant commands.

What [Fettweis is proposing]{.underline} is effectively [an end
to]{.underline} what Walter Russell Mead calls "[[the maritime world
order]{.underline}]{.mark}" that was established by Great Britain and
maintained first by the British Empire and then by the United States.
[It is a world order that [has]{.mark}]{.underline} [[defeated]{.mark}
repeated [challenges by potential hegemonic powers]{.mark}]{.underline}
[and resulted in an unprecedented spread of prosperity and
freedom]{.underline}. [[But]{.underline}]{.mark} [all of [that, we are
assured, is in the past. China poses no threat]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[can]{.mark} safely [withdraw]{.mark} from Eurasia]{.underline}. The
power vacuum will remain unfilled.

[[Fettweis needs]{.mark} a dose of [humility]{.mark}]{.underline}. Sir
Halford Mackinder, the greatest of all geopoliticians, was referring to
visionaries and liberal idealists like Fettweis when he cautioned, "He
would be a sanguine man . . . who would trust the future peace of the
world to a change in the mentality of any nation." Most profoundly,
General Douglas MacArthur, who knew a little bit more about war and
international conflict than Fettweis, reminded the cadets at West Point
in 1962 that "only the dead have seen the end of war."

#### It has no empirical backing

<https://networks.h-net.org/node/28443/discussions/63534/issf-roundtable-pathologies-power-fear-honor-glory-and-hubris-us)>

Fettweis is clear that he is writing to change (or begin to change) the
national conversation in the United States regarding foreign policy.
Thus, [Fettweis\'s target audience is]{.underline} policymakers and [the
general public. This]{.underline} fact [can make the book
frustrating]{.underline} reading for scholars. For example, [[Fettweis
**does not**]{.underline}]{.mark} always [**[back]{.mark} his [claims
with evidence]{.mark}** or citations. More problematic]{.underline},
however, [is Fettweis\'s call for]{.underline} a rational basis for
[policymaking based on]{.underline} the American [national interest.
What does that mean?]{.underline} Scott [Burchill goes so far as to call
the]{.underline} concept of the [national interest devoid of
**substantive content**]{.underline}.\[5\] Thus, [the
concept]{.underline} of the national interest, to say the least, [is
**rarely clear**]{.underline}---and [that means]{.underline} that [the
rational pursuit]{.underline} of the national interest [is at
best]{.underline} a [very difficult]{.underline} endeavor. Moreover,
[there are multiple modes of rationality. A policymaker
who]{.underline}, like most modern presidents, [obsessively monitors
polling]{.underline} as a basis of policymaking [is being
rational]{.underline} \-- [even if it is]{.underline} a
[different]{.underline} rationality than that which Fettweis calls for.
[[Fettweis]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, largely [**leaves aside**
these issues. He never]{.underline} explicitly [explores the
sources]{.underline} or foundations [of rationality other
than]{.underline} to invoke [classical realism. He **[does not
address]{.mark}**]{.underline} the [[substantial **scholarly
literature** wrestling with]{.underline}]{.mark} the concept of [[a
national interest]{.underline}]{.mark}. Going further, the growing
literature on securitization theory problematizes the idea that threats
are objective conditions that can be clearly identified by savvy or wise
policymakers.\[6\] [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} in turn
[[undermines]{.underline}]{.mark} the objectivist ontology that
underlies [[Fettweis\'s thesis]{.underline}]{.mark}. If it is the case
that threats are intersubjective constructions rather than objective
conditions, Fettweis\' argument is robbed of its prescriptive force. To
be sure, Fettweis\'s critique of the flaws in U.S. foreign policy
remains trenchant. But [[the call]{.mark} to rational
assessment]{.underline} of objective foreign threats
[[becomes]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[hollow]{.underline}]{.mark}** one.
In part [these issues arise because of the 'bridging the gap' agenda
within]{.underline} which Fettweis situates [the book]{.underline}. As
the existence of programs like American University\'s International
Policy Summer Institute and the resurgent debate over the
policy-academia gulf attest,\[7\] efforts like Fettweis\'s are both
badly needed and very welcome. But if bridging the gap were easy, there
would be little need to encourage scholars and policymakers to do it.
Fettweis\'s effort demonstrates just how difficult it can be to satisfy
both sides. [[Academics will be frustrated by Fettweis\'s refusal to
engage in]{.underline}]{.mark} explicit theory building or [[empirical
**verification**]{.mark}. Policymakers will]{.underline} no doubt [be
frustrated by Fettweis\'s **amorphous**]{.underline} policy
[**guidance** to be rational]{.underline} and focus on the national
interest.

#### Fettweis makes terrible assumptions

**Beede 11 --** Benjamin R. Beede, Rutgers, The State University of New
JerseyFettweis, Christopher J. 2008. Losing Hurts Twice as Bad: The Four
States to Moving Beyond Iraq. New York, NY

Fettweis' book might easily be dismissed as an intriguing analysis, but
one that has been superseded by the advent of the Obama Administration,
and the changes in direction that the Obama team has advocated and that
it may implement. [[Fettweis made **a number of assumptions**]{.mark}
**that [have]{.mark} now [been invalidated]{.mark}**]{.underline},
moreover, including a continuation of prosperity. Despite its flaws,
however, the book is a provocative contribution to the literature that
criticizes the forcefulness of the U.S. foreign and military policy.
Fettweis states that his objective is to analyze the "likely
consequences of disaster in Iraq" (16), but he really has two purposes.
One is to explain to people in the United States how they can adjust to
the loss of the Iraq war. The second is to persuade readers that the
United States can safely reduce its activity in international affairs.
Although the author's discussion of Iraq must be addressed, this review
emphasizes Fettweis' contention that the United States can safely be
less assertive in world affairs because the world is not as dangerous a
place as often claimed, and his closely related point that the public
needs to develop a more discriminating approach to assessing threats
from abroad, thereby enabling it to hold its government to higher levels
of competency and accountability. Fettweis' book title comes from a
remark by sports figure Sparky Anderson that "losing hurts twice as bad
as winning feels good" (13). He believes that this observation is valid,
and he comes back to those words repeatedly. To support his contention
concerning the significance of Anderson's statement, Fettweis borrows
from the literature of psychology to explain how people experience
losses, ranging from having relatives or friends taken from them by
death to having their favorite sports teams lose games. In competitive
situations, the harmful psychological effects of losing are said to be
intensified significantly when one adversary or opponent was "supposed"
to win because of its strength. The number of instances where large
countries have lost to guerrilla movements demonstrates that perceptions
of the military advantages that the seemingly stronger side enjoys may
well be outweighed by other factors, however (see Arreguin-Toft 2005;
Record 2007). [Fettweis recommends **a rapid withdrawal**]{.underline}
of the U.S. forces from Iraq. He believes that the Iraq war has "been
the worst kind of defeat for the United States: an unnecessary one, in a
war that should never have been fought" (16, emphasis in the original).
Not only was the war a huge error, Iraq is in such bad OCTOBER BOOK
REVIEWS \| 865 shape that the United States cannot do much to assist its
reconstruction. A long-term occupation might eliminate many problems in
Iraq, but he doubts the United States will stay long enough to affect
major changes in that country. Little harm will come from the
withdrawal, despite predictions by many that there would be civil war in
Iraq and a security breakdown in the entire region. Fettweis is not a
specialist in Middle Eastern affairs, and his interest is in the effects
the Iraq war is having and will have on the United States, not so much
in the Iraq situation. Thus, his book is not comparable to studies like
that by O'Leary (2009). [[There are at least two schools of
thought]{.mark} about]{.underline} the [Iraq]{.underline} war, **[[but
Fettweis ignores this division]{.underline}]{.mark}** of opinion. One
school, which includes Fettweis, criticizes the Bush Administration for
having rashly invaded Iraq and for having failed to plan and execute the
operation properly. Fettweis writes that "\[w\]e were led into the Iraq
morass not by evil people lying on behalf of oil companies but by poor
strategists with a shallow, naive understanding of international
politics" (29). Another school of interpretation views the Iraq (and
Afghanistan) commitments simply as steps in a campaign undertaken to
give the United States a lasting hegemony in the world. From the Bush
Administration's perspective, Iraq might even be considered a success.
The executive branch demonstrated once again that it can wage war with
few checks on its actions, and gave the United States a greater presence
in the Middle East. The **[Obama]{.underline}** Administration **[has
altered Bush's course]{.underline}** to some extent, but so far, there
has not been a radical shift. Indeed, there has been and remains the
possibility of a greater commitment in the region, especially into
Pakistan. Iraq and the United States have agreed to the removal of
coalition forces by 2011, but the continued violence in Iraq and the
construction of substantial military bases suggest that a U.S. military
presence might continue past 2011. In February 2009, Secretary of
Defense Gates reiterated the Obama Administration's commitment to 2011,
but in late May 2009, the army chief of staff, George Casey, declared
that his service branch, at least, is planning for U.S. forces to remain
in Iraq for another decade. In any event, there is little prospect for a
full disengagement from southwest Asia any time soon. Given one of the
purposes of his book, it is hardly surprising that Fettweis focuses
almost entirely on Iraq. He ignores Afghanistan, except for repeatedly
citing the Soviet persistence in trying to hold that country as an
example of a great power making the error of invading a small country in
the face of deep nationalism in the latter. He might have been well
advised to view the entire area of southwestern Asia. Ahmed Rashid
(2008) has described the U.S. involvement in the region that has
extended well beyond Iraq and Afghanistan, and that suffers from the
same kinds of misjudgments made in Iraq and Afghanistan, especially an
overreliance on military measures and a reluctance to commit substantial
resources to economic development. [Fettweis uses Iraq to argue **for
a**]{.underline} strategy of **[restraint]{.underline}** based on his
sanguine view that "we \[the United States and, indeed, the entire
world\] are living in a golden age" (31, emphasis in the original), and
that "\[g\]reat power conflict today is all but unthinkable; therefore,
calculations surrounding the dangers posed by a united Eurasia should
change, since the threats it once posed no longer exist" (208). With the
end of the Cold War, the ability of the enemies of the United States to
harm this country is quite limited. Hostile acts can be perpetrated, but
such attacks cannot overthrow the United States (31). This strategy is
hardly new. Years ago, it was summarized in these words, "Instead of
preserving obsolete Cold War alliances and embarking on an expensive and
dangerous campaign for global stability, the United States should view
the collapse of Soviet power as an opportunity to adopt a less
interventionist policy" (Carpenter 1992, 167). [[Despite the optimistic
picture painted]{.mark} by some national security theorists, **[the
world does contain]{.mark} some [dangerous
elements]{.mark}**]{.underline}. David E. [[Sanger]{.underline}]{.mark}
(2009), for example, [[presents **a chilling picture of
nuc**]{.mark}**lear weapon[s in]{.mark} very possibly [unsteady]{.mark}
[hands]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Much is said in the book concerning
national "credibility," that is, the ability of a country to maintain
its prestige and its reputation for decisive action based on its past
performance. Fettweis argues that many governmental leaders, academic
commentators, and journalists have been obsessed with this element of
national power and have wanted the United States to deal with virtually
any political crisis that occurs (161-75). [[Fettweis states
that]{.mark} "\[f\]or some reason, U.S. [policymakers seem to be]{.mark}
especially [prone to overestimate]{.mark} the [threats]{.mark} they
face"]{.underline} (116). [[There is no explanation]{.mark} of **[why
this should be the case]{.mark}**, nor is there any comparison with the
propensity of leaders in other countries to make similar inaccurate
projections.]{.underline} Numerous instances can be cited where
governmental leaders and commentators have argued heatedly for "action"
on the ground that "inaction" will damage the reputation of the United
States. Early in the Carter Administration, for example, National
Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski dedicated himself for some time to
instigating the dispatch of navy task force to the Horn of Africa during
a period of tension between Ethiopia and Somalia. After failing to
persuade the secretaries of state and defense that such action was
necessary, Brzezinski waged a covert effort through the media to bring a
decision in favor of his policy (Gardner 2008, 40-2). Two case histories
cited in the book as examples of a disastrous insistence on maintaining
credibility are the Spanish and British efforts to hold the Netherlands
and the British colonies that became the United States, respectively.
More recent instances that could have been cited are the controversies
in the United States concerning the "loss" of China in the late 1940s
and the establishment of a communist regime in Cuba in the late 1950s.
Sensitivity concerning Cuba led in part to the intervention in the
Dominican Republic in 1965, and other episodes where the United States
committed itself to fighting insurgencies in Latin America. OCTOBER BOOK
REVIEWS \| 867 Concerns about the political impact of the "loss" of
Vietnam played a significant role in decisions to support the Republic
of Vietnam. These episodes are largely omitted, though. Fear is a potent
political weapon, and foreign threats, whether real or imaginary, are
highly useful within the domestic political arena. Claims of a "missile
gap" helped John F. Kennedy win the presidency, for example. The armed
services and the various intelligence agencies are rewarded because of
fears of foreign threats. Although the armed forces may be cautious
about entering a given conflict or making other violent moves, they are
unlikely to stress the peaceful nature of the world if they want to
retain their budgets and their prestige. Another element in strategy
formulation in the United States has been its experience with long-term
threats. White (1997) asserts that the long conflict with the Soviet
Union fundamentally structured the discussion and resolution of public
policy issues in the United States, and greatly strengthened the
presidency at the expense of Congress and the political parties.
Although his book was written before 9/11, his observation that
political activists and the public have become accustomed to protracted
battles with foreign enemies makes it easy to understand why they could
readily accept a "long war" against terrorism. Somewhat along the same
line, Sherry (1995) maintains that this country has been under emergency
conditions from the Great Depression onward, perhaps even before,
permeating the United States with "militarism" in its broadest sense.
Going back even further, some writers have argued that United States'
assertiveness may be traced to the late nineteenth and especially the
early twentieth century. Lears (2009) points critically to Theodore
Roosevelt as a key player in this development, and Ninkovich (1999)
offers a more favorable view of the "crisis internationalism" of Woodrow
Wilson. [[Fettweis]{.underline}]{.mark} touches on this history, but he
[[underestimates the extent to which]{.mark} [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [has been conditioned to **react vigorously**]{.mark} to
a range of foreign policy issues, and overestimates the differences in
foreign and military policy brought about by changes from one
administration to another]{.underline}. Given this conditioning,
changing the mind-sets of both elites and the public may be an extremely
difficult task. [To a degree, Fettweis' arguments resemble those of the
"American empire" theorists]{.underline}, such as Bacevich (2008),
Johnson (2006), and Gardner and Young (2005). [Critics of the "American
empire" believe that the United States produces much of the
unrest]{.underline} and the tension in the world through its unilateral
actions and its emphasis on military power. Fettweis does not go that
far, but [his advocacy of "strategic restraint" is certainly compatible
with such views.]{.underline} He agrees that the United States'
involvements---especially military commitments---abroad may unsettle
conditions in countries as much as they may stabilize them, but his
purpose is primarily to reassure the people of the United States that
less assertive activity by their country will not result in world chaos.
Thus he does not have much to say about the motivations of elite figures
868 \| POLITICS & POLICY / October 2011 who advocate an active foreign
policy. His argument seems to be that the United States is vastly
overextended in its commitments as a result of a number of individual
mistakes stemming from an overconcern with credibility rather than a
flawed strategy. Despite his disclaimers, [Fettweis' words sometimes
resemble the arguments of pre-World War II isolationists]{.underline}.
Indeed, throughout the book, the word "internationalists," which
properly describes those concerned with international cooperation, is
used to refer to those who should be termed "interventionists," whether
their motivations are power political, economic, or humanitarian, or a
mixture of the three. [Fettweis believes that there was little that the
United States could have done to prevent the outbreak of World War II in
Europe,]{.underline} moreover. [On the contrary, **firmer** U.S.
**support** of France and Great Britain might have encouraged those
countries to force Germany to evacuate the newly reoccupied Rhineland
and to render it much more cautious in its later actions.]{.underline}
After he successfully implemented his plan to put troops into the
Rhineland in 1936, Hitler told his confidants that a French demand for a
withdrawal would have been successful owing to Germany's military
weakness. [Fettweis even praises the United States because it "had the
wisdom to remain neutral for more than two years]{.underline}" and thus
"escaped the worst of the suffering" (206). **[This is surely
wrong.]{.underline}** [An earlier involvement in the war would doubtless
have reduced U.S. casualties]{.underline} and other costs because
invasions of Europe would have been unnecessary if the French and
British had held at least part of the continent, and because Germany
might not have developed a cushion of occupied territories to protect it
from land attacks and from air assaults for a time. Whether a public
educated by books like this one would be able to make suitable threat
assessments, and thereby be better able to exercise control over
governmental actions abroad is another question. [Fettweis' work may be
quite persuasive because he expresses his views clearly and avoids
highly charged language.]{.underline} However, if elites agree about
dangers from abroad, then popular opinion may have little effect on
policy making and policy implementation. [[Fettweis' thinking is
**significantly flawed**]{.underline} [by his assumption that "politics
is]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and always will be, [the enemy of]{.mark}
[strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}[,"]{.mark} and reiterates his point (26,
157). Fettweis adds that "it would be naive to suggest that it is
possible to keep politics completely separate from strategy, nor would
it be fully desirable to do so in a democracy" (26-7), but "for the sake
of this book, we will attempt to clarify the national interest by
keeping the two realms separate, to the extent possible" (27).
Determining national strategy is necessarily a highly political act, and
it cannot be established without considering the demands of major
internal stakeholders. What he terms "politics" may often be differing
opinions based on different data or interpretations of the same data.
Political survival is critical for a political leader, and such leaders
can understandably be hesitant in exercising restraint if they believe
their opponents will attack them, perhaps decisively, for being "soft"
on the enemies of the day. Fettweis is fond of the term "realist" to

analysts, but describing someone as a "realist" may simply mean that the
person agrees with the views of the individual applying that
description. In certain instances, "realism" can mean being restrained,
and, in other instances, being highly assertive. [Appropriate policy
decisions are likely to be made on the basis of accurate intelligence
and careful assessments rather than adherence to a general
outlook.]{.underline}

[**[rogue officer]{.underline}** [deciding]{.underline}]{.mark} that [he
or she]{.underline} [wants [to launch]{.mark} a nuclear
weapon]{.underline}. [There is]{.underline} the [risk of **"[loose
nukes]{.mark}"**]{.underline} [falling]{.underline} into the wrong
hands, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [risk]{.underline} that
[individual [scientists]{.mark}]{.underline} will be willing to
**[[transfer]{.mark} nuclear [tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}** to the
highest bidder, [[as]{.mark} Pakistan's A.Q. [Khan
did]{.mark}]{.underline} in selling nuclear technology [to Iran, Libya,
and]{.underline} **[No]{.underline}**rth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea. When
the nuclear bomb was first being developed, Secretary of War Henry
[[Stimson offered a]{.underline}]{.mark} poignant [[warning]{.mark}
about [how]{.mark} devastating]{.underline} the [weapon would
be]{.underline}. He told President Henry Truman that
"[[such]{.underline}]{.mark} a weapon [[may be constructed]{.underline}
**[in secret]{.underline}** [and used]{.underline}
**[suddenly]{.underline}**]{.mark} and effectively [with]{.underline}
**[devastating power]{.underline}** [by a]{.underline} willful nation or
[group against a]{.underline}n unsuspecting [nation]{.underline} or
group of [much greater]{.underline} size and material power." Today,
[[America's]{.underline}]{.mark} "greater [[size]{.mark} and material
power" **[can't]{.mark}**]{.underline} necessarily
[[stop]{.underline}]{.mark} a [**nuclear [strike]{.mark}**,]{.underline}
particularly [[if]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[materials
fall]{.underline}]{.mark} in[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [hands of

#### [Terrorism]{.underline} causes [extinction]{.underline}

And [what standards of **international order** and law would still
hold]{.underline} sway? [[The country attacked might]{.mark} well
**[lash out militarily]{.mark}**]{.underline} at whatever countries it
thought might bear a portion of responsibility. (A terrifying
description of the kinds of discussions that might occur appeared in
Brian Jenkins' book, Will Terrorists Go Nuclear?) [[With the nuclear
threshold]{.mark} already [crossed]{.mark}]{.underline} in this
scenario---at least by terrorists---it [is conceivable that some of the
resulting [conflicts]{.mark} might **[escalate to nuclear
use.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [International politics could
become]{.underline} more **[brutish]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[violent,]{.underline}** [with powerful states taking unilateral
action]{.underline}, [by force]{.underline} if necessary, in an effort
to ensure their security. [After 9/11, the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [led the invasions of
two sovereign nations]{.underline}, in wars that have since cost
hundreds of thousands of lives and trillions of dollars, while plunging
a region into chaos. [Would the reaction after a far more devastating
nuclear attack be any less?]{.underline}

In particular, the idea that each state can decide for itself how much
security to provide for nuclear weapons and their essential ingredients
would likely be seen as totally unacceptable following such an attack.
[Powerful states would likely demand]{.underline} that [others surrender
their nuclear material or accept foreign troops]{.underline} (or other
imposed security measures) to guard it.

[That could well be the first step toward a more **profound
transformation of the international system**]{.underline}. After such a
catastrophe, [[major powers may feel compelled to]{.mark} more freely
[engage in **preventive war**]{.mark}]{.underline}, seizing territories
they worry might otherwise be terrorist safe havens, and taking other
steps they see as brutal but necessary to preserve their security. For
this reason, [foreign policy analyst Stephen Krasner has
argued]{.underline} that ["conventional [rules of sovereignty **would be
abandoned overnight**]{.mark}."]{.underline} [[Confidence
in]{.underline}]{.mark} both the national security institutions of the
country attacked and [[international institutions]{.mark} such
as]{.underline} the [International Atomic Energy Agency and the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[N]{.underline}**ations, which had so
manifestly failed to prevent the devastation, [might
[erode]{.mark}]{.underline}. The effect on nuclear weapons policies is
hard to predict: One can imagine new nuclear terror driving a new push
for nuclear disarmament, but one could also imagine states feeling more
certain than ever before that they needed nuclear weapons.

### New Mod\-\--Terror\-\--A2: No Impact

#### Nuclear terror causes accidental US/Russia nuclear war\-\--extinction

Risks of Inadvertent Nuclear War Between the United States and Russia,"
Science and Global Security 21(2): 106-133)

[[War involving]{.mark} significant fractions of the [U.S. and
Russian]{.mark} nuclear [arsenals,]{.mark}]{.underline} which are by far
[the largest of any nations]{.underline}, [[could have globally
catastrophic effects]{.underline}]{.mark} such as severely reducing food
production for years,1 potentially [[leading to]{.mark} collapse of
modern civilization worldwide and even the **[extinction of
humanity]{.mark}**]{.underline}.2 Nuclear war between the United States
and Russia could occur by various routes, including accidental or
unauthorized launch; deliberate first attack by one nation; and
inadvertent attack. In an accidental or unauthorized launch or
detonation, system safeguards or procedures to maintain control over
nuclear weapons fail in such a way that a nuclear weapon or missile
launches or explodes without direction from leaders. In a deliberate
first attack, the attacking nation decides to attack based on accurate
information about the state of affairs. In an inadvertent attack, the
attacking nation mistakenly concludes that it is under attack and
launches nuclear weapons in what it believes is a counterattack.3
(Brinkmanship strategies incorporate elements of all of the above, in
that they involve intentional manipulation of risks from otherwise
accidental or inadvertent launches.4 ) ¶ Over the years, nuclear
strategy was aimed primarily at minimizing risks of intentional attack
through development of deterrence capabilities, though numerous measures
were also taken to reduce probabilities of accidents, unauthorized
attack, and inadvertent war. For purposes of deterrence, both U.S. and
Soviet/Russian forces have maintained significant capabilities to have
some forces survive a first attack by the other side and to launch a
subsequent counterattack. However, concerns about the extreme
disruptions that a first attack would cause in the other side's forces
and command-and-control capabilities led to both sides' development of
capabilities to detect a first attack and launch a counter-attack before
suffering damage from the first attack.5¶ Many people believe that with
the end of the Cold War and with improved relations between the United
States and Russia, the risk of East-West nuclear war was significantly
reduced.6 However, it has also been argued that [**[inadvertent nuclear
war]{.mark}** between the United States and Russia has
[continue]{.mark}]{.underline}d [[to present]{.mark} a **[substantial
risk]{.mark}**]{.underline}.7 While the United States and Russia are not
actively threatening each other with war, they have remained ready to
launch nuclear missiles in response to indications of attack.8¶ [False
indicators of nuclear attack could be caused in several
ways]{.underline}. First, a wide range of events have already been
mistakenly interpreted as indicators of attack, including weather
phenomena, a faulty computer chip, wild animal activity, and
control-room training tapes loaded at the wrong time.9 Second,
[[terrorist groups]{.mark} or other actors [might cause attacks
on]{.mark} either [the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [or Russia
that resemble]{.mark} some kind of nuclear [attack by the other]{.mark}
nation by actions such as exploding a stolen or improvised nuclear
bomb]{.underline},10 especially if such an event occurs during a crisis
between the United States and Russia.11 [[A variety of]{.mark} nuclear
terrorism [scenarios are possible]{.mark}]{.underline}.12 [[Al Qaeda has
sought]{.mark} to obtain or construct [nuclear weapons]{.mark} and to
use them against the United States]{.underline}.13 [[Other methods could
involve]{.mark} attempts to circumvent nuclear weapon [launch
control]{.mark} safeguards or exploit holes in their
security.]{.underline}14 [It has long been argued that the probability
of inadvertent nuclear war is significantly higher during U.S.-Russian
crisis conditions]{.underline},15 with the Cuban Missile Crisis being a
prime historical example. [It is possible that U.S.-Russian [relations
will]{.mark} significantly **[deteriorate]{.mark}** in the future,
**[increasing nuclear tensions]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [There
are]{.underline}]{.mark} [a variety of [ways for a third party to raise
tensions]{.mark} between the United States and Russia]{.underline},
[[making]{.mark} one or both [nations]{.mark} more likely to
[misinterpret]{.mark} events as [attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}.16

#### Detonation causes [extinction]{.underline}\-\--even [without]{.underline} retaliation

**Toon 7** -- Chair of the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic
Sciences at CU-Boulder, et al. Owen B., April 19, 2007, "Atmospheric
Effects and Societal Consequences of Regional Scale Nuclear Conflicts
and Acts of Individual Nuclear Terrorism," online:
<http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/acp-7-1973-2007.pdf>

To an increasing extent, [people are congregating in the world's great
urban centers, creating megacities with populations exceeding 10 million
individuals]{.underline}. At the same time, [advanced technology has
designed nuclear [explosives of]{.mark} such [small size]{.mark} they
can be easily transported in a car]{.underline}, small plane or boat [to
the heart of a city]{.underline}. We demonstrate here that [a single
detonation in the 15 kiloton range [can produce]{.mark} urban fatalities
approaching one million]{.underline} in some cases, [and [casualties
exceeding one million]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thousands of small weapons
still exist in the arsenals of the U.S. and Russia, and there are at
least six other countries with substantial nuclear weapons inventories.
In all, thirty-three countries control sufficient amounts of highly
enriched uranium or plutonium to assemble nuclear explosives. A conflict
between any of these countries involving 50-100 weapons with yields of
15 kt has the potential to create fatalities rivaling those of the
Second World War. Moreover, [even [a single]{.mark} surface nuclear
[explosion]{.mark}]{.underline}, or an air burst in rainy conditions,
[in a city center [is likely to cause the]{.mark} entire metropolitan
[area to be abandoned]{.mark} at least [for decades]{.mark}]{.underline}
owing to infrastructure damage and radioactive contamination. As the
aftermath of hurricane Katrina in Louisiana suggests, [the [economic
consequences of even a localized nuclear catastrophe would]{.mark} most
likely [have severe]{.mark} national and [international]{.mark} economic
[consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}. Striking effects result even from
relatively small nuclear attacks because low yield detonations are most
effective against city centers where business and social activity as
well as population are concentrated. Rogue nations and [[terrorists
would]{.mark} be most likely to [strike there]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Accordingly, [[an]{.underline}]{.mark} organized [[attack]{.mark} on the
U.S. by a small nuclear state, or terrorists]{.underline} supported by
such a state, [[could generate casualties comparable to]{.mark}
those]{.underline} once [predicted for [a **full-scale nuclear**]{.mark}
**"counterforce" [exchange in a superpower
conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Remarkably, the [estimated quantities
of [smoke generated]{.mark} by attacks totaling about one megaton of
nuclear explosives [could lead to significant global climate
perturbations]{.mark}]{.underline} (Robock et al., 2007). While we did
not extend our casualty and damage predictions to include potential
medical, social or economic impacts following the initial explosions,
such analyses have been performed in the past for large-scale nuclear
war scenarios (Harwell and Hutchinson, 1985). Such a study should be
carried out as well for the present scenarios and physical outcomes.

#### Global nuclear war 

**Ayson 10** (Robert, professor of strategic studies and director of the
Centre for Strategic Studies, "After a Terrorist Nuclear Attack:
Envisaging Catalytic Effects," June 21,
<http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1057610X.2010.483756>)

[A **Catalytic Response**: **Dragging in the Major Nuclear
Powers**]{.underline} A terrorist nuclear attack, and even the use of
nuclear weapons in response by the country attacked in the first place,
would not necessarily represent the worst of the nuclear worlds
imaginable. Indeed, there are reasons to wonder whether [[nuclear
terrorism should]{.underline}]{.mark} ever [[be regarded
as]{.underline}]{.mark} belonging in the category of truly
**[[existential threats]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A contrast can be drawn
here with the global catastrophe that would come from a massive nuclear
exchange between two or more of the sovereign states that possess these
weapons in significant numbers. Even the worst terrorism that the
twenty-first century might bring would fade into insignificance
alongside considerations of what a general nuclear war would have
wrought in the Cold War period. And it must be admitted that as long as
the major nuclear weapons states have hundreds and even thousands of
nuclear weapons at their disposal, there is always the possibility of a
truly awful nuclear exchange taking place precipitated entirely by state
possessors themselves. But these two nuclear worlds---a non-state actor
nuclear attack and a catastrophic interstate nuclear exchange---are not
necessarily separable. It is just possible that some sort of terrorist
attack, and especially an act of [nuclear [terrorism, could precipitate
a **chain of events** leading to a **massive exchange of nuclear
weapons** between]{.mark} two or more of the [states]{.mark} that
possess them]{.underline}. In this context, today\'s and tomorrow\'s
terrorist groups might assume the place allotted during the early Cold
War years to new state possessors of small nuclear arsenals who were
seen as raising the risks of a catalytic nuclear war between the
superpowers started by third parties. These risks were considered in the
late 1950s and early 1960s as concerns grew about nuclear proliferation,
the so-called n+1 problem. It may require a considerable amount of
imagination to depict an especially plausible situation where an act [of
nuclear terrorism could lead to]{.underline} such [a **massive
inter-state nuclear war**]{.underline}. For example, in the event of a
terrorist nuclear attack on the United States, it might well be wondered
just how [[Russia and]{.mark}/or [China could]{.mark}]{.underline}
plausibly [[be brought in]{.mark}to the picture]{.underline}, not least
because they seem unlikely to be fingered as the most obvious state
sponsors or encouragers of terrorist groups. They would seem far too
responsible to be involved in supporting that sort of terrorist behavior
that could just as easily threaten them as well. [Some
possibilities]{.underline}, however remote, do [suggest
themselves]{.underline}. For example, [how might the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [react if
it]{.underline} was [thought]{.underline} or discovered that the
[fissile material]{.underline} used in the act of nuclear terrorism [had
come from Russian stocks]{.underline}, 40 and if for some reason Moscow
denied any responsibility for nuclear laxity? The [**[correct
attribution]{.mark}** of]{.underline} that [nuclear material to
a]{.underline} particular [country [might not be]{.mark} a case of
[science fiction]{.mark}]{.underline} given the observation by Michael
May et al. that while the debris resulting from a nuclear explosion
would be "spread over a wide area in tiny fragments, its radioactivity
makes it detectable, identifiable and collectable, and a wealth of
information can be obtained from its analysis: the efficiency of the
explosion, the materials used and, most important ... some indication of
where the nuclear material came from." 41 [[**Alternatively**,
if]{.underline}]{.mark} the act of [nuclear [terrorism came as
a]{.mark}]{.underline} complete [[surprise]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
American officials refused to believe that a terrorist group was fully
responsible (or responsible at all) [[suspicion would shift]{.mark}
immediately [to state possessors]{.mark}]{.underline}. Ruling out
Western ally countries like the United Kingdom and France, and probably
Israel and India as well, authorities in Washington would be left with a
very short list consisting of North Korea, perhaps Iran if its program
continues, and possibly Pakistan. But at what stage would Russia and
China be definitely ruled out in this high stakes game of nuclear
Cluedo? In particular, if the act of nuclear terrorism occurred against
a backdrop of existing tension in Washington\'s relations with Russia
and/or China, and at a time when threats had already been traded between
these major powers, would officials and political leaders not be tempted
to assume the worst? Of course, the chances of this occurring would only
seem to increase if the United States was already involved in some sort
of limited armed conflict with Russia and/or China, or if they were
confronting each other from a distance in a proxy war, as unlikely as
these developments may seem at the present time. The reverse might well
apply too: should a nuclear terrorist attack occur in Russia or China
during a period of heightened tension or even limited conflict with the
United States, could Moscow and Beijing resist the pressures that might
rise domestically to consider the United States as a possible
perpetrator or encourager of the attack?
[[Washington\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} early
[[response]{.underline}]{.mark} to a terrorist nuclear attack on its own
soil [[might]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[raise the possibility of
a]{.underline}]{.mark}n unwanted (and [**[nuclear]{.mark} aided)
[confrontation with Russia and]{.mark}/or [China]{.mark}**. For example,
[in]{.mark} the]{.underline} noise and [[confusion]{.underline}]{.mark}
during the immediate aftermath of the terrorist nuclear attack, [the
[U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} president [[might]{.underline}]{.mark} be
expected to [[place the]{.underline}]{.mark} country\'s armed forces,
including its [nuclear [arsenal, on]{.mark}]{.underline} a
[[higher]{.underline}]{.mark} stage of [[alert]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
such a tense environment, when careful planning runs up against the
friction of reality, it is just possible that [[Moscow and]{.mark}/or
[China might]{.mark} mistakenly [read this as a sign of U.S.
intentions]{.mark} to use]{.underline} force (and possibly [nuclear
force) against them]{.underline}. In that situation, the [[temptations
to **preempt**]{.underline}]{.mark} such actions [[might
grow]{.underline}]{.mark}, although it must be admitted that [any
preemption would]{.underline} probably still [meet with a devastating
response]{.underline}.

### New Mod\-\--Terror\-\--A2: No Terror\-\--Means

#### The risk has never been higher -- a single-attack kills millions and escalates global conflict -- goes nuclear 

**Arguello 18** (Irma, founder and chair of the NPSGlobal Foundation,
and head of the secretariat of the Latin American and Caribbean
Leadership Network, degree in physics, a Master's in business
administration, and completed graduate studies in defense and security,
"The global impacts of a terrorist nuclear attack: What would happen?
What should we do?," Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, 2-21,
<https://doi.org/10.1080/00963402.2018.1436812>)

Though hard to accept, [the detonation of a nuclear device --
by]{.underline} states or [non-state actors -- is today a plausible
scenario.]{.underline} And while much of the world's focus has been on
the current nuclear weapons arsenals possessed by states -- about 14,550
warheads, all of which carry the risk of intentional or unintentional
use -- [[the threat of nuclear terrorism is **here** and
**increasing**]{.underline}.]{.mark} [For more than a decade, [Al Qaeda,
Aum Shinrikyo, and other terrorist groups have expressed]{.mark} their
[desire]{.mark} to acquire fissile material [to build and
detonate]{.mark} an improvised nuclear bomb.]{.underline} None of them
could fulfill that goal -- so far. But that does not mean that they will
not succeed in the future. Making matters worse, [[there is evidence of
an illicit market for]{.mark} nuclear weapons-usable
[materials]{.mark}]{.underline}. [There are [sellers in search
of]{.mark} potential [buyers, as shown by]{.mark} the dismantlement of a
nuclear smuggling network in [Moldova]{.mark} in 2015]{.underline}.
[There]{.underline} certainly [are plenty of sites from which to obtain
nuclear material]{.underline}. According to the 2016 Nuclear Security
Index by the Nuclear Threat Initiative, [[**24 countries** still
host]{.mark} inventories of [nuclear]{.mark} weapons-usable
[materials]{.mark}]{.underline}, stored in facilities with different
degrees of security. And in terms of risk, it is not necessary for a
given country to possess nuclear weapons, weapons-usable materials, or
nuclear facilities for it to be useful to nuclear terrorists:
[Structural and institutional weaknesses in a country may make it
favorable for the illicit trade of materials]{.underline}. Permeable
boundaries, high levels of corruption, weaknesses in judicial systems,
and consequent impunity may give rise to a series of transactions and
other events, which could end in a nuclear attack. The truth is that, at
[this stage, no country in possession of nuclear weapons or
weapons-usable materials can guarantee their full protection against
nuclear terrorism or nuclear smuggling.]{.underline} Because we live in
a world of growing insecurity, where explicit and tacit agreements
between the relevant powers -- which upheld global stability during the
post- Cold War -- are giving way to increasing mistrust and hostility, a
question arises: How would our lives be affected if a current terrorist
group such as the Islamic State (ISIS), or new terrorist groups in the
future, succeed in evolving from today's Manchester style "low-tech"
attacks to a "high-tech" one, involving a nuclear bomb, detonated in a
capital city, anywhere in the world? We attempted to answer this
question in a report developed by a high-level multidisciplinary expert
group convened by the NPSGlobal Foundation for the Latin American and
Caribbean Leadership Network. We found that there would be multiple
harmful effects that would spread promptly around the globe (Arguello
and Buis 2016); a more detailed analysis is below, which highlights the
need for the creation of a comprehensive nuclear security system. The
consequences of a terrorist nuclear attack [[A **small** and
**primitive**]{.mark} 1-kiloton fission [bomb]{.mark}]{.underline} (with
a yield of about one-fifteenth of the one dropped on Hiroshima, and
certainly much less sophisticated; cf. Figure 1), [detonated in any
large capital city of the developed world, [would cause an
**unprecedented catastrophic scenario**]{.mark}. An estimate of direct
effects]{.underline} in the attack's location [includes [a death toll
of]{.mark}]{.underline} 7,300-to-[[23,000]{.underline}]{.mark} people
and 12,600-to-57,000 people injured, depending on the target's geography
and population density. Total physical destruction of the city's
infrastructure, due to the blast (shock wave) and thermal radiation,
would cover a radius of about 500 meters from the point of detonation
(also known as ground zero), while ionizing radiation greater than 5
Sieverts -- compatible with the deadly acute radiation syndrome -- would
expand within an 850-meter radius. From the environmental point of view,
such an area would be unusable for years. In addition, radioactive
fallout would expand in an area of about 300 square kilometers,
depending on meteorological conditions (cf. Figure 2). But the
consequences would go far beyond the effects in the target country,
however, and promptly propagate worldwide. [Global and national
security]{.underline}, economy and finance, [international governance
and its framework, national political systems, and the behavior of
governments and individuals would all be put under **severe
trial.**]{.underline} The severity of the effects at a national level,
however, would depend on the countries' level of development,
geopolitical location, and resilience. [[Global security]{.mark} and
regional/national defense schemes [would be strongly
affected]{.mark}]{.underline}. [An increase in [**global distrust**
would spark **rising tensions**]{.mark} among countries and blocs, [that
could even lead to]{.mark}]{.underline} the brink of **[[nuclear]{.mark}
weapons [use]{.mark}]{.underline}** by states (if, for instance, a
sponsor country is identified). [[The consequences]{.mark} of such a
shocking scenario [would include]{.mark} a decrease in states'
self-control, an [**escalation of present conflicts** and]{.mark} the
emergence of **[new ones]{.mark}**, accompanied by an increase in
military unilateralism and military expenditures.]{.underline} Regarding
the economic and financial impacts, a [severe global economic depression
would rise from the attack]{.underline}, likely [lasting for years.
Its]{.underline} duration would be strongly dependent on the course of
the crisis. [The main results of such a crisis would include a 2 percent
fall of growth in global]{.underline} **[G]{.underline}**ross
**[D]{.underline}**omestic **[P]{.underline}**roduct, and a 4 percent
decline of international trade in the two years following the attack
(cf. Figure 3). In the case of developing and less-developed countries,
[the [economic impacts would]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[include a
shortage of]{.mark} high-tech]{.underline}nology [products such as
[medicines]{.mark}, as well as a]{.underline} fall in foreign direct
investment and a [severe decline of international [humanitarian
aid]{.mark} toward low-income countries.]{.underline} We expect an
increase of unemployment and poverty in all countries. **[[Global
poverty would raise about 4 percent]{.mark}]{.underline}** after the
attack, which implies that at least **[[30 million more]{.mark} people
would be [living in extreme poverty]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in addition
to the current estimated 767 million. In the area of international
relations, we would [expect a breakdown of key doctrines involving
politics, security, and relations among states]{.underline}. [[These
international tensions could lead to a **collapse of the nuclear
order**]{.mark}]{.underline} as we know it today, [[with]{.mark} a
consequent [setback of]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}nuclear disarmament
and **[[nonprolif]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration
[commitments]{.underline}. In other words, the whole system based on the
Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty would be put under severe trial. After
the attack, there would be a reassessment of existing security
doctrines, and a deep review of concepts such as nuclear deterrence,
no-first use, proportionality, and negative security assurances.
Finally, the behavior of governments and individuals would also change
radically. [Internal chaos]{.underline} fueled by the media and social
networks [would threaten governance at all levels]{.underline}, with
greater impact on those countries with weak institutional frameworks.
[Social [turbulence would emerge]{.mark} in most countries, with
[consequent attempts by governments to impose restrictions on personal
freedoms]{.mark} to preserve order]{.underline} -- possibly [by
declaring a state of]{.underline} siege or state of
[emergency]{.underline} -- and legislation would surely become tougher
on human rights. [There would]{.underline} also [be a significant
increase in social fragmentation]{.underline} -- with a deepening of
antagonistic views, mistrust, and intolerance, both within countries and
towards others -- and a resurgence of large-scale social movements
fostered by ideological interests and easily mobilized through social
media.

#### Threat is high. Nuclear terrorists have multiple means of acquisition and will detonate in the U.S.

**Wilson 10** (Valeria Plame, Fellow -- Santa Fe Institute and Former
Covert CIA Operative Specializing in Nuclear Terrorism, "Nuclear
Terrorism Is Most Urgent Threat", CNN, 4-8,
http://www.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/04/08/plame.wilson.nuclear.danger/index.html)

But I did not lose my belief that [the danger of [nuclear
terror]{.mark}ism [was the **most urgent threat**]{.mark} we
face]{.underline}. Nor did I lose my passion for working, albeit in a
new way, to address that threat. I am working on this issue now as part
of the international Global Zero movement, in which political, military
and faith leaders, experts and activists strive for the worldwide
elimination of all nuclear weapons.

We know that [terrorist [groups have been trying]{.mark} to buy, build
or steal a bomb]{.underline}.

[In the past two decades, [there have been]{.mark}]{.underline} at least
[25 [instances of]{.mark} nuclear]{.underline} explosive
[[materials]{.mark} being [lost or stolen]{.mark}. There is
[enough]{.mark}]{.underline} highly enriched uranium, or HEU, in the
world today [[to build]{.underline}]{.mark} more than [[100,000
bombs]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Terrorists]{.underline}]{.mark} looking to buy or steal HEU [[could
look to]{.underline}]{.mark} the approximately [[40 countries]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} nuclear]{.underline} weapons [[materials.
And]{.underline}]{.mark} then there are [[rogue]{.mark}
[individuals]{.mark}]{.underline} out there who [are running black
markets]{.underline} selling nuclear materials and technology.

Pakistan\'s Dr. [A. Q. Khan did it for years]{.underline} before my
group at the CIA brought him down in December 2003 after catching him
red-handed selling a full-scale nuclear bomb to Moammar Gadhafi\'s
regime in Libya.

If [[terrorists]{.underline}]{.mark} manage to get their hands on enough
HEU, they [[could smuggle]{.mark} it into a]{.underline} target [city,
build a bomb [and explode it]{.mark}]{.underline}. A hundred pounds of

There are two major dimensions of the nuclear terrorist threat: the
"supply" side of nuclear proliferation and the "demand" side of violent
Islamist extremism. Over the past decade, longstanding
[[concerns]{.mark} over proliferation [have become increasingly
acute]{.mark} in light of]{.underline} a number of worrisome
developments, including the status of **[[India]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and **[[Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark}** as overt nuclear weapon states,
**[[North Korea]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s two nuclear weapons tests, the
international community's failure to restrain Iran's nuclear ambitions,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the fear that an
**[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}**ian nuclear weapons program could spark
further proliferation throughout the Middle East. Ultimately, while
existing nuclear arsenals and stockpiles of fissile material represent
the most immediate concern, [the [spread]{.mark} of nuclear weapons and
[material]{.mark} has increased the probability that [terrorists]{.mark}
might]{.underline} be able to [[acquire]{.mark} or construct a nuclear
device]{.underline}. At the same time that nuclear proliferation has
become a growing concern, [[terrorism has]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[been [elevated]{.mark}]{.underline} from a secondary [[to a primary
threat]{.underline}]{.mark} to US security [because of the emergence of
groups that have few inhibitions on inflicting mass casualties by means
of]{.underline} chemical, biological, and even [nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. Today, for example, the threat of nuclear

International community is aware of the [[terrorists\'
intent]{.mark}ions [to acquire nuclear material]{.mark}. We
are]{.underline} thus [living with the]{.underline} modern day
[nightmare]{.underline} of the [possibility of nuclear
terrorism]{.underline}. Among [[non- state actors]{.underline}]{.mark}
Al Qaeda is considered to be the most aspirant organization which [has
used resources and [made]{.mark}]{.underline} foiled
[[attempts]{.mark}]{.underline} to acquire nuclear weapon/material and
use it. Analysts fears that [hostile states]{.underline} namely [[Iran
and North Korea would provide]{.underline}]{.mark} nuclear [[material to
terrorists]{.underline}]{.mark} to use it against their enemies. Despite
the fact international community realized the threat of nuclear
terrorism in 1990s, [[IAEA has registered 800
cases]{.underline}]{.mark}, since end of the Cold War to 2010,
[[where]{.mark}in [radioactive material was]{.mark}]{.underline} either
[missing or]{.underline} it was [[taken]{.mark} into possession [by
smugglers]{.mark}.]{.underline} As all roads of terrorist activities are
linked with Pakistan, this country can face serious problems if
terrorists succeeds in their attempts. [[Several]{.mark} terrorist
[organizations]{.mark}]{.underline} and non- state actors across the
globe have [e[xpressed]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[resolve to
acquire]{.underline}]{.mark} Chemical, Biological, Radiological and
Nuclear ([[CBRN]{.mark}) material]{.underline}. Among these terrorists
organizations Al Qaeda has made multiple attempts and expressed its
determination to obtain nuclear material. Prosecution witness Jamal
Ahmad Al Fadl quit Al Qaeda in 1996 and assisted Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Fadl while
recording his statement in court claimed that in late 1993 or early 1994
Al Qaeda made an attempt to acquire uranium worth \$ 1.5 million. Amount
was paid to former Sudanese president Saleh Mobruk. In post 9/11 era
many feared that terrorists would acquire WMD and use it against their
enemies and enemy allies. In 1998 Al Qaeda Chief Osama bin Laden
declared, \"it is his duty to obtain WMD.\"Al Qaeda senior leadership in
pre 9/11 era pursued strategy to acquire nuclear and biological weapons.
[Non-state actors]{.underline} particularly Bin Laden and his followers
[pursued first use policy]{.underline} and to use these weapons after
getting their hold on these weapons against their enemies or their
allies anywhere in the world. Bin Laden initiated his fight against US
believing it a holy war between Muslims and Christen-Jews Crusaders, to
change the status quo in international system. He thought once the
status quo is changed overall conditions would be conducive for the
organizations to overthrow the apostate regimes/governments in Islamic
states and Islamic Caliphate would be restored. In order to inflict
massive harm to its enemies Al Qaeda\'s strategy is focused on acquiring
\"strategic weapons.\" \"Documents seized in Afghan training camps in
late 2001 also indicate a rudimentary understanding of nuclear fission
devices.\" Khalid Sheikh Muhammad, mastermind of 9/11 attacks, was
interviewed by Al Jazeera in, 2002. Al Qaeda leader stated that \"Al
Qaeda initially planned to include a nuclear plant in its 2001 attack
sites, intensified concern about aircraft crashes.\" Acquisition of
poisonous material had remained of little interest for Al Qaeda. Al
Qaeda operatives were experimenting on \"crude chemical agents\" before
9/11 in its training camps in Afghanistan. However, their use was left
on the individuals outside Al Qaeda core leadership command. Abu Khabab
planned small scale chemical and biological activity, in 2002 and 2003
Abu Masab al Zarqawi planned attacks using ricin and cyanide in Europe
and Bahrain based terror group also devised a plan to carryout attack
using crude cyanide gas device in New York City subway. Al Qaeda top
leadership was kept uniformed of these attacks. Later, Al Zawahiri comes
to know about New York subway planned attack he cancelled it \"for
something better.\" After reading the preceding paragraphs it is
understood that unlike state actors, who are determined to acquire
nuclear weapons to boost their security and deter enemies,
[[terrorists]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[have three routes]{.mark} to
get hold on these weapons. [First acquire WMD. Second,
develop]{.mark}]{.underline} nuclear device or [[dirty bomb.
Thirdly]{.underline}]{.mark}, terrorist can carry-out [[attack]{.mark}
on [nuclear]{.mark} programme [sites]{.mark}/]{.underline}complexes.
Cont.... According to IAEA, 433 power plants and 240 operational nuclear
research reactors are operating internationally. Despite the fact that
measures are taken to deny the right of terrorists/non state actors to
acquire nuclear material, [[fissile material is produced in great
quantity - around the globe]{.underline}]{.mark} both for military
purposes and civilian needs. Such material is [dispersed at various
sites]{.underline} worldwide. [It is more difficult to maintain strict
control]{.underline} over fissile material than over nuclear weapons.
States posed with security threats are attempting to develop clandestine
nuclear weapons programme in violation of the Non Proliferation Treaty
(NPT). Iran is suspected by the US that it is violating the clauses of
the NPT and developing nuclear programme for military purposes.
Proliferators want to get nuclear weapons in order to employ them to
deter their enemies both potential and declared rather than use it.
However, [presence of huge stockpile of nuclear fissile
material,]{.underline} spread of nuclear weapons and existing nuclear
arsenals have created fear that [terrorists may either acquire or
construct a nuclear device]{.underline}. Legacy of the [[risk of nuclear
attack will persist]{.underline}]{.mark} as long as fissile material
exists.

\*\*\*Modified for language

Unfortunately, realism is often associated with the "abandon Taiwan"
arguments. Yet [realism]{.underline}, **[properly
understood]{.underline}**, [actually]{.underline} **[does
not]{.underline}** [call for the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [to]{.underline} ~~weaken~~ [\[decrease\] its
security commitment to Taiwan. Instead]{.underline}, **[[as China
rises]{.mark} in power]{.underline}**, [[realism predicts]{.mark}
a]{.underline} **[[strengthening]{.mark} of [U.S.-Taiwan
relations]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [a trend that is becoming]{.underline}
**[increasingly apparent today]{.underline}**. [The changing
international structure is **pushing Washington and Taipei into closer
security cooperation.**]{.underline}

[One]{.underline} vocal [["abandon Taiwan"]{.mark} argument
[employs]{.mark}]{.underline} a version of realism known [as ["defensive
realism."]{.mark}]{.underline} This version holds that the structure of
the international system does not necessarily favor competitive
policies; that the system is generally benign because it is often easier
to defend than to attack; that security is plentiful, competition
unnecessary; and rational states can credibly convey information about
their non-aggressive motives and intentions through costly signals and
policy choices. To avoid conflict, the United States can signal its
benign intentions by scaling back its security commitment to Taiwan. If
China reciprocates, such as on the South China Sea or other issues, it
would convey information about the limited extent of China's foreign
policy aims. China's rise, therefore, need not be competitive and
dangerous.

But [the problem is that [the historical record]{.mark} **often
[contradicts the dictates]{.mark} of defensive realism**]{.underline}:
[states often behave in ways **contrary to the theory's
prescriptions**]{.underline}. [[Defensive realism
is]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[normative]{.underline}]{.mark}** theory
that prescribes what states should do to achieve their goals, not how
they actually behave. [It is]{.underline}, in essence, **[idealism with
a realist facade]{.underline}**. As such, [it is]{.underline} **[not a
useful guide]{.underline}** [to state behavior]{.underline}.

[As]{.underline} John [Mearsheimer points out, defensive realist
theories]{.underline} **["do a poor job]{.underline}** [of accounting
for the past and present actions of]{.underline} the [major
powers]{.underline} in the international system."

A **[[more useful]{.underline}]{.mark}** strand of realism [[is
offensive realism]{.underline}]{.mark}, which posits that international
structure often favors competitive policies. [To be secure]{.underline}
in an anarchic world, [states]{.underline} **[need to maximize relative
power and compete for dominance]{.underline}**. [Given]{.underline} the
[limits]{.underline} of geography and technology, [the practical outcome
for a state is to become the hegemon in its own region]{.underline}. In
the 19th century, the United States accomplished this feat in the
western hemisphere through a series of determined pursuits of power. As
the regional hegemon, Washington enforced the Monroe Doctrine to exclude
outside powers from meddling in its backyard, while making sure no other
great power dominates another region.

[China]{.underline} **[is now trying]{.underline}** to do the same [in
East Asia. [Generations]{.mark} of]{.underline} Chinese [leaders
[recognize]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[a strong]{.mark}, powerful [China
is the best guarantee of]{.mark}]{.underline} national [[survival. The
"century of humiliation,"]{.underline}]{.mark} when a ~~weak~~
\[constrained\] China was invaded repeatedly, [[validates
the]{.underline} **[imperatives]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[of
power]{.underline}**. [Beijing goes to great lengths to
dismiss]{.underline} any hint of a future Chinese
[hegemony]{.underline}. **[But]{.underline}** [[if Chinese power
grows]{.mark} to surpass]{.underline} that of [the rest of East
Asia]{.underline} combined, [[it will]{.mark}, by definition, **[become
a]{.mark} regional [hegemon]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[This]{.underline} outcome [would **go [against U.S.]{.mark} national
[interest]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As the regional hegemon,
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[does not want peer competitors]{.underline}. [There is
**consensus**]{.underline} among U.S. policymakers and commentators
[that **it is in the national interest to prevent any power from
dominating Asia**]{.underline} (and Europe). [Even]{.underline} Henry
[Kissinger, whom China]{.underline} [considers an "old friend,"
stresses]{.underline} that ["it is in the American national interest to
resist the effort]{.underline} **[of any power]{.underline}** [to
dominate Asia]{.underline}" (emphasis original).

[Thus, [the changing]{.mark} international [structure **foretells a
competitive dynamic**]{.mark}]{.underline} [between the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
China]{.underline}. China's [[suspicions]{.underline}]{.mark} of U.S.
motives and intentions [[are structural]{.mark}ly-driven]{.underline},
just as U.S. suspicions of China are driven by the same structural
conditions. [[Uncertainty]{.mark} about intentions
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[built-in]{.underline}]{.mark}
characteristic of an anarchic system, **[[generating the security
dilemma]{.mark} and mutual distrust]{.underline}**.

[[How]{.underline}]{.mark}, then, [[does Taiwan fit in]{.mark}to this?
In the context of U.S.-China security competition,
[Washington]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[will have strong incentives to ramp
up security coop]{.mark}eration with Taiwan in order [to contain]{.mark}
the growth of [Chinese power]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

First, [[Taiwan's]{.mark} geostrategic [location is
of]{.mark}]{.underline} **[particular [value]{.mark}]{.underline}** [to
U.S. national security interests. [The island
controls]{.mark}]{.underline} the sea lines of communication
(**[[SLOCs]{.underline}]{.mark}**) extending from Japan to Southeast
Asia [[and serves as **a check on**]{.mark} **China's [maritime

**[E]{.underline}**ast [and]{.underline} the **[S]{.underline}**outh
**[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**eas.

**[If Washington wishes to maintain its preeminent position in Asia, it
is in the U.S. interest to include Taiwan]{.underline}** (along with
Japan, South Korea, and other allies) [in its overall Asia
strategy]{.underline}. **[[It makes]{.mark} good strategic
[sense]{.mark} for the United States [to help strengthen Taiwan's
defense]{.mark} capabilities in order [to deter
Beijing]{.mark}]{.underline}** [from attacking the island.

**[[ameliorate the power asymmetry]{.mark} across the Taiwan

**Lowther 13 --** William Lowther, Taipei Times, citing a report by the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, 3/16/13, "Taiwan Could
Spark Nuclear War: Report,"
<http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2013/03/16/2003557211>

[[Taiwan is the]{.underline} [most likely]{.underline}]{.mark}
[potential [crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} [[that could]{.underline}
[trigger]{.underline}]{.mark} [a [nuclear war]{.mark}]{.underline}
[between China and the US]{.underline}, a new academic report
concludes.¶ "Taiwan remains the single most plausible and dangerous
source of tension and conflict between the US and China," says the
42-page report by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS).¶ Prepared by the CSIS' Project on Nuclear
Issues and resulting from [a year-long study]{.underline}, the report
[emphasizes]{.underline} that [[Beijing continues to be]{.underline}
[set]{.underline}]{.mark} [on a policy [to prevent]{.mark} Taiwan's
[independence]{.mark},]{.underline} [while]{.underline} at the same time
[the US maintains the capability to come to Taiwan's
defense]{.underline}.¶ "Although tensions across the Taiwan Strait have
subsided since both Taipei and Beijing embraced a policy of engagement
in 2008, [[the situation remains combustible]{.underline}]{.mark},
[complicated [by]{.mark}]{.underline} [[rapidly diverging]{.mark}
cross-strait [military capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} [and persistent
political disagreements]{.underline}," the report says.¶ In a footnote,
it quotes senior fellow at the US Council on Foreign Relations Richard
Betts describing Taiwan as "the main potential flashpoint for the US in
East Asia."¶ The report also quotes Betts as saying that [neither
Beijing nor Washington can fully control developments that might ignite
a Taiwan crisis]{.underline}.¶ "[[This is a]{.underline}]{.mark} classic
[[recipe for]{.underline}]{.mark} surprise, [[miscalc]{.mark}ulation
[and]{.mark} uncontrolled [escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}," Betts wrote
in a separate study of his own.¶ The CSIS study says: "For the
foreseeable future [[Taiwan is]{.mark} the contingency in which nuclear
weapons would most likely become a major factor]{.underline},
[because]{.underline} the fate of [the island is
[intertwined]{.mark}]{.underline} both [[with the legitimacy of the
C]{.underline}]{.mark}hinese [[C]{.underline}]{.mark}ommunist
[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}arty [and the reliability of US defense
commitments]{.underline} in the Asia-Pacific region."¶ Titled Nuclear
Weapons and US-China Relations, the study says disputes in the East and
South China seas appear unlikely to lead to major conflict between China
and the US, but they do "provide kindling" for potential conflict
between the two nations because the disputes implicate a number of
important regional interests, including the interests of treaty allies
of the US.¶ The danger posed by flashpoints such as Taiwan, the Korean
Peninsula and maritime demarcation disputes is magnified by the
potential for mistakes, the study says.¶ "[Although Beijing and
Washington have]{.underline} agreed to [a range of crisis management
mechanisms,]{.underline} such as the Military Maritime Consultative
Agreement and the establishment of a direct hotline between the Pentagon
and the Ministry of Defense, [the [bases for miscommunication]{.mark}
and misunderstanding [remain]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and draw
on]{.underline} [deep]{.underline}]{.mark} [historical reservoirs of
[suspicion]{.mark}]{.underline}," the report says.¶ For example, it
says, [it is unclear whether either side understands what kinds of
actions would result in a military or]{.underline} even [nuclear
response]{.underline} [by the other]{.underline} party.¶ To make things
worse, "[[neither]{.mark} side [seems to believe the other's]{.mark}
declared policies and [intentions]{.mark}]{.underline},
[suggesting]{.underline} that [[escalation
management]{.underline}]{.mark}, already a very uncertain endeavor,
[[could be]{.underline} [especially difficult]{.underline}]{.mark} in
any conflict," it says.¶ Although conflict "mercifully" seems unlikely
at this point, the report concludes that "it cannot be ruled out and may
become increasingly likely if we are unwise or unlucky."¶ The report
says: "[[With]{.mark} both sides possessing]{.underline} and looking set
to retain [[formidable nuclear]{.mark} weapons
[arsenals]{.mark}]{.underline}, [such a [conflict would
be]{.mark}]{.underline} tremendously dangerous and quite possibly
[[devastating]{.underline}]{.mark}."

#### Every global hotpot goes [nuclear]{.underline} and it triggers [their impact]{.underline} by collapsing the economy

**Brands 15 --** Hal Brands, PhD in International Relations, Faculty at
the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University and the Elliott
School of International Affairs at George Washington University, "Fools
Rush Out? The Flawed Logic of Offshore Balancing", Washington Quarterly,
p. 7-28

The fundamental reason is that [both U.S. influence and international
stability are thoroughly interwoven with a robust U.S. forward
presence.]{.underline} Regarding influence, [the protection that
Washington has afforded its allies has equally afforded the United
States great sway over those allies' policies]{.underline}.43 [During
the Cold War and after]{.underline}, for instance, [the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has used the influence
provided by its security posture to veto allies' pursuit of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}, [to obtain more advantageous terms in financial
and trade agreements]{.underline}, and even to affect the composition of
allied nations' governments.44 More broadly, it has used its alliances
as vehicles for shaping political, security, and economic agendas in key
regions and bilateral relationships, thus giving the United States an
outsized voice on a range of important issues. To be clear, this
influence has never been as pervasive as U.S. officials might like, or
as some observers might imagine. But by any reasonable standard of
comparison, it has nonetheless been remarkable. [One can tell a similar
story about the relative stability of the post-war order]{.underline}.
As even some leading offshore balancers have acknowledged[, the lack of
conflict in regions like Europe in recent decades is not something that
has occurred naturally]{.underline}. [It has occurred because the
["American pacifier"]{.mark} has suppressed precisely the dynamics that
previously fostered geopolitical turmoil. That pacifier has [limited
**arms races** and]{.mark} security **[competitions]{.mark}** by
providing the protection that allows other countries to under-build
their militaries. It has soothed historical rivalries by affording a
climate of security in which powerful countries like Germany and Japan
could be revived economically and reintegrated into thriving and fairly
cooperative regional orders.]{.underline} [It has induced caution in the
behavior of allies and adversaries alike, **[deterring
aggression]{.mark}** and dissuading other destabilizing
behavior]{.underline}. As John Mearsheimer has noted, the United States
"effectively acts as a night watchman," lending order to an otherwise
disorderly and anarchical environment.45 [What would happen [if
Washington backed away]{.mark} from this role]{.underline}? The most
logical answer is that [both U.S. influence and [**global stability**
would suffer]{.mark}]{.underline}. [With respect to
influence,]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [would]{.underline} effectively [be surrendering
the most powerful bargaining chip it has traditionally wielded in
dealing with friends and allies,]{.underline} [and jeopardizing the
position of leadership it has used to shape bilateral and regional
agendas for decades. The consequences would seem no less damaging where
stability is concerned]{.underline}. As offshore balancers have argued,
it may be that U.S. retrenchment would force local powers to spend more
on defense, while perhaps assuaging certain points of friction with
countries that feel threatened or encircled by U.S. presence. But it
equally stands to reason that [removing the American pacifier would
liberate the more destabilizing influences that U.S. policy had
previously stifled. Long-dormant [security competitions might
reawaken]{.mark} as countries armed themselves more
vigorously]{.underline}; [historical antagonisms]{.underline} [between
old rivals might reemerge in the absence of a robust U.S. presence and
the reassurance it provides]{.underline}. Moreover, [countries that seek
to revise existing regional orders in their favor]{.underline}---think
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** in **[[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
or **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Asia---might indeed applaud U.S.
retrenchment, but [they [might]{.mark} just as plausibly feel empowered
to more [assertively press]{.mark} their interests]{.underline}. If the
United States has been a kind of Leviathan in key regions, Mearsheimer
acknowledges, then "[take away that Leviathan and there is likely to be
big trouble]{.underline}."46 Scanning the global horizon today, [one can
easily see where such trouble might arise. In Europe,]{.underline} [a
revisionist Russia is already destabilizing its neighbors and contesting
the post-Cold War settlement in the region.]{.underline} [In the Gulf
and broader Middle East, the threat of [Iran]{.mark}ian ascendancy has
[stoked]{.mark} region-wide tensions manifesting in [proxy wars]{.mark}
and hints of an incipient arms race, even as that region also contends
with a severe threat to its stability in the form of the Islamic State.
In East Asia, a rising China is challenging the regional status quo in
numerous ways, sounding alarms among its neighbors---many of whom also
have historical grievances against each other.]{.underline} In these
circumstances, [removing the American pacifier would likely yield not
low-cost stability, but increased conflict and upheaval. That conflict
and upheaval]{.underline}, in turn, [would be quite damaging to U.S.
interests]{.underline} even if it did not result in the nightmare
scenario of a hostile power dominating a key region. [[It is hard to
imagine]{.underline}]{.mark}, for instance, [that [increased
instability]{.mark} and acrimony [would produce]{.mark} the
[robust]{.mark} multilateral [cooperation]{.mark} necessary [to deal
with]{.mark} transnational threats from **[pandemics]{.mark}** to
piracy. More [problematic]{.mark} still [might be]{.mark} the
**[economic consequences]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As scholars like
Michael Mandelbaum have argued, [the [enormous]{.mark} progress toward
global [prosperity]{.mark} and integration that has occurred since World
War II]{.underline} (and now the Cold War) [[has come in the climate
of]{.mark} relative stability and [security provided]{.mark} largely by
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.47 [[One]{.mark} simply
[cannot]{.mark} confidently [predict]{.mark} that [this]{.mark} progress
[would endure]{.mark} amid escalating geopolitical competition in
regions of enormous importance to the world economy]{.underline}.
Perhaps [the greatest risk that a strategy of offshore balancing would
run]{.underline}, of course, [is that a key region might not be able to
maintain its own balance following U.S. retrenchment]{.underline}. That
prospect might have seemed far-fetched in the early post-Cold War era,
and it remains unlikely in the immediate future. But [in East Asia
particularly, the rise and growing assertiveness of China has
highlighted the medium- to long-term danger that a hostile power could
in fact gain regional primacy. If China's economy continues to grow
rapidly]{.underline}, and if Beijing continues to increase military
spending by 10 percent or more each year, [then its neighbors will
ultimately face grave challenges in containing Chinese power even if
they join forces in that endeavor]{.underline}. This possibility,
ironically, is one to which leading advocates of retrenchment have been
attuned. "The United States will have to play a key role in countering
China," Mearshimer writes, "because its Asian neighbors are not strong
enough to do it by themselves."48 If this is true, however, then
[offshore balancing becomes a dangerous and potentially self-defeating
strategy]{.underline}. As mentioned above, [[it could lead]{.mark}
countries like [Japan and]{.mark} South [Korea to seek **nuclear
weapons**]{.mark}]{.underline}, thereby [stoking arms races and
elevating regional tensions]{.underline}. Alternatively, and perhaps
more worryingly, [it might encourage the scenario that offshore
balancers seek to avoid, by easing China's ascent to regional
hegemony.]{.underline} As Robert Gilpin has written, "[Retrenchment by
its very nature is an indication of relative weakness and declining
power, and thus retrenchment can have a deteriorating effect on
relations with allies and rivals]{.underline}."49 [In East Asia today,
U.S. allies rely on U.S. reassurance to navigate increasingly fraught
relationships with a more assertive China precisely because they
understand that they will have great trouble balancing Beijing on their
own]{.underline}. A significant U.S. retrenchment might therefore tempt
these countries to acquiesce to, or bandwagon with, a rising China if
they felt that prospects for successful resistance were diminishing as
the United States retreated.50 In the same vein, retrenchment would
compromise alliance relationships, basing agreements, and other assets
that might help Washington check Chinese power in the first place---and
that would allow the United States to surge additional forces into
theater in a crisis. In sum, if one expects that Asian countries will be
unable to counter China themselves, then reducing U.S. influence and
leverage in the region is a curious policy. Offshore balancing might
promise to preserve a stable and advantageous environment while reducing
U.S. burdens. But upon closer analysis, the probable outcomes of the
strategy seem more perilous and destabilizing than its proponents
acknowledge.

given ample opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to a peaceful

[[Enabling Taiwan to defend itself is the best way]{.mark} out of this

prosperity and stability, they have reason to avoid costly conflict. [No

Over the past five years, senior members of both the George W. Bush and
Barack Obama administrations have exercised extreme caution when
evaluating Taiwan ' s requests for defense articles and services. These
policymakers may believe that China ' s cooperation on a range of global
issues -- and/or the ongoing progress in cross - Strait relations, such
as the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (EFCA) -- warrants
withholding release of any new or significant military equipment to
Taiwan. These U.S. policymakers may also be hoping for a substantive
draw - down of China ' s military posture opposite Taiwan, and may
believe that they are providing sufficient time for such a move to take
place. [Beijing should be rewarded for cooperation with the
U.S.]{.underline} on non - proliferation issues, global economic
security, climate change, and other issues. However, [such rewards
should not include U.S. abandonment of our security commitments to
Taiwan]{.underline}. Potential PRC reactions to U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan may warrant some caution, and [[Washington has to expect]{.mark}
some manner of [chastisement by Beijing when the U.S. provides
Taiwan]{.mark} with significant [security
assistance]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nevertheless, [[China should]{.mark}
also [expect]{.mark} that [its]{.mark} continued reliance on military
instruments of [coercion to resolve political differences will come at a
cost. Sound]{.mark} U.S. - China relations [rest upon the
assumption]{.mark} that [Beijing will adopt peaceful means to
resolve]{.mark} differences with [Taiwan]{.mark}. A]{.underline} de
facto [**[freeze on]{.mark} U.S. [arms sales to Taiwan]{.mark}**,
imposed [while the PRC continues to expand]{.mark} its military

"Assessing the Utility of New Fighter Aircraft for Taiwan's Defense
Needs," AEI, 3/13,
<http://www.aei.org/publication/assessing-the-utility-of-new-fighter-aircraft-for-taiwans-defense-needs/>

Apple Daily broke the news last week that [Taiwan's]{.underline}
Ministry of National Defense ([MND]{.underline}) has [submitted a formal
letter of request (LOR) to the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [for new fighter jets]{.underline}. Although
Apple Daily reported that the request was specifically for 66 new
F-16Vs, MND denied that. According to the head of Air Force Command's
Planning Division, "[The F-15, F-18, F-16, and even]{.underline} the
[F-35, are]{.underline} all [among our options, as long as the [jets
**help**]{.mark} **to [strengthen]{.mark} our [air defense
capabilities]{.mark}.**]{.underline} \[...\] We are still awaiting a US
response on what kind of aircraft it is willing to sell us before we
evaluate if that model fits our needs and if we can afford it before
making a final decision."

[MND has long had a stated requirement for]{.underline} **[new,
modern]{.underline}** [fighter aircraft and]{.underline} **[has been
seeking to purchase them]{.underline}** [from the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [since]{.underline}
President George [W]{.underline}. Bush's second term. The requirement
has been a controversial one, less so in Taiwan than in the United
States, where [some see new fighters as a waste of money]{.underline}
and apparently question MND's ability to conduct honest, thorough
assessments of Taiwan's defense needs.

Christopher [[Twomey]{.underline}]{.mark}, a well-respected professor at
the Naval Postgraduate School, [[was quick to]{.mark} disparage Taiwan's
Air Force]{.underline} following news of the LOR,
[[tweet]{.mark}ing]{.underline}: "Note to ROCAF: the 1990s called and
they want their net assessment of the \[military balance\] across the
Taiwan Strait back. Taiwan needs a thicket of mobile SAMs to defend air
sovereignty. Don't play the PLA's game. **[[Go porcupine or go
home!"]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The so-called "porcupine strategy" was first popularized by US Naval War
College professor William S. Murray in a 2008 article in the Naval War
College Review. Professor Murray described the strategy in this way:

More affordable, more effective, and less destabilizing means of defense
against precision bombardment, invasion, and blockade are nonetheless
available, but to take advantage of them, Taiwan must rethink its
defense strategies. Rather than trying to destroy incoming ballistic
missiles with costly PAC-3 SAMs \[surface-to-air missiles\], Taiwan
should harden key facilities and build redundancies into critical
infrastructure and processes so that it could absorb and survive a
long-range precision bombardment. Rather than relying on its navy and
air force (neither of which is likely to survive such an attack) to
destroy an invasion force, Taiwan should concentrate on development of a
professional standing army armed with mobile, short-range, defensive
weapons. To withstand a prolonged blockade, Taiwan should stockpile
critical supplies and build infrastructure that would allow it to attend
to the needs of its citizens unassisted for an extended period. Finally,
Taiwan should eschew destabilizing offensive capabilities, which could
include, in their extreme form, tactical nuclear weapons employed in a
countervalue manner, or less alarmingly, long-range conventional weapons
aimed against such iconic targets as the Three Gorges Dam.

By adopting such a strategy, Taiwan "would be able to thwart a
decapitation attempt," and thus deter Beijing from making the attempt in
the first place. Put another way, Taiwan would make itself impossible to
swallow, thus making invasion and occupation an unappealing option for
the People's Republic of China.

[[Unfortunately for proponents of the "porcupine]{.mark} strategy,"
[invasion and occupation]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[are not the only,
or]{.mark} perhaps even the [most likely]{.mark}**[, option for]{.mark}
a [Beijing]{.mark} that determines]{.underline} that a resort to [force
across the Taiwan Strait is necessary. [**Nor** do]{.mark} their
[assumptions]{.mark}]{.underline} about how a war would go necessarily
[[hold up]{.mark} to close scrutiny]{.underline}.

[[Consider]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example, an increase in [Chinese
military pressure]{.underline} that falls [short of violence,
such]{.underline} as repeated [[transgressions]{.mark} of the median
line in the]{.underline} Taiwan [Strait and]{.underline} incursions of
Taiwan [airspace]{.underline} by the People's Liberation Army Air Force
fighter aircraft. [[If Taiwan were to depend on]{.mark} surface-to-air
[missiles]{.mark}]{.underline} to defend its air sovereignty, [[its
**only option**]{.underline}]{.mark} in such a scenario [would
be]{.underline} for SAM batteries to [light up the offending
aircraft]{.underline} with targeting radar. [Such [is]{.mark}
a]{.underline} **[[highly escalatory]{.mark} step]{.underline}**, [which
would risk **[inviting]{.mark} Chinese [strikes]{.mark}**]{.underline}
on those batteries[. [It would be far better]{.mark} for Taipei
[to]{.mark} instead **[dispatch]{.mark} fighter
[jets]{.mark}**]{.underline} to intercept, warn, shadow, and, if
ultimately necessary, lock on to Chinese fighters. In this case,
Taiwan's Air Force (Republic of China Air Force, or [ROCAF]{.underline})
[[fighters provide]{.mark} Taiwan]{.underline} with the [[ability
to]{.mark} respond proportionately]{.underline} to the PLA offense [and
to **more [gradually escalate]{.mark}**]{.underline} the engagement.

[Importantly, Taiwan's [fighters must]{.mark} be able to
[match]{.mark}]{.underline} their [[Chinese counterparts]{.mark} in
speed and combat power. [If they do not, Chinese
pilots]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[will not]{.mark} take Taiwan's [warnings
seriously]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Indeed, a [mismatch]{.mark} in
capability [would **invite Chinese hot-dogging**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[in which PLA pilots have]{.underline} previously
[indulged]{.underline}, particularly over the South China Sea.
**[Hence[, the need]{.mark} for a modern fighter jet]{.underline}**.

[Fighter jets [would likewise be useful in]{.mark} more stressful
scenarios, like]{.underline} during [a]{.underline}n air or maritime
[[blockade]{.underline}]{.mark}. [A Taiwan military that relied
predominantly on]{.underline} land-based [[missiles]{.underline}]{.mark}
to defend itself during such operations [would, again,
[have]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[limited options to
respond]{.underline}**]{.mark} and to escalate
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} it would, in fact, **[[invite]{.mark} more
widespread Chinese [strikes]{.mark}]{.underline}** on the island [[in a
scenario]{.mark} in which [Beijing]{.mark} **apparently [prefers to
minimize escalation]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

### Link\-\--Capabilities\-\--Jets\-\--A2: China Targets

[Even in the invasion scenario]{.underline}, fighter **[jets have a role
to play]{.underline}**. [["Porcupine]{.underline}]{.mark} strategy"
[[adherents]{.underline}]{.mark} generally [[argue]{.underline}]{.mark}
that [[the PLA will target]{.underline}]{.mark} [bunkers,
[aircraft]{.mark} shelters, and runways]{.underline} in the
[early]{.underline} stages of a conflict---many jets would be destroyed
on the ground and those that survived would be unable to take off.
Certainly, this would be a PLA priority.

The Project 2049 Institute's Ian [Easton, however]{.underline},
**[persuasively argues]{.underline}** in his book, The Chinese Invasion
Threat, [that [this is **not**]{.mark} **such a [simple]{.mark}
task**]{.underline} for the PLA [and that **[even]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[PLA [commanders believe **they will**]{.mark} **ultimately [have to
contend with]{.mark} ROCAF fighter [jets]{.mark}**]{.underline} [taking
to the sky]{.underline}. On the one hand, Easton admits, "No one in
Taiwan's defense planning circles harbors any illusion that the air
force could emerge from ballistic missile and cruise missile attacks in
the same fashion it went into them. \[...\] Early [[losses]{.mark} [are
expected]{.mark} to be heavy]{.underline}." [**[But]{.underline}** [not
so heavy]{.underline}]{.mark} [as [to]{.mark}]{.underline} effectively
[[eliminate the air force]{.underline}]{.mark} as a factor in the fight:

[[Steps]{.underline}]{.mark} taken [during]{.underline} the
[mobilization and force preservation]{.underline} stage [of the
anti-invasion]{.underline} plan are intended to [[ensure]{.mark} that
[China would stand]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[little
chance]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[of seizing]{.mark} air
[superiority]{.mark}]{.underline} in the first days of conflict. [In the
minds of even optimistic PLA planners]{.underline}, the **[[ROC
A]{.underline}]{.mark}**ir **[[F]{.underline}]{.mark}**orce
[[represents]{.underline}]{.mark} a fleet-in-being, [[a]{.mark} vague
[menace whose]{.mark}]{.underline} full [[strength]{.mark}
and]{.underline} wartime [role]{.underline} **[[cannot be calculated
out]{.mark} of the equation]{.underline}**. [[Only the **most
foolish**]{.underline}]{.mark} of generals [[disregards a mighty air
force]{.mark} hiding]{.underline} **[[dispersed]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[and]{.underline} **[deep in the mountains,]{.underline}** [waiting to
strike out]{.underline} at a time and place of its choosing.

[And]{.underline} **[strike out they would]{.underline}**. [In addition
to striving to deny PLA air superiority, [Taiwan's fighters would
be]{.mark} tasked with [striking]{.mark}
[airfields]{.mark},]{.underline} docked [[ships]{.underline}]{.mark},
ground transportation [[infrastructure, logistics,]{.mark} and
[radars]{.mark}]{.underline} in China [as well as
amphibious]{.underline} assault [[ships]{.mark}, escort vessels,
[minesweepers, and helicopters]{.mark}]{.underline} approaching
Taiwanese shores. [[Fighters would not be alone]{.underline}]{.mark} in
those tasks, [with]{.underline} surface-launched cruise and ballistic
[missiles]{.underline}, capital [ships]{.underline}, small missile
[boats, submarines]{.underline}, attack [helicopters]{.underline},
multiple launch [rocket systems, and drones]{.underline} all
contributing to the fight. [This [diversity of]{.mark} strike
[options]{.mark}]{.underline} **[vastly [complicates PLA
planning]{.mark}]{.underline}** in a way that a predominant or sole
reliance on land-based missiles would not.

Thirteen years later, [[Taiwan's submarine arm]{.mark} still [consists
of]{.mark} two ex-Dutch submarines and two]{.underline} boats most of
whose peers are now [**[museum exhibits]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Years of
on-again, off-again discussions have not resulted in an actual sale from
the United States or any other nation. More seriously, there has also
been no movement in facilitating American shipwrights' and experts'
engagement with their Taiwanese counterparts to allow Taiwan to build
its own boats.

Taiwan's Maritime Security Situation

[[An island]{.underline}]{.mark} nation, [Taiwan is]{.underline} **[one
of the most densely populated territories on earth]{.underline}**,
[with]{.underline} over [630 persons per square kilometer. The 23
million]{.underline} people [on the island are]{.underline} almost
**[wholly [dependent on imports]{.mark}]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
both [food and energy]{.underline}.

[Equally important, [Taiwan's security]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[depends]{.underline}** [on]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [ability to
challenge]{.mark} the ability of the]{.underline} Chinese People's
Liberation Army ([PLA]{.underline}) [to cross the islands and mount [an
invasion, or]{.mark} impose a [blockade]{.mark}]{.underline} that would
leave the residents starving and in the dark. [The PLA]{.underline}'s
main planning [guidelines appear to **focus, still, on taking
Taiwan**]{.underline}. The [[PLA]{.underline}]{.mark}'s best
[[forces]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and much of its [strategic and
operational thinking, appear]{.mark} to be [oriented to]{.mark}ward
either **[taking Taiwan or countering]{.mark} any [America]{.mark}n
attempt to prevent such Chinese actions**]{.underline}.

[Because of the disparity in]{.underline} physical [size, economy, and
geography, Taiwan's maritime security in the face of the Chinese threat
is a challenging problem. China has]{.underline} the [wherewithal
to]{.underline} simultaneously [bombard Taiwan]{.underline} (especially
with its large arsenal of short-range and medium-range ballistic
missiles), [while]{.underline} also [being able to deploy forces farther
afield]{.underline} of Taiwan's immediate environment. [[For Taipei, the
key]{.mark} to a successful defense of the island [is
to]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[hold out]{.mark} long enough [for the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates to intervene decisively]{.underline}**.
[[Taiwan]{.mark}'s military [must]{.mark} therefore be able to
simultaneously [defend the island, while]{.mark} also nonetheless [being
able to deny]{.mark} the [Chinese]{.mark} regime the [ability to]{.mark}
easily or rapidly [isolate the island]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Submarines have]{.underline} **[long played a
role]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in Taiwan's defense
calculations]{.underline}**. [[Given]{.mark} the relative [weakness of
China's anti-sub]{.mark}]{.underline}marine
[[warfare]{.underline}]{.mark} capabilities,
[[submarines]{.underline}]{.mark} would [[pose a]{.underline}
**[significant threat]{.underline}**]{.mark} to any amphibious force.
Indeed, [the record of the [British]{.mark}]{.underline} Royal Navy
[during the Falklands [would suggest a **disproportionate
effect**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[from even a
**handful**]{.underline}]{.mark} [of]{.underline} **[modern
submarines]{.underline}**. On the one hand, [the sinking of the
Argentine cruiser]{.underline} General Belgrano [led the Argentines to
withdraw]{.underline} **[all naval forces]{.underline}** from the
British-declared exclusion zone.

At the same time, **[however]{.underline}**, [even though the Royal Navy
was considered the premier anti-sub]{.underline}marine
[force]{.underline} in NATO, [it]{.underline} **[failed]{.underline}**
[to find the Argentine sub]{.underline} ARA San Luis.\[1\] That boat
managed to remain at sea for over a month, and despite the best efforts
of NATO's premier anti-submarine force, was apparently able to operate
relatively unhindered. The Royal Navy expended substantial amounts of
ordnance against a variety of false contacts, depleting its stocks for
no real effect.\[2\] [Indeed]{.underline}, but for problems with its
fire control system, [that]{.underline} Argentine [sub]{.underline}
**[might well have changed the course of the battle]{.underline}**, as
[it]{.underline} **[repeatedly]{.underline}** [achieved firing
solutions]{.underline} on elements of the British task force.\[3\]

[[In light of the **importance**]{.mark} **of submarines**]{.underline},
[[and]{.mark} given [Taiwan's]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[aging
fleet]{.underline}**, [the U.S]{.underline}.]{.mark} in April 2001
**[[committed to helping]{.mark} Taiwan acquire up to eight
diesel-electric submarines.]{.underline}** This commitment was
complicated by the reality that the United States has not built
diesel-electric submarines since the 1950s, as the U.S. Navy
transitioned to an all-nuclear power submarine force. As the U.S. has no
intention of transferring nuclear-powered subs to Taiwan, the United
States was, in effect, promising to help Taiwan acquire such systems
from third parties.

#### [Modern subs]{.underline} are key to Taiwan's defense -- arms sales shape [deterrence]{.underline} when China is becoming [extremely aggressive]{.underline}

[[It is in U.S.]{.mark} security [interests]{.mark} to ensure [that
Taiwan maintains a sufficient]{.mark}ly robust [defense
that]{.mark}]{.underline} it **[[can deter Chinese
aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [especially [as China has
become]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[increasingly
assertive]{.underline}**]{.mark} [throughout the East Asian littoral in
recent years]{.underline}. The relatively quiet state of the Taiwan
Straits may well change after the 2016 Taiwan presidential elections,
particularly given likely Chinese reaction to a Democratic Progressive
Party victory. Recent Chinese actions toward Hong Kong have probably
torpedoed any prospect of the "one country, two systems" approach that
Beijing has long proffered to Taiwan. [The]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [should:]{.underline}

Allow the "Conception Definition and Design Source Selection" phase to
proceed promptly. Congress should direct the Department of State to
either allow this to move forward, or provide a formal explanation on
why it is failing to do so.

[Allow American]{.underline} shipbuilders and weapons [manufacturers to
cooperate with Taiwan]{.underline}ese corporations in assessing Taiwan's
capabilities and forward bids on relevant sensors and weapons systems.
At the same time, [the U.S. should also allow the sale of additional
submarine weapons]{.underline} (e.g., submarine-launched Harpoon
missiles) that are already in the Taiwanese inventory.

Continue to encourage other manufacturers of conventional
(diesel-electric) submarines to cooperate with Taiwan. The prospect of
Japan engaging in arms sales, and specifically the export of submarines
to Australia, raises the possibility of additional, non-traditional
suppliers who might be additional sources of either submarine
technology, or even completed boats.

[Taiwan's [defense]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[would be strengthened
with]{.mark} more [modern submarines]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [The
U.S]{.underline}]{.mark}[., as Taiwan's]{.underline} best, and often
**[only, friend]{.underline}**, [[should help]{.mark} Taipei acquire an
underwater force, [which would benefit]{.mark} not only Taiwan, but
[America's defense]{.mark} posture]{.underline} in the western Pacific.
To this end, the United States should provide options that enable Taiwan
to meet its requirements in the most cost-effective way possible.
Because leaving Taiwan with a single---extremely costly---option for
fulfilling its defense needs puts Taiwan's democracy and defense in a
very precarious position.

#### [US/China ties]{.underline} and [lessened assurances]{.underline} of Taiwan risk [cross-straight war]{.underline}

Logically, the outcome that would be best for the United States is a
victory by Eric Chu, because his cross-Strait policies would be
consistent with Ma Ying-jeou's, which have reduced the salience of the
Taiwan issue in a U.S.-China relationship littered with other problems.
But even as Washington officials might hope for the best, they watch the
Taiwan polls as closely as anyone. They know that if Tsai is elected,
[[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} will have to work with
her in order to protect its interests. Hence, they [[extended Tsai a
proper welcome]{.underline}]{.mark} when she visited the United States
in June 2015, [[and took note of]{.mark} the [reassurance she offered
about her future policies]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the same time, they
know that [[Beijing has]{.mark} a very [different view]{.mark} of the
reliability of Tsai's promises]{.underline} and that it may not respond
with the flexibility and restraint that they have encouraged. If Xi
Jinping and his colleagues are bluffing (scenario three) and are willing
to accommodate to Tsai because of her victory, then cross-Strait
relations will continue much as it has in the last few years. That would
be acceptable for the United States, as would my variant of scenario one
(freezing cross-Strait interaction, limited punishment, plus a
wait-and-see attitude). But any version of scenario one comes with the
risk that accident or misperception might eventually lead to
deterioration in Taiwan-Mainland ties. Worst for the United States is
full scenario two: a freezing of cross-Strait relations accompanied by
comprehensive punishment. If scenario two occurs, the United States will
probably have to return to dual deterrence. It cannot withdraw from the
cross-Strait contest altogether because U.S. allies and partners would
likely read withdrawal as a sign that the U.S. security commitments to
them are no longer dependable. It cannot bless Tsai Ing-wen's policies
without qualification because that would create the possibility of
"blank check" dynamics that complicated U.S.-Taiwan relations during the
last six years of the Chen Shui-bian administration. [[Urging each side
to exercise restraint]{.mark} and flexibility and warning against a
unilateral change in the status quo by either side [will]{.mark}
continue to [make sense]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Under scenario
two, Washington will have to repeatedly judge which side is more
responsible for damaging the positive state of cross-Strait relations
that it has valued since 2008. Both Beijing and Taipei will try to blame
the other for any increased tensions and each would appeal to different
principles to make its case. Beijing will cite the U.S.'s declared
non-support for Taiwan independence and Taiwan will assert that Tsai's
policies reflect the will of the people as expressed through democratic
elections. Each will have its own narrative about how the other is at
fault and will seek to find points of leverage with Washington. [[Part
of dual deterrence is]{.mark} being willing to provide each side with
appropriate [reassurances]{.mark}. **[Washington must make it clear to
Taipei]{.mark} through word and deed [that it will not abandon it
because it places a higher priority on its relations with China or is
unwilling to face Beijing]{.mark}**]{.underline} if it unilaterally
attempts to change the status quo. And, Washington should continue to
remind Beijing that it does not support Taiwan independence. At the same
time, [[the United States must warn Taipei that it should exercise
restraint]{.mark} in taking initiatives that objectively bear on China's
interests]{.underline}. Simultaneously, it should continue to warn
Beijing of its "abiding interest" in peace and stability, and that China
has an obligation along with Taiwan to help preserve it. [The [degree
of]{.mark} mutual [dependence]{.mark} among all three parties [is too
great to risk]{.mark} an unnecessary [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Dual deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}, which may well be Washington's
best option for protecting its interest in peace and stability going
forward, [[is never easy]{.underline}]{.mark}. It was hard to implement
during the 1995-2008 period. Since then, U.S.-China relations have
become more competitive and less cooperative. China's national power has
grown relative to that of both the United States and Taiwan. Some of the
latter's weaknesses are self-induced, the result of a dysfunctional
system that only its leaders can address. **[The [credibility of
Washington's]{.mark}]{.underline}** warnings and
**[[reassurances]{.underline}]{.mark}** in this new context **[[will
be]{.underline}]{.mark}** as **[[significant]{.underline}]{.mark}** as
the words that officials utter to their counterparts on each side of the
Taiwan Strait. Despite the objective and subjective changes in the
balance of power, it will be Taiwan's voters who will pick their
leaders, as they should. Beijing will make its own judgment about the
implications of the results for all of its interests, and one can only
hope that its assessment and the actions that follow will not stem from
unfounded analysis and an exaggerated feeling of vulnerability. [[Within
the complex interplay of Taiwan's democracy and China's fears]{.mark}
and ambitions, [the United States will have to make its
way]{.mark}]{.underline}.

\*\*\*Modified for language

Despite the real military requirement for fighters, a common refrain of
the "porcupine strategy" crowd is that Taiwan seeks the aircraft purely
for their symbolic value. While this is patently not the case, it is
important to consider that [[symbolic value is]{.underline}]{.mark}, in

of]{.mark} new fighter [aircraft]{.mark} from the]{.underline}

[it is worth considering that the [sale would include]{.mark} not only

[The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates on
Sept. 24 [announced]{.underline} a [new]{.underline} set of [arms
sales]{.underline} to Taiwan. Valued at \$330 million, this sale
comprises mainly spare parts and equipment to support Taiwan's air
force, including its F-16s and C-130s.

[This marks the second major arms sale to Taiwan by]{.underline} the
[Trump]{.underline} administration, following a \$1.4 billion sale in
June 2017 that included long-range missiles and heavy torpedoes.

Not surprisingly, Beijing promptly denounced the sale. The Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman declared that "the U.S. arms sales to Taiwan
severely violates the international law \[and\] the basic norms
governing international relations."

The Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman warned that the U.S. move
severely violated U.S.-China relations, "interfered with China's
domestic affairs and harmed China's sovereignty and security interests,
and seriously damaged China-U.S. ties, relations between the two
militaries, as well as peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait."

The arms sales announcement came not only amid another round of tariffs
in the slowly escalating trade clashes between the United States and
China, but also right after the U.S. imposed sanctions against the
Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA).

Because the Chinese purchased Su-35 fighter jets and S-400
surface-to-air missiles from Russia, the U.S. announced sanctions
required by the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act
of 2017 against the PLA's Equipment Development Department and its
director, Lt. Gen. Li Shangfu.

The Chinese, meanwhile, canceled a meeting between Vice Adm. Shen
Jinlong (head of the Chinese navy) and U.S. Chief of Naval Operations
John Richardson with only 48 hours' notice.

They also denied the USS Wasp access to Hong Kong for a port call. It is
unclear whether these Chinese actions are more in response to the
sanctions or the arms sales, or perhaps the broader deterioration of
U.S.-China ties.

[The [new arms sales]{.mark} will]{.underline} **[[help Taiwan
maintain]{.mark} some semblance of [credibility]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[in its own defense, especially in the air. [As China
has]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[increased]{.mark} its [pressure]{.mark} on
Taiwan]{.underline}** ([e.g., employing financial diplomacy to erode
Taiwan's diplomatic standing]{.underline}), [[preserving]{.mark}
Taiwan's]{.underline} ability to maintain control of its own
[[airspace]{.underline} **[will be
vital]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}**

[[They are part of **a larger mosaic of U.S. efforts to express
support**]{.mark} **for Taiwan**]{.underline}, [[including
the]{.underline}]{.mark} 2018 [Taiwan [Travel Act]{.mark}]{.underline},
the decision of then-President-elect Donald Trump to take a [[call

[[Tsai]{.underline}]{.mark} Ing-wen, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
recent [opening of a new]{.underline} U.S. [[diplomatic facility]{.mark}

[This is an]{.underline} **[important policy]{.underline}**. [[As
Taiwan's most vital partner, the U.S]{.underline}. **[must
push]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[back [against Chinese
encroachment]{.mark}]{.underline}** on it. [If it does not, **[no one

**[long-standing bipartisan precedent]{.underline}**, set by every

### A2: Credibility Theory False

#### Policymakers [believe]{.underline} it 

**Tang 5** -- Shiping Tang, associate research fellow and deputy
director of the Center for Regional Security Studies at the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, January-March, "Reputation, Cult
of Reputation, and International Conflict," Security Studies, Vol. 14,
No. 1, p. 34-62

The problem, of course, is that [[politicians]{.underline}]{.mark}
usually **[[do not have]{.underline}]{.mark}** such [[**nuanced
understandings** of cred]{.mark}ibility]{.underline}, reputation,
[resolve, and capability]{.underline}.24 Too often, [[they]{.mark}
[fight]{.mark} for]{.underline} behavioral [reputation]{.underline} for
resolve and hope [[to improve]{.mark} their bargaining reputation (thus
[credibility) in the future]{.mark}]{.underline}. By doing so, they
confuse themselves, mislead their domestic audiences, and squander their
countries' blood and treasure for the wrong commodity. In fact, most
strategists and politicians have either lumped the two kinds of
reputation together or believed that behavioral reputation can easily be
converted into bargaining reputation (that is, [[they]{.mark} have
[believe]{.mark}d]{.underline} that [[commitments are **interdependent**
or]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[reputation is
**fungible**]{.underline}]{.mark}). Because developing and maintaining a
behavioral reputation for being resolute is desirable, many politicians
and strategists undertake certain tasks ex ante to develop such a
reputation, without ever questioning whether having a behavioral
reputation is possible at all. [[This]{.mark} practice]{.underline}, as
discussed below, [[informs]{.underline}]{.mark} one central belief
behind [[the **cult of reputation**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Perhaps
[[because behavior]{.mark}al reputation]{.underline} is something that
[[may count]{.mark} in the future]{.underline}, moreover, [[it is the
type]{.underline}]{.mark} of reputation [[about which decisionmakers are
most]{.mark} [concerned]{.mark}]{.underline}.25 In fact, decisionmakers
actually may bargain hard largely because they care more about their
future behavioral reputation. This article thus focuses on behavioral
reputation for resolve (which hereafter will be referred to as
"reputation" unless specified otherwise).

#### Theory's true -- strong empirical basis

**Gibler 8** (Douglas M., Professor of Political Science -- University
of Alabama, "The Costs of Reneging: Reputation and Alliance Formation",
Journal of Conflict Resolution, 52(3), June, p. 4)

[More sophisticated [treatments of]{.mark} the [reputation logic have
been produced by **formal theorists**]{.mark}, both [in **economics**
and]{.mark} in **[political science]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
economics, the ability of firm reputation to deter competition has been
well analyzed (see Kreps and Wilson, 1982; Wilson, 1989; and Weigelt and
Camerer, 1988), and political scientists have adopted these theories as
tools in understanding the types of signals leaders can send (see for
example, Alt, Calvert, and Humes, 1988; Ordeshook, 1986; and Wagner,
1992). Sartori (2002) and Guisinger and Smith (2002) probably go
furthest in arguing that [leaders]{.underline} and their envoys [have
incentives to develop]{.underline} certain types of
[[reputations]{.underline}]{.mark} in order [to
[overcome]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[uncertainty]{.underline}]{.mark}
endemic to crisis diplomacy. In these models, [a reputation for [honesty
allows the sender to credibly give information]{.mark} that would
otherwise be "cheap talk", [and]{.mark}]{.underline} thus, [[leaders may
concede less important issues, without bluffing]{.underline}]{.mark}, in
order to maintain a reputation for honesty when more important issues
arise (Sartori, 2002: 122). [The sum argument]{.underline} of these
statements and theoretical treatments [is clear.
**[Decision-makers]{.mark} argue and [act]{.mark}**]{.underline}, at
least in part, **[based [on reputations]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Traditional deterrence theory suggests reputations should be pursued by
leaders as important and manipulable tools, which are useful in future
crises. [Formal theorists agree]{.underline}; reputations provide
valuable information when the costs of signaling are low.

### A2: Deterrence Resilient\-\--Nuke Umbrella

#### Nuclear umbrella alone is insufficient -- three warrants -- stability/instability paradox renders massive retaliation not credible, conventional means resolve de-coupling risks, and US opposition to mutual vulnerability

**[S]{.underline}**tates has [set out this comprehensive approach **[as

[alone]{.mark}**]{.underline} [for three]{.underline} basic [reasons.
First, [the threat]{.mark} of]{.underline} U.S. [nuclear
use]{.underline} **[[may not]{.mark} always [be
credible]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in the eyes of]{.underline} the
[individual(s) the United States might seek to deter. [Some]{.mark}
enemy [may convince itself]{.mark} that [there are forms]{.mark} of
nuclear attack]{.underline} (or other forms of attack) [that fall
[beneath the]{.mark} U.S. response [threshold]{.mark}]{.underline}. For
example, [an enemy might believe]{.underline} that [nuclear
attack]{.underline} primarily [to generate]{.underline}
**[e]{.underline}**lectro**[m]{.underline}**agnetic
**[p]{.underline}**ulse [effects]{.underline} on nearby conventional
forces [might escape a U.S. nuclear response]{.underline}. **[[This
could be a]{.mark} serious [miscalculation]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[but]{.underline}]{.mark}, from a deterrence perspective, this scenario
[[highlights]{.mark} the **[value of supplemental]{.mark} non-nuclear
[elements]{.mark}** in the deterrence architecture. Second, whether or
not nuclear threats are credible]{.underline}, the [[non-nuclear
components]{.underline}]{.mark} of this strategy **[[offer]{.mark}
valuable [deterrence benefits]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} For
example, **[[b]{.underline}]{.mark}**allistic
**[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**issile **[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**efense of
the U.S. homeland [[mitigates de-coupling]{.mark} risks
[by]{.mark}]{.underline} greatly reducing if not [[eliminating
risks]{.mark} run]{.underline} by the United States in
[defending]{.underline} its [allies]{.underline}. [And
**b**]{.underline}allistic **[m]{.underline}**issile
**[d]{.underline}**efense [within the region protects **key
assets**]{.underline} [from an enemy's preemptive strikes, enables
offensive operations]{.underline} to begin at a time of our choosing
rather than the enemy's, [and raises the scale of attack]{.underline}
that [an attacker must attempt]{.underline} if it wants [to
overwhelm]{.underline} the [defense]{.underline} ([severely limiting the
credibility of threats]{.underline} to launch a small number of weapons
while holding more in reserve). [[These]{.mark} strategic
[benefits]{.mark}]{.underline} [help to **[reduce the role of nuclear
weapons in regional deterrence architectures]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[even while a core element remains]{.underline}, given the fundamental
role of nuclear weapons in deterring nuclear attack. [Third, [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates **flatly [rejects]{.mark}** [mutual
vulnerability]{.mark}]{.underline} as the basis of the strategic
relationship with states like North Korea and Iran that violate
international obligations, destabilize their regions and threaten their
neighbors, and threaten the United States with nuclear attack.
[[The]{.mark} global security [environment would become]{.mark} **deeply
[unstable]{.mark}** [if]{.mark} such [states]{.mark} were to
[conclude]{.mark} that [they are]{.mark} free [under their own nuclear

Further from a U.S. perspective, [partnership with [allies

interaction]{.underline} between the two communities "[might create

proposal that Russia re-locate tactical nuclear weapons away from the
Euro-Atlantic security environment has sparked concern in Japan, as it
appears that NATO is seeking to export its problems to East Asia, much
as it seemed ready to do in the early 1980s when many in NATO advocated
for re-location of Soviet nuclear-tipped intermediate-range nuclear
forces to somewhere East of the Ural mountains (where they might have
targeted Japan).21 Yukio Satoh has argued that: "the Strategic Concept
adopted at NATO's Lisbon Summit in 2010...fell short of what Japan had
expected of NATO: a global perspective from which to address the issue
of nuclear weapons."22

## \*\*\* IMPACT

### Allied Confidence\-\--A2: No Impact

#### Lack of Asian ally confidence in US triggers multiple wars throughout the region and wrecks global leadership

**Goh, 8** -- Lecturer in International Relations in the Department of
Politics and International Relations at the University of Oxford
(Evelyn, International Relations of the Asia-Pacific, "Hierarchy and the
role of the United States in the East Asian security order," 2008
8(3):353-377, Oxford Journals Database)

The centrality of these mutual processes of assurance and deference
means that the stability of a hierarchical order is fundamentally
related to a collective sense of certainty about the leadership and
order of the hierarchy. This certainty is rooted in a combination of
material calculations -- smaller states\' assurance that the expected
costs of the dominant state conquering them would be higher than the
benefits -- and ideational convictions -- the sense of legitimacy,
derived from shared values and norms that accompanies the super-ordinate
state\'s authority in the social order. The empirical analysis in the
next section shows that [regional [stability in East
Asia]{.mark}]{.underline} in the post-Second World War years [can be
[correlated to]{.mark} the [degree of]{.mark} collective [certainty
about]{.mark} the [US-]{.mark}led regional [hierarchy]{.mark}. East
Asian [stability]{.mark} and instability has been [determined by U.S.
assurances]{.mark}, self-confidence, and commitment to maintaining its
primary position in the regional hierarchy; the [perceptions and
confidence of regional states]{.mark} about US commitment]{.underline};
and the reactions of subordinate states in the region to the varied
challengers to the regional hierarchical order. 4. Hierarchy and the
East Asian security order Currently, [the regional hierarchy in East
Asia is still dominated by the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. Since the 1970s, China has increasingly claimed
the position of second-ranked great power, a claim that is today
legitimized by the hierarchical deference shown by smaller subordinate
powers such as South Korea and Southeast Asia. Japan and South Korea
can, by virtue of their alliance with the United States, be seen to
occupy positions in a third layer of regional major powers, while India
is ranked next on the strength of its new strategic relationship with
Washington. North Korea sits outside the hierarchic order but affects it
due to its military prowess and nuclear weapons capability. Apart from
making greater sense of recent history, conceiving of the US\' role in
East Asia as the dominant state in the regional hierarchy helps to
clarify three critical puzzles in the contemporary international and
East Asian security landscape. First, it contributes to explaining the
lack of sustained challenges to American global preponderance after the
end of the Cold War. [[Three]{.mark} of the key potential global
[challengers to]{.mark} US [unipolarity originate in Asia]{.mark}
(China, India, and Japan), and [their support]{.mark} for or
acquiescence to, US dominance have [helped to stabilize]{.mark} its
[global leadership]{.mark}. [Through]{.mark} its [dominance]{.mark} of
the Asian regional hierarchy[, the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [has been
able to [neutralize]{.mark} the potential [threats]{.mark} to its
position from Japan [via an alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}, from India by
gradually identifying and pursuing mutual commercial and strategic
interests, [and [from China by encircling and deterring it with allied
and friendly states that support America]{.mark}n
preponderance.]{.underline} Secondly, [recognizing US hierarchical
preponderance further explains contemporary under-balancing in Asia,
both against a rising China, and against incumbent American
power.]{.underline} I have argued that one defining characteristic of a
hierarchical system is voluntary subordination of lesser states to the
dominant state, and that this goes beyond rationalistic bandwagoning
because it is manifested in a social contract that comprises the related
processes of hierarchical assurance and hierarchical deference.
Critically, [successful and sustainable hierarchical assurance and
deference helps to explain why Japan is not yet a 'normal'
country.]{.underline} Japan has experienced significant impetus to
revise and expand the remit of its security forces in the last 15 years.
Yet, these pressures continue to be insufficient to prompt a wholesale
revision of its constitution and its remilitarization. The reason is
that [the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[extends its security umbrella over Japan]{.underline} through their
alliance, [which has led Tokyo not only to perceive no threat from US
dominance, but has in fact helped to forge a security community between
them]{.underline} (Nau, 2003). [Adjustments in burden sharing in this
alliance]{.underline} since the 1990s [have arisen]{.underline} not from
greater independent Japanese strategic activism, but rather [from
periods of strategic uncertainty and crises for Japan when it appeared
that American hierarchical assurance, along with US\' position at the
top of the regional hierarchy, was in question.]{.underline} Thus, [the
[Japanese priority]{.mark} in taking on more responsibility for regional
security [has been to improve]{.mark} its ability to facilitate the
[US\' central position]{.mark}, rather than to challenge
it.]{.underline}13 In the face of the security threats from North Korea
and China, Tokyo\'s continued reliance on the security pact with the
United States is rational. While there remains debate about Japan\'s
re-militarization and the growing clout of nationalist 'hawks' in Tokyo,
for regional and domestic political reasons, a sustained 'normalization'
process cannot take place outside of the restraining framework of the
United States--Japan alliance (Samuels, 2007; Pyle, 2007).
[[Abandoning]{.mark} the [alliance will entail Japan]{.mark} making a
conscience choice not only to remove itself from the US-led hierarchy,
but also [to challenge the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [dominance
[directly]{.mark}.]{.underline} The United States--ROK alliance may be
understood in a similar way, although South Korea faces different sets
of constraints because of its strategic priorities related to North
Korea. As J.J. Suh argues, in spite of diminishing North Korean
capabilities, which render the US security umbrella less critical, the
alliance endures because of mutual identification -- in South Korea, the
image of the US as 'the only conceivable protector against aggression
from the North,' and in the United States, an image of itself as
protector of an allied nation now vulnerable to an 'evil' state
suspected of transferring weapons of mass destruction to terrorist
networks (Suh, 2004). Kang, in contrast, emphasizes how South Korea has
become less enthusiastic about its ties with the United States -- as
indicated by domestic protests and the rejection of TMD -- and points
out that Seoul is not arming against a potential land invasion from
China but rather maritime threats (Kang, 2003, pp.79--80). These
observations are valid, but they can be explained by hierarchical
deference toward the United States, rather than China. The ROK\'s
military orientation reflects its identification with and dependence on
the United States and its adoption of US\' strategic aims. In spite of
its primary concern with the North Korean threat, Seoul\'s formal
strategic orientation is toward maritime threats, in line with
Washington\'s regional strategy. Furthermore, recent South Korean
Defense White Papers habitually cited a remilitarized Japan as a key
threat. The best means of coping with such a threat would be continued
reliance on the US security umbrella and on Washington\'s ability to
restrain Japanese remilitarization (Eberstadt et al., 2007). Thus, while
the United States--ROK bilateral relationship is not always easy, its
durability is based on South Korea\'s fundamental acceptance of the
United States as the region\'s primary state and reliance on it to
defend and keep regional order. It also does not rule out Seoul and
other US allies conducting business and engaging diplomatically with
China. India has increasingly adopted a similar strategy vis-à-vis China
in recent years. Given its history of territorial and political disputes
with China and its contemporary economic resurgence, India is seen as
the key potential power balancer to a growing China. Yet, India has
sought to negotiate settlements about border disputes with China, and
has moved significantly toward developing closer strategic relations
with the United States. Apart from invigorated defense cooperation in
the form of military exchange programs and joint exercises, the key
breakthrough was the agreement signed in July 2005 which facilitates
renewed bilateral civilian nuclear cooperation (Mohan, 2007). Once
again, this is a key regional power that could have balanced more
directly and independently against China, but has rather chosen to align
itself or bandwagon with the primary power, the United States, partly
because of significant bilateral gains, but fundamentally in order to
support the latter\'s regional order-managing function. Recognizing a
regional hierarchy and seeing that the lower layers of this hierarchy
have become more active since the mid-1970s also allows us to understand
why there has been no outright balancing of China by regional states
since the 1990s. On the one hand, the US position at the top of the
hierarchy has been revived since the mid-1990s, meaning that deterrence
against potential Chinese aggression is reliable and in place.14 On the
other hand, the aim of regional states is to try to consolidate China\'s
inclusion in the regional hierarchy at the level below that of the
United States, not to keep it down or to exclude it. East Asian states
recognize that they cannot, without great cost to themselves, contain
Chinese growth. But they hope to socialize China by enmeshing it in
peaceful regional norms and economic and security institutions. They
also know that they can also help to ensure that the capabilities gap
between China and the United States remains wide enough to deter a power
transition. Because this strategy requires persuading China about the
appropriateness of its position in the hierarchy and of the legitimacy
of the US position, all East Asian states engage significantly with
China, with the small Southeast Asian states refusing openly to 'choose
sides' between the United States and China. Yet, hierarchical deference
continues to explain why regional institutions such as the ASEAN
Regional Forum, ASEAN + 3, and East Asian Summit have made limited
progress. While the United State has made room for regional multilateral
institutions after the end of the Cold War, its hierarchical
preponderance also constitutes the regional order to the extent that it
cannot comfortably be excluded from any substantive strategic
developments. On the part of some lesser states (particularly Japan and
Singapore), hierarchical deference is manifested in inclusionary
impulses (or at least impulses not to exclude the United States or US
proxies) in regional institutions, such as the East Asia Summit in
December 2005. Disagreement on this issue with others, including China
and Malaysia, has stymied potential progress in these regional
institutions (Malik, 2006). Finally, conceiving of a US-led East Asian
hierarchy amplifies our understanding of how and why the United
States--China relationship is now the key to regional order. The vital
nature of the Sino-American relationship stems from these two states\'
structural positions. As discussed earlier, China is the primary
second-tier power in the regional hierarchy. However, as Chinese power
grows and Chinese activism spreads beyond Asia, the United States is
less and less able to see China as merely a regional power -- witness
the growing concerns about Chinese investment and aid in certain African
countries. This causes a disjuncture between US global interests and US
regional interests. Regional attempts to engage and socialize China are
aimed at mediating its intentions. This process, however, cannot stem
Chinese growth, which forms the material basis of US threat perceptions.
Apprehensions about the growth of China\'s power culminates in US fears
about the region being 'lost' to China, echoing Cold War concerns that
transcribed regional defeats into systemic setbacks.15 On the other
hand, the US security strategy post-Cold War and post-9/11 have regional
manifestations that disadvantage China. The strengthening of US
alliances with Japan and Australia; and the deployment of US troops to
Central, South, and Southeast Asia all cause China to fear a
consolidation of US global hegemony that will first threaten Chinese
national security in the regional context and then stymie China\'s
global reach. Thus, the key determinants of the East Asian security
order relate to two core questions: (i) Can the US be persuaded that
China can act as a reliable 'regional stakeholder' that will help to
buttress regional stability and US global security aims;16 and (ii) can
China be convinced that the United States has neither territorial
ambitions in Asia nor the desire to encircle China, but will help to
promote Chinese development and stability as part of its global security
strategy? (Wang, 2005). But, these questions cannot be asked in the
abstract, outside the context of negotiation about their relative
positions in the regional and global hierarchies. One urgent question
for further investigation is how the process of assurance and deference
operate at the topmost levels of a hierarchy? When we have two great
powers of unequal strength but contesting claims and a closing
capabilities gap in the same regional hierarchy, how much scope for
negotiation is there, before a reversion to balancing dynamics? This is
the main structural dilemma: as long as the United States does not give
up its primary position in the Asian regional hierarchy, China is very
unlikely to act in a way that will provide comforting answers to the two
questions. Yet, [the East Asian regional order]{.underline} has been and
still [is constituted by [US hegemony]{.mark}, and to [change]{.mark}
that [could]{.mark} be extremely disruptive and may [lead to]{.mark}
regional [actors acting in highly destabilizing ways]{.mark}. **Rapid
[Japanese remilitarization]{.mark}, armed [conflict across the Taiwan
Straits, Indian nuclear brinksmanship]{.mark} directed toward Pakistan,
[or a highly destabilized Korean peninsula are all]{.mark} illustrative
of [potential]{.mark} regional disruptions.**]{.underline} 5. Conclusion
To construct a coherent account of East Asia\'s evolving security order,
I have suggested that [the]{.underline} [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is]{.mark} the [central]{.mark} force
[in]{.mark} constituting [regional stability]{.mark} and
order.]{.underline} The major patterns of equilibrium and turbulence in
the region since 1945 can be explained by the relative stability of the
US position at the top of the regional hierarchy, with [periods of
greatest insecurity being correlated with greatest uncertainty over the
American commitment to managing regional order.]{.underline}
Furthermore, relationships of hierarchical assurance and hierarchical
deference explain the unusual character of regional order in the
post-Cold War era. However, the greatest contemporary challenge to East
Asian order is the potential conflict between China and the United
States over rank ordering in the regional hierarchy, a contest made more
potent because of the inter-twining of regional and global security
concerns. Ultimately, though, investigating such questions of
positionality requires conceptual lenses that go beyond basic material
factors because it entails social and normative questions. How can China
be brought more into a leadership position, while being persuaded to buy
into shared strategic interests and constrain its own in ways that its
vision of regional and global security may eventually be reconciled with
that of the United States and other regional players? How can Washington
be persuaded that its central position in the hierarchy must be
ultimately shared in ways yet to be determined? [The [future of the East
Asian security]{.mark} order is [tightly bound up with the durability
of]{.mark} the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates\'
[global [leadership]{.mark} and regional domination. At the regional
level, the main scenarios of disruption are an outright Chinese
challenge to US leadership, or the defection of key US allies,
particularly Japan.]{.underline} Recent history suggests, and the
preceding analysis has shown, that challenges to or [[defections]{.mark}
from US leadership [will come at junctures where it appears that the US
commitment to the region is in doubt,]{.mark} which in turn destabilizes
the hierarchical order.]{.underline} At the global level, American
geopolitical over-extension will be the key cause of change. This is the
one factor that could lead to both greater regional and global
turbulence, if only by the attendant strategic uncertainly triggering
off regional challenges or defections. However, it is notoriously
difficult to gauge thresholds of over-extension. More positively, East
Asia is a region that has adjusted to previous periods of uncertainty
about US primacy. Arguably, the regional consensus over the United
States as primary state in a system of benign hierarchy could
accommodate a shifting of the strategic burden to US allies like Japan
and Australia as a means of systemic preservation. The alternatives that
could surface as a result of not doing so would appear to be much worse.

The [[liberal world order]{.underline}]{.mark} that was created in the
aftermath of the Second World War [is]{.underline} today [[being
challenged]{.mark} by]{.underline} a [variety of forces]{.underline} ---
by powerful [authoritarian governments and anti-liberal fundamentalist
movements]{.underline}, as well as by long-term shifts in the global
economy. **[[Great power competition has
returned]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[In]{.underline}
**[Europe]{.underline}**]{.mark}, **[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** has
[**[launched]{.mark} the first [cross-border invasion]{.mark}**
of]{.underline} a [neighboring country]{.underline} since World War II.
[[In]{.underline}]{.mark} East **[[Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[China]{.mark} is [expanding]{.mark} its reach as a [military
power]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [seeking]{.underline} both economic and
strategic [hegemony at the risk of [destabilizing]{.mark} that critical
[region]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[In]{.mark} the [Middle East]{.mark},
[Iran]{.mark} is [expanding]{.mark} its [influence]{.mark} and Islamic
[jihadists]{.mark} have [gained control of]{.mark} more
[territory]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In the face of this turmoil, many
Americans have come to doubt whether there is anything the United States
can do or should do in response. Many assume either that it doesn't
matter very much what happens beyond America's shores or that the United
States no longer has the wisdom or capacity to shape events and prevent
others from doing what they please. Only seven years ago, [[pundits were
talking of]{.mark} a "[post-American world]{.mark}," [with]{.mark} a
[declining U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} a remarkable
"[rise of the rest]{.mark}."]{.underline} These days, however, [that
[prognosis appears to have been]{.mark} at best
**[premature]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Only seven years ago, pundits were
talking of a "post-American world," with a declining United States and a
remarkable "rise of the rest." These days, however, that prognosis
appears to have been at best premature. **[[America]{.mark} has
[substantially recovered from]{.mark} the]{.underline}** Great
**[[Recession]{.underline}]{.mark}**, while [the **once-heralded "[rise
of the rest]{.mark}" has [stalled]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Many around
the world who once decried American overseas involvement as "hegemonic"
now seek greater American engagement in international
affairs.]{.underline} Widespread Support for US Actions Against ISIS Pew
Research Center: Support for U.S. Actions against ISIS [[Among]{.mark}
the]{.underline} American [[public]{.underline}]{.mark}, too, **[there
[are]{.mark} signs of [greater receptivity to]{.mark} a [more active
American]{.mark} global [role]{.mark}]{.underline}**. What is missing
for most Americans, however, is a sense of strategy and purpose in
American foreign policy. During the Cold War, fear of the Soviet Union
and international communism did not always produce agreement on policy
but did provide an answer, for most, as to why the United States needed
to play an international role and what that role should be. Today, our
[political leaders need to remind Americans that our [fundamental
interests are]{.mark} still [best served by upholding the world
order]{.mark} --- economic, political, and strategic]{.underline} ---
that was established at the end of the Second World War and that was
further strengthened and entrenched by the revolutions of 1989.
[Americans need to recognize their nation's central role in maintaining
the present international order and muster the will to use their still
formidable power and influence to support that order against its
inevitable challengers]{.underline}. Supporting Democracy is a Matter of
National Security What will this require? Above all, [it means working
to shore up all]{.underline} three pillars -- politics, economics,
[security]{.underline} --- of what has [made the American-led world
order so remarkable]{.underline}. There is a tendency to separate
politics, economics, and security --- "ideals" from "interests," support
for democracy from defense of security --- but in the present world
order they have all been related. Start with the reality that a world
order that supports freedom will only be supported by free nations.
[Supporting democracy]{.underline} is not just a matter of keeping faith
with our own values. It [is a matter of national security]{.underline}.
Americans and other free peoples who benefit from and support the
present world order therefore have an interest in supporting democracy
where it exists and in pressing for greater democratic reforms in the
world's authoritarian nations, including the two great power
autocracies. Supporting democracy is not just a matter of keeping faith
with our own values. It is a matter of national security. In their
economic policies, [[America]{.mark}ns]{.underline} need to [continue
promoting and **[strengthen]{.mark}ing**]{.underline} the
**[international [free trade]{.mark} and free market
regime]{.underline}**. This, of course, means setting their own economy
back on a course of sustainable growth. It means doing a better job of
educating and training Americans to compete with others in an
increasingly competitive international economy. It means providing a
healthy environment for technological innovation. But it also [[means
**resisting protectionist temptations**]{.mark} **and [using American
influence]{.mark}**]{.underline}, along with other free-trading nations,
[[to push back]{.mark} against some of the tendencies of state
capitalism in China and elsewhere]{.underline}. Gaining congressional
approval of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, and then moving to
agreement on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with
Europe, are critical, and not only for their economic benefits. They
also are a critical step in knitting the democratic world more closely
together. But it also means resisting protectionist temptations and
using American influence, along with other free-trading nations, to push
back against some of the tendencies of state capitalism in China and
elsewhere. In Asia, especially, this is more much than a trade issue.
Although the United States stands to benefit from the agreement, it is,
above all, a strategic issue. [The United States and China are locked in
a competition across the spectrum of power and influence.]{.underline}
Militarily, **[the [Chinese seek to deny American access to]{.mark} the
[region]{.mark} and [hope]{.mark} thereby [to divide]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [from]{.mark} its
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Economically, China would like to turn
Asia into a region of Chinese hegemony, where every key trade
relationship is with Beijing. In such a world, the United States is a
net loser --- providing costly security to allies but not much else,
while China reaps the economic rewards and grabs the hearts and minds,
and pocketbooks, of regional players. [Finally, there is the matter of
American hard power]{.underline}. What has been true since the time of
Rome remains true today: [**[there can be no world order]{.mark}
[without power]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} preserve it, to shape its norms,
uphold its institutions, defend the sinews of its economic system, and
**[keep the peace]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Military power]{.mark} can
be abused, wielded unwisely and ineffectively]{.underline}. It can be
deployed to answer problems that it cannot answer or that have no
answer. [But]{.underline} [it **[is]{.mark}**]{.underline} also
**[[essential]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [No nation]{.underline} or group
of nations [that renounced power could expect to maintain any kind of
world order. [If]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [begins to
look]{.mark} like a [less reliable]{.mark} [defender]{.mark} of the
present order, that **[order will]{.mark} begin to
[unravel]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It remains true today as it has since
the Second World War that **[[only]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [has]{.mark} the [capacity and]{.mark} the unique
[geographical advantages to provide]{.mark} [global
security]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[[There can be no stable balance of
power in Europe or Asia without]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}**. And while we can talk about
[[soft]{.mark} power [and smart power]{.mark}]{.underline}, they [have
been and [always will be of **limited value**]{.mark} [when
confronting]{.mark} raw [military]{.mark} power]{.underline}. Despite
all of the loose talk of American decline, [it is in the military realm
where U.S. advantages remain clearest]{.underline}. Even in other great
power's backyards, [the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [retains]{.mark}
the [capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}, along with its powerful allies, [[to
deter challenges to]{.mark} the [security]{.mark} order]{.underline}.
But [[without]{.mark} a [U.S. willingness to]{.mark} play the role of
providing [balance]{.mark} in far-flung regions of the world, **the
[system will buckle under]{.mark} the unrestrained [military]{.mark}
[competition of regional powers]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Without a U.S.
willingness to play the role of providing balance in far-flung regions
of the world, the system will buckle under the unrestrained military
competition of regional powers. Today, as a result of the Budget Control
Act and a general unwillingness to spend adequately on defense,
America's ability to play this vital role is coming increasingly under
question. Current defense spending has created a readiness crisis within
the armed forces. Only a handful of Army brigades are available for use
in a crisis. The army is about to be forced to cut 40,000 soldiers from
its active force. There are too few ships to provide a U.S. presence in
the multiple hotspots that have sprouted up around the world. As the
bipartisan, congressionally-mandated National Defense Panel has argued,
[the [U.S. military must be able to **deter or stop aggression**]{.mark}
in multiple theaters]{.underline}, not just one, even when engaged in a
large-scale war. [It [needs to]{.mark} be able to **[fight
ISIS]{.mark}** and **[deter Iran]{.mark}** in the Middle East, **[deter
Russia]{.mark}** in Europe and Syria, and in Asia **deter [No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rea** [and **maintain stability in**]{.mark} **the [face
of]{.mark} a [rising China]{.mark}**. Consider the threat]{.underline}
now [posed by Iran]{.underline}. Whatever one thinks about the
recently-concluded nuclear deal, [any serious [strategy aimed at
resisting Iranian domination]{.mark} also [requires confronting Iran
on]{.mark} the several fronts of [the]{.mark} Middle East
[battlefield]{.mark}. In Syria, it requires a determined policy to
remove Iran's close ally]{.underline}, Basher al-Assad, [[using U.S. air
power]{.mark} to provide cover for civilians and creating a safe zone
for Syrians willing to fight]{.underline}. [In Iraq, it
[requires]{.mark} using [American forces to]{.mark} push back and
[destroy]{.mark} the forces of [the Islamic State]{.mark} so that we do
not have to rely]{.underline}, de facto, [on Iranian power]{.underline}
to do the job. Overall, [it requires a greater U.S. military
commitment]{.underline} to the region, a reversal of both the perceived
and the real withdrawal of American power. And therefore it requires a
reversal of the downward trend in U.S. defense spending, which has made
it harder for the military even to think about addressing these
challenges, should it be called upon to do so. The challenge we face
today is to decide whether this liberal world order is worth defending
and whether the United States is still willing to play the role of its
principal champion. The answer to both questions ought to be "yes," but
[**[it will require]{.mark} a renewal of [American leadership]{.mark} in
the international system**, economically, politically, [and]{.mark}
strategically]{.underline}. [It will also require a **[renewed
understanding of how important]{.mark} and unique [the]{.mark} present
[liberal]{.mark} world [order is]{.mark}**, both for Americans and for
peoples all across the globe]{.underline}. The simple fact is that for
all the difficulties and suffering of the past 70 years, the period
since the end of World War II has been unique in the history of the
human race. The period since the end of World War II has been unique in
the history of the human race. Democratic government, once rare, has
spread to over 100 nations around the world, on every continent, for
peoples of all races and religions. [There has been an unprecedented
growth in prosperity]{.underline}. [Billions have been lifted out of
poverty]{.underline}. Democratic government, once rare, has spread to
over 100 nations around the world, on every continent, for peoples of
all races and religions. Although the period has been marked by war,
peace among the great powers has been preserved. There has been no
recurrence of the two devastating world wars of the first half of the
20th century. This world order has been a boon for billions around the
world, but it has also served American interests. [[Any]{.mark} [other
world order]{.mark}, one [in which the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[had to **cede power**]{.mark} **and influence to China and
Russia**]{.underline}, or what [[is]{.mark} more likely]{.underline},
**[[a descent into disorder]{.underline}]{.mark}**, is unlikely to serve
Americans' interests as well.

The Argument

This paper views the international system with geographical and
geopolitical eyes. For this reason, it uses geographical facts as
factors in analyzing the current global system and its future prospects.
The argument this paper will promote is that the [U.S. [physical
location]{.mark} and geopolitical position]{.underline} are the
cornerstones of its foreign policy and [[serve as a \"safety
net\"]{.mark} from foreign]{.underline} powers\' [assaults]{.underline}
(not perfect, obviously, as became painfully clear on September 11,
2001). The [U.S., unlike any other]{.underline} great or
[superpower]{.underline} -- now or anytime -- [can decide
whether]{.underline} or not and to what extent [will it be involved in
international affairs]{.underline}. Isolationism was a practical policy
(regardless of its success) for approximately twenty years since the end
of World War I until Pearl Harbor (1941). Even though since the end of
World War II the United States is conducting an opposite strategy,
theoretically and hypothetically it can be resumed, perhaps not to the
extent it was in the 1920s-1930s, but a sort of isolationism is
possible. No other country can afford such a policy because all other
powers are on the same continent and cannot disregard one another.

Moreover, the [[U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} is still -- and [[will
remain]{.mark} in the foreseeable future -- [the naval
superpower]{.mark} with]{.underline} the most powerful navy that has the
[best power-projection capabilities]{.underline}. It can afford to leave
the continent and become an offshore balancer. [True, it will lose
some]{.underline} of its [influence, but it can preserve]{.underline}
its [power on the sea and project it]{.underline} restrictedly [whenever
needed]{.underline}. So, very briefly, the [[U.S. has]{.mark} a much
wider room for maneuver than]{.underline} is [presumed, and with [the
most powerful military with no parallel]{.mark} in the foreseeable
future]{.underline}, the U.S. still has a wide spectrum of policies it
can use, [[hence]{.mark} it is in [the best position for]{.mark} the
[coming]{.mark} hegemonic [competition]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Literature Review

It is important to note that most of the literature is American, which
is expected and logical, but also somewhat problematic due to obvious
biases. One of these is the obsession with China, as it is the focus of
most studies but seems more frightening than in reality. The obsession
with China leaves out analyses of the rise of other great powers,
therefore the literature cannot really establish that the alternative to
unipolarity is multipolarity. The studies that focus on China seem to
implement that the next system will be bipolar. To its credit, though,
it seems that [there is no power]{.underline} that is [emerging as much
as China]{.underline} does, hence it is correct to focus on it. But
then, will other powers be entitled to be regarded as poles? This is an
extra-regional question with significant implications to East Asia in a
global context. The literature regarding the structure of the
international system can be divided into two major types:

A. By the source of threat to the U.S. primacy (future structure): 1.
The China alarmists (bipolarity); 2. The BRICS are emerging
(multipolarity); 3. Who cares? The American advance is too large to
catch up (unipolarity).

B. By the effect on U.S. behavior: 1. Fight to preserve primacy --
preemption or prevention; 2. Get used to it -- selective engagement or
offshore balancing.

Within the Realist paradigm there are two competing theories that
prescribe conflicting advice that is based on contradictory readings of
reality.12 Whereas offensive realism suggests securing material power
that will guarantee a given country\'s security, and securing regional
and global primacy even by force,13 defensive realism suggests
possessing sufficient material power and prefers some sort of power
sharing to enhance mutual trust among the great powers, which enhances
-- they believe -- the security of each power.14 In the American case,
defensive realism suggests offshore balancing or selective engagement,
while offensive realism would prefer domination and engagement with
potential rivals. This does not mean that there cannot be agreement
among all realists concerning American actions, such as the consensus
among many realists that the war against Iraq in 2003 was unnecessary
and even damaging.15 The disagreements grow and are much more acute
regarding other great powers. How should the U.S. treat China and other
emerging or reemerging powers? Should they be engaged? Should the U.S.
prevent the foreseen competition by striking first, or should the U.S.
allow them to emerge as regional hegemons and then divide the world into
spheres of influence with them?

The question everyone asks is whether or not American hegemony is over
or when will it happen. Ian Clark suggests that the term hegemony is
misused, and prefers questioning the future of American primacy.16 This
paper will follow Clark in terminology and substance.

Schweller and Pu say that \"If a great transformation is coming, it is
not one that heralds a radically altered world politics based on
legalism, constitutionalism, or global civic activism. Rather, it is a
structural transformation from unipolarity to multipolarity that most
realists believe promises a return to the familiar history of great
powers struggling for power and prestige.\"17 [There definitely seems to
be [a transition]{.mark}, but is it [to multipolarity]{.mark} or
bipolarity]{.underline}, and in any case -- will it resemble past
experiences? [This [is highly uncertain]{.mark}. The power that the U.S.
had obtained]{.underline} in the last several decades [places it in a
**different category** than any other great power in the foreseeable
future, therefore **[even if the U.S. is less dominant]{.mark}**
compared to other great powers, [it is **far fetching** to argue]{.mark}
for [similar status]{.mark} as in any previous system]{.underline}. This
is not to say that later in the future [such a system]{.underline} might
emerge, but [in the near future it is **unlikely**]{.underline}.18

Robert Art argued in 2010 that the [[U.S. is]{.mark} the [most
powerful]{.mark} state [in]{.mark} the world in [economic and military
assets and will remain]{.mark} the most powerful military power [\"for
some time]{.mark} to come]{.underline},\" but inevitably its edge
relative to other great powers will diminish in the coming decades.
China is the greatest potential rival, provided that its economy will
continue to grow in the coming two decades as it did in the last two
decades (then it will surpass the U.S. in its GDP, but not in its GDP
per capita). For now, [[China]{.mark} had]{.underline} already [[changed
the balance]{.mark} of power]{.underline} in East Asia. It is already
the region\'s dominant military land power. Art assesses that if China
invests in its military forces for several decades, and is determined to
project naval and air power, it will be able to deploy a naval force
that \"could contest the American supremacy at sea in East Asia.\"19
[Some conflict seems inevitable]{.underline}, including arms race, [[but
there can be **more cooperation** than]{.mark} is [assumed]{.mark} by
most scholars]{.underline}.

Art correctly argues that [as long as China\'s]{.underline} emerging
[hegemony]{.underline} in East Asia [does not include Japan and the U.S.
maintains strongholds in]{.underline} the region ([Singapore, the
Philippines and Indonesia), the]{.underline} geopolitical [threat from
China will not be of similar extent as that of the Soviet Union. China
cannot jeopardize the global balance of power]{.underline} as long as
Europe, the Persian Gulf, India, Japan and Russia are independent or
under U.S. influence.20 China cannot threaten the U.S. as the Soviet
Union did due to its relative size. His conclusion: be smart; let China
grow but draw a line in the sand, accept that it is growing but make
sure China knows the U.S. is stronger.

This seems as good advice, but one need only to see China\'s increasing
defense budget to understand why apparently following it is a difficult
job. China had increased the defense budget by 11.2% in 2012, following
two decades of annual two-figure percents increases (since 1989, except
for 2009 -- only 7.5%).21 There are always questions on the purpose of
this steady increase: in preparation for a global conflict with the U.S.
over resources and political interests (i.e., preparing China to become
a rival pole); a regional conflict with any of its neighbors -- and
China indeed has issues with all of them, be it territorial, historical,
economic, etc.; or domestic, preparing to crush separatists or rebels.

In 2001, Mearsheimer wrote that \"American policy \[on China\] has
sought to integrate China into the world economy and facilitate its
rapid economic development, so that it becomes wealthy and, one would
hope, content with its present position in the international system.
This U.S. policy is misguided. A wealthy China would not be a status quo
power but an aggressive state determined to achieve regional
hegemony.... Although it is certainly in China\'s interest to be the
hegemon in Northeast Asia, it is clearly not in America\'s interest to
have that happen.... It is not too late for the United States to reverse
course and do what it can to slow the rise of China.\"22

A decade after Mearsheimer\'s warning, it seems that he was partly
correct and partly wrong. A steadily increasing share of China\'s wealth
is turned into military power, and recently, it is reported, Chinese
strategists apparently began calling their government to fit China\'s
foreign policy to its capabilities, which means replacing the \"peaceful
rise\" and the \"low profile policy\" with a much more ambitious
policy.23 But China\'s economic rise will first need to finance its
aging population. Nevertheless, China\'s goals are unclear to American
and western analysts and policymakers, although there are official
Chinese documents that allow assessing their true aims.24

It is interesting to follow China\'s rise to hegemony in East Asia and
the reaction of its neighbors. They were expected to act to balance
China, but according to Chan\'s study, they don\'t. The defense burden
is not rising and trade with China is increasing -- contrary to the
theoretical expectations.25 This can indicate either that China
succeeded in splitting among its regional rivals, or that the U.S. is no
longer functioning as a regional hegemon, therefore they have no one to
turn to against China.

Michael Beckley provides a detailed analysis of the rise of China and of
the U.S. decline or non-decline.26 Most declinists, as Beckley labels
them, argue that the U.S. is in economic decline, not in military
decline.27 This is an important point -- in military terms the U.S. is
still the sole superpower, and it is hard to see circumstances under
which the U.S. would lose this status. The [American [spending on
defense is still higher than]{.mark}]{.underline} that of
[[all]{.underline}]{.mark} its [potential [rivals combined]{.mark},
and]{.underline} even if the tipping point is coming closer and China
will surpass the U.S. in defense expenditure, [it will take many years
for China to close the gap -- qualitative and quantitative.]{.underline}
Unlike money, [military assets do not vanish]{.underline} (it is hard to
imagine an aircraft carrier simply disappear or being given or sold to
China). Therefore, [[even if]{.underline}]{.mark} the U.S.
[[expenditure]{.underline}]{.mark} on defense [[decreases, it does not
affect]{.underline}]{.mark} American military
[[primacy]{.underline}]{.mark}, at least [in the short run]{.underline}.
Nevertheless, the bond between economy and military affairs is very
strong. For instance, in April 2012 senior U.S. officials admitted that
there is no budget to strike Syria, therefore the solution of the
turmoil would have to be diplomatic.28

Mario Carranza mentions that those who argue that the U.S. **[[hegemony
is not in decline]{.underline}]{.mark}** claim that [neither China nor
Europe can shape events]{.underline} on the basis of their material
power, but he also argues that they underestimate China\'s (and to
lesser extent, Europe\'s) ability to take control over markets in the
Global South (South America and South Asia), and mentions that China
increased dramatically its economic relations with key South American
countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.29

Daniel Drezner presents the economic aspect of China\'s rise, and
focuses on its new status as the U.S.\'s greatest debt holder.30 This
issue is political no less and probably more than economic. But part of
being proof that in the age of globalization that the U.S. promoted so
powerfully it lost the economic primacy (and there are counterarguments
on this), does it make a real difference? After all, had the U.S. lost
any military asset due to its economic decline? Had any such asset been
sold to China? Of course not. Hence, the balance in hard power is quite
clear: China possesses the major part of American dollars in the world
and is America\'s largest creditor and debt holder, but the U.S. had not
lost any of its military power, and it is still superior to any other
power, especially China.

Hart and Jones assert that [the U.S. [economy is]{.mark} still [three
times larger than]{.mark} the [Chinese]{.mark}]{.underline} one.31 But
still, there is change in the degree of influence each power has in the
system. \"China, for instance, has long been a 'sovereignty hawk',
generally opposing the notion that interventions for humanitarian
purposes are legitimate. Its model of authoritarian capitalism has also
increasingly become an ideological export, challenging the United
States' liberal model.\"32 Russia is perhaps misplaced in the list of
emerging powers. Its economic data are not really improving and its
population is declining annually by 4%, and with this rate it might drop
to less than 120 million by 2050 compared to 140 million today.33

This sample of [scholarly literature]{.underline} of the last decade
[demonstrates]{.underline} the [confusion regarding the current
situation]{.underline}, although in recent years it is clearer that
there is a significant decline in American economic primacy. However,
[[it seems **clear to all**]{.mark} that [the U.S.]{.mark} still [holds
**military primacy** and]{.mark}]{.underline} in this aspect primacy
[[does not seem]{.mark} to be [jeopardized for **many years**]{.mark}
**to come**]{.underline}.34

Though on the job for only about dozen weeks, the new administration
handled a lot of action on multiple fronts quite deftly. [At the core of
Trump's view of the world are his views on the global liberal order.
[**Trump** **is no isolationist**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Trump

that [poses no threat to]{.mark} friends and
[allies]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[Copied](http://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/trump-has-foreign-policy-strategy)
For two weeks, the White House has unleashed a foreign-policy
blitzkrieg, and Washington's chattering classes are shocked and, if not
awed, at least perplexed. CNN calls Trump's actions [a
"u-turn."](http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/12/politics/trump-russia-china-nato-syria/)
Bloomberg opts for the more mathematical "180 degree turn," while the
*Washington Post* [goes with
"flipflop."](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-12-27/trump-s-180-degree-turn-on-china-policy)
Meanwhile, pundits switched from decrying the president as an
isolationist [to lambasting
him](https://consortiumnews.com/2017/04/10/neocons-have-trump-on-his-knees/)
as a tool of the neocons. Amid all the relabeling, explanations of [an
"emerging Trump
Doctrine"](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/08/us/politics/trump-doctrine-foreign-policy.html)
have proliferated faster than North Korea's nuclear arsenal. Here's my
take on what's going on: • Yes, [[there is a method to Trump's
"madness.]{.mark}"]{.underline} • No, there has been no big change in
Trump's strategy. [The [actions that flustered
those]{.mark}]{.underline} who thought they had pigeon-holed Donald
Trump [simply [reflect]{.mark} the [impulses **that have driven the
direction**]{.mark} **of this presidency [since before]{.mark} the
[convention]{.mark} in Cleveland**]{.underline}**. At the Center of the
Storm** [Where is the [head]{.mark} and heart [of]{.mark} the
president's national-[security team]{.mark}?]{.underline} Ask that
question a year ago, and the answer would have been simple: General Mike
Flynn, Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Senator Jeff Sessions. Today, Flynn is
gone. Giuliani never went in. Sessions is still a crucial voice in the
administration, but his duties as Attorney General deal only partially
with foreign policy and national-security matters. The new team centers
round Jim [[Mattis at]{.mark} the [Defense]{.mark}
Department]{.underline}, Rex [[Tillerson]{.underline}]{.mark} at the
State Department, John [[Kelly]{.underline}]{.mark} at the Department of
Homeland Security [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} H. R. [[McMaster]{.mark} in
the West Wing---ably assisted by Nikki Haley at the United
Nations.]{.underline} Trump barely knew these people before the
election. [**[There is little question]{.mark}** that the new
**[team's]{.mark}**]{.underline} character and [[**competence**
**affected**]{.mark} the **[White House response]{.mark}** to the recent
string of high profile events]{.underline} and activities---from
presidential meetings with Egypt and China and Tillerson's tête-à-tête
with Putin, to the ominous developments in Syria and North Korea. Though
on the job for only about dozen weeks, [the new administration handled a
lot of [action]{.mark} on multiple fronts quite deftly. Much of that
[can be credited to]{.mark} the **maturity and [experience of
Trump's]{.mark} senior national-security [team]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
But how the administration responded was purely Trumpian---reflecting an
impulse that transcends the makeup of his foreign team or other White
House advisors. **Decoding Trumpian Strategy** Since the early days of
the campaign, one thing has been clear: trying stitch together an
understanding of Trump's foreign and defense policy based on Trump's
tweets and other off-hand comments is a fool's errand. [That has not
changed](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/dont-fear-trumps-tweets-19398)
since the Donald took over the Oval Office. That is not to say that none
of Trump's rhetoric matters. He has given some serious speeches and
commentary. But pundits err when they give every presidential utterance
equal merit. [A joint address to
Congress](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/trump-will-make-good-his-promise-keep-the-country-free-safe-19634)
ought to carry a lot more weight than a 3 a.m. tweet about the
Terminator. But especially with this presidency, [one needs to **[focus
on]{.mark}** White House [**actions rather than words** to]{.mark} gain
a clearer [understandi]{.mark}ng of [where]{.mark} security and [foreign
policy is headed. Do that, and one sees emerging]{.mark} a foreign and
defense [policy]{.mark} **more conventional and [more
consistent]{.mark}**]{.underline} than what we got from Bush or Obama.
Still, a deeper dive is necessary to get at the root of Trump's take on
the world [and how it fits with recent
actions](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-most-shocking-thing-about-trump-so-far-how-boring-hes-19769)
like the tomahawk strikes in Syria and the armada steaming toward North
Korea. **[[I]{.mark} [briefed]{.mark}]{.underline}** Candidate
**[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** and his policy advisors
**[[during]{.mark} the [campaign]{.mark}]{.underline}**. I organized
workshops for the ambassadorial corps during the Cleveland Convention
and worked with the presidential team through the inauguration. Those
experiences let me observe how the policies from the future fledgling
administration were unfolding. Here are some observations that might be
helpful in understanding the Trumpian way. **[At the core of Trump's
view of the world are his views on the global liberal
order]{.underline}**. Trump is no isolationist. **[[He
recognizes]{.mark} that [America]{.mark} is a global power with global
interests and that it [can't]{.mark} promote and [protect]{.mark} those
[interests by sitting at home]{.mark} on its hands]{.underline}**.
Freedom of the commons, engaging and cooperating with like-minded
nations, [[working to blunt problems "over there" before they
get]{.mark} over [here]{.mark}---these are things every modern president
has pursued. **Trump is no different.**]{.underline} What distinguishes
Trump---and what marks a particularly sharp departure from Obama---is
his perception of what enabled post--World War America and the rest of
the free world to rise above the chaos of a half century of global
depression and open war. Obama and his ilk chalked it all up to
international infrastructure---the UN, IMF, World Bank, EU, et al. For
Trump, it was the sovereign states rather than the global bureaucracies
that made things better. The international superstructure has to stand
on a firm foundation---and the foundation is the sovereign state.
Without strong, vibrant, free and wealthy states, the whole thing
collapses like a Ponzi scheme. Trump is an arch nationalist in the
positive sense of the term. [America will never be
safe](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-fight-over-nationalism-about-get-messy-19266)
in the world if the world doesn't have an America that is free, safe and
prosperous. That belief is at the heart of Trump's policies designed to
spark an economic revival, rollback the administrative state and rebuild
the military. It lies at the core of his mantra: make America great
again. Even the strongest [America]{.underline}, however, [can't be a
global power without the willingness to act globally. And **[that\'s
where Trump\'s]{.mark} declaration of "[America First" comes
in]{.mark}.** What it means for foreign policy is that the president
will put the vital interests of the United States above the maintenance
of global institutions]{.underline}. That is **[[not an
abandonment]{.mark} of universal values]{.underline}**. Every American
president deals with the challenge of protecting interests and promoting
values. [Trump]{.underline} will focus on American interests and
American values, and that [poses no threat to friends and
allies]{.underline}. In many cases[, we share the same
values.]{.underline} In many cases, what\'s in [America\'s vital
interest is also in their interest---and best achieved through joint
partnership]{.underline}. Here is how those animating ideas are
currently manifesting themselves in Trump\'s strategy: A strategy
includes ends (what you are trying to accomplish), means (the
capabilities you will use to do that) and ways (how you are going to do
it). [The ends of Trump's strategy are **pretty clear**]{.underline}. In
both talk and action in the Trump world, it boils down to three parts of
the world: Europe, Asia and the Middle East. That makes sense. [Peace
and stability in these regions are vital to U.S. interest]{.underline}s
and are under assault. The United States wants all three parts of the
world to settle. It is unrealistic to think all the problems can be made
to disappear, but it is not unrealistic to significantly reduce the
potential for region-wide conflict.

[[The liberal]{.mark} world [order is **under
assault**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Polls suggest an American ambivalence
about upholding the rules-based global system. Populists are besieging
governing elites in the West while Russia works strategically to
destabilize European and American governments through propaganda and
proxies. [[A rising China wants to create a global system that is not
U.S.-centric]{.underline}]{.mark}, one [in which]{.underline} [smaller
powers defer to bigger ones]{.underline} and norms of democracy and rule
of law do not prevail. Meanwhile, the U.S. alliance system looks adrift
while competitors in China and Russia appear to be on the march. If it
holds, [[this trend could produce a **spheres-of-influence
world**]{.underline} --- [which]{.underline}]{.mark} many, including the
current presidents of the United States, [China]{.underline}, [and
Russia]{.underline}, [find **intuitively attractive**]{.underline}. But
were such an order to replace one based on global integration and
American leadership in the geopolitical cockpits of Europe and Asia, [it
[would]{.mark} only [engender **insecurity** and
**conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [In]{.underline}]{.mark} [a
[spheres]{.mark}-of-influence world]{.underline}, [[great powers order
their regions]{.underline}]{.mark}. The United States would go back to a
"Monroe Doctrine" version of grand strategy; [[Russia]{.mark} would
dominate]{.underline} the [former Soviet space]{.underline};
[[China]{.mark} would govern East Asia]{.underline}, [and [India]{.mark}
South Asia]{.underline}. The problem with this kind of order, however,
is several-fold. Too many [**[spheres overlap]{.underline}** [in ways
that would **generate conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark} [rather than clean
lines of responsibility]{.underline}. [[Japan would oppose Chinese
suzerainty]{.mark} in East Asia, including [by **developing nuclear
weapons**]{.mark}]{.underline}; [[India and China would **compete
vigorously**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in Southeast Asia]{.underline};
[[Russia and China would **contest**]{.mark} **the [resources]{.mark}**
and loyalties of Central Asia]{.underline}; [[Europe and Russia would
clash]{.mark} over primacy of Central and Eastern Europe]{.underline}.
[[The Middle East would be an]{.mark} even more likely [arena for **hot
war** between Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [and Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and
Turkey would contest regions]{.underline} also [claimed by
Russia]{.underline}, [Europe]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} possibly
[China]{.underline}. [Russia]{.underline}, like the Soviet Empire before
it, [would keep pushing west until it met enough hard power to stop
it]{.underline}. [[A spheres]{.mark} of influence
[world]{.mark}]{.underline} [[would]{.underline}]{.mark} also
**[[sharpen great power competition]{.underline}]{.mark}** [outside of
each region]{.underline}. [[Regional hegemony is a **springboard** for
global contestation]{.underline}. [China would be more likely to
challenge the U]{.underline}]{.mark}[nited [S]{.mark}tates out-of-area
if it had subdued **strategic competition**]{.underline} in its own
region. [Russia]{.underline}, like the Soviet Empire before it, [would
keep pushing west until it met enough hard power to stop
it]{.underline}. (The fact that Russian troops marched through Paris
during the Napoleonic Wars demonstrates that the limits of Russian power
need not be confined to the former Warsaw Pact). American leaders have
long understood that a "Fortress America" approach is a source of
national insecurity. Franklin Roosevelt made this case in a series of
"fireside chats" in the run-up to America's participation in World War
II --- even before the advent of the far more sophisticated
power-projection technologies that exist today. Roosevelt and his
generals well understood that the United States could not be safe if
hostile powers controlled Europe and Asia, despite the wide oceans
separating North America from both theaters. [A
[spheres]{.underline}]{.mark}[-of-influence [world
would]{.mark}]{.underline} also [**[crack up]{.underline}** [the
integrated]{.underline}]{.mark} [global [economy]{.mark}]{.underline}
that underlies the miracle in human welfare that has lifted billions out
of poverty in past decades. [[It would replicate]{.mark} the
**[exclusive economic blocs]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of the
1930s]{.underline}, [including an East Asia]{.underline} "co-prosperity
sphere," [[seeding conflict]{.mark} and undercutting
prosperity]{.underline}. A real-world and real-time example of what
happens when American power retreats in an effort to encourage regional
powers to solve their own problems is the mess in Syria. It has produced
the greatest refugee crisis since 1945 --- a stain on the consciousness
of human civilization --- and has led many to conclude that the Middle
Eastern order of states dating to the end of World War 1 is collapsing.
President Obama pursued an express policy of retracting American
military power from the Middle East, including withdrawing all troops
from Iraq and refusing to intervene militarily when President Assad used
chemical weapons against his own people, despite a red-line injunction
from the United States not to do so. Obama and his White House political
advisors believed that American withdrawal from the Arab Middle East (if
not from the ironclad U.S. commitment to Israel) would lead a new
balance of power to form, one policed by regional powers rather than by
America. [This flawed]{.underline}, amoral, and [un-strategic approach
has led to a series of **hot wars **]{.underline}--- in
[Syria]{.underline}, [Iraq]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
[Yemen]{.underline} --- the [collapse of Arab allies' confidence in the
United States as an ally]{.underline}, [as well as]{.underline} an
[**intensified cold war** with Iran]{.underline}. [Despite the
international agreement]{.underline} freezing Iran's nuclear program,
[Iran's support for terrorism and hostile insurgencies targeting
American allies across its region actually **intensified** during this
period]{.underline}. A [[spheres]{.mark}-of-influence]{.underline} world
[[leaves weaker states to become the victims of
stronger]{.underline}]{.mark} or more [aggressive
[ones]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [[it seeds **insecurity**
by]{.underline} [removing]{.underline}]{.mark} [the reassuring variable
of [American military guarantees]{.mark} and presence]{.underline} This
experience underlines a core problem with a
[spheres-of-influence]{.underline} world. It leaves weaker states to
become the victims of stronger or more aggressive ones, and it seeds
insecurity by removing the reassuring variable of American military
guarantees and presence. [It **emboldens American adversaries** and
leads American allies to take self-help measures that themselves may
**undercut** American security interests]{.underline}. A
[[spheres]{.mark}-of-influence world]{.underline} would also [[produce
contestation of the]{.mark} open [global commons]{.mark}]{.underline}
[that are the basis for the **unprecedented prosperity**]{.underline}
produced by the liberal international economic order. [Should
[the]{.mark} Indian and Pacific [Oceans]{.mark}]{.underline}, or the
[Arctic and Mediterranean Seas]{.underline}, [[become arenas of
great-power conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} (like the South China Sea
already has thanks to China's militarization and unilateral assertion of
sovereignty over it) [as leading states seek to incorporate them into
their privileged zones of control]{.underline}, [[economic globalization
would **collapse**]{.mark}, harming the economies of every major
power.]{.underline} [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline},
because of its sheer power and resource base as well as its relative
geographical isolation, [[might do OK]{.underline}]{.mark} in a
spheres-of-influence world. Most of [[America's]{.mark} friends and
[allies would not]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Their
weakening]{.underline}]{.mark} [and insecurity [would]{.mark} in turn
[render the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates weaker and more
[insecure]{.mark}]{.underline} --- since [[U.S. allies are
**force-multipliers**]{.underline} [for American hard and soft
power]{.underline}]{.mark}, and since norms like [freedom of the global
commons]{.underline} [are]{.underline} in fact [underwritten by that
power]{.underline}. More broadly, [such [a
transition]{.mark}]{.underline} [[would]{.underline}]{.mark} also likely
[[lead to]{.mark} the kind of [**hot wars** that **reorder the
international balance of power**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[including]{.underline} by **[incentivizing aggressive states to push
out and assert regional dominion]{.underline}**, [knowing that America
does not have the will or interest to oppose them]{.underline}. [The
fact that]{.underline} U.S. [competitors]{.underline} such as
[Russia]{.underline}, [China]{.underline}, [and
Iran]{.underline} --- all of whom want to weaken the American-led world
order --- [would welcome a spheres-of-influence world is another reason
for Americans to oppose it]{.underline}. It would also be ironic if the
United States were to back away from its historic commitment to shaping
a world that is an idealized vision of America itself --- one ruled by
laws, norms, institutions, markets, and peaceful settlement of disputes.

Ultimately, however, we concluded that [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited

**precluding**]{.mark} **the emergence of [another bipolar
world]{.mark}**]{.underline}---as in the Cold War---[[or]{.mark} a world
of **[many]{.mark} great [powers]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as existed
before the two world wars. [[Multipolarity led to]{.mark} two [world

protracted [worldwide struggle with the [**risk of nuclear

agreed that [[our objective must be to prevent a hostile power to

"tanker war" of the Iran-Iraq war, which eventually escalated into a
direct military conflict between the United States and Iran. Iran's

#### Fettweis is wrong

October, Review of Dangerous Times? The International Politics of Great
Power Peace By Christopher J. Fettweis, Joint Force Quarterly, Issue 63,
p. 150

Forget Clausewitz, Sun Tzu, and Machiavelli. Put aside Mackinder, Mahan,
and Spykman. Close the military academies and war colleges. Shut our
overseas bases. [Bring our troops home. Make dramatic cuts in the
defense budget. The end of major war]{.underline}, and perhaps the end
of war itself, [is near, according to]{.underline} Tulane assistant
professor Christopher [Fettweis]{.underline} in his recent book,
Dangerous Times? The International Politics of Great Power Peace.

Fettweis is not the first intellectual, nor will he be the last, to
proclaim the onset of perpetual peace. He is squarely in the tradition
of Immanuel Kant, Herbert Spencer, and Norman Angell, to name just
three. Indeed, in the book's introduction, Fettweis attempts to
rehabilitate Angell's reputation for prophecy, which suffered a
devastating blow when the Great War falsified his claim in The Great
Illusion that economic interdependence had rendered great power war
obsolete. Angell, Fettweis writes, was the first "prominent
constructivist thinker of the twentieth century," and was not
wrong---just ahead of his time (p. 5).

Fettweis bases his theory or vision of the obsolescence of major war on
the supposed linear progress of human nature, a major tenet of
20th-century liberalism that is rooted in the rationalist theories of
the Enlightenment. "History," according to Fettweis, "seems to be
unfolding as a line extending into the future---a halting, incomplete,
inconsistent line perhaps, one with frequent temporary reversals, but a
line nonetheless." The world is growing "more liberal and more reliant
upon reason, logic, and science" (p. 217).

[We have heard this all before]{.underline}. Human nature can be
perfected. Statesmen and [leaders will be guided by reason]{.underline}
and science. Such thinking influenced the visionaries of the French
Revolution and produced 25 years of war among the great powers of
Europe. Similar ideas influenced President Woodrow Wilson and his
intellectual supporters who endeavored at Versailles to transform the
horrors of World War I into a peace that would make that conflict "the
war to end all wars." What followed were disarmament conferences, an
international agreement to outlaw war, the rise of expansionist powers,
appeasement by the democracies, and the most destructive war in human
history. [Ideas, which Fettweis claims will bring about the
proliferation of peace]{.underline}, [transformed Russia, Germany, and
Japan into expansionist, totalitarian powers]{.underline}. Those same
ideas led to the Gulag, the Holocaust, and the Rape of Nanking. So much
for human progress.

[[Fettweis]{.underline}]{.mark} knows all of this, but [[claims]{.mark}
that since the end of the Cold War]{.underline}, the leaders and peoples
of [the [major powers]{.mark}, except the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [[have accepted]{.mark} the idea [that major war
is unthinkable]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [His proof is]{.underline}]{.mark}
[that there has been [no major war among]{.mark} the great powers [for
20 years]{.mark}]{.underline}[---[a]{.underline}]{.mark} [historical
[period that coincides with the American "unipolar"
moment]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This is very thin empirical evidence upon
which to base a predictive theory of international
relations.]{.underline}

Fettweis criticizes the realist and neorealist schools of thought,
claiming that their adherents focus too narrowly on the past behavior of
states in the international system. In his view, realists place too
great an emphasis on power. Ideas and norms instead of power, he claims,
provide structure to the international system. Classical geopolitical
theorists such as Halford Mackinder, Alfred Thayer Mahan, Nicholas
Spykman, and Colin Gray are dismissed by Fettweis in less than two
pages, despite the fact that their analyses of great power politics and
conflict have long been considered sound and frequently prescient.

[[Realists]{.mark} and classical geopoliticians
[have]{.mark}]{.underline} more than [[2,000 years of]{.mark} empirical
[evidence]{.mark}]{.underline} [to support their theories of how states
and empires behave and how the international system works]{.underline}.
[[Ideas are important, but]{.underline} [power is the governing
force]{.underline}]{.mark} [in international politics]{.underline}, and
geography is the most permanent factor in the analysis of power.

[Fettweis makes much of the fact that]{.underline} the countries of
Western and Central [Europe]{.underline}, which waged war against each
other repeatedly for nearly 400 years, [are at peace]{.underline}, and
claims that there is little likelihood that they will ever again wage
war against each other. Even if the latter assertion turns out to be
true, [that does not mean that the end of major war is in
sight]{.underline}. Throughout history, some peoples and empires that
previously waged war for one reason or another became pacific without
producing worldwide perpetual peace: the Mongols, Saracens, Ottomans,
Dutch, Venetians, and the Spanish Empire come immediately to mind. A
Europe at peace does not translate to an Asia, Africa, and Middle East
at peace.

In a world in which major wars are obsolete, [[Fettweis believes the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[needs
to]{.underline} [adjust its grand strategy]{.underline}]{.mark} [from
vigorous internationalism [to]{.mark} strategic
[restraint]{.mark}]{.underline}. His specific recommendations include
the removal of all U.S. military forces from Europe; an end to our
bilateral security guarantees to Japan and South Korea; an end to our
alliance with Israel; an indifference to the balance of power on the
Eurasian landmass; a law enforcement approach to terrorism; a drastic
cut in military spending; a much smaller Navy; and the abolition of
regional combatant commands.

What [Fettweis is proposing]{.underline} is effectively [an end
to]{.underline} what Walter Russell Mead calls "[[the maritime world
order]{.underline}]{.mark}" that was established by Great Britain and
maintained first by the British Empire and then by the United States.
[It is a world order that [has]{.mark}]{.underline} [[defeated]{.mark}
repeated [challenges by potential hegemonic powers]{.mark}]{.underline}
[and resulted in an unprecedented spread of prosperity and
freedom]{.underline}. [[But]{.underline}]{.mark} [all of [that, we are
assured, is in the past. China poses no threat]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[can]{.mark} safely [withdraw]{.mark} from Eurasia]{.underline}. The
power vacuum will remain unfilled.

[[Fettweis needs]{.mark} a dose of [humility]{.mark}]{.underline}. Sir
Halford Mackinder, the greatest of all geopoliticians, was referring to
visionaries and liberal idealists like Fettweis when he cautioned, "He
would be a sanguine man . . . who would trust the future peace of the
world to a change in the mentality of any nation." Most profoundly,
General Douglas MacArthur, who knew a little bit more about war and
international conflict than Fettweis, reminded the cadets at West Point
in 1962 that "only the dead have seen the end of war."

#### It has no empirical backing

<https://networks.h-net.org/node/28443/discussions/63534/issf-roundtable-pathologies-power-fear-honor-glory-and-hubris-us)>

Fettweis is clear that he is writing to change (or begin to change) the
national conversation in the United States regarding foreign policy.
Thus, [Fettweis\'s target audience is]{.underline} policymakers and [the
general public. This]{.underline} fact [can make the book
frustrating]{.underline} reading for scholars. For example, [[Fettweis
**does not**]{.underline}]{.mark} always [**[back]{.mark} his [claims
with evidence]{.mark}** or citations. More problematic]{.underline},
however, [is Fettweis\'s call for]{.underline} a rational basis for
[policymaking based on]{.underline} the American [national interest.
What does that mean?]{.underline} Scott [Burchill goes so far as to call
the]{.underline} concept of the [national interest devoid of
**substantive content**]{.underline}.\[5\] Thus, [the
concept]{.underline} of the national interest, to say the least, [is
**rarely clear**]{.underline}---and [that means]{.underline} that [the
rational pursuit]{.underline} of the national interest [is at
best]{.underline} a [very difficult]{.underline} endeavor. Moreover,
[there are multiple modes of rationality. A policymaker
who]{.underline}, like most modern presidents, [obsessively monitors
polling]{.underline} as a basis of policymaking [is being
rational]{.underline} \-- [even if it is]{.underline} a
[different]{.underline} rationality than that which Fettweis calls for.
[[Fettweis]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, largely [**leaves aside**
these issues. He never]{.underline} explicitly [explores the
sources]{.underline} or foundations [of rationality other
than]{.underline} to invoke [classical realism. He **[does not
address]{.mark}**]{.underline} the [[substantial **scholarly
literature** wrestling with]{.underline}]{.mark} the concept of [[a
national interest]{.underline}]{.mark}. Going further, the growing
literature on securitization theory problematizes the idea that threats
are objective conditions that can be clearly identified by savvy or wise
policymakers.\[6\] [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} in turn
[[undermines]{.underline}]{.mark} the objectivist ontology that
underlies [[Fettweis\'s thesis]{.underline}]{.mark}. If it is the case
that threats are intersubjective constructions rather than objective
conditions, Fettweis\' argument is robbed of its prescriptive force. To
be sure, Fettweis\'s critique of the flaws in U.S. foreign policy
remains trenchant. But [[the call]{.mark} to rational
assessment]{.underline} of objective foreign threats
[[becomes]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[hollow]{.underline}]{.mark}** one.
In part [these issues arise because of the 'bridging the gap' agenda
within]{.underline} which Fettweis situates [the book]{.underline}. As
the existence of programs like American University\'s International
Policy Summer Institute and the resurgent debate over the
policy-academia gulf attest,\[7\] efforts like Fettweis\'s are both
badly needed and very welcome. But if bridging the gap were easy, there
would be little need to encourage scholars and policymakers to do it.
Fettweis\'s effort demonstrates just how difficult it can be to satisfy
both sides. [[Academics will be frustrated by Fettweis\'s refusal to
engage in]{.underline}]{.mark} explicit theory building or [[empirical
**verification**]{.mark}. Policymakers will]{.underline} no doubt [be
frustrated by Fettweis\'s **amorphous**]{.underline} policy
[**guidance** to be rational]{.underline} and focus on the national
interest.

#### Fettweis makes terrible assumptions

**Beede 11 --** Benjamin R. Beede, Rutgers, The State University of New
JerseyFettweis, Christopher J. 2008. Losing Hurts Twice as Bad: The Four
States to Moving Beyond Iraq. New York, NY

Fettweis' book might easily be dismissed as an intriguing analysis, but
one that has been superseded by the advent of the Obama Administration,
and the changes in direction that the Obama team has advocated and that
it may implement. [[Fettweis made **a number of assumptions**]{.mark}
**that [have]{.mark} now [been invalidated]{.mark}**]{.underline},
moreover, including a continuation of prosperity. Despite its flaws,
however, the book is a provocative contribution to the literature that
criticizes the forcefulness of the U.S. foreign and military policy.
Fettweis states that his objective is to analyze the "likely
consequences of disaster in Iraq" (16), but he really has two purposes.
One is to explain to people in the United States how they can adjust to
the loss of the Iraq war. The second is to persuade readers that the
United States can safely reduce its activity in international affairs.
Although the author's discussion of Iraq must be addressed, this review
emphasizes Fettweis' contention that the United States can safely be
less assertive in world affairs because the world is not as dangerous a
place as often claimed, and his closely related point that the public
needs to develop a more discriminating approach to assessing threats
from abroad, thereby enabling it to hold its government to higher levels
of competency and accountability. Fettweis' book title comes from a
remark by sports figure Sparky Anderson that "losing hurts twice as bad
as winning feels good" (13). He believes that this observation is valid,
and he comes back to those words repeatedly. To support his contention
concerning the significance of Anderson's statement, Fettweis borrows
from the literature of psychology to explain how people experience
losses, ranging from having relatives or friends taken from them by
death to having their favorite sports teams lose games. In competitive
situations, the harmful psychological effects of losing are said to be
intensified significantly when one adversary or opponent was "supposed"
to win because of its strength. The number of instances where large
countries have lost to guerrilla movements demonstrates that perceptions
of the military advantages that the seemingly stronger side enjoys may
well be outweighed by other factors, however (see Arreguin-Toft 2005;
Record 2007). [Fettweis recommends **a rapid withdrawal**]{.underline}
of the U.S. forces from Iraq. He believes that the Iraq war has "been
the worst kind of defeat for the United States: an unnecessary one, in a
war that should never have been fought" (16, emphasis in the original).
Not only was the war a huge error, Iraq is in such bad OCTOBER BOOK
REVIEWS \| 865 shape that the United States cannot do much to assist its
reconstruction. A long-term occupation might eliminate many problems in
Iraq, but he doubts the United States will stay long enough to affect
major changes in that country. Little harm will come from the
withdrawal, despite predictions by many that there would be civil war in
Iraq and a security breakdown in the entire region. Fettweis is not a
specialist in Middle Eastern affairs, and his interest is in the effects
the Iraq war is having and will have on the United States, not so much
in the Iraq situation. Thus, his book is not comparable to studies like
that by O'Leary (2009). [[There are at least two schools of
thought]{.mark} about]{.underline} the [Iraq]{.underline} war, **[[but
Fettweis ignores this division]{.underline}]{.mark}** of opinion. One
school, which includes Fettweis, criticizes the Bush Administration for
having rashly invaded Iraq and for having failed to plan and execute the
operation properly. Fettweis writes that "\[w\]e were led into the Iraq
morass not by evil people lying on behalf of oil companies but by poor
strategists with a shallow, naive understanding of international
politics" (29). Another school of interpretation views the Iraq (and
Afghanistan) commitments simply as steps in a campaign undertaken to
give the United States a lasting hegemony in the world. From the Bush
Administration's perspective, Iraq might even be considered a success.
The executive branch demonstrated once again that it can wage war with
few checks on its actions, and gave the United States a greater presence
in the Middle East. The **[Obama]{.underline}** Administration **[has
altered Bush's course]{.underline}** to some extent, but so far, there
has not been a radical shift. Indeed, there has been and remains the
possibility of a greater commitment in the region, especially into
Pakistan. Iraq and the United States have agreed to the removal of
coalition forces by 2011, but the continued violence in Iraq and the
construction of substantial military bases suggest that a U.S. military
presence might continue past 2011. In February 2009, Secretary of
Defense Gates reiterated the Obama Administration's commitment to 2011,
but in late May 2009, the army chief of staff, George Casey, declared
that his service branch, at least, is planning for U.S. forces to remain
in Iraq for another decade. In any event, there is little prospect for a
full disengagement from southwest Asia any time soon. Given one of the
purposes of his book, it is hardly surprising that Fettweis focuses
almost entirely on Iraq. He ignores Afghanistan, except for repeatedly
citing the Soviet persistence in trying to hold that country as an
example of a great power making the error of invading a small country in
the face of deep nationalism in the latter. He might have been well
advised to view the entire area of southwestern Asia. Ahmed Rashid
(2008) has described the U.S. involvement in the region that has
extended well beyond Iraq and Afghanistan, and that suffers from the
same kinds of misjudgments made in Iraq and Afghanistan, especially an
overreliance on military measures and a reluctance to commit substantial
resources to economic development. [Fettweis uses Iraq to argue **for
a**]{.underline} strategy of **[restraint]{.underline}** based on his
sanguine view that "we \[the United States and, indeed, the entire
world\] are living in a golden age" (31, emphasis in the original), and
that "\[g\]reat power conflict today is all but unthinkable; therefore,
calculations surrounding the dangers posed by a united Eurasia should
change, since the threats it once posed no longer exist" (208). With the
end of the Cold War, the ability of the enemies of the United States to
harm this country is quite limited. Hostile acts can be perpetrated, but
such attacks cannot overthrow the United States (31). This strategy is
hardly new. Years ago, it was summarized in these words, "Instead of
preserving obsolete Cold War alliances and embarking on an expensive and
dangerous campaign for global stability, the United States should view
the collapse of Soviet power as an opportunity to adopt a less
interventionist policy" (Carpenter 1992, 167). [[Despite the optimistic
picture painted]{.mark} by some national security theorists, **[the
world does contain]{.mark} some [dangerous
elements]{.mark}**]{.underline}. David E. [[Sanger]{.underline}]{.mark}
(2009), for example, [[presents **a chilling picture of
nuc**]{.mark}**lear weapon[s in]{.mark} very possibly [unsteady]{.mark}
[hands]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Much is said in the book concerning
national "credibility," that is, the ability of a country to maintain
its prestige and its reputation for decisive action based on its past
performance. Fettweis argues that many governmental leaders, academic
commentators, and journalists have been obsessed with this element of
national power and have wanted the United States to deal with virtually
any political crisis that occurs (161-75). [[Fettweis states
that]{.mark} "\[f\]or some reason, U.S. [policymakers seem to be]{.mark}
especially [prone to overestimate]{.mark} the [threats]{.mark} they
face"]{.underline} (116). [[There is no explanation]{.mark} of **[why
this should be the case]{.mark}**, nor is there any comparison with the
propensity of leaders in other countries to make similar inaccurate
projections.]{.underline} Numerous instances can be cited where
governmental leaders and commentators have argued heatedly for "action"
on the ground that "inaction" will damage the reputation of the United
States. Early in the Carter Administration, for example, National
Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski dedicated himself for some time to
instigating the dispatch of navy task force to the Horn of Africa during
a period of tension between Ethiopia and Somalia. After failing to
persuade the secretaries of state and defense that such action was
necessary, Brzezinski waged a covert effort through the media to bring a
decision in favor of his policy (Gardner 2008, 40-2). Two case histories
cited in the book as examples of a disastrous insistence on maintaining
credibility are the Spanish and British efforts to hold the Netherlands
and the British colonies that became the United States, respectively.
More recent instances that could have been cited are the controversies
in the United States concerning the "loss" of China in the late 1940s
and the establishment of a communist regime in Cuba in the late 1950s.
Sensitivity concerning Cuba led in part to the intervention in the
Dominican Republic in 1965, and other episodes where the United States
committed itself to fighting insurgencies in Latin America. OCTOBER BOOK
REVIEWS \| 867 Concerns about the political impact of the "loss" of
Vietnam played a significant role in decisions to support the Republic
of Vietnam. These episodes are largely omitted, though. Fear is a potent
political weapon, and foreign threats, whether real or imaginary, are
highly useful within the domestic political arena. Claims of a "missile
gap" helped John F. Kennedy win the presidency, for example. The armed
services and the various intelligence agencies are rewarded because of
fears of foreign threats. Although the armed forces may be cautious
about entering a given conflict or making other violent moves, they are
unlikely to stress the peaceful nature of the world if they want to
retain their budgets and their prestige. Another element in strategy
formulation in the United States has been its experience with long-term
threats. White (1997) asserts that the long conflict with the Soviet
Union fundamentally structured the discussion and resolution of public
policy issues in the United States, and greatly strengthened the
presidency at the expense of Congress and the political parties.
Although his book was written before 9/11, his observation that
political activists and the public have become accustomed to protracted
battles with foreign enemies makes it easy to understand why they could
readily accept a "long war" against terrorism. Somewhat along the same
line, Sherry (1995) maintains that this country has been under emergency
conditions from the Great Depression onward, perhaps even before,
permeating the United States with "militarism" in its broadest sense.
Going back even further, some writers have argued that United States'
assertiveness may be traced to the late nineteenth and especially the
early twentieth century. Lears (2009) points critically to Theodore
Roosevelt as a key player in this development, and Ninkovich (1999)
offers a more favorable view of the "crisis internationalism" of Woodrow
Wilson. [[Fettweis]{.underline}]{.mark} touches on this history, but he
[[underestimates the extent to which]{.mark} [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [has been conditioned to **react vigorously**]{.mark} to
a range of foreign policy issues, and overestimates the differences in
foreign and military policy brought about by changes from one
administration to another]{.underline}. Given this conditioning,
changing the mind-sets of both elites and the public may be an extremely
difficult task. [To a degree, Fettweis' arguments resemble those of the
"American empire" theorists]{.underline}, such as Bacevich (2008),
Johnson (2006), and Gardner and Young (2005). [Critics of the "American
empire" believe that the United States produces much of the
unrest]{.underline} and the tension in the world through its unilateral
actions and its emphasis on military power. Fettweis does not go that
far, but [his advocacy of "strategic restraint" is certainly compatible
with such views.]{.underline} He agrees that the United States'
involvements---especially military commitments---abroad may unsettle
conditions in countries as much as they may stabilize them, but his
purpose is primarily to reassure the people of the United States that
less assertive activity by their country will not result in world chaos.
Thus he does not have much to say about the motivations of elite figures
868 \| POLITICS & POLICY / October 2011 who advocate an active foreign
policy. His argument seems to be that the United States is vastly
overextended in its commitments as a result of a number of individual
mistakes stemming from an overconcern with credibility rather than a
flawed strategy. Despite his disclaimers, [Fettweis' words sometimes
resemble the arguments of pre-World War II isolationists]{.underline}.
Indeed, throughout the book, the word "internationalists," which
properly describes those concerned with international cooperation, is
used to refer to those who should be termed "interventionists," whether
their motivations are power political, economic, or humanitarian, or a
mixture of the three. [Fettweis believes that there was little that the
United States could have done to prevent the outbreak of World War II in
Europe,]{.underline} moreover. [On the contrary, **firmer** U.S.
**support** of France and Great Britain might have encouraged those
countries to force Germany to evacuate the newly reoccupied Rhineland
and to render it much more cautious in its later actions.]{.underline}
After he successfully implemented his plan to put troops into the
Rhineland in 1936, Hitler told his confidants that a French demand for a
withdrawal would have been successful owing to Germany's military
weakness. [Fettweis even praises the United States because it "had the
wisdom to remain neutral for more than two years]{.underline}" and thus
"escaped the worst of the suffering" (206). **[This is surely
wrong.]{.underline}** [An earlier involvement in the war would doubtless
have reduced U.S. casualties]{.underline} and other costs because
invasions of Europe would have been unnecessary if the French and
British had held at least part of the continent, and because Germany
might not have developed a cushion of occupied territories to protect it
from land attacks and from air assaults for a time. Whether a public
educated by books like this one would be able to make suitable threat
assessments, and thereby be better able to exercise control over
governmental actions abroad is another question. [Fettweis' work may be
quite persuasive because he expresses his views clearly and avoids
highly charged language.]{.underline} However, if elites agree about
dangers from abroad, then popular opinion may have little effect on
policy making and policy implementation. [[Fettweis' thinking is
**significantly flawed**]{.underline} [by his assumption that "politics
is]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and always will be, [the enemy of]{.mark}
[strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}[,"]{.mark} and reiterates his point (26,
157). Fettweis adds that "it would be naive to suggest that it is
possible to keep politics completely separate from strategy, nor would
it be fully desirable to do so in a democracy" (26-7), but "for the sake
of this book, we will attempt to clarify the national interest by
keeping the two realms separate, to the extent possible" (27).
Determining national strategy is necessarily a highly political act, and
it cannot be established without considering the demands of major
internal stakeholders. What he terms "politics" may often be differing
opinions based on different data or interpretations of the same data.
Political survival is critical for a political leader, and such leaders
can understandably be hesitant in exercising restraint if they believe
their opponents will attack them, perhaps decisively, for being "soft"
on the enemies of the day. Fettweis is fond of the term "realist" to

analysts, but describing someone as a "realist" may simply mean that the
person agrees with the views of the individual applying that
description. In certain instances, "realism" can mean being restrained,

decisions are likely to be made on the basis of accurate intelligence

### War\-\--A2: No Escalation

#### Taiwan war causes extinction- no checks on escalation

**Littlefield 15** (8/11, Alex Littlefield is a professor at Feng Chia
University, Dr. Adam Lowther is Director, School of Advanced Nuclear
Deterrence Studies, Air Force Global Strike Command, Taiwan and the
Prospects for War Between China and America,
<http://thediplomat.com/2015/08/taiwan-and-the-prospects-for-war-between-china-and-america/>)

For the United States and its allies and partners in Asia, China's
aggressive efforts to assert questionable claims in the South and East
China Sea, enforce a disputed Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ),
build the rocket/missile and naval capabilities needed to invade Taiwan,
and build a substantial ballistic missile capability all work to create
a situation where [conflict between the U.S. and the PRC could occur and
rapidly escalate]{.underline}. Given that
[[American]{.underline}]{.mark} political and military [[leaders have a
poor understanding of Chinese ambitions and]{.underline}]{.mark}
particularly their opaque [[nuclear]{.mark}
[thinking]{.mark}]{.underline}, there is ample reason to be concerned
that a future **[conflict could escalate to]{.underline}** a limited
**[nuclear]{.underline}** conflict. Thus, it is worth taking a look at
the PRC with an eye toward offering insight into Chinese motivation and
thinking when it comes to how a possible **[[crisis over Taiwan could
escalate to]{.mark} the [use of nuclear weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Chinese Capabilities In their latest estimate, Hans M. Kristensen and
Robert S. Norris assess that the Second Artillery Corps possesses forty
long-range nuclear missiles that can strike the United States if fired
from China's eastern seaboard and an additional twenty that could hit
Hawaii and Alaska. The challenge for China, is reaching the East Coast
-- home to the nation's capital and largest economic centers. To
overcome this challenge China is also developing its JL-2
submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) which is a sea-based variant
of the DF-31 land-mobile long-range missile that will go to sea on
Jin-class submarines. China may also be developing a new mobile missile,
the DF-41, which will carry multiple warheads, giving the Chinese a way
to potentially defeat an American ballistic missile defense system. It
is worth noting that the quantity, though not the quality, of China's
nuclear arsenal is only limited by its dwindling stock of weapons grade
plutonium. This raises the question; to what end is China developing and
deploying its nuclear arsenal? Chinese Motivation The textbook answer is
straightforward. China seeks a secure second (retaliatory) strike
capability that will serve to deter an American first strike. As China
argues, it has a "no-nuclear-first policy" which makes its arsenal
purely defensive -- while its other capabilities such as cyber are
offensive. Potential nuclear adversaries including Russia, India, and
the United States are fully aware that China's investment in advanced
warheads and ballistic missile delivery systems bring Delhi, Moscow,
and, soon, Washington within reach of the "East Wind." While not a
nuclear peer competitor to either Russia or the U.S., China is rapidly
catching up as it builds an estimated 30-50 new nuclear warheads each
year. While American leaders may find such a sentiment unfounded, the
PRC has a strong fear that the United States will use its nuclear
arsenal as a tool to blackmail (coerce) China into taking or not taking
a number of actions that are against its interests. China's fears are
not unfounded. Unlike China, the United States maintains an ambiguous
use-policy in order to provide maximum flexibility. As declassified
government documents from the 1970s clearly show, the United States
certainly planned to use overwhelming nuclear force early in a European
conflict with the Soviet Union. Given American nuclear superiority and
its positioning of ballistic missile defenses in Asia, ostensibly to
defend against a North Korean attack, China sees its position and
ability to deter the United States as vulnerable. Possible Scenario
While there are several scenarios where conflict between the United
States and China is possible, some analysts believe that a conflict over
[Taiwan]{.underline} [**[remains the most likely place]{.underline}**
[where the PRC and the U.S. would come to blows]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Beijing is aware that [[any coercive action]{.underline}]{.mark} on its
part to force Taiwan to accept its political domination [could
[incur]{.mark} the [wrath of the]{.mark} United States.
\[[US]{.mark}\]]{.underline}To prevent the U.S. from intervening in the
region, China will certainly turn to its anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD)
strategy, beginning with non-lethal means and non-lethal threats to
discourage the American public from supporting the use of force in
support of Taiwan. If thwarted in its initial efforts to stop Chinese
aggression against Taiwan, the United States may be tempted to resort to
stronger measures and attack mainland China. A [kinetic [response
to]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[cyber-attack]{.underline}]{.mark}, for
example, although an option, [[would]{.underline}]{.mark} very likely
[[lead to escalation]{.underline}]{.mark} on the part of the Chinese.
[[Given]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[regime's]{.underline}]{.mark}
relative [[weakness]{.underline} [and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
probability that American [[attacks]{.underline}]{.mark} (cyber and
conventional) [[on]{.underline}]{.mark} China will include strikes
against PLA command and control ([[C2]{.underline}]{.mark}) nodes,
[[which mingle conventional and nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark} C2, **[[the
Chinese may escalate to]{.underline}]{.mark}** the use of a
**[[nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark}** weapon (against a U.S. carrier in
China's self-declared waters for example) [as a means of forcing
de-escalation]{.underline}. In the view of China, [[such]{.mark} a
strike [would not]{.mark} be a [violat]{.mark}ion of]{.underline} its
[[no-first-use]{.underline}]{.mark} policy [[because]{.mark} the [strike
would occur in sovereign]{.mark} Chinese [waters]{.mark}]{.underline},
thus [[making]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[use]{.underline}]{.mark} of
nuclear weapons a [[defensive]{.underline}]{.mark} act. [Since Taiwan is
a domestic matter, any U.S. intervention would be viewed as]{.underline}
an act of [aggression]{.underline}. This, in the minds of the Chinese,
makes the United States an outside aggressor, not China. It is also
important to remember that [nuclear weapons are an asymmetric response
to American conventional superiority]{.underline}. Given that China is
incapable of executing and sustaining a conventional military campaign
against the continental United States, [[China would]{.mark} clearly
[have]{.mark} an [asymmetry]{.mark} [of interest and capability]{.mark}
with the United States]{.underline} -- far more is at stake for China
than it is for the United States. In essence, **[[the only effective
option]{.underline}]{.mark}** in retaliation for a successful U.S.
conventional campaign on Chinese soil [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark} one. Without making too crude a point,
the nuclear option provides more bang for the buck, or yuan. Given that
mutually assured destruction (MAD) is not part of China's strategic
thinking -- in fact it is explicitly rejected -- the PRC will see the
situation very differently than the United States. China likely has no
desire to become a nuclear peer of the United States. It does not need
to be in order to achieve its geopolitical objectives. However,
[China]{.underline} does have specific goals that are a part of its
[stated core security interests]{.underline}, [including reunification
with Taiwan.]{.underline} Reunification is necessary for China to reach
its unstated goal of becoming a regional hegemon. As long as Taiwan
maintains its de facto independence of China it acts as a literal and
symbolic barrier to China's power projection beyond the East China Sea.
Without Taiwan, China cannot gain military hegemony in its own
neighborhood. China's maritime land reclamation strategy for Southeast
Asia pales in scope and significance with the historical and political
value of Taiwan. With Taiwan returned to its rightful place, the
relevance to China of the U.S. military presence in Japan and South
Korea is greatly diminished. China's relationship with the Philippines,
which lies just to the south of Taiwan, would also change dramatically.
Although China criticizes the United States for playing the role of
global hegemon, it is actively seeking to supplant the United States in
Asia so that it can play a similar role in the region. While Beijing may
take a longer view toward geopolitical issues than Washington does,
Chinese political leaders must still be responsive to a domestic
audience that demands ever higher levels of prosperity. Central to
China's ability to guarantee that prosperity is the return of Taiwan,
and control of the sea lines of commerce and communication upon which it
relies. Unfortunately, too many Americans underestimate the importance
of these core interests to China and the lengths to which China will
ultimately go in order to guarantee them -- even the use of nuclear
weapons. Should China succeed it pushing the United States back, the PRC
can deal with regional territorial disputes bilaterally and without U.S.
involvement. After all, Washington invariably takes the non-Chinese
side. China sees the U.S. as a direct competitor and obstacle to its
geopolitical ambitions. As such it is preparing for the next step in a
crisis that it will likely instigate, control, and conclude in the
Taiwan Straits. [[China will likely use]{.underline}]{.mark} the
election or [[statement of a pro-independence high-ranking official
as]{.mark} the [impetus]{.mark} [for]{.mark}
[action]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[This is the]{.mark} same [method it
used]{.mark} when it fired missiles]{.underline}
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} the Straits in response to remarks by
then-President Lee Teng-hui, ushering in [[the]{.mark} 19[96]{.mark}
Taiwan Straits [Crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}. The U.S. brought an end to
the mainland's antics when the U.S.S Nimitz and six additional ships
sailed into the Straits. Despite the pro-China presidency of Ma
Ying-jeou, China continues to expand its missile force targeting Taiwan
and undertakes annual war games that simulate an attack on Taiwan. China
has not forgotten the humiliation it faced in 1996 and will be certain
no U.S. carrier groups have access to the Strait during the next crisis.
**[The Second Artillery Corps' [nuclear capabilities exist to help
secure]{.mark} the [results China seeks when the U.S.
is]{.mark}]{.underline}** caught off-guard, overwhelmed, and **[[forced
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** either **[[escalate]{.underline}]{.mark}** a
crisis **[[or capitulate]{.underline}]{.mark}**. While [[the scenario
described is]{.mark} certainly [not inevitable]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
fact than many American readers will see it as implausible if not
impossible is an example of the mirror-imaging that often occurs when
attempting to understand an adversary. China is not the United States
nor do Chinese leaders think like their counterparts in the United
States. [Unless we give serious thought to possible scenarios where
nuclear conflict could occur, [the United States may be unprepared for a
situation that escalates beyond its ability to prevent a
catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[A [war between China, Taiwan and the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[has]{.mark} the [potential to escalate into]{.mark} a [nuclear conflict
and]{.mark} a third [world war]{.mark}]{.underline}, therefore, [many
countries]{.underline} other than the primary actors [could be affected
by such a conflict, including Japan, both Koreas, [Russia]{.mark},
Australia, [India]{.mark} and Great]{.underline} [Britain, if they [were
drawn in]{.mark}to the war, as well as all other countries in the world
that participate in the global economy, in which the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and China are the]{.underline} two [most
dominant]{.underline} members. [If China were]{.underline} able
[to]{.underline} successfully [annex Taiwan]{.underline}, [the
possibility exists that they could then plan to attack Japan and begin a
policy of aggressive expansionism]{.underline} in East and Southeast
Asia, as well as the Pacific and even into India, [which could
in]{.underline} [turn create an international standoff and deployment of
military forces to contain the threat]{.underline}. In any case, [if
China and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates engage [in a
full-scale conflict, there are [few countries]{.mark} in the world that
[will not be]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}economically and/or
militarily [[affected]{.underline}]{.mark} by it. However, China, Taiwan
and United States are the primary actors in this scenario, whose actions
will determine its eventual outcome, therefore, other countries will not
be considered in this study.

#### China/Taiwan war goes nuclear

Affairs at the Elliott School of International Affairs at George

THE PROSPECTS for avoiding intense military competition and war may be
good, but growth in China\'s power may nevertheless require some changes
in U.S. foreign policy that Washington will find
disagreeable\--particularly regarding Taiwan. Although it lost control
of Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War more than six decades ago,
[China]{.underline} still [considers Taiwan]{.underline} to be [part of
its homeland,]{.underline} and unification remains a key political goal
for Beijing. [[China has made clear that it will use force if]{.mark}
[Taiwan declares independence]{.mark},]{.underline} and much of
[[China\'s]{.mark} conventional [military buildup has been
dedicated]{.mark} [to]{.mark}]{.underline} increasing its ability to
[coerce [Taiwan]{.mark} and reducing the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates\' [ability to intervene]{.underline}. [[Because
China places such high value on Taiwan and]{.mark} because [the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and
China]{.underline}]{.mark}\--whatever they might formally agree
to\--[[have such different attitudes]{.underline}]{.mark} regarding the
legitimacy of the status quo, [[the issue poses special
dangers]{.underline}]{.mark} and challenges for the U.S.-Chinese
relationship, placing it in a different category than Japan or South
Korea. [[A crisis over Taiwan could]{.mark} fairly [easily escalate to
nuclear war]{.mark},]{.underline} because [[each step along the way
might]{.underline}]{.mark} well [[seem rational]{.mark} to the actors
involved.]{.underline} Current U.S. policy is designed to reduce the
probability that Taiwan will declare independence and to make clear that
the United States will not come to Taiwan\'s aid if it does.
Nevertheless, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}t]{.mark}ates [[would find itself under pressure to
protect Taiwan]{.mark} against any]{.underline} sort of [attack, no
matter how it originated.]{.underline} Given the different interests and
perceptions of the various parties and the limited control Washington
has over Taipei\'s behavior, a crisis could unfold in which the United
States found itself following events rather than leading them. Such
dangers have been around for decades, but [ongoing [improvements in
China\'s military capabilities may]{.mark} [make Beijing]{.mark} more
[willing to escalate a Taiwan crisis]{.mark}.]{.underline} In addition
to its improved conventional capabilities, [[China is modernizing its
nuclear forces to]{.mark} increase their ability to]{.underline} survive
and [[retaliate following a]{.mark} large-scale U[.S.
attack.]{.mark}]{.underline} Standard deterrence theory holds that
Washington\'s current ability to destroy most or all of China\'s nuclear
force enhances its bargaining position. [[China\'s]{.mark} nuclear
[modernization might remove that check on Chinese action, leading
Beijing to behave more boldly]{.mark} in future crises]{.underline} than
it has in past ones. [[A U.S. attempt to]{.mark} preserve its ability to
[defend Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}, meanwhile, [[could fuel a]{.mark}
conventional and [nuclear arms race]{.mark}.]{.underline} Enhancements
to U.S. offensive targeting capabilities and strategic ballistic missile
defenses might be interpreted by China as a signal of malign U.S.
motives, leading to further Chinese military efforts and a general
poisoning of U.S.-Chinese relations.

### War\-\--A2: No Impact

#### China war causes extinction

University. "Talking Policy: Ann Lee on US-China Relations." *World
Policy Journal*. February 10.

World Policy Journal: [When]{.underline} President [Trump was first
elected, you expressed worry about the future of U.S.-China relations.
Now that he\'s been in office for a few weeks, how do you think this
tension will play out?]{.underline}

Ann Lee: Well, [I don\'t think I\'ve changed my mind]{.underline} about
this [after seeing what has transpired]{.underline} with other nations.
[I don\'t think that it\'s necessarily going to go much more smoothly
with China]{.underline}.

WPJ: [What do you think the worst-case scenario would be?]{.underline}

AL: I think [[the worst-case scenario is that the U.S. and China fight a
real war where]{.mark} you have a series of [provocations]{.mark} that
somehow [end up becoming **World War III**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

WPJ: [How likely do you think that is?]{.underline}

AL: That\'s hard to say. I think that [based on some of his closest
advisors]{.underline} like Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon, [it\'s more
likely than not if he chooses to listen to whatever advice they give
him. Let\'s hope that\'s not the case, but it almost feels like there
are certain people in his administration that want a
war]{.underline}---are planning for one---and there are obviously media
reports that they seem to want one based on past interviews or
statements.

WPJ: We do not hear a lot of Chinese perspectives in the Western media.
[What has been the Chinese government's general reaction to the
proposals of the Trump administration?]{.underline}

AL: I think [the Chinese are just as concerned as anybody else in the
world]{.underline}. A lot of folks there have been disturbed by Trump\'s
actions in his first days in office---clearly the phone call he took
from Taiwan sort of set the precedent. And I think [[the Chinese are
under no illusions that it\'s going to be]{.mark} an [easy]{.mark} road
[dealing with]{.mark} the [Trump]{.mark} administration]{.underline}. I
am sure [[they are]{.mark} ready and [bracing for a very]{.mark}
tumultuous, [rocky road]{.mark} in this relationship. [Hopefully they
can avoid]{.mark} a situation where the two nations do go to [battle
because]{.mark} certainly [if that happens it would be **the end of
civilization as we know it**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### U.S.-China war causes nuclear extinction

**Wittner 11** --- Lawrence S. Wittner, Emeritus Professor of History at
the State University of New York at Albany, holds a Ph.D. in History
from Columbia University, 2011 ("Is a Nuclear War with China Possible?,"
*Huntington News*, November 28^th^, Available Online at
<http://www.huntingtonnews.net/14446>)

[[While nuclear weapons exist, there remains a danger]{.mark} that
**[they will be used]{.mark}**]{.underline}. After all, [for centuries
national conflicts have led to wars, with nations employing **their
deadliest weapons**. [The]{.mark} current [deterioration of]{.mark}
**U.S. [relations with China]{.mark}** [might end up]{.mark} providing
us with **yet [another example]{.mark}** of this
phenomenon]{.underline}. [The [gathering tension]{.mark} between the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and China [is
**clear**]{.mark}]{.underline} enough. Disturbed by China's growing
economic and military strength, the U.S. government recently challenged
China's claims in the South China Sea, increased the U.S. military
presence in Australia, and deepened U.S. military ties with other
nations in the Pacific region. According to Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton, the United States was "asserting our own position as a Pacific
power." But [need this lead to nuclear war?]{.underline} Not
necessarily. And yet, [there are signs that **it could**]{.underline}.
After all, [both the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and China
possess **large numbers** of nuclear weapons]{.underline}. The U.S.
government threatened to attack China with nuclear weapons during the
Korean War and, later, during the conflict over the future of China's
offshore islands, Quemoy and Matsu. In the midst of the latter
confrontation, President Dwight Eisenhower declared publicly, and
chillingly, that U.S. nuclear weapons would "be used just exactly as you
would use a bullet or anything else." Of course, China didn't have
nuclear weapons then. Now that it does, perhaps the behavior of national
leaders will be more temperate. But the loose nuclear threats of U.S.
and Soviet government officials during the Cold War, when both nations
had vast nuclear arsenals, should convince us that, even as the military
ante is raised, nuclear saber-rattling persists. [[Some]{.mark} pundits
[argue]{.mark} that [nuclear weapons prevent wars]{.mark} between
nuclear-armed nations]{.underline}; and, admittedly, there haven't been
very many---at least not yet. [But [the **Kargil War**]{.mark} of
1999]{.underline}, [between nuclear-armed India and nuclear-armed
Pakistan]{.underline}, [[should convince us that such wars **can**
occur]{.underline}]{.mark}. Indeed, in that case, the conflict almost
slipped into a nuclear war. Pakistan's foreign secretary threatened
that, if the war escalated, his country felt free to use "any weapon" in
its arsenal. During the conflict, Pakistan did move nuclear weapons
toward its border, while India, it is claimed, readied its own nuclear
missiles for an attack on Pakistan. At the least, though, don't nuclear
weapons deter a nuclear attack? Do they? Obviously, NATO leaders didn't
feel deterred, for, throughout the Cold War, NATO's strategy was to
respond to a Soviet conventional military attack on Western Europe by
launching a Western nuclear attack on the nuclear-armed Soviet Union.
Furthermore, if U.S. government officials really believed that nuclear
deterrence worked, they would not have resorted to championing "Star
Wars" and its modern variant, national missile defense. Why are these
vastly expensive---and probably unworkable---military defense systems
needed if other nuclear powers are deterred from attacking by U.S.
nuclear might? Of course, the bottom line for those Americans convinced
that nuclear weapons safeguard them from a Chinese nuclear attack might
be that the U.S. nuclear arsenal is far greater than its Chinese
counterpart. Today, it is estimated that the U.S. government possesses
over five thousand nuclear warheads, while the Chinese government has a
total inventory of roughly three hundred. Moreover, only about forty of
these Chinese nuclear weapons can reach the United States. Surely the
United States would "win" any nuclear war with China. But what would
that "victory" entail? [[A nuclear attack]{.mark} by China [would
**immediately slaughter**]{.mark} at least [10 million]{.mark} Americans
in a great storm of blast and fire, while leaving many more dying
horribly of sickness and radiation poisoning. The Chinese death toll in
a nuclear war would be **far higher**. Both nations would be reduced to
**smoldering, radioactive wastelands**]{.underline}. Also, [radioactive
debris sent aloft by the nuclear explosions would **blot out the sun**
[and bring on a "**nuclear winter**]{.mark}" around the
globe---**destroying agriculture**, **[creating worldwide
famine]{.mark}**, and **generating chaos and destruction**]{.underline}.
Moreover, in another decade the extent of this catastrophe would be far
worse. The Chinese government is currently expanding its nuclear
arsenal, and by the year 2020 it is expected to more than double its
number of nuclear weapons that can hit the United States. The U.S.
government, in turn, has plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars
"modernizing" its nuclear weapons and nuclear production facilities over
the next decade. [[To avert]{.mark} the enormous disaster of [a
U.S.-China nuclear war]{.mark}, there are]{.underline} two [**obvious
actions** that can be taken. The first is to get rid of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}, as the nuclear powers have agreed to do but thus
far have resisted doing. [The second]{.underline}, conducted while the
nuclear disarmament process is occurring, [is to **[improve U.S.-China
relations]{.mark}**. If the American and Chinese people are interested
in **[ensuring]{.mark} their [survival]{.mark} and that [of the
world]{.mark}**, they should be working to **encourage these
policies**]{.underline}.

### New Mod\-\--Chinese Aggression

#### Ending arms sales to Taiwan makes US look weaker than China, incentivizing further Chinese aggressiveness [internationally]{.underline}

political science at Davidson College, 11-11, "Why Giving Up Taiwan Will

Another strategic interest the United States has in maintaining close
ties to Taiwan rests with Taiwan's position on the front line of China's
rise. [[China's behav- ior to]{.mark}ward [Taiwan indicates]{.mark} how
it will perform [its role]{.mark} as a lead actor [on the world
stage]{.mark}. As]{.underline} Randall [Schriver, a former deputy
assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, put it,
"Beijing's ambitions go beyond Taiwan, but right now, it's the
[Taiwan]{.mark} issue that [drives]{.mark} [their]{.mark} military
[modernization]{.mark}]{.underline}, so it's very important to us.
[[Taiwan is a prism through which we can understand China]{.mark}'s
evolution]{.underline}, and gain insights into it." Richard
[[Bush]{.underline}]{.mark}, [a leading analyst of the US-PRC-Taiwan
relation- ship]{.underline}, summarized these concerns when he
[[said]{.mark}, "How the [Taiwan]{.mark} Strait issue is resolved
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} an important test--- perhaps [[the most
important test]{.mark}---of what kind of great power China will be and
[of **how the US will play its role as the guardian of the international
system**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}" By exten- sion, [[how the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates and
its allies [[treat Taiwan is an **important indicator**]{.mark} **[of
what other countries]{.mark} in the region [can expect]{.mark} from
Washington** [as the PRC]{.mark}'s influ- ence [expands]{.mark}. They
may ask, [if the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [acqui-
esces]{.mark} to a rising China on the Taiwan issue, [will it also
acquiesce on issues important to them?]{.mark}]{.underline}
