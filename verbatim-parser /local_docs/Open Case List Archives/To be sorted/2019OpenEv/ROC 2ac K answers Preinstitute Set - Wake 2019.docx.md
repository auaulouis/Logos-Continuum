### 2ac discourse doesn't shape reality

#### Discourse isn't the primary shaper of reality \-\-- material change from the plan outweighs \-\-- internal link turns reps

Thierry **Balzacq 5**, Professor of Political Science and IR @ Namar
University, "The Three Faces of Securitization: Political Agency,
Audience and Context" European Journal of International Relations,
London: Jun 2005, Volume 11, Issue 2

However, despite important insights, this position remains highly
disputable. The reason behind this qualification is not hard to
understand. With great trepidation my contention is that one of the main
distinctions we need to take into account while examining securitization
is that between \'institutional\' and \'brute\' threats. In its attempts
to follow a more radical approach to security problems wherein threats
are institutional, that is, mere products of communicative relations
between agents, the CS has neglected the importance of \'external or
brute threats\', that is, [[threats]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[**do not
depend** on language]{.mark} mediation [to be]{.mark} what
they]{.underline} are - [[hazards for human life]{.underline}]{.mark}.
In methodological terms, however, any framework over-emphasizing either
institutional or brute threat risks losing sight of important aspects of
a multifaceted phenomenon. Indeed, securitization, as suggested earlier,
is successful when the securitizing agent and the audience reach a
common structured perception of an ominous development. In this scheme,
there is no security problem except through the language game.
Therefore, [how problems are \'out there\' is]{.underline} exclusively
[contingent upon how we linguistically depict them]{.underline}. [This
is **not always true**]{.underline}. For one, [[**language does not
construct reality**; at best, it shapes]{.underline}]{.mark} our
[**[perception]{.underline}** [of it.]{.underline}]{.mark} Moreover,
[[it is not]{.mark} **theoretically [useful]{.mark}** [nor]{.mark} is it
[**empirically credible** to hold]{.mark} that [what we say about a
problem would determine]{.mark} its **[essence]{.mark}**. For instance,
**[what I say about a typhoon would not change
it]{.mark}**]{.underline}s essence. The consequence of this position,
which would require a deeper articulation, is that some security
problems are the attribute of the development itself. In short,
[[threats are]{.underline}]{.mark} not only [[**institutional**;
some]{.underline}]{.mark} of them [can]{.underline} actually
[[wreck]{.mark} entire political [communities **regardless of**]{.mark}
**the use of [language]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Analyzing security
problems then becomes a matter of understanding how external contexts,
including [[external **objective** developments, affect
securitization]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thus, far from being a departure
from constructivist approaches to security, external developments are
central to it.

### 2ac china reps

#### Assessing Chinese motivation is possible and prevents security dilemmas

Joseph K. **Clifton 11**, "DISPUTED THEORY AND SECURITY POLICY:
RESPONDING TO "THE RISE OF CHINA"," 2011,
http://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1164&context=cmc_theses

First, **[[motives can be known]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Mearsheimer is
correct in observing that **[[assessing]{.mark} motives [can be
difficult, but]{.mark} this does [not]{.mark} mean]{.underline}** that
the task is [**[impossible]{.underline}**.
**[There]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[clearly [are ways of finding
out]{.mark} information about the [goals of
states]{.mark}]{.underline}** and the means with which they plan to
achieve them. One of the most important roles of intelligence analysts,
for example, is to determine state interests and expected behavior based
on obtained information. [**[The]{.underline}**
**[possibility]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[that [info]{.mark}rmation [may
be flawed should]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[not lead to a rejection of
all info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline}**. **[People make decisions based
on less than perfect knowledge all of the time]{.underline}**. This
ability to know motives extends to future motives, because **[an analyst
can use]{.underline}** information such as historical **[trends to
observe]{.underline}** consistencies or constant **[evolutions of
motives]{.underline}**. **[Prediction of the future is necessarily less
certain in its accuracy, but the prediction can still be
made]{.underline}**.104¶ Second, even if there is still some uncertainty
of motives, the rational response is not to assume absolute aggression.
Assuming aggressive motive in a situation of uncertainty ignites the
security dilemma, which could actually decrease a state's security.
Mearsheimer calls this tragic, but it is not necessary. An illustrative
example is Mearsheimer's analysis of the German security situation were
the United States to withdraw its military protection. Mearsheimer
argues that it would be rational for Germany to develop nuclear weapons,
since these weapons would provide a deterrent, and it would also be
rational for nuclear European powers to wage a preemptive war against
Germany to prevent it from developing a nuclear deterrent. 105 This
scenario is not rational for either side because it ignores motives. If
Germany knows that other states will attack if it were to develop
nuclear weapons, then it would not be rational for it to develop nuclear
weapons. And if other states know that Germany's development of nuclear
weapons is only as a deterrent, then it would not be rational to prevent
German nuclear development. The point is that [**[the security dilemma
exists because of a]{.underline}** **[lack of motivational
knowledge]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[,]{.underline}** **[[so]{.mark} [the
]{.mark}]{.underline}**proper **[[response is to]{.mark} try
to]{.underline}** [**[enhance understanding of motives,]{.underline}**
**[not discard motivational knowledge]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[altogether]{.underline}**. **[Misperception is]{.underline}**
certainly **[a problem in international politics, but reducing
misperception would allow states to better conform to
defensive]{.underline}** realist **[logic, which results
in]{.underline}** **[preferable outcomes]{.underline}** relative to
offensive realism. 106¶ **[[Assessing motives is vital in the case
of]{.mark} the rise of [China]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[because
[mutually preferable outcomes]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[can be
achieved]{.underline}**]{.mark} if China is not an aggressive power, as
offensive realism would have to assume, but is actually a status quo
power with aims that have limited effect on the security of the U.S. and
other potentially affected countries. **[I do not mean]{.underline}**
here to claim **[with certainty that China is and will always be a
status quo power]{.underline}**, **[and policymakers likely have access
to more intentional information than what is publicly
known]{.underline}**. At the very least, valuing **[[motivational
assessments empower]{.underline}]{.mark}**s
[**[policymakers]{.underline}** **[to act]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[on
this knowledge, [which is]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[preferable because
of the possibility of]{.underline}** **[reducing]{.underline}**
]{.mark}competition and **[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### Assessing China war scenarios are good -- key to sound policymaking even if it's not the most realistic

**Goldstein 13** (Avery, David M. Knott Professor of Global Politics and
International Relations and Director of the Center for the Study of
Contemporary China at the University of Pennsylvania, Senior Fellow at
the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia, Published in
*International Security*, Vol. 37, No. 4 (Spring 2013), pp. 49--89)

**[Two concerns have driven]{.underline}** much of **[the debate about
international security in the post--Cold War era. The first is
the]{.underline}** potentially **[deadly mix of nuclear proliferation,
rogue states, and international terrorists]{.underline}**, a worry that
became dominant after the terrorist attacks against the United States on
September 11, 2001.1 **[The second concern]{.underline}**, one whose
prominence has waxed and waned since the mid-1990s, **[is the
potentially disruptive impact that China will have if it emerges as a
peer competitor of the United States, challenging an international order
established during the era of U.S. preponderance]{.underline}**.2
Rejecting this second concern, some **[analysts have expressed
reservations]{.underline}** about the dominant post--September 11
security agenda, **[arguing that China could challenge U.S. global
interests in ways that terrorists and rogue states
cannot]{.underline}**. In this article, **[I raise a more pressing
issue, one to which not enough attention has been paid.]{.underline}**
For at least the next decade, while China remains relatively weak,
**[[the gravest danger in Sino-American relations is the possibility the
two countries will find themselves in a crisis that could escalate to
open military conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

In contrast to the long-term prospect of a new great power rivalry
between the United States and China, which ultimately rests on debatable
claims about the intentions of the two countries and uncertain forecasts
about big shifts in their national capabilities, **[[the danger of
instability in a crisis involving these two nuclear-armed states is a
tangible, near-term concern]{.underline}]{.mark}**.3 **[[Even if the
probability]{.underline}]{.mark}** of such a war-threatening crisis and
its escalation to the use of significant military force **[[is low,
the]{.mark} potentially [catastrophic consequences]{.mark} of this
scenario [provide good reason]{.mark} for analysts [to better
understand]{.mark} its [dynamics and]{.mark} for [policymakers to fully
consider]{.mark} its [implications]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Moreover,
events since 2010---especially those relevant to disputes in the East
and South China Seas---suggest that **[[the danger of a
military]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[confrontation]{.underline}]{.mark}**
in the Western Pacific **[[that could lead to a U.S.-China standoff may
be on the rise]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### Pan concedes our reps aren't the cause of war

**Pan 12** (Chengxin Pan, Senior Lecturer in International Relations at
Deakin University, PhD, Political Science and IR from Peking University,
November 2012, "Knowledge, Desire and Power in Global Politics: Western
Representations of China\'s Rise," Edward Elgar Publishing)

**[[Despite the]{.mark} powerful [effect of the \'China threat\']{.mark}
paradigm [on policy-making,]{.mark} we must acknowledge that [the
\'threat\' representation is not the only contributing
factor]{.mark}.]{.underline}** To the extent that international
relations are interactively constructed, **[the [hardline China
policy]{.mark} in the US [is]{.mark} in part [constituted by
China\'s]{.mark} strategic [behaviour]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For
example, **[[the concept of AirSea Battle\']{.mark} (developed by the
Washington-based Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments and now
seriously entertained [by the Pentagon]{.mark} as a part of a broader
strategy of dealing with China) [might be seen as]{.mark} a
[necessary]{.mark} response [to Beijing\'s growing A2/AD
capabilities]{.mark},61 [rather than a pure brainchild of the \'China
threat\" discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Yet, equally, even as we turn
attention to Chinese capabilities and behaviour in global politics, we
must not lose sight of the constitutive role of the \'China threat\*
paradigm in the development of Chinese worldviews and strategic
behaviour in the first instance. For example, the growth of China s
A2/AD capabilities cannot possibly take place in an international
vacuum, rather, they can themselves be seen as responses to still
earlier Western policies on China, policies which are inevitably shaped
by the \'China threat\' perception In this section, I will examine how
some key- indicators of the China threat, such as jingoistic Chinese
nationalism, realpolitik thinking, and assertive foreign policy, can be
understood not as inherent Chinese traits, but as social constructs
courtesy of the China threat\' theory as practice.

#### Pan is reductionist and the alt fails --- can never generate a meaningful relationship with China.

**Jones 14** --- David Martin Jones, Professor of Politics at University
of Glasgow, PhD from LSE, Australian Journal of Political Science,
February 21, 2014, 49:1, \"Managing the China Dream: Communist Party
politics after the Tiananmen incident \", Taylor and Francis Online

Notwithstanding this Western fascination with China and the positive
response of former Marxists, such as Jacques, to the new China, **[Pan
discerns an Orientalist ideology distorting Western commentary on the
party state]{.underline}**, and especially its international relations
(6). Following Edward Said, **[Pan claims]{.underline}** that **[such
Western Orientalism reveals 'not something concrete about the orient,
but something about the orientalists themselves]{.underline}**, their
recurring latent desire of fears and fantasies about the orient' (16).
In order to unmask the limits of Western representations of China's
rise, Pan employs a critical 'methodology' that 'draws on constructivist
and deconstructivist approaches' (9). Whereas the 'former questions the
underlying dichotomy of reality/knowledge in Western study of China's
international relations', the latter shows how paradigmatic
representations of China 'condition the way we give meaning to that
country' and 'are socially constitutive of it' (9). **[[Pan
maintains]{.mark} that [the]{.mark} two [paradigms of 'China threat' and
'China opportunity' in Western discourse shape China's
reality]{.mark}]{.underline}** for Western 'China watchers' (3). These
discourses, Pan claims, are 'ambivalent' (65). He contends that this
'bifocal representation of China, like Western discourses of China more
generally, tell us a great deal about the west itself, its self
-imagination, its torn, anxious, subjectivity, as well as its discursive
effects of othering' (65). **[[This is a large
claim]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Interestingly]{.underline}**, [**[Pan
fails to note]{.underline}** **[that after]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the
[Tiananmen]{.mark} incident]{.underline}** in 1989, **[[Chinese]{.mark}
new left [scholarship]{.mark}]{.underline}** also **[[embraced Said's
critique]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Orientalism in order **[[to
reinforce]{.underline}]{.mark}** both **[[the party state
and]{.underline}]{.mark}** a **[burgeoning]{.underline}** sense of
**[[Chinese nationalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. To counter Western
liberal discourse, academics associated with **[[the Central
Party]{.mark} School [promoted]{.mark} an ideology of [Occidentalism to
deflect]{.mark} domestic and international [pressure to
democratise]{.mark} China]{.underline}**. In this, they drew not only
upon Said, but also upon Foucault and the post-1968 school of French
radical thought that, as Richard Wolin has demonstrated, was itself
initiated in an appreciation of Mao's cultural revolution. In other
words, the critical and deconstructive methodologies that came to
influence American and European social science from the 1980s had a
Maoist inspiration (Wolin 2010: 12--18). **[Subsequently, in the changed
circumstances of the]{.underline}** 19**[90s]{.underline}**, as American
sinologist Fewsmith has shown, young **[[Chinese scholars]{.mark}
'adopted a variety of postmodernist and critical
methodologies']{.underline}** (2008: 125). **[Paradoxically, these
scholars]{.underline}**, such as Wang Hui and Zhang Kuan (Wang 2011),
**[had been [educated in the USA]{.mark} and were familiar with
fashionable academic criticism of a postmodern and deconstructionist hue
that 'demythified' the West]{.underline}** (Fewsmith 2008: 125--29).
**[This approach]{.underline}**, promulgated in the academic journal
Dushu (Readings), **[deconstructed, via Said]{.underline}** and
Foucault, **[Western narratives about China]{.underline}**. Zhang Kuan,
in particular, rejected Enlightenment values **[and [saw
postmodern]{.mark}]{.underline}** critical **[[theory as a method to
build up]{.mark} a national 'discourse of resistance' and
[counter]{.mark} Western [demands regarding]{.mark} issues such as
[human rights]{.mark}]{.underline}** and intellectual property. **[It is
[through its affinity with this
self-strengthening]{.mark}]{.underline}**, Occidentalist
**[[lens,]{.mark} that [Pan's]{.mark} critical [study should]{.mark}
perhaps [be critically read]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Simply put, **[Pan
identifies a political economy of fear and desire that informs and
complicates Western foreign policy and]{.underline}**, **[Pan
asserts]{.underline}**, **[tells us more about the West's
'self-imagination' than it does about Chinese reality. Pan attempts to
sustain this claim via]{.underline}** an **[analysis]{.underline}**, in
Chapter 5, **[of the self-fulfilling prophecy]{.underline}** of the
China threat, followed, in Chapters 6 and 7, by exposure of the false
promises and premises of the China 'opportunity'. Pan certainly offers a
provocative insight into Western attitudes to China and their impact on
Chinese political thinking. In particular, he demonstrates that China's
foreign policy-makers react negatively to what they view as a hostile
American strategy of containment (101). In this context, **[[Pan
contends]{.mark}, accurately, that [Sino--US relations are mutually
constitutive]{.mark}]{.underline}** and the USA must take some
responsibility for the rise of China threat (107). **[[This]{.mark}
latter [point, however, is one]{.mark}]{.underline}** that Australian
**[[realists]{.underline}]{.mark}** like Owen Harries, whom Pan cites
approvingly, **[[have made consistently since the]{.mark}
late]{.underline}** 19**[[90s]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In other words,
**[[not all Western analysis uncritically endorses the view]{.mark} that
[China's rise is threatening. Nor is all Western perception]{.mark} of
this rise [reducible to the threat scenario advanced by]{.mark} recent
[US administrations]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Pan's]{.underline}**
subsequent **[argument that the China opportunity thesis leads to
inevitable disappointment]{.underline}** and subtly reinforces the China
threat paradigm **[is]{.underline}**, also, somewhat
**[misleading]{.underline}**. On the one hand, Pan notes that Western
anticipation of 'China's transformation and democratization' has 'become
a burgeoning cottage industry' (111). Yet, on the other hand, Pan
observes that Western commentators, such as Jacques, demonstrate a
growing awareness that the democratisation thesis is a fantasy. That is,
Pan, like Jacques, argues that China 'will neither democratize nor
collapse, but may instead remain politically authoritarian and
economically stable at the same time' (132). **[[To merge, as Pan does,
the democratisation thesis into its authoritarian
antithesis]{.underline}]{.mark}** in order **[to evoke 'present Western
disillusionment']{.underline}** (132) with China
**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** somewhat [**[reductionist]{.underline}**.
**[Pan's contention]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[that [we need a new
paradigm]{.mark} shift 'to free ourselves]{.underline}** from the
positivist aspiration to grand theory or transcendental scientific
paradigm itself' (157) **[[might be admirable, but this will not be
achieved by]{.mark} a [constructivism that would ultimately meet with
the approval of]{.mark}]{.underline}** what Brady terms **[[China's
thought managers]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Brady: 6).

Although they supported a moderate form of nationalism, many of
**[[China's leading IR experts were strongly attracted to]{.mark} the
view that it should [play a supportive and responsible role in the
international system.]{.mark} This was seen as vital for both China's
national and international interests.]{.underline}** Given their belief
that China's strength was over-rated, and that it should therefore
pursue its goals with greater sensitivity and less haste, **[they
tended]{.underline}** not unexpectedly **[to emphasize the benefits to
China of enhancing its international relationships within a cooperative
framework.]{.underline}** Qin Yaqing was one of the strongest advocates
of internationalism. He argued for a new form of pluralistic global

A Largely Demilitarized Taiwan Strait

Arguably, **[a Sino-U.S. confrontation over Taiwan, more than any other
hotspot]{.underline}** in the Western Pacific, **[has the potential to
escalate to a direct military conflict of major
proportions]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[this constitutes the most likely
potential trigger for an outright war]{.underline}** between the two
powers. As countless experts and pundits have observed, despite
ever-closer cross-strait economic ties and people-to-people contacts and
a long, recent period of positive cross-strait relations under former
Taiwan president Ma Ying-jeou, **[the combination of growing sentiment
on Taiwan against reunification]{.underline}** (under almost any
conditions), **[continued U.S. political and military
support]{.underline}** for the island, **[and China's growing military
and economic strength could significantly increase the potential for
future crises. These could arise over tension-producing political events
on Taiwan or the mainland or as a result either of a much stronger
China's refusal to accept future U.S. arms sales]{.underline}** to the
island **[or the emergence of a new pattern of Taiwan politics dominated
by pro-independence elements]{.underline}**. In fact,
**[the]{.underline}** recent **[2016 election]{.underline}** by a large
margin of members of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party
to both the Taiwan presidency and the Legislative Yuan **[suggests that
cross-strait relations might become more turbulent in the near future,
as cross-strait relations languish and especially if Beijing becomes
significantly less confident in the prospects for eventual
reunification]{.underline}**. And such increased turbulence is
particularly likely to become a long-term problem if this election
portends a fundamental long-term weakening of the pro--One China
Nationalist Party (Guomindang), as many observers believe.16

**[Without a more stable long-term modus vivendi between China, Taiwan,
and the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, **[any future
balance of power in the Western Pacific will quite likely remain
precarious, if not significantly unstable]{.underline}**. Unfortunately,
such an arrangement is unlikely to involve any kind of major political
breakthrough across the strait, whether in the direction of peaceful
unification or a peaceful transition to de jure Taiwan independence.
**[As long as Beijing remains committed to reunifying]{.underline}** the
island with mainland China, **[Taipei remains opposed to entering into
talks]{.underline}** with Beijing on the political status of the
islands, **[and Washington remains committed to providing]{.underline}**
the island with a level of **[political and military support that
permits such opposition, it is hard to imagine that]{.underline}** such
**[a breakthrough will occur, even if cross-strait]{.underline}**
economic and people-to-people **[ties deepen
significantly]{.underline}**. Hence the most that can be achieved, and
**[what would]{.underline}** most likely **[be necessary to ensure a
reasonably stable balance of power]{.underline}**, **[is the elimination
or]{.underline}**, failing that, the **[significant reduction of the
Taiwan issue as a major source of security competition between the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and China. This would
require]{.underline}** at best the **[demilitarization and political
stabilization of the]{.underline}** existing uneasy
**[dynamic]{.underline}**, **[via a more explicit understanding of
restraint between Beijing and Washington over arms deployments
and]{.underline}** \[end page 88\] a possible future **[use of
force]{.underline}**. Failing that, **[at the very least, it would
require more comprehensive CBMs and tacit understandings designed to
reduce the potential for a dangerous use of force. This would most
likely include assurances to Beijing that Taiwanese independence will
not occur without Beijing's approval and to Washington that Beijing will
not employ force against the island in the absence of clear Taiwanese
attempts to achieve permanent separation]{.underline}** from the
mainland.

### 2ac econ predictions

#### Economic predictions accurate -- using it is a productive tool

**Avent 11** (Ryan, author of The Gated City, "Economic Science"
3/17//11, The Bellows) <http://www.ryanavent.com/blog/?p=2380>

Is economics a science? Let me first associate myself with Adam Ozimek's
comments here. If you want to say that economics isn't a "hard science",
that might be all right, depending on just what you mean by it. If you
mean that economists can't run lab experiments and can't predict
outcomes as accurately as, say, chemists, then that's acceptable to me.
**[If you mean that economists have no experiments, or don't use the
scientific method, or something of that nature, then you're dead wrong.
The currency of the economics realm is evidence. [When economists do
research they form hypotheses, build models, gather data, test the
models]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[against the data, [and publish their
conclusions. If other economists]{.mark} try to get similar results and
[fail, the original result is called into question. Economics is]{.mark}
quite [often effectively predictive. If]{.mark} the [supply]{.mark} of
one good]{.underline}** **[[is disrupted, economists can tell you with
great certainty what will happen]{.mark} to demand for complementary
goods and substitutes.]{.underline}** If supply levels are known and
research establishing elasticities has been done, they can tell you even
more about what will happen**[[. Their predictions will nearly always be
right]{.mark}.]{.underline}** And **[[this is true for many
aspects]{.mark} of economics.]{.underline}** It's important to note that
because economists can't always run their own experiments, there will
tend to be more confidence about theories that focus on things which
occur very often. Prices shift constantly, and economists consequently
know a LOT about prices. Massive, global economic recessions occur about
once a century. There is obviously a lot more uncertainty regarding the
theories that describe these events. Economics struggles with limited
data at times. Economists could substantially increase their
macroeconomic sample sizes if they had good data on economic activity
for all of human history, but unfortunately governments haven't been
collecting data all that long. (Though economic historians have put
together respectable careers carefully assembling historical data sets.)

#### Economic predictions are accurate and can improve

1\. Economic Predictions. Much of Rosenberg\'s discussion is directed
toward explaining **[the \"predictive weakness\"]{.underline}** (p. 297)
**[of modem economics and the discipline\'s inability]{.underline}** (or
lack of desire) **[to \"improve its predictive content\"]{.underline}**
(p. 301). **[This failure to generate successful predictions and to
improve the few predictions]{.underline}** which are made is taken as an
empirical fact about even the most applied economic theories.
**[No]{.underline}** **[evidence is provided, or even suggested, to
support this empirical claim]{.underline}**. Rosenberg certainly needs
to provide evidence for the ubiquitous predictive failure of applied
economic theory. Such **[criticism is by no means \"well known\" or
\"standard\" in the literature on economic methodology]{.underline}**.
It is \"standard\" to argue that economic theories are insulated from
direct falsification that they are built on inadequate behavioral
foundations and that in their most abstract form they fail to yield
predictions or even to systematically connect up with applied theories
which might yield pre- dictions**[.]{.underline}** **[But]{.underline}**
**[systematic predictive failure is not a standard methodological
criticism of applied economic theory]{.underline}**. T**[he reason why
such predictive failure is not a standard criticism is quite
simple:]{.underline}** Rosenberg has **[exaggerated the extent of this
failure. Predictive failure is simply not the ubiquitous fact of modem
economic theory]{.underline}** which Rosenberg
assumes**[.]{.underline}** While nowhere near the standards of the best
natural science**[, applied economic theories]{.underline}** (both micro
and macro) **[do generate an ocean of successful
predictions]{.underline}**, on **[everything from the impact of trucking
deregulation to the demand for consumer credit]{.underline}**.
Rosenberg\'s **[claim that economic predictions have not
\"improved\"]{.underline}** (p. 301) **[with time is also
exaggerated]{.underline}**. While **[there is always room for more
improvement, modem macro econometric models provide extraordinary
accuracy relative to pre-World War I1 business cycle models. Where
substantial errors do occur, such as the inability to predict the
inflationary impact of the OPEC induced supply-side
shock,]{.underline}** the **[models are improved so that failures of the
same type are less likely to reoccur]{.underline}**.3 Rosenberg even
goes so far as to argue that more predictively **[successful
alternatives currently exist]{.underline}** (at least in the micro
domain) **[and are neglected, ostensibly because of an irrational
professional attraction to intentional and extremal views of human
behavior]{.underline}**. He tells us that even if a **[more predictive
theory were available: \"it is not likely to actually deflect practicing
economists from their intentional extremal research program . . . the
reason is that they are not really much interested in
questions]{.underline}**. Readers of earlier drafts of this paper noted
that while Rosenberg is faulted for not providing specific examples of
\"failure,\" **[the above discussion does not provide specific examples
of \"success.\" Examples of success abound in any copy of an applied
economics journal, a Federal Reserve Bulletin, or any other publication
specializing in applied economics.]{.underline}**

can't]{.mark} afford to [reject interventions]{.mark} simply [because
they don't meet our ideal conceptions]{.mark}** of how things should
be.]{.underline} **[[We have to work with the world that is
here]{.mark}, not the one that we would like to be here]{.underline}**.
And here it's crucial to note that **[pointing this out does not entail
that we shouldn't work for producing that other world.]{.underline}**
**[It just means that we have to grapple with the world that is actually
there before us.]{.underline}**¶ It pains me to write this post because
I remember, with great bitterness, the diatribes hardcore Obama
supporters leveled against legitimate leftist criticisms on the grounds
that these critics were completely unrealistic idealists who, in their
demand for "purity", were asking for "ponies and unicorns". This
rejoinder always seemed to ignore that words have power and that
**[Obama, through his profound power of rhetoric, had]{.underline}**, at
least **[the power to shift public debates and frames, opening a path to
making new forms of policy and new priorities possible.]{.underline}**
**[The tragedy was that he didn't use that power,]{.underline}** though
he has gotten better.¶ I do not wish to denounce others and dismiss
their claims on these sorts of grounds. As a Marxist anarchists, **[I do
believe that we should fight for]{.underline}** the creation of **[an
alternative]{.underline}** hominid **[ecology]{.underline}** **[or
social world.]{.underline}** I think that the call to commit and fight,
to put alternatives on the table, has been one of the most powerful
contributions of thinkers like Zizek and Badiou. If we don't commit and
fight for alternatives those alternatives will never appear in the
world. **[Nonetheless, we still have to grapple with the world we find
ourselves in]{.underline}**. And **[it is here, in my encounters with
some Militant Marxists, that I sometimes find it difficult to avoid the
conclusion that they are]{.underline}** unintentionally **[aiding and
abetting the very things they claim to be fighting]{.underline}**.
**[[In their refusal]{.mark} to become impure, [to work with
situations]{.mark} or assemblages [as we find them]{.mark}, to sully
their hands, [they end up reproducing the very system they wish to
topple]{.mark}]{.underline}** and change**[. Narcissistically they get
to sit there, smug in their superiority and purity, while everything
continues as it did before [because they've refused to]{.mark} become
politicians or [engage]{.mark} in the difficult concrete work of
assembling]{.underline}** human and nonhuman **[[actors to render
another world possible]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As a consequence,
**[they]{.underline}** occupy the position of Hegel's beautiful soul
that **[denounces the horrors of the world, celebrate the beauty of
their soul, [while depending on those horrors]{.mark} of the world [to
sustain their own position]{.mark}. ¶]{.underline}** To engage in
politics is to engage in networks or ecologies of relations between
humans and nonhumans. To engage in ecologies is to descend into networks
of causal relations and feedback loops that you cannot completely master
and that will modify your own commitments and actions. But there's no
other way, there's no way around this, and we do need to act now.

#### Globalization's inevitable and necessary

**Barnhizer 6** (law professor at Cleveland State University (David,
Georgetown International Environmental Law Review, "Waking from
Sustainability\'s \"Impossible Dream\": The Decisionmaking Realities of
Business and Government",
http://www.allbusiness.com/human-resources/employee-development-leadership/4077913-1.html)

[[The scale of]{.underline}]{.mark} social [[needs]{.underline}]{.mark},
including the need for expanded productive activity, [[has grown so
large that it cannot be shut off]{.underline}]{.mark} at all, and
certainly not abruptly. It cannot even be ratcheted down in any
significant fashion without producing serious harms to human societies
and hundreds of millions of people. [[Even if it were possible to
shift]{.mark} back [to]{.mark}]{.underline} systems of [local
[self-sufficiency, the]{.mark} consequences of the
[transition]{.mark}]{.underline} process [[would be
catastrophic]{.underline}]{.mark} for many people and even deadly to the
point of continual conflict, resource wars, increased poverty, and
strife. [[What are needed]{.mark} [are concrete]{.mark}]{.underline},
workable, and pragmatic [[strategies that produce]{.underline}]{.mark}
effective and [intelligently designed [economic
activity]{.mark}]{.underline} in specific contexts and, while seeking
efficiency and conservation, place economic and social justice high on a
list of priorities.60

Many developing country groups involved in efforts to protect the
environment and resist the impacts of free trade on their communities
have been concerned with the harmful effects of economic change. Part of
the concern is the increased scale of economic activity. [Some [concerns
relate to who benefits and who loses]{.mark} in the changing context
imposed by globalization. [These]{.mark} concerns [are
legitimate]{.mark}]{.underline} and understandable. So are the other
deep currents running beneath their political positions, including those
of resistance to change of any kind and a rejection of the market
approach to economic activities. In the system described inaccurately as
free market capitalism, economic activity not only breaks down existing
systems, it creates new systems and-as Joseph Schumpeter
observed-continually repeats the process through cycles of \"creative
destruction.\"61 This pattern of [creative destruction unfolds
as]{.underline} necessarily and [relentlessly as does the]{.underline}
birth-maturation-[death]{.underline}-rebirth [cycle]{.underline} of the
natural environment. [[This occurs even in a]{.mark} self-sufficient or
[autarkic market]{.mark}]{.underline} system [capable of managing all
variables]{.underline} within its closed dominion. But when the system
breaks out of its closed environment, the ability of a single national
actor to control the system\'s dynamics erodes and ultimately disappears
in the face of differential conditions, needs, priorities, and agendas.

[[Globalization\'s ability to produce wealth]{.underline}]{.mark} for a
particular group simultaneously [[produces harms to different
people]{.underline}]{.mark} and interests and generates unfair resource
redistribution within existing cultures. This is an unavoidable
consequence of globalization.62 The problem is that globalization has
altered the rules of operation of political, economic, and social
activities, and in doing so multiplied greatly our ability to create
benefit and harm.63 While some understandably want the unsettling and
often chaotic effects of globalization to go away, [[it can only be
dealt with, not reversed. The system]{.underline}]{.mark} in which we
live and work [[is no longer closed]{.underline}]{.mark}. There are few
contexts not connected to the dynamics of some aspect of the extended
economic and social systems resulting from globalization. This means the
[wide ranging and [incompatible variables of]{.mark}]{.underline} a
global economic, human rights, and [[social
fairness]{.underline}]{.mark} system [[are resulting in
conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark} and unanticipated interpenetrations that
no one fully understands, anticipates, or controls.64 [Local
[self-sufficiency is the loser in this process. It can remain a]{.mark}
nostalgic [dream but rarely a reality]{.mark}.]{.underline} Except for
isolated cultures and niche activities, there is very little chance that
anyone will be unaffected by this transformational process. Change is
the constant, and it will take several generations before we return to a
period of relative stasis. Even then it will only be a respite before
the pattern once again intensifies.

commitment is what impelled Ava DuVernay to make the seemingly
gratuitous move of falsifying Martin Luther King Jr's relationship with
the Johnson administration around the Selma campaign: "I wasn't
interested in making a white savior movie," she replied to critics, "I
was interested in making a movie centered on the people of Selma."∂ Of
course, she doesn't do the latter either, but her commitment to not
"making a white savior movie" also led her to misconstrue the tension
between the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference in Selma, which stemmed precisely from
the SNCC activists' objection that King and his organization maintained
secret, backdoor dealings with the Johnson administration.∂ **[The
[psychobabbling]{.mark} bromides that elevate recognition and

**[the newly confected category of the Black Public

was that its avatars **[were]{.underline}** quite specifically **[not

By now it has begun to dawn that one of the subjects of this class
session is how lawyers translate their moral intuitions and sense of
justice into legal arguments. [Most]{.underline} beginning [students
have found themselves in the situation of wanting to express
their]{.underline} **[moral intuitions]{.underline}** [in the form of
legal arguments]{.underline} [but of feeling powerless to do
so]{.underline}. [A common attitude of]{.underline} Northeastern
[students is that a lawyer]{.underline} **[cannot turn moral and
political convictions into legal arguments]{.underline}** in the context
of case-litigation. [[If you are interested in]{.underline}]{.mark}
directly [[pursuing a moral]{.mark} and/or political
[agenda]{.mark}]{.underline}, at a minimum [[you need to take
up]{.underline}]{.mark} [legislative and [policy
work]{.mark}]{.underline}, and more likely you need to leave the law
altogether and take up grass roots organizing instead. I insist that we
keep the focus on litigation for this class period. After the straw
poll, I ask the students to simulate the role of Staughton Lynd‟s legal
assistants and to assume that the court has just definitively rejected
the claims based on contract, promissory estoppel, and the notion of a
community property right. However, they should also assume,
counter-factually, that Judge Lambros stayed dismissal of the suit for
ten days to give plaintiffs one last opportunity to come up with a
theory. I charge the students with the task of making a convincing
common law argument, supported by respectable legal authority, that the
plaintiffs were entitled to substantial relief. Put another way, I ask
the students to prove that Judge Lambros was mistaken---that he was
legally wrong---when he concluded that there was no basis in existing
law to vindicate the workers‟ and community‟s rights. In some classroom
exercises, I permit students to select the side for which they wish to
argue, but I do not allow that in this session. [All [students are asked
to **simulate the role**]{.mark}]{.underline} of plaintiffs‟ counsel
[and]{.underline} to **[make the best arguments they
can]{.underline}**---**[either because they]{.underline}** actually
**[believe]{.underline}** **[such arguments]{.underline}** **[and/or
[because in their simulated role]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[they are
fulfilling their]{.underline}]{.mark} ethical **[[duty to
provide]{.underline}]{.mark}** zealous
**[[representation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A recurring, instant reflex
is to say: "it‟s simple---the workers‟ human rights were violated in the
Youngstown case." I remind the class that the challenge I set was to
come up with a common law theory. The great appeal of human rights
discourse for today‟s students is that it seems to provide a technical
basis upon which their fervent moral and political commitments appear to
be legally required. "What human rights?" I ask. The usual answers are
(1) "they had a right to be treated like human beings" or (2) "surely
there is some human right on which they can base their case." To the
first argument I respond: "well, how they are entitled to be treated is
exactly what the court is called upon in this case to decide. Counsel
may not use a re-statement of the conclusion you wish the court to reach
as the legal basis supporting that conclusion." To the second response I
reply: "it would be nice if some recognized human right applied, but we
are in the Northern District of Ohio in 1980. Can you cite a pertinent
human rights instrument?" (Answer: "no.") The students then throw other
ideas on the table. Someone always proposes that U.S. Steel‟s actions
toward the community were "unconscionable." I point out that
unconscionability is a defense to contract enforcement whereas the
plaintiffs were seeking to enforce a contract (the alleged promise not
to close the plant if it were rendered profitable). In any case, we have
assumed that the judge has already ruled that there was no contract.
Another suggestion is that plaintiffs go for restitution. A restitution
claim arises when plaintiff gives or entrusts something of value to the
defendant, and the defendant wrongfully refuses to pay for or return it.
But here we are assuming that Judge Lambros has already ruled that the
workers did not endow U.S. Steel with any property or value other than
their labor power for which they were already compensated under the
applicable collective bargaining agreements. If the community provided
U.S. Steel with value in the nature of tax breaks or infrastructure
development, the effect of Judge Lambros‟ ruling on the property claim
is to say that these were not investments by the community but
no-strings-attached gifts given in the hope of attracting or retaining
the company‟s business. At this point I usually give a hint by saying,
"if we‟ve ruled out contract claims, and we‟ve ruled property claims,
what does that leave?" Aha, torts! A student then usually suggests that
U.S. Steel committed the tort of intentional infliction of emotional
distress (IIED).15 I point out that, even if it were successful, this
theory would provide plaintiffs relief only for their emotional
injuries, but not their economic or other losses, and most likely would
not provide a basis for an injunction to keep the plant open. In any
event, IIED is an intentional tort. What, I ask, is the evidence that
U.S. Steel intends the plant shutdown to cause distress? The response
that "they should know that emotional distress will result" is usually
not good enough to make out an intentional tort. An astute student will
point out that in some jurisdictions it is enough to prove that the
defendant acted with reckless disregard for the likelihood that severe
emotional distress would result. I allow that maybe there‟s something to
that, but then shift ground by pointing out that a prima facie
requirement of IIED is that the distress suffered go beyond what an
"ordinary person" may be expected to endure or beyond the bounds of
"civilized behavior."16 Everyone knows that plants close all the time
and that the distress accompanying job-loss is a normal feature of
American life. A student halfheartedly throws out negligent infliction
of emotional distress, to which my reply is: "In what way is U.S.
Steel‟s proposed conduct negligent? The problem we are up against here
is precisely that the corporation is acting as a rational
profit-maximizer." A student always proposes that plaintiffs should
allege that what U.S. Steel did was "against public policy." First of
all, I say, "public policy" is not a cause of action; it is a backdrop
against which conduct or contract terms are assessed. Moreover, what
public policy was violated in this case? The student will respond by
saying "it is against public policy for U.S. Steel to leave the
community devastated." I point out once again that that is the very
conclusion for which we are contending---it is circular argument to
assert a statement of our intended conclusion as the rationale for that
conclusion. This dialogue continues for awhile. [One ineffective theory
after another is put on the table]{.underline}. [Only once or twice in
the decades I have taught this exercise have the students gotten close
to a viable legal theory]{.underline}. **[But this is not wasted
time]{.underline}**---lear[n]{.underline}ing [occurs in]{.underline}
this phase of [the exercise]{.underline}. [The point conveyed
is]{.underline} that [while law and morals/politics are inextricably
intertwined]{.underline}, [they are not the same]{.underline}. For one
thing, [lawyers have a distinct way of talking about and analyzing
problems]{.underline} that is characteristic of the legal culture of a
given time and place. So-called "[legal reasoning]{.underline}" [is
actually a repertoire of **conventional**]{.underline}, **[culturally
approved rhetorical moves and counter-moves]{.underline}** [deployed by
lawyers]{.underline} to [create an appearance of]{.underline} the [legal
necessity]{.underline} of the results for which they contend. In
addition, [good lawyers]{.underline} actually [possess
**useful**]{.underline}, specialized [**knowledge not** generally
**absorbed by** political theorists or movement **activists**. [Legal
training **sensitizes us**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to the many
**complexities** that arise whenever general norms and principles are
implemented in the form of rules]{.underline}]{.mark} of decision [or
case applications]{.underline}. [Lawyers know]{.underline}, for example,
that **[[large stakes may turn on precisely how a right is
defined]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[who has standing]{.underline}** to
vindicate it, **[[what remedies it provides, how the right is
enforced]{.underline}]{.mark}** and in what venue(s), and so on. **[We
are not doing our jobs]{.underline}** properly **[if we
argue,]{.underline}** simply, "**[what the defendant did was unjust and
the plaintiff deserves relief]{.underline}**." No one needs a lawyer to
make the "what the defendant did was unjust" argument. As Lynd‟s account
shows, the workers of Youngstown did make that argument in their own,
eloquent words and through their collective resistance to the
shut-downs. [[If "what the defendant did was unjust" is all we have to
offer, **lawyers bring no added value to the table**]{.mark}**.**
Progressive students]{.underline} sometimes [tell
themselves]{.underline} that [law is]{.underline} basically
**[gobbledygook]{.underline}**, but that you can assist movements for
social change if you learn how to spout the right gobbledygook. In this
view of legal practice, "creativity" consists in identifying an
appropriate technicality that helps your client. But in the Youngstown
situation, we are way past that naïve view. There is no "technicality"
that can win the case. In this setting, [a social justice lawyer must
use the bits and pieces lying around to generate **new legal knowledge**
and **new legal theories**]{.underline}. And [these new theories must
say something]{.underline} [more than]{.underline} "**[my client
deserves to win]{.underline}**" (although it is fine to commence one‟s
research on the basis of that moral intuition). The class is beginning
to get frustrated, and around now someone says "well, what do you
expect? This is capitalism. There‟s no way the workers were going to
win." The "this-is-capitalism" ("TIC") statement sometimes comes from
the right, sometimes from the left, and usually from both ends of the
spectrum but in different ways. The TIC statement precipitates another
teachable moment. I begin by saying that we need to tease out exactly
what the student means by TIC, as several interpretations are possible.
For example, TIC might be a prediction of what contemporary courts are
most likely to do. That is, TIC might be equivalent to saying that "it
doesn‟t matter what theory you come up with; 999 US judges out of 1,000
would rule for U. S. Steel."17 I allow that this is probably true, but
not very revealing. The workers knew what the odds were before they
launched the case. **[Even if doomed to fail]{.underline}**, [[a legal
case **may still make a contribution to social
justice**]{.underline}]{.mark} if [the litigation creates a]{.underline}
**[focal point of energy around which a community can mobilize,
articulate moral and political claims, educate the wider public, and
conduct political consciousness-raising]{.underline}**. And if there is
political value in pursuing a case, we might as well make good legal
arguments. On an alternative reading, the TIC observation is more
ambitious than a mere prediction. It might be a claim that a capitalist
society requires a legal structure of a certain kind, and that therefore
professionally acceptable legal reasoning within capitalist legal
regimes cannot produce a theory that interrogates the status quo beyond
a certain point. Put another way, some outcomes are so foreign to the
bedrock assumptions of private ownership that they cannot be reached by
respectable legal reasoning. A good example of an outcome that is
incompatible with capitalism, so the argument goes, is a court order
interfering with U.S. Steel‟s decision to leave Youngstown. [This
reading of the TIC comment embodies]{.underline} [the idea]{.underline}
that [legal discourse]{.underline} is [encased within a
deeper]{.underline}, extra-legal [structure given by requirements
of]{.underline} the social order ([capitalism]{.underline}), [so that
within professionally responsible legal argument]{.underline} [the best
lawyers in the world could not state a winning theory]{.underline} in
Local 1330. Ironically, **[the left and the right in the class often
share this belief.]{.underline}** I take both conservative and
progressive students on about this. I insist that [[the]{.underline}
[claim]{.underline} that [our law is constrained by a]{.underline}
[**rigid** meta-logic]{.underline}]{.mark} [of
capitalism]{.underline}---which curiously parallels the notion that
legal outcomes are tightly constrained by legal
reasoning---**[[is]{.mark} just plain [wrong]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[Capitalist societies recognize]{.underline} all **[sorts of
limitations]{.underline}** [on the rights of property
owners]{.underline}. Professor Singer‟s classic article catalogues a
multitude of them.18 [The claim is **not only false**]{.underline},
**[it is a dangerous falsehood]{.underline}**. **[To believe TIC in this
sense is to limit in advance our aspirations for what social justice
lawyering can accomplish]{.underline}**. Now the class begins to sense
that I am not just playing law professor and asking rhetorical questions
to which there are no answers. The students realize that I actually
think that I have a theory up my sleeve that shows that Judge Lambros
was wrong on the law. If things are going well, the students begin to
feel an emotional stake in the exercise. Many who voted in the straw
poll that the plaintiffs deserved to win are anxious to see whether I
can pull it off. Other students probably engage emotionally for a
different reason---the ones who have been skeptical or derisive of my
approach all term hope that my "theory," when I eventually reveal it, is
so implausible that I will fall flat on my face. I begin to feed the
students more hints. One year I gave the hint, "What do straying
livestock, leaking reservoirs, dynamite blasting, and unsafe products
have in common?"---but that made it too easy. Usually my hints are more
oblique, as in "does anything you learned about accident law ring a
bell?" Whatever the form, the students take the hints, and some start
cooking with gas. Over the next few minutes, the pieces usually fall
into place. The legal theory toward which I have been steering the
students is that U.S. Steel is strictly liable in tort for the negative
social effects of its decision to disinvest in Youngstown. I contend
that that is what the law provided in Ohio in 1980, and therefore a
mechanism was available for the District Court to order substantial
relief. A basic, albeit contested theme of modern tort law, which all
students learn in first year, is that society allows numerous risky and
predictably harmful activities to proceed because we deem those
activities, on balance, to be worthwhile or necessary. In such cases,
the law often imposes liability rules designed to make the activity pay
for the injuries or accidents it inevitably causes. For more than a
century, tort rules have been fashioned to force actors to take account
of all consequences proximately attributable to their actions, so that
they will internalize the relevant costs and price their products
accordingly. The expectation is that in the ordinary course of business
planning, the actor will perform a cost/benefit analysis to make sure
that the positive values generated by the activity justify its costs.
Here, I remind the students of the famous Learned Hand Carroll Towing
formula19 comparing B vs. PL, where B represents the costs of accident
avoidance (or of refraining from the activity when avoidance is
impossible or too costly); and P x L (probability of the harm multiplied
by the gravity of the harm) reflects foreseeable accident costs.20 The
tort theory that evolved from this and similar cost/benefit approaches
is called "market deterrence." The notion is that liability rules should
be designed to induce the actor who is in the best position to conduct
this kind of cost/benefit analysis with respect to a given activity to
actually conduct it. Such actors will have incentives to make their
products and activities safer and/or to develop safer substitute
products and activities.21 Actors will then pass each activity‟s
residual accident costs on to consumers by "fractionating" and
"spreading" such costs through their pricing decisions. As a result,
prices will give consumers an accurate picture of the true social costs
of the activity, including its accident costs. Consumers are thus
enabled to make rational decisions about whether to continue purchasing
the product or activity in light of its accident as well as its
production costs. In principle, if a particular actor produces an unduly
risky product (in the sense that its accident costs are above "market
level"), that actor‟s products will be priced above market, and he/she
will be driven out of business.22 Tort rules have long been crafted with
an eye toward compelling risky but socially valuable activities or
enterprises to internalize their external costs. My examples---to which
the students were exposed in first year---are the ancient rule imposing
strict liability for crop damage caused by escaping livestock;23 strict
liability under the doctrine of Rylands v. Fletcher for the escape of
dangerous things brought onto one‟s property;24 strict liability under
Restatement (Second) § 519 for damage caused by "abnormally dangerous
activities" such as dynamite blasting;25 and most recently, strict
products liability.26 Of course, there are many exceptions to this
approach. For example, "unavoidably unsafe" or "Comment k products" are
deemed non-defective and therefore do not carry strict liability. And of
course the U.S. largely rejected Rylands. Why was that? Because, as was
memorably stated in Losee v. Buchanan: "We must have factories,
machinery, dams, canals and railroads. They are demanded by the manifold
wants of mankind, and lay at the basis of all our civilization."27 In
assuming that entrepreneurial capitalism would be stymied if enterprises
were obliged to pay for the harms they cause, the Losee court accepted a
strong version of TIC. Time permitting, I touch briefly on the debate
about whether the flourishing of the negligence principle in the U.S.
subsidized 19th century entrepreneurial capitalism,28 the possible
implications of the Coase Theorem for our discussion of Local 1330,29
and the debate about whether it is appropriate for courts to fashion
common law rules with an eye toward their distributive as well as
efficiency consequences.30 With this as background, I argue that the
District Court should have treated capital mobility---investors‟
circulation of capital in search of the highest rate of return---as a
risky but socially valuable activity warranting the same legal treatment
as straying cattle and dynamite blasting. Capital mobility is socially
valuable. It is indispensable for economic growth and flexibility.
Capital mobility generates important positive externalities for
"winners," such as economic development and job-creation at the new site
of investment. However, capital mobility also predictably causes
negative external effects on "bystanders" (the ones economists quaintly
label "the losers"). We discussed some of these externalities at the
outset of the class---the trauma associated with income interruption and
pre-mature retirement, waste or destruction of human capital, multiplier
effects on the local economy, and social pathologies and community
decline of the kind experienced in Youngstown. The plaintiffs should
have argued that capital mobility must internalize its social
dislocation costs for reasons of economic efficiency, and that this can
be accomplished by making investors strictly liable in tort for the
social dislocation costs proximately caused by their capital mobility
decisions. An investor considering shifting capital from one use to
another will compare their respective rates of return. In theory, the
investment with the higher return is socially optimal (as well as more
profitable for the individual investor). The higher-return investment
enlarges the proverbial pie. But investors must perform accurate
comparisons of competing investment opportunities in order for the magic
hand of the market to perform its magic. A rational investor bases her
analysis primarily on price signals reflecting estimated rates of return
on alternative investment options. This comparison will yield an
irrational judgment leading to a socially suboptimal investment decision
unless the estimated rate of return on the new investment reflects its
external effects, both positive and negative. Investors often have
public-relations incentives to tout the positive economic consequences
promised at the new location. To guarantee rational decision making, the
law must force investors contemplating withdrawal of capital from an
enterprise to also carefully consider the negative social dislocation
costs properly attributable to the activity of disinvestment. This can
be achieved by making capital mobility strictly liable for its
proximately caused social dislocation costs.31 This approach erects no
inefficient barriers to capital mobility, nor does it bar all
disinvestment decisions that may cause disruption and loss in the exit
community. Other things being equal, if the new investment discounted by
the social dislocation costs of exit will generate a higher rate of
return than the current use of the capital, the capital should be
disinvested from the old use and transferred to the new use. However, if
investors are not forced by liability rules to take into account the
social dislocation costs of disinvestment, the new investment
opportunity will appear more attractive than it really is in a social
sense. The situation involves a classic form of market failure. The
market is imperfect because investors are not obliged to take into
account the negative social dislocation costs proximately caused by
their decisions. Inaccurate price signals lead to the overproduction of
capital movement and therefore to a suboptimal allocation of resources.
Apart from any severance and unemployment benefits received by workers
at the old plant, the social dislocation costs of disinvestment are
almost entirely externalized onto the workers and the surrounding
community. Strict tort liability will induce investors and their
downstream customers to fractionate and spread the dislocation costs of
capital mobility when pricing the products of the new activity. This
will provide those who use or benefit from the new activity at the
destination community more accurate signals as to its true social costs
and oblige them to fractionally share in the misfortunes afflicting the
departure community. Suppose, for example, that U.S. Steel invested the
money it took out of Youngstown toward construction of a modern,
high-tech steel mill in a Sunbelt state. The price of steel produced at
the new mill should fractionally reflect social dislocation costs in
Youngstown. According to legal "common sense" and mainstream economic
theory, the movement of capital from a lesser to a more profitable
investment is an unambiguous social good. Allowing capital to migrate to
its highest rate of return guarantees that society‟s resources are
devoted to their most productive uses. Society as a whole is better off
if capital is permitted freely to migrate to the new investment and
there to grow the pie. In short, the free mobility of capital maximizes
aggregate welfare. We are all "winners" in the long run, even if some
unfortunate "losers" might get hurt along the way. It follows as an
article of faith that any legal inhibition on the mobility of capital is
inefficient and socially wasteful. This is why mainstream legal thinking
refuses to accord long-term workers or surrounding communities any sort
of "property interest" in the enterprise which a departing investor is
obliged to buy out before removal.32 An unwritten, bed-rock assumption
of US law is that capital is not and should not be legally responsible
for the social dislocation costs occasioned by its mobility.33 Such
costs are mostly externalized onto employees and the surrounding
community, even if the exit community had subsidized the old investment
with tax breaks and similar forms of corporate welfare. The legal common
sense about capital mobility is mistaken. It is not a priori true that
the movement of capital toward the greatest rate of return unambiguously
enhances aggregate social welfare. Free capital mobility maximizes
aggregate welfare and allocates resources to their most productive uses
only in a perfect market; that is, only in the absence of market
failure. The claim that free capital mobility is efficient is sometimes
true, and sometimes it is not. It all depends on the particular facts
and circumstances on the ground. Voilà. Judge Lambros was wrong. In
1980, a mechanism did exist in our law to recognize the plaintiffs‟
claims and afford them substantial relief for economic, emotional, and
other losses.34 All that was required was a logical extension of
familiar torts thinking. Had Judge Lambros correctly applied well-known
and time-honored torts principles, he would have treated the social
dislocation costs of the plant closure as an externality that must be
embedded in U.S. Steel‟s calculations regarding the relative
profitability of the old and new uses to which it might put its capital.
This would close the gap between private and social costs, thereby
tending to perfect the market. Notice an important rhetorical advantage
of this theory---its core value is economic efficiency. The plaintiffs
can get this far along in their argument without mentioning "fairness,"
"equity," or "justice," let alone "human rights," values that are often
fatal to legal argument in U.S. courts today.35 I now brace myself for
the "you gotta be kidding me" phase of the discussion. Objections
cascade in. The progressive students want to be convinced that this is
really happening. The mainstream students want to poke holes and debunk.
A few of them are grateful at last for an opportunity to show how
misguided they always knew my teaching was. Always, students assert that
my summary discussion of the cost/benefit analysis omitted various costs
and benefits. For example, one year I omitted to say that the social
dislocation costs in the exit community must be discounted by
ameliorative public expenditures such as unemployment insurance
benefits. My response to this type of objection is always the same: "you
are absolutely right, that cost or benefit should be included in the
analysis. And here are a few more considerations we would need to
address to perfect the cost/benefit analysis which I left out only in
the interest of time." But I learn from this discussion; not
infrequently, students contribute something I had not previously
considered. A frequent objection is that the task of quantifying the
social dislocation costs associated with capital mobility is just too
complicated and difficult. I concede that it is a complex task and that
conservative estimates might be required in place of absolute precision.
I ask, however, whether it is preferable to allow investors to proceed
on the basis of price-signals we know to be wrong or to induce them to
use best efforts to arrive at fair estimates. Separation of powers
always comes up, as it should. I go through the usual riffs. Yes, I
concede, these problems cry out for a comprehensive legislative solution
rather than case-by-case adjudication. But standard, well-known
counter-arguments suggest that Judge Lambros should nevertheless have
imposed tort liability in this case. For one thing, determining the
rules of tort liability has always been within the province of courts.
Deferring to the status quo (that those who move capital are not legally
responsible for negative externalities) is every bit as much a choice,
every bit as much "activism" or "social engineering," as altering the
status quo. Legal history is filled with cases in which the legislature
was only prompted to address an important public policy concern by the
shock value of a court decision. Particularly is this so in cases
involving the rights and interests of marginalized, insular, and
under-represented groups like aging industrial workers. I note that
Congress eventually responded to the plant closing problem with the WARN
Act, a modest but not unimportant effort to internalize to enterprises
some of the social dislocation costs of capital disinvestment. The
statute liquidates these costs into a sum equal to sixty days‟ pay after
an employer orders a plant closing or mass layoff without giving proper
notice.36 I call the students‟ attention to the provision of WARN
barring federal courts from enjoining plant closings37 and ask why
Congress might have included that restriction. Another common objection
concerns causation. A student will say: "The closedown of the mills, let
alone the shutdown of any particular plant, could not have caused all of
the suicides, heart failures, domestic violence, and so on, in
Youngstown. Surely many such tragedies would have occurred anyway, even
if U.S. Steel had remained. It isn‟t fair to impose liability on U.S.
Steel for everything bad that happened in Youngstown during the
statute-of-limitations period." I immediately say that this is a
terrific point, and that I was hoping someone would raise it. I
compliment the student by saying that the question shows that he/she is
now tapping legal knowledge. Typically, the class is concerned with
causation-in-fact or "but for" causation. Their question is, how do we
know that a plant shutdown caused any particular case of heart failure
or suicide in Youngstown? Problems of causal uncertainty are a familiar
issue, and I remind students that they were exposed to several
well-known responses in Torts. A time-honored, if simplistic device is
to shift the burden of proof regarding causationinfact to the defendant,
when everyone knows full well that the defendant has no more information
than the plaintiff with which to resolve the problem of causal
uncertainty.38 In recent decades, courts have developed more
sophisticated responses to problems of causal uncertainty as, for
example, in the DES cases. As the court stated in Sindell:39 In our
contemporary complex industrialized society, advances in science and
technology create fungible goods which may harm consumers and which
cannot be traced to any specific producer. The response of the courts
can be either to adhere rigidly to prior doctrine, denying recovery to
those injured by such products, or to fashion remedies to meet these
changing needs. Just as Justice Traynor in his landmark concurring
opinion in Escola . . . recognized that in an era of mass production and
complex marketing methods the traditional standard of negligence was
insufficient to govern the obligations of manufacturer to consumer, so
should we acknowledge that some adaptation of the rules of causation and
liability may be appropriate in these recurring circumstances . . . .40
At this point, some of the progressive students are beginning to
salivate. They came to law school with the hope that legal reasoning
would provide them a highly refined and politically neutral technology
for speaking truth to power. The first semester disabuses most of them
of that crazy idea. They have learned that they will not find certainty
or answers in legal discourse, and that legal texts are minefields of
gaps, conflicts, and ambiguities with moral and political implications.
I can tell from the glint in their eyes that they are beginning to ask
themselves whether this economics stuff, which they formerly shunned
like the plague, might provide a substitute toolbox of neutral
technologies with which to demonstrate that redress for workers and
other subordinated and marginalized groups is legally required. I cannot
allow them to think that. Therefore, unless an alert student has spotted
it, I now reveal my Achilles‟ heel. The weak link in my argument is the
age-old question of proximate causation. Assume we solve the
causation-in-fact problem. For example, assume that by analogy to the
Sindell theory of market-share liability, the court arrives at a fair
method of attributing to the plant shutdown some portion of the social
trauma and injuries occurring in the wake of U.S. Steel‟s departure from
Youngstown. How do we know whether the plant closing proximately caused
these harms? What do we mean by "proximate causation" anyway, and why
does it matter? These questions present another exciting, teachable
moment. Naturally, the students haven‟t thought about proximate cause
since first year. They barely remember what it is and how it differs
from causation-in-fact. Some 3Ls shuffle uncomfortably knowing that the
Bar examination looms, and they are soon going to need to know about
this. I provide a quick review of proximate causation which addresses
the question, how far down the chain of causation should liability
reach? I illustrate my points by referring to Palsgraf v. Long Island
R.R,41 which all law students remember. Perhaps U.S. Steel might fairly
be held accountable for the suicide of steelworkers within ninety days
of the plant closing, but we might draw the line before holding U.S.
Steel liable for a stroke suffered by a steelworker‟s spouse five years
later. Now keyed in to what proximate cause doctrine is about, the
students eagerly wait for me to tell them what the "answer" is, that is,
where proximate causation doctrine would draw the line in the Youngstown
case. That‟s when I give them the bad news. I explain that proximate
causation doctrine does not provide a determinate analytical method for
measuring the scope of liability. We pretend that buzzwords like
"reasonable foreseeability" or "scope-of-the-risk" give us answers, but
ultimately decisions made under the rubric of proximate causation are
always value judgments.42 The conclusion that "X proximately caused Y"
is a statement about the type of society we want to live in. At this
juncture, the 3Ls grumpily realize that I am not going to be much help
in preparing them for their bar review course. I now distribute a
one-page hand-out on proximate causation prepared in advance. The
handout reprints Justice Andrews‟ remarkable observation in his Palsgraf
dissent: What we . . . mean by the word „proximate‟ is, that because of
convenience, of public policy, of a rough sense of justice, the law
arbitrarily declines to trace a series of events beyond a certain point.
This is not logic. It is practical politics . . . . It is all a question
of expediency. There are no fixed rules to govern our judgment. There
are simply matters of which we may take account.43 I point out that
causation-in-fact analysis, too, always involves perspective and value
judgments.44 Why assume that water escaping the reservoir diminished the
value of the neighboring coal mining company‟s land? Why not assume that
the coal company‟s decision to dig close to the border diminished the
value of the manufacturer‟s land (by increasing the cost of using the
type of reservoir needed in its production process)? For that matter,
why assume that the cattle trample on the neighbors‟ crops? Why not
assume that the crops get in the way of the cattle? My handout also
contains my variation on Robert Keeton‟s famous definition of proximate
cause45: When a court states that „the defendant‟s conduct was the
proximate cause of (some portion of) the plaintiff‟s injuries,‟ what the
court means is that (1) the defendant‟s conduct was a cause-in-fact of
that portion of plaintiff‟s injuries; and (2) the defendant‟s conduct
and the plaintiff‟s specified injuries are so related that it is
appropriate, from the moral and social-policy points of view, to hold
the defendant legally responsible for that portion of the plaintiff‟s
injuries. What we mean when we ask whether the social dislocation costs
associated with the shutdown of the steel plant were proximately caused
by capital mobility is whether these costs are, in whole or in part,
properly attributable from a moral/political point of view to U.S.
Steel‟s decision to disinvest. Economic "science" does not and cannot
establish in a value-neutral manner that the social dislocation costs of
the plant shutdown are a negative externality of capital mobility. A
conclusion of that kind requires a value judgment that we disguise under
the rubric of "proximate causation," a value judgment about whom it is
appropriate to ask to bear what costs related to what injuries. The
lesson is that [in legal reasoning]{.underline} **[there is no
escape]{.underline}** **[from moral and political choice]{.underline}**.
If things have gone according to plan, time conveniently runs out, and
the class is dismissed on that note. What am I trying to accomplish in a
class like this? What are the objectives of critical legal pedagogy?
[[Legal education should]{.underline} **[empower
students]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [It should put them in touch with their
**own capacity**]{.underline} [to take control over their

**[[in transformative social movements]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But all
too often classroom legal education is deadening. The law student‟s job,
mastering doctrine, appears utterly unconnected to any process of
learning about oneself or developing one‟s moral, political, or
professional identity. [Classroom legal education tends to reinforce **a
sense of powerlessness** about our capacity to change social
institutions]{.underline}. Indeed, [it often induces students to
feel]{.underline} that [they are powerless to shape and alter their own

**Pappas 17**---Associate Professor of Philosophy at Texas A& M
University \[Gregory Fernando, 2017, "The Limitations and Dangers of
Decolonial Philosophies: Lessons from Zapatista Luis Villoro", Radical
Philosophy Review, DOI: 10.5840/radphilrev201732768\] AMarb

For Villoro a **[[serious study]{.mark} of ideologies [has to be as
specific to time and place as possible.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The
**[[quest for theoretical barometers of good and evil]{.mark} at a
global level and across history should be subject to critical suspicion
and [may be futile since]{.mark} the [present ideological function of
a]{.mark} concept/[category is not always determined by]{.mark} its
[past use or]{.mark} the [original purpose]{.mark}]{.underline}** for
which it was created. A **[[distinction created to oppress may
play]{.mark} a different function or have [different functions in
different social contexts.]{.mark} Modernity and [liberalism]{.mark}
have [not always functioned]{.mark} as ideologies or [to the same
degree, nor]{.mark} does it make sense to claim that they [always will.
Even native thought]{.mark}]{.underline}** (indigenismo) **[[can become
an ideology]{.mark} if adopted to keep the oppressed in their
place]{.underline}**, i.e., **[[if it perpetuates]{.mark} subordination
or [oppression.]{.mark}]{.underline}**39 If Villoro is correct in the
above analysis then **[decolonial [views are vulnerable to inaccuracy
and insensitivity]{.mark}]{.underline}**, especially those that wish to
trace back to 1492 and across different countries the ideologies that
have supported coloniality---such as modernity, capitalism, or
liberalism. Villoro did not ignore how historically similar colonial
structures were throughout the Americas, but for him ideologies and the
**[logic of domination that operate in one particular place and time may
not operate in the exact same way in another]{.underline}**, especially
in such a complex and diverse region as the whole of Latin America.
**[[If domination and exclusion]{.mark} via ideologies [are
local]{.mark}, its [diagnosis and remedies must]{.mark} also have to [be
local.]{.mark}]{.underline}** We need to be careful when we extrapolate
from one context to another. Villoro raised a similar criticism of
leftist **[reactions to the problem of Eurocentrism that relies on
simple formulas that state we just need to embrace what is "ours" and
reject what is European.]{.underline}** Although Villoro was a critic of
Eurocentrism and admirer of indigenous thought, he warned Zea and the
Latin Americanist or indigenismos movement to not react to Eurocentrism
and the colonial Manichaean ideas, where what is "ours" or indigenous is
denigrated, with a mere inversion of the Manicheanism. For Villoro the
**[Left must [resist the temptation to rely on lazy theoretical
barometers]{.mark} of good and evil. [It must]{.mark} be able to
[provide a basis for being critical of]{.mark} Western [ideas
beyond]{.mark} the fact that [they are Western or come from the
oppressor. Not all Western concepts]{.mark}, standards, and categories
[are oppressive]{.mark} even to the most non-Western people. [To decide
between good and evil requires intelligent discriminative
judgment]{.mark} and not easy theoretical formulas according to
geopolitical coordinates]{.underline}** or cultural origins. Again,
**[even native thought]{.underline}** (indigenismo) **[can become an
ideology.]{.underline}** He expected the Left to be sensitive to this,
but what he actually experienced was a Left slipping dangerously toward
subtle Manichaean assumptions, i.e., simplistic barometers about the
boundaries between good and evil. **[This]{.underline}**, I am afraid,
**[is a danger in decolonial thought, one that seems unavoidable as long
as they make central to their project the coloniality axis that relies
on binaries to determine the direction of good and evil.]{.underline}**
I am aware that it is not easy to oppose a binary without just inverting
it, but we must be careful. To be fair, decolonial thought has been
critical of Manichaeism as part of the colonial legacy and **[there is
no doubt about their good intentions to move in a pluralistic direction
where there is no one central epistemology. However, [this
center-versus-periphery framework is]{.mark} easily [susceptible to
slipping into]{.mark} the [simplistic view that all evil comes
from]{.mark} what is at the center---Europe, the West, modernity,
[liberalism]{.mark}, capitalism.]{.underline}** For instance, **[Mignolo
describes the decolonial project as ["delinking" from the West]{.mark}
and recovery of the indigenous as if this determines what is the right
path from evil toward the good.]{.underline}**40 **[This [smells like a
subtle Manichaeism]{.mark}]{.underline}** or at least a position that
does not permit inquiry that is sensitive to historical context. The
decolonialists' criticism of the hegemony of the West is warranted and
important, but for it to continue as a growing project that does not
succumb to the excesses (vices) of the Left that Villoro diagnosed **[it
must be careful to not slip into any of the following
assumptions]{.underline}**: • **[Modernity and liberalism were and are
totally bad; they are ideologies for dominating, colonizing, and
oppressing]{.underline}** or only have a darker side. • Eurocentrism
(interpretation, standpoint) is bad, but philosophy from the periphery
is good. • **[Western concepts have been used to distort or occlude
indigenous (non-Western) ones]{.underline}** therefore all or most

### at: libidinal economy

#### Unconscious bias exists, but it is NOT a libidinal economy\-\--psychoanalytic explanations ignore specific social and cultural value systems and confuses habit with instinct

Peter **Hudis 15**, Professor of English and History @ Queens College,
2015, "Frantz Fanon: Philosopher of the Barricades," Pg. 35-37

Fanon's vantage point upon the world is his situated experience. He is
trying to understand the inner psychic life of racism, not provide an
account of the structure of human existence as a whole. **[[Racism is
not]{.underline}]{.mark}**, of course, **[[an integral part of the human
psyche; it is a Social construct that has a psychic impact. Any effort
to comprehend]{.mark} social distress that accompanies [racism by
reference to some a priori structure- be it]{.mark} the [Oedipal]{.mark}
Complex [or the Collective Unconscious]{.mark}- [is doomed to
failure.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Carl Jung sought to deepen and go beyond Freud\'s approach by arguing
that the subconscious is grounded in a universal layer of the psyche-
which he called **[[\"the collective unconscious:]{.mark}\' This [refers
to inherited patterns]{.mark} of thought [that exist in all]{.mark}
human minds, [regardless of specific]{.mark} culture or
[upbringing]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and which manifest themselves in
dreams, fairy tales, and myths. Jung referred to these universal
patterns as \"archetypes:\' It may seem, on a superficial reading, that
1 Fanon is drawing from Jung, since he discusses how white people tend
to unconsciously assimilate views of blacks that are based on negative
stereotypes. Even the most \"progressive\" white tends to think of
blacks a certain way (such as \"emotional;\' \"physical,\" or /
\"aggressive\"), even as they disavow any racist animus on their part.
However, **[[Fanon denies that]{.mark} such collective
[delusions]{.mark} are part of a psychic structure]{.underline}**; they
**[[are]{.underline}]{.mark}** not **[[permanent features of the mind.
They are habits acquired from]{.mark} a series of [social and cultural
impositions]{.mark}. While [they constitute a]{.mark} kind a [collective
unconscious on the part of many]{.mark} white people, [they are
not]{.mark} grounded in any [universal]{.mark}
\"archetype.\"]{.underline}** The unconscious prejudices of whites do
not derive from genes or nature, nor do they derive from some form
independent of culture or upbringing. Fanon contends
**[[that]{.underline}]{.mark}** Jung **[[\"confuses habit with
instinct.\"]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Fanon objects to Jung\'s \"collective unconscious\" for the same reason
that he rejects the notion of a black ontology. His phenomenological
approach brackets out ontological claims on both a social and
psychological level insofar as the examination of race and racism is
concerned. He writes, \"Neither Freud nor Adler nor even the cosmic Jung
took the black man into consideration in the course of his research."

This does not mean that Fanon rejects their contributions tout court. He
does not deny the existence of the unconscious. He only denies that the
inferiority complex of blacks operates on an unconscious level. **[He
does not reject the Oedipal Complex. He only denies that it explains
(especially in the West Indies) the proclivity of the black \"slave\" to
mimic the values of the white \"master.\"]{.underline}** And as seen
from his positive remarks on Lacan\'s theory of the mirror stage, he
does not reject the idea of psychic structure. He only denies that it
can substitute for an historical understanding of the origin of neuroses
.23 Fanon adopts a socio-genetic approach to a study of the psyche
because that is what is adequate for the object of his analysis.

For Fanon, **[it is the relationship between the socio-economic and
psychological that is of critical import. He makes it clear, insofar as
the subject matter of his study is concerned, that [the socio-economic
is]{.mark} first of all [responsible for affective
disorders]{.mark}]{.underline}**: \"First, economic. Then,
internalization or rather epidermalization of this inferiority.\"24
Fanon never misses an opportunity to remind us that racism owes its
origin to specific economic relations of domination- such as slavery,
colonialism, and the effort to coopt sections of the working class into
serving the needs of capital. It is hard to mistake the Marxist
influence here. It does not follow, however, that what comes first in
the order of time has conceptual or strategic priority. The inferiority
complex is originally born from economic subjugation, but it takes on a
life of its own and expresses itself in terms that surpass the economic.
Both sides of the problem-the socio-economic and psychological-must be
combatted in tandem: \"The black man must wage the struggle on two
levels; whereas historically these levels are mutually dependent, **[any
unilateral liberation is flawed]{.underline}**, and the worst mistake
would be to believe their mutual dependence automatic:\'\'5

On these grounds he argues that the problem of **[[racism cannot be
solved on a psychological level. It is not]{.underline}]{.mark}** an
**[[\"individual\"]{.underline}]{.mark}** problem; **[[it
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** a **[[social]{.underline}]{.mark}** one. But
neither can it be solved on a social level that ores the psychological.
It is small wonder that although his name never appears in the book,
Fanon was enamored of the work of Wilhelm Reich. This important
Freudian-Marxist would no doubt feel affinity with Fanon\'s comment,
\"Genuine **[[disalienation will]{.underline}]{.mark}** have
**[[be]{.underline}]{.mark}**en **[[achieved only when things, in
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** most **[[materialist
sense]{.underline}]{.mark}**, have **[[resumed their rightful
place]{.underline}]{.mark}**:\'27

#### **That drives exist doesn't imply that they are totalizing\-\--psychological processes are internally diffuse and contradictory**

Adrian **Johnston 5**, Philosophy Professor @ University of New Mexico,
Time Driven: Metapsychology and the Splitting of the Drive, Northwestern
University Press, Jul 27, 2005, pg. 340-341

In terms of the basic framework of metapsychology, [Freud delineates two
fundamental types of conflict]{.underline} disturbing yet organizing
mental life---the [conflict between drives and reality]{.underline} (as,
most notably, the struggle In-tween the id and civilization) [and the
conflict between the drives themselves]{.underline} in la the story of
Eros against the Todrstrieb). In both cases[, [the individual lends lo
be portrayed as]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
**[overdetermined]{.mark}**]{.underline} [play-thing of powerful forces
fighting semi-covert wars with each other just out of the ego\'s
sight]{.underline}. However, [[Freud fails to discover]{.mark} a third
dimension]{.underline} of conflict in relation to the libidinal
economy---[[the conflict **within each**]{.mark} **and every
[drive]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The theoretical contribution of this
project could easily be summarized as the identification of this
distinct type of conflict and the explication of its sobering
consequences for an understanding of the psyche. [[Despite]{.mark} the
apparent **[bleakness]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and antiutopianism [of an
assessment of]{.mark} human [nature as]{.mark} being [perturbed by
a]{.mark}n **irreducible [inner antagonism]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[there i]{.mark}s. surprisingly, what might be described as [a]{.mark}
[**liberating aspect** to this]{.mark} **splitting of the drives**.
Since [drives are e]{.mark}ssentially
**[dysfunctional]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[subjects are able to act
otherwise]{.mark} than as would be dictated by in-stinctually compelled
pursuits]{.underline} of gratification, satisfaction, and pleasure. [In
fact, subjects are forced to be free,]{.underline} [since, for such
beings]{.underline}, [the mandate of nature is forever
missing]{.underline}. [Severed from a strictly biological master-program
and saddled with a conflict-ridden]{.underline}, [heterogeneous jumble
of **contradictory impulses**]{.underline}---[impulses mediated by an
**inconsistent**, **unstable** web of **multiple
representations**]{.underline}, indicated by Lacan\'s \"barring\" of the
Symbolic Other---[the parletre has no choice but to **bump up against
the unnatural void of its autonomy**]{.underline}. [The confrontation
with this raid is **frequently avoided**. The true extent of one\'s
**autonomy** is]{.underline}, due to its sometimes-frightening
implications, [just as often **relegated to the shadows of the
unconscious** as those heteronomous factors secretly shaping conscious
thought and behavior. [The **contradictions** arising from]{.mark} the
[conflicts internal to the libidi-nal economy]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[mark the **precise**]{.mark} [**places** where]{.mark} a
**[freedom]{.mark} transcending mundane materiality** [has a chance
to]{.mark} briefly **[flash into]{.mark} effective
[existence]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [[such]{.mark} points of
[breakdown]{.mark} in the deterministic nexus [of]{.mark} the [drives
**clear the space** for the **sudden emergence**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[of something other than]{.mark} the smooth [continuation of the
default]{.mark} physical and sociopsychical]{.underline} [\"[run of
things]{.mark}.\"]{.underline} Moreover, if the drives were fully
functional---and. hence, would not prompt a mobilization of a series of
defensive distancing mechanisms struggling to transcend this threatening
corpo-Real---humans would be animalistic automatons, namely, creatures
of nature. [[The pain of a]{.mark} malfunctioning]{.underline},
internally [[conflicted]{.mark} libidinal [economy is]{.mark} a
discomfort [signaling a capacity to be]{.mark} an [autonomous]{.mark}
subject.]{.underline} [This is a pain even more essential to human
autonomy than what Kant identifies]{.underline} .is the guilt-inducing
burden of duty and its corresponding pangs of anxious, awe-inspiring
respect. Whereas Kant treats the discomfort associated with duty as a
symptom-effect of a transcendental freedom inherent to rational beings,
the reverse might (also) be the case: [Such freedom is the
symptom-effect of a discomfort inherent to libidinal
beings.]{.underline} [Completely \"curing\" individuals of this
discomfort]{.underline}, **[even if it were possible]{.underline}**,
[would be tantamount to divesting them, whether they realize it or not,
of an essential feature of their dignity as subjects]{.underline}. As
Lacan might phrase it, the split Trieb is the sinthome of subjectivity
proper, [the source of a suffering that, were it to be entirely
eliminated, would entail the **utter dissolution of subjectivity
itself**]{.underline}. [[Humanity is]{.mark} [free]{.mark} precisely
insofar as its pleasures are far from perfection, [insofar as]{.mark}
its [enjoyment is never absolute]{.mark}]{.underline}.

If the second order of politics in the age of the spectacle is to
harvest our attention and seduce us into desiring our own oppression,
our task is to \[End Page 220\] recognize our own shameful compromises
with the spectacle. This requires modes of critical reflection which not
only forces us to be alert to the ways in which our attentions might be
harvested by the seduction of violent images, but how we might be
co-opted by forms of depraved aesthetics that debase the political
subject. We need to learn to live with violence less through the
modality of the sacred than through the critical lens of the profane. By
this we mean that **[we need to appreciate]{.underline}** our **[violent
histories]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[how our
subjectivities]{.underline}** **[have been formed through a history of
physical bloodshed]{.underline}**. **[[This requires more]{.mark} of a
[willingness]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[to interrogate violence
in]{.mark} a]{.underline}** **[variety of registers]{.underline}**
(**[ranging]{.underline}** **[from the
[historical]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[and]{.underline}** **[concrete
\[registers\]]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[to]{.underline}** the
**[abstract]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[symbolic]{.underline}**) **[[than]{.mark} it does a [bending
to]{.mark} the [neoliberal discourses]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[of]{.underline}]{.mark}** [**[fate]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[normalization]{.underline}**]{.mark}. We need
to acknowledge our own seductions with the varied forces of violence.
And we need to accept that intellectualism and the ideas it generates,
the imaginaries it creates, and the visions of the world it endorses
shares an intimate relationship with violence both in its complicity
with violence and as an act of violence. Having said this, we cannot
divorce here the idea of the desiring subject of violence from wider
systemic relations and historical configurations. **[[Too
often]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[the mediation of
[suffering]{.mark}]{.underline}** through the formal qualities of
tolerability and design **[[are presented as matter of]{.mark} personal
[pleasure]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[and]{.underline}**
**[taste]{.underline}** **[rather than]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[part of
[a broader]{.mark}]{.underline}** engaged **[[social-political
discourse]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[This]{.underline}]{.mark}** all
**[too easily]{.underline}** **[[leads to questions of individual
pathology]{.mark} altogether]{.underline}** **[[removed from any sense
of]{.mark} the [conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[that give rise to
libidinal investments]{.underline}]{.mark}**. If we are to have a better
picture of the debasement of the human subject, **[we need to address
the relationships between individual desires]{.underline}**,
representations of human suffering, humiliation **[and
death]{.underline}** **[as part of a wider economy]{.underline}** of
pleasure that is collectively indulged. As decadence and despair are
normalised in the wider culture---though this is very different from
accomplished in the goal to remove all dissent---people are increasingly
exploited for their pleasure quotient while any viable notion of the
social is subordinated to the violence of a deregulated market economy
and its production of cultures of cruelty.

#### Afropessimism mistakes "an" anti-black world, characterized by anti-black instructions that deny Black freedom, for the antiblack world\-\--both pessimism and optimism fail to take political responsibility for political actions, a conception of blacks as human reframes "so-called" failures as actions that alter the possibilities of change 

Lewis R. **Gordon 17**, Ph.D., Professor of Philosophy and Africana
Studies, with affiliations in Judaic Studies and Caribbean, Latino/a,
and Latin American Studies, University of Connecticut at Storrs,
Visiting Europhilosophy Professor at Toulouse University, 12-7-17,
"Thoughts on Afropessimism," Critical Political Theory (2017), p. 1-8

''Afropessimism'' came out of ''Afro-pessimism.'' The elimination of the
hyphen is an important development, since it dispels ambiguity and in
effect announces a specific mode of thought. Should the hyphen remain,
the ambiguity would be between pessimistic people of African descent and
theoretical pessimism. The conjoined, theoretical term is what
proponents often have in mind in their diagnosis of what I shall call
''the black condition.'' **[The [appeal to a black condition is]{.mark}
peculiarly [existential]{.mark}. Existentialists reject notions of human
''nature'' on the grounds that human beings live in worlds they also
construct; they produce their socalled essence. [That does not
mean]{.mark}, however, [human beings lack
anchorage]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Everyone has to start from
somewhere.]{.underline}** **[Existentialists call that somewhere a
condition or conditions for these reasons, and the world human beings
produce or through which we live is sometimes called ''human
reality.]{.underline}**'' **[[Critics of existentialism]{.mark} often
[reject its human formulation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Heidegger, for
instance, in his ''Letter on Humanism,'' lambasted Sartre for supposedly
in effect subordinating Being to a philosophical anthropology with
dangers of anthropocentrism (Heidegger, 1971). **[Yet a philosophical
understanding of culture raises the problem of the conditions through
which philosophical reflections could emerge as meaningful. Although a
human activity, a more radical understanding of culture raises the
question of the human being as the producer of an open reality. If the
human being is in the making, then ''human reality'' is never
complet[e]{.mark} and is more the relations in which such thought takes
place than a claim about the thought]{.underline}**. The etymology of
existence already points to these elements. From the Latin ex sistere,
''to stand out,'' it also means to appear; against invisibility in the
stream of effects through which the human world appears, much appears
through the creative and at times alchemic force of human thought and
deed. Quarrels with and against existential thought are many. In more
recent times, they've emerged primarily from Marxists, structuralists,
and poststructuralists, even though there were, and continue to be, many
existential Marxists and even existentialists with structuralist and
poststructuralist leanings. **[I begin with this tale of philosophical
abstraction to contextualize Afropessimism.]{.underline}** **[Its main
exemplars,]{.underline}** **[such as Jared Sexton and Frank Wilderson
III, emerged from academic literary theory, an area dominated by
poststructuralism even in many cases that avow
''Marxism.]{.underline}**'' Sexton (2010) and Wilderson (2007) divert
from a reductive poststructuralism, however, through examining important
existential moves inaugurated, as Daniel McNeil (2011, 2012) observed,
by Fanon and his intellectual heirs. **[The critical question that
Afropessimism addresses in this fusion is the viability of posed
strategies of Black liberation]{.underline}**. (I'm using the capital
''B'' here to point not only to the racial designation ''black'' but
also to the nationalist one ''Black.'' Afropessimists often mean both,
since blacks and Blacks have a central and centered role in their
thought.) **[The world that produced blacks and in consequence Blacks
is, for Afropessimists, a crushing, historical one whose Manichaean
divide is sustained contraries best kept segregated.]{.underline}**
**[Worse, any effort of mediation leads to confirmed black
subordination]{.underline}**. **[Overcoming this requires purging the
world of antiblackness. Where cleansing the world is unachievable, an
alternative is to disarm the force of antiblack racism. Where whites
lack power over blacks, they lose relevance]{.underline}** -- **[at
least politically and at levels of cultural and racial capital or
hegemony]{.underline}**. **[Wilderson]{.underline}** (2008), for
instance, **[explores my concept of ''an antiblack world'' to build
similar arguments. Sexton]{.underline}** (2011) **[makes similar moves
in his discussions of ''social death.]{.underline}**'' As this forum
doesn't afford space for a long critique, I'll offer several,
non-exhaustive criticisms. **[The first is that]{.underline}**
**[''[an]{.mark} [antiblack world'']{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[is not
identical with ''the world is antiblack]{.underline}**.]{.mark}'' **[My
argument is that [such a world is an]{.mark} [antiblack]{.mark} racist
[project]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[It is [not the historical
achievement]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Its [limitations emerge
from]{.mark} [a basic fact]{.mark}]{.underline}**[: **[Black
people]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[and other opponents of such a project
[fought, and continue to fight]{.mark}, as we see today in the
#BlackLivesMatter movement and many others, against it]{.underline}**.
**[[The same argument applies to]{.mark} the argument about [social
death]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Such an achievement would have rendered
even these reflections stillborn. The basic premises of the
[Afropessimistic argument are]{.mark}, then, [locked in performative
contradictions]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Yet, they have rhetorical force.
This is evident through the continued growth of its proponents and
forums (such as this one) devoted to it. In Bad Faith and Antiblack
Racism, I argued that there are forms of antiblack racism offered under
the guise of love, though I was writing about whites who exoticize
blacks while offering themselves as white sources of black value.
Analyzed in terms of bad faith, where one lies to oneself in an attempt
to flee displeasing truths for pleasing falsehoods, exoticists
romanticize blacks while affirming white normativity, and thus
themselves, as principals of reality. These ironic, **[performative
contradictions are features of all forms of racism, where one group is
elevated to godlike status and another is pushed below that of human
despite both claiming to be human]{.underline}**. **[Antiblack racism
offers whites self-other relations]{.underline}** (necessary for ethics)
**[with each other but not so for groups forced in a ''zone of
nonbeing'' below them]{.underline}**. There is asymmetry where whites
stand as others who look downward to those who are not their others or
their analogues. **[[Antiblack racism is]{.mark} thus [not a problem of
blacks being ''others]{.mark}.'' It's a problem of their
not-being-analogical-selves-and-not-evenbeing- others]{.underline}**.
Fanon, in Black Skin, White Masks (1952), reminds us that **[Blacks
among each other live in a world of selves and others. It is in
attempted relations with whites that these problems
occur.]{.underline}** Reason in such contexts has a bad habit of walking
out when Blacks enter. What are Blacks to do? As reason cannot be
forced, because that would be ''violence,'' they must ironically reason
reasonably with forms of unreasonable reason. Contradictions loom**[.
Racism is]{.underline}**, given these arguments, **[a project of
imposing non-relations as the model of dealing with people designated
''black.]{.underline}**'' In Les Damne´ de la terre (''Damned of the
Earth''), Fanon goes further and argues that colonialism is an attempt
to impose a Manichean structure of contraries instead of a dialectical
one of ongoing, human negotiation of contradictions. The former
segregates the groups; the latter emerges from interaction. The police,
he observes, are the mediator in such a situation, as their role is
force/violence instead of the human, discursive one of politics and
civility (Fanon, 1991). Such societies draw legitimacy from Black
non-existence or invisibility. Black appearance, in other words, would
be a violation of those systems. Think of the continued blight of
police, extra-judicial killings of Blacks in those countries. **[An
immediate observation of many postcolonies is that antiblack attitudes,
practices, and institutions aren't exclusively white. Black antiblack
dispositions make this clear. Black antiblackness entails Black
exoticism]{.underline}**. Where this exists, **[Blacks simultaneously
receive Black love alongside Black rejection of agency. Many problems
follow. The absence of agency bars maturation, which would reinforce the
racial logic of Blacks as in effect wards of whites. Without agency,
ethics, liberation, maturation, politics, and responsibility could not
be possible]{.underline}**. Afropessimism faces the problem of a hidden
premise of white agency versus Black incapacity. Proponents of
Afropessimism would no doubt respond that the theory itself is a form of
agency reminiscent of Fanon's famous remark that though whites created
le Ne\`gre it was les Ne\`gres who created Ne´gritude.
**[[Whites]{.mark} clearly [did not create Afropessimism]{.mark}, which
Black liberationists should celebrate. [We should avoid]{.mark} the
fallacy]{.underline}**, however, **[of [confusing source with
outcome]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[History is not short of bad ideas
from good people]{.underline}**. **[[If intrinsically
good]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, **[[each person of African descent
would become ethically]{.mark} and epistemologically [a switching of the
Manichean contraries,]{.mark} which means [only changing players instead
of the game]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[We come]{.underline}**, then,
**[to the crux of the matter. [If the goal of Afropessimism is
Afropessimism, its achievement would be attitudinal]{.mark} and, in the
language of old, stoic]{.underline}** -- **[in short, a symptom of
antiblack society.]{.underline}** At this point, **[there are several
observations that follow. The first is a diagnosis of the implications
of Afropessimism as symptom. The second examines the epistemological
implications of Afropessimism. The third is whether a disposition counts
as a political act and, if so, is it sufficient for its avowed
aims]{.underline}**. There are more, but for the sake of brevity, I'll
simply focus on these. **[An ironic dimension of [pessimism]{.mark} is
that it [is the other side of optimism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Oddly
enough, [both are connected to nihilism,]{.mark} which
is]{.underline}**, as Nietzsche (1968) showed, **[a decline of values
during periods of social decay. It emerges when people no longer want to
be responsible for their actions. [Optimists expect intervention]{.mark}
from beyond. [Pessimists declare relief is not
forthcoming]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[[Neither takes
responsibility]{.mark} for what is valued]{.underline}**. **[The
valuing, however, is what leads to the second, epistemic
point.]{.underline}** **[The presumption that what is at stake is what
can be known to determine what can be done is the problem. If such
knowledge were possible, the debate would be about who is reading the
evidence correctly.]{.underline}** **[Such judgment would be a priori --
that is, prior to events actually unfolding. The future, unlike
transcendental conditions such as language, signs, and reality, is,
however, ex post facto: It is yet to come.]{.underline}** **[Facing the
future, the question isn't what will be or how do we know what will be
but instead the realization that whatever is done will be that on which
the future will depend. Rejecting optimism and pessimism, [there
is]{.mark} a supervening [alternative]{.mark}]{.underline}**[:
**[political commitment]{.underline}**]{.mark}. The appeal to political
commitment is not only in stream with what French existentialists call
l'intellectuel engage´ (committed intellectual) but also reaches back
through the history and existential situation of enslaved, racialized
ancestors. Many were, in truth, an existential paradox: commitment to
action without guarantees. The slave revolts, micro and macro acts of
resistance, escapes, and returns help others do the same; the cultivated
instability of plantations and other forms of enslavement, and countless
other actions, were waged against a gauntlet of forces designed to
eliminate any hope of success. The claim of colonialists and enslavers
was that the future belonged to them, not to the enslaved and the
indigenous. A result of more than 500 years of conquest and 300 years of
enslavement was also a (white) rewriting of history in which African and
First Nations' agency was, at least at the level of scholarship, nearly
erased. Yet there was resistance even in that realm, as Africana and
First Nation intellectual history and scholarship attest. Such actions
set the course for different kinds of struggle today. Such reflections
occasion meditations on the concept of failure.
**[[Afropessimism]{.mark}, the existential critique suggests, [suffers
from]{.mark} a [failure to understand failure]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Consider Fanon's notion of constructive failure, **[where what doesn't
initially work transforms conditions for something new to
emerge]{.underline}**. To understand this argument, one must rethink the
philosophical anthropology at the heart of a specific line of Euromodern
thought on what it means to be human**[. Atomistic and individual
substance]{.underline}**- **[based, this model, articulated by Hobbes,
Locke, and many others, is of a non-relational being that thinks, acts,
and moves along a course in which continued movement depends on not
colliding with others]{.underline}**. Under that model, **[the human
being is a thing that enters a system that facilitates or obstructs its
movement.]{.underline}** **[An alternative model, shared by many groups
across southern Africa, is a relational version of the human being as
part of a larger system of meaning.]{.underline}** **[Actions, from that
perspective, are not about whether ''I'' succeed but instead about
''our'' story across time]{.underline}**. As relational, **[it means
that [each human]{.mark} being [is a constant negotiation of]{.mark}
ongoing [efforts to build relationships]{.mark} with
others]{.underline}**, **[which means no one actually enters a situation
without establishing new situations of action and meaning. Instead of
entering a game, their participation requires a different kind of
project]{.underline}** -- **[especially where the ''game'' was premised
on their exclusion]{.underline}**. **[Thus, where the system or game
repels initial participation, such repulsion is a shift in the grammar
of how the system functions, especially its dependence on obsequious
subjects]{.underline}**. **[[Shifted energy affords emergence of
alternatives]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Kinds cannot be known before the
actions that birthed them]{.underline}**. **[Abstract as this sounds, it
has much historical support]{.underline}**. Evelyn Simien (2016), in her
insightful political study Historic Firsts, examines the new set of
relations established by Shirley Chisholm's and Jesse Jackson's
presidential campaigns. **[There could be no Barack Obama]{.underline}**
**[without such important predecessors affecting the demographics of
voter participation]{.underline}**. Simien intentionally focused on the
most mainstream example of political life to illustrate this point.
**[Although no exemplar of radicalism, Obama's ''success'' emerged from
Chisholm and Jackson's (and many others') so-called
''failure.'']{.underline}** **[Beyond presidential electoral politics,
[there are numerous examples of]{.mark} [how]{.mark} prior, radical
[so-called ''failures'' transformed relationships that facilitated
other]{.mark} kinds of [outcome]{.mark}. The trail goes back to the
Haitian Revolution and back to every act of resistance from Nat Turner's
Rebellion in the USA, Sharpe's in Jamaica, or Tula's in Curac¸ao and so
many other efforts for social transformation to come.]{.underline}**
**[In existential terms, then, many ancestors of the African diaspora
embodied]{.underline}** what Søren Kierkegaard (1983) calls an
**[existential paradox]{.underline}**. **[All the evidence around them
suggested failure and the futility of hope]{.underline}**. **[They first
had to make a movement of infinite resignation]{.underline}** -- **[that
is, resigning themselves to their situation]{.underline}**. **[Yet they
must simultaneously act against that situation. Kierkegaard called this
seemingly contradictory phenomenon ''faith,'' but that concept relates
more to a relationship with a transcendent, absolute being, which could
only be established by a ''leap,]{.underline}**'' as there are no
mediations or bridge. **[Ironically, if Afropessimism appeals to
transcendent intervention, it would collapse into faith.
If]{.underline}**, **[however, the argument rejects transcendent
intervention and focuses on committed political action]{.underline}**,
**[of taking responsibility for a future that offers no guarantees, then
the movement from infinite resignation becomes existential political
action]{.underline}**. **[At this point, the crucial meditation would be
on politics and political action. [An attitude of infinite
resignation]{.mark} to the world without the leap of committed action
[would simply be]{.mark} pessimistic or
[nihilistic]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Similarly, **[[an attitude]{.mark}
of hope or [optimism]{.mark} about the future [would lack infinite
resignation]{.mark}. We see here the underlying failure of the two
approaches. Yet ironically, there is a form of failure at failing in the
pessimistic turn versus the optimistic one, since if focused exclusively
on resignation as the goal, then the ''act'' of resignation would have
been achieved, which, paradoxically, would be a success; it would be a
successful failing of failure]{.underline}**. **[[For politics to
emerge]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, **[[there are two missing
elements]{.mark} in inward pessimistic resignation. The [first is that
politics]{.mark} is a social phenomenon]{.underline}**, **[which means
it [requires]{.mark} the [expanding options of a social
world]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Turning away from the social world,
though a statement about politics, is not]{.underline}**, however, **[in
and of itself political]{.underline}**. **[The ancients from whom much
western political theory or philosophy claimed affinity had a
disparaging term for individuals who resigned themselves from political
life]{.underline}**: idio¯te¯s, **[a private person, one not concerned
with public affairs, in a word]{.underline}** -- **[an idiot. I mention
western political theory because that is the hegemonic intellectual
context of Afropessimism]{.underline}**. We don't, however, have to end
our etymological journey in ancient Greek. Extending our linguistic
archaeology back a few thousand years, we could examine the Middle
Kingdom Egyptian word idi (deaf). The presumption, later taken on by the
ancient Athenians and Macedonians, was that a lack of hearing entailed
isolation, at least in terms of audio speech. **[The contemporary inward
[resignation]{.mark} of seeking a form of purity [from the]{.mark}
loathsome [historical reality of racial oppression]{.mark}, in this
reading, [collapses]{.mark} ultimately [into]{.mark} a form of
[moralism]{.mark}]{.underline}** (private, normative satisfaction)
**[[instead of public responsibility]{.mark} born of and borne by
action]{.underline}**. **[[The second]{.mark} is [the importance of
power]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Politics makes no sense without
it.]{.underline}** But what is power? Eurocentric etymology points to
the Latin word potis as its source, from which came the word ''potent''
as in an omnipotent god. If we again look back further, we will notice
the Middle Kingdom (2000 BCE--1700 BCE) KMT/ Egyptian word pHty, which
refers to godlike strength. Yet for those ancient Northeast Africans,
even the gods' abilities came from a source: In the Coffin Texts, HqAw
or heka activates the ka (sometimes translated as soul, spirit, or, in a
word, ''magic''), which makes reality. All **[this amounts to a
straightforward thesis on power as the ability with the means to make
things happen.]{.underline}** **[There is an alchemical quality to
power. The human world, premised on symbolic communication, brings many
forms of meaning into being, and those new meanings afford relationships
that build institutions through a world of culture,]{.underline}** a
phenomenon that Freud (1989) rightly described as ''a prosthetic god.''
It is godlike because it addresses what humanity historically sought
from the gods: protection from the elements, physical maledictions, and
social forms of misery. **[Such power clearly can be abused. It is where
those enabling capacities]{.underline}** (empowerment) **[are pushed to
the wayside in the hording of social resources into propping up some
people as gods that the legitimating practices of cultural cum political
institutions decline and stimulate pessimism and nihilism. That
institutions in the Americas very rarely attempt establishing positive
relations to Blacks is the subtext of Afropessimism and this entire
meditation.]{.underline}** **[The [discussion points]{.mark}, however,
[to]{.mark} a [demand for political commitment]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[[Politics]{.mark} itself emerges under different names throughout the
history of our species, but the one occasioning the word
''politics'']{.underline}** is from the Greek po´lis, which **[[refers
to]{.mark} ancient Hellenic city-states. It identifies [specific]{.mark}
kinds of [activities]{.mark} conducted inside the city-state, [where
order necessitated]{.mark} the [resolution of conflicts through
rules]{.mark} of discourse the violation of which could lead to (civil)
war, a breaking down of relations appropriate for
''outsiders.'']{.underline}** Returning to the Fanonian observation of
selves and others, **[it is clear that imposed limitations on certain
groups amounts to impeding or blocking the option of
politics]{.underline}**. **[Yet, as a problem occurring within the
polity, the problem short of war becomes a political one]{.underline}**.
**[Returning to Afropessimistic challenges, the question becomes this:
[If the problem of antiblack racism is]{.mark} conceded as [political,
where antiblack institutions of power have]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[[as their project, the impeding of Black power]{.mark}, which in
effect requires barring Black access to political
institutions,]{.underline}** **[then [antiblack societies are]{.mark}
ultimately [threats]{.mark} also [to politics]{.mark} [defined as the
human negotiation of the expansion of human capabilities or]{.mark} more
[to]{.mark} the point: [freedom]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Anti-politics
is one of the reasons why societies in which antiblack racism is
hegemonic are also those in which racial moralizing dominates:
moralizing stops at individuals at the expense of addressing
institutions the transformation of which would make immoral individuals
irrelevant.]{.underline}** **[As a political problem, it demands a
political solution. It is not accidental that Blacks continue to be the
continued exemplars of unrealized freedom.]{.underline}** As so many
from Ida B. Wells-Barnett to Angela Davis (2003) and Michelle Alexander
(2010) have shown, **[the expansion of privatization and incarceration
is squarely placed in a structure of states and civil societies premised
on the limitations of freedom]{.underline}** (Blacks) -- **[ironically,
as seen in countries such as South Africa and the United States, in the
name of freedom]{.underline}**. **[That [power is a facilitating]{.mark}
or enabling [phenomenon]{.mark}, a functional element [of the human
world, a viable response must be]{.mark} the [establishing]{.mark} of
[relations that reach beyond the]{.mark} singularity of the
[body]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[I bring this up because [proponents of
Afropessimism]{.mark} might [object to]{.mark} this analysis because of
its [appeal to a human world]{.mark}. If that world is abrogated, the
site of struggle becomes that which is patently not
human]{.underline}**. It is not accidental that popular race discourse
refers today to ''black bodies,'' for instance, instead of ''black
people.'' **[[As the human world is discursive, social, and
relational,]{.mark} this [abandonment amounts to]{.mark} an appeal to
the non-relational, the incommunicability of singularity, and [appeals
to the body]{.mark} and its reach]{.underline}**. At that point, it's
perhaps the psychologist, psychiatrist, or psychoanalyst who would be
helpful, as turning radically inward offers the promise of despair,
narcissistic delusions of godliness, and, as Fanon also observed,
madness. **[Even if that slippery slope were rejected, [the performative
contradiction of attempting to communicate]{.mark} such singularity or
[absence]{.mark} thereof [requires,]{.mark} at least for consistency,
the appropriate course of action: [silence]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
**[[The]{.mark} remaining [question]{.mark} for
Afropessimism,]{.underline}** especially those who are primarily
academics, **[[becomes]{.mark} this: [Why write]{.mark}? It's a question
for which, in both existential and political terms,]{.underline}** I
don't see how an answer could be given from an Afropessimistic
perspective without the unfortunate revelation of cynicism. **[[The
marketability of Afropessimism is]{.mark} no doubt in the immediate and
[paradoxical satisfaction in dissatisfaction]{.mark} it
offers]{.underline}**. **[[We are]{.mark} at this point on familiar
terrain. As with ancient logical paradoxes [denying the viability
of]{.mark} time and motion, [the best option]{.mark}, after a moment of
immobilized reflection, is]{.underline}**, eventually, **[[to move on,
even where the pause is itself significant]{.mark} as an encomium of

#### Their theory of blackness creates a false dichotomy between ending the world or being subjected to it, which homogenizes lived experiences and makes pragmatism impossible

**Kline 17** (David; 2017; Ph.D. candidate at Rice University; Critical
Philosophy of Race, Vol. 5, Issue 1 "The Pragmatics of Resistance:
Framing Anti-Blackness and the Limits of Political Ontology,"
<https://muse.jhu.edu/article/645848>)

[Wilderson's]{.underline} critique of Agamben is certainly correct
within the specific framework of a political ontology of racial
positioning. His [description of anti-Black antagonism shows a powerful
macropolitical sedimentation of]{.underline} \[End Page 56\] [Black
suffering in which Black bodies are ontologically frozen into (non-)
beings]{.underline} that stand in absolute political distinction from
those "who do not magnetize bullets" (Wilderson 2010, 80). In the same
framework, Jared Sexton, whose work is very close to Wilderson's, is
also right when he shows how biopolitical thought---specifically the
Agambenian form centered on questions of sovereignty---and its variant
of "necropolitics" found in Mbembe has so often run aground on the
figure of the slave (see Sexton 2010).5 [[Locating]{.mark} the reality
of [anti-Blackness]{.mark}]{.underline} wholly [[within]{.mark}
this]{.underline} account of [political [ontology does
provide]{.mark}]{.underline} an undeniably [[effective analysis of its
violence]{.underline}]{.mark} and sedimentation over the modern world as
a whole. [However, in terms of a general structure]{.underline}, I
understand [Wilderson's]{.underline} (and Sexton's) political
[ontology]{.underline} to [remain **tied in form** to Agamben's even as
it seemingly discounts it and]{.underline} therefore [remains bound
to]{.underline} some of [the]{.underline} problems and [limitations that
beset such a formal structure]{.underline}, as I'll discuss in a moment.
Despite the critique of Agamben's ontological blind spots regarding the
extent to which Black suffering is non-analogous to non-black suffering,
as I've tried to show, [Wilderson keeps the basic contours
of]{.underline} Agamben's [ontological structure in place, maintaining a
formal political ontology that expands]{.underline} the bottom end of
[the binary structure]{.underline} so as [to locate an **absolute
zero-point** of political abjection within Black social
death]{.underline}. To be clear, this is not to say that the difference
between the content and historicity of Wilderson's social death and
Agamben's bare life does not have profound implications for how
political ontology is conceived or how questions of suffering and
freedom are posed. Nor is it to say that a congruence of formal
structure linking Agamben and Wilderson should mean that their
respective projects are not radically differentiated and perhaps even
opposed in terms of their broader implications and revelations. Rather,
what I want to focus on is how [the [absolute prioritization of
a]{.mark} formal [ontological framework]{.mark} of autonomous and
irreconcilable spheres of positionality]{.underline}---however
descriptively or epistemologically accurate [in terms of]{.underline} a
regime of [ontology and]{.underline} its corresponding macropolitics of
[anti-Blackness]{.underline}---[[ends up **limiting**]{.mark} a whole
range of possible avenues of [analysis]{.mark}]{.underline} that have
their proper site within what Deleuze and Guattari describe as the
micropolitical. The issue here is the distinction between the
macropolitical (molar) and the micropolitical (molecular) fields of
organization and becoming. [Wilderson and Afro-pessimism]{.underline} in
general [privilege [the macropolitical field in which Blackness is
**always already sedimented**]{.mark}]{.underline} and rigidified [into
a political onto-logical position that [**prohibits movement**
and]{.mark} the possibility of what]{.underline} Fred [Moten calls
"fugitivity." The absolute privileging of the
macropolitical]{.underline} as \[End Page 57\] the frame of analysis
[[tends to bracket]{.underline}]{.mark} or overshadow [[the fact that
"every politics is simultaneously]{.mark} a [macro]{.mark}politics
[and]{.mark} a [micro]{.mark}politics]{.underline} (Deleuze and Guattari
1987, 213). Where the macropolitical is structured around a politics of
molarisation that immunizes itself from the threat of contingency and
disruption, the micropolitical names the field in which local and
singular points of connection produce the conditions for "lines of
flight, which are molecular" (ibid., 216). [The micropolitical field is
where movement and resistance happens against or in excess of the
macropolitical in ways not reducible to the kind of formal binary
organization that]{.underline} Agamben and [Wilderson's political
ontology prioritizes]{.underline}. Such resistance is not necessarily
positive or emancipatory, as lines of flight name a contingency that
always poses the risk that whatever develops can become "capable of the
worst" (ibid., 205). However, [within this contingency is also the
possibility of creative lines and deterritorializations that provide
possible means of positive escape from macropolitical
molarisations]{.underline}. Focusing on Wilderson, his absolute
[[prioritization of]{.mark} a political [onto-logical structure]{.mark}
in which the law relegates Black being into the singular position of
social death happens]{.underline}, I contend, at the expense of two
significant things that I am hesitant to bracket for the sake of
prioritizing political ontology as the sole frame of reference for both
analyzing anti-Black racism and thinking resistance within the
racialized world. First, it [[**short-circuits** an analysis]{.mark} of
power [that might reveal]{.mark} not only [how the
practices]{.mark}]{.underline}, forms, [[and apparatuses of anti-Black
racism have historically developed, changed, and
reassembled]{.underline}]{.mark}/reterritorialized [[in relation to
state power, national identity, philosophical]{.underline}]{.mark}
discourse, biological discourse, [[political discourse]{.mark}, and so
on---changes that]{.underline}, despite Wilderson's claim that focusing
on these things only "mystify" the question of ontology (Wilderson 2010,
10), surely [have implications for how racial positioning is both
thought and resisted in differing historical and socio-political
contexts. [To the extent that Blackness equals a]{.mark} singular
[ontological position]{.mark} within a macropolitical structure of
antagonism, [there is]{.mark} almost **[no room]{.mark}** [to bring in
the]{.mark} spectrum and [flow of **social difference and contingency**
that]{.mark} no doubt [spans across Black identity as a]{.mark}
legitimate issue of analysis and as a site/sight for the possibility of
a **[range of resisting practices]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This
bracketing of difference leads him to make some rather sweeping and
opaquely abstract claims. For example, discussing a main character's
abortion in a prison cell in the 1976 film Bush Mama, Wilderson says,
"Dorothy will abort her baby at the clinic or on the floor of her prison
cell, not because she fights for---and either wins \[End Page 58\] or
loses---the right to do so, but because she is one of 35 million
accumulated and fungible (owned and exchangeable) objects living among
230 million subjects---which is to say, her will is always already
subsumed by the will of civil society" (Wilderson 2010, 128, italics
mine). What I want to press here is how
[[Wilderson]{.underline}]{.mark}'s statement, made in the sole frame of
a totalizing political ontology overshadowing all other levels of
sociality, [[flattens]{.mark} out the [social difference within]{.mark},
and even the possibility of, a micropolitical social field of [35
million Black people living in the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates. [[Such]{.mark} a flattening
[reduces]{.mark} the optic of anti-Black racism as well as [Black
sociality to]{.mark} the frame of political ontology where Blackness
remains **stuck in [a singular position]{.mark}** of abjection. The
result is a severe **analytical limitation** in]{.underline} terms of
[the way Blackness]{.underline} (as well as other racial positions)
[exists across an **extremely wide field of sociality**]{.underline}
that is comprised [of differing intensities of forces and relational
modes between various institutional]{.underline}, political,
socio-economic, religious, sexual, [and]{.underline} other [social
conjunctures. Within Wilderson's political ontological
frame]{.underline}, it seems that [these conjunctures are
excluded]{.underline}---or at least bracketed---as having any bearing at
all on how anti-Black power functions and is resisted across highly
differentiated contexts. [[There is only]{.mark} the [binary ontological
distinction]{.mark} of Black and Human being; only a macropolitics of
sedimented abjection]{.underline}. Furthermore, arriving at the second
analytical expense of Wilderson's prioritization of political ontology,
I suggest that [[such]{.mark} a flattening of the social field of
Blackness **[rigidly delimits]{.mark}** what counts as **[legitimate
political resistance]{.mark}**. If the framework for thinking resistance
and the possibility of creating another world is reduced to rigid
ontological positions]{.underline} defined by the absolute power of the
law, [and if Black existence is]{.underline} understood only as
[ontologically fixed at]{.underline} the extreme zero point of [social
death]{.underline} without recourse to anything within its own position
qua Blackness, [then [there is not]{.mark} much [room for]{.mark}
strategizing or even imagining [resistance]{.mark} to anti-Blackness
[that is not **wholly limited to**]{.mark} expressions and events of
**[radically apocalyptic political violence]{.mark}**: the law is either
destroyed entirely, or there is no freedom]{.underline}. This is not to
say that I am necessarily against radical political violence or its use
as an effective tactic. Nor is to say that I think the law should be
left unchallenged in its total operation, but rather that [[there might
be]{.mark} other and more [**pragmatically oriented practices of
resistance** that do not]{.mark} necessarily [have the absolute
destruction of the law]{.mark} as their immediate aim [that **should
count as genuine** resistance to anti-Blackness]{.mark}.]{.underline}
For Wilderson, like Agamben, [anything less than an absolute
overturning]{.underline} \[End Page 59\] [of the order of things, the
violent]{.underline} destruction and [annihilation of the full structure
of antagonisms, is deemed as "\[having nothing\] to do with Black
liberation"]{.underline} (quoted in Zug 2010). [Of course]{.underline},
the desire for the absolute overturning of the currently existing world,
the decisive end of the existing world and [the arrival of a new world
in which "Blacks do not magnetize bullets" should be absolutely
affirmed]{.underline}. Further, the severity and gratuitous nature of
the macropolitics of anti-Blackness in relation to the possibility of a
movement towards freedom should not be bracketed or displaced for the
sake of appealing to any non-Black grammar of exploitation or alienation
(Wilderson 2010, 142). [The question]{.underline} I want to pose,
[however]{.underline}, [is how the **insistence** on [the
absolute]{.mark} priority of [framing]{.mark} this world within a rigid
structure of formal ontological positions [can only revert to]{.mark}
what amounts to [a]{.mark} kind of [negative]{.mark}]{.underline}
theological and [[**eschatological blank horizon** in which **actually
existing**]{.mark} social sites and modes of [**resisting praxis** are
**displaced** and **devalued** by notions of whatever]{.mark} it is that
[might arrive from beyond]{.mark}]{.underline}. It seems that Wilderson,
again, is close to Agamben on this point, whose ontological structure
also severely delimits what might count as genuine resistance to the
regime of sovereignty. As Dominick [LaCapra points out]{.underline}
regarding the possibility of liberation outside of Agamben's formal
ontological structure of bare life and sovereignty, A further enigmatic
conjunction in Agamben is between pure possibility and the reduction of
being to mere or naked life, for it is the emergence of mere naked life
in accomplished [nihilism]{.underline} that simultaneously
[generates]{.underline}, as a kind of miraculous antibody or creation ex
nihilo, pure possibility or [utterly blank utopianism not limited by the
constraints of the past or by normative structures of any
sort]{.underline}. (LaCapra 2009, 168) [With life's ontological
reduction to]{.underline} the abjection of bare life or [social death,
the only possible way out]{.underline}, it [seems]{.underline}, is the
impossible possibility of what Agamben refers to as the "suspension of
the suspension," the laying aside of the distinction between bare life
and political life, the "Shabbat of both animal and man" (Agamben 2003,
92). It is in this sense that Agamben offers, again in the words of
LaCapra, a "negative theology in extremis . . . [an empty utopianism of
pure, unlimited possibility]{.underline}" (LaCapra 2009, 166). [The
result is a discounting and devaluing of other]{.underline}, perhaps
[more pragmatic and less eschatological, practices of resistance. [With
the "all or nothing"]{.mark}]{.underline} \[End Page 60\]
[[approach]{.mark} that posits anything less than the absolute
suspension of the current state of things as unable to address the
violence]{.underline} and abjection of bare life, [[there is not much
left]{.mark} in which to appeal [than a]{.mark} kind of
**[apocalyptic]{.mark}**]{.underline}, messianic, and contentless
eschatological **[[future space defined by whatever this world is
not]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### Pragmatism's crucial to counter biopolitical governance and political ontology -- this requires working against and within structures that shape blackness 

**Kline 17** (David; 2017; Ph.D. candidate at Rice University; Critical
Philosophy of Race, Vol. 5, Issue 1 "The Pragmatics of Resistance:
Framing Anti-Blackness and the Limits of Political Ontology,"
<https://muse.jhu.edu/article/645848>)

As I've argued, Wilderson's flattening of Black social heterogeneity and
the narrowing of any possibility of resistance outside the total
apocalyptic destruction of the existing world is a result of his
political ontology and macropolitics of racial positions revolving
around the formal poles of Master/Human and social death. **[The
delimitation of social and political possibility happens both in terms
of Black and non-Black resistance to the structure of the racialized
world]{.underline}**. Of course, I do not want to argue for a coalition
politics or any kind of reconciliatory framework that would find a
solution to anti-Blackness in some form of liberal multiculturalism or
"colorblindness" that ignores the real and particular violence of white
antagonism. **[I]{.underline}** do, however, **[want to argue for the
sheer possibility of opening or breaking through the
closure]{.underline}**(s), **[of lines of flight that mark a
multiplicity of encounters and possibilities between forces,
technologies, bodies]{.underline}**, and what Foucault calls dispositifs
**[that run across varying positions and social sites that are not
wholly reducible to fixed ontological positions and which potentially
provide connections and flows that break through to an outside of
political ontological sedimentation]{.underline}**. **[[Focusing on how
the dispositifs of biopolitical forms of
governance]{.underline}]{.mark}**---**[[as opposed to]{.mark} the
[legal]{.mark} [and]{.mark} formal [ontological structure of
sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[[take into account "processes of
life" as the basis for governance]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Foucault
theorizes what he calls the "aleatory" body that is the target of
biopower and exists prior to any imposition of governance or domination.
Appealing to the "freedom" of the aleatory body is not some kind of
idealized notion of the body that ignores the macropolitical fact of
Black suffering's undeniable gratuitous nature. **[This is not an appeal
to what Sexton calls the "in spite of the terror"]{.underline}**
argument, where notions of Black freedom are understood merely as a kind
of concession to the deeper realities at hand (Sexton 2010, 35).
**[Rather, [it is to start with the]{.mark} basic fact of the material
[body in space and time]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the idea [that "resistance
comes first]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (Foucault 1997, 167). \[End Page
61\] **[This point is particularly salient within the biopolitical frame
because]{.underline}**, as Deleuze puts it, "**[[when power becomes
biopower resistance becomes the power of life]{.mark}, a vital power
that cannot be confined within species, environment or the paths of a
particular diagram]{.underline}**" (Deleuze 1988, 92). In other words,
**[resistance is the micropolitical force of life that can never be
fully confined or contained within a political ontological frame (or
diagram) of antagonisms]{.underline}**.6 In terms of Wilderson's
ontology of social positioning, we might say, following Foucault and
Deleuze into Fred Moten's Black optimism,7 that Black (aleatory) life
always already precedes the gratuitous violence of an antagonism.
Blackness, then, is not wholly reducible to a political ontological
position, but rather is the movement prior to and against the imposing
force of any violent constitution---or, as Nathanial Mackey says, that
"insistent previousness evading each and every natal occasion" (Mackey
1986, 34). **[Even though an antagonism functions as the political
ontological constitution of a Black being as socially dead in relation
to civil society, [there is still an even deeper level that precedes
ontological constitution itself: the movement and resistance of Black
life]{.mark}]{.underline}**.8 In In the Break: The Aesthetics of the
Black Radical Tradition, Moten makes inseparable Blackness and
resistance with this provocative opening sentence: "**[the
[history]{.mark} of blackness [is]{.mark} a [testament to the fact that
objects can and do resist]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (Moten 2003, 1).
Flowing in the vein of Adorno's anti-identitarian negative dialectics
and its prioritization of the object, Moten reads the history of
Blackness, which for him is nothing other than a history of certain
performativity as improvisation, as a history of the object's absolute
objection to the capture of identity, the fugitive drive towards freedom
where an untraceable, stateless, and ungoverned life of "improvisational
immanence" is always becoming (ibid., 255n1). **[Not ignoring or
bracketing the problem of political ontological
antagonism]{.underline}** (although he does reject describing it in
terms of social death), **[he nevertheless opens the frame of analysis
and social possibility to the aleatory field of life itself, or,
micropolitics]{.underline}**. **[[Tracing the Black radical tradition
through everything from its poetry to its music to its banal
everydayness,]{.mark} Moten shows Blackness as a counter-force sparked
into movement by the imposing and regulating force of anti-Black
power]{.underline}**. **[In]{.underline}** critical yet sympathetic
**[opposition to Wilderson and other Afro-pessimists]{.underline}**,
**[Moten rejects the notion that a full analysis of Blackness should be
reduced to the imposition of social death]{.underline}**. Or, to put it
another way, Moten rejects the notion that Blackness is reduced to a
fixed ontological position within a macropolitics that has no recourse
to \[End Page 62\] forms of life that might resist and evade the
imposition of an antagonism. Rather, **[Blackness is a counter-force to
ontology itself]{.underline}**. As he puts it, **[blackness \[is not
(just)\] ontologically prior to the logistic and regulative power that
is supposed to have brought it into existence but]{.underline}** . . .
**[blackness is prior to ontology]{.underline}**; or in a slight
variation of what \[Nahum\] Chandler would say, blackness is the
anoriginal displacement of ontology, that it is ontology's anti- and
ante-foundation, ontology's underground, the irreparable disturbance of
ontology's time and space. (Moten 2014, 739) Here, Moten is riffing on
Chandler's idea of "paraontology," which is in specific distinction from
political ontology. Paraontology, as Moten describes it, is "the
transformative pressure blackness puts on philosophical concepts,
categories, and methods" (Moten 2008, 215n3). **[Rather than an account
of being that seeks to uncover an essence or totalizing account of a
particular social or political position]{.underline}**, paraontology
describes the mode of being that is always already resisting the
imposing logic of (political) ontology. Chandler articulates this
phenomenon through Du Bois' double consciousness, honing in on the "in
between" of its double identity. As he says, "between" would delimit any
simple notion of its spatiality or presupposed relationality. It would
instead accede to the most general disruption of boundaries. . . .
"\[B\]etween" dissipates any simple notion of inside and outside, of
above and below. . . . Du Bois's inscription may be understood to name
the opening of the sense of space, of spaciality, rather than confirm
it. (Chandler 2014, 6--7) Chandler is describing the way
**[Blackness---in all of its social scope and complexity---overflows or
breaks open the boundaries of any formal imposition, the way Blackness
cannot be reduced to a frame of abjection or the irreconcilable position
of an antagonism]{.underline}**. From this perspective, **[Blackness is
a rhizome, a dynamic, creative, and desiring counter-force in which
lines of flight present possible modes of freedom and sociality in
excess to political ontological positioning]{.underline}**. As a
paraontological phenomenon, Chandler and Moten understand Blackness as a
unique and specific exertion within modernity---which might also be
called the historical regime of racial political ontology---that
challenges every schema of formalization and \[End Page 63\] positional
fixity. In this way, from this vantage, **[the history of Blackness is
read as a history of a certain performativity of the drive towards a
freedom not determined by the terms or boundaries of ontology, as a
history of the object's absolute objection to the macropolitical capture
of identity]{.underline}**. This paraontological movement of Black
fugitivity, as Moten has coined it, calls into question the framing of
Blackness wholly within a political ontology that seeks to index and
describe Black life in terms of pure abjection. Again, Moten and
Chandler do not in any way downplay the abjection to which Blackness is
given in the modern world. Indeed, Moten considers his project and that
of Afro-pessimism as two sides of a mutual project where "Black optimism
and Afro-pessimism are asymptotic" (Moten 2014, 778). Yet, **[by
insisting on the possibilities of Black life within an immanent and
micropolitical field of becoming that moves in resistance to a rigid
political ontology of social death, Moten taps into something vital that
precedes the force of imposition, the force of law, or the force of the
structure of White supremacy and its sedimented political ontological
order]{.underline}**. In this way, he also expands the frame of analysis
and praxis so that a much wider field of resources and possibilities are
available in terms of a project of liberation that goes beyond the
political ontological frame. This is where **[[I suggest the
decentering]{.mark} of [political ontology]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [the
inclusion of the Black]{.mark} aleatory [body]{.mark} as the site of
struggle, evasion, and creation [becomes a pragmatic mode of
framing]{.mark} the problem [and]{.mark} thinking [a purely practical
politics]{.mark} [of]{.mark} both [spontaneous creation and]{.mark} a
[calculated movement against the political ontological regime of
anti-Blackness]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Although **[Moten]{.underline}**
would certainly object to describing this turn by way of a "pragmatic
politics," I suggest that **[his "Black optimism" and Chandler's
paraontology find congruence]{.underline}** with a kind of
Foucaultian-Deleuzian pragmatics which, as Paul Patton describes
Deleuze's philosophy, "\[enables\] **[a form of description which is
immediately practical" and an "ethico-political conception of philosophy
as oriented towards the possibility of change]{.underline}**" (Patton
2003, 16, 17). From this angle, **[the accurate representation of [an
ontological reality]{.mark}, while certainly necessary and crucial to
the task of naming the full scope of the problem and thinking a way
forward, [does not take precedence over the task of creating new
concepts and lines of flight that should be judged on their
effectiveness not in terms of properly representing an ontological
problem, but in terms of their concrete effects within a wide field of
contexts, specific socio-political problems, and
conjunctures]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As Deleuze and Guattari describe
how pragmatics marks a study attuned to the complexity, \[End Page 64\]
contingency, and potential danger that defines the micropolitical, "the
study of the dangers of each line is the object of pragmatics or
schizoanalysis, to the extent that it undertakes not to represent,
interpret, or symbolize, but only to make maps and draw lines, marking
their mixtures as well as their distinctions" (Deleuze and Guattari
1987, 227). **[[Pragmatics]{.mark}, in this way, [is]{.mark} all [about
drawing lines and making maps]{.mark} [against]{.mark}
[macropolitical]{.mark} sedimentations that lead somewhere, that create
something new]{.underline}**. **[Such pragmatic orientation is
especially pertinent in the contemporary biopolitical
frame]{.underline}** as Foucault understands it. As I've already
described, Foucault's biopolitics is premised on the idea that when
politics takes the biological body as its primary aim and object, as
opposed to sovereign power's object of the legal subject and its
constitutive negative, then there is introduced into politics the
possibility, as Cary Wolfe notes, "for life to burst through power's
systematic operations in ways that are more and more difficult to
anticipate" (Wolfe 2014, 158). **[The [increasing complexity of bodily
knowledge]{.mark} and the power that takes this knowledge as its
operating principle [means that both risk and possibility increase in
terms of what the body can do and what can be done to the
body]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The pragmatic thrust of this emerges
when situating it at the level of micropolitics]{.underline}**, where,
as I've been describing, Deleuze and Guattari locate the conditions for
lines of flight and where "there is always something that flows or
flees, that escapes the binary organizations, the resonance apparatus,
and the overcoding machine" (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 216). Out of any
sedimentation there will always be deterritorialization and
reterritorialization. **[[The pragmatic possibility or
potential]{.mark}, then, [is that there is always a simultaneity of the
micropolitical and the macropolitical that provides the conditions for
an ongoing search for new tactics]{.mark}, orientations, assemblages,
vocabularies, and processes of becoming [that are aimed practically
towards change]{.mark}]{.underline}**: "What matters is to break through
the wall, even if one has to become-black like John Brown. George
Jackson. 'I may take flight, but all the while I am fleeing, I will be
looking for a weapon!" (Deleuze and Guattari 2009, 277). This emphasis
on pragmatics and lines of flight---both in potentially negative and
positive terms (i.e. in terms of pure contingency)---provides a much
more expansive level for framing the problem of anti-Blackness that is
not reducible to fixed political ontological positions and the
macropolitical plane. Finally, I suggest this kind of pragmatics is what
Moten and Harney describe as "fugitive planning and Black study," what
Jack Halberstam \[End Page 65\] characterizes simply as "**[reaching out
to find connection]{.underline}**" (Moten and Harney 2013, 5).
**[[Pragmatics]{.mark} finds a footing in the highly dynamic and
shifting terrain of power relations and its multiplicity of conjunctures
that signal the condition of movement and connection]{.underline}**.
**[It [finds]{.mark} its [enactment in sites]{.mark} [such
as]{.mark}]{.underline}** "**[the]{.underline}** little Negro's
**[church and logos and [gathering]{.mark}]{.underline}**, this
gathering **[[in and against the word]{.underline}]{.mark}**, alongside
and through the word and the world as hold, manger, wilderness, tomb,
upper room, and cell" (Moten 2014, 775). Within these and other sites of
micropolitical connection and the practices that take place in them,
**[there is flight, resistance, and the creation of something new and
productive]{.underline}**. **[The [inclusion]{.mark} [of]{.mark} these
[sites and practices within the analytical frame and critique of
anti-Blackness provide a much wider set of resources for thinking the
complexity of the full scope of the political field that exists in
excess to the political ontological frame]{.mark}, and]{.underline}**,
in the same way, **[orients the fight against anti-Blackness in
practical]{.underline}** (though potentially no less revolutionary),
**[rather than apocalyptic, terms]{.underline}**. This, I argue, does
not have to mitigate or pass over Sexton's call that "slavery must be
theorized maximally if its abolition is to reach the proper level"
(Sexton 2011, 33). **[The maximum theorization of slavery and
anti-Blackness does not need be completely hedged in by a political
ontological frame.]{.underline}** However, **[analytical expansion
beyond the political ontological frame does mean locating a positive
emphasis on what Sexton disparagingly identifies as a tendency towards
"forces of mitigation that would transform the world through a coalition
of a thousand tiny causes"]{.underline}** (ibid.). Taking Sexton's (and
Wilderson's) call of a maximum theorization of slavery/anti-Blackness
with full seriousness, I wonder what the proper level of abolition could
possibly mean other than **[a pragmatic coalition]{.underline}**---or a
micropolitics---of a thousand tiny causes. As I've argued, thinking what
this might mean **[would certainly necessitate an expansive analytics of
power relations flowing over a highly complex field of forces,
intensities, technologies, and dispositifs]{.underline}** that together
form a micropolitical field far in excess of sovereign power and the
political ontological frame. **[Out of such an analytics[, a pragmatics
that finds its possibility in the micropolitical field of movement and
flight emerges as the condition for an ongoing life of resistance,
connection, and a movement toward freedom]{.mark}]{.underline}**. \[End

#### Antiblackness is not ontological -- it's predicated on a multitude of contingencies. Policy action's crucial to combat structures that maintain antiblackness and white supremacy 

**Bouie 13** (Jamelle Bouie, Jamelle Bouie is chief political
correspondent for Slate Magazine, and a political analyst for CBS News.
He covers campaigns, elections, and national affairs., 3/11/13, "Making
(and Dismantling) Racism," The American Prospect,
<http://prospect.org/article/making-and-dismantling-racism>)

Over at The Atlantic, Ta-Nehisi Coates has been exploring the
intersection of race and public policy, with a focus on white supremacy
as a driving force in political decisions at all levels of government.
This has led him to two conclusions: First, that **[[anti-black
racism]{.mark} as we understand it [is a creation of]{.mark} explicit
[policy choices]{.mark}---the decision to exclude, marginalize, and
stigmatize Africans and their descendants has as much to do with racial
prejudice as does any intrinsic tribalism]{.underline}**. And second,
that **[it\'s possible to dismantle this prejudice using public
policy]{.underline}**. Here is Coates in his own words: Last night I had
the luxury of sitting and talking with the brilliant historian Barbara
Fields. One point she makes that very few Americans understand is that
racism is a creation. You read Edmund Morgan's work and actually see
racism being inscribed in the law and the country changing as a result.
**[[If we accept that racism is a creation]{.mark}, then we must then
accept that it can be destroyed]{.underline}**. And **[if we accept that
it can be destroyed, [we must then accept that it can be destroyed by
us]{.mark} and that it likely must be destroyed by methods kin to
creation.]{.underline}** **[Racism was created by policy. [It
will]{.mark} likely [only be]{.mark} ultimately [destroyed by
policy]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Over at his blog, Andrew Sullivan offers
a reply: I don't believe the law created racism any more than it can
create lust or greed or envy or hatred. It can encourage or mitigate
these profound aspects of human psychology -- it can create racist
structures as in the Jim Crow South or Greater Israel. But it can no
more end these things that it can create them. A complementary strategy
is finding ways for the targets of such hatred to become inured to them,
to let the slurs sting less until they sting not at all. Not easy. But a
more manageable goal than TNC's utopianism. I can appreciate the point
Sullivan is making, but I\'m not sure it\'s relevant to Coates\'
argument. It is absolutely true that \"Group loyalty is deep in our
DNA,\" as Sullivan writes. And if you define racism as an overly
aggressive form of group loyalty---basically just prejudice---then
Sullivan is right to throw water on the idea that the law can \"create
racism any more than it can create lust or greed or envy or hatred.\"
But **[Coates is making a more precise claim]{.underline}**: That
**[[there\'s nothing natural about the black/white divide]{.mark} that
has defined American history.]{.underline}** **[[White Europeans had
contact with black Africans]{.mark} well [before the trans-Atlantic
slave trade without]{.mark} the emergence of an [anti-black
racism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[It]{.mark} took particular [choices
made by]{.mark} particular people---in this case, [plantation
owners]{.mark} in colonial Virginia---[to make black skin a
stigma]{.mark}, to make the \"one drop rule\" a defining feature of
American life for more than a hundred years. By enslaving African
indentured servants and allowing their white counterparts a chance for
upward mobility, colonial landowners began the process that would make
white supremacy the ideology of America]{.underline}**. **[The position
of slavery generated a stigma that then justified continued
enslavement---]{.underline}**blacks are lowly, therefore we must keep
them as slaves. Slavery (and later, Jim Crow) wasn\'t built to reflect
racism as much as it was built in tandem with it. **[[And later
policy]{.mark}, in the late 19th and 20th centuries, [further entrenched
white supremacist attitudes]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Block black people
from owning homes, and they\'re forced to reside in crowded slums.
Onlookers then use the reality of slums to deny homeownership to blacks,
under the view that they\'re unfit for suburbs.

Through the triple mechanism of capture, removal, and objectification,
**[the [slave was]{.mark} forcibly [locked within a system that
prevented]{.mark} ~~him~~ [\[them\] from freely making]{.mark} of
~~his~~ [\[their\] life]{.mark}---and from ~~his~~ life---[something
true]{.mark}]{.underline}**, something with its own consistency that
could stand on its own. **[Everything produced by the slave was taken
from ~~him~~]{.underline}**: the products of his labor, offspring, the
work of his mind. He authored nothing that fully belonged to him.
**[Slaves were considered mere merchandise, objects of luxury or utility
to be bought and sold to others. [At the same time]{.mark}, however,
[they were human beings endowed with the ability to speak, capable of
creating and using tools.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Often deprived of
family ties, they were deprived as well of inheritance and of the
enjoyment of the fruits of their own labor. Those to whom they belonged,
and who extracted their unpaid labor, denied them their full humanity.
**[Yet, [on a purely ontological level]{.mark} at least, [their humanity
was never entirely erased. They constituted]{.mark}, by the force of
things, [a supplemental humanity engaged in constant struggle to escape
imprisonment]{.mark} and repetition, and [driven]{.mark} by a desire [to
return to the place where autonomous creation had]{.mark} once [been
possible.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The **[suspended humanity of the slave
was defined by the fact that ~~he was~~ [\[they were\] condemned to
reconstitute]{.mark} ~~himself~~ [\[themselves\] perpetually, to
announce]{.mark} ~~his~~ [\[their\] radical]{.mark}, unsinkable
[desire]{.mark}, and [to seek liberty]{.mark} or vengeance. This was
especially true when the enslaved refused the radical abdication of the
subject that was demanded of them.]{.underline}** Although legally
defined as movable property, **[[slaves always remained human,]{.mark}
despite the cruelty, degradation, and dehumanization directed at them.
Through their labor in service of the master, [they continued to create
a world. Through]{.mark} gesture and [speech, they wove relationships
and a universe of meaning, inventing languages, religions,
dances]{.mark}, and [rituals and creating
"community."]{.mark}]{.underline}**18 **[Their destitution and the
abjection to which they were subjected never entirely eliminated their
capacity to create symbols.]{.underline}** By its very existence, the
**[community of the enslaved constantly tore at the veil of hypocrisy
and lies in which slave-owning societies clothed
themselves.]{.underline}** The **[[slaves were capable of rebellion
and]{.mark} at times [disposed of their own lives]{.mark} through
suicide, thus [dispossessing their masters of their so-called
property]{.mark} and de facto abolishing the link of servitude. Those
who were burdened with the name "Black" were forcibly placed in a world
apart, yet [they retained]{.mark} the [characteristics that made them
human beyond subjection]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Over time **[[they
produced ways of thinking]{.mark} and languages [that were truly their
own]{.mark}. They invented their own literatures, music, and ways of
celebrating the divine. They were forced to found their own
institutions---schools, newspapers, political organizations, a public
sphere dif­ferent from the official public sphere.]{.underline}** To a
large extent, **[the term "Black" is the sign of minoritization and
confinement.]{.underline}** It is an island of repose in the midst of
racial oppression and objective dehumanization.

#### Reducing black people to fungible bodies and reading their experiences through pain creates the worst form of depoliticization -- not only do they disregard black agency and resistance, they further perpetuate a narrative of white domination

Second only to a desire for increased diversity, better mental health
services were a chief priority for student protesters. Activists framed
their concerns and grievances in the language of personal trauma. We
shouldn't be surprised. While every generation of black Americans has
experienced unrelenting violence, this is the first one compelled to
witness virtually all of it, to endure the snuffing out of black lives
in real time, looped over and over again, until the next murder knocks
it off the news. **[We are also talking about a generation that has
lived through two of the longest wars in U.S. history, raised on a
culture of spectacle where horrific acts of violence are readily
available]{.underline}** on their smartphones. What Henry **[Giroux
insightfully identifies as an addiction does nothing to inure or
desensitize young people to violence]{.underline}**. On the contrary, it
anchors violence in their collective consciousness, produces fear and
paranoia -- wrapped elegantly in thrill -- and shrouds the many ways
capitalism, militarism, and racism are killing black and brown people.
So **[one can easily see why the language of trauma might appeal to
black students. Trauma is real; it is no joke]{.underline}**. Mental
health services and counseling are urgently needed. **[But [reading
black experience through trauma can easily slip into thinking of
ourselves as victims and objects rather than agents, subjected
to]{.mark} centuries of [gratuitous violence that have structured and
overdetermined our]{.mark} very [being]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In the
argot of our day, "**[[bodies]{.mark}" -- [vulnerable and
threatening]{.mark} bodies -- [increasingly stand in for]{.mark} actual
[people with names, experiences, dreams, and
desires]{.mark}]{.underline}**. I suspect that the popularity of
Ta-Nehisi Coates's Between the World and Me (2015), especially among
black college students, rests on his singular emphasis on fear, trauma,
and the black body. He writes: "In America, it is traditional to destroy
the black body---it is heritage. Enslavement was not merely the
antiseptic borrowing of labor---it is not so easy to get a human being
to commit their body against its own elemental interest. And so
enslavement must be casual wrath and random manglings, the gashing of
heads and brains blown out over the river as the body seeks to escape.
It must be rape so regular as to be industrial. . . . The spirit and
soul are the body and brain, which are destructible---that is precisely
why they are so precious. And the soul did not escape. The spirit did
not steal away on gospel wings." **[Coates]{.underline}** implies that
the person is the brain, and the brain just another organ to be crushed
with the rest of the body's parts. Earlier in the book, he **[makes the
startling declaration that enslaved people "knew nothing but
chains.]{.underline}**" **[I do not deny the violence Coates so
eloquently describes]{.underline}** here, and I am sympathetic to his
atheistic skepticism. **[But [what sustained enslaved African people was
a memory of freedom, dreams of seizing it, and conspiracies to enact it
]{.mark}]{.underline}**-- fugitive planning, if you will. **[[If we
reduce the enslaved to]{.mark} mere [fungible bodies, we cannot]{.mark}
possibly [understand how they created families, communities, sociality;
how they fled]{.mark} and [loved]{.mark} and [worshiped]{.mark} [and
defended themselves]{.mark}; [how they created the world's first social
democracy]{.mark}.]{.underline}** "**[[Trauma is real. But reading black
experience through trauma can lead to thinking of ourselves as victims
rather than agents.]{.mark}"]{.underline}** Moreover, **[[to identify
anti-black violence as heritage]{.mark} may be true in a general sense,
but it [obscures the dialectic that produced]{.mark} and reproduced [the
violence of a regime dependent on black life for]{.mark} its
[profitability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[It was]{.mark}, after all,
[the resisting black body that needed
"correction]{.mark}]{.underline}**." Violence was used not only to break
bodies but to discipline people who refused enslavement. And the impulse
to resist is neither involuntary nor solitary. **[It is a choice made in
community, made possible by community, and informed by memory,
tradition, and witness. If Africans were entirely compliant and docile,
there would have been no need for vast expenditures on corrections,
security, and violence. [Resistance is our
heritage]{.mark}.]{.underline}** And **[[resistance is our
healing]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Through collective struggle, **[[we
alter our circumstances]{.mark}; [contain, escape, or]{.mark} possibly
[eviscerate]{.mark} the source of [trauma]{.mark}; [recover our bodies;
reclaim]{.mark} and redeem [our dead; and make ourselves
whole]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It is difficult to see this in a world
where words such as trauma, PTSD, micro-aggression, and triggers have
virtually replaced oppression, repression, and subjugation. Naomi
Wallace, a brilliant playwright whose work explores trauma in the
context of race, sexuality, class, war, and empire, muses: "Mainstream
America is less threatened by the 'trauma' theory because it doesn't
place economic justice at its core and takes the focus out of the realm
of justice and into psychology; out of the streets, communities, into
the singular experience (even if experienced in common) of the
individual." Similarly, George Lipsitz observes that **[emphasizing
"interiority," personal pain, and feeling elevates "the cultivation of
sympathy over the creation of social justice." This is partly why
demands for reparations to address historical and ongoing racism are so
antithetical to modern liberalism.]{.underline}** "**[Through collective
struggle, we alter our circumstances; contain, escape, or possibly
eviscerate the source of trauma]{.underline}**." **[[Managing trauma
does not require dismantling structural racism]{.mark},]{.underline}**
which is why university administrators focus on avoiding triggers rather
than implementing zero-tolerance policies for racism or sexual assault.
Buildings will be renamed and safe spaces for people of color will be
created out of a sliver of university real estate, but proposals to
eliminate tuition and forgive student debt for the descendants of the
dispossessed and the enslaved will be derided as absurd. This is also
why diversity and cultural-competency training are the most popular
strategies for addressing campus racism. As if racism were a
manifestation of our "incompetent" handling of "difference." If we
cannot love the other, we can at least learn to hear, respect,
understand, and "tolerate" her. Cultural competency also means reckoning
with white privilege, coming to terms with unconscious bias and the
myriad ways white folks benefit from current racial arrangements.
Powerful as this might be, the solution to racism still is shifted to
the realm of self-help and human resources, resting on self-improvement
or the hiring of a consultant or trainer to help us reach our goal.
Cultural-competency training, greater diversity, and demands for
multicultural curricula represent both a resistance to and manifestation
of our current "postracial" moment. In Are We All Postracial Yet?
(2015), David Theo Goldberg correctly sees postracialism as a neoliberal
revision of multicultural discourse, whose proposed remedies to address
racism would in fact resuscitate late-century multiculturalism. But why
hold on to the policies and promises of multiculturalism and diversity,
especially since they have done nothing to dislodge white supremacy?
Indeed I want to suggest that the triumph of multiculturalism marked a
defeat for a radical anti-racist vision. True, multiculturalism emerged
in response to struggles waged by the Black Freedom movement and other
oppressed groups in the 1960s and '70s. But the programmatic adoption of
diversity, inclusion, and multiculturalism vampirized the energy of a
radical movement that began by demanding the complete transformation of
the social order and the eradication of all forms of racial, gender,
sexual, and class hierarchy. The point of liberal multiculturalism was
not to address the historical legacies of racism, dispossession, and
injustice but rather to bring some people into the fold of a "society no
longer seen as racially unjust." What did it bring us? Black elected
officials and black CEOs who helped manage the greatest transfer of
wealth to the rich and oversee the continued erosion of the welfare
state; the displacement, deportation, and deterioration of black and
brown communities; mass incarceration; and planetary war. We talk about
breaking glass ceilings in corporate America while building more jail
cells for the rest. The triumph of liberal multiculturalism also meant a
shift from a radical anti-capitalist critique to a politics of
recognition. This means, for example, that we now embrace the right of
same-sex couples to marry so long as they do not challenge the
institution itself, which is still modeled upon the exchanging of
property; likewise we accept the right of people of color, women, and
queer people to serve in the military, killing and torturing around the
world. "I want to suggest that the triumph of multiculturalism marked a
defeat for a radical anti-racist vision." At the same time, contemporary
calls for cultural competence and tolerance reflect neoliberal logic by
emphasizing individual responsibility and suffering, shifting race from
the public sphere to the psyche. The postracial, Goldberg writes,
"renders individuals solely accountable for their own actions and
expressions, not for their group's." Tolerance in its multicultural
guise, as Wendy Brown taught us, is the liberal answer to managing
difference but with no corresponding transformation in the conditions
that, in the first place, marked certain bodies as suspicious, deviant,
abject, or illegible. Tolerance, therefore, depoliticizes genuine
struggles for justice and power: **[[Depoliticization involves
construing inequality, subordination, marginalization, and social
conflict, which]{.mark} all [require political analysis and political
solutions,]{.mark} as personal and individual, on the one hand, or as
natural, religious, or cultural on the other.]{.underline}** Tolerance
works along both vectors of depoliticization -- it personalizes and it
naturalizes or culturalizes -- and sometimes it intertwines them. But
**[how can we embrace our students and acknowledge their pain while
remaining wary of a culture that reduces structural oppression to
misunderstanding and psychology]{.underline}**? Love, Study, Struggle
Taped inside the top drawer of my desk is a small scrap of paper with
three words scrawled across it: "**[Love, Study,
Struggle]{.underline}**." It serves as a daily reminder of what I am
supposed to be doing. **[[Black]{.mark} study and [resistance]{.mark}
[must begin with]{.mark} love.]{.underline}** James Baldwin understood
love-as-agency probably better than anyone. For him it meant to love
ourselves as black people; it meant making love the motivation for
making revolution; it meant **[[envisioning a society where]{.mark}
everyone is embraced, where [there is no oppression]{.mark},
[where]{.mark} [every life is valued]{.mark} -- [even those who]{.mark}
may once [have been our oppressors]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It did not
mean seeking white people's love and acceptance or seeking belonging in
the world created by our oppressor. In The Fire Next Time (1963), he is
unequivocal: "I do not know many Negroes who are eager to be 'accepted'
by white people, still less to be loved by them; they, the blacks,
simply don't wish to be beaten over the head by the whites every instant
of our brief passage on this planet." But here is the catch: if we are
committed to genuine freedom, we have no choice but to love all. To love
all is to fight relentlessly to end exploitation and oppression
everywhere, even on behalf of those who think they hate us. This was
Baldwin's point -- perhaps his most misunderstood and reviled point.
**[To love this way requires relentless struggle, deep study, and
critique]{.underline}**. **[[Limiting our ambit to suffering,
resistance, and achievement is not enough]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[We
must go to the root -- the historical, political, social, cultural,
ideological, material, economic root -- of oppression in order to
understand its negation, the prospect of our liberation]{.underline}**.
Going to the root illuminates what is hidden from us, largely because
most structures of oppression and all of their various entanglements are
simply not visible and not felt. For example, **[[if we argue that state
violence is merely a manifestation of anti-blackness because that is
what we see and feel, we are left with no theory of the state
and]{.mark} have [no way of understanding racialized police violence in
places]{.mark} such as Atlanta and Detroit, [where most cops are
black]{.mark}, unless we turn to some metaphysical
explanation.]{.underline}** For my generation, the formal classroom was
never the space for deep critique precisely because it was not a place
of love. The classroom was -- and still is -- a performative space,
where faculty and students compete with each other. Through study
groups, we created our own intellectual communities held together by
principle and love, though the specters of sectarianism, ego, and
just-plain childishness blurred our vision and threatened our
camaraderie. Still, the political study group was our lifeblood -- both
on and off campus. We lived by Karl Marx's pithy 1844 statement: "But if
the designing of the future and the proclamation of ready-made solutions
for all time is not our affair, then we realize all the more clearly
what we have to accomplish in the present -- I am speaking of a ruthless
criticism of everything existing, ruthless in two senses: The criticism
must not be afraid of its own conclusions, nor of conflict with the
powers that be." "If we argue that state violence is merely a
manifestation of anti-blackness because that is what we see and feel, we
are left with no theory of the state and have no way of understanding
racialized police violence." Study groups introduced me to C. L. R.
James, Frantz Fanon, Walter Rodney, Barbara Smith, Angela Davis, Karl
Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin, Chancellor Williams, George E.
M. James, Shulamith Firestone, Kwame Nkrumah, Kwame Turé, Rosa
Luxemburg, Antonio Gramsci, Chinweizu Ibekwe, Amílcar Cabral, and
others. These texts were our sources of social critique and weapons in
our class war on the bourgeois canon. As self-styled
activist-intellectuals, it never occurred to us to refuse to read a text
simply because it validated the racism, sexism, free-market ideology,
and bourgeois liberalism against which we railed. Nothing was off
limits. On the contrary, delving into these works only sharpened our
critical faculties. Love and study cannot exist without struggle, and
struggle cannot occur solely inside the refuge we call the university.
Being grounded in the world we wish to make is fundamental. As I argued
in Freedom Dreams nearly fifteen years ago, "Social movements generate
new knowledge, new theories, new questions. **[The most [radical
ideas]{.mark} often [grow out of a concrete intellectual engagement with
the problems of aggrieved populations confronting systems of
oppression."]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}Ironically I wrote these
words with my students in mind, many of whom were involved in campus
struggles, feeling a bit rudderless but believing that the only way to
make themselves into authentic activists was to leave the books and
radical theories at home or in their dorms. The undercommons offers
students a valuable model of study that takes for granted the
indivisibility of thought and struggle, not unlike its antecedent, the
Mississippi Freedom Schools.

**Wright 15** -- (2015, Michelle, PhD in Comparative Literature from the
University of Michigan, Professor of African American Studies and
Comparative Literature Studies at Northwestern University, "Physics of
Blackness: Beyond the Middle Passage Epistemology," pp. 147-55, endnote
on p. 188)

When interpellated through the Middle Passage epistemology, Blackness
has a limited set of qualitative values or denotations that link it to
the events in that epistemology such as the commitment to collective and
individual struggle, "racial uplift," and the maintenance of strong
communities through "traditional" or heteropatriarchal family
structures. More **[[generally]{.mark}, the Middle Passage
epistemology]{.underline}** (**[like]{.underline}** other **[established
Black linear progress or antiprogress
narratives]{.underline}**---**[e.g.]{.underline}**, Afrocentrism,
PanAfricanism, Negritude, **[[Afropessimism]{.underline}]{.mark}**)10
also **[[links all Black collectives across the Diaspora to the
experience of racism]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the need to overcome
it---so how can Ramses II be "Black"? Even further, what does it mean
for us to claim him as "Black"? It is hard to interpellate Ramses (or
any of the other African kings, queens, leaders, intellectuals,
politicians, scientists, etc., whose physiognomy we would acknowledge as
stereotypically "Black") within the qualitative definition of Middle
Passage Blackness as making common cause with African Americans---or any
other "Black" community fighting racism and seeking socioeconomic and
political equality in the African Diaspora. In attempting to
interpellate Ramses within this definition,
**[[we]{.underline}]{.mark}** must **[[produce Blackness as a fixed
identity that transcends time and space]{.underline}]{.mark}**; through
this, Ramses no longer belongs to his own spacetime but retroactively
becomes a denigrated "Negro" who must combat his oppression. A paradox
or---as Massey terms it, "a dichotomous result"---now confronts us: was
Ramses II a Black freedom fighter or a ruler of extraordinary and
largely unquestioned power, one of the greatest and most oppressive in
the history of Egyptian pharaohs? **[It is [the]{.mark} qualitative
[definition]{.mark} of Black progress that [creates this dichotomy, a
paradox that then "empties out"]{.mark} all [meaning]{.mark} in
qualitative collapse]{.underline}**. The attempt to interpellate Ramses
II through a Black progress narrative exposes the continuing attempt and
subsequent failure of the progress narrative to interpellate Ramses. He
is Black because he is a Black African, but he is not Black, because
neither "Black" nor "African" operated as identities in Ramses's
spacetime. Ramses II's life speaks to the greatness of African empires,
but his unapologetic use of massive slave labor should "expel" him from
Black progressive membership, the same way in which some discourses
attempt to expel Blacks whose actions deliberately harmed other Blacks.
**[While we should]{.underline}** perhaps **[not lose sleep over the
"odd individual" whose]{.underline}** terrible **[behaviors
bar]{.underline}** him, her, or **[them from]{.underline}** full or
perhaps even partial mention in **[a Black progress
narrative]{.underline}**, there are other Black individuals who are
barred from mention who have not acted against the principle of striving
for collective progress. **[[This]{.mark} dichotomy]{.underline}** also
**[[threatens]{.mark} to create interpellative problems for [Blacks
who]{.mark}]{.underline}**, unlike the Egyptian pharaoh, **[[move across
the Atlantic]{.mark} at the same time as millions of Black Africans are
being sailed to and sold into the Americas]{.underline}**, **[[but not
in the same directions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, veering away from our
progress narrative. **[Black [slaves transported]{.mark} outside of the
Americas [to Europe, India, and elsewhere do not retain a collective
identity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[They]{.underline}]{.mark}** are
sold individually and **[[disappear]{.mark} into
households]{.underline}**, perhaps **[factories, fields]{.underline}**,
or country **[roads and city streets]{.underline}**, intersecting with
populations at large. **[From the point of view of Black
linear]{.underline}** progress **[narratives]{.underline}**, progress
has not been achieved because the collective has evanesced (and is
therefore unable to achieve its goal of overcoming racism), or read
another way, **[their histories have become irrelevant to the collective
historical theme of overcoming racism]{.underline}**. **[Qualitatively
speaking, [it appears difficult if not impossible]{.mark} [to
interpellate Blackness using a Black Atlantic
linear]{.mark}]{.underline}** progress **[[narrative]{.mark} in a
significant and lasting way]{.underline}**. In "The World Is All of One
Piece: The African Diaspora and Transportation to Australia," which is
included in Ruth Simms Hamilton's book Routes of Passage, Cassandra
Pybus reprises a version of Sidney Mintz's question about the
qualitative limits of Black Atlantic studies: **[[A transnational
historical consciousness]{.mark} and a capacity to encompass experience
in disparate time and space [are great strengths of African diaspora
studies]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[In so far as there is a weakness, it
is that the Atlantic world remains the locus of
discussion]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[While some attention has begun to
drift toward the Indian Ocean, less]{.underline}** scholarship **[has
been directed toward the distant Pacific]{.underline}**. . . . In the
diaspora at the detailed penal transportation records we can find
information about the African end of the eighteenth century that is very
hard to come by elsewhere and that points in directions in which
historians may not otherwise look.11 Pybus understands that her topic is
framed by African Diaspora studies yet constrained by its "Atlantic
focus"; she then observes that despite this swirl of scholarly activity
in the Atlantic, there is a "drift" and "direction" toward the Indian
Ocean and the "distant Pacific." This passage draws a connecting line
moving horizontally (well, south by southeast) from the moment of the
American Revolution in the Middle Passage timeline to other moments in
those kingdoms and empires that border the Indian Ocean and, more
specifically, to the moment of the British penal colony of Australia. By
moving us horizontally into the Pacific, Pybus traces the journey of
those (primarily) U.S. Blacks who allied with the defeated British and
accompanied them on their return to England. Once there, the promised
support from the Crown never materialized, and many of these former
soldiers, spies, and support staff found themselves on the London
streets. These (primarily) men would have been in competition with an
already burgeoning class of the dispossessed filling the streets of
London and other industrial centers. As Robert Hughes argues in his
monumental history of the settling of white Australia, The Fatal Shore,
land grabs by the aristocracy and the replacement of cottage industries
with large industrialized factories deprived farmers, laborers, and
urban workers of their former careers as well as prospects for new ones
(many machines, such as looms, required fewer adult workers). Theft,
especially with the poor now rubbing shoulders with the wealthy in
crowded urban centers, skyrocketed, and Parliament responded with deeply
punitive measures; to steal a bit of ribbon or bread could send you to
prison or heavy labor or, most fearful of all, condemn you to
"transport" (to a British penal colony). With the American colonies no
longer available for convicts, Britain turned to its recently neglected
"discovery" of Australia as a convenient replacement, and so white and
Black Britons, along with a few U.S. and Caribbean Blacks, found
themselves transported as part of the First Fleet settlers. Pybus's
second horizontal reading comes, counterintuitively, mostly through
records created by hierarchies such as court, maritime, colonial, and
penal records, due to the paucity of "horizontal" archives
(correspondence between peers, diaries, etc.). Pybus, not unlike Hughes
in The Fatal Shore, constructs a horizontal narrative of these Black
convicts and settlers through (unavoidably) mostly vertical archival
sources: state, judicial, colonial, and penal records that read these
human beings as mere numbers filling ships, accepting punishment, and
perhaps enriching the Crown through forced labor. To an even greater
extent than Hughes, Pybus works to retrieve the very multivalent human
experiences behind these records of discipline and punishment, to see
the interactions denoted, denounced, and pronounced through their eyes,
so to speak, looking out horizontally rather than down from the (at
least figurative) heights of the judge's bench and foreman's lash.
**[[Yet despite]{.underline}]{.mark}** these **[two [horizontal
readings]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[qualitative collapse
looms]{.underline}**]{.mark} here **[[because Pybus has framed]{.mark}
this [history as a horizontal connection to]{.mark} what is ultimately
[a vertical framework that finds meaning in the struggle against
racism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Pybus's Black Founders offers us a
notable exception to our assumptions about Blackness, but in her work,
as in other histories she mentions, Blackness evanesces as the convicts
and settlers perhaps married, procreated, and most certainly died
without moving a coherent Black Atlantic collective forward in its quest
for equality in a majority white society. Or, rather more complicatedly,
in Black Founders Blackness evanesces into either the white Australian
population or the Australian Aboriginal population, in the latter case
an indigenous Blackness. Most likely reflecting on this, Pybus herself
does not think that this discovery of Australia's "Black founders"
radically changes the history of the African Diaspora or Australia: "My
point is not that this cohort of convicts is especially significant to
the history of Australia---though it certainly challenges the
conventional reading of the colonial experience---but to examine what it
can tell us about the wider world."12 If we add Epiphenomenal time to
our Black Atlantic frame, however, we can avoid the qualitative collapse
that (re)produces these histories as interesting in their own right but
marginal to our understanding of Black Atlantic history. Interpellated
through Epiphenomenal time, the Blackness in Black Founders first
changes a person's relationship to Blackness and indigeneity. Rather
than simply "losing" indigenous status once captured and then sold,
Blackness intersects twice more with indigeneity, and on two continents:
North America and Australia. In both cases, indigenous peoples sometimes
helped Black slaves escape, the latter often marrying into specific
American Indian nations. Middle Passage U.S. Blackness now shares a
spacetime through indigeneity and raises questions about Central and
South American intersections (such as the Garifunas of Nicaragua).13 One
might also see a third, more controversial intersection, between U.S.
Blacks who "returned" to establish the free state of Liberia and the
indigenous populations who found themselves oppressed in the resulting
socioeconomic and political hierarchy. The qualitative value of Pybus's
Blackness now meaningfully intersects with the Americas but is not
swallowed by it, because the frame is horizontally comparative rather
than vertically subordinating. The intersection of Blackness with
indigeneity in the Americas, Australia, and Africa also subverts the
notion of a "purely" diasporic Blackness, even within the progress
narrative itself, because the latter honors indigeneity as the "origin"
to which the collective must eventually return. In this moment of
interpellation, origin/home is achieved not necessarily through return
but through intersections with other "first nations" in the Atlantic and
Pacific. Even further, we can see how Blackness, in intersecting with
indigeneity when (formally) seeking "return," as in Liberia, might
produce not egalitarian unity but instead oppressive hierarchy. Black
Founders also provides us with perhaps unheard of dimensions of
Blackness that, once recognized, might usefully connect to other
possible spacetimes that share this dimension. As noted before, the
"Atlantic Blacks" who arrived with the First Fleet and on subsequent
convict ships experienced a range of lives or careers that cannot be
summed up through one collective trajectory, especially that of the
progress narrative. Pybus shows that in our present moment of reading,
Blackness becomes ambiguous in its meaning in these early colonies. On
the one hand, racial designations are clearly marked in the official
records, but unlike in the Americas, socioeconomic and political castes
are not created to wholly segregate them. There are many marriages one
would designate as "interracial," but even if one could access some
understanding of how "interracial marriage" would translate in this
spacetime, marriage is rarely an ideal that denotes the cessation of
difficulties over differences. As more than one wag has pointed out, the
dominance of heterosexual marriage certainly does not reflect an
egalitarian harmony of relations between the sexes. The marriages in
question are thus racialized outside of social racializations, meaning
that to be Black in these colonies does not automatically designate a
subaltern status below that of whites. In cases where Black convicts
were executed or subjected to physical punishment (whipping was the most
common), we might see racially motivated causes, but in the brutal tide
of regular executions and torturous punishment, it is difficult to
extrapolate consistently a narrative in which this Blackness can be
separated from the brutal imperial and capitalist caste system that
ruled all British subjects, including the white working poor. Blacks
intermixing with the white working poor populations in England and
Australia intersect with similar interactions during the earlier
spacetime of indentured servitude in the United States and the later one
of late nineteenth-century Irish immigration to northeastern urban
centers of the United States. If we step back from Pybus's initial
frame, which connects the history of the Black Atlantic in Australia
horizontally, and instead honor the horizontality of her interpellations
of Black individuals and their intersections (through marriage, penal
life, executions, manumission, etc.), one can read this history as a
series of moments that intersect not only with Black Atlantic histories
in the Americas but also with histories in Europe, Africa, and perhaps
India. It should be noted that, while we are discovering intersections
of collectives, we do so wholly within idealist frameworks that can be
further interpellated only through individuals who make up those
collectives; beneficially, however, the collective identities that
intersect with these individuals produce yet more collectives in more
spacetimes---more dimensions of Blackness across the Atlantic, Pacific,
and Indian Oceans. While the era of the Middle Passage produces many and
varied kinds of Blackness through the intersection of linear and
Epiphenomenal time, the conflated eras of World War II and the postwar
era offer yet more. I understand World War II and the postwar period as
a conflation of eras because it is impossible to pinpoint where one ends
and the other begins; however, when we are operating with Epiphenomenal
time, this ambiguity is productive rather than restrictive. Indeed,
breadth, depth, ambiguity, ambivalence, and dominance are the strengths
contributed by these overlapping eras: breadth because World War II
involved almost the majority of Black Africans and Black Diasporans
across the globe, whereas slavery---which forms the cornerstone of the
Middle Passage epistemology---did not; depth because the various
narratives, such as that of Black African men attempting to resist
forcible conscription by French and British colonial forces, or that of
African American men and women who fought for the right to be drafted,
require explanation and further research; ambiguity because we find
Blackness where we do not expect it and struggle to interpret it, such
as Black German individuals who served in Hitler's army and Black
Brazilian troops tasked with defending Italy; ambivalence because it is
a war and its equally destructive aftermath ironically connects the
African Diaspora many times over with ease and diversity; and finally,
dominance because World War II and the postwar era constructed an
interpellative frame that has been used by so many across the globe, a
frame that highlights the contemporary and global importance of
Blackness far more frequently than themes of the Middle Passage ever do.
While the rise of the BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India, and China),
the Arab Spring, and other sociopolitical and economic events seem to
signal the framing of a new era, journalists, pundits, and politicians
alike still interpret many of these events as effects of the World War
II/postwar era. Even the most rigid histories cannot sustain a
completely linear Second World War narrative. For example, the invasion
of Poland in 1939 must be explained by the rise of Nazism, which perhaps
requires a notation about the Versailles Treaty. Likewise, the bombing
of Pearl Harbor is necessary to explain the entrance of the United
States into the war as a direct combatant. The Second World War,
therefore, has at least two beginnings and, even by conservative
estimates, at least two endings: the surrender of the Nazis in Berlin
and the signed surrender by the Japanese on the USS Missouri in Tokyo
Bay. This gives us a war with at least two timelines to which there
correspond two themes, two notions of progress, and many ways in which
occupied nations must be understood: as collaborators, as wholly
oppressed, as underground resisters, and so on. This nonlinear set of
peoples, places, and events forces anyone seeking interpellations
through World War II to accept all the exceptions to its linear progress
narrative---that is, it forces researchers to incorporate great nuance
into their interpellations (in asking when the Second World War ended,
for example, we have to amend the question to reflect all the surrenders
and dates that dominant discourses on World War II cite in response
because, whether there were multiple wars or one great war may be a
matter of definition, but there is no question that there were multiple
narratives that intersected). This means that qualitative collapse will
occur less frequently in interpellations made through a wholly linear
progress narrative on the war (because dominant discourses do not offer,
really, any wholly linear narratives of it), but when it does, the
effect is almost always "deafening," as if it were drowning out
alternative interpellations.14 Blackness can manifest through this
multidimensionality, in most cases quite easily. In contrast to the
difficulty involved in explaining how Blacks from the Atlantic found
themselves in Australia, the global reach of the Second World War makes
it easy to explain how Blackness has spread almost everywhere. When
using both Epiphenomenal and linear spacetimes to interpellate Blackness
in these eras, no long, creative narratives are needed to explain the
presence of West Africans under British rule, East Africans under
Italian Fascist rule, or the fight for equality both at home and abroad
that was the self-appointed task of many an African American man or
woman in uniform; moreover, using both spacetimes enables Black European
studies to explain without much difficulty how Blacks of African descent
came to fight under Hitler. We can arrive at these explanations by
starting with the individual, rather than the collective, as a point of
interpellation. We can then link such an individual to his, her, or
their variously realized collective identities (understanding that we
should never claim that an individual is fully realized, as we can work
within distinct spacetimes only as they are imagined in the now, not in
both the present and the past). Unfortunately, many of these dimensions
as interpellated through the postwar epistemology are easily achieved
through vertical structures: we need only locate (in ascending order) a
military battalion, a regiment, or a division that would contain Black
soldiers and its encampments and headquarters. Vertical readings alone
can often interpellate an agential and diverse Blackness: Black soldiers
and field nurses with agency, Black civilians with choices, and a whole
roster of intersections with a broad variety of peers (soldiers and
civilians) across vast geographies. At first glance, performing vertical
interpellations through linear narratives appears to bear the same fruit
as a horizontal reading: Blackness with agency and diversity. This might
explain why so many Black collective progress narratives of World War II
use this multidimensionality to produce hierarchical, or vertical,
interpellations for the collective. The "Windrush narrative" of Black
Britain, for example, readily narrates the contributions of Black
British Caribbeans in the Second World War, yet uses a progress
narrative to interpellate this Blackness. Like the histories of African
American men who fought for the United States during World War I, the
"Windrush" narrative underscores the painful hypocrisy of serving the
British Crown only to be treated as an undesirable emigrant in the
postwar era.15 Drawing on oral histories of service in the war and
archival records from the British War Office, Windrush: The Irresistible
Rise of Multi-Racial Britain (1999) interpellates Black Britishness as
agential and diverse, a proud component of the history of World War II
but of official British histories of the war more particularly.16 To be
sure, even when operating within World War II/postwar frameworks, we
encounter obstacles. Hierarchies of power are not (unfortunately) wholly
erased, and they can be complicated by the complexities of global
alliances and rivalries (no matter how easily they are manifested in the
postwar epistemology). The postwar epistemology's emphasis on the "now,"
in the absence of a geographical center (a component of even the most
traditional narratives of the Second World War/postwar era),17 allows,
say, Samoan warriors aiding the Allies to be interpellated through
collective identities that certainly include hierarchal structures
(e.g., the military command structure) but also relationships whereby
power must constantly be negotiated (e.g., in relationships between
soldiers or between soldiers and civilians). The "now" complicates
power, meaning that while an Epiphenomenal interpellation enables
agency, it will also reflect those vertical hierarchies that inevitably
accompany so many moments of interpellation in every individual life
across the globe.18 \*\*\*BEGIN ENDNOTE\*\*\* 18. **[[One could

For having the temerity to defend himself, Mr. **[Packer was
accused]{.underline}** on social media **[of \"excusing racism\" and
\"whitesplaining.\" Such logic extends]{.underline}** a disturbing trend
in left-of-center public thinking: **[identity

the line became identity ethics, or morality-through-being.
**[Accordingly, [whiteness and wrongness have become
interchangeable]{.mark} --- the high ground is now accessible only by
way of \"allyship,\" which is to say silence and total
repentance.]{.underline}** The upside to this new white burden, of
course, is that **[whichever way they may choose, those deemed white
remain this nation\'s primary actors. [Given the]{.mark} genuine
[severity of]{.mark} the [Trump]{.mark} threat,
[some]{.mark}]{.underline}** readers of this essay **[[may wonder, why
devote energy to picking over the virtue]{.mark} and solidarity
signaling [of the left? Quite simply because getting this kind of
thinking wrong exacerbates the very inequality it seeks to
counteract.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In the most memorable sentence in
\"The First White President,\" Mr. Coates declares, \"Whereas his
forebears carried whiteness like an ancestral talisman, Trump cracked
the glowing amulet open, releasing its eldritch energies.\" I have spent
the past six months poring over the literature of European and American
white nationalism, in the process interviewing noxious identitarians
like the alt-right founder Richard Spencer. The most shocking aspect of
Mr. **[[Coates\'s wording]{.underline}]{.mark}** here is the extent to
which it **[[mirrors ideas of race --- specifically the specialness of
whiteness --- that white supremacist thinkers cherish.]{.mark}
This]{.underline}**, more than anything, **[is what is so unsettling
about]{.underline}** Mr. Coates\'s recent writing and **[the tenor of
the leftist \"woke\" discourse]{.underline}** he epitomizes. Though it
is not at all morally equivalent, **[it is nonetheless in sync with the
toxic premises of white supremacism.]{.underline}** **[[Both
sides]{.mark} eagerly [reduce people to abstract color
categories,]{.mark} all the [while feeding off of and legitimizing each
other, while those of us searching for]{.mark} gray areas and [common

interpreting it as something fixed,]{.mark} determinative and almost
supernatural. For]{.underline}** Mr. **[Coates, whiteness]{.underline}**
is a \"talisman,\" an \"amulet\" of \"eldritch energies\" that
**[explains all injustice]{.underline}**; for the abysmal early-
20th-century Italian fascist and racist icon Julius Evola, it was **[a
\"meta- biological force,\" a collective mind-spirit that justifies all
inequality.]{.underline}** In either case, whites are preordained to
walk that special path. **[[It is a dangerous vision]{.mark} of life [we
should refuse no matter who is doing the
conjuring]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This summer, I spent an hour on the
phone with Richard Spencer. It was an exchange that left me feeling
physically sickened. Toward the end of the interview, he said one thing
that I still think about often. He referred to the all-encompassing
sense of white power so many liberals now also attribute to whiteness as
a profound opportunity. \"This is the photographic negative of a white
supremacist,\" he told me gleefully. \"This is why I\'m actually very
confident, because maybe those leftists will be the easiest ones to
flip. However far-fetched that may sound, what identitarians like Mr.
Spencer have grasped, and what ostensibly anti-racist thinkers like Mr.
Coates have lost sight of, is **[the fact that [so long as we fetishize
race, we ensure]{.mark} that [we will never be rid of the hierarchies it

at which we stand but also by an awareness of our long history of
resistance as a people, because in our collective strivings and social
struggles we seek a new future]{.underline}** for our people, our
descendants, and the world. Joined also to these conditions and
considerations is the compelling character of our self-understanding as
a people, as a moral vanguard in this country and the world. For **[we
have launched, fought, and won with our allies [struggles]{.mark} that
not only [have expanded the realm of freedom]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
this country and the world but also have **[served as [an]{.mark}
ongoing [inspiration and]{.mark} a [model of liberation]{.mark}
struggles [for other]{.mark} marginalized and [oppressed peoples]{.mark}
and groups]{.underline}** throughout the world. Indeed, they have
borrowed from and built on our moral vocabulary and moral vision, sung
our songs of freedom, and held up our struggle for liberation as a model
to emulate. Now, **[self-understanding and self-assertion are
dialectically linked]{.underline}**. In other words, **[how we
understand ourselves in the world determines how we assert ourselves in
the world]{.underline}**. Thus, **[an expansive concept of ourselves as
Africans-continental and diasporan-and as Africana philosophers forms an
essential component of our sense of mission and the
urgency]{.underline}** with which we approach it. It is important to
note that I have conceived and written this chapter within the framework
of Kausaida philosophy (Karenga 1978, 1980, 1997)
**[Kawaida]{.underline}** is a philosophic initiative that **[was forged
in the crucible of ideological and practical struggles around issues of
freedom, justice, equalitys, self-determination, conullunal power,
self-defense, pan\~African- ism, coalition and alliance, Black Studies,
intellectual emancipation, and cultural recovery and
reconstlouction]{.underline}**. It continued to develop in the midst of
these ongoing struggies within the life of the mind and stmggles iottbtn
the life of the people, as well as within the context of the conditions
of the world. Kawaida is defined as an ongoing synthesis of the best of
xAfrican thought and practice in constant exchange tuttb tl3e \'U)()ltd.
**[It characterizes culture as a unique, instructive and valuable way of
being human in the world-as a foundation and framework for
self-understanding and self-assertion]{.underline}**. As a philosophy of
culture and struggle, Kawaida maintains that **[[our intellectual and
social practice]{.underline}]{.mark}** as Nricana activist scholars
**[[must]{.underline}]{.mark}** be undergirded and informed by ongoing
efforts to (1) ground our- selves in our own culture; (2) **[[constantly

of [what it means to be African and human in the fullest

the world and (4) use our culture to constantly make our own unique

### \--at: it's bad

#### Radical rejection of the humanist subject is an endless repetition that goes nowhere

**[This is a [politics of negativity]{.mark} [devoid of any
clear]{.mark} political or ethical [vision]{.mark}: it [wants to
destroy]{.mark} what exists [without giving us]{.mark} much of [a sense
of what should exist]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It may of course be that
offering an alternative politico-ethical vision is more or less
impossible. Perhaps it is not the task of theory to define the future
but merely to critique the present. In principle, I do not have a
problem with the idea that the purpose of theory is to show us what is
wrong rather than to tell us what to do. At the same time, I am more
inclined to look for \"real-life\" referents for my theoretical
paradigms than those who believe that theory is---or should be---an
imaginative activity wholly divorced from the exigencies of lived
reality. On the one hand, the latter attitude is freeing in the sense
that suddenly anything is possible, including the idea that stupidity
represents a radical politico-ethical project. **[But on the other, [it
can lead to]{.mark} what Lacan calls [\"empty\" speech]{.mark}, speech
[devoid of]{.mark} any [meaning]{.mark}]{.underline}** (pure rhetoric).
It is from this partly unconvinced perspective that I would like to
start putting pressure on three interrelated tendencies within recent
queer theory. I will return to each of these tendencies in greater
detail in later chapters. Here let me merely name them briefly. First, I
do not think that the celebration of negativity for its own sake that
characterizes some versions of queer theory amounts to much (besides
explosive rhetoric). I prefer to work with negativity, to see what
negativity can do for us. In the next two chapters, I will try to
illustrate that this is what Lacan sought to do, despite Edelman\'s
efforts to tell us otherwise. Second, I think that the
semiautomatic---and therefore no longer honestly critical---**[[attempt
to annihilate \"the subject\"]{.mark} that runs through much of
progressive theory, including queer theory, [is a theoretical]{.mark}
and politico-ethical [dead end]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Though I
understand the historical reasons for the assault on the humanist
subject, I wonder about the almost ritualistic manner in which the
slaughter of \"the subject\" gets undertaken from text to
text]{.underline}**, as if thinkers such as Lacan, Derrida, Foucault,
and Deleuze somehow botched the job back in the 1960s and 1970s. It
seems to me that **[this [all-too-predictable battering]{.mark} of the
subject [represents a theoretical repetition]{.mark} compulsion [in
the]{.mark} strictly [Freudian sense]{.mark}, [indicating]{.mark}, among
other things, a [traumatic fixation that keeps us from moving to]{.mark}
new conceptual terrains, including the question of [what it might mean
to be a subject after the collapse of]{.mark} the unified, arrogant, and
self-mastering subject of [humanist metaphysics]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Of all the recurring themes of queer theory, the **[[assault on the
subject]{.mark} is what, for me, gives the strongest impression of empty
speech, for it [seems to have]{.mark} virtually [nothing to do
with]{.mark} the [personal realities of those who advocate it]{.mark},
most of whom live semicoherent, semicontinous lives in semiconsistent
(usually tenured) lifeworlds.]{.underline}**

**[My goal in these reflections is to assess the characteristic
arguments of scholars associated under the sign of
''[Afro-Pessimism]{.mark}.'']{.underline}** **[They are typically
identified as]{.underline}** Saidiya **[Hartman]{.underline}**, Frank
**[Wilderson, and]{.underline}** Jared **[Sexton]{.underline}**. In my
view, **[this work [tells]{.mark} an]{.underline}**
**[essential]{.underline}**, dark **[[truth]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[about race and Euro-Atlantic modernity, but [by a problematic
form]{.mark} of argument [and affect]{.mark}; the work is a
profound]{.underline}** **[explanation]{.underline}** **[of our current
racial impasse but in]{.underline}** **[troubling ways]{.underline}**
**[it also is a]{.underline}** **[symptom]{.underline}** **[of that
impasse and risks]{.underline}** **[reifying it]{.underline}**. To
explore these ambiguities, I will situate this work in several
contexts.6 The first, obvious, context is the canon of Black political
thought and literature. Using the idea of ''problem-space'' I take from
David Scott (2004) and the idea of ''argumentative tradition'' I take
from Alisdair MacIntyre (1977), I would ask: what constitutive questions
(and answers) do these thinkers inherit, but also revise? First, by what
concepts and narratives do we understand and represent our condition?
(We thus contrast arguments about slavery and its after-life, race and
race-making, as well as white supremacy, anti-blackness, ''social
death,'' and ''political ontology.'') A second question concerns
political subjectivity: how should a racially marked people conceive the
''we'' shape themselves into a collective political subject? (Are we a
''minority'' needing allies to democratize the civic identity \[and
civil society\] of a nation professing universalism, a ''nation'' based
in ethnicity or common interest, a ''colony'' seeking transnational
affiliations against empire?) Relatedly, third, how do we understand
(say diagnose) those who constitute themselves as white? (Answers to
this question signal if or how their identity, conduct, and norms of
citizenship can be changed decisively.) Implicit in these is a fourth
question: how do we narrate the relation between present and past, to
dramatize the after-life of slavery and what is damaging and valuable in
a legacy of domination and struggle? Hartman thus asks Nietzsche's
question: ''what is the story about the slave we ought to tell out of
the present we ourselves inhabit?'' (Hartman and Best, 2005) That story
must also judge if, as Hannah Arendt argued, the concepts we inherit
can(not) illuminate what is novel or unprecedented in our circumstances.
Because I situate ''Afro-pessimism'' in the argumentative tradition of
black political thought, I will foreground Sexton's and Wilderson's view
that modern/ western/liberal (Euro-Atlantic) society is founded on a
''political ontology'' of ''anti-blackness,'' by which the ''social
death'' of those racially marked as ''nonbeings'' is the condition of
human being and life for others. By making antiblackness and social
death foundational to liberal modernity, Afro-Pessimist work depicts the
persistence of gross inequality, segregation, and gratuitous violence as
the undying ''after-life'' of slavery, which liberal society never
consigned to the past. As this argument explains the failures of civil
rights reform and narratives of progress, though, a second obvious
context becomes visible: **[Afro-Pessimism is not only a]{.underline}**
**[theory]{.underline}** **[to juxtapose to a canon of theories, but
a]{.underline}** **[speech-act]{.underline}** **[that bespeaks the
impasse it would address and enter. It intervenes intentionally in a
problem-space of questions and answers, but is also symptomatic of the
context it claims to explain. Its rhetoric manifests what Raymond
Williams called a structure of feeling, whose character and impact
requires interpretation]{.underline}**. On the one hand, I am inclined
to say of Afro-Pessimism what Adorno said of psychoanalysis -- only its
exaggerations are true -- because otherwise we readily disavow a truth
about our history and circumstances that is hard to acknowledge let
alone bear. **[Theorizing -- bearing witness to -- ''structural
positionality'' is crucial to explaining persisting racial domination.
But on the other hand, their rhetoric is a symptom of impasse. The work
of Sexton and Wilderson, in particular, sustains the critical, systemic,
and internationalist frame of Fanon and American advocates of black
power, but it lacks their animating sense of possibility. It sustains
the black radical tradition by identifying what is]{.underline}**
**[distinctive]{.underline}** **[in black positionality in liberal
modernity, but in the way it claims exceptionality]{.underline}** **[in
relation to other forms of oppression, Afro-Pessimism also enacts
a]{.underline}** **[defensive status politics]{.underline}**. In turn,
this articulation of blackness in terms of death and life suggest a
third context, at once theological and psychoanalytical. First Context:
Black Political Thought and Intractability Afro-Pessimists draw their
central -- both diagnostic and generative -- claim from Orlando
Patterson (1982): slavery is distinguished not by intensified
exploitation of labor, but by a ''social death'' he defines as natal
alienation, generalized dishonor, and violent domination. Modernity
emerges in the equation of slavery as social death with blackness,
whereby only those marked as black are consigned to these conditions.
Hartman has condensed and updated the idea of social death by the
concept of ''fungibility,'' to denote how slavery has an after-life
because blacks do not become human subjects, but remain objects of
(material, accumulative, sexual, symbolic) use, including subjection to
gratuitous violence and disposability (Patterson, 1982). At the same
time, the production of this social death for those marked black is the
disavowed condition of possibility for the economy and culture of those
defining themselves as human, or non-black. As Hartman (1997, 2003)
showed in Scenes of Subjection and interviews, even though chattel
slavery was officially ended, a racializing regime instantiating
devaluation has remained foundational to the material life and symbolic
order of liberal civil society. These arguments thus explain -- and make
meaningful -- the intractability of racialized inequality and violence
despite the purported displacement of overt white supremacy by civil
rights and multi-culturalism. Wilderson and Sexton, building on Fanon
and Hartman, thus argue that ''Blackness'' denotes a position not an
identity. Wilderson says, ''Afro-pessimists are theorists of black
positionality who share Fanon's insistence that, though Blacks
are...sentient beings, the structure of the entire world's semantic
field...is sutured by anti-black solidarity...Afro-pessimism explores
the meaning of Blackness not -- in the first instance -- as a variously
interpellated identity or conscious social actor, but as a structural
position of non-communicability in the face of all other positions.'' A
position of ''absolute dereliction'' marks the non-being that cannot
signify but can be made to signify, as well as accumulated, exploited,
killed (Wilderson, 2010, pp. 58--59). In Wilderson's narrative, then,
''modernity marks the emergence of a new ontology because it is an era
in which an entire race appears, people who, prior to any transgressive
act or losing a war, stand as socially dead in relation to the rest of
the world'' (Wilderson, 2010, p. 18). Modern liberal ''civil society is
held together by a structural prohibition against recognizing and
incorporating a being that is dead, despite the fact that this being is
sentient and appears very much alive.'' Civil society, wage relations,
and constitutionalism among rights-bearing subjects are underwritten by
generalized dishonor and violent domination of those marked black, but
also by ''a libidinal economy of enjoyment,'' because ''fantasies of
murderous hatred and unlimited destruction, of sexual consumption and
social availability animate'' such violence and ''the psychic life of
culture as well'' (Wilderson, 2010, p. 27). Jared Sexton (2008, 2016)
calls Afro-pessimism a ''critique'' of ''political ontology,'' but why
use this locution? The middle passage inaugurated a ''condition of
ontology and not just an event of experience'' because chattel slavery
founded (conditions of) non-being and being (Wilderson, 2010, p. 14). If
ontology is the study of how we define the general conditions of
possibility for human being, then political ontology denotes how
politics founds what Fred Moten calls ''the nonrelationality that
structures all relationality,'' the denial of being that structures
symbolic order and material reality in modernity (Moten, 2013).
''Anti-blackness'' is ''ontological'' as an unthought, foundational (and
so intractable) condition framing human being, but ''political'' because
conventional, historical, potentially changeable. In turn, to theorize
''structural positionality'' ''is to be Afro-Pessimist, not
Afrocentric,'' because ''blackness'' denotes a condition (of non-being)
to refuse, and neither a (prior, African) identity to retrieve, nor a
''cultural identity'' to assert (Wilderson, 2010, p. 58). Wilderson thus
posits ''the inaugural difference'' that instituted the modern and its
defining ''genre of the human'' as Sylvia Wynter (2003) puts it. Marxian
and Lacanian structuralism also originate human society and culture in
the structure of (class or gender) positions into which people are
interpellated. But Wilderson depicts ''gender or economic oppression''
as ''contingent riders'' limiting ''the freedom of human subjects'';
''exploited humans in conflict with unexploited humans,'' or women
dominated by men, remain within human being, not set off ontologically
from it. He insists on this ''unbridgeable gap'' between the ''suffering
dynamics of the ontologically alive,'' and black positionality. ''Deep
within civil society's collective unconscious is the knowledge that the
black position is indeed a position, not an identity, and...inextricably
bound to the constituent elements of social death.'' By this categorical
difference ''gratuitous violence'' and ''exchange'' can ''mark everyone
experientially'' but ''mark blacks ontologically'' (Wilderson, 2003).
This structuralism parallels Althusser and Lacan, but it posits black
positionality as exceptional, both in its equation with non-being, and
as the inaugurating foundation of modernity. In turn, Sexton draws two
implications. ''Whatever else there may be in black culture or cultures
-- in the most capacious, differentiated, global sense -- a narrative of
antagonism is inscribed there, powerfully and profoundly. To ''inhabit''
the ''destruction'' mandated by an ''anti-black world that shapes and
structures every aspect of black existence'' is to face the challenge of
''how to stay within the anxiety of antagonism...to be guided by it, and
again, even to will it?'' (Sexton, 2016, p. 4). As if to disarm any
reduction of militancy to masculinism, Sexton quotes the martial
language of Hortense Spillers: ''My anxiety was finding a way to
actually be in battle...to go to war.'' He credits black feminism with
linking ''rage to hope'' and forging ''a non-compliant but nonviolent
alloy'' to oppose what Spillers calls ''long centuries of unregulated
violence'' (Spillers et al., 2007; Sexton, 2016, pp. 9--10). But he
asks: ''is there such a thing as black feminist violence?'' Not ''to
elevate violence to the level of principle,'' he avers, but ''to include
it as one tactic among others'' in a structure of antagonism. As if to
disarm critics he quotes Spillers again: ''the day that the enslaved
decides to act out the threat of death that hangs over her, by risking
her life, is the first day of wisdom. And whether or not one survives is
perhaps less important than the recognition that, unless one is free,
love cannot and will not matter'' (Spillers et al., 2007; Sexton, 2016,
p. 10). In this passage, we hear Antigone and Audre Lorde, who would
risk their own lives but not another's life, but also Frederick
Douglass' Nietzschean violence as well as Huey Newton's ''revolutionary
suicide,'' when risking life and taking life entwine. If Sexton's first
conclusion moves from political ontology to inescapable antagonism and
so to a Fanonian view of violence as a condition of freedom, his second
conclusion returns to the premise shared with Wilderson, who says,
''black freedom is an ontological'' not ''experiential'' issue. ''Black
freedom'' is not repeated action to contest or interrupt social death,
or fugitive forms of slipping the yoke, but ''an event of epic and
revolutionary proportions'' that is ''the end of both blackness and
humanness,'' the ''emergence of new ontological relations'' (Wilderson,
2010, p. 27). Critics object that arguments about social death deny both
the ''agency'' of blacks and the ''hope'' political resistance requires
(Brown, 2009). Sexton denies any ''rejection of the notion of agency in
advance,'' but instead depicts an ''endeavor to think rigorously about
its conditions of possibility.'' Likewise, theory must face the position
of the ''ex-slave without recourse to the consolations of
transcendence.'' Rather than ''blaming pessimism,'' he quotes Joshua Foa
Dienstag to say, ''perhaps we can learn from it. Rather than hiding from
the ugliness of the world, perhaps we can discover how best to withstand
it.'' Depicting the false solace sought by those who cannot abide the
twinned truths of destruction and antagonism, Sexton (2016) enacts a
pointedly dismissive ''intramural'' critique of Black political thought.
Speaking in the mode of realism to advance the ''pessimistic'' claim
that the modern world is organized to negate and annihilate black
agency, he practices a kind of radical negativity. Does this view blind
us to or even foreclose the ''life'' of black agency in conditions of
social death, or, does it stipulate what would count as fundamental
change? Does this view preclude hope for a different future, or,
stipulate its threshold, to open a possibility we cannot know or depict
in advance? Here is theory as speech-act, my second context, but also,
his idiom of false solace or real transcendence signals my third
context, political theology. Second Context: From Theory to Speech-Act
Gayle Rubin (1975) once joined Engels and Levi-Strauss to theorize what
Sexton calls the ''structural positionality'' of women in patriarchy,
whereby the exchange of women (as quasi-human objects) became the
condition of ''human'' life and culture, and by using Freud and Lacan to
theorize the ''libidinal economy'' tied to this exchange, she depicted
how those marked as women internalized and reproduced their position.
But feminism, she argued, sought a ''radical'' reimagination of
patriarchal kinship conceived as a conventional not natural condition of
human being. It must be said that Rubin herself, and feminism more
broadly, did not theorize the differences slavery instituted. It took
Hortense Spillers to show how the modern form of gender was produced by
white supremacy, as enslaved women were denied the status of gender as a
form of being, and reduced to mere ''flesh.'' The modern sex-gender
system, and its feminist critics, rested on disavowal (or unthinking
presumption) of this prior denial of being (Spillers, 1987; Broeck,
2008). If this insight vindicates the structuralist ambition of ''Afro-
Pessimist'' argument, however, the animating sense of possibility that
living insurgency imparted to the structuralism of radical feminist
theorizing remains absent. Its avowed ''pessimism'' is partly a symptom
of our own moment of impasse, but it also minimizes the current forms of
insurgency surrounding it, and in these regards it performs a black
radicalism that can seem defensive, even bullying, and ''academic'' in
its distance from insurgent politics. At issue for me, then, is not the
idea of a structural positionality that is both foundational and
distinctive, but the motives and idioms that give it a troubling form
and affect. Wilderson and Sexton rightly claim that neither legal
enfranchisement nor material assets secure immunity from vulnerability
as a fungible object; they rightly see the depth and scope of the change
needed to achieve equality. But they posit a categorical and absolute
(not historical or contingent) difference: between ex-slaves, as
non-human beings subject to gratuitous violence; indigenous people, as
''almost-human'' subjects, who retain forms of sovereignty; and white
women and workers ''whose humanity is a given.'' They do not depict the
mutual imbrication of race, class, and gender, the braiding of native
dispossession and slavery, the ratio of violence or fungibility in other
forms of domination, or how political economy and culture is
underwritten, especially, by women positioned as objects of available
for use (and violence.) They refuse what Wilderson calls ''the ruse of
analogy,'' whereby accounts of domination as being (like) slavery deny a
categorical difference in ''ontological'' positionality (Wilderson,
2010). A ''political ontology of race'' is thus tailored to address
post-civil rights fragmentation in the black world, post-1965
immigration and neoliberal multiculturalism, as well as multiplying
varieties of oppression. Partly, Afro-Pessimism uses abundant evidence
of fungibility and violence to posit and defend black commonality
against forms of upward mobility it credibly casts as a deceptive
appearance, but it also ignores or devalues the reality of appearances,
that is, the real complexity of a black world increasingly
differentiated and divided. Likewise, Afro-Pessimism correctly situates
recent versions of ethnic pluralism and class/gender radicalism within
an unchanged black/white racial grid, to credibly mark how
coalition/reform politics continue to evade the distinctive grip of
antiblackness. But **[[rather than highlighting]{.mark} the intractable
grip of [antiblack specificity amid multi-dimensional]{.mark}
intersectional[ity]{.mark}, and rather than [tracing how
antiblackness]{.mark} has]{.underline}** [**[entwined]{.underline}**
**[with]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[settler [colonialism, patriarchy, and
capitalism, Sexton and Wilderson]{.mark} depict black
exceptionality]{.underline}**.7 Understandably
**[[foregrounding]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[how [analogy]{.mark} is
typically used to]{.underline}** (trade on but) **[evade what is
distinctive in racial domination, they [seem unable to admit]{.mark} let
alone credit [complexities and confusions]{.mark} in the gray zone of
intersectionality. As a result, they create a black radicalism that
categorically separates not only itself]{.underline}** **[from other
constituencies, but also the]{.underline}** **[truly
revolutionary]{.underline}** **[from the mere]{.underline}**
**[''consolation'']{.underline}** **[of other forms of organized black
insurgency]{.underline}**. These versions of what I am calling
exceptionality suggest my third context, because, **[in its very
critiques of false transcendence, Afro-Pessimism repeats the idioms of
political theology]{.underline}**. Third Context: From Political
Theology to Psychoanalysis Sexton and Wilderson seem to mean political
ontology as a philosophical/political alternative to political theology.
Like Marx they criticize other-worldly forms of redemption for the sake
of ''soberly'' facing our ''true conditions''; like Marx on class, they
depict blackness as a non-cultural positionality, not an identity; and
like Marx, they project the necessity for, but do not depict, a world
beyond this one. They also echo the revolutionary paradigm of Fanon,
which depicts consignment to non-being, narrates polarized antagonism,
and without substantializing blackness, seeks an epochal movement from
social death to life. Surely, then, the emphasis on positionality,
antagonism, and eschatology evokes Carl Schmitt's ''political theology''
as well as his ''concept of the political.'' For if American liberal
nationalism is constituted by the sovereign violence that establishes
social death for some as the condition of (access to) life for others,
then those positioned as Black are thrown across a theological frontier
that differentiates the damned to produce the saved. Those marked by
non-being are thus called to ''decision,'' to take exception to social
death as a state of exception. Even if Wilderson and Sexton invoke
insurrection but not resurrection, can they escape entanglement in
political theology? At the same time, we should recall Nietzsche's
''analysis'' of the grip of the ascetic ideal among those -- especially
democrats, **[abolitionists]{.underline}**, and atheist leftists -- who
renounced literal theism and other-worldly forms of redemption. For they
sustain ''faith in truth'' and in its name [**[devalue]{.underline}**
**[plurality]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[, perspective, [and
contingency]{.mark}, as well as the unavoidably constitutive impact of
the drives and fantasies that motivate our thought and
action.]{.underline}** Interpreting our will to truth as itself a
motivated faith and perspective on life, Nietzsche makes faith
ubiquitous by placing an act of faith beneath every perspective or
optic. He then weighs the ''value'' of contrasting faiths in terms of
their motivation on one side and their worldly consequences on the other
side. In this way, he discovered the rancor driving his own faith in
critical negativity, and he thus fashioned a ''gay science'' to mitigate
it. How might his model of a counter-political theology help us
interpret and engage a theory focused on the grim truth of social death?
**[Because modernity premises life for some on consigning others to
social death]{.underline}**, Hartman claims, **[deliverance is the
master trope of Black culture. But]{.underline}** **[how to seek life
against death]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}**
**[contestable]{.underline}**. **[Wilderson and Sexton depict the
unbearable truth of social death and unremitting
antagonism]{.underline}** **[between master and slave, in contrast to
which they depict our seduction by (our wish for) narrative and the
redemption]{.underline}** **[it offers.]{.underline}** They speak not to
whites, whose narrative of modernity, nationhood, and progress is
premised on black non-being, but ''intramurally'' to those marked as
black, who are drawn to narratives that promise to overcome white
innocence (in Baldwin's sense) by civic integration, or that promise the
redemption of black suffering by de-colonization, nation-building, or
fugitive creativity. **[Against seduction by narrative, Afro-pessimist
structuralism is presented as the essential and all-controlling truth of
black experience; it gives off the scent of the ascetic ideal not only
because it disavows its own fictionality]{.underline}** **[as
an]{.underline}** optic, genre, or **[organizing fantasy, but also
because of its categorical]{.underline}** juxtaposition of friend and
enemy, its heroized but abstract radicalism, and its
**[dismissal]{.underline}** **[of any other position as a]{.underline}**
**[demeaned form of solace]{.underline}**. **[Especially if we credit
the truth to which Afro-Pessimism bears witness, including the
likelihood of white resistance to or disavowal of its validity, we may
well feel pressured to assent]{.underline}** to it. **[We are pressed by
the form]{.underline}** or logic **[of the argument, which signifies any
doubt or question as objectionable whiteness or pathetic black
acquiescence.]{.underline}** As a white man trying to make this
argument, I am struggling to articulate both its crucial truth, and my
sense, politically and theoretically, that it should be presented or
inflected otherwise, with different affective tonality and political
bearing. For on the one hand, it seems to me that **[''social death'' is
totalized as the truth that must be faced without consolation, while on
the other hand, the only valid response is depicted as revolutionary
(perhaps violent) refusal. We are driven toward]{.underline}**
**[helplessness and despair]{.underline}** **[by an annihilating
structure]{.underline}** **[that seems impossible to change, but also,
if we ask, what can be done, we receive images of revolutionary
suicide]{.underline}**. **[The systematic character of critique offers
a]{.underline}** **[[clarity]{.mark} that [is appealing; we]{.mark} also
[may be tempted by the appearance]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[of heroic
radicalism]{.underline}**]{.mark} -- **[and by an unavowed solace we may
derive from the form of ''election'']{.underline}** **[it offers.
[But]{.mark} we [may be better served]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[by]{.underline}** **[questioning]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the
[either-or]{.mark} structure of [exceptionality]{.mark}, which
juxtaposes social death in/as the ordinary to metaphors of radical
refusal]{.underline}**. By that structure, Schmitt distinguished
ordinary existence as deadening repetition, and miracle as the decision
to take exception to it; **[for Wilderson and Sexton
''life'']{.underline}** thus **[seems to require the]{.underline}**
decisive, **[unequivocal ''event'']{.underline}** **[of overcoming
an]{.underline}** **[ordinary]{.underline}** **[life
ruled]{.underline}** -- indeed emptied out, negated, or literally killed
-- **[by]{.underline}** inescapably gripping **[social death.
But]{.underline}** **[what kind of life or politics is
this?]{.underline}** **[[Might the ''fact'']{.underline}]{.mark}** or
**[''lived experience'' [of blackness as social death be]{.mark}
metabolized, transfigured, [resisted]{.mark}, or dramatized
[in]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[other ways?]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[Rather than]{.underline}** **[radically juxtapose]{.underline}**
**[awful truth and demeaned consolation, could we rework the
relationship of critique and repair?]{.underline}** **[Or is the
impossibility of repair in its usual senses -- because only a revolution
would be truly reparative -- the necessary assumption]{.underline}**
**[for rightly seeing the conditions of black agency?]{.underline}**
Rather than respond to their critique by asking, what radical action
could possibly suffice to change this world, **[could we ask instead,
what is]{.underline}** **[already being done?]{.underline}**8 **[[If we
grasp the]{.mark} truth]{.underline}** **[signified by a [''political
ontology]{.mark} of anti-blackness[,'' we]{.mark} should and [will doubt
the sufficiency]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[of]{.mark} civil rights and
[coalition politics, but]{.mark} couldn't we
[still]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[value
rhizomatic]{.underline}**]{.mark} practices of **[[protest, prosaic
efforts at legal redress]{.mark} or self-defense,
[local]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[experiments]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[in counter-sovereignty, forms of [black nationalism, or]{.mark}
diasporic [cultural politics]{.mark} that poeticize black
creativity?]{.underline}** **[These are ongoing]{.underline}** all
**[around us, but virtually]{.underline}** **[unremarked]{.underline}**
**[by Wilderson or Sexton, who focus on the unbearable truth disavowed
by most whites, and whose radical implications are evaded by many
blacks. But we]{.underline}** **[should not demonize this focus as
simply a fault, either]{.underline}**.9 In addition, if I focus on the
''lived truth'' (the affective bearing and prosaic meaning, not the
referential accuracy) of Afro-Pessimism as an organizing optic, I recall
how Nietzsche focused on the rancor we must feel over our inability to
will backward, and by focusing on our resentment, he foregrounded our
affective orientation toward our suffering and its injustice. In this
spirit, in turn, Eve Sedgwick (2003, 2007) used Melanie Klein's contrast
of paranoid and reparative positions to ''analyze'' the ''hermeneutic of
suspicion'' in critical and queer theorizing, in ways that may help us
creatively engage Afro-pessimism. On the one hand,
**[anti-blackness]{.underline}** and homophobia
**[manifest]{.underline}** **[paranoid splitting, as desire and
aggression]{.underline}** -- what Phillip Roth tellingly calls ''human
stain'' -- **[are]{.underline}** **[projected into
objects]{.underline}** rather than acknowledged. Through what Eric Lott
called ''love and theft'' (unintentionally echoing Klein's ''envy and
gratitude'' toward the mother), **[the enfranchised and normal enact
a]{.underline}** **[paranoid structure]{.underline}** **[that
produces]{.underline}** **[demonized objects]{.underline}** **[but that
also]{.underline}** loves -- and so **[cannibalizes]{.underline}**-
**[what it repudiates]{.underline}**. On the other hand, Sedgwick
argued, queer theory itself inhabits a ''paranoid position'' by a
systemic explanation that ''anticipates'' injury and humiliation,
precludes surprise, polarizes friend and enemy, and denies value to
reparative action. **[Might theoretical and political practice
repair]{.underline}** **[rather than]{.underline}**
**[repeat]{.underline}** **[the]{.underline}** **[aggressive
splitting]{.underline}**, disavowal, and longing for innocence (or
purity) **[that characterizes the object of critique?]{.underline}**
**[In regard to white supremacy, can we devise]{.underline}** what New
Lefties called **[prefigurative practices, to anticipate and embody in
our means the revolutionary ends we posit?]{.underline}** Of course,
Sedgwick is often read in a ''paranoid'' way, as if she posed an
either-or between the paranoid and reparative positions, partly because
at moments she herself does this splitting. But **[[a]{.mark} truly
[''reparative'' view]{.mark} of paranoid theory or radical politics
[would]{.mark}]{.underline}** have to [**[value and
sustain]{.underline}** **[ambivalence]{.underline}**,
**[a]{.underline}** **[tension]{.underline}**
**[between]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the hermeneutic of
suspicion]{.underline}** and quest for deep truth **[that characterizes
''[critique]{.mark},'' [and]{.mark} a generosity that seeks and
welcomes]{.underline}** **[[possibility, in]{.mark} the form of
[unexpected change]{.mark}s, [action]{.mark}s,
[attunement]{.mark}s]{.underline}**. **[If anti-blackness is a paranoid
onto-theology in Klein's sense, what would a reparative alternative feel
like and do?]{.underline}** Like Lacan's psychoanalytic theory,
Wilderson and Sexton place blackness in the position of the unconscious
-- and in the position of maternity. Under the bar, these signify
abjection, excess, and nonsense, the threatening non-being against which
subjectivity, rationality, and the human is defined in phobic, violent
ways. But they do not affirm let alone explore the life made by people
positioned ''in the hold,'' under the bar -- and because they are
positioned there. No more than Lacan on maternity do they substantialize
blackness as a heritage to retrieve or an identity to make and assert.
But **[[critical negativity]{.mark}, focused on social death and
[invested in]{.mark} the [paradoxical purity]{.mark} of asceticism,
[risks becoming death-like]{.mark}]{.underline}**; moreover, **[radical
politics fails]{.underline}** **[unless it bears witness
to]{.underline}** **[life against death]{.underline}**. What this might
mean once appeared in feminist theories that risked exploring the
ubiquitous but disavowed meanings of maternity, whether as the creative
genius of the ''semiotic'' juxtaposed to the symbolic, or as an ethic of
care contrasted with Kantian autonomy. **[In that feminist spirit,
Spillers]{.underline}** in fact **[discerned opportunity hidden in
conditions of social death]{.underline}**: **[because enslaved women
were reduced to ''flesh'']{.underline}** and denied the status of
gender, she argued, **[their children inherit the chance to do gender
and kinship otherwise]{.underline}** (Spillers, 1987). In the essay
Sexton quotes, she also says: ''**[Men of the black diaspora are the
only men who had the opportunity to understand something about the
female \[and vice versa\] that no other community''
could]{.underline}**. Indeed, ''I used to think that black culture was
on the verge of creating...a kind of democratic form...in relationship
to being human. That people did whatever work was to be done, whether
'men's work' or 'women's work''' (Spillers et al., 2007). Spillers never
makes an ethnic claim about blackness, but **[she does show catastrophe
and positionality conferring ''intramural'' gifts]{.underline}**, as
well as an art and politics that disturb what Jacques Rancie\`re calls
the partition of the sensible. In turn, Fred **[Moten uses her feminism
to create an exemplary agon with Afro- Pessimism]{.underline}**. On the
one hand, **[he endorses its fealty to Fanon's basic insight: ''he fully
accepts the definition of himself as pathological as it
is]{.underline}** **[imposed by a world]{.underline}** **[that knows
itself through that imposition]{.underline}**...**[This affirmation...is
a]{.underline}** willing or **[willingness to pay whatever social costs
accrue to being black, to inhabiting blackness, to living black social
life]{.underline}** **[under the]{.underline}** **[shadow]{.underline}**
**[of social death.'' But on the other hand, just as ''blackness
is]{.underline}** **[not reducible to its social costs,'' so ''there is
a relation between]{.underline}** **[nothing and
something]{.underline}** **[or...between death and life.'' If
''pessimism'' allows us to ''discern that we are nothing,'' he calls
''optimism'' the recognition that ''nothing is not
absence]{.underline}**...Poverty in the world is manifest in poetic
access to what it is of the other world that remains unheard, unnoted,
unrecognized in this one. **[\[Whatever\] you call these resources...it
remains to consider precisely what is it that the ones who have nothing
have]{.underline}**...or to which they have access? What comes of it?''
Here, [**[social death]{.underline}** **[does not preclude
agency]{.underline}**; **[agency means occupying
''nothingness]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[itself [in its
fullness,'']{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[and identifying with
those]{.mark} ''who have nothing and [who, in having nothing, have
everything'']{.mark}]{.underline}** (Moten, 2013). In encouraging us to
look and ask what this everything might be, Moten honors the radical
idiom relating Jesus, William Blake, and young Karl Marx, the dionysian
Christianity of Norman O. Brown, the messianism of Walter Benjamin, the
aesthetic of John Coltrane. **[In this dark time, [it seems crucial to
bear witness against]{.mark} violent repetition]{.underline}** **[and
against all the [structur]{.mark}al reasons we should anticipate it,
[but]{.mark} it seems [as crucial to]{.mark} model a politics that
[struggle]{.mark}s [against death by]{.mark} remembering the aporetic
and excessive, [the]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[improvisatory and]{.mark}
the [unexpected]{.mark}, as elements of our]{.underline}** **[democratic
faith]{.underline}**.

RETRENCHMENT: TRANSFORMATION AND LEGITIMATION IN ANTIDISCRIMINATION LAW
101 Harv. L. Rev. 1331 L/N\]

Questioning the Transformative View: Some Doubts About Trashing The
Critics\' product is of limited utility to Blacks in its present form.
The implications for Blacks of trashing liberal legal ideology are
troubling, even though it may be proper to assail belief structures that
obscure liberating possibilities. Trashing legal ideology seems to tell
us repeatedly what has already been established \-- that legal discourse
is unstable and relatively indeterminate. Furthermore**[, trashing
offers no idea of how to avoid the negative consequences of engaging in
reformist discourse or how to work around such consequences. Even if we
imagine the wrong world when we think in terms of legal discourse, we
must nevertheless exist in a present world where legal protection
has]{.underline}** at times **[been a blessing]{.underline}** \--
**[albeit a mixed one]{.underline}**. The fundamental problem is that,
**[although Critics criticize law because it functions to legitimate
existing institutional arrangements[, it is]{.mark} precisely [this
legitimating function that has made law receptive
to]{.mark}]{.underline}** certain **[[demands]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
this area. The Critical **[emphasis on deconstruction as the vehicle for
liberation leads to the conclusion that engaging in legal discourse
should be avoided because it reinforces not only the discourse itself
but also the]{.underline}** society and **[the world that it
embodies]{.underline}**. Yet Critics offer little beyond this
observation. Their **[focus on delegitimating rights rhetoric seems to
suggest that]{.underline}**, once rights rhetoric has been discarded,
**[there exists a more productive strategy for change]{.underline}**,
one **[which does not reinforce existing patterns of
domination]{.underline}**. Unfortunately, **[no such strategy has yet
been articulated]{.underline}**, and **[it is difficult to imagine that
racial minorities will ever be able to discover one.]{.underline}** As
Frances Fox Piven and Richard Cloward point out in their \[\*1367\]
excellent account of the civil rights movement, **[popular struggles are
a reflection of institutionally determined logic and a challenge to that
logic]{.underline}**. 137 **[[People can only demand change in ways that
reflect the logic of the institutions that they are
challenging]{.underline}]{.mark}**. 138 **[[Demands for change that do
not reflect the institutional logic]{.underline}]{.mark}** \-- that is,
demands **[[that]{.mark} do not engage and subsequently
[reinforce]{.mark} the [dominant ideology \-- will]{.mark} probably [be
ineffective]{.mark}.]{.underline}** 139 The possibility for ideological
change is created through the very process of legitimation, which is
triggered by crisis. **[[Powerless people can]{.mark} sometimes
[trigger]{.mark} such a [crisis by challenging an institution]{.mark}
internally, that is, [by using its own logic against
it]{.mark}.]{.underline}** 140 **[[Such crisis occurs when powerless
people force open]{.mark} and politicize [a contradiction between the
dominant ideology and their reality]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The
political consequences \[\*1368\] of maintaining the contradictions may
sometimes force an adjustment \-- an attempt to close the gap or to make
things appear fair. 141 Yet, because the adjustment is triggered by the
political consequences of the contradiction, circumstances will be
adjusted only to the extent necessary to close the apparent
contradiction. **[This approach to]{.underline}** understanding
**[legitimation and change is applicable to]{.underline}** the **[civil
rights]{.underline}** movement. Because Blacks were challenging their
exclusion from political society, the only claims that were likely to
achieve recognition were those that reflected American society\'s
institutional logic: legal rights ideology. Articulating their formal
demands through legal rights ideology, civil rights protestors exposed a
series of contradictions \-- the most important being the promised
privileges of American citizenship and the practice of absolute racial
subordination. **[[Rather than using the contradictions to
suggest]{.mark} that [American citizenship was]{.mark} itself
[illegitimate]{.mark} or false, civil rights [protestors proceeded as
if]{.mark} American [citizenship were real, and demanded to exercise the
"rights"]{.mark} that citizenship [entailed.]{.mark} By seeking to
restructure reality to reflect American mythology]{.underline}**,
**[[Blacks]{.mark}]{.underline}** relied upon and ultimately
**[[benefited]{.mark} from politically inspired efforts to resolve the
contradictions by granting]{.underline}** formal
**[rights.]{.underline}** Although it is the need to maintain legitimacy
that presents powerless groups with the opportunity to wrest concessions
from the dominant order, it is the very accomplishment of legitimacy
that forecloses greater possibilities. In sum, the potential for change
is both created and limited by legitimation.

\*modified for ableist language that we do not endorse

**[These days]{.underline}**, the **[invocation of faith
in]{.underline}** the **[transformative possibility of]{.underline}**
self and **[society risks naiveté]{.underline}**. We live in a time,
after all, when the ties that bind us have badly frayed, when we seem
unable to properly regard the pain of our fellows, and when political
leaders seem hell-bent on exploiting it for gain and to satisfy their
own narcissism. **[To defend the role of faith in political struggle may
seem odd. Yet, hear me out]{.underline}**. Ta-Nehisi Coates's latest
book, We Were Eight Years in Power: An American Tragedy, is his clearest
expression yet of political fatalism---his "deeply held belief that
white supremacy was so foundational to this country that it would not be
defeated in my lifetime, my child\'s lifetime, or perhaps ever." As in
Coates's Between the World and Me (2015), **[[we]{.underline}]{.mark}**
again **[[encounter white supremacy]{.mark} not as a political ideology,
but [as the defining feature of the U.S.]{.mark} polity---its essential
nature]{.underline}**. The book comprises previously published
essays---one for each of the eight years Barack Obama held the
presidency---prefaced by moving biographical and personal meditations
that give each chapter philosophical weight. Taken together, it is about
Obama and the United States---and it is about Coates. It charts the
course of Coates's career from a time when he could not make ends meet
to his recent position of speaking for and to Americans about Black
America. Obama's presidency made this possible; it opened the door for a
"crop of black writers and journalists who achieved prominence during
his two terms." This is also a book about shattering a great
illusion---the idea that Obama's presidency represented black power.
"Obama, his family, and his administration were a walking advertisement
for the ease with which black people could be fully integrated into the
unthreatening mainstream of American culture, politics, and myth. And
that was always the problem." For Coates, Obama represented a
possibility that had always been denied, the idea that a black American
could one day inhabit the highest office of the land. And if a black
American could be president, couldn't the United States be more than the
explicit racism of its past and the institutional racism of its present?
Coates himself was taken by this seductive idea, something he laments
throughout the book. As he explains: It is not so much that I logically
reasoned out that Obama's election would author a post-racist age. But
it now seemed possible that white supremacy, the scourge of American
history might well be banished in my lifetime. In those days I imagined
racism as a tumor that could be isolated and removed from the body of
America, not as a pervasive system both native and essential to that
body. Herein lies the explanation for why a man who curries favor with
white supremacists assumed the presidency after Obama. Donald Trump's
ascendancy was a virulent reaction not only to Obama, but to the idea
that his presidency signaled the country's embrace of a multiracial
polity. **[The running theme]{.underline}** in Coates's book **[is that
white supremacy is native and essential]{.underline}**. It is the source
of his motivation. **[Coates's goal is to distance]{.underline}** both
**[black Americans]{.underline}** and himself **[from thinking of white
supremacy as a focus of transformative politics]{.underline}**. And
**[his theme should guard against the familiar tendency to deny the
national past by invoking its ever-present commitment to
redemption]{.underline}**. Sometimes denial comes in the form of efforts
to sanitize history, Coates tells us, as was the case with Americans
seeking to reconcile themselves to a civil war that was about rights, or
railroads, or tariffs---anything but race. But denial also comes in the
form of believing in "an arc of cosmic justice," the sense "that good
acts were rewarded and bad deeds punished . . . " Coates argues instead
that U.S. history is merely the record of its fundamental nature.
Transcendent stories cannot relieve us of this burden. **[[For
Coates]{.mark}, the [desire to transform the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[reflects]{.mark} a [naïve]{.mark} religious [longing]{.mark}. When
Coates tells us]{.underline}** that "**[cosmic justice, collective hope,
and national redemption" are meaningless]{.underline}** to him, **[he is
asking black Americans to resist the temptation to allow those
things]{.underline}** (which all seem to be interchangeable throughout
the book) **[to have meaning for them]{.underline}**. This is his "black
atheism." **[It removes]{.underline}** the **[desire to appeal to white
Americans because it removes the belief that white Americans are
"interested listeners]{.underline}**" (even if they are regular
readers). In doing so, black Americans arm themselves against
disappointment because they drop their "expectations of white people . .
. " Challenging Coates is difficult, not because of the assuredness of
his analysis, but because of his reputation as "America's best writer on
race." Coates bristles at this reputation, but he has also embraced his
status. He has mastered the balance between speaking to black pain and
suffering (acknowledgement, after all, is so central to one\'s ethical
and political standing in a community otherwise defined by disregarding
black life) and lacerating a class of white Americans, many of whom
perversely see such attacks as moments of cathartic release. This is as
Coates intends. Similar to his affection for hip-hop music---the way in
which he was captured and captivated by the lyricism of its artists---he
seeks to deploy his writings as a talisman. "Out here," he tells us, "in
the concrete and real, sentences should be supernatural, words strung
together until they compelled any listener to repeat them at odd hours .
. . " Coates understands the power of music, and from his love for it,
he crafted his "earliest sense of what writing should mean." His
audience is captured precisely because his words are incantations that
leave them spellbound. But when the United States selects its eloquent
spokesperson on the "race issue"---as it always does---all other voices
become mere noise, and the complexity of our political traditions and
our lived experiences are flattened out. In Coates's view, for instance,
Harriet Tubman, Ida B. Wells, and Martin Luther King Jr. were all
failures. They performed the same script, they failed to move their
audience to action, and they never reshaped U.S. life and culture. "All
of these heroes," Coates insists, "had failed to cajole and coerce the
masters of America." **[In Coates's telling]{.underline}**, **[fine
[historical distinctions disappear]{.mark}, time stands still, and [the
past and future collapse into]{.mark} the political [horrors of the
present]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[This is what happens when [we listen
only to a single voice]{.mark}; no conversation is possible. [We are
~~disabled~~\[prevented\] from speaking]{.mark} thoughtfully and
[accurately about political]{.mark} and cultural [transformation on
racial matters]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But there is a sleight of hand in
**[[Coates]{.mark}'s "black atheism]{.underline}**"; it **[[conflates
hope with certainty]{.mark}, and [hope becomes]{.mark} [our fatal
flaw]{.mark}. Yet [we don't need to believe]{.mark} that [progress is
inevitable to think]{.mark} that, through [our efforts]{.mark}, we
[may]{.mark}]{.underline}** be able to [**[move toward a more just
society]{.underline}**. **[We can]{.underline}**]{.mark}, however,
**[[be sure]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[no good will come of]{.mark}
the [refusal to engage]{.mark} in this work]{.underline}**. There is
much in this that should concern us. Coates describes the pain visited
on black bodies and engenders white guilt. **[He erodes the idea that
who we are need not determine who we may become. He obstructs rather
than opens any attempt to reckon with our racial past and present in the
service of an inclusive future]{.underline}**. And **[he participates in
a politics where words and actions can never aspire to change the
political community]{.underline}** in which we live, **[and for that
reason they only fortify our indignation and deepen our
suspicion]{.underline}**---namely, **[that as black Americans, we are as
alien to this polity as it is alien to us]{.underline}**. The aspiration
to defend a more exalted vision of this country's ethical and political
life is taken as the hallmark of being asleep, dreaming in religious
illusions. To be alive to an unvarnished reality, to be woke, is to
recognize that no such country is possible. **[[This runs roughshod
over]{.mark} that thread in the]{.underline}** grand **[tradition of
U.S. [struggles for justice]{.mark}]{.underline}**---a tradition **[[in
which hope and faith are forged through political darkness]{.mark}. Hope
involves attachment and commitment to the possibility of realizing the
goods we seek. Faith is of a broader significance, providing hope with
content. Faith]{.underline}**, the black scholar Anna Julia Cooper
suggested in 1892, **[is grounded in a vision of political and ethical
life that is at odds with the community one inhabits]{.underline}**. It
is a vision that one believes ought to command allegiance, for which one
is willing to fight, and in which one believes others can find a home.
**[[Faith looks on the present from]{.mark} the perspective of [a future
vision of society, and uses]{.mark} [the vision]{.mark} as a resource
[to remake the present]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And so faith, the
philosopher and psychologist William James explained in 1897, is "the
readiness to act in a cause the prosperous issue of which is not
certified to us in advance." In other words, **[faith has never been
exhausted by the political reality one happens to be living
in]{.underline}**. **[Political faith has always rested on the
idea]{.underline}** that **[we are not finished, a thought that Coates
rejects out of hand]{.underline}**. In the nineteenth century, Ralph
Waldo Emerson called this capacity for human renewal "ascension, or the
passage of the soul into higher forms." In our political life this
means, as James Baldwin well knew, that both **[[our liberal democratic
institutions and its culture "depends on choices one has got to
make]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for ever and ever and ever, **[[every
day]{.underline}]{.mark}**." **[[Faith]{.underline}]{.mark}** has always
been a loving but difficult commitment precisely because it **[[makes
politics about maybes rather than certainties]{.mark}. One of the
greatest dangers of [U.S. exceptionalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**, for
instance, **[is that it has [habituated us to think about]{.mark} the
structure of [political life as necessarily
progressing]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Writing in the wake of the
Montgomery bus boycott---a successful nonviolent campaign against racial
segregation---King sought to chasten the obvious excitement: "Human
progress is neither automatic nor inevitable. **[Even a superficial look
at history reveals that no social advance rolls in on the wheels of
inevitability]{.underline}**." **[Yet [Coates]{.mark} appears
[simply]{.mark} to [invert U.S. exceptionalism, replacing it with the
equally fatalistic idea]{.mark}]{.underline}** that **[[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[is
fundamentally broken]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[In a world [where the
good or bad is fated]{.mark} to happen,]{.underline}** **[[faith]{.mark}
and hope [have no foothold]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.
**[This]{.underline}**]{.mark} ultimately **[[weakens]{.mark} our
[resolve]{.mark}]{.underline}** and undermines our ability to take
seriously the idea of an "American experiment." **[Black activists have
not forged their faith with the stone of U.S.
exceptionalism]{.underline}**. Rather, **[they have used their darkest
hours to "make a way out of no way"---to address the triple crises
of]{.underline}** **[exclusion, domination, and violence]{.underline}**.
Abolitionists such as David Walker faced it in the form of the
enslavement of black folks. Frederick Douglass encountered it with the
rise and crash of reconstruction. Wells faced it as she confronted the
horror of lynching and the disposability of black life. And in our own
time, Black Lives Matter (BLM) activists are reminded of a similar
disposability of black life that goes unpunished. And yet, they are
keepers of the faith, recognizing that its **[vitality is not exhausted
by the reality they struggle against]{.underline}**. In her recent New
York Times article, "Black Lives Matter Is Democracy in Action," Barbara
Ransby narrates **[a powerful account of [BLM activists creating
contexts for collective leadership]{.mark} and using those opportunities
[to]{.mark} transform the power of voice into actions that [meet]{.mark}
the [needs of ordinary people]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This effort
**[[would be impossible for people who accept Coates's
perspective]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Their efforts may not win the day,
but they certainly won't win the day without the faith that winning is a
possibility. **[[Faith does not deny the present, but refuses to be
defined by it]{.mark} and sink into it. We now face a president who
seeks to colonize every waking moment of our lives with feelings of
dread]{.underline}**, thus arresting our ability to imagine a reality
beyond television, social media feeds, and newspapers. **[The [illusion
of our present]{.mark} moment [is not expressed in]{.mark} political
[faith, but in the belief]{.mark} that [we can respond constructively
without]{.mark} such [faith]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Political faith
is]{.mark} fully [realistic about]{.mark} the [present disasters and
rejects illusions about assured]{.mark} future
[progress]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[while also
insisting]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[that [we are not certain to
fail]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[It is hopeful without being
optimistic]{.underline}**. **[We may falter,]{.underline}** and the
material, psychological, and political goods of **[white supremacy may
deplete our desire to transform. We know the
history]{.underline}**---from the 1880s to the 1960s---**[of white
backlash in response to a more expansive racial justice]{.underline}**.
In fact, we are living through one such backlash given the ascendancy of
Trump. **[But our [political community is what it is because we have
made it]{.mark} this way. [It is not fated]{.mark} to be]{.underline}**.
**[[Believing otherwise makes white supremacy something more]{.mark}
than a collection of choices, habits, and
[practices]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[[it makes it part of human
nature]{.underline}]{.mark}** itself. Coates wants us to face the facts
and embrace black atheism. But throughout the book he often slides from
working in the historical register to speaking in the idiom of
philosophical metaphysics---at one moment he stands in time and at
another he stands outside of it, confidently telling us how history will
end. For this reason, **[[Coates doesn\'t dismantle white supremacy;
he]{.mark} ironically [provides it]{.mark} with
[support]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Please understand my concern. Coates is
right: he doesn't have a "responsibility to be hopeful or optimistic or
make anyone feel better about the world." **[We must]{.underline}**, as
he has often done, **[speak the truth. But we must not claim to know
what we cannot possibly know.]{.underline}** **[Humility creates space
for hope]{.underline}**. This is why James Baldwin remains so helpful
and why his work is ubiquitous these days. **[The U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, he insisted, **[is a collection of
choices]{.underline}**. And precisely for this reason, we must learn how
to let go of former identities as we quest after better ones. He was not
a political strategist, but a keen observer and analyst of U.S.
political and ethical culture and in this regard, his writings are
directed to cultivating a new orientation. Baldwin's insight for us was
that we find it challenging to live together precisely because we have
not always understood what it means to allow features of ourselves to
perish. In depicting our many selves, Baldwin reduces the burden of
letting go. **[If there is only one self at stake]{.underline}**, as
Coates believes, **[if white supremacy is the country's only identity,
then letting go is entering an abyss]{.underline}**.

**[Perhaps]{.underline}**, as so many tell us, **[[the sun is setting
on]{.mark} the [U.S. empire]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The death of an
empire is nothing to lament, tied as intimately as empires are to death
and destruction. **[But [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[is not only an empire]{.mark}. Its
[liberal democratic tendencies]{.mark} run deep and [have often been
used]{.mark} not merely for good, but [to bring about]{.mark} the [good
as it relates to racial equality. As]{.mark} the [empire dies, why
should we abandon the idea]{.mark} that [something new may yet be
born?]{.mark} What [we must]{.mark} ask]{.underline}** ourselves now, is
what in our past might we retrieve for our present, **[how might those
resources be reimagined to [articulate]{.mark} a [political
faith]{.mark} [more]{.mark} humane and [just than]{.mark} the

### at: slavery

#### Using slavery as a metaphor to describe the current racial nomos obscures the material operations that make white supremacy a reality. Manichean dichotomies aren't useful

Paul **GILROY**, professor of American and English literature at King's
College London, interview with George Yancy, professor of philosophy at
Duquesne University, **15** \["What 'Black Lives' Means in Britain,"

G.Y.: You've written about the Middle Passage, about that tragic
transportation of African bodies across the Atlantic. Violent
disciplining of the black body, rendering it docile, was one mechanism
at work during that passage. **[What ways to do think contemporary black
people]{.underline}** in the United States or in Britain **[continue to
undergo forms of violent discipline?]{.underline}**

P.G.: **[[There are many connections between the ways]{.mark} that
[we]{.mark} inhabit and [reproduce the contemporary racial order
and]{.mark} the period of [slavery. However, we are not slaves. It's
important not to let slavery slip into being a metaphor and blur the
difference between our condition and]{.mark} the predicament of the
[slaves. The racial nomos has changed]{.mark} since the 18th century.
[How racial hierarchy]{.mark} and the exploitation it sanctions and the
terror it requires [link the past to the present needs to be
understood]{.mark} very carefully]{.underline}**. I know I am stepping
away from the political liturgy or code used in American discussions of
race and politics, but **[I don't care for Manichaean styles of thought.
[Abstract]{.mark} and reified [magnitudes like "whiteness"
aren't]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in my view, **[very [helpful in
interpreting what is]{.mark}]{.underline}** now **[[going
on]{.underline}]{.mark}** around us. **[Racial categories have to be
denatured. [We have to see]{.mark}]{.underline}**, for example,
**[[how]{.mark} that [whiteness is assembled and brought to
actual]{.mark} and virtual [life. What are its]{.mark} historical,
[economic and social conditions of existence? How does it become
articulated to juridical]{.mark}]{.underline}**, scientific, medical,
aesthetic, **[[military and technological forms of expertise? These are
concrete problems that open whiteness up to multilayered
struggle]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

G.Y.: I certainly understand your point. Yet black people in America
understand that, in so many instances, they are being shot and killed by
white police officers who are sworn to protect them. They understand how
white life matters differently. And even if that life is poor, it is
still white. And they understand the reality of white privilege. Isn't
there a way in which this is a real phenomenon to be reckoned with?
**[Black people]{.underline}**, it seems to me **[are not responsible
for creating a racial Manichaean reality of "us"]{.underline}** (blacks)
**[versus "them"]{.underline}** (whites).

P.G.: In "Wretched of the Earth," Frantz **[Fanon speaks powerfully
about the need and the difficulty of getting beyond this Manichaean
perspective]{.underline}**. He describes how **[[the Manichaeism of the
colonizer creates the Manichaeism of the colonized. That reaction cannot
be avoided but it is]{.mark} also [a bad place to get
stuck]{.mark}]{.underline}**. You speak of privilege here. I know this
is now the language many people use to talk about racial hierarchy but
I'm not comfortable with that as a shorthand term for capturing the
complex machinery of inequality. It makes power simply a possession
rather than a relationship.

### 2ac util

**Util is good**

**Bowden 9**

Peter Bowden (University of Sydney, Australian Association for
Professional and Applied Ethics). "In Defense of Utilitarianism." Annual
Conference: Australian Association for Professional and Applied Ethics,
June 2009. http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1534305

[The most significant reason for advocating [utility theory]{.mark}
however, is that it [is useful]{.mark} and usable. The [institutions in
our society]{.mark} -- the professional, industry and special interest
groups, as well as organisations in business and government, plus the
not for profit sector - [are faced with]{.mark} many [ethical decisions,
often complex and difficult, requiring]{.mark} considerable thought, and
[eventual]{.mark}ly [resolution.]{.mark} The moral issues that arise in
these contexts are fundamental to the institutional functioning of our
society. **[Yet very few people have training in]{.mark} moral
[philosophy. They need a relatively straightforward way of making these
decisions]{.mark}** -- of telling right from wrong.]{.underline} Mill,
it will be argued, provides that method. Many who have no training that
are faced with these ethical choices will rely on intuition. [[Perhaps
they will use]{.mark} a set of [values learned at home]{.mark}, or from
their schooling or their church. As we shall see [for]{.mark} the [more
difficult ethical issues, however, intuition is an unreliable
guide.]{.mark} If they have training, they may remember virtue ethics,
or Kant's deontology, but as I shall also argue later, these theories do
not necessarily give straightforward and acceptable
answers.]{.underline} The statement that some ethical issues are
difficult to resolve should generate little disagreement. Any teacher of
professional ethics can identify issues where the profession disagrees
on the ethics of a particular practice. Reverse auctions, for instance,
where providers of the product or service bid increasingly lower prices,
have generated debate on whether we are sacrificing quality or safety
for a lower price. Front end loading, where the work items executed
earlier are loaded 3 with a higher percentage of the supplier‟s
overheads has generated a similar debate. Whistleblowing is yet another
issue where the ethics are debated - whether the person revealing the
wrongdoing is ignoring the ethical obligation of loyalty to his or her
employer. Or whether the risk of retaliation and losing one‟s job
outweighs the moral obligation to reveal the truth. We are also all
aware of the concept of group think, where people in an organisation
tend to accept the prevailing opinion, rather than question it. This may
have been a cause behind many of the ethical failures seen over recent
years in HIH, James Hardie, the Australian Wheat Board and other
companies. The fact that no executive spoke out against the unethical
behaviours then practised tells us that those who want honesty and
transparency were not confident enough of themselves or their judgement
to speak out. Alternatively, the failure to speak out may have been due
to the tendency to find a justification for an unethical action. Wheat
Board people possibly convinced themselves for instance, that they were
acting in the best interests of the Australian farmer, and therefore of
the nation. And so the national benefits outweighed the negatives of
their action. [A relatively straight forward way to cut through such
fuzzy thinking would be the prior resolution of many of these issues.
[Util]{.mark}itarianism, it will be argued, [provides]{.mark} that
method. It would give [those who wish to live]{.mark} and work [within
an ethical environment stronger tools with which to]{.mark} decide how
they should [react.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**Extinction first -- VTL inevitable**

**Bernstein '2** (Richard J., Vera List Prof. Phil. -- New School for
Social Research, "Radical Evil: A Philosophical Interrogation", p.
188-192)

[[There is a basic value inherent in]{.mark} organic [being]{.mark}, a
basic affirmation, \"The Yes\' of Life\" (IR 81). 15 \"The
self-affirmation of being becomes [emphatic in the opposition]{.mark} of
life [to death]{.mark}]{.underline}. Life is the explicit confrontation
of being with not-being. . . . The \'yes\' of all striving is here
sharpened by the active \`no\' to not-being\" (IR 81-2). Furthermore ---
and this is the crucial point for Jonas --- [[this affirmation]{.mark}
of life that is in all organic being **[has a binding obligatory
force]{.mark}** upon human beings. This blindly self-enacting \"yes\"
gains obligating force in the seeing freedom of man, who as the supreme
outcome of nature\'s purposive labor is no longer its automatic executor
but, with the power obtained from knowledge, can become its destroyer as
well. He must adopt the \"yes\" into his will and impose the \"no\" to
not-being on his power]{.underline}. But precisely this transition from
willing to obligation is the critical point of moral theory at which
attempts at laying a foundation for it come so easily to grief. Why does
now, in man, that become a duty which hitherto \"being\" itself took
care of through all individual willings? (IR 82). We discover here the
transition from is to \"ought\" --- from the self-affirmation of life to
the binding obligation of human beings to preserve life not only for the
present but also for the future. But why do we need a new ethics? The
subtitle of The Imperative of Responsibility --- In Search of an Ethics
for the Technological Age --- indicates why we need a new ethics.
[[Modern technology]{.mark} has [transformed]{.mark} the nature and
[consequences of human action so]{.mark} radically that the underlying
premises of **[traditional ethics are no longer valid]{.mark}**. For the
first time in history [human beings possess]{.mark} the knowledge and
the [power to destroy]{.mark} life on [this planet]{.mark}, including
human life. Not only is there the new possibility of total nuclear
disaster; there are the even more invidious and threatening
possibilities that result from the unconstrained use of technologies
that can destroy the environment required for life.]{.underline} The
major transformation brought about by modern technology is that the
consequences of our actions frequently exceed by far anything we can
envision. Jonas was one of the first philosophers to warn us about the
unprecedented ethical and political problems that arise with the rapid
development of biotechnology. He claimed that this was happening at a
time when there was an \"ethical vacuum,\" when there did not seem to be
any effective ethical principles to limit ot guide our ethical
decisions. In the name of scientific and technological \"progress,\"
there is a relentless pressure to adopt a stance where virtually
anything is permissible, includ-ing transforming the genetic structure
of human beings, as long as it is \"freely chosen.\" [We
need]{.underline}, Jonas argued, [[a new categorical imperative]{.mark}
that [might be]{.mark}]{.underline} formulated [as follows:]{.underline}
\"[Act so that the effects of your action are compatible with the
permanence of genuine human life\"; or expressed
negatively]{.underline}: \"Act so that the effects of your action are
not destructive of the future possibility of such a life\"; or simply:
\"[**[Do not compromise]{.mark}** the]{.underline} [conditions for **[an
indefinite continuation of humanity on earth]{.mark}**\"; or again
turned positive:]{.underline} \"In your present choices, include the
future wholeness of Man among the objects of your will.\"

### 2ac cap sustainable

#### Unsustainable arguments are wrong -- no resource crunch

**Saunders 16** (Harry Saunders, Senior Fellow at the Breakthrough
Institute, 2016 ("Does Capitalism Require Endless Growth?,"
*Breakthrough Institute,* Summer, Iss. 6, Accessible Online at
<http://thebreakthrough.org/index.php/journal/issue-6/does-capitalism-require-endless-growth>)

The argument of Malthus was famously resurrected in the early 1970s in
the Club of Rome report The Limits to Growth.1 Around the same time,
ecological economists Nicholas Georgescu-Rosen, Herman Daly, Robert
Costanza, Robert Ayres, and others advanced the idea that all human
economic activity fundamentally relies on a limited planetary endowment
of what they call "natural capital." On the other side, **[Marxist
scholars]{.underline}** like Paul Sweezy2, Fred Magdoff, and John
Foster3 **[have extended Marx's insight, directing our attention to what
they call the "growth imperative of capitalism,"]{.underline}** by which
they mean the indispensable necessity of capitalism to continually
accumulate capital and generate a reserve of unemployed workers if it is
to remain viable. **[Without continual economic growth, they argue,
capitalism will collapse]{.underline}**. Or, as Giorgos Kallis recently
so succinctly put it, "Growth is what capitalism needs, knows, and
does."4

Taken together, the dilemma is evident: An economic system that requires
perpetual economic growth on a spherical planet with finite resources
simply cannot last.

Merging Marx and Malthus in this way has made Malthusian arguments
accessible to elements of the global left that had historically rejected
them. Capitalism and environmental sustainability simply could not be
reconciled. Constraining the economy to keep it within a safe margin of
ecological limits would only hasten capitalism's collapse, while
allowing capitalism to grow unconstrained would result in ecological
collapse. **[Either way, the choice was clear: abandon capitalism or
risk the end of the human project.]{.underline}**

**[But Marx and Malthus are not so easily reconciled.]{.underline}**
Marx's central insight was that capitalism would collapse of its own
contradictions, including rising inequality and immiseration of labor
that would ultimately destroy the market for the goods that capitalists
produced. As it turns out, the mechanism by which this would occur,
technological change driving greater economic productivity, was
precisely the mechanism that Malthus failed to anticipate when he
predicted that food production would fail to keep up with population
growth. In Marx's crisis lay precisely the mechanism that would prevent
Malthus' prophecy.

**[We see much evidence for this today. Improving technologies have
driven a major expansion in food availability, along with continuing
production efficiencies across the global economy more generally. The
world faces no shortage of ecological challenges]{.underline}** ---
species extinctions, collapsing fisheries, depleted aquifers, poisoned
land, and, of course, the inexorable rise of global temperatures as
atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases increase. And economists
today concern themselves with the threat of "secular stagnation,"
chronically low growth rates that threaten long-term prosperity.

**[But it is important to distinguish these challenges
from]{.underline}** the **[sweeping claims]{.underline}** made
originally by Sweezy, Magdoff, and Foster and repeated today by
prominent intellectuals and activists such as Naomi Klein and Bill
McKibben. In the pages that follow, I will demonstrate that both
neoclassical growth theory and empirical evidence suggest that
**[capitalist economies do not require endless growth but are rather
much more likely to evolve toward a steady state once consumption
demands of the global population have been satisfied]{.underline}**.
Those demands demonstrably saturate once economies achieve a certain
level of affluence. For these reasons, **[a capitalist economy is as
likely as any other to see stable and declining demands on natural
resources and ecological services]{.underline}**. Indeed, with the right
policies and institutions, **[capitalist economies are more likely to
achieve high living standards and low environmental impacts than just
about any other economic system]{.underline}**.

**Neolib is sustainable and the alt is a useless political abstraction**

**[Arvidsson 13]{.underline}**---teaches sociology at the University of
Milano

(Adam, "Thinking beyond neo-liberalism: A response to Detlev Zwick",
ephemera: theory & politics in organization 13(2): 407-412)

This makes it trickier to do critical theory. **[We can of course still
criticize the actual state of things]{.underline}**. We can point to the
precarious relations that prevail among creative knowledge workers; show
how exploitative and unjust conditions are intensified by the very
forces that drive the globalization of communicative capitalism, like
the outsourcing of design work; or lament the fact that a triumphant
neoliberal regime subsumes and appropriates aspects of subjectivity and
social life that we think should have been left alone. To produce such
critiques remains useful intellectual work -- I have done it in other
contexts (Arvidsson et al., 2010; Arvidsson, 2007), as has Detlev Zwick
(2008), and many others. To the extent that such critiques reach a mass
audience, they can become a progressive impulse to action and reflection
-- as in the case of Naomi Klein's work inspiring the 'no global'
movement (to use an inadequate name coined by the mainstream press). But
**[such a critique without an alternative remains
unsatisfactory]{.underline}** for at least three reasons. First, and
most superficially, **[since everyone else is doing it, the marginal
utility of yet another piece of critical theory rapidly diminishes, as
does the intellectual satisfaction that can be derived]{.underline}**
form producing it. Second, and more seriously, **[[the absence of a
realistic alt]{.mark}ernative, or even of a historical subject in the
name of which such a critique can be pronounced, [risks
rendering]{.mark} [critical theory moralistic and]{.mark} rather
[toothless]{.mark}]{.underline}**. We might agree with Zwick when he
suggests that **[the outsourcing of design work]{.underline}** from
Toronto to the Philippines **[is]{.underline}** somehow **[wrong, but it
is difficult to understand exactly why this would be the
case]{.underline}**. (Why shouldn't Philippine designers be allowed to
compete with Canadian designers? Can the 'creative class' claim an
exemption from the global economy? Perhaps the answer is 'yes', but I do
not know of any viable alternative vision of society that is able to
substantiate that 'yes'.) Third, and most importantly, **[in the absence
of an alternative vision, [critical theory remains]{.mark} rather
[unconvincing to the people in the name of whom it proposes to
speak]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} I can assure you -- and I've
tried! -- that **[you won't become an organic intellectual among social
entrepreneurs or precarious creative workers by telling them that they
are exploited, that they sell out their subjectivity, or that the system
in which they operate is unjust. [Pure critique is simply not attractive
enough to make]{.mark} [the multitude of]{.mark} new productive
[subjects]{.mark}, fragmented by neoliberalism, [cohere]{.mark} into a
historical subject. To do that you need at least the myth of an
alternative]{.underline}**, as agitators from Sorel via Lenin to
Subcomandante Marcos could tell you. Don't get me wrong. I am not
proposing that it is wrong to point to the precarious conditions of
**[[knowledge]{.mark} work]{.underline}**, or that we should not do this
as academics and researchers. This **[[is]{.mark} still an
[important]{.mark} task. [But it is not enough]{.mark}. [Critical
theory]{.mark} must do this, but it must also do more. It [must]{.mark}
also [engage with]{.mark} the question of [what a realistic
alt]{.mark}ernative [to neolib]{.mark}eralism [could]{.mark} [be, and it
must elaborate a realistic political vision]{.mark} in the name of which
a critique that is productive and progressive, and not simply
moralistic, can be articulated]{.underline}**. By realistic, I mean that
**[such an alternative must be sought in the actual relations of
production that characterize the contemporary information
economy]{.underline}**. **[[Zwick's suggestion that we imagine]{.mark} a
commonism of productive consumption as collaborative
sharing]{.underline}** in the absence of private property and combined
with an inclusive model of political determination, collective
sovereignty, belonging and justice -- and so on -- **[[is]{.mark} simply
[unproductive]{.mark}]{.underline}** to my mind. **[We might all agree
that an economy of commons that has done away with capitalism might be
more desirable, but the reality is that hybrid forms]{.underline}**,
like the game modders that Zwick cites, where a an economy of commons
co-exists with a capitalist value logic, in some form,
**[are]{.underline}** indeed **[becoming the norm]{.underline}**. At
that point **[the interesting thing to do is not so much to criticize
the enduring capitalist nature of these hybrid forms, but rather to
investigate the new forms of politics that they might give rise to.
This]{.underline}** in no way implies that one does away with conflict
and politics. Rather, it **[implies investigating and understanding the
new spaces and discourses through which such a new type of politics can
be articulated]{.underline}**. In order to do this **[we must start with
what the actors involved in these processes actually think themselves.
[It is]{.mark} quite [useless to simply deploy]{.mark} [existing
philosophical perspectives, or to compare]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
**[[reality]{.underline}]{.mark}** of communicative capitalism **[[to
utopian projections]{.mark} of the political visions of last
century]{.underline}**. Instead we must start with the 'empirical
metaphysics', to use Bruno Latour's term, that actually prevail among
people engaged in such hybrid practices. **[[We might]{.mark} all
[want]{.mark} [to do away with neolib]{.mark}eralism and the forms of
life that it has promoted. [But]{.mark}]{.underline}** at the same time,
**[[we all recognize that the neoliberal project has been]{.mark} [one
of the most successful projects]{.mark} of
governmentality]{.underline}** since, perhaps, the very project of
disciplinary power that Foucault himself described. Rebus sic stantibus
**[[we cannot]{.mark} [simply wish it away]{.mark}. We need to recognize
that people have changed, that [competitive
individualism]{.mark}]{.underline}**, self-branding and an
entrepreneurial mentality **[[are,]{.underline}]{.mark}** by now,
**[normal [features of life]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The same thing goes
for the popular political myths that prevail among advanced knowledge
workers, what Zwick calls 'cyber-utopianism'. We need to recognize that
notions like peer-to-peer production, high-tech gift economies and the
like have the power to mobilize the energies of the subjects that are
most likely to become the pioneers of a new political vision -- today's
version of the skilled workers that have taken the lead in most modern
political movements. Even though the social theory that they produce
might be shallow and imperfect, and even though they might not have read
Marx and Foucault as well as we have, we cannot simply dismiss this
vision as a mere ideology to be replaced by our theoretically more
refined ideology. Like the relations of production that are emerging in
communicative capitalism and the subjectivity of knowledge workers,
these myths are part of the raw material with which the Gramscian
intellectual must engage in order to articulate new understandings of
common sense that are both politically progressive and intuitively
attractive to the people that they are supposed to mobilize. **[In other
words, in order to articulate an alternative, we cannot simply dismiss
the reality of communicative capitalism and fall back on what remains of
the political utopias of last century. [We need to engage with the
reality of neoliberal]{.mark} communicative
[capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}** and try to push its dialectic beyond
its apolitical present state. **[We must investigate what the real
conditions of production and imagination are and ask ourselves where
they might lead. Critical theory needs to become an empirical, and not
simply a philosophical, enterprise]{.underline}.**

### \--at: system collapse

**The system is resilient -- it'll bounce back**

**Foster 9** (JD, Norman B. Ture Senior Fellow in the Economics of
fiscal policy -- Heritage Foundation, \"Is Capitalism Dead? Maybe,\"
3-11, http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=101694302)

[[Capitalism is]{.mark} down. It may even be out. But it\'s **[far from
dead]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Capitalism is **extremely
resilient**]{.mark}. Why? [Because]{.mark} here]{.underline}, as in
every democratic-industrial country around the world, [[it has always
had to struggle]{.mark} to survive [against]{.mark} encroachments ---
both benign and malevolent --- of [the state]{.mark}. At the moment,
capitalism is losing ground most everywhere. But [when the]{.mark}
economic [crisis passes, capitalism]{.mark} and the freedoms it
engenders [will **recover again**]{.mark}, if only because freedom beats
its lack.]{.underline} It is said that the trouble with socialism is
socialism; the trouble with capitalism is capitalists. The socialist
economic system, inherently contrary to individual liberties, tends to
minimize prosperity because it inevitably allocates national resources
inefficiently. On the other hand, a truly capitalist system engaged in
an unfettered pursuit of prosperity is prone to occasional and often
painful excesses, bubbles and downturns like the one we are now
experiencing globally. When capitalism slips, governments step in with
regulations and buffers to try to moderate the excesses and minimize the
broader consequences of individual errors. Sometimes these policies are
enduringly helpful. Severe economic downturns inflict collateral damage
on families and businesses otherwise innocent of material foolishness.
Not only are the sufferings of these innocents harmful to society, but
they are also downright expensive. A little wise government buffering
can go a long way. The trick, of course, is the wisdom part. A good
example of a wise government buffer is deposit insurance at commercial
banks. Without it, depositors would have withdrawn their funds en masse,
leading to a rapid collapse of the banking system. It happened in years
gone by. But today, deposits have flowed into the banking system in
search of safety, helping banks staunch their many severe wounds. Yet
for every example of helpful government intervention, there are many
more that do more harm than good. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac leap to
mind. These congressional creatures helped create, then inflate the
subprime market. When that balloon popped, it triggered a global
economic meltdown. [The current financial crisis clearly has capitalism
on its back foot.]{.underline} Government ownership of the largest
insurance company, the major banks, and Fan and Fred are awesome
incursions into private markets. But, as President Obama has
underscored, these incursions are only temporary. [In time]{.underline},
these [institutions]{.underline} --- even Fan and Fred --- [will be
broken up and sold in parts. It will leave government agents with
stories to tell their grandkids, and taxpayers stuck with the
losses]{.underline}. [But [the power of the state will]{.mark} again
[recede, and **another new age of**]{.mark} freedom and **[capitalism
will arrive and thrive]{.mark}**... [until we repeat the cycle
again]{.mark} sometime down the road.]{.underline}

The Case for No Limits to Growth Notwithstanding all of the above, I
want to reassert that [by imagineering an alternative
future]{.underline}---based on solid science and technology--- we [can
create a situation in which there are "[no limits to
growth]{.mark}]{.underline}." [It [begins with]{.mark} a [new]{.mark}
paradigm for [food production]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[now under
development]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [the urban vertical
farm.]{.underline} This is a concept popularized by Prof. Dickson
Despommier of Columbia University.30 [[A]{.mark} 30-story urban
[vertical]{.mark}]{.underline} [[farm]{.mark} located on five square
acres could yield food **for fifty thousand people**]{.underline}. [We
are talking about high-tech installations that would multiply
productivity by a factor of 480]{.underline}: four growing seasons,
times twice the density of crops, times two growing levels on each
floor, times 30 floors = 480. [This means that **five acres** of land
can **produce the equivalent of 2,600 acres of conventionally planted
and tended crops**. Just 160 such buildings]{.underline} occupying only
800 acres [could feed the entire city of New York]{.underline}. Given
this calculus, **[an area [the size of Denmark could feed the entire
human race]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Vertical farms]{.mark} would be
self-sustaining.]{.underline} Located contiguous to or inside urban
centers, [they could also contribute to urban renewal.]{.underline}
[They would be urban lungs]{.underline}, [improving the air quality of
cities.]{.underline} [They would produce a varied food
supply]{.underline} [year-round]{.underline}. [They would **[use 90%
less water]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [Since agriculture consumes
two-thirds of the water worldwide, mass adoption of [this]{.mark}
technology [would solve humanity's water problem]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Food would no longer need to be transported to market]{.underline}; it
would be produced at the market [and would not require use of petroleum
intensive agricultural equipment. [This, **along with
less**]{.mark}**ened use of [pesticides]{.mark}, herbicides [and
fertilizers,]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[would]{.mark} not only [be better
for the environment]{.mark} but would eliminate agriculture's dependence
on petroleum [and]{.mark} **[significantly reduce petroleum
demand]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Despite increased efficiencies, direct
(energy) and indirect (fertilizers, etc.) energy use represented over
13% of farm expenses in 2005-2008 and have been increasing as the price
of oil rises.31 Many of [the world's damaged [ecosystems would be
repaired by]{.mark} the consequent [abandonment of
farmland]{.mark}]{.underline}. A "**[rewilding"]{.underline}** of our
planet would take place. [Forests, jungles and savannas would reconquer
nature, increasing habitat and becoming giant CO2 "sinks]{.underline},"
[sucking up]{.underline} the [excess CO2]{.underline} that the
industrial revolution has pumped into the atmosphere. [Countries
**already investigating**]{.underline} the adoption of [such technology
include Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and
China]{.underline}---countries that are water starved or highly
populated. Material Science, Resources and Energy [The]{.underline}
embryonic [revolution in material]{.underline} [science now taking place
is the key to "no limits to growth]{.underline}." I refer to "smart" and
superlight materials. [[Smart materials]{.underline}]{.mark} "are
materials that have one or more properties that can be significantly
changed in a controlled fashion by external stimuli." 32 They [can
produce energy by exploiting differences in temperature]{.underline}
(thermoelectric materials) [or by being stressed]{.underline}
(piezoelectric materials). Other smart materials save energy in the
manufacturing process by changing shape or repairing themselves as a
consequence of various external stimuli. [These materials have all
passed the "**proof of concept**" phase]{.underline} (i.e., are
scientifically sound) and many are in the prototype phase. [Some
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} **[already [commercialized and
penetrating]{.mark} [the market]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} For
example, the Israeli company [Innowattech has underlain a one-kilometer
stretch of local highway with]{.underline} piezoelectric [material to
"harvest]{.underline}" the [wasted stress energy of
vehicles]{.underline} passing over and convert it to electricity.33 They
reckon that [Israel has stretches of road that can efficiently produce
250 megawatts.]{.underline} If this is verified, consider the tremendous
electricity potential of the New Jersey Turnpike or the thruways of Los
Angeles and elsewhere. Consider the potential of railway and subway
tracks. [We are talking about tens of thousands of potential megawatts
produced without any fossil fuels.]{.underline} Additional energy is
derivable from [thermoelectric materials]{.underline}, which [can
transform wasted heat into electricity]{.underline}. As Christopher
Steiner notes, [capturing waste heat from manufacturing]{.underline}
alone [in the United States would provide an additional 65,000
megawatts]{.underline}: "enough for 50 million homes."34 [**Smart
glass** is]{.underline} [already commercialized and can save significant
energy]{.underline} in heating, airconditioning and lighting---up to 50%
saving in energy has been achieved in retrofitted legacy buildings (such
as the former Sears Tower in Chicago). New buildings, designed to take
maximum advantage of this and other technologies could save even more.
[Buildings consume 39% of America's energy and 68% of its
electricity]{.underline}. They emit 38% of the carbon dioxide, 49% of
the sulfur dioxide, and 25% of the nitrogen oxides found in the air.35
Even greater savings in electricity could be realized by replacing
incandescent and fluorescent light bulbs with LEDS which use 1/10th the
electricity of incandescent and half the electricity of fluorescents.
[These three steps]{.underline}: [[transforming waste heat into]{.mark}
[electricity,]{.mark} retrofitting buildings with [smart glass, and LED
lighting]{.mark}, [could cut America's]{.mark} electricity consumption
and its **[CO2 emissions by 50% within 10 years]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
They would also generate hundreds of thousands of jobs in construction
and home improvements. [Coal]{.underline} driven electricity generation
[would become a thing of the past.]{.underline} The coal released could
be liquefied or gasified (by new environmentally friendly technologies)
into the energy equivalent of 3.5 million barrels of oil a day. This is
equivalent to the amount of oil the United States imports from the
Persian Gulf and Venezuela together.36 [Conservation of energy and
parasitic energy harvesting]{.underline}, [as well as urban agriculture
would cut the planet's energy consumption and air and water pollution
significantly]{.underline}. **[[Waste-to-energy]{.mark} technologies
[could]{.mark} begin to [replace fossil fuels]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[Garbage, sewage, organic trash, and agricultural and food processing
waste]{.underline} are essentially hydrocarbon resources that can be
transformed into ethanol, methanol, and biobutanol or biodiesel. These
[can be used for transportation, electricity generation or as feedstock
for plastics and other materials]{.underline}. [Waste-to-energy
is]{.underline} essentially a [recycling of CO2 from the environment
instead of introducing new CO2]{.underline} into the environment.
[Waste-to-energy also prevents the production, and release]{.underline}
from rotting organic waste, [of **methane**]{.underline}---[a greenhouse
gas 25 times more powerful than CO2]{.underline}. Methane accounts for
18% of the manmade greenhouse effect. Not as much as CO2, which
constitutes 72%, but still considerable (landfills emit as much
greenhouse gas effect, in the form of methane, as the CO2 from all the
vehicles in the world). [Numerous [prototypes]{.mark} of a variety of
waste-to-energy technologies [are]{.mark} already [in
place.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[When]{.mark} their [declining costs
meet]{.mark} the [rising costs of fossil fuels]{.mark}, [they
will]{.mark} become commercialized]{.underline} [and,]{.underline} if
history is any judge, [will [replace fossil fuels **very
quickly**]{.mark}]{.underline}---just as coal replaced wood in a matter
of decades and petroleum replaced whale oil in a matter of years.
Superlight Materials But [it is superlight materials that have the
greatest potential to transform civilization and,]{.underline} in
conjunction with the above, to [usher in the "no limits to growth"
era]{.underline}. I refer, in particular, to car-bon
nanotubes---alternatively referred to as Buckyballs or Buckypaper (in
honor of Buckminster Fuller). [Carbon nanotubes are]{.underline} between
[1/10,000th]{.underline} and 1/50,000th the [width of a human
hair]{.underline}, [more flexible than rubber and 100-500 times stronger
than steel]{.underline} per unit of weight. Imagine the energy savings
if planes, cars, trucks, trains, elevators---everything that needs
energy to move---were made of this material and weighed 1/100th what
they weigh now. Imagine the types of alternative energy that would
become practical. Imagine the positive impact on the environment:
replacing many industrial processes and mining, and thus lessening air
and groundwater pollution. Present costs and production methods make
this impractical but that infinite resource---the human mind---has
confronted and solved many problems like this before. Let us take the
example of aluminum. A hundred fifty years ago, aluminum was more
expensive than gold or platinum.37 When Napoleon III held a banquet, he
provided his most honored guests with aluminum plates.
Less-distinguished guests had to make do with gold! When the Washington
Monument was completed in 1884, it was fitted with an aluminum cap---the
most expensive metal in the world at the time---as a sign of respect to
George Washington. It weighed 2.85 kilograms, or 2,850 grams. Aluminum
at the time cost \$1 a gram (or \$1,000 a kilogram). A typical day
laborer working on the monument was paid \$1 a day for 10-12 hours a
day. In other words, today's common soft-drink can, which weighs 14
grams, could have bought 14 ten-hour days of labor in 1884.38 Today's
U.S. minimum wage is \$7.50 an hour. Using labor as the measure of
value, [a soft drink can would cost \$1,125]{.underline} today (or
\$80,000 a kilogram), [were it not for a new method of processing
aluminum ore.]{.underline} The Hall-Héroult process turned aluminum into
one of the cheapest commodities on earth only two years after the
Washington Monument was capped with aluminum. Today aluminum costs \$3 a
kilogram, or \$3000 a metric ton. The soft drink can that would have
cost \$1,125 today without the process now costs \$0.04. [Today the
average cost of industrial grade carbon nanotubes is about \$50-\$60 a
kilogram.]{.underline} This is already far cheaper in real cost than
aluminum was in 1884. [Yet revolutionary methods of production are now
being developed that will drive costs down even more
radically.]{.underline} [[At Cambridge]{.underline}]{.mark} University
[[they are working on a]{.mark} new electrochemical production [method
that]{.mark} [could produce 600 kilograms]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} carbon [[nanotubes]{.underline} **[per
day]{.underline}**]{.mark} [at a projected cost of around \$10 a
kilogram]{.underline}, or \$10,000 a metric ton.39 This will do for
carbon nanotubes what the Hall-Héroult process did for aluminum.
**[[Nanotubes]{.mark} [will become the]{.mark} universal [raw material
of choice]{.mark}]{.underline}**, displacing steel, aluminum, copper and
other metals and materials. Steel presently costs about \$750 per metric
ton. Nanotubes of equivalent strength to a metric ton of steel would
cost \$100 if this Cambridge process (or others being pursued in
research labs around the world) proves successful. Ben Wang, director of
Florida State's High Performance Materials Institute claims that: "[If
you take just one gram of nanotubes,]{.underline} and you unfold every
tube into a graphite sheet, [you can cover about two-thirds of a
football field]{.underline}".40 Since other research has indicated that
[carbon [nanotubes would]{.mark}]{.underline} [[be more suitable than
silicon for]{.mark} producing]{.underline}
**[[p]{.underline}]{.mark}**hoto**[[v]{.underline}]{.mark}**oltaic
[energy,]{.underline} consider the implications. [Several
grams]{.underline} of this material [could be the]{.underline}
[energy-producing skin for new generations of superlight
dirigibles]{.underline}---making these airships energy autonomous. [They
could replace airplanes]{.underline} as the primary means to transport
air freight. Modern American history has shown that anything human
beings decide they want done can be done in 20 years if it does not
violate the laws of nature. The atom bomb was developed in four years;
putting a man on the moon took eight years. It is a reasonable
conjecture that **[[by]{.mark} [2020]{.mark} or earlier]{.underline}**,
**[[a]{.mark}n industrial [process for]{.mark} the [inexpensive]{.mark}
production of carbon [nanotubes will be]{.mark}
[developed]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and that this would be the key to
solving our energy, raw materials, and environmental problems all at
once. Mitigating Anthropic Greenhouse Gases Another vital component of a
"no limits to growth" world is to formulate a rational environmental
policy that saves money; one that would gain wide grassroots support
because it would benefit taxpayers and businesses, and would not
endanger livelihoods. For example, what do sewage treatment, garbage
disposal, and fuel costs amount to as a percentage of municipal budgets?
What are the costs of waste disposal and fuel costs in stockyards, on
poultry farms, throughout the food processing industry, and in
restaurants? How much aggregate energy could be saved from all of the
above? Some experts claim that we could obtain enough liquid fuel from
recycling these hydrocarbon resources to satisfy all the transportation
needs of the United States. [Turning]{.underline} the above [waste into
energy by various means would be a huge cost saver and value generator,
in addition to being a blessing to the environment.]{.underline}
[The]{.underline} U.S. [army has developed a portable field apparatus
that turns]{.underline} a combat unit's [human waste and garbage into
bio-diesel to fuel their vehicles and generators]{.underline}.41 It is
called TGER---the Tactical Garbage to Energy Refinery. [It eliminates
the need to transport fuel to the field]{.underline}, thus saving lives,
time, and equipment expenses. The cost per barrel must still be very
high. However, [the history of military technology being civilianized
and revolutionizing accepted norms is long]{.underline}. We might expect
that **[within 5-10 years]{.underline}**, [economically competitive
units using similar technologies will appear in restaurants, on farms,
and perhaps even in individual households]{.underline}, turning organic
waste into usable and economical fuel. We might conjecture that [within
several decades]{.underline}, [centralized sewage disposal and garbage
collection will be things of the past and that]{.underline} even [the
Edison Grid]{.underline} (unchanged for over one hundred years) **[will
be deconstructed]{.underline}**. The Promise of Algae [Biofuels produced
from [algae could]{.mark} eventually [provide]{.mark} a substantial
portion of [our transportation fuel]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[[Algae]{.mark} has a much higher productivity potential than crop-based
biofuels because it [grows faster, uses less land and requires only
sun]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[CO2]{.mark} [plus]{.mark}]{.underline}
nutrients that can be provided from gray [[sewage]{.mark}
water]{.underline}. It is the primo CO2 sequesterer because it works for
free (by way of photosynthesis), and in doing so produces biodiesel and
ethanol in much higher volumes per acre than corn or other crops.
Production costs are the biggest remaining challenge. One Defense
Department estimate pins them at more than \$20 a gallon.42 But [once
commercialized in industrial scale facilities, production cost could go
as low as \$2 a gallon (the equivalent of \$88 per barrel of
oil]{.underline}) according to Jennifer Holmgren, director of renewable
fuels at an energy subsidiary of Honeywell International.43 Since algae
uses waste water and CO2 as its primary feedstock, its use to produce
transportation fuel or feedstock for product would actually improve the
environment. The Promise of the Electric Car There are 250 million cars
in the United States. Let's assume that they were all fully electric
vehicles (EVs) equipped with 25-kWh batteries. Each kWh takes a car two
to three miles, and if the average driver charges the car twice a week,
this would come to about 100 charge cycles per year. All told, Americans
would use 600 billion kWh per year, which is only 15% of the current
total U.S. production of 4 trillion kWh per year. If supplied during low
demand times, this would not even require additional power plants[. If
cars were made primarily out of Buckypaper, one kWh might take a car
40-50 miles.]{.underline} [If the surface of the car was utilized as a
photovoltaic, the car of the future might conceivably become **energy
autonomous**]{.underline} (or at least semi-autonomous). A kWh produced
by a coal-fired power plant creates two pounds of CO2, so our
car-related CO2 footprint would be 1.2 trillion pounds if all
electricity were produced by coal. However, burning one gallon of gas
produces 20 pounds of CO2.44 In 2008, the U.S. used 3.3 billion barrels
of gasoline, thereby creating about 3 trillion pounds of CO2. Therefore,
a switch to electric vehicles would cut CO2 emissions by 60% (from 3
trillion to 1.2 trillion pounds), even if we burned coal exclusively to
generate that power. Actually, replacing a gas car with an electric car
will cause zero increase in electric draw because refineries use seven
kWh of power to refine crude oil into a gallon of gasoline. A Tesla
Roadster can go 25 miles on that 7 KWh of power. So the electric car can
go 25 miles using the same electricity needed to refine the gallon of
gas that a combustion engine car would use to go the same distance.
Additional Strategies The goal of mitigating global warming/climate
change without changing our lifestyles is not naïve. Using proven
Israeli expertise, [[planting forests]{.mark} [on]{.mark} **just
[12%]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the world's [semi-arid areas would
offset]{.mark} the annual CO2 output of **[one thousand]{.mark}
500-megawatt [coal plants]{.mark}**]{.underline} (a gigaton a year).45 A
[global program]{.underline} of foresting 60% of the world's semi-arid
areas **[would offset five thousand 500-megawatt coal
plants]{.underline}** (five gigatons a year). Since mitigation goals for
global warming include reducing our CO2 emissions by eight gigatons by
2050, [this project alone would have a tremendous ameliorating
effect]{.underline}. Given that large swaths of semi-arid land areas
contain or border on some of the poorest populations on the planet, [[we
could put millions]{.mark} of the world's poorest citizens [to
work]{.mark} in forestation, thus]{.underline} accomplishing two
positives ([fighting poverty and environmental degradation) with one
project]{.underline}. [[Moving]{.mark} agriculture from its current
fieldbased paradigm [to vertical]{.mark} urban
[ag]{.mark}riculture]{.underline} [[would eliminate]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[two gigatons of CO2.]{.underline}** The [subsequent
re-wilding]{.underline} of vast areas of the earth's surface
[could]{.underline} help [sequester]{.underline} up to **[[50 gigatons
of CO2 a year]{.underline}]{.mark}**, completely reversing the trend.
The revolution underway in material science will help us to become
"self-sufficient" in energy. It will also enable us to create superlight
vehicles and structures that will produce their own energy. [Over time,
carbon nanotubes will replace steel, copper and aluminum in a myriad of
functions.]{.underline} [Converting waste to energy will eliminate most
of the methane gas humanity releases into the atmosphere]{.underline}.
Meanwhile, [artificial photosynthesis will suck CO2 out of the air at
1,000 times the rate of natural photosynthesis.]{.underline}46 [This
trapped CO2 could then be combined with hydrogen to create much of the
petroleum we will continue to need]{.underline}. [As hemp and other
fast-growing plants replace wood]{.underline} for making paper, [the
logging industry will largely cease to exist.]{.underline}
[Self-contained [fish farms will]{.mark} [provide]{.mark} a major share
of our [protein]{.mark} needs]{.underline} [[with]{.mark} far
[less]{.mark}]{.underline} environmental [[damage to]{.mark} the
[oceans]{.mark}.]{.underline} Population Explosion or Population
Implosion One constant refrain of anti-growth advocates is that we are
heading towards 12 billion people by the end of the century, that this
is unsustainable, and thus that we must proactively reduce the human
population to 3 billion-4 billion in order to "save the planet" and
human civilization from catastrophe. But [recent data indicates that a
**demographic winter** will engulf humanity by the middle of this
century.]{.underline} [[More than 60]{.mark}
[countries]{.mark}]{.underline} (containing over half the world's
population) [already [do not have replacement birth
rates]{.mark}]{.underline} of 2.1 children per woman. This includes the
entire EU, China, Russia, and half a dozen Muslim countries, including
Turkey, Algeria, and Iran. [[If]{.mark} present [trends
continue]{.mark}, India, Mexico and Indonesia will join this group
before 2030]{.underline}. [The human population will peak at
9]{.underline}-10 [billion by 2060]{.underline}, after which, for the
first time since the Black Death, it will begin to shrink[. [By the end
of the century, the]{.mark} human [population]{.mark} [might be]{.mark}
as low as [6 billion]{.mark}-7 billion.]{.underline} The real danger is
not a population explosion; but the consequences of the impending
population implosion.47 [This demographic process is]{.underline} [not
being driven by]{.underline} famine or disease as has been the case in
all previous history. Instead, it is being driven by the greatest
Cultural Revolution in the history of the human race: the **[liberation
and empowerment of women]{.underline}**. The fact is that [even with
**present technology**]{.underline}, [we would still be able to sustain
a global population of 12 billion by the end of the century if
needed.]{.underline} The evidence for this is cited above.

**[Why? Because markets humanize our trading partners. Trade requires us

create win-win transactions. You're less likely to want to go to war
with a country if you've spent time with its people than if you only see
it as lines on a map.]{.underline}**

Markets Make Us Value Human Life More

In The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined, Steven
**[Pinker notes that violence has been declining for centuries. This is
true in every category]{.underline}**, from murders to hate crimes to
child abuse. **[One factor behind the decline is the spread of commerce.
We have become conditioned to trade with others to get what we want. As
a result, strangers "switch from being targets of demonization and
dehumanization to partners in reciprocal altruism."]{.underline}**

**[Another factor is the rise in living standards that capitalism has
enabled]{.underline}**. In the United States, for instance, **[life
expectancy has risen from 39.4 years in 1880 to 78.7 years in 2011. This
change wasn't inevitable; until the 19th century, life expectancy
fluctuated from 30 to 40 years. Only since the Industrial Revolution has
life expectancy climbed steadily.]{.underline}**

**[Due to market-fueled innovations and new technologies, living
standards have increased dramatically since the Industrial Revolution.
Kids survive childhood, and shorter working hours mean that families can
be closer-knit.]{.underline}**

**[All of this makes people see their own lives as more valuable. This
decreases their willingness to potentially throw their life away in
crime, violence, or war. That's one reason we see less violence in
wealthier countries --- and thanks to markets, we're all a lot wealthier
than our ancestors]{.underline}**.

find this at work, one should not look to wealthy countries, but to
countries that have long shunned the market economy.

#### Breaking down neoliberalism kills [leadership]{.underline} 

**Duménil and Lévy 09**

\[Gérard Duménil and Dominique Lévy, Directors of Research at the Centre
National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris, The Crisis of
Neoliberalism and U.S. Hegemony, 2009,
<http://www.beigewum.at/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009_2_006-13.pdf>\]

[Beginning the historical investigation at the]{.underline} end of the
19th and [early 20th centuries in the United States,]{.underline}
[neoliberalism appears]{.underline} as the third such »social order«.
[[A]{.mark} first [**financial hegemony** prevailed]{.mark}]{.underline}
from the beginning of the century, [[but]{.mark} it [was **destabilized
during the Great Depression**]{.mark}]{.underline} and the New Deal, [[a
period of intense class struggle]{.mark}.]{.underline} The social order
characteristic of the period that stretches from the New Deal to the
late 1980s can be denoted as »social democratic« or »Keynesian«, with
significant differences among countries. Its main social feature was a
»compromise« between managerial and popular classes, paralleling the
containment of capitalist interests. How [[neoliberalism]{.mark} [was
established historically]{.mark}]{.underline} lies beyond the limits of
the present study. Conversely, the description of the methods used is
rather straightforward. A new discipline was imposed on workers, with
the control of their purchasing power, new labor conditions, and the
decline of welfare. While, after World War II, a large percentage of
profits were conserved within nonfinancial corporations to the end of
investment, in neoliberalism, [[profits]{.mark} were lavishly
[distributed]{.mark} as dividends [and]{.mark}, up to 2000s, a large
fraction was [paid out as interest]{.mark}]{.underline}. Policies aiming
at price stability were substituted for macro policies tending to growth
and employment[. [Financial regulations]{.mark} inherited [from
the]{.mark} Great [Depression were]{.mark} gradually
[lifted]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Restrictions to]{.mark} international
[trade]{.mark} were [eliminated]{.mark}]{.underline} [to the benefit of
free trade]{.underline}, [and the free international mobility of capital
was imposed to most countries]{.underline}. Neoliberal globalization
allowed for the deployment of transnational corporations worldwide.
[[The]{.mark} [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[emerged]{.underline}]{.mark} from the two world wars [[as the
**leading international power**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [While other
imperialist countries]{.underline}, as France or the United Kingdom,
[were still involved in the defense of their traditional empire, [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [abandoned]{.mark}]{.underline} the first
attempts at the constitutions of such an [[empire]{.underline}]{.mark}
at the end of the 19th century, [[to the benefit of]{.underline}]{.mark}
the Wilsonian vision of the informal **[[dominance of]{.mark} the most
advanced among [capitalist countries]{.mark}]{.underline}**, with the
gradual imposition of the dollar as international currency. The Great
Depression did not destabilize this hegemony, which was dramatically
consolidated by the victorious participation of the country in World War
II. The United States never accepted the new rules of the Bretton Woods
agreements limiting international trade and the international movements
of capital, and the dollar was confirmed as a substitute for a truly
international currency. After World War II, [[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[fought
for]{.mark}]{.underline} the defense, in front of the Soviet Union, of
the so-called »free world« and for [their own [dominance]{.mark}
worldwide]{.underline}. Everywhere, corruption, subversion, and wars
were used to these ends. [[The U.S. economy]{.mark} [came to dominate
the]{.mark}]{.underline} nonfinancial and financial [[world]{.mark}
economy.]{.underline} [The [transnational corporations]{.mark} of the
country [were the most powerful]{.mark}, in particular financial
institutions.]{.underline} In the 1970s, many analysts of global trends
pointed, however, to a decline of U.S. hegemony and the formation of a
»triad« (the United States, Europe, and Japan).
[[Neoliberalism]{.underline}]{.mark} inverted these trends and
**[[strengthened the]{.mark} [preeminence of the U.S.
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As of the 2000s, [[the U.S. economy was
presented]{.mark} to other major capitalist countries [as a model to be
emulated, and **the U**]{.mark}**nited [S]{.mark}tates as [a leader to
be followed]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

  A core premise of deep [[engagement]{.underline}]{.mark} is that it
[[prevents]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[emergence of
a]{.underline}]{.mark} far more [[dangerous]{.underline}]{.mark} global
[[security environment]{.underline}]{.mark}. For one thing, as noted
above, [the United States' overseas presence gives it the leverage to
restrain partners from taking provocative action]{.underline}. Perhaps
more important, its core alliance commitments also deter states with
aspirations to regional hegemony from contemplating expansion and make
its partners more secure, reducing their incentive to adopt solutions to
their security problems that threaten others and thus stoke security
dilemmas. The contention that engaged U.S. power dampens the baleful
effects of anarchy is consistent with influential variants of realist
theory. Indeed, arguably the scariest portrayal of the war-prone world
that would emerge absent the "American Pacifier" is provided in the
works of John Mearsheimer, who forecasts dangerous multipolar regions
replete with security competition, arms races, nuclear proliferation and
associated preventive wartemptations, regional rivalries, and even runs
at regional hegemony and full-scale great power war. 72 How do
retrenchment advocates, the bulk of whom are realists, discount this
benefit? Their arguments are complicated, but two capture most of the
variation: (1) U.S. security guarantees are not necessary to prevent
dangerous rivalries and conflict in Eurasia; or (2) prevention of
rivalry and conflict in Eurasia is not a U.S. interest. Each response is
connected to a different theory or set of theories, which makes sense
given that the whole debate hinges on a complex future counterfactual
(what would happen to Eurasia's security setting if the United States
truly disengaged?). Although a certain answer is impossible, each of
these responses is nonetheless a weaker argument for retrenchment than
advocates acknowledge. The first response flows from defensive realism
as well as other international relations theories that discount the
conflict-generating potential of anarchy under contemporary conditions.
73 Defensive realists maintain that the high expected costs of
territorial conquest, defense dominance, and an array of policies and
practices that can be used credibly to signal benign intent, mean that
Eurasia's major states could manage regional multipolarity peacefully
without theAmerican pacifier. Retrenchment would be a bet on this
scholarship, particularly in regions where the kinds of stabilizers that
nonrealist theories point to---such as democratic governance or dense
institutional linkages---are either absent or weakly present. There are
three other major bodies of scholarship, however, that might give
decisionmakers pause before making this bet. First is regional
expertise. Needless to say, there is no consensus on the net security
effects of U.S. withdrawal. Regarding each region, there are optimists
and pessimists. Few experts expect a return of intense great power
competition in a post-American Europe, but many doubt European
governments will pay the political costs of increased EU defense
cooperation and the budgetary costs of increasing military outlays. 74
The result might be a [[Europe]{.mark} that [is incapable of securing
itself]{.mark} from various threats that could be destabilizing within
the region and beyond]{.underline} (e.g., a regional conflict akin to
the 1990s Balkan wars), lacks capacity for global security missions in
which U.S. leaders might want European participation, and is vulnerable
to the influence of outside rising powers. [What about the]{.underline}
[other parts of Eurasia where the United States has a substantial
military presence]{.underline}? [Regarding the Middle East]{.underline},
[the balance begins toswing toward pessimists concerned that states
currently backed by Washington]{.underline}--- notably [[Israel, Egypt,
and Saudi Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[might]{.underline}]{.mark}
[take actions upon U.S. retrenchment that would [intensify security
dilemmas]{.mark}]{.underline}. And concerning [East Asia,
pessimismregarding the region's prospects without the American pacifier
is pronounced.]{.underline} Arguably the principal concern expressed by
area experts is that [J[apan and South Korea are]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[likely to **obtain a nuclear capacity**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} increase their military commitments, which
could [[stoke a **destabilizing reaction from
China**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is notable that during the Cold War,
both South Korea and Taiwan moved to obtain a nuclear weapons capacity
and were only constrained from doing so by astill-engaged United States.
75 The second body of scholarship casting doubt on the bet on defensive
realism's sanguine portrayal is all of the research that undermines its
conception of state preferences. Defensive realism's optimism about what
would happen if the United States retrenched is very much dependent on
itsparticular---and highly restrictive---assumption about state
preferences; once we relax this assumption, then much of its basis for
optimism vanishes. Specifically, the prediction of post-American
tranquility throughout Eurasia rests on the assumption that security is
the only relevant state preference, with security defined narrowly in
terms of protection from violent external attacks on the homeland. Under
that assumption, the security problem is largely solved as soon as
offense and defense are clearly distinguishable, and offense is
extremely expensive relative to defense. Burgeoning [[research
across]{.mark} the social and other sciences]{.underline},
however,[undermines that]{.underline} core [assumption]{.underline}:
[[states have preferences]{.underline}]{.mark} not only for security but
also [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} [[prestige, status]{.mark},
and]{.underline} other aims, and they[engage in trade-offs]{.underline}
among the various objectives. 76 In addition, [they define
security]{.underline} not just in terms of territorial protection but
[in view of many and varied milieu goals]{.underline}. It follows that
[even states that are]{.underline} relatively [secure may]{.underline}
nevertheless [engage in]{.underline} highly [competitive
behavior]{.underline}. [[Empirical studies show that this
is]{.underline}]{.mark} indeed sometimes [[the
case]{.underline}.]{.mark} 77 In sum, a bet on a benign postretrenchment
Eurasia is a bet that leaders of major countries will never allow these
nonsecurity preferences to influence their strategic choices. To the
degree that these bodies of scholarly knowledge have predictive
leverage, [U.S. [retrenchment would result in a]{.mark}]{.underline}
significant [[deterioration in the security environment]{.mark}
in]{.underline} at least some of [the world's key regions]{.underline}.
We have already mentioned the third, even more alarming body of
scholarship. Offensive realism predicts that[the [withdrawal]{.mark} of
the American pacifier [will yield]{.mark}]{.underline} either [a
competitive regional multipolarity complete [with]{.mark} associated
insecurity, [ar]{.mark}ms racing, crisis instability, nuclear
proliferation[,]{.mark} and the like]{.underline}, or bids for regional
hegemony, which may be [[beyond the capacity of
local]{.underline}]{.mark} great [[powers to
contain]{.underline}]{.mark} (and which in any case would generate
intensely competitive behavior, possibly
[[including]{.mark}]{.underline} regional [great power
war]{.underline}).

### 2ac alt fails -- too abstract

**The alt will fail -- neoliberalism is over generalized and offers no
explanatory power**

**Barnett 5** (Clive, Faculty of Social Sciences, The Open University,
Geoforum 36, "The consolations of 'neoliberalism,'" p. 9-10, Ebsco)

[The blind-spot in theories of neoliberalism]{.underline}---whether
neo-Marxist and Foucauldian---[comes with trying to account for how
top-down initiatives 'take' in everyday situations]{.underline}. So
[perhaps [the best thing to do is to stop thinking of "neoliberalism" as
a coherent "hegemonic" project]{.mark} altogether]{.underline}. For all
its apparent critical force, the vocabulary of "neoliberalism" and
"neoliberalization" in fact provides a double consolation for leftist
academics: it supplies us with plentiful opportunities for unveiling the
real workings of hegemonic ideologies in a characteristic gesture of
revelation; and in so doing, it invites us to align our own professional
roles with the activities of various actors "out there", who are always
framed as engaging in resistance or contestation. The conceptualization
of "neoliberalism" as a "hegemonic" project does not need refining by
adding a splash of Foucault. [Perhaps [we should]{.mark} try to **[do
without the concept of "neoliberalism" altogether]{.mark}**, [because it
might]{.mark} actually [compound]{.mark} rather than aid in [the task of
figuring out how the world works and how it
changes]{.mark}]{.underline}. One reason for this is that, [between an
overly economistic derivation of political economy and an overly statist
rendition of governmentality, [stories about "neoliberalism"]{.mark}
manage to **[reduce]{.mark}** the understanding of [social relations to
a residual effect of hegemonic projects]{.mark} and/or governmental
programmes of rule]{.underline} (see Clarke, 2004a). [Stories about
"neoliberalism" pay little attention to the pro-active role of
socio-cultural processes in provoking changes in modes of governance,
policy, and regulation]{.underline}. Consider the example of the
restructuring of public services such as health care, education, and
criminal justice in the UK over the last two or three decades. This can
easily be thought of in terms of a ''hegemonic'' project of
"neoliberalization", and certainly one dimension of this process has
been a form of anti-statism that has rhetorically contrasted market
provision against the rigidities of the state. But in fact these ongoing
changes in the terms of public-policy debate involve a combination of
different factors that add up to a much more dispersed populist
reorientation in policy, politics, and culture. These factors include
changing consumer expectations, involving shifts in expectations towards
public entitlements which follow from the generalization of consumerism;
the decline of deference, involving shifts in conventions and
hierarchies of taste, trust, access, and expertise; and the refusals of
the subordinated, refer- ring to the emergence of anti-paternalist
attitudes found in, for example, women's health movements or
anti-psychiatry movements. They include also the development of the
politics of difference, involving the emergence of discourses of
institutional discrimination based on gender, sexuality, race, and
disability. This has disrupted the ways in which welfare agencies think
about inequality, helping to generate the emergence of contested
inequalities, in which policies aimed at addressing inequalities of
class and income develop an ever more expansive dynamic of expectation
that public services should address other kinds of inequality as well
(see Clarke, 2004b). [None of these]{.underline} populist [tendencies is
simply an expression of a singular "hegemonic" project of
"neoliberalization".]{.underline} [They are effects of much longer
rhythms of socio-cultural change that emanate from the
bottom-up]{.underline}. [It seems just as plausible to suppose
that]{.underline} [[what we have come to recognise as]{.mark} "hegemonic
[neoliberalism" is a **muddled** set of **ad hoc, opportunistic
accommodations** to]{.mark} these [unstable dynamics of social
change]{.mark} as it is to think of it as the outcome of highly coherent
political-ideological projects]{.underline}. Processes of privatization,
market liberalization, and de-regulation have often followed an ironic
pattern in so far as they have been triggered by citizens' movements
arguing from the left of the political spectrum against the rigidities
of statist forms of social policy and welfare provision in the name of
greater autonomy, equality, and participation (e.g. Horwitz, 1989). [The
[political re-alignments]{.mark} of the last three or four decades
**[cannot]{.mark}**]{.underline} therefore [[**be adequately
understood** in terms of]{.mark} [a straightforward shift from the left
to the right]{.mark}, from values of collectivism to values of
individualism, or as a re-imposition of class power]{.underline}. [[The
emergence]{.mark} and generalization [of this]{.mark} populist ethos has
much longer, deeper, [and wider roots than those ascribed to]{.mark}
"hegemonic [neoliberalism]{.mark}"]{.underline}. And it also points
towards the extent to which easily the most widely resonant political
rationality in the world today is not right-wing market liberalism at
all, but is, rather, the polyvalent discourse of ''democracy'' (see
Barnett and Low, 2004).

### 2ac no alt

**The alt lacks a realistic alternative**

**Jones 11**

Owen, Masters at Oxford, named one of the Daily Telegraph\'s \'Top 100
Most Influential People on the Left\' for 2011, author of \"Chavs: The
Demonization of the Working Class\", The Independent, UK, \"Owen Jones:
Protest without politics will change nothing\", 2011,
[www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/owen-jones-protest-without-politics-will-change-nothing-2373612.html](http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/owen-jones-protest-without-politics-will-change-nothing-2373612.html)

My first experience of police kettling was aged 16. It was May Day 2001,
and the anti-globalisation movement was at its peak. The
turn-of-the-century anti-capitalist movement feels largely forgotten
today, but it was a big deal at the time. To a left-wing teenager
growing up in an age of unchallenged neo-liberal triumphalism, just to
have \"anti-capitalism\" flash up in the headlines was thrilling.
Thousands of apparently unstoppable protesters chased the world\'s
rulers from IMF to World Bank summits -- from Seattle to Prague to Genoa
-- and the authorities were rattled. [Today, as protesters in nearly a
thousand cities across the world follow the example set by]{.underline}
the [Occupy]{.underline} Wall Street protests, [it\'s worth pondering
what happened to [the anti-globalisation movement]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Its [activists did not lack passion or determination. But they [**did
lack a coherent alternative to the neo-liberal project.** With no
clear]{.mark} political [direction, the movement was easily swept away
by]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[jingoism and turmoil that followed
9/11]{.mark},]{.underline} just two months after Genoa. Don\'t get me
wrong: the Occupy movement is a glimmer of sanity amid today\'s economic
madness. By descending on the West\'s financial epicentres, it reminds
us of how a crisis caused by the banks (a sentence that needs to be
repeated until it becomes a cliché) has been cynically transformed into
a crisis of public spending. The founding statement of Occupy London
puts it succinctly: \"We refuse to pay for the banks\' crisis.\" The
Occupiers direct their fire at the top 1 per cent, and rightly so -- as
US billionaire Warren Buffett confessed: \"There\'s class warfare, all
right, but it\'s my class, the rich class, that\'s making war, and
we\'re winning.\" The Occupy movement has provoked fury from senior US
Republicans such as Presidential contender Herman Cain who --
predictably -- labelled it \"anti-American\". They\'re right to be
worried: those camping outside banks threaten to refocus attention on
the real villains, and to act as a catalyst for wider dissent. [But [a
coherent alternative]{.mark} to the tottering global economic order
[remains]{.mark}, it seems, [as distant as ever]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Neo-liberalism crashes around, half-dead, with no-one to administer the
killer blow. There\'s always a presumption that a crisis of capitalism
is good news for the left. Yet in the Great Depression, fascism consumed
much of Europe. The economic crisis of the 1970s did lead to a
resurgence of radicalism on both left and right. But, spearheaded by
Thatcherism and Reaganism, the New Right definitively crushed its
opposition in the 1980s.This time round, there doesn\'t even seem to be
an alternative for the right to defeat. That\'s not the fault of the
protesters. In truth, the left has never recovered from being virtually
smothered out of existence. It was the victim of a perfect storm: the
rise of the New Right; neo-liberal globalisation; and the repeated
defeats suffered by the trade union movement. But, above all, it was the
aftermath of the collapse of Communism that did for the left. As US
neo-conservative Midge Decter triumphantly put it: \"It\'s time to say:
We\'ve won. Goodbye.\" From the British Labour Party to the African
National Congress, left-wing movements across the world hurtled to the
right in an almost synchronised fashion. It was as though the left wing
of the global political spectrum had been sliced off. That\'s why,
[[although we live in an age of revolt, there remains no left to give it
direction]{.mark} and purpose.]{.underline}

**[As a provocative minority and plural community, [degrowth would die
in internal conflicts and face political irrelevance if it were to
present]{.mark}]{.underline}** a full political proposal by setting out
a coherent and complete set of policies for a new society. While
degrowth may inspire a "new left" alternative to the extractivist and
growth-led model of recent Latin American left government experiences,
the construction of **[[a fully-fledged
alternative]{.underline}]{.mark}** or the political agenda of a minority
party should not be the priority. Instead, degrowth should speak to
existing political forces and engage with policies that can be
implemented by existing governments (at various scales). Working within
existing institutions The degrowth community should work to challenge
and change social norms, particularly in terms of growth as social
objective. More importantly, however, it should engage with existing
institutions. **[Imagining new institutions for a degrowth society is an
important thought-exercise, but [building new institutions]{.mark}
[takes enormous efforts]{.mark}. At the same time, [there is no
guarantee that new institutions would be]{.mark} more democratic and
[better than]{.mark} the [old ones, because institutions are the result
of long]{.mark}, non-linear [and complex
processes]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Moreover we need to start working
right now. Therefore, we need to work within the existing institutions
of society, towards incremental pragmatic policy changes.

### 2ac econ rationality

#### Economic rationality is a useful heuristic

**Arena 13**

Phil Arena (assistant professor of political science at the University
at Buffalo, SUNY). "In Defense of Homo Economicus." Duck of Minerva.
March 14^th^, 2013.
http://duckofminerva.com/2013/03/in-defense-of-homo-economicus.html

[[I don't think human behavior is identical to]{.mark} that of [Homo
Economicus]{.mark}. Neither does anyone else. But one could argue that
the degree of similarity between human behavior and that expected from
Homo Economicus rates about a 6 out of 10]{.underline}. I won't call
that something it's not --- simple theoretical models based on
unrealistic assumptions do not achieve perfect explanatory power.\* But
if your goal is to see how far you can get with a model simple enough to
allow you to be very confident that your conclusions actually follow
from your assumptions, you can do worse than we've done by focusing on
Homo Economicus. What makes me say we've achieved a 6? Well, there's
obviously room for disagreement here. I wouldn't argue too much with
someone who thinks that 5 would be more accurate. [[But the only way to
say that there is minimal similarity]{.mark} between human behavior and
that expected from Homo Economicus [is to **ignore**]{.mark} **the
[available evidence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Consider, for example, one
of the most influential papers demonstrating the failures of Homo
Economicus. In no uncertain terms, the authors inform us that the
predictions of the Ultimatum game are not born out any of the 15 small
scale societies they studied. But how far removed from reality are the
predictions of this model? When I first describe this game to my
students, I ask them what they expect the results to be. A large number
of them tell me that they expect most people to propose equitable
divisions --- to propose half of the money. And some people do just
that. In some societies, such behavior is even typical, at least
according to these experiments. But it's not in most of the societies
the authors studied. The following table gives the mean offers for each
of the 15 societies the authors studied (click to enlarge). giving In
almost every society, the person designated as the proposer offers less
than half of the money, contrary to many people's intuitions. And that's
with face to face experiments. One study of the closely related Dictator
game (where the receiver doesn't have to approve the division) found
just under half the participants giving away least \$3 of a \$10 pie
under normal experimental conditions, but only 15% under anonymity.
[Perhaps more striking, [if you give people the choice between dividing
\$10 between themselves and another person or taking \$9 without
anyone]{.mark} ever [getting designated as a potential recipient, a good
number take the \$9.]{.mark}]{.underline} That's not what Homo
Economicus would do, which would be to play the Dictator game and keep
all \$10. But it sure as heck ain't altruism or a concern for fairness
or anything like that. Moreover, if you but offer people the option to
take instead of give, most will take. They don't take everything, a Homo
Economicus would, but the fact that they take at all is quite telling.
As Levitt and List forcefully argue, much of the putatively pro-social
behavior we've discovered through laboratory experiments appears to be
an artifact of the laboratory setting. We haven't learned that people
aren't selfish --- we've learned that they don't want people to think
that they're selfish. When people play the Trust Game, they usually
transfer about half the pile of money, and receive about half of what
becomes a larger pile back. This seems to indicate that people are happy
to take advantage of opportunities for mutual gain by lending money to
those who will use it productively because they trust that they will
receive back more than they loaned out. Great! So why do we have banks,
and why is it necessary for the federal government to backstop those
banks through the FDIC? Where's all the trust? The spontaneous
cooperation with total strangers in the absence of legal institutions
protecting them against exploitation? Again, no one is arguing that Homo
Economicus is anything but a mythical creature. Real people are not so
narrowly self-interested. But the behavior we observe in the real world
bears more than a little resemblance to what we'd expect from Homo
Economicus. Reasonable people can disagree about how much complication
we should accept in pursuit of greater explanatory power. I myself
choose different assumptions for different projects, sometimes accepting
more complication and sometimes keeping things more simple. [[I'm not
trying to say that we should always assume]{.mark} that [human behavior
is similar]{.mark} to that of Homo Economicus. What I'm saying is that
**[it can be useful, at times, to do so.]{.mark}**]{.underline} That
it's pretty amazing that we can reproduce trade winds, storm systems,
and the Gulf Stream with a dishpan, a turntable, and a Bunsen
Burner.\*\*

### 2ac inevitable

**Neoliberalism inevitable -- elites shut down opposition**

**Vakulabharanam 12**

\[Vamsi Vakulabharanam, faculty member with the School of Economics at
the University of Hyderabad, India., Why Does Neoliberalism Persist Even
After the Global Crisis?, 12/20/12,
<http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/12/why-does-neoliberalism-persist-even-after-the-global-crisis.html>\]

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} [2007-9 [crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} in
global capitalism [[brought]{.mark} a new [energy]{.mark}]{.underline}
and focus to the heterodox economists, and more broadly [[to]{.mark} the
[critics]{.mark} of neoliberalism]{.underline} from different arenas of
society. It seemed clear at that time that neoliberalism had run its
course when it met its structural contradiction -- with the burst of the
US housing bubble and the concomitant financial crises across the world,
it looked like the avenues through which demand was being generated were
closed and the system was poised for structural change. [Three years
later]{.underline}, Southern Europe is witnessing an intense so-called
sovereign debt crisis with the working people bearing the brunt of it,
and real economies in the developed world are continuing to witness slow
growth. [The US seems]{.underline} [to be under the threat of
the]{.underline} so-called [fiscal cliff (]{.underline}which seems more
like a political event rather than an economic one). The
[economies]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [grew quickly during the
neo-liberal period, like China and India]{.underline}, [have slowed
down]{.underline} considerably. Across the globe, we seem to be going
through a period of uncertainty without a clear path ahead. **[[Yet,
neoliberalism persists]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Why? There are multiple
explanations for this. [[Bailout packages]{.underline}]{.mark} of
various governments were directed at rescuing financial capital, and
this has [[pitted]{.underline}]{.mark} the interests of [financial
[capital]{.mark} [against the]{.mark} interests of the
[majority]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} global **[left has not
been strong enough]{.mark} [to take advantage of the
crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline} to better represent the interests of the
majority. [Governments across the world]{.underline}, after a brief gap,
[have returned to their neoliberal posture]{.underline} of supporting
financial capital and so forth. There is truth in all these
explanations. However, we need to broaden the array of explanations both
to take into account the spatial diversity of neoliberalism, as well as
to deepen our analytical understanding of this persistence. I offer one
such explanation from field explorations in India to add to the existing
explanations. This addition is not simply academic, but it shows the
need for deeper political engagement to bring about systemic change,
given that our explanations of the structural contradictions of
neoliberalism are on the mark. In two recent field visits that we (a
group of local researchers) undertook to understand the persistence of
neoliberalism at the concrete level, we found some interesting
phenomena. Both these visits were in the state of Andhra Pradesh in
South India. The first visit was in the region of Telangana, which is
highly politicized right now, as the people of the region are fighting
for a separate state within the Indian nation-state. The second visit
was to a tribal habitat in the northeastern region of the same state,
where communist struggles have been active for a while. In both these
areas, there are continued appropriations of common lands, common
resources and minerals, such as Granite and Bauxite by local and foreign
capitalist elites aided by the State. In the process, these elites are
destroying the local livelihoods without creating credible alternative.
Both these are classic cases of primitive accumulation or accumulation
by dispossession, a process that has centrally defined neoliberalism
over the last thirty-five years across the globe. [Accumulation by
dispossession]{.underline} operates in our times through the following
modes of appropriation. First, it [operates through the acquisition of
lands from small producers]{.underline} such as peasants, tribal people,
artisans and the urban poor in the name of Special Economic Zones and
the like. Some of the lands acquired thus, have became open to
speculative enterprises of real estate dealers. Second, [there has been
a large-scale privatization drive in most countries that has made public
sector enterprises alienate their properties at throwaway prices to
private players]{.underline}. Third, and these are the cases that we
have focused on -- [commons have been appropriated with
ease]{.underline} either [because the laws governing them are weak or
because common properties are often meddled with by the
State]{.underline}. What we found in these two regions is that the
particular modes of appropriation that have come into being with great
force during the neoliberal period have persisted even after the crisis.
Why is this the case? One explanation that ties in with the explanations
above is that resistance has not been strong enough or effective from
the people and their social movements or from the larger left movements.
The other explanation that we offered is [that [neoliberalism]{.mark}
has been able to [create]{.mark} [structures of populism that are
**deeply entrenched**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The local [[elites]{.mark}
have pursued a three-fold strategy for the continued appropriation of
the commons]{.underline}. First, [they]{.underline} (with the support of
the State) [have put in [place]{.mark} various [populist policy]{.mark}
[imperatives]{.mark}]{.underline} [[that]{.mark} have temporarily
[addressed]{.mark} the consumption [needs of the
majority]{.mark}]{.underline} without altering the deeper neoliberal
structural forces that have inhibited employment growth and wage growth
over the last thirty years. For example, there are schemes such as
housing or subsidized food for the poor even as their productive
resources such as land are acquired by the elites/states. These have
tended to perpetuate themselves after the global crisis, even with the
loud demands for austerity. Second, [the elites have [continued to
appropriate]{.mark} common and public [resources to keep their own
accumulation]{.mark} levels [above an acceptable minimum]{.mark} in a
time of slowdown of accumulation opportunities [through]{.mark} regular
[economic growth.]{.mark}]{.underline} Resistance is sought to be
controlled through populism of the kind discussed above. Even in regions
that are highly politicized, such as Telangana, the leadership of the
movement has been hand-in-glove with the local elites who gain
consistently through the perpetuation of these appropriation
practices.Third, [professionals and [middle classes have]{.mark} [been
the beneficiaries of a system that has thrived on the]{.mark} creation
of [enclave economies]{.mark}]{.underline} [where there is a sharing of
rents among the elites and these professional group]{.underline}s. These
professional classes have taken up key positions in the government,
media, corporate executive roles, and as intermediaries between the
elites and the working people who use the commons. The [**[broad support
of]{.mark} these [classes ]{.mark}**[for]{.mark} the [local
elites]{.mark} [has]{.mark} [played a **key**]{.mark} **role [in the
perpetuation of neoliberalism]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As long as these
processes persist, [[neoliberalism will be strong]{.mark} on the ground,
[with]{.mark} the **[elites and non-elites bound together]{.mark}** in
the larger neoliberal system through the different]{.underline}, yet
entangled processes of appropriation, rent sharing and populism. Of
course, this cannot go on, since the logic of austerity is bound to
create contradictions in the path of populism. However, this
contradiction may unfold very differently across space and time, as not
all governments are going to react identically to the demands of
austerity. The 1% in the US (that the Occupy movement has targeted) or
the top decile of the population (in countries like China and India)
continue to benefit from the perpetuation of the neoliberal
configuration while they are pitted against their large majorities. As
long as the political groups on the ground do not make their voices
heard loudly enough against the top 1% or the top 10%, and [[as long as
there]{.mark} [are]{.mark} continued [benefits]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the

With this sort of example as inspiration, one hopes that scholars of
neoliberal nature would take on Castree\'s task. Yet one can anticipate
refusals (and this pertains directly to Castree\'s two final questions,
about the effects of nature\'s neoliberalization and their evaluation).
Some will argue that \`neoliberalism\' is constituted of a range of
diverse, locally rooted practices, thereby justifying a sector-specific,
case-study approach for which attempts at terminological systematization
are of little utility. This is, as Castree notes, an evasion rather than
a convincing response. [A more compelling argument is that [the
biophysical characteristics of resources and associated resource
economies differ so greatly that expedience]{.mark} (and analytical
rigour) [demands a high degree of specialization.]{.mark} But the most
fundamental objection (and one that Castree overlooks) is that [the
chain of causality in the study of environmental impacts arising
from]{.mark} projects of [neolib]{.mark}eralization [is so attenuated,
and]{.mark} the [confounding variables so numerous]{.mark} (particularly
given the multiple scales of regulation and resource production
involved), [that **it is almost impossible to prove that the
environmental \`impacts\' we might identify do indeed arise from a
particular strategy identified as neoliberal.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

**Disregard their impact claims -- attributing consequence to
neoliberalism is [epistemologically asinine]{.underline}.**

**Castree 6** (Noel, Professor of Geography at the University of
Manchester, Environment and Planning A, volume 38, Issue 1, "From
neoliberalism to neoliberalisation: consolations, confusions, and
necessary illusions," p. 1-5)

Yet in the slow (but enjoyable) process of reviewing the literature I
have become increasingly confused as to the precise object of analytical
attention. It is not simply that the research papers I am reading focus
on different kinds of natural and altered environments (hardly
surprising given the world\'s biophysical diversity). In addition, the
political economic project driving environmental change --
'[[neoliberalism']{.underline}]{.mark} -- [[seems to alter its shape
from paper to paper]{.underline}]{.mark}. So, [although the]{.underline}
authors whose [essays]{.underline} and chapters I am reading appear to
[share a common analytical focus]{.underline} -- their different
environmental expertises notwithstanding [-- it turns out that this
focus is rather fuzzy]{.underline}. [This is not just an empirical
issue]{.underline}. [In theoretical terms]{.underline} [[what counts as
neoliberalism does not appear to be a matter of
consensus]{.underline}]{.mark} among critics in geography and cognate
fields. In some cases privatisation and marketisation are the key
criteria; in other cases additional features are listed among its
differentia specifica. Empirically, it is no surprise to discover that,
however defined, \`neoliberalism\' does not \`ground itself\' unchanged
from place to place. Rather, as the case studies I have been reading
show so well, its embedding in real-world situations muddies the clean
lines of its conceptual specification. So far so unexceptional. Anyone
with an even passing familiarity with geographical debates over previous
grand abstractions -- such as postmodernity, post-Fordism, or
globalization -- will doubtless interpret my \`fuzzy concept\' problem
as no problem at all. Given time, it might be thought that those
researchers whose empirical work I am surveying will sharpen theoretical
understandings of neoliberalism by carefully specifying different
modalities of \`actually existing neoliberalism\'. This being early
days, it might be thought that we still have some way to go before
research into the \`nature\' of neoliberalism reaches maturity.
\`Maturity\', from this perspective, would be a situation in which a
substantial body of evidence has both arisen from and altered
increasingly refined conceptualisations of what neoliberalism is all
about. As this involves increased theoretical complexity, then the
theoretical abstraction 'neoliberalism' will, over time, give way to
plural understandings of neoliberalisation as a really existing process
rather than an ageographical thing. The end result will be that
environmental geographers -- like other geographers interested in
neoliberalism -- will move from the heavens of abstract theory to the
nitty-gritty of empirical specifics ending up somewhere in between: with
mid-range conceptualisations that have genuine explanatory and normative
purchase. Though the above scenario is not implausible, I have nagging
doubts -- ones whose implications extend way beyond my immediate subject
of concern. My worry is that [[analysts of
neoliberalism]{.underline}]{.mark}\'s environmental impacts [[are
travelling down a **road to nowhere**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
potential dead end to which I refer is not a function of the topic being
researched -- like any political economic project, neoliberalism will
have nontrivial effects on the nonhuman world (and therefore on us). It
is essential that these effects be described, explained, and evaluated.
But the key question -- and the basis of my concern -- is what precisely
produces these effects. Ostensibly it is 'neoliberalism' of course. But
because geographical researchers of neoliberalism are rightly trying to
complicate and dehomogenise this thought-abstraction, the issue of what,
precisely, the object of analysis is arises. If, as Clive Barnett (2005,
page 9) states, \`\`There is no such thing as neoliberalism!\'\', then
we are forced to recognise one of two possibilities. The first --
apropos the mid-level theory mentioned above -- is that there are
distinct kinds of neoliberalisation whose environmental impacts can be
fairly accurately understood (even though there is unlikely to be a
consistent relationship between kinds and impacts). The second is that
even at this mesolevel neoliberalism can only exist as a
thought-abstraction not a \`real entity\' because 'it' only ever exists
in articulation with actors, institutions, and agendas that immediately
call into question whether a thing called 'neoliberalism' -- however
carefully specified -- can be held responsible for anything. Clearly, I
am touching here upon fundamental research issues -- those of ontology
and epistemology -- that cannot be resolved at a purely philosophical
level. To date, researchers of neoliberalism in urban and economic
geography have tended to resist the second possibility mentioned above
(perhaps because it appears to lead to the dead end of an idiographic
focus on the unique and the singular). Instead, they believe that
ongoing empirical research can be synthesised and compared so that
mid-level concepts will emerge. The likelihood is that the environmental
geographers whose research I have recently been reading will, similarly,
see the production of such grounded concepts as their long-term
objective. If so, I wish to give them pause for thought -- so too all
those other geographers undertaking theoretically informed and
theoretically relevant empirical research into neoliberalism\'s actually
existing forms. A brief exploration of some unresolved tensions in the
writings of Wendy Larner and Jamie Peck is instructive here. Economic
geographers both, Larner and Peck\'s overview pieces on neoliberalism
have enjoyed a wide readership among critical geographers (Larner, 2003;
Peck 2001; 2004; see also Peck and Tickell, 2002). Both authors have
tried to set agendas for current and future geographical research into
neoliberalism that touch upon the source of my concern in this
commentary. Larner (2003, page 510) has argued that [[neoliberalism
needs to be given \`\`an identity crisis\'\']{.underline}]{.mark}.
Following J K Gibson-Graham (1996) she argues that [[when critical
scholars reify neoliberalism as]{.mark} a [hegemonic]{.mark}, unified
entity [they]{.mark}, perversely, **[exaggerate its power]{.mark}**
despite their oppositional stance towards it]{.underline}. Her
recommendation is that we take aspatial and universal conceptions of
neoliberalism and render them geographical: that we pay attention to
\`\`the different variants of neoliberalism, to the hybrid nature of
contemporary policies and programmes\...\[and\] to the multiple and
contradictory aspects of neoliberal spaces, techniques, and subjects\'\'
(page 509, emphasis in the original). However, perhaps aware that this
argument can be seen to license the proliferation of disconnected case
studies, she also stresses \`\`the important contributions of academic
work focused on identifying the similarities between different forms of
neoliberalism\'\' (page 510). The hidden tensions in Larner\'s argument
become manifest in Peck\'s excellent synoptic essays on neoliberalism.
He notes that neoliberalism is a \`\`perplexingly amorphous political
economic phenomena\'\' (2004, page 394) because it remains unclear at
what geographical scales and levels of theoretical abstraction we can
identify it. As he puts it, \`\`While the neoliberal discourses and
strategies that are mobilized in \... different settings share certain
family resemblances, local institutional context clearly (and really)
matters in the style, substance, origins and outcomes \...\'\' (page
395). This is more than a reiteration of Larner\'s apparently sensible
attempt to give the grand abstraction \`neoliberalism\' an identity
crisis. More than Larner, Peck wants to identify commonalities within
apparent difference without succumbing to \`\`the fallacies of
monolithism \... or convergence thinking\'\' (page 403). As he
continues, \`\`While geographers tend to be rightly sceptical of
spatially totalizing claims, splitting differences over varieties of
neoliberalism cannot be an end in itself, not least because it begs
questions about the common roots and shared features of the unevenly
neoliberalized landscape that confronts us.\'\' What Peck seems to have
in mind here is not a process of pure thought abstraction: one in which
generic similarities among different neoliberalisms are identified
yielding a \`neoliberal model\' that nowhere exists as such. Instead, he
recognises that all neoliberalisations are hybrid from the outset
\["even the United States represents a 'case', rather than the model
itself\'" (page 393)\]. It follows for him, therefore, that "in the
absence of a more careful mapping of these hybrids-in-connection, [[the
concept of neoliberalism]{.underline}]{.mark} \...
[[remains]{.underline}]{.mark} seriously underspecified, [[little
more]{.underline}]{.mark} in some cases [[than a radical-theoretical
**slogan\'**]{.mark}**\'**]{.underline} (page 403). It seems to me that,
despite his best efforts, Peck fails to address satisfactorily some key
problems in the argument that both he and Larner are advancing. In a
sense both authors want to have their cake and eat it. They insist that
we identify different modalities of neoliberalism without giving up on
the task of discussing "the abstraction we might provisionally term
neoliberalism in general\'" (page 395) -- where the latter now arises
from a comparative consideration of empirical research rather than from
a priori thought-experiments or reference to the programmatic writings
of Friedman and Hayek. For my own part I see difficulties with this
\`both/and\' agenda even as I understand the intentions behind it. Let
me explain. First, part of neoliberalism\'s 'perplexing amorphousness'
-- whatever geographical scale or level of theoretical abstraction we
are dealing with -- stems from a fairly intractable inability to 'fix'
the term\'s meanings and real-world referents. Unlike, say, water --
which in one of its three states remains water wherever and whenever it
is -- neoliberalism does not possess stable characteristics. We only
'know' that a given phenomena is neoliberal -- or has "a more than
trivial degree of neoliberal content" (page 403) -- because we have
selected from among several definitions that other researchers or
real-world actors use to specify what neoliberalism is. Because these
definitions are multiple -- as I noted earlier, critics usually offer
between two and several criteria when defining what counts as a
neoliberal idea or policy -- then \`the real world\' can only partly
function as a 'court of appeal' to resolve competing claims as to what
is (or is not) neoliberal in degree and kind. Second, even if this were
not an issue, neoliberal practices always, as Larner and Peck rightly
argue, exist in a more-than-neoliberal context. The context matters
because it introduces difference, path dependency, and unevenness in
terms of process and outcome: neoliberalisations in the plural. But this
then begs the question: what does it mean to abstract from context
(again, whatever geographical scale or level of theoretical abstraction
we are dealing with) in the way that Larner and especially Peck
recommend? Even in Peck\'s subtle reading of 'neoliberalism in general'
we confront the possibility that we are simply listing generic -- albeit
historically specific -- characteristics found in multiple geographical
contexts. Because the effects of these characteristics can only ever be
understood contextually then the suspicion arises that
[[neoliberalism]{.underline}]{.mark} depicted over and above context [is
a pure archetype: something unreal that **[has no consequences or
existence in itself]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This, of course, raises the
key question of where context begins and where it ends. Phrased
differently, it raises the question of geographical scale: at what
socially constituted scale(s) does (do) discrete modes of neoliberal
policy and practice exist? The answer, as the growing empirical
literature shows, is that it very much depends. One of the reasons that
critics see neoliberalism as tendentially hegemonic is because it has
been \`rolled out\' by global institutions (such as the World Bank) with
the (apparent) power to impose their will on whole countries. But this
does not, of course, mean that it is implemented uniformly over space
because of preexisting differences in the configurations of state,
business, and civil society. What is more, national, regional, and local
level actors in various parts of the world have enacted their own
neoliberal policies in relation to specific sets of people, places,
natural resources, industries, and so on. So even if neoliberal ideas
have, these last twenty years, diffused out from globally powerful
bodies this does nothing to alter the fact of hybridity and variety that
Larner and Peck both discern. My third point, in light of this, is that
[[it is wrong to believe that 'larger' geographical
scales]{.underline}]{.mark} (for example, the North American Free Trade
Agreement area) [[constitute a more uniform neoliberal
landscape]{.underline}]{.mark} 'overlaying' more regionally and locally
variable ones. The point, surely, is that [[even global policies]{.mark}
and rules ['bite' differently all the way]{.mark} from the continental
[down]{.mark} to the local scales]{.underline}. In other words,
'difference' does not begin (or somehow \`deepen\') at the local scale
alone (as implied by Perreault and Martin, 2005). Neither Larner nor
Peck suggest that it does, but there is nonetheless the risk that their
arguments can be seen to imply that there is a scale or scales where
geographical difference ends and spatial similarity begins. As I
suggested in the previous paragraph, neoliberalism is 'impure' at all
geographical scales, meaning that the search for similarities can easily
become a formal rather than substantive exercise. The way to avoid this
last possibility is to do what critical realists in human geography have
been doing for years. Supposing that we can agree on what
neoliberalism\'s defining characteristics are, we start by recognising
that it exists in an overdetermined socionatural universe. We therefore
acknowledge that it never acts alone -- only in a fairy-tale world where
everything is privatised, marketised, and commodified would this not
hold true. Therefore, when we identify specific variants of
neoliberalism we are not examining varieties of a really existing,
homogenous genus. Instead, we are doing two things. First, we are seeing
how a really existing and quite widespread set of policy ideas are
having conjoint effects at specific geographical scales (up to and
including the global). In other words, we are examining contingently
occurring processes and outcomes that may well have operated differently
if the 'neoliberal component' had not been present. Second, this means
the object of analysis in any given research project is not a mere
temporary 'variant' of something more enduring and solid but rather a
qualitatively distinct phenomenon in its own right: namely, an
articulation between certain neoliberal policies and a raft of other
social and natural phenomena. Rigorously pursued, a critical realist
approach to neoliberalism or any other topic resists the 'violence of
abstraction': that is, the habit of confusing epistemic discussions
about a phenomenon abstracted from its contexts of operation with
ontological discussions about its actual behaviour and its material
effects. As the now-distant 'localities debate' showed, the best
critical realist research does not doubt that certain phenomena cover
wide spans of space and time. Instead, it insists that such phenomena
are likely to be impure at all scales and this impurity must be
respected not seen as a deviation from some norm or essence. How does
this relate to attempts to compare different variants of neoliberalism?
The answer is that critical realists would look for substantial (not
formal) similarities in causal processes and contingent similarities in
how those processes work out on the ground. In other words, geographical
difference matters to critical realists 'all the way down' which is not
the same as saying that the world is necessarily a patchwork of unlike
parts. Critical realists, though not discussed by Peck in his recent
work (though further back in time see Peck, 1996), would doubtless
approach neoliberalism in the way he recommends. They would identify
similarities between neoliberalisations not to suggest that the
differences can be bracketed but to suggest, instead, that even with
these differences substantial commonalities of process and outcome
occur. Equally, though, they would be open to the evidence telling them
a different story: one in which the differences make such a difference
that the commonalities exist only in name (conceptually) not in
actuality. In either case, it would be axiomatic that it is never
\`neoliberalism\' alone that causes anything, but always
'neoliberalism-plus' -- begging the empirical question of at one point
of 'impurity' it becomes impossible to use the term neoliberal in any
meaningful analytic sense. What is the relevance of all this to the
relatively new research literature exploring neoliberalisms and the
nonhuman world? In a recent critical review of work by Larner, Peck, and
other geographic analysts of neoliberalism, Barnett (2005, pages 9-10)
has made the following observation. "For all its apparent critical
force\'", he argues, "[[the vocabulary of
'neoliberalism']{.underline}]{.mark} and 'neoliberalization' in fact
provides a double consolation for leftist academics: it [[supplies us
with]{.underline}]{.mark} plentiful opportunities for unveiling the real
workings of hegemonic ideologies in a characteristic gesture of
revelation. In so doing, it invites us to align our own professional
roles with the activities of various actors 'out there', who are always
framed as engaging in resistance or contestation.\'\' If Barnett is
right (and I think he might be) then it is important that the
still-young geographical research literature on neoliberalism and nature
avoids the consolations to which he refers. In a recent theme issue of
this journal on neoliberalism in Latin America -- in which several
essays examine environmental impacts -- Thomas Perreault and Patricia
Martin (2005) seem drawn to these consolations despite themselves. On
the one side, like Larner and Peck, they deny that neoliberalism tout
court exists (only specific versions of it). Yet they also make plenary
claims about 'its\' implications for the environment and its governance
(page 193). What is the appeal of continuing to talk in terms of
**[[grand abstractions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, even as they are being
called into question? One answer is that the \`bad\' (that is, aspatial)
habits of social science thinking continue to affect geographical
thinking. As Barnett implies, [[academic critics]{.underline}]{.mark}
are made to [[**feel important** if the object of their animus
appears]{.underline}]{.mark} to be [hegemonic, global, and
[powerful]{.mark}]{.underline}: something that demands urgent critical
scrutiny. [[It is far less]{.underline}]{.mark} glamorous and [[\`sexy\'
to have]{.mark} constantly [to describe ones objects of analysis
as]{.mark} multiple, [complex]{.mark}, and varied through time and
space]{.underline}. As David Harvey (1985, page xi) argued many years
ago, spatiotemporal specificity appears to paralyse the generalising
impulses of mainstream and radical social scientists (like economists
and social theorists).

**Neoliberalism allows for individual rights and whistle blowing --
solves their VTL offense**

**Bjorkelo and Madsen 13**

Now, what have these suggested societal changes to do with the
individual act of whistleblowing? Quite a lot, as individual
responsibility in the workplace, and the chance of someone exercising
it, is not simply down to personal character, but as Power (2011) states
related to historical, social and political circumstances. Of particular
interest is what the 'workplace' actually has come to mean to
[[workers]{.underline}]{.mark}. Bourdieu (1998b) [[called neoliberalism
a political project]{.mark} [dedicated to the]{.mark} methodical
[destruction of collectives]{.mark}]{.underline}. He emphasised how
[[this presented a new]{.mark} kind of [economic responsibility]{.mark}
on agents.]{.underline} Bourdieu linked this tendency to the overall
neoliberal individualisation of working life where organisational
profits are turned into individual merit (through personal contracts and
salaries) and individual responsibility. Thus, workers cling to their
jobs and organisations under conditions of insecurity, suffering and
stress. On the other hand, [[neoliberalism can]{.underline}]{.mark} [be
argued to having **[open]{.mark}ed [society for more individual
rights,]{.mark}** [independent of social class]{.mark}, as working life
before neoliberalism tended to be heavily based on class
hierarchies]{.underline}. Thus, [[the focus on the actual merit]{.mark}
related [to one's]{.mark} [job performance]{.mark}, independent of
class, [is]{.mark} perhaps [the **positive outcome of the new working
life**]{.mark} [where everyone is given]{.mark} the opportunity to take
[control over their]{.mark} own individual [career]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Modern management techniques seek to abolish the traditional
authoritative hierarchy, which initially may sound like a humane
development. However, an outcome of new management can also be that
responsibility becomes much more elusive than in the past. Sennett
(1998) for instance views the tendency to diminish the traditional
hierarchy of authority and instead make every worker responsible in the
new capitalism with suspicion. [[Neoliberalism forces]{.mark} each and
[every one to accept a greater responsibility for themselves]{.mark} and
their individual careers.]{.underline} Who then holds the responsibility
for 'the bigger picture' traditionally guaranteed by the state? What
happens to traditional politics? As one manager states when confronted
with the decline in jobs: 'We are all victims of time and place'
(Sennett, 1998, p. 114). **[[Neoliberalism is]{.mark} in a sense
[freeing everyone]{.mark}]{.underline}** and leaving no one to blame for
the misery, not even top managers. The conditions of
[[whistleblowing]{.mark} under neoliberalism]{.underline} can therefore
be seen as a paradox as neoliberalism is based on a firm belief in the
sole individual's capacity while traditional moral at the same time
becomes superfluous (cf. Dufour, 2008). Transferred to the organisation
this means that the [organisation [depends]{.mark} more [on workers to
report wrongdoing]{.mark}]{.underline}, while morals are silently, but
methodologically downplayed (cf. Sennett, 1998). The long-term effects
of globalised neoliberalism can thus be a loss of community and faith in
local values (cf. Nafstad, et al., 2007). Such [[collective
resources]{.mark} that individuals traditionally [have]{.mark} drawn
upon to [become moral agents]{.mark}. Organisational [members]{.mark}
that [report wrongdoing]{.mark} at work is one example of such 'moral
agents']{.underline} (Tsahuridu & Vandekerckhove, 2008, p. 111).

**Util is good**

Professional and Applied Ethics). "In Defense of Utilitarianism." Annual
Conference: Australian Association for Professional and Applied Ethics,
June 2009. http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1534305

[The most significant reason for advocating [utility theory]{.mark}
however, is that it [is useful]{.mark} and usable. The [institutions in
our society]{.mark} -- the professional, industry and special interest
groups, as well as organisations in business and government, plus the
not for profit sector - [are faced with]{.mark} many [ethical decisions,
often complex and difficult, requiring]{.mark} considerable thought, and
[eventual]{.mark}ly [resolution.]{.mark} The moral issues that arise in
these contexts are fundamental to the institutional functioning of our
society. **[Yet very few people have training in]{.mark} moral
[philosophy. They need a relatively straightforward way of making these
decisions]{.mark}** -- of telling right from wrong.]{.underline} Mill,
it will be argued, provides that method. Many who have no training that
are faced with these ethical choices will rely on intuition. [[Perhaps
they will use]{.mark} a set of [values learned at home]{.mark}, or from
their schooling or their church. As we shall see [for]{.mark} the [more
difficult ethical issues, however, intuition is an unreliable
guide.]{.mark} If they have training, they may remember virtue ethics,
or Kant's deontology, but as I shall also argue later, these theories do
not necessarily give straightforward and acceptable
answers.]{.underline} The statement that some ethical issues are
difficult to resolve should generate little disagreement. Any teacher of
professional ethics can identify issues where the profession disagrees
on the ethics of a particular practice. Reverse auctions, for instance,
where providers of the product or service bid increasingly lower prices,
have generated debate on whether we are sacrificing quality or safety
for a lower price. Front end loading, where the work items executed
earlier are loaded 3 with a higher percentage of the supplier‟s
overheads has generated a similar debate. Whistleblowing is yet another
issue where the ethics are debated - whether the person revealing the
wrongdoing is ignoring the ethical obligation of loyalty to his or her
employer. Or whether the risk of retaliation and losing one‟s job
outweighs the moral obligation to reveal the truth. We are also all
aware of the concept of group think, where people in an organisation
tend to accept the prevailing opinion, rather than question it. This may
have been a cause behind many of the ethical failures seen over recent
years in HIH, James Hardie, the Australian Wheat Board and other
companies. The fact that no executive spoke out against the unethical
behaviours then practised tells us that those who want honesty and
transparency were not confident enough of themselves or their judgement
to speak out. Alternatively, the failure to speak out may have been due
to the tendency to find a justification for an unethical action. Wheat
Board people possibly convinced themselves for instance, that they were
acting in the best interests of the Australian farmer, and therefore of
the nation. And so the national benefits outweighed the negatives of
their action. [A relatively straight forward way to cut through such
fuzzy thinking would be the prior resolution of many of these issues.
[Util]{.mark}itarianism, it will be argued, [provides]{.mark} that
method. It would give [those who wish to live]{.mark} and work [within
an ethical environment stronger tools with which to]{.mark} decide how
they should [react.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**Extinction first -- VTL inevitable**

**Bernstein '2** (Richard J., Vera List Prof. Phil. -- New School for
Social Research, "Radical Evil: A Philosophical Interrogation", p.
188-192)

[[There is a basic value inherent in]{.mark} organic [being]{.mark}, a
basic affirmation, \"The Yes\' of Life\" (IR 81). 15 \"The
self-affirmation of being becomes [emphatic in the opposition]{.mark} of
life [to death]{.mark}]{.underline}. Life is the explicit confrontation
of being with not-being. . . . The \'yes\' of all striving is here
sharpened by the active \`no\' to not-being\" (IR 81-2). Furthermore ---
and this is the crucial point for Jonas --- [[this affirmation]{.mark}
of life that is in all organic being **[has a binding obligatory
force]{.mark}** upon human beings. This blindly self-enacting \"yes\"
gains obligating force in the seeing freedom of man, who as the supreme
outcome of nature\'s purposive labor is no longer its automatic executor
but, with the power obtained from knowledge, can become its destroyer as
well. He must adopt the \"yes\" into his will and impose the \"no\" to
not-being on his power]{.underline}. But precisely this transition from
willing to obligation is the critical point of moral theory at which
attempts at laying a foundation for it come so easily to grief. Why does
now, in man, that become a duty which hitherto \"being\" itself took
care of through all individual willings? (IR 82). We discover here the
transition from is to \"ought\" --- from the self-affirmation of life to
the binding obligation of human beings to preserve life not only for the
present but also for the future. But why do we need a new ethics? The
subtitle of The Imperative of Responsibility --- In Search of an Ethics
for the Technological Age --- indicates why we need a new ethics.
[[Modern technology]{.mark} has [transformed]{.mark} the nature and
[consequences of human action so]{.mark} radically that the underlying
premises of **[traditional ethics are no longer valid]{.mark}**. For the
first time in history [human beings possess]{.mark} the knowledge and
the [power to destroy]{.mark} life on [this planet]{.mark}, including
human life. Not only is there the new possibility of total nuclear
disaster; there are the even more invidious and threatening
possibilities that result from the unconstrained use of technologies
that can destroy the environment required for life.]{.underline} The
major transformation brought about by modern technology is that the
consequences of our actions frequently exceed by far anything we can
envision. Jonas was one of the first philosophers to warn us about the
unprecedented ethical and political problems that arise with the rapid
development of biotechnology. He claimed that this was happening at a
time when there was an \"ethical vacuum,\" when there did not seem to be
any effective ethical principles to limit ot guide our ethical
decisions. In the name of scientific and technological \"progress,\"
there is a relentless pressure to adopt a stance where virtually
anything is permissible, includ-ing transforming the genetic structure
of human beings, as long as it is \"freely chosen.\" [We
need]{.underline}, Jonas argued, [[a new categorical imperative]{.mark}
that [might be]{.mark}]{.underline} formulated [as follows:]{.underline}
\"[Act so that the effects of your action are compatible with the
permanence of genuine human life\"; or expressed
negatively]{.underline}: \"Act so that the effects of your action are
not destructive of the future possibility of such a life\"; or simply:
\"[**[Do not compromise]{.mark}** the]{.underline} [conditions for **[an
indefinite continuation of humanity on earth]{.mark}**\"; or again
turned positive:]{.underline} \"In your present choices, include the
future wholeness of Man among the objects of your will.\"
