### 2AC --- Topicality "Arms" (Excludes Spare Parts, Maintenance, Training, etc.)

#### 1. [Counter-Interpretation: AECA]{.underline} --- "arms" means [defense articles]{.underline}, [services]{.underline}, and [technical data]{.underline}.

In addition to sales to DOD, the U.S. TWV industrial base also sells
vehicles to foreign governments. [The sale of U.S. arms]{.underline} and
dual-use items, including TWVs, [to friendly nations and allies is an
integral component of]{.underline} both [U.S. national security and
foreign policy]{.underline}.1 [[The]{.underline}]{.mark} Arms Export
Control Act ([[AECA]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[authorizes]{.mark} the
President to control the [export and import of
arms]{.mark}]{.underline}.2 [The AECA authorizes the U.S. government to
sell arms to foreign governments [through]{.mark}
government-to-government agreements as part of the]{.underline} Foreign
Military Sales ([[FMS]{.underline}]{.mark}) [program]{.underline}.3 [[It
also authorizes]{.mark} the issuance of export licenses for U.S.
manufacturers [to **sell**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[end page 1\]
[[**arms** directly]{.mark} to eligible foreign governments, [known
as]{.mark}]{.underline} direct commercial sales
([[DCS]{.underline}]{.mark}). [Regardless of the method of sale, each
FMS request or DCS license application is reviewed by officials from DOD
and]{.underline} the Department of State ([State]{.underline}) [to
ensure the sale would not result in harm to U.S. interests and is
consistent with national security and foreign policies]{.underline}.

**------ Footnotes ------**

1\. For the purposes of this report, [[the term arms refers to **defense
articles**, **defense services**, and **related technical data**]{.mark}
as specified by 22 U.S.C. § 2778 and defined in 22 C.F.R. Part
120]{.underline}. Dual-use items are those which have both military and
commercial applications.

2\. 22 U.S.C. §§ 2751-2799aa-2.

3\. FMS is limited to eligible countries and international
organizations. 22 U.S.C. § 2753.

#### 2. [Aff Ground DA]{.underline} --- major sales to the largest purchasers [include]{.underline} spare parts, maintenance, and training.

**GAO 4** --- Government Accountability Office, 2004 ("Foreign Military
Sales: Improved Army Controls Could Prevent Unauthorized Shipments of

[From 1993 through 2002, the]{.underline} Department of Defense
([DOD]{.underline}) [delivered over \$150 billion in [services and
defense articles]{.mark}---including classified]{.underline}1 [spare
parts and unclassified items containing military
technology]{.underline}2---[to foreign countries [through
f]{.mark}]{.underline}oreign [[m]{.underline}]{.mark}ilitary
[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}ales programs administered by the military
services. [Some sales [occurred using blanket orders]{.mark}, which are
requisitions for a specific dollar value and are [designed to simplify
supply actions on]{.mark} certain categories of [items for which]{.mark}
f]{.underline}oreign [m]{.underline}ilitary [s]{.underline}ales
[[customers will have a recurring need, such as]{.mark} **unclassified
[spare parts]{.mark}**[, **repair parts**, **minor components**,
**training films**, and **publications**]{.mark}]{.underline}. According
to DOD policy,3 the management of classified spare parts and
unclassified items containing military technology is particularly
important given their potential to be released to foreign countries that
may use them against U.S. interests. Under blanket orders, the Army's
policy is intended to restrict the categories of items including
classified materials.

**------ Footnotes ------**

1\. Classified parts are restricted for national security reasons.

2\. DOD defines military technology as military critical technology that
would reveal or give insight into the design and manufacture of U.S.
military systems and materials and, if exported, would permit
significant advance in the military potential of any country. Some of
these items require demilitarization prior to release to the public.

#### 3. [Precision DA]{.underline} --- non-AECA definitions are [not predictable]{.underline}. 

**DSCA 19** --- Defense Security Cooperation Agency, an agency within
the U.S. Department of Defense that provides financial and technical
assistance, transfer of defense matériel, training, and services to
allies, and promotes military-to-military contacts, 2019 ("Glossary:
Arms Control Export Act (AECA)," *Security Assistant Cooperation
Management Manual*, Available Online at
https://www.samm.dsca.mil/glossary/arms-export-control-act-aeca,
Accessed 07-30-2019)

Arms Control Export Act (AECA): [[The]{.mark} basic U.S. [law providing
the authority and general rules for the conduct of f]{.mark}oreign
[m]{.mark}ilitary [s]{.mark}ales [and c]{.mark}ommercial [s]{.mark}ales
[of **defense articles**, **defense services**, and
**training**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The AECA came into existence with the
passage of the Foreign Military Sales Act (FMSA) of 1968. An amendment
in the International Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Act of
1976 changed the name of FMSA to the AECA.

#### 4. [No Limits or Neg Ground DA]{.underline} --- FMS and DCS [only]{.underline} include defense articles and services, not unrelated items. Including all of FMS/DCS is better for aff [and]{.underline} neg ground because it creates [bigger affs]{.underline} with [better links]{.underline} to core generics like the Supplier Shift DA. 

#### 5. [Good Is Good Enough]{.underline} --- it's the Saudi aff. C'mon. (Searching for the best definition is an [endless distraction]{.underline} from topic education. Prioritize [debatability]{.underline} --- definitional precision is only [a means to that end]{.underline}.)

### Extend: "Counter-Interpretation"

#### They misunderstand "arms" --- it [includes]{.underline} "components thereof" and training.
