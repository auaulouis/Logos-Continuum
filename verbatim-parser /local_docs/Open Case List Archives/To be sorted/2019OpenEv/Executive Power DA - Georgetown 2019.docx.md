VI\. CONCLUSION Most [controversies between Congress **and** the White
House]{.underline} over information [are decided more by politics than
by law]{.underline}, and so a settlement is usually reached [favoring
the party with the public wind to its back]{.underline}. n348
**[Questions of law should not be decided in that
fashion]{.underline}**. Therefore, [the reach and scope of executive
privilege should be settled by the courts]{.underline} in such
situations, [**so that [the President]{.mark}\'s power is not
[impaired]{.mark}** whenever the political wind is in the President\'s
face and at his opponents\' backs]{.underline}, or the President is
inappropriately shielded when political tides flow in his favor. While
the best outcome in any interbranch dispute is the political branches
reaching a settlement, \"such compromise may not always be available, or
even desirable.\" n349 It is not desirable [where **it [sets a
precedent]{.mark}** **[that degrades]{.mark} one of [the]{.mark} three
[branch]{.mark}es of government. [If one branch]{.mark} of government
[demands something to which it is not]{.mark} constitutionally
[entitled]{.mark} and that the Constitution has fully vested in a
coequal branch, [the vested branch should not]{.mark} be required to
[negotiate]{.mark} on the question**]{.underline}. Negotiation usually
involves compromise. [This]{.underline} negotiation [would often result
in **[one]{.mark} branch [needing to cede to the other,
encourag]{.mark}ing [additional]{.mark}**]{.underline} unconstitutional
**[[demands in the future]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Though this may
perhaps be a quicker route to a resolution, **[it [disrupts]{.mark} the
[constitutional balance]{.mark} in government]{.underline}**. As the
Supreme Court has recently explained, \"\'convenience and efficiency are
not the primary objectives\--or the hallmarks\--of democratic
government.\'\" n350 President [Reagan declared that \"you aren\'t
President; you are temporarily custodian of an institution, the
Presidency]{.underline}. And [you don\'t have any right to do away with
any of the prerogatives of that institution, and one of those is
executive privilege]{.underline}. And **[this is what was being
attacked]{.underline}** by the Congress.\" n351 Thus, **[[any White
House has the obligation to]{.underline}]{.mark}** fight to [**[protect
executive privilege]{.mark}**, and the courts should]{.underline} draw
the line to [preserve that constitutional prerogative]{.underline}.
Likewise, there are times when it is the President who is refusing to
give Congress its due under the Constitution, where Congress must assert
its prerogatives for future generations. Conversely, where
confidentiality is not warranted, courts must ensure public disclosure
and accountability.

#### Flexible executive power solves [terrorism]{.underline}, [rogue states]{.underline}, and [WMD prolif]{.underline} -- new legal checks are [existentially dangerous]{.underline}

[[Our Constitution]{.mark} has **succeeded**]{.underline} [because it
[favors **swift presidential action in war**]{.mark}]{.underline}, later
checked by Congress's funding power. If a president continues to wage
war without congressional authorization, as in Libya, Kosovo, or Korea,
it is only because Congress has chosen not to exercise its easy check.
We should not confuse a desire to escape political responsibility for a
defect in the Constitution. [[A **radical change**]{.mark} **in the
system**]{.underline} [for making war might appease critics of
presidential power]{.underline}. [But it [could]{.mark} also
**[seriously threaten American national security]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[In order [to **forestall another 9/11**]{.mark}]{.underline} attack,
[[or]{.underline}]{.mark} [take advantage of a window of opportunity to
[**strike terrorists** or **rogue nations**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[the
executive]{.mark} branch [needs **flexibility**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[It is not hard to think of situations where congressional consent
cannot be obtained in time to act]{.underline}. [Time for congressional
[deliberation]{.mark}]{.underline}, which can lead to passivity and
isolation and not smarter decisions, [[will come at the price of
**speed** and **secrecy**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Constitution creates
a presidency that can respond forcefully to prevent serious threats to
our national security. [Presidents can take the initiative]{.underline},
[and Congress can use its funding power to check
presidents]{.underline}. [Instead of demanding a **legalistic
process**]{.underline} to begin war, [the Framers left war to
politics]{.underline}. [[As we confront]{.mark} the new challenges
of]{.underline} [**[terrorism]{.underline}**, **[rogue
nations]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[WMD
proliferation]{.underline}**, [now is **not the time** to introduce
**sweeping**]{.underline}, **[untested changes]{.underline}**]{.mark} in
the way we make war.

\[William R, 14-03-2011, Strategy Research Project, AN ERA OF PERSISTENT
CONFLICT

[Exceptional individuals are key contributors to the turmoil the U.S.
experienced in the last decade]{.underline} through the present, and
[their objectives could portend continued conflict.]{.underline} While
the existence of these exceptional individuals alone does not
necessarily assure conflict, [the [ideologies]{.mark} they espouse [are
underpinned by religion adding a]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[nondeterrable]{.underline}** **[dimension]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to
their struggle]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} actual or **[perceived
preponderance]{.underline}** [of U.S. power will not diminish the
likelihood of future attacks]{.underline}. In fact, such attacks will
only serve to enhance these organizations' status and power, fueling
every aspect of their operations from recruiting to financing
operations. Consequently, [threats from non-state actors will
continue]{.underline}. Depending on the potential destruction inflicted
by any terrorist attack, the attacker's sanctuary, and the threat posed
to the aforementioned governments, the U.S. may be compelled to fight
wars similar to the war in Afghanistan. [[Conflict with another state
is]{.underline}]{.mark} possible, though [**[less
likely]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [Although the relative decline of U.S.
economic power in relation to China appears to constitute a
potential]{.underline} ―window‖ or [threat]{.underline} to peace, [both
governments are aware of the **risks** and are **working to mitigate**
them.]{.underline} Moreover, [[the U.S., China, and Russia represent
**deterrable nuclear powers**]{.mark},]{.underline} states dissuaded
from conflict with each other due to the potential costs of a nuclear
exchange. [Conflict between these states appears unlikely]{.underline}.
However, [[existing theory suggests **problems with nondeterrable
states**]{.mark} that are not responsive to punishment or are willing to
take risks that prompt conflict. [North Korea]{.mark} and [Iran]{.mark}
seem to fit this description.]{.underline} [Their efforts to
develop]{.underline}, acquire, [and]{.underline} possibly [proliferate
nuclear weapons]{.underline}, [combined with [the potential threat posed
by a **non-state actor**]{.mark} acquiring such weapons,]{.underline}
[form conditions that indicate a strong possibility of war.]{.underline}
In particular, Iran's nuclear program presents a potentially ominous
window. Should diplomacy, sanctions, and cyber attacks fail to sidetrack
Iran's nuclear program, [the U.S. will be presented with an
ever-narrowing window to act with force]{.underline} to deny Iran this
capability. This could result in conflict with Iran. While false
optimism is a potent and pervasive cause of war, [recent experience with
war and the nature of these and likely future conflicts will diminish
leaders support for initiating war.]{.underline} Similarly, [the current
economic conditions and concern over the national debt will dampen
leaders' enthusiasm for wars]{.underline}. But [existing theories that
discuss these factors fail to consider the impact of non-state
actors]{.underline}. [Thus]{.underline}, **[conflict is still possible
despite them.]{.underline}** Overall, [the combination of factors seems
to indicate]{.underline} [continuing conflict with nonstate
actors]{.underline} [and]{.underline} potential [conflict with states
over]{.underline} development and **[proliferation]{.underline}** of
nuclear weapons. [[These factors]{.mark} identify specific circumstances
where U.S. involvement in war is likely, and [represent
the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[primary drivers]{.underline}**]{.mark} for
concluding that the current era will be one
[**[of]{.mark}**]{.underline} persistent
**[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The U.S. government should use all
of the elements of power to focus on these factors to prevent what
history and theory suggest the inevitability of war.

[The spread of nuclear weapons poses a number of severe threats to
international peace and security including: nuclear war, nuclear
terrorism, global and regional instability]{.underline}, constrained
freedom of action, [weakened alliances, and further nuclear
proliferation]{.underline}. Each of these threats has received extensive
treatment elsewhere and this review is not intended to replicate or even
necessarily to improve upon these previous efforts. Rather the goals of
this section are more modest: to usefully bring together and recap the
many reasons why we should be pessimistic about the likely consequences
of nuclear proliferation. Many of these threats will be illuminated with
a discussion of a case of much contemporary concern: Iran's advanced
nuclear program. Nuclear War. [The greatest threat posed by the spread
of nuclear weapons is nuclear war. [The more states in **possession** of
nuclear weapons, the greater the **probability**]{.mark} that somewhere,
someday, [there will be a]{.mark} **catastrophic [nuclear
war]{.mark}**.]{.underline} To date, nuclear weapons have only been used
in warfare once. In 1945, the United States used nuclear weapons on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, bringing World War II to a close. Many analysts
point to the sixty-five-plus-year tradition of nuclear non-use as
evidence that nuclear weapons are unusable, but [it would be naïve to
think that nuclear weapons will never be used again simply because they
have not been used for some time]{.underline}. After all, analysts in
the 1990s argued that worldwide economic downturns like the great
depression were a thing of the past, only to be surprised by the dot-com
bubble bursting later in the decade and the Great Recession of the late
Naughts.49 This author, for one, would be surprised if nuclear weapons
are not used again sometime in his lifetime. [Before reaching a state of
MAD, [new **nuclear states**]{.mark} go through a **transition** period
in which they [lack]{.mark} a secure-**[second strike
capability]{.mark}**. In this context, one or both states might believe
that it has an incentive to use nuclear weapons first]{.underline}. For
example, if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, neither Iran, nor its
nuclear-armed rival, Israel, will have a secure, secondstrike
capability. Even though it is believed to have a large arsenal, given
its small size and lack of strategic depth, Israel might not be
confident that it could absorb a nuclear strike and respond with a
devastating counterstrike. Similarly, Iran might eventually be able to
build a large and survivable nuclear arsenal, but, when it first crosses
the nuclear threshold, Tehran will have a small and vulnerable nuclear
force. [In these pre-MAD situations, there are at least three ways that
nuclear war could occur. First, the state with the **nuclear advantage**
might believe it has a splendid **first strike**
capability]{.underline}. In a crisis, Israel might, therefore, decide to
launch a preventive nuclear strike to disarm Iran's nuclear
capabilities. Indeed, this incentive might be further increased by
Israel's aggressive strategic culture that emphasizes preemptive action.
Second, [[the state with a small]{.mark} and vulnerable **nuclear
[arsenal]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in this case Iran, [[might feel **use
'em** or **loose 'em** pressures]{.underline}]{.mark}. That is, in a
crisis, Iran might decide to strike first rather than risk having its
entire nuclear arsenal destroyed. Third, as Thomas Schelling has argued,
[[nuclear war could result due to]{.mark} the [**reciprocal fear** of
**surprise attack**]{.mark}]{.underline}.50 If there are advantages to
striking first, [one state might start a nuclear war in the belief that
war is **inevitable** and that it would be better to **go first** than
to **go second**]{.underline}. Fortunately, there is no historic
evidence of this dynamic occurring in a nuclear context, but it is still
possible. In an Israeli-Iranian crisis, for example, Israel and Iran
might both prefer to avoid a nuclear war, but decide to strike first
rather than suffer a devastating first attack from an opponent. Even in
a world of MAD, however, when both sides have secure, second-slrike
capabilities, there is still a risk of nuclear war. Rational deterrence
theory assumes nuclear-armed states are governed by rational leaders who
would not intentionally launch a suicidal nuclear war. This assumption
appears to have applied to past and current nuclear powers, but there is
no guarantee that it will continue to hold in the future. Iran\'s
theocratic government, despite its inflammatory rhetoric, has followed a
fairly pragmatic foreign policy since 1979. but h contains leaders who
hold millenarian religious worldviews and could one day ascend to power.
We cannot rule out the possibility that, [as nuclear weapons continue to
**spread**, some leader somewhere will choose to launch a **nuclear
war**]{.underline}, knowing full well that it could result in
self-destruction. [One does not need to resort to **irrationality**,
however, to imagine **nuclear war** under MAD]{.underline}. Nuclear
weapons may deter leaders from intentionally launching full-scale wars,
but they do not mean the end of international politics. As was discussed
above, [nuclear-armed [states still have conflicts of **interest** and
**leaders** still seek to coerce]{.mark} **nuclear-armed
[adversaries]{.mark}**. Leaders might,]{.underline} therefore, [choose
to launch a limited nuclear war]{.underline}.51 This strategy might be
especially attractive to states in a position of conventional
inferiority that might have an incentive to escalate a crisis quickly.
During the Cold War, the United States planned to use nuclear weapons
first to stop a Soviet invasion of Western Europe given NATO's
conventional inferiority.52 As Russia's conventional power has
deteriorated since the end of the Cold War, Moscow has come to rely more
heavily on nuclear weapons in its military doctrine. Indeed, [Russian
strategy calls for the use of nuclear weapons early in a
conflict]{.underline} (something that most Western strategists would
consider to be escalatory) [as a way to de-escalate a
crisis.]{.underline} Similarly, [Pakistan's military plans for nuclear
use in the event of an invasion from conventionally
stronger]{.underline} India. And finally, [Chinese generals openly talk
about the possibility of nuclear use against a U.S. superpower in a
possible East Asia contingency]{.underline}. Second, as was also
discussed above, leaders can make a "threat that leaves something to
chance."53 They can initiate a nuclear crisis. [By playing these
[**risky games** of nuclear **brinkmanship**]{.mark}, states can
[increases]{.mark} the [risk of **nuclear war** in an attempt to force
a]{.mark} **less resolved** [adversary to back
down]{.mark}]{.underline}. Historical crises have not resulted in
nuclear war, but many of them, including the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis,
have come close. And scholars have documented historical incidents when
[accidents nearly led to war.54 When we think about future nuclear
crisis dyads]{.underline}, such as Iran and Israel, [with fewer sources
of stability than existed during the Cold War, we can see that there is
a real risk that a future crisis could result in a devastating nuclear
exchange]{.underline}.

#### A strong presidency is key to [American hegemony]{.underline} and a robust, stable [international order]{.underline}

**Waśko-Owsiejczuk 17**, Ewelina, University of Bialystok "Is America
safer today? The first changes to U.S. foreign and security policy
during the presidency of Donald Trump" Przegląd Politologiczny
(Political Science Review) Issue 3, pp 161-178

**[[The]{.mark} influence and [role of the]{.mark} U.S. [president
in]{.mark} creating [foreign and security policy is superior to that of
other organs]{.mark} of public authority]{.underline}**. [This is mainly
[due to]{.mark}]{.underline} the specifics of the presidential system
and the U.S. Constitution, which assigns him **[[a wide range of power
as chief executive]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It is worth noting that [the
U.S. Constitution details the powers of Congress in detail. This is not
the case for the function and position of the president, where the
wording is very general, leaving a wide field for arbitrary
interpretation]{.underline}, [which is the starting point for extending
the capabilities and power of the president]{.underline}
(Dziemidok-Olszewska, 2009, p. 154 et seq). Thus[, [the
president]{.mark} of the United States [has]{.mark} quite [a diverse
role as a symbol]{.mark} of the state and the people of the United
States, as the [head of the armed forces]{.mark}, [chief of
diplomacy]{.mark}, leader of the party, [chief executive]{.mark},
national spokesman, [promoter of economic development]{.mark} and world
leader]{.underline} (Amos, Jordan, Taylor, Meese, Nielsen, Schlesinger,
2009, p. 77). As some researchers point out, the broad powers conferred
on the president make him the most important actor in U.S. foreign and
security policy (Ulrich, 2012, p. 63). While serving as head of state
and head of government, the U.S. president is responsible for the
preparation and implementation of the budget, nominating powers (e.g.
the nomination of the secretary of state) and the administrative
activities of overseeing the cabinet, agencies and executive committees
(Wordliczek, 2003, pp. 96--118). Such strong power in the presidential
system carries the risk of abuse. Thus, a braking mechanism is needed,
which in the U.S. is the principle of checks and balances between the
executive, legislative and judiciary branches of government (Hill, 2001,
p. 43). In the context of foreign and security policy, Congress carries
out their control function by accepting presidential nominations or
receiving reports on the activities of government agencies
(Waśko-Owsiejczuk, 2014, p. 87). However, the most important element of
control the legislative body has over the executive body is the right to
declare war and to allocate a budget for it, which is the responsibility
of Congress and not the president (Michałek, 2005, pp. 65--66). In order
to implement foreign and security policy, the president is equipped with
important tools, including executive orders and presidential directives.
Executive orders, which do not require congressional approval, are
usually directed at federal agencies. Often these are important
decisions that cause changes in American legislation. Presidential
directives are also an important security policy instrument. Although
signed or endorsed by the president of the United States, this document
is usually handled by the National Security Council. Presidential
directives are often secret and, although they are usually targeted at
specific government agencies, their scope includes the executive,
legislative and judicial branches of the federal government, as well as
state and local governments (Waśko-Owsiejczuk, 2014, p. 58). Apart from
the legal position of the president in shaping foreign and security
policy, non-constitutional factors also play a role, such as the
personality of a given president, his skills and style of governance,
and the situational context in which leadership is exercised
(Antoszewski, 2014, p. 23). President Harry Truman's assistant, Richard
Neustadt, once said: "Americans like to judge their leader not in terms
of competence or incompetence, but in terms of strength or weakness"
(see: Czulda, 2010, p. 60). The personality characteristics and
predispositions that one should have in order to function effectively as
the head of a superpower include strength, courage and confidence. Less
important is competence, or whether the candidate in question is an
economics or foreign policy expert, since he is assisted by a wide
circle of trusted associates. This must be a strong leader who cares for
citizens' security and the development of the country. The president of
a superpower should also have charisma and be a good speaker, thus
exciting his listeners (Waldman, 2000, p. 105). [[What is more
important]{.mark} than political correctness [are attributes such
as]{.mark} **[decisiveness and firmness]{.mark}** in the leader of the
most powerful state in the world]{.underline} (Ludwikowski, Ludwikowska,
2009, pp. 122--123). [There is even a concept called the imperial
presidency, referring to the position and function of the U.S.
president]{.underline}. Here, it is understood that the president is
seen as almost predestined to be the leader of an international empire
(Shafritz, 1993, pp. 378--379). Americans are able to forgive their
president many things, but not weakness and the inability to exercise
power. The external environment plays an important role in the process
of shaping foreign and security policy. The political parties and
Congress can be either a partner or opponent to the president. The
media, public opinion, interest groups, and the international community
(see: Amos, Jordan, Taylor, Meese, Nielsen, Schlesinger, 2009, p. 77)
can all exert pressure, thus influencing the decision-making process of
the White House. Another important group is the National Security
Council, whose main purpose is to advise the U.S. president on state
security, taking into account internal, national, foreign and military
policies. This group includes the vice president, the secretary of
state, the treasury secretary, the defense secretary and the president's
national security adviser (Shafritz, 1993, p. 317; Best, 2011, p. 1 et
seq). [[The]{.mark} unique ([privileged]{.mark}) [position of the United
States in the international system]{.mark} also [has influence on the
role]{.mark} and position [of the president in foreign and security
policy]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Since the end of the Cold War]{.underline}
and the breakup of the Soviet Union, [the United States has become a
superpower]{.underline}1 with a dominant role in the international
system.2 [Two factors -- military and political -- play a crucial role
here]{.underline}. [U.S. defense expenditure accounts for nearly 50% of
global defense spending]{.underline} (Roser, Nagdy, 2017). [Its enormous
military potential and modern military technology provide the United
States with a dominant international position]{.underline}. Americans
want to maintain their status as the most powerful military in the world
not only to deter potential enemies from attacking the U.S., but also to
enable military action in almost every region of the world. The military
potential of the superpower is so large that it is the only state in the
world which has armed forces capable of carrying out military operations
on a global scale. According to the doctrine of two and a half wars, the
superpower can simultaneously carry out two wars and one conflict in any
part of the world (Balcerowicz, 2010, pp. 74--77). **[Equally important
is the political factor]{.underline}**. [[The power of the United States
is]{.mark} also [manifested through its role and position in
international organizations]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is difficult to
imagine the functioning and smooth operation of organizations without
U.S. involvement, especially those that originated from their own
initiative, such as the UN, NATO and NAFTA. The strength of the position
of the U.S. on the international stage can be observed not only through
records and regulations, or through its permanent membership on the UN
Security Council, but also through the actions of the superpower. For
example, one of its actions was the unlawful invasion of Iraq in March
2003, despite criticism and opposition from the international community,
including most of the members of the UN Security Council. The actions of
the United Nations after the U.S. invasion of Iraq were also important
in showing the strength of the position of the U.S. in the international
system. Not only did the United States face no consequences, but the UN
called on other states to support the efforts of the U.S. coalition to
rebuild Iraq (Waśko- Owsiejczuk, 2016b, pp. 133--153). As it turned out,
the UN was completely helpless against the unlawful actions of its
strongest member. [[The dominant position]{.mark} of the U.S. in the
world, **[coupled with the strong]{.mark} position of the
[president]{.mark}** in a presidential system of government, [not only
**makes the**]{.mark} **role of the [leader]{.mark} of the superpower
[superior]{.mark}** in creating foreign and security policy, [but is of
**crucial importance for the whole international
system**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, [the [decisions]{.mark} and actions
of the U.S. president [have a significant impact]{.mark} and
implications not only [on]{.mark} the internal security of the country,
but also on the **[other participants of international
relations]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Unconstrained Presidency: Checks and Balances Eroded Long Before

[In the age of Donald Trump, it often feels as though one individual has
the power to chart the United States' course in the world all by
himself. Since taking office as U.S. president, [Trump]{.mark} has made
a series of unilateral [decisions]{.mark} with enormous
consequences.]{.underline} He walked away from the Trans-Pacific
Partnership, the Paris agreement on climate change, and the Iran nuclear
deal. He imposed tariffs on Canada, China, Mexico, and the European
Union. In June, he single-handedly upended the G-7 summit by insulting
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and withdrawing the United States
from the group's joint communiqué. In July, his European travels
produced more diplomatic fireworks, with a NATO summit in Brussels that
raised questions about his commitment to the organization---before his
deferential press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
**[Each choice has [brought howls]{.mark} of outrage---[but little real
pushback.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[Congress]{.mark}, for example, has
[proved unable to block]{.mark} the president from [starting a trade
war]{.mark}]{.underline} with China and with U.S. allies. [[For
all]{.mark} of Trump's [talk of a shadowy "deep state"]{.mark} bent on
undermining his every move, [the]{.mark} U.S. government's vast
[bureaucracy has **watched**]{.mark} as the president has dragged his
feet on a plan to deter Russian election interference]{.underline}. Even
the United States' closest allies have been unable to talk Trump out of
damaging and potentially withdrawing from institutions of the liberal
international order that the country has led for decades. How can a
political system vaunted for its checks and balances allow one person to
act so freely? [In reality, the problem goes well beyond Trump, and even

Donald [[Trump has **more power to go to war**]{.mark} [than]{.mark}
**[any American president in the last 40 years]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[a new report has found]{.underline}. [A study published by the
University of Waterloo]{.underline} in Canada [found the military
actions of [former]{.mark} [presidents]{.mark} George W Bush and Barack
Obama [have]{.mark} ultimately [handed]{.mark} President
[Trump]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[greater power]{.mark} [to carry out
military intervention]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [In examining US military
interventions between 2001 and 2016]{.underline}, [the paper found
significant parallels in the way Bush and Obama tackled and traversed
consultation and authorisation procedures]{.underline} with Congress and
the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). [Both of President [Trump's
predecessors]{.mark} [went to war **unilaterally**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[rather than getting permission from Congress]{.underline}. Although
it's worth noting [this is by no means a precedent started by Bush and
Obama]{.underline}. **[Republican and Democrat
[presidents]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[have a **long history** of]{.mark}
[carrying out military op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} **[without approval
of congress]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- [especially since the end of the
Second World War]{.underline}. \"Right now, Donald [[Trump]{.underline}
[has an **enormous amount** of power]{.underline}]{.mark} [to launch
military action, [perhaps]{.mark} [more than **any president since the
Vietnam War**]{.mark}]{.underline},\" the report's author, Aaron

days leading up to Friday night's strikes by U.S., French and British
forces on Syrian President Bashar Assad's chemical weapons

most since World War II, has struggled to play its constitutional role
in America's armed conflicts. Senate Foreign Relations Chairman [[Bob

[When Thursday rolled around, the Tennessee Republican said he would
delay releasing the measure.]{.underline} Then he said he planned to
share it with members Friday. [That night]{.underline}, as U.S. warships
launched missiles at a sovereign country in an operation unrelated to
the 9/11 assault or the group that carried it out, [no members signaled

### counterterrorism working now

#### Counterterrorism is [working now]{.underline} because of [aggressive actions abroad]{.underline}

Daniel **Byman 17**, Senior Fellow at Brookings - Foreign Policy, Center
for Middle East Policy, "The year in review: Counterterrorism",
12-29-17,
https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/12/29/the-year-in-review-counterterrorism/

U.S. national security suffered in 2017. Russia is running amok, allies
are losing faith in American security and prosperity commitments, and
the liberal order is in crisis. [Surrounding these clouds]{.underline},
however, **[[a silver lining stands out]{.underline}]{.mark}**:
**[[counterterrorism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[U.S.
counterterrorism]{.mark} **[proved successful]{.mark} [this
year]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [especially against **jihadist movements**
that have plagued the United States and the world since
9/11]{.underline}. [Jihadist terrorism still poses a
problem]{.underline}, of course, and other forms of terrorism have risen
too in intensity, [but [a look at the]{.mark} terrorism [balance
sheet]{.mark} for 2017 **[shows]{.mark} a [net
positive]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Yet, the U.S. disengagement from the
Middle East provides fertile soil for terrorist groups to grow.
Long-term counterterrorism success requires a reexamination of U.S.
policy in the Middle East at large. [[The collapse]{.mark} [of the
Islamic State's]{.mark} [caliphate]{.mark}]{.underline} in Iraq and
Syria [[represents the **biggest**]{.mark} **counterterrorism
[success]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The Islamic State will go underground
and otherwise try to adapt]{.underline}, [but [losing]{.mark} their
[territory]{.mark} **[dealt a big blow]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [only
three years ago, the group seemed deeply rooted in Iraq and Syria and
was metastasizing in Egypt, Libya and other countries in the Muslim
world]{.underline}. In addition to the U.S. assault on the Islamic
State's territory, [[the group's]{.mark} [virtual]{.mark} [presence is
**under siege**]{.mark} due to counterterrorism efforts]{.underline},
with both the quality and quantity of its propaganda suffering. Even
with the collapse of the Islamic State's caliphate, [so-called
"homegrown violent extremists]{.underline}" (HVEs) [will likely
attack]{.underline}, [the group will strive to restore
itself]{.underline} in Iraq and Syria, [and frustrated, would-be foreign
fighters may also strike]{.underline}. Some of the Islamic State's
thousands of foreign fighters will also return home, posing an
additional danger. Regardless, the collapse of the caliphate dealt a big
blow to Islamic State. Setting aside the fall of the caliphate, [the
[counterterrorism]{.mark} picture **[looks positive]{.mark}**
[from]{.mark} [the perspective of U.S. **homeland
security**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In 2017, nine people died on U.S. soil
from jihadist terrorist attacks]{.underline} (a security guard killed in
Denver, two Americans and six foreign tourists, killed during the
car-ramming attack in New York City). [That's nine too many but it
should not obscure that [the overall number is
**low**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This]{.mark} low number probably
[stems]{.mark} [from]{.mark} a mix of **[strong U.S.
counterterrorism]{.mark} measures abroad**, [**aggressive
investigations** and **better**]{.mark} **[defenses at
home]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and the overall weakness of jihadist
networks in the United States.

### AT: Trump Starts Wars

#### Trump's executive power is perceived as strong now---it's deterring Russia, Iran, and Syria from starting wars

John **Hannah 18,** Foundation for Defense of Democracies senior fellow,
4-16-2018, "Trump Was Right to Strike Syria,"
https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/16/trump-was-right-to-strike-syria/

Let's give credit where credit is due. First, U.S. President Donald
[[Trump set a red line and enforced it]{.underline}]{.mark}. He warned
that the large-scale use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime would
trigger a U.S. attack. When Syrian President Bashar al-Assad crossed
that red line a year ago, Trump responded with 59 cruise missiles that
took out about 20 percent of Syria's operational aircraft. A year later,
[[Trump]{.mark} has [acted again after Assad]{.mark} chose to [challenge
him a second time.]{.mark}]{.underline} This attack was twice as big and
hit multiple targets, including what U.S. defense officials called the
"heart" of Syria's chemical weapons program, substantially degrading
Assad's ability to produce the deadly agents. That ain't peanuts. No,
[there's no guarantee it will end Assad's use of chemical
weapons]{.underline} --- in which case Trump and his military have made
clear that they'll strike again, almost certainly harder than the time
before. And no, nothing that happened Friday night will, in isolation,
alter the trajectory of Syria's bloody civil war. [But the **effective
deployment of U.S. power**]{.underline} in defense of a universal norm
barring the use of some of the world's worst weapons against innocent
men, women, and children [is nevertheless to be applauded]{.underline}
--- limited an objective as it may be. [Also [to be praised is]{.mark}
the possible **[emergence of a commander in chief]{.mark}** [whose
**threats to use force** need to be taken seriously by]{.mark} U.S.
[adversaries]{.mark}. Once established, this kind of
[credibility]{.mark} (while no panacea) [can be]{.mark} a
[powerful]{.mark} instrument in the U.S. foreign-policy arsenal. **[Once
lost, it is hard to recover]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and the consequences
can be severe. For evidence, just see the post-2013 results, from Crimea
to Syria. A second important virtue of Friday night's attack was its
multilateral character. With barely a week's notice, [Britain, France,
and the United States, the three most powerful militaries of the
trans-Atlantic alliance, all permanent members of the United Nations
Security Council, seamlessly operated on the seas and in the skies of
the Middle East to defend their common interests and values against a
murderous Russian and Iranian client.]{.underline} What's the worth of
that kind of unity, coordination, and seriousness of purpose? It's hard
to quantify precisely. But anyone who's ever toiled as a practitioner in
the national security space knows, deep in their bones, that it matters
--- a lot. And it especially matters in the case of a U.S. president who
has too often unfairly --- and, to my mind, dangerously --- discounted
the value of Europe, the West, and the post-World War II system of
institutions and alliances that his predecessors built. In that power
and righteousness of the world's leading liberal democracies acting in
concert, there's a significant value-added that no mere counting of
ships, planes, and missiles can adequately capture. Kudos to the
president and his team for their skill in mounting this posse. It's an
important framework that they hopefully will continue to invest in to
confront the multitude of urgent international challenges now staring us
in the face. A few other related observations: [Say what you will about
the wisdom of some of the president's public messaging last week, but
once he made clear that he again would act to enforce his red line, U.S.
**[adversaries took him deadly seriously]{.mark}**. [Russian ships
dispersed]{.mark} from port. [Syria abandoned its]{.mark} own [air
bases]{.mark} and rushed to co-locate its aircraft near Russian military
assets. And [Iranian-backed fighters]{.mark}, including Hezbollah
forces, allegedly vacated certain positions and **[went to ground for
fear of a possible U.S. strike]{.mark}**. Again, the [fact that]{.mark}
the United States' worst [adversaries]{.mark} appear to [take Trump's
threats with]{.mark} the [seriousness]{.mark} they deserve [is a]{.mark}
very good thing, a genuine]{.underline} national security asset that
needs to be [husbanded, reinforced, and carefully but **[systematically
exploited]{.mark}** going forward]{.underline}. But hopefully last
week's experience also serves as a reminder to the president of the deep
wisdom inherent in the criticism that he's long leveled at his
predecessors: Don't telegraph your military punch[**.** Another
observation: There was much nervous hand-wringing before the strike
about a possible U.S.-Russia confrontation. Rightly so. [**No one wants
World War III** ]{.mark}]{.underline}to break out over Syria[. All
prudent and appropriate measures should be taken to mitigate those
risks. But in some circles, the **hyping** of the concern threatened to
become]{.underline} absolutely ~~paralyzing~~, a justification (or
[excuse) for doing nothing in the face of Assad's abominable use of
weapons of mass destruction.]{.underline}

#### Trump's actions are not designed to escalate but signal resolve to reduce instability. 

James **Carafano 17,** Heritage Vice President for Foreign and Defense
Policy, 4-20-2018, "Trump Has a Foreign Policy Strategy,"
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/trump-has-foreign-policy-strategy-20284?page=2%2C1\]

Even the strongest [America]{.underline}, however, [can't be a global
power without]{.underline} the [willingness to act
globally]{.underline}. And that\'s where Trump\'s declaration of
"[America First"]{.underline} comes in.

What it [means]{.underline} for foreign policy is that [the president
will put]{.underline} the [vital interests of the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [above]{.underline}
the maintenance of [global institutions.]{.underline} That is not an
abandonment of universal values. Every American president deals with the
challenge of protecting interests and promoting values. Trump will focus
on American interests and American values, and [that poses **no threat
to friends and allies**. In many cases, we share]{.underline} the same
[values]{.underline}. In many cases, what\'s in America\'s vital
interest is also in their interest---and best achieved through joint
partnership.

Here is how those animating ideas are currently manifesting themselves
in Trump\'s strategy:

A strategy includes ends (what you are trying to accomplish), means (the
capabilities you will use to do that) and ways (how you are going to do
it). The ends of Trump's strategy are pretty clear. In both talk and
action in the Trump world, [it boils down to]{.underline} three parts of
the world: **[Europe]{.underline}**, **[Asia]{.underline}** [and
the]{.underline} **[Mid]{.underline}**dle **[East]{.underline}**. That
makes sense. [Peace and stability in these **regions** are **vital** to
U.S. interests and are **under assault**.]{.underline} The United States
wants all three parts of the world to settle. [[It is unrealistic
to]{.mark} [think all]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[problems can]{.mark} be
made to [disappear, but]{.mark} it is [not unrealistic to
**significantly reduce**]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**potential** for
**region-wide conflict.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

The means are more than just a strong military. [[Trump believes in
**using** **all**]{.mark} the **[instruments of power]{.mark}**,
**hard** and **soft**.]{.underline} [He]{.underline} has
**[unleashed]{.underline}** Nikki [Haley on the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[N]{.underline}**ations. He has ordered Rex
Tillerson to revamp the State Department so that it is focused on the
core tasks of statecraft and the effective and appropriate use of
foreign assistance. [He wants an intel]{.underline}ligence [community
that delivers intel]{.underline}ligence [and **doesn't just cater** to
what the White House wants to hear.]{.underline} And he has ordered
Homeland Security to shift from being politically correct to
operationally effective. Further, it's clear that Tillerson, Kelly,
Mattis and Sessions are all trying to pull in the same direction.

The ways of the [Trump strategy are not]{.underline} the
[engagement]{.underline} and enlargement [of Clinton]{.underline}, the
[rearranging]{.underline} of the world [by Bush, or]{.underline} the
[disengagement of Obama. [The world is filled with]{.mark} intractable
[problems. Trump is less interested]{.mark} in [trying to solve
all]{.mark}]{.underline} of them [in a New-York minute [and more]{.mark}
concerned [about **reducing**]{.mark}]{.underline} those [[**problems**
so]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[they give]{.underline}]{.mark} the United
States and its friends and allies [less and [**less
trouble**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Trump is **traveling a path between running**]{.mark} **away [and
invading]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It might be [[called **persistent
presence**. The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[plans to engage and use]{.mark} its
[influence in key parts of the world]{.mark} consistently over time to
protect our interests. Done consistently, [it will]{.mark} not only
protect our interests; it will]{.underline} also [[**expand** the
**global safe space**]{.mark} by [causing bad influences to
fade.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Recent activities in the Middle East are a good example. The [bomb
[strike on Syria was not]{.mark} a [prelude to regime change]{.mark} or
nation-building]{.underline} in Syria. [[It was a **warning
shot**]{.underline}]{.mark} to Assad [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} cut it
out and [[stop interfering in]{.mark} U.S. [efforts to
**finish**]{.mark} **off [ISIS,]{.mark}** **[stabilize refugee]{.mark}
population[s]{.mark}** and [**keep Iraq from falling apart**. Engagement
with Egypt was to **signal** America is]{.mark} back [**working with
partners** to **stabilize**]{.mark} the region [and
**counter**]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**twin threats** of]{.underline}
Islamist [**[extremism]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[Iran]{.underline}**]{.mark}[. Neither is a kick-ass-and-withdraw
operation. [These are signs of]{.mark} **long**, [**serious
engagement**, **shrinking**]{.mark} **the [space]{.mark}** in which
[**bad actors** can **operate**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Congress bad---slow, wrong interests, divided. 

**Howell & Moe 16** - Professor in American Politics at the University
of Chicago & Professor of Political Science at Stanford \[William Howell
& Terry Moe, Relic: How Our Constitution Undermines Effective
Government\--and Why We Need a More Powerful Presidency, Basic Books,
2016\]

American government is dysfunctional, and anyone tuned in to politics
sees evidence of it every day. [[As a decision-maker, **Congress is
inexcusably bad**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [It is [**immobilized**,
**impotent**, and **utterly incapable** of]{.mark} taking
[responsible]{.mark}, [effective action]{.mark} on behalf of the
nation]{.underline}. So why is this happening? The most common view is
that Congress's problems are due to the polarization of the Republican
and Democratic Parties over the last few decades. By this rendering, if
the nation could just move toward a more moderate brand of
politics---say, by reforming primary elections or campaign
finance---Congress could get back to the way it functioned in the good
old days, when it (allegedly) did a fine job of making public policy.
And then all would be well.1 But this just isn't so. [**Polarization**
has]{.underline} surely [been detrimental to American
government]{.underline}. Yet even if the political conditions of the
good old days could somehow be re-created, it is wrong to think that
Congress would then function admirably. The brute reality is that [the
good old days were not good.]{.underline} [With relatively few
exceptions, [Congress has **always been incapable of crafting effective
policy responses**]{.mark} **to the nation's problems**]{.underline}.2
**[[Congress's]{.mark} most [fundamental
inadequacies]{.mark}]{.underline}** are not due to polarization. Nor are
they of recent vintage. **[They [are baked into the
institution]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Congress is]{.mark} an
**[irresponsible]{.mark}**, ineffective policymaker largely **[because
it is wired]{.mark} to be [that way]{.mark}**---and its wiring is **[due
to]{.mark} its [constitutional design]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The
Constitution ensures that [[members]{.mark} of Congress [are
**electorally tied** to]{.mark} their local jurisdictions]{.underline},
that they are [highly responsive to **special interests** and **narrow
constituencies**]{.underline}, and that these forces---which we will
refer to, summarily, as **[[parochial
forces]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[profoundly shape their approach to
policy]{.underline}. Congress as a whole reflects the parochialism of
its members. [It is [**not wired** to solve]{.mark} **national
problems** in the national interest]{.underline}. It is wired to allow
hundreds of parochial legislators to promote their own political welfare
through special-interest politics. And that is what they typically do.3
Much as Congress deserves to be everyone's favorite whipping boy, then,
[its pathologies are not really of its own making]{.underline}. They are
rooted in the Constitution, and it is the Constitution that is the
fundamental problem. The pathologies that the Constitution creates,
moreover, are not limited to Congress. They extend to the entire system
of governance. This happens, in no small part, because the Constitution
puts Congress right at the center of the system by granting it the
authority to make the laws, and its pathologies inevitably infect every
other niche and component of government. Congress is not just one of
three branches of government. The founders made Congress---and all the
localism and special interests it channels---the first branch of
government, expecting it to be the most important and consequential,
with the second (the executive) and third (the judiciary) fully expected
to trail behind. These system-wide problems are considerably worsened by
the very hallmark of the Constitution's approach to democratic
governance: its much-celebrated separation of powers. The founders
embraced separation of powers some 225 years ago, when the nation was a
simple agrarian society of roughly four million people. Government was
not expected to do much, and the founders---mainly worried about
avoiding "tyranny of the majority" and other populist excesses---
purposely designed a government that couldn't do much. Separation of
powers was their structural means of accomplishing that. Its myriad
checks and balances made governmental action very difficult and thus
stacked the deck in favor of the status quo. This approach to governance
may have been fine for a simple agrarian society in the late 1700s. Or
maybe not. Whatever the case, that time is long gone and it isn't coming
back. 4 Americans today inhabit a profoundly different world. The United
States of the twenty-first century is an exceedingly modern,
postindustrial, highly interconnected, technologically advanced,
fast-changing country that is awash in serious social problems--- from
terrorism to pollution to drugs to poverty, and on and on--- that
government is fully expected to address and try to resolve. Modern
society also generates, quite inevitably, all sorts of basic social
needs--- for economic growth, a stable money supply, transportation
systems, health care, retirement, education, and much more--- that the
government is called upon to deal with, and that can readily become
serious problems if they are not handled well. In today's times, these
issues are very real, very pressing, and very consequential--- and
government must act, and act effectively, if it is to protect and
promote the well-being of the nation. How it should act, of course, is a
matter of partisan and ideological controversy. Liberals tend to favor
top-down programs run by the government itself, and they tend to favor
higher levels of spending and taxes. Conservatives are more likely to
favor governmental approaches designed to give private-sector actors the
incentives to mitigate the problems at hand, and they tend to favor
lower levels of spending and taxes. Yet most conservatives and liberals
can agree that--- while their favored approaches differ markedly---
government needs to take some sort of action in addressing the nation's
major problems, and it needs to do so effectively. Whatever the policy
approach, money should be spent wisely and efficiently, and problems
should actually get solved. American government lacks the capacity to do
these things. Part of the reason, of course, is that separation of
powers makes it difficult for government to act. Ours is a system of
government in which power is parceled out, authority is divided, and the
various branches of government, quite by design, are set against one
another. But there is more to the government's incapacity than even this
conveys. As we'll explain in the chapters to follow, the same
constitutional wiring ensures that, when government does act, it tends
to produce weak, cobbled-together, patchwork policies that lack
coherence and are not effective. To make matters worse, even when those
policies are shown--- through actual experience--- to be ineffective and
greatly in need of fixing, they typically do not get fixed; they tend to
live on despite their manifest inadequacies, creating an ever-growing
conglomeration of programs that don't solve society's problems but
continue to soak up society's resources. 5 We can't blame the founders
for any of this. They had no idea what modern society would look like,
what its problems would be, or what kind of government might be
appropriate for the modern era. They weren't clairvoyant. Indeed, they
knew they weren't--- and they assumed that, as society changed over time
in whatever ways, future generations would change the Constitution to
meet new and evolving needs. 6 But for the most part, future generations
didn't do that. The Constitution--- again, due to its original design---
has proven difficult to amend, and fundamental changes to the
organization of government have mostly been off the table. The upshot is
that the United States of today is burdened with a government designed
for a bygone era. The times have radically changed, but the core of the
Constitution--- separation of powers, with a parochial Congress at its
center--- has not, leaving the nation with a government that is out of
sync with the society it is supposed to be governing. It is a relic of
the past. Most of this book is devoted to explaining why this is so. The
connection between the Constitution and ineffective government is not on
the public's radar screen, and it needs to be. Huge majorities distrust
the federal government these days. Many are sharply critical of the
president. And Congress is regarded with thinly veiled contempt. 7 But
the Constitution? It is above the fray--- and above criticism, embraced
with the kind of abiding reverence usually associated with religion.
Public officials do bad things. The government does bad things. But the
Constitution is good. And if the government and its officials fail the
nation in various ways--- which they do, regularly--- then it is their
fault, not the Constitution's. Viewing the Constitution as beyond
criticism is a big mistake. The Constitution is an antiquated document,
imposed on modern America from the distant past, and it has enormous
consequences for how the nation is governed, for how well it functions,
and for countless important aspects of our everyday lives. There should
be nothing off-limits about exploring the Constitution's impacts. These
are matters of objective fact, and they need to be studied, assessed,
and openly debated if Americans are to have a clear sense of why their
government is disappointing them and what can be done about it. This
book is our attempt to encourage new thinking along these lines. We
don't want to stop, however, with an analysis that points to the
Constitution as a fundamental source of ineffective government. We also
want to take the next step and consider what can be done about it. What
can the nation do to bring its government into sync with modern times?
If we allow ourselves to pursue pie-in-the-sky alternatives, the
possibilities are many. These would include the most obvious option: a
parliamentary system--- which is the form of government that prevails,
with some variation, in every developed democracy but our own. 8 A
reasonable case can be made that if the United States could design a new
government from scratch, a parliamentary system of some kind would be
superior to the separation-of-powers system our nation is burdened with
now. It is not an accident that the countries of Europe and Scandinavia
did not follow America's constitutional lead and that the new
democracies of Eastern Europe, which formed in the 1990s, didn't either.
As a practical matter, however, there is no chance that the United
States is ever going to adopt a parliamentary system--- or in any
fundamental fashion, do away with separation of powers--- as such a
transformation would require a wholesale rewriting of the Constitution.
So there is no point, here in this book, in considering these as live
possibilities or assessing their merits. At the other end of the
spectrum are reforms that might be doable, such as those that we
mentioned earlier, like addressing party primaries or campaign finance.
But while these are much discussed nowadays, and while they surely
direct attention to obvious problems afflicting American politics, they
don't get to the most fundamental source of ineffective government,
which is the Constitution. In our view, the best path to major
improvement is a middle course between these two extremes: a course that
is pragmatic because it is within the realm of possibility, but also
takes direct aim at the fundamentals that most need to be addressed. The
problem is that the nation is burdened with an outdated Constitution.
The solution is to update it. As we will show, this can be done in a way
that is exceedingly simple, is low in risk, and leaves almost the
entirety of the Constitution still in place--- including separation of
powers--- but nonetheless promises to have great payoffs for effective
government. What we're suggesting, stated most generally, is a simple
reform that makes Congress less central to the legislative process and
presidents more central. The rationale for diluting Congress's
importance is straightforward. Congress is wired to behave in ways that
undermine effective government, and as a practical matter, nothing much
can be done about that. Its members are rooted in their states and
districts, they are wide open to special-interest influence, they are
concerned about their own political welfare, and with rare exceptions
they are collectively incapable of rising above their parochialism and
fragmentation to craft truly effective policies for the nation. That
being so, the path to effective government requires moving Congress from
the front seat of legislative policymaking to the back seat, where its
pathologies can do less damage. 9 [The nation is **far better off with
presidents in the front seat**]{.underline}. Just as legislators are
wired to behave in certain distinctive ways, so are
[presidents]{.underline}---but their [wiring is]{.underline} very, very
[different, and it]{.underline} actually [propels them to be **champions
of effective government**]{.underline}. [This is true regardless of
whether the presidents are Republicans or Democrats, conservatives or
liberals, insiders or outsiders]{.underline}. All presidents share
basically the same wiring, and they can be counted upon to behave in the
same basic ways. [Crucial features set presidents apart]{.underline}
from members of Congress. The [first]{.underline} is that [presidents
are **truly national leaders** with national constituencies who think in
national terms about national problems]{.underline}---and [they are far
less likely]{.underline} than legislators [to become captive
to]{.underline} narrow or [local]{.underline} special-interest
[pressures]{.underline}. They are politicians. They are not perfect.
Their policy agendas won\'t please everyone. [But [compared to]{.mark}
members of [Congress, **they are paragons of**]{.mark} **national
[leadership]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Second]{.underline}, presidents
occupy the highest office in the land, having reached the pinnacle not
only of their careers but of their entire lives---and as a result,
invariably, [[they are]{.mark} **strongly [motivated]{.mark}** [by
concerns about their **legacies**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Their legacies,
in turn, are ultimately [defined]{.underline}---by historians, most
notably---not on the basis of day-to-day public opinion or short-term
events but rather [[on the basis of **demonstrated success**]{.mark}
**in [crafting durable, effective policy]{.mark}
solutions**]{.underline} [to important national problems]{.underline}.
Members of [Congress are not driven by such lofty concerns]{.underline}.
[They are]{.underline} famously [**myopic**, **incremental**, and
**parochial**; they **think about the next election**; and they use
policies for short-term and often local advantage]{.underline}.
[Third]{.underline}, presidents are chief executives motivated and
positioned to provide a coherent approach to the whole of government,
whereas Congress can provide nothing of the sort. Its hundreds of
members are mainly concerned about the various parts of government that
matter to them as parochial politicians. [Congress takes a piecemeal
approach]{.underline} to the countless separate policies, programs, and
agencies of government while presidents care about the entire corpus of
government and about making it work. [For these reasons, [presidents are
**wired to be the nation\'s problem-solvers**]{.mark}]{.underline} in
chief and [to use the powers of their leadership to **promote effective
government**.]{.underline} They have great difficulty, how- ever,
following through on these motivations. The Constitution sees to
it---purposely, by design---that they are significantly limited in the
formal powers they wield and heavily constrained by the checks and
balances formally imposed by the other branches, par- ticularly
Congress. [Presidents cannot require Congress to act]{.underline}, they
don\'t control the legislative process, [they can\'t determine the con-
tent of public policy]{.underline}---and the nation, as a result, is
saddled with a constitutional system that makes it virtually impossible
to take advantage of what presidents have to offer as the champions of
effective government. [Something needs to be done about
that.]{.underline} Fortunately, this chal- lenge can be met without a
radical transformation of the Consti- tution and a risky leap into the
unknown. Under the reform we\'re proposing, the Constitution remains
basically the same. So does Congress. So does separation of powers. The
reform involves a simple, straightforward constitutional amendment that
changes the way policy decisions get made: giving presidents broad and
permanent agenda-setting power, and thereby moving Congress to the back
seat of policymaking and presidents to the front.

#### Executive power and flexibility is more decisive, qualified, effective, and accountable than Congress\-\--they're beholden to special interest groups and can't make decisions

David **Brooks 13**, a New York Times Op-Ed columnist, writes about
politics, culture and the social sciences, "Strengthen the Presidency,"
12/12/2013, New York Times,
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/13/opinion/brooks-strengthen-the-presidency.html

[[After a law is passed]{.mark}, [there are always adjustments]{.mark}
to be made]{.underline}. [[These could be done
flexibly]{.underline}]{.mark}. But, [[instead]{.mark}, [Congress throws
implementation and enforcement into the court system]{.mark} by [giving
more groups]{.mark} the [standing to sue]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**[What
could be]{.mark} a [flexible]{.mark} process [is turned]{.mark} into
"[adversarial legalism]{.mark}"** [that makes government]{.mark} more
[intrusive and]{.mark} more [rigid]{.mark}]{.underline}. Fukuyama
describes what you might call the demotion of Pennsylvania Avenue.
Legislative activity could once be understood by what happens at either
end of that street. But now [power is dispersed among the mass of
rentier groups]{.underline}. [Members of [Congress]{.mark} lead lives
they don't want to lead because they [are **beholden to**]{.mark} **the
[groups]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The president is hemmed in by this new
industry, interest group capitalism]{.underline}. [The unofficial
pressure sector dominates the official governing sector]{.underline}.
[Throw in political polarization and you've got a recipe for a
government that is more stultified, stagnant and
overbearing]{.underline}. Fukuyama ultimately throws up his hands.
Things would be better, he observes, if we had a more unified
parliamentary system, with more administrative discretion. But we don't.
"So we have a problem." But **[there is a way out: Make the executive
branch more powerful]{.underline}**. [This is a **good moment** to
advocate greater executive branch power]{.underline} because we've just
seen a monumental example of executive branch incompetence: the botched
Obamacare rollout. It's important to advocate greater executive branch
power in a chastened mood. It's not that the executive branch is
trustworthy; it's just that [we're **better off** when the presidency is
strong than we are when the rentier groups are strong, or when
**Congress**, which is now **completely captured** by the rentier
groups, is strong]{.underline}. Here are the advantages. First, [[it is
possible to mobilize the executive]{.mark} branch to come [to policy
conclusion]{.mark}]{.underline} on something like immigration reform.
**[[It's nearly impossible for Congress to lead]{.mark} us to a
[conclusion about anything]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Second,
[[executive]{.mark} branch [officials are]{.mark} **more [sheltered
from]{.mark} the [interest groups]{.mark} than Congressional
officials**]{.underline}. Third, [executive branch officials usually
[have more **specialized knowledge**]{.mark} than staffers on Capitol
Hill [and longer]{.mark} historical [memories]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Fourth, [Congressional deliberations, to the extent they exist at all,
are rooted in rigid political frameworks]{.underline}. Some agencies,
especially places like the Office of Management and Budget, are
reasonably removed from excessive partisanship. Fifth,
[[executive]{.mark} branch [officials]{.mark}, [if]{.mark} they were
[liberated from rigid Congressional strictures]{.mark}, [would have more
discretion to **respond to**]{.mark} **their
[screw-ups]{.mark}**]{.underline}, like the Obamacare implementation.
Finally, [[the nation can take it out on a president's party
when]{.mark} a president's [laws don't work]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[That
**doesn't happen in Congressional elections**]{.mark}, where most have
safe seats]{.underline}. So how do you energize the executive? [It's a
good idea to [be tolerant of executive]{.mark} branch [power
grabs]{.mark} and to **[give agencies
flexibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We voters also need to change our
voting criteria. It's not enough to vote for somebody who agrees with
your policy preferences. Presidential candidates need to answer two
questions. How are you going to build a governing 60 percent majority
that will enable you to drive the Washington policy process? What is
your experience implementing policies through big organizations?

In order to weigh the advantages of the Congress-first approach, it is
also important to understand its potential costs. The costs may not be
obvious, since grounding the use of force in ex ante congressional
consent bears a close resemblance to the process for enacting
legislation. [[The legislative process]{.mark} increases]{.underline}
the [costs of government action. It [is heavily slanted
**against**]{.mark} **the [enactment of legislation]{.mark}** [by
requiring]{.mark} the [concurrence]{.mark}]{.underline} [not just [of
the]{.mark} popularly elected [House]{.mark} but also the
state-representing [Senate and]{.mark} the
[President.]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[This raises decision costs by
**[increasing]{.mark}** the **[delay]{.mark}** needed to get legislative
concurrence, requiring an effort to coordinate between executive and
legislature, [and]{.mark} [demanding]{.mark} an **open,
[public]{.mark}** [discussion of]{.mark} potentially **[sensitive
information]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Decision costs are not encapsulated
merely in the time-worn hypotheticals that ask whether the President
must go to Congress for permissions to launch a preemptive strike
against a nation about to launch its own nuclear attack. Rather, these
[[decision costs]{.mark} might [arise from delay in using force that
**misses a window of opportunity,** or]{.mark} one in [which legislative
discussion alerts an enemy]{.mark} [to]{.mark} a possible
[attack]{.mark}, or the uncertainty over whether congressional
authorization will be forthcoming.]{.underline}

#### Congress is too slow to respond to 21^st^ century threats \-\-- executive deference is critical

Andrew **Rudalevige 6**, the Thomas Brackett Reed Professor of
Government @ Bowdoin College, "The New Imperial Presidency," UMich-Ann
Arbor Press, Book, p. 264-67

That [fragmentation is]{.underline} most [obvious at the other end of
Pennsylvania Avenue.]{.underline} Despite common grammatical usage,
including in this book, [[Congress is not an "it" but a
"they.]{.mark}"]{.underline} That is, [Congress is]{.underline} not
singular but plural and [a fractious plural]{.underline} at that. [The
geographic basis of House representation]{.underline}--- the
"territorial imperative"---[means that [no two House members
share]{.mark} identical [interests]{.mark}.]{.underline}6 The
[distinctive constituencies]{.underline} and terms of the House and
Senate [generate few overlapping sympathies across the
chambers.]{.underline} Sequential majorities and [[**supermajorities**
are required for action, but only a **small minority** for
inaction.]{.underline}]{.mark} This became even more true after the
application of reforms in the 1970s designed to apply the openness and
decentralization aimed at the executive branch to Congress itself. The
reforms enhanced the power of subcommittees and gave party rank-and-‹le
more power to override seniority in selecting committee chairs. What
nineteenth-century observers like Woodrow Wilson condemned as "committee
government" often atomized further into "subcommittee government"
instead. As a result, one scholar noted, members of Congress can make
laws "only with sweat patience, and a remarkable skill in the handling
of creaking machinery." But stopping laws is a feat "they perform daily,
with ease and infinite variety."7¶ Thus [even an alert and aggressive
Congress has endemic weaknesses.]{.underline}8 [[Its large size
and]{.mark} relative lack of [hierarchy]{.mark} [hamper]{.mark} **[quick
decision making]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The specialized jurisdictions
inherent in [the committee system]{.underline}, so necessary for
dividing labor, also [divide issues and make their comprehensive
consideration across functional lines nearly impossible.]{.underline}
(Nor do House members' two-year terms give much incentive for long-term
planning.) For similar reasons [Congress has difficulty in planning and
agenda setting.]{.underline} The ready acceptance of the idea of a
presidential legislative program after World War II was partly a
question of legislative convenience, a way to weed through innumerable
proposals and provide a focus for limited floor time. Finally, [with so
many members, each seeking press attention, Congress also finds it hard
to **keep a secret.**]{.underline} As President George H. W. Bush's
counsel, Boyden Gray, put it, ["**any time you notify Congress, it's
like putting an ad in the Washington Post. Notification is tantamount to
declaration**.]{.underline}"9¶ In short, Congress has the problems
inherent to any body of individuals that must take collective action.
The decisions that are rational for a single member---especially those
aimed at gaining particular benefits for his or her district---are not
always good decisions for the body as a whole.10 James Madison wrote as
early as 1791 that whenever a question of "general. . . advantage to the
Union was before the House . . . \[members\] commonly resorted to local
views." Then, as now, coalition building had to overcome decentralized
inertia, with the result that governing often comes down to, in the
words of LBJ budget official Charles Schultze, "a lot of boodle being
handed out in large numbers of small boodle."11¶ Worse, fragmentation is
not limited to the legislative branch. After all, Congress created most
of the executive branch as well---and in its own image. The "politics of
bureaucratic structure" result in a bureaucracy far different than what
organization theorists would draw up on a blank page, one rarely aligned
along functional lines or with clear lines of executive authority.
Legislative majorities hope to institutionalize their own interests in
government agencies and to structurally insulate those preferences
against future majorities seeking to meddle. They hope to gain access to
the bureaucratic decision-making process and to influence it whenever
desirable. They hope to gain points with constituents for fixing the
errors agencies make, perhaps to the point of structuring agencies that
cannot help but make errors. If nothing else, the historical pattern of
executive branch development has spurred a particular array of
legislative committees---and organized special interests linked to
both.12¶ As the size and scope of the national government grew, its
organizational inefficiencies became more obvious and more meaningful.
This in turn focused increased attention on the need for direction and
coordination--- for a chief executive who could actually manage the
executive branch. The areas of homeland security and intelligence
analysis are only the most recent cases where failures of communication
or analysis within the bureaucracy have magnified the need for those
qualities.¶ Globalization in some ways highlights the continuing limits
of the presidency's authority: its incumbent is not, after all,
president of the world. Yet [the practical [advantages of presidential
leadership vis-à-vis the legislature]{.mark}]{.underline}, at least,
[[are]{.mark} further [**magnified** in an era where]{.mark} rapid
transportation, instantaneous communication, and huge flows of trade
have changed the context of governance in ways that play to presidential
strengths. Both opportunities and [**threats arise quickly and demand
immediate response.** Their resolution requires]{.mark} a broad national
view, not territorialism; resident [expertise, not]{.mark} the
give-and-take of log-rolling [compromise]{.mark}.]{.underline} Further,
if, as Richard Neustadt suggested, [the cold war's omnipresent fear of
nuclear war made the president for a time the "final arbiter" in the
balance of power, the [rise of rogue states and nonstate actors]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} access to similar [weaponry **ups the ante**]{.mark}
again.]{.underline} In this one sense at least the "modern presidency"
described earlier may have given way to a "postmodern" one.13 As the
Bush administration argued to the Supreme Court on behalf of the
president's power to designate enemy combatants,¶ The court of appeals'
attempt to cabin the Commander-in-Chief authority to the conduct of
combat operations on a traditional battlefield is particularly
ill-considered in the context of the current conflict. . . . The
September 11 attacks not only struck targets on United States soil; they
also were launched from inside the Nation's borders. The "full power to
repel and defeat the enemy" thus necessarily embraces determining what
measures to take against enemy combatants found within the United
States. As the September 11 attacks make manifestly clear, moreover, al
Qaeda eschews conventional battlefield combat, yet indiicts damage that,
if anything, is more devastating.14

### link -- oversight

#### Congressional oversight crushes war powers

**Kriner '9** (Douglas, Assistant Professor of Political Science, Boston
University, "CAN ENHANCED OVERSIGHT REPAIR "THE BROKEN BRANCH"?,"
<http://www.bu.edu/law/central/jd/organizations/journals/bulr/volume89n2/documents/KRINER.pdf>)

The presumption is widespread that [[through]{.mark}]{.underline}
rigorous [[oversight]{.mark} of the executive]{.underline} branch
[[Congress can maintain]{.underline}]{.mark} a degree of [[influence
over policymaking]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[even in an era of expanded
presidential powers]{.underline}** and broad delegations of authority to
the executive branch. Immediately after the Democratic takeover of both
houses of Congress in 2006, California Congressman Henry Waxman argued
that investigations may be \"just as important, if not more important,
than legislation.\" n75 Similarly, in academic circles Thomas Mann spoke
for many when he argued that the rise of oversight in the 110th Congress
\"has been the most important change since the 2006 election in terms of
relations between the Congress and the administration.\" n76 However,
the precise mechanisms through which oversight alone can influence
executive behavior and the course of policymaking are frequently
ignored. Recommendations by oversight committees are nonbinding and have
no force of law. Congress does have budgetary control over executive
departments and agencies, an important means of leverage. However, as
noted \[\*785\] by skeptics of congressional dominance theories in the
literature on bureaucratic control, budgetary tools are somewhat clumsy
instruments for encouraging greater executive compliance with
legislative intent. n77 Moreover, oversight committees themselves
normally lack appropriations authority, which diminishes the credibility
of any threatened committee sanctions for noncompliance. n78 Indeed, in
most situations an oversight committee\'s only formal recourse is to
propose new legislation that would legally compel a change in course.
However, such efforts are subject to the collective action dilemma and
intricate procedures riddled with transaction costs and
super-majoritarian requirements, not to mention a presidential veto. n79
[If oversight can only constrain executive branch activities through
such formal mechanisms, then there are strong reasons to question
whether it can truly serve as a real constraint on the executive\'s
freedom of action.]{.underline} And if it does not, then oversight is
merely inconsequential position-taking, not a tool for continued
congressional influence over policymaking when legislative options fail.
However, [there are **[strong theoretical]{.mark}** reasons [and]{.mark}
growing **[empirical evidence]{.mark}** to suggest that congressional
[oversight can influence executive branch behavior]{.mark} through more
informal means.]{.underline} Vigorous congressional [[oversight can
**inform policy discourse**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [**[influence public
opinion]{.underline}** **[and bring]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[popular
pressure to bear on the executive]{.mark} to change
course]{.underline}**. In David Mayhew\'s words, members of Congress can
wield considerable influence not only by legislating, but also by
\"making moves\" in what he terms the \"public sphere.\" n80 Surveying
over 200 years of congressional history, [Mayhew identified more than
2300 \"actions]{.underline}\" [members of Congress have
taken]{.underline} in the public sphere in an attempt [to shape the
national policy discourse and mobilize popular opinion.]{.underline} n81
[**[Again and again]{.underline}**, [oversight]{.underline}]{.mark} [and
investigative committee hearings have [served as a **critically
important forum**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in which members]{.mark} of
Congress [take stands]{.mark}]{.underline}, [stake out positions in
contrast to those of the executive branch, **[and battle for
influence]{.mark}** over the attentive public]{.underline}. As a result,
Mayhew argues that \"the politics involving members of Congress needs to
be modeled not just as opinion expression - the custom in political
science analysis - but also as opinion formation.\" n82 \[\*786\] But
can congressional oversight really influence public opinion? After all,
the vast majority of Americans rarely tune to C-SPAN to catch the latest
proceedings from hearing rooms in the Russell or Cannon congressional
buildings. However, [Congress may have an important ally in the mass
media]{.underline}, [which aids them in their quest to reach a broader
audience]{.underline}. A large literature within political
communications suggests that [the media \"indexes\" the scope and tone
of its coverage to the political debate in Washington,]{.underline}
particularly in Congress. n83 Moreover, [many congressional [hearings
are **made-for-television events**]{.mark}]{.underline} and are
consciously designed to generate conflict. [Conflict]{.underline},
according to many journalistic norms, [is inherently
newsworthy]{.underline}, and thus [[the press may play an important role
in **amplifying**]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [congressional challenge to
administration policies]{.mark} and actions]{.underline} and in
broadening the audience such congressional cues reach. n84 A number of
recent studies have found strong empirical evidence that the positions
articulated in Congress may indeed have a considerable influence on
public opinion, particularly in questions of military policy. n85 Many
studies rely on observational data. n86 Matthew [Baum and]{.underline}
Tim [Groeling\'s [research demonstrates]{.mark} [strong correlations
between]{.mark} media-reported **[congressional rhetoric]{.mark}**
[surrounding]{.mark} multiple major [military
missions]{.mark}]{.underline} in the last quarter century
[[and]{.mark}]{.underline} popular [[support]{.mark} for those
endeavors.]{.underline} n87 However, such studies relying exclusively on
observational data usually only demonstrate correlations between
congressional actions and public opinion. If this relationship is
endogenous - that is, if members of Congress respond to public opinion
when crafting their rhetoric and actions even as they seek to lead it -
then raw correlations between the two tell us little about the direction
of the causal \[\*787\] arrow. n88 Is Congress leading public opinion,
or are shifts in public opinion producing changes in congressional
positions?

#### Oversight has zero chance of working but still substantially undermines executive secrecy

**Posner and Vermeule, Chicago and Harvard law professor, 2010**

(Eric and Adrian, Executive Unbound, pg 25-29)

[Many institutional factors hamper effective legislative monitoring of
executive discretion for legal compliance.]{.underline} Consider the
following problems. Information Asymmetries [Monitoring the executive
requires expertise]{.underline} in the area being monitored. In many
cases, [Congress lacks the information necessary to monitor
discretionary policy choices by the executive]{.underline}. [Although
the committee system has the effect]{.underline}, among others, [of
generating legislative information and]{.underline} expertise,18 and
[although Congress has a large internal staff, there are domains in
which no amount of legislative expertise suffices for effective
oversight]{.underline}. [Prime among these are areas of foreign policy
and national security.]{.underline} Here the relative lack of
legislative expertise is only part of the problem; what makes it worse
is that [the legislature lacks the raw information that experts need to
make assessments.]{.underline} The problem would disappear if
legislators could cheaply acquire information from the president, but
they cannot. [One obstacle is a suite of legal doctrines protecting
executive secrecy and creating deliberative privileges]{.underline}---
doctrines that may or may not be justified from some higher-order
systemic point of view as means for producing optimal deliberation
within the executive branch. Although such privileges are waivable, the
executive often fears to set a bad institutional precedent. [Another
obstacle is]{.underline} the standard executive claim [that **Congress
leaks like a sieve**, so that sharing secret information with
legislators will result in public disclosure. The problem]{.underline}
[becomes most acute when, as in]{.underline} the recent controversy over
[**surveillance** by the **N**ational **S**ecurity
**A**gency]{.underline}, [the executive claims]{.underline} that the
very scope or rationale of [a program cannot]{.underline} [be discussed
with Congress, because to do so would violate the very secrecy that
makes the program possible]{.underline} and beneficial. In any
particular case the claim might be right or wrong; legislators have no
real way to judge, and they know that the claim might be made either by
a wellmotivated executive or by an ill-motivated executive, albeit for
very different reasons. Collective Action Problems Part of [what drives
executive reluctance to share information is that, even on select
intelligence committees, some legislator or staffer is bound to
leak]{.underline} and it will be difficult to pinpoint the source. Aware
of the relative safety that the numbers give them, legislative leakers
are all the more bold. This is an example of a larger problem, arising
from the fact that there are many more legislators than top-level
executive officials. Compared to the executive branch, [Congress finds
it more costly to coordinate and to undertake collective action (such as
the detection and punishment of leakers]{.underline}). To be sure, the
executive too is a "they," not an "it." Much of what presidents do is
arbitrate internal conflicts among executive departments and try to
aggregate competing views into coherent policy over time. As a strictly
comparative matter, however, the contrast is striking: the executive can
act with much greater unity, force, and dispatch than can Congress,
which is chronically hampered by the need for debate and consensus among
large numbers. This comparative advantage is a principal reason why
Congress enacts broad delegating statutes in the first place, especially
in domains touching on foreign policy and national security. In these
domains, and elsewhere, the very conditions that make delegation
attractive also hamper congressional monitoring of executive discretion
under the delegation. There may or may not be offsetting advantages to
Congress's large numbers. Perhaps the very size and heterogeneity of
Congress make it a superior deliberator, whereas the executive branch is
prone to suffer from various forms of groupthink. But there are clear
disadvantages to large numbers, insofar as monitoring executive
discretion is at issue. From the standpoint of individual legislators,
[monitoring is a collective good]{.underline}. If rational and
self-interested, [each legislator will attempt to free ride on the
production of this good, and monitoring will be inefficiently
underproduced]{.underline}. More broadly, the institutional prerogatives
of Congress are also a collective good. [Individual legislators may or
may not be interested in protecting the institution of Congress or the
separation of legislative from executive power; much depends on
legislators' time horizons or discount rate]{.underline}, the expected
longevity of a legislative career, and so forth. But it is clear that
protection of legislative prerogatives will be much less emphasized in
an institution composed of hundreds of legislators coming and going than
if Congress were a single person. "Separation of Parties, not Powers"
Congress is, among other things, a partisan institution.19 Political
scientists debate whether it is principally a partisan institution, or
even exclusively so. But Madison arguably did not envision partisanship
in anything like its modern sense[. Partisanship undermines the
separation of powers during periods of unified government. When the same
party controls both the executive branch and Congress, real monitoring
of executive discretion rarely occurs]{.underline}, at any rate far less
than in an ideal Madisonian system. [This appears to have a marked
effect in the domain of war powers]{.underline} and [foreign
affairs]{.underline}, where a recent study by political scientists
William Howell and Jon Pevehouse shows that congressional oversight of
presidential war powers differs markedly depending upon the partisan
composition of Congress.20 When Congress is a co-partisan of the
president, oversight is minimal; when parties differ across branches,
oversight is more vigorous. Partisanship can enhance monitoring during
periods of divided government,21 but this is cold comfort for liberal
legalists. From the standpoint of liberal legalism, monitoring is most
necessary during periods of unified government, because Congress is most
likely to enact broad delegations when the president holds similar
views; and in such periods monitoring is least likely to occur. The
Congress of one period may partially compensate by creating institutions
to ensure bipartisan oversight in future periods--- consider the statute
that gives a minority of certain congressional committees power to
subpoena documents from the executive22---but these are palliatives.
Under unified government, [congressional leaders of the same party as
the president have tremendous power to frustrate effective oversight by
the minority party]{.underline}. The Limits of Congressional
Organization Congress as a collective body has attempted, in part, to
overcome these problems through internal institutional arrangements.
Committees and subcommittees specialize in a portion of the policy
space, such as the armed forces or homeland security, thereby relieving
members of the costs of acquiring and processing information (at least
if the committee itself maintains a reputation for credibility).
Intelligence committees hold closed sessions and police their members to
deter leaks (although the sanctions that members of Congress can apply
to one another are not as strong as the sanctions a president can apply
to a leaker in the executive branch). Large staffs, both for committees
and members, add expertise and monitoring capacity. And interest groups
can sometimes be counted upon to sound an alarm when the executive harms
their interests. Overall, however, these arrangements are not fully
adequate, especially in domains of foreign policy and national security,
where the scale of executive operations is orders of magnitude larger
than the scale of congressional operations. [Congress's whole
staff]{.underline}, [which must]{.underline} (with the help of interest
groups) [monitor all issues, runs to some 30,000 persons]{.underline}.23
[The executive branch has some 2 million civilian
employees]{.underline}, in addition to almost 1.4 million in the active
armed forces.24 [The sheer mismatch between the scale of executive
operations and the congressional capacity for oversight, even aided by
interest groups or by leakers within the bureaucracy, is
daunting]{.underline}. Probably [Congress is **already at**]{.underline}
or near [the **limits of its monitoring capacity**]{.underline} at its
current size and budget

a desirable flexibility for dealing with exceptional contexts involving
political power. . . . Indeed, [advocates of formal legal codification
as a solution to problems of political power sometimes trade too
easily]{.underline} on [an implicit or explicit claim]{.underline} that
[the only alternative to law is force and chaos]{.underline}. Instead,
the alternative to a legal text such as the UN Charter is a world in
which limitations on state use of force are left to debate,
determination, and enforcement through the system of international
relations itself. . . . [[The choice is between]{.underline}]{.mark} the
greater [**[rigidity (and loss of flexibility]{.underline}**)]{.mark}
that tends to come with formal codification [[and the]{.underline}
**[greater flexibility]{.underline}**]{.mark} (and opportunity for
unprincipled exercise of power) that comes from a less text-bound system
of general principles of international relations. ... We should ask, for
example, whether the multilateral military intervention in Kosovo that
eventually took place (or the international intervention that never did
take place in Bosnia) would have been easier to bring about -- and many
more lives have been saved -- had the general norm against state use of
force or the mechanisms by which collective force was mobilized been
left to political debate and practice, rather than being codified into
the form of a strong legal rule embodied in the UN Charter. [[Would a
more flexible interpretation]{.mark} of this principle [have been easier
to achieve if the general "rule" had been left expressed **as a norm
instead of being turned into** a]{.mark}]{.underline} textually
embodied, [formal]{.underline} rule of international
**[[law]{.underline}]{.mark}**? . . . First, the Security Council had to
decide whether the conditions that justified collective deployment of
force were present in the Kosovo context. Second, once the Security
Council failed to come to that conclusion, the further decision had to
be made whether the collective use of force by NATO, not endorsed by the
Security Council, nonetheless complied with the Charter. ... Would
collective action to stop the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo have emerged
more quickly had the codified provisions of the UN Charter not stood in
the way? \[Update: I believe roughly a year was spent debating the
intervention, including its legality\] It is impossible to know, given
the relationship between material national self-interest and rule-of-law
like considerations in the actions and discourse of states in this area.
Would the arguments against intervention have been considered less
forceful if the rules of the Charter had not been codified in text but
instead existed as softer principles of international relations? [If
[codification]{.mark} of]{.underline} these [rules against]{.underline}
the [use of]{.underline} collective [force]{.underline} (except with
Security Council authorization, and even then, for perhaps only limited
purposes), **[[contributed to inaction or delay]{.underline}]{.mark}**
in any of these humanitarian contexts in recent years, [[that would be a
**serious cost of legal formalization**]{.underline}]{.mark} that must
be taken into account. Again, remember that [[we are dealing
with]{.underline}]{.mark} relatively **[[exceptional, singular
contexts]{.underline}]{.mark}**. . . . There is a critical question of
whether legalization of norms has, as a dark side, the reduction in
flexible interpretation of the underlying norms in new contexts. [We
ought not to preclude that debate by an overly simple assumption that
more law, or more legalization, is always to the good]{.underline}.
Perhaps the advantages of general, written rules, despite how over-or
under-inclusive they might be -- justifies this loss of flexibility;
perhaps the relevant actors are likely to be just as appropriately
flexible with law as they are with norms. But we need to consider these
questions before simply assuming that legalization, clarity, and textual
commitment are unadorned virtues.

### link booster -- prez fights plan

#### The President has institutional incentives to resist encroachments on authority even if he [agrees with the policy -- the perm ensures a fight]{.underline}

Eric **Posner 8**, and Adrian Vermeule, \*professor of law at the
University of Chicago \*\*professor of law at Harvard, Constitutional
Showdowns, 156 U. Pa. L. Rev. 991, lexis

[[In many]{.underline}]{.mark} historical [[cases, Congress and the
President **agree about the policy** outcome but **disagree about lines
of authority**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, suppose that the
executive branch has made a controversial decision, and a suspicious
Congress wants the relevant executive officials to testify about their
role in that decision. The President believes that Congress has no right
to compel the officials to testify, whereas Congress believes that it
has such a right. However, the President, in fact, does not mind if the
officials testify because he believes that their testimony will reveal
that the decision was made in good faith and for good reasons.
\[\*1016\] [[The President\'s problem is that]{.underline}]{.mark}, if
he allows the officials to testify, [[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} and
the public [[might interpret his acquiescence as recognition that
Congress has the power to **force executive
officials**]{.underline}]{.mark} to testify. If he refuses to allow the
officials to testify, then he preserves his claim of executive privilege
but loses the opportunity to show that the decision was made in good
faith. In addition, he risks provoking a constitutional impasse in which
Congress could eventually prevail - if, as we have discussed, public
constitutional sentiment turns out to reject executive privilege in
these circumstances. Congress faces similar dilemmas, for example, when
it approves of officials nominated by the President for an agency or
commission but wants to assert the power in general to impose
restrictions on appointments. [[Political agents]{.underline}]{.mark}
have long [[relied on a middle way]{.mark} to avoid]{.underline} the two
extremes of [acquiescence]{.underline}, on the one hand, [and
impasse]{.underline}, on the other. [[They acquiesce in the
decision]{.underline}]{.mark} made by the other agent [[while
claiming]{.mark} that their acquiescence does not establish a
precedent]{.underline}. Or, equivalently, they argue [that their
[acquiescence was a matter of **comity** rather than **submission to
authority**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Are such claims credible? Can one
avoid the precedential effect of an action by declaring that it does not
establish a precedent - in effect, engaging in \"ambiguous
acquiescence\"? The answer to this question is affirmative as long as
the alternative explanation for the action is in fact credible. If, for
example, observers agree that the President benefits from the testimony
of executive officials, then his acquiescence to a congressional
subpoena has two equally plausible explanations: that he independently
benefits from the testimony, or that he believes that public
constitutional sentiment rejects executive privilege. The response is
thus ambiguous, and Congress may be no wiser about what will happen in
the future when the President does not wish to permit officials to
testify because their testimony would harm him or executive branch
processes. If so, the ambiguous nature of the action does not establish
a focal point that avoids an impasse in the future. On the other hand,
if the President\'s claim that he benefits from the testimony is
obviously false, then his authority will be accordingly diminished. This
is why ambiguous acquiescence is not a credible strategy when the
President and Congress disagree about the policy outcome. If the
President thinks the war should continue, Congress thinks the war should
end, and the President acquiesces to a statute that terminates the war,
then he can hardly argue that he is acting out of comity. He could only
be acting because he lacks power. But an agent can lack authority in
more complicated settings where no serious \[\*1017\] policy conflict
exists. If the President makes officials available for testimony every
time Congress asks for such testimony, and if the testimony usually or
always damages the President, then his claim to be acting out of comity
rather than lack of authority eventually loses its credibility. Repeated
ambiguous acquiescence to repeated claims over time will eventually be
taken as unambiguous acquiescence and hence a loss of authority. For
this reason, [[a President who **cares about maintaining his
constitutional powers will**]{.underline} ]{.mark}need to
**[[refuse]{.underline}]{.mark}** to allow people to testify even when
testimony would be in his short-term interest.

Prepares to Defy Efforts to Limit Obama's Options for Guantanamo,
www.propublica.org/article/administration-prepares-to-defy-efforts-to-limit-obamas-options-for-guantan

Obama [[administration officials]{.mark} say they plan to **[reject
Congressional efforts to limit the president\'s options]{.mark} on
Guantanamo**]{.underline}[, [**setting the stage for a confrontation**
between the president and]{.underline}]{.mark} the new
[[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} [[on an issue that has been
**politically divisive**]{.mark} since]{.underline}
[Inauguration]{.underline} Day.¶ The Guantanamo [provisions,
which]{.underline} include [limit]{.underline}s on [where and how
prisoners can be tried]{.underline}, were attached to a spending bill
for military pay and benefits approved by Congress late last year. Some
Administration officials are recommending that President Obama sign the
spending bill and then issue a "signing statement" challenging at least
some of the Guantanamo provisions as intrusions on his constitutional
authority. Others have recommended that he express opposition to the
Guantanamo sections without addressing their constitutionality.¶ The
statement, officials said, would likely be released along with a new
executive order that outlined review procedures for some \-- but not all
\-- of the 174 Guantanamo prisoners still held without charge or trial.¶
Obama has used signing statements in the past, but this one would carry
political significance as the first test of his relationship with a
Congress in which the House is firmly in Republican control.¶ Officials
said the White House is still weighing how to calibrate the signing
statement. A statement rejecting all of the bill\'s Guantanamo
provisions would almost certainly be viewed as provocative by
Congressional Republicans and some Democrats. But [administration
[officials view the provisions as]{.mark} **clear**
**[encroachments]{.mark}**]{.underline} **[[on the president\'s right
to]{.mark} prosecutorial [discretion]{.mark}]{.underline}** and some are
pushing for their blanket repudiation.¶ The reliance on detention orders
and a signing statement \-- tools used repeatedly by former President
Bush, who built Guantanamo nearly a decade ago \-- is seen by Obama\'s
advisers as among the few options left for an administration that has
watched the steady erosion of its first White House pledge nearly two
years ago: to close the prison.¶ \"There is obviously an irony here,\"
said one Obama administration official, \"but if we resort to this, it
is to close Guantanamo, not keep it open.\"¶ While the signing statement
and the executive order would leave some room for Obama, they would do
little to bring his policy goals to fruition. Over the last two years,
Congress and the administration, working separately and in conflict,
have woven together a complicated set of categories, policies and
restrictions that make it difficult, if not impossible, to close
Guantanamo.¶ What the White House once saw as bipartisan support for
shuttering the prison soon became a bipartisan effort to thwart the
administration\'s plans.¶ The spending measure effectively bars the
president from prosecuting any detainees in federal court or conducting
military commission trials on U.S. soil. The bill makes it increasingly
difficult to transfer detainees to foreign countries, even if the
administration deems them safe to release. And it complicates the review
process Obama plans in the executive order for nearly 50 detainees the
administration has designated as too dangerous to free.¶ A small circle
of policymakers and lawyers from the White House, the Justice Department
and State Department spent the closing hours of 2010 considering drafts
for a statement. A number of administration officials who discussed the
internal deliberations declined to be identified because they were not
authorized to speak on this subject.¶ They said the statement could
amount to a presidential intent to disregard some, but not all, of the
provisions relating to Guantanamo detainees. Under consideration are
claims that the provisions amount to \"undue infringement\" on the
president\'s authority to exercise prosecutorial discretion, or that
they are viewed by the White House as an \"unnecessary and unwarranted
intrusion,\" on that power.¶ Several advisers were pushing for a broader
statement that would also take issue with provisions related to detainee
transfers. Obama has twice issued signing statements claiming that
legislative provisions interfered with his constitutional authority to
conduct foreign relations and could do so again. But there is some
concern that the White House is on less firm ground in that area. The
bill, while making future transfers difficult, does not ban them
outright.¶ \"There is an honest debate right now, centered primarily
inside the White House Counsel\'s office, and among a number of top
staff,\" said one official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
\"The question is: Can we work with some of this stuff and, if not, how
sharply do we make that point.\"¶ The president could veto the spending
bill. But officials said the White House will not block legislation on
military pay and benefits, especially after the military\'s support for
repealing \"Don\'t Ask, Don\'t Tell,\" legislation in December.
Spokesmen at the White House and the National Security Council did not
respond to requests for comment.¶ The White House has, until now, balked
at confrontation even as it watched its policy options dwindle. Not one
administration official who spoke about the internal deliberations could
say for sure whether the White House, in moving to protect the right to
prosecute detainees in federal court, would in fact use it.¶ \"[All
[presidents want to preserve]{.mark} **[maneuverability and]{.mark}**
**[authority]{.mark}**]{.underline}, that is natural,\"
[[said]{.underline}]{.mark} Elisa [[Massimino]{.mark}, president of the
civil rights organization Human Rights First. \"]{.underline}But
President Obama has had the authority to move prisoners to the United
States, he\'s done the background work to identify people to bring to
justice and he\'s squandered the opportunities to exercise that
authority. [[It is striking to now see a **fiercer desire to preserve
authority than to use it**]{.mark}**,\"**]{.underline} she said.

**WSJ 10**, citing DOJ senior ethicist and Associate Deputy Attorney
David Margolis, "Vindicating John Yoo",
https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704757904575078182303405948

So [[after **five years of investigation**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[**partisan accusations** and **unethical media leaks**]{.underline},
[[the]{.mark} [Justice Department\'s **senior
ethicist**]{.mark}]{.underline} [has [concluded]{.mark} that Bush
Administration lawyers John [Yoo]{.mark} and Jay Bybee [committed **no
professional misconduct**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The issue now is whether
the proteges of Attorney General Eric Holder who led this exercise at
Justice\'s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) should themselves
be in the dock. That\'s our reading of the analysis by Associate Deputy
Attorney General David Margolis, a career official who reviewed both the
Bush-era legal memos on interrogating terror suspects and their review
by the lawyers at OPR. Remarkably, [his report is far more scathing
about OPR than it is about]{.underline} Messrs.
[[Yoo]{.underline}]{.mark} and Bybee, [who he says [made legal
errors]{.mark} but did so [in good faith]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[out of
honest legal analysis,]{.mark} and in the ethical service of their
clients in the executive branch]{.underline} at a time of war. Mr.
Margolis\'s review overrules both a draft OPR report whose contents were
leaked to the media last year and a final OPR report that was released
along with the Margolis review late Friday. Those OPR reports
recommended disciplinary action and potential disbarment for Messrs.
Bybee and Yoo for their advice while working in the Office of Legal
Counsel in the frantic months after September 11. [The [leaks
were]{.mark} themselves an [**unethical attempt** to smear]{.mark} the
[reputations of]{.mark} the [lawyers]{.mark} while they were under a gag
order and unable to reply.]{.underline} House Judiciary Chairman John
Conyers nonetheless leapt to praise Friday\'s release of earlier drafts,
touting them as evidence that the OLC memos were \"legally flawed and
fundamentally unsound.\" Senate Judiciary Chairman Pat Leahy promptly
called for Judge Bybee to resign from the federal bench. Both Democrats
have scheduled more grandstanding, er, hearings, for the coming days.
Justice is defending its pre-weekend document dump by saying that it had
to release the entire record. But notably, Justice failed to release a
14-page January 19, 2009 letter from then-Attorney General Michael
Mukasey and Deputy AG Mark Filip that eviscerated the first OPR draft.
The Mukasey-Filip memo has since appeared on media Web sites, and its
withering analysis clearly made an impression on Mr. Margolis. The
selective disclosure by Mr. Holder suggests the political nature of this
entire exercise. \-\-- Readers can review the documents for themselves,
but two OPR judgments deserve particular scorn. The first is the claim
that Messrs. Yoo and Bybee were so close to their client, i.e., the
White House, that they knew what the President and CIA wanted to hear.
But it is perfectly appropriate for a lawyer to know what his client
wants, and, by OPR\'s standard, 99% of professional lawyers could be
considered guilty of misconduct. The ethicists at OPR also claim the
Bush attorneys were wrong to stick to a legal analysis of interrogation
practices and should have also considered their moral and policy
implications. But [[the duty of the O]{.mark}ffice of [L]{.mark}egal
[C]{.mark}ounsel [is]{.mark} precisely [to offer]{.mark} [legal
advice]{.mark}, [not]{.mark} to [render]{.mark} [policy
judgments]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Interrogation policy was determined by
the **CIA and the White House**, as it should have been]{.underline}.
The last thing the country needs is for lawyers to tell the CIA how to
get actionable intelligence from enemy combatants. What\'s more, as Mr.
Mukasey\'s memo makes clear, the legal canons of Washington, D.C. and
many states expressly prohibit lawyers from offering such policy advice
to sophisticated clients such as the U.S. government. This is precisely
so lawyers don\'t muddy their legal counsel with policy bias. The rotten
quality of the OPR efforts \-- and Mr. Margolis\'s repudiation of them
\-- raises real questions about the lawyers who produced this work. H.
Marshall Jarrett, who supervised the first OPR draft, is a protege of
Mr. Holder who managed not to produce his draft report until the Bush
Administration was preparing to leave office. After Mr. Mukasey
\"memorialized\" his concerns, as his letter put it, the Jarrett draft
was leaked without the Mukasey response. Mr. Holder reassigned Mr.
Jarrett in April 2009 to lead the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys,
an arguably more powerful post. His OPR effort makes him unfit for such
a job. Mr. Holder replaced Mr. Jarrett at OPR with Mary Patrice Brown,
who tried to salvage OPR\'s original conclusions with a new but equally
deficient argument. After abandoning OPR\'s earlier specific allegations
that Messrs. Yoo and Bybee had violated D.C. Rule of Professional
Conduct 1.1 to provide competent representation and rule 2.1 to exercise
independent legal judgment, Mr. Margolis writes, Ms. Brown\'s final
report \"did not specify the rule or rules of professional conduct that
were violated.\" Instead, she added consideration of a \"best
practices\" memo and guiding principles. Mr. Margolis writes that these
documents raise several concerns, not least that \"neither of them
existed at the time Yoo and Bybee worked at OLC.\" Ms. Brown is
reportedly in line for a judicial nomination, and Republicans ought to
keep her embarrassing performance in mind when they vote on
confirmation. \-\-- Mr. Margolis deserves credit for his independent
analysis, but we also can\'t help but notice the striking change of tone
in the last few pages of his report. [Mr. Margolis\'s only duty was
determining whether the Bush attorneys had adhered to proper ethical
standards]{.underline}. **[On that question, he is unequivocal in saying
they did.]{.underline}** However, at the end of his 68-page review he
indulges in some superfluous commentary that Messrs. Yoo and Bybee
exhibited \"poor judgment\" and that some of their legal analysis was
mistaken. This is a matter of opinion \-- akin to writing an op-ed piece
\-- unrelated to the question of whether they behaved unethically, and
it is precisely the kind of judgment that Mr. Margolis says earlier in
the report that he will not render. His change of tone is notable enough
that it raises a question of whether Mr. Margolis decided to add this
concluding rhetoric as a way to propitiate Mr. Holder and to save at
least some face for the AG\'s proteges. Republicans should ask Mr.
Margolis about this if Democrats proceed with their hearings. [[The
larger story]{.mark} here [is the **vindication of**]{.mark} **Mr.
[Yoo]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and the other Bush attorneys, [who]{.mark}
[were **pilloried unfairly**]{.mark} **[over
ethics]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in what was really a **policy
dispute**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the war on terror]{.underline}.
[[Democrats wanted to appease the anti-antiterror left]{.underline},
[and they fixed on **punishing mid-level
officials**]{.underline}]{.mark} as prominent enough to get public
attention but not so prominent as to seem like a banana republic seeking
revenge against a former President or Vice President. **[[Their campaign

**Rottinghaus 17** (2017, Brandon Rottinghaus, University of Houston,
Exercising Unilateral Discretion: Presidential Justifications of
Unilateral Powers in a Shared Powers System, American Politics Research)

[[Presidents gain legal authority]{.mark} to act [from]{.mark} both [the
Constitution and]{.mark} from [statutes, making the Court]{.mark} a
[key]{.mark} element [in]{.mark} the explanation of [the use of
presidential prerogative]{.mark}]{.underline} (Whittington, 2009). This
arrangement is supported by Justice Robert Jackson's famous "practical
grouping" of presidential power in Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co. et al.
v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952). When the president acts under authority
delegated by Congress, in addition to his constitutional authority,
presidential power is at its maximum and most safe from judicial
oversight. This is confirmed by recent scholarship, which has shown that
even during wartime the Supreme Court usually casts itself as an auditor
of process, checking to see if Congress has delegated authority to the
president, rather than as an umpire of zero sum contests between
executive power and individual rights (Pildes & Issacharoff, 2004).
[Because]{.underline}, as Justice Jackson wrote in Youngstown,
"[presidential powers are not fixed but fluctuate, depending on their
disjunction or conjunction with those of Congress," [the Court
may]{.mark} intervene to [limit the exercise of unilateral power on
Congress' behalf]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This intervention is rare in
practice but this arrangement does provide for the possibility of
judicial oversight and [this **may alter the amount of discretion
employed by the president**]{.mark} **in a unilateral
order**]{.underline}. Joint, Congress--Court rejection of a president's
orders [**[would limit executive reach]{.mark}** [so presidents are
strategic in considering institutional disagreement]{.mark} when they
face a united front in the other two branches of
government]{.underline}. We presume the circumstances under which the
president will issue a unilateral order with broad or narrow discretion
are influenced by the political constraints of Congress and the Courts.
Mayer (2009) argues that "broad grants \[of authority\], ambiguity and
the potential for swift action are a compelling combination" (p. 432).
[When presidents have broad discretion, it gives the president the
authority to act when they determine such action to be
expedient]{.underline}. Presidents in general prefer to justify their
orders with broad discretion, providing them maximum flexibility and the
greatest latitude to secure their policy aims with an order. Yet, there
is a potential cost to issuing an order with broad authority, even if
properly used, in that [Congress may object to an expansive use of
authority or the courts may strike the order down on the grounds it
exceeds the executive's authority]{.underline}. [A Congress and Supreme
Court which is at ideological loggerheads with a president may object to
the president's use of an order with broad discretion because of the
policy latitude it affords a president]{.underline}. [**[A president
must weigh the possible backlash]{.underline}** [in their justification
of]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [authority]{.mark} relied upon in an
order]{.underline}. Although unilateral orders are rarely overturned,
**[[the prospect of a rebuke]{.underline}]{.mark}** [from either
Congress or the Courts]{.underline} (**[[and risking permanent inability
to act]{.mark} in the future]{.underline}**) **[[may alter a president's
behavior]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Strategic presidents will issue an
order with broad justification in political circumstances when they
think they can get away with it. What political circumstances motivate
presidents to cite broad authority? We argue the greater the distance in
ideology between the president and the median member of Congress, the
more likely the president should be to issue more orders under broad
discretion. When the president and Congress are similar in ideological
orientation, presidents are more comfortable broadening their
legislative reach through statute with a unilateral order because they
believe Congress will back them up if there are any interpretive
differences. Congress is comfortable allowing (not challenging) the
president who issues an order with broad discretion because they
generally agree ideologically and they trust the president to pursue an
agreeable policy outcome. From these findings and extending this logic,
we estimate the distance between the president and the median member of
Congress and expect that presidents are more likely to issue an order
with broad discretion when there is greater distance in ideology between
the president and the median members of each chamber (Hypothesis 1).
Using similar logic, the greater the distance in ideology between the
president and the median member of the Supreme Court, the more likely
the president is to issue more orders with broad discretion (independent
of Congress; Hypothesis 2). With broad discretion, the president is
comfortable exercising unilateral power when only one branch may push
back. The Court has also usually avoided solo, head-on confrontations
with the chief executive (Cooper, 2002). The Courts have generally been
deferential to the executive, especially on matters involving executive
prerogative, in times of crisis and when the president has taken
decisive action (Melnick, 2005). The president has flexibility to
execute the laws but this ends if he seeks to alter the "plain letter of
the law" (Rudalevige, 2014). The Court's doctrine of decision making on
cases involving executive power favors the president and, even when
challenged, presidents are more likely to reap outcomes favorable to
their use of executive power (specifically challenges to the use of
executive orders) when the majority of the justices deciding the case
are from the same political party as the president (Howell, 2003).
Ideological goals within the Court that are more proximate from the
White House's ideology (often on issues of executive power) yield a
president who should be more willing to exercise the full weight of his
discretion in unilateral orders and a court that embraces a doctrine to
allow more executive institutional control. The additive frictional
effect, however, should have the opposite outcome. [[Presidents want to
avoid joint confrontation]{.mark} with both Congress and the Courts
[given that this is a powerful recipe for halting]{.mark} executive [use
of power]{.mark}]{.underline} (either temporarily or permanently) as
discussed in the previous section. For instance, when the executive is
delegated broad discretion, it positions him to implement policy that
may deviate from legislative intent (Mayer, 2009) prompting a possible
judicial challenge (Thrower, 2016). Because the president can justify
his order using a number of statutory and nonstatutory options[,
presidents tend to choose an option that is least odious to possible
judicial oversight]{.underline} (J. D. Bailey & Rottinghaus, 2014;
Quint, 1989). Wishing to avoid an interbranch entanglement, presidents
may "seek favorable legislative terms that can insulate their decisions
from judicial review" (Whittington, 2009, p. 655). [Being generally risk
averse, in practice this implies that presidents mitigate larger claims
of discretionary action when acting unilaterally]{.underline}. As
Justice Jackson's holding implies, presidents who run afoul of Congress
(here operationalized as greater ideological distance) and who face a
court predisposed to disagree with a president (here also
operationalized as greater ideological distance), a strategic president
should adjust their citation pattern and narrow their authority as cited
in the text of the order. Therefore, when the president's ideology is
farther from both the median justice's ideology and the median member of
a Congressional chamber's ideology, he should (a) continue to use their
discretionary unilateral power but (b) mute that power so as not to
aggravate two branches of government (Hypothesis 3).5 That is, we should
continue to see presidents utilizing executive power based on statutory
authority, but that power will be justified using more narrow authority
instead of broad authority. When the president and Congress are farther
apart ideologically, but not the Court, presidents face the need for
greater interpretative room to establish an executive order and will
maximize their ability to control the outcome of that policymaking
process. [The Court may decline to intervene and/or Congress may ignore
the issue, **but [the potential of disagreement or stoppage of]{.mark} a
[policy ]{.mark}**[should be enough incentive for presidents to self
moderate]{.mark} their use of [discretion]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[The
potential of having]{.mark} two [branches]{.mark} of government jointly
[minimize a policy and set a precedent]{.mark} that may be difficult to
work around [will incentivize a strategic president to narrow]{.mark}
the scope of [their authority]{.mark}]{.underline}** under the cited
justifications in the text of the order. This allows the White House to
insulate their unilateral decision-making process for possible review
and rejection.

#### Triggers a "Congressional awakening" of snowballing constraints on executive authority

Christopher **DeMuth 16**, Distinguished Fellow-Hudson Institute, Our
Voracious Executive Branch, 2016,
<https://www.hudson.org/research/12576-our-voracious-executive-branch>

[American government has assumed a new form. [The]{.mark}]{.underline}
federal [[executive]{.underline}]{.mark} branch---the president, his
political appointees, and the hundreds of agencies that report to
them---[[has come to **exercise lawmaking powers**]{.underline}]{.mark}
that were **[[long the]{.mark} unquestioned [preserve of]{.mark}
[Congress]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For decades now, the executive has
made law through "administrative rulemaking" under loose statutory
standards such as "protect the public health." More recently, it has
moved to sheer declaration, independent of or contrary to statutory law;
[this includes]{.underline} Obama administration actions on [immigration
policy]{.underline}, [Obamacare]{.underline} implementation,
**[greenhouse gas regulation]{.underline}**, restroom rules for
transgendered persons, [and other matters]{.underline}. [The
transformation has weakened our constitutional inheritance of **checks
and balances**]{.underline}. This is more than a matter of three
branches moderating each other---they also perform distinct functions,
with separate sources of political legitimacy. Making law requires
choosing among the differing, often conflicting interests and values
abroad in society. Since the rise of republican government in the 18th
century, lawmaking has been the responsibility of legislatures whose
members represent a nation's diversity. Laws thus typically reflected
negotiation and compromise and were practical (and, yes, often muddled)
rather than ideological. Executive lawmaking also involves
compromise---the Environmental Protection Agency must navigate the
positions of Exxon Mobil and the Sierra Club---but the terrain is much
narrower and the destination more predictable. As a result, **[agencies
often enact policies a legislature would not]{.underline}**. [EPA
embarked on its greenhouse gas program in 2010 after a Democratic
Congress declined to legislate one following extended
consideration]{.underline}. President [Obama]{.underline} has [justified
this and other incursions precisely on grounds that Congress had failed
to adopt the policies he sought. The new dispensation]{.underline} also
**[alters the nature of government]{.underline}**. **[It fuses lawmaking
to the classic executive functions]{.underline}** of law enforcement and
program administration, [and to the president's **duties as head of
state and national leader**]{.underline}. The cumbersomeness of
representative lawmaking and its separation from executive and
presidential functions were important protections of limited government.
[Consolidated executive power is **efficient and
flexible**]{.underline}. It makes law on the fly and metes out selective
favors and punishments down to the level of the individual business
firm, school, and Catholic order. The affected parties respond with
increased political spending---going beyond conventional lobbying to
continuously monitoring the agencies and adapting to their latest moves;
they become agency "stakeholders." [These dynamics have expanded the
federal domain into innumerable matters]{.underline} previously decided
by state and local governments and by private citizens, institutions,
and markets. [The federal executive has become, in essence, a unitary
national government of nearly unlimited jurisdiction]{.underline}. [The
presidency has consequently become an inherently powerful
office]{.underline}. Richard Neustadt taught JFK and his successors that
they had few formal powers and had to cultivate broad public and
congressional support in order to accomplish their goals. No more. As
political scientists Kenneth S. Lowande and Sidney M. Milkis have shown,
presidents now deploy their lawmaking prerogatives for partisan
purposes---to galvanize key party constituencies, even on behalf of
broadly unpopular policies, and to spare congressional allies the
inconvenience of having to vote on those policies. The practice has
fueled the polarization of our politics, as we have seen in the agitated
reactions to President Obama's policy strokes on immigration,
transgender locker rooms, and micromanagement of college dating
behavior. It has also generated never-ending partisan campaigning to
acquire the office's immense powers, heavily financed and excitedly
reported through every daily twist and turn, which in the current round
has commandeered American politics for more than a year. Where the White
House is concerned, "the permanent campaign" is no longer a metaphor.
Executive government has many influential proponents. Traditional
progressives of the Woodrow Wilson school believe **[the complexities of
modern society demand government by expert, neutral, flexible
administrators in place of amateur, parochial, slow-moving
legislators]{.underline}**. [Modern Democratic party
progressives]{.underline} take a different tack: They [see executive
government as a potent device for mobilizing]{.underline} the [powerful
interest-groups]{.underline} (public-employee unions) and recondite
causes (intersectional feminism) that have come to dominate their party.
The proponents also include several eminent law professors and political
scientists who, whatever their progressive sympathies, believe
**[[Congress has become irredeemably
dysfunctional]{.underline}]{.mark}**---leaving us to make the most of
executive government, which is at least functional. Recent academic
books and articles valorize "the executive unbound," disparage Congress
as a "relic," and propose that the president's powers be strengthened
further by constitutional amendment or outright seizure. The opposing
camp includes skeptics of comprehensive executive power such as myself.
It finds its political voice in Tea Party advocates of the old-time
Constitution and in members of Congress opposed to the president---today
including Republican leaders Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and backbench
institutionalists Mike Lee and Ben Sasse. But history seems to be on the
side of the proponents. [The Bush administration took many extralegal
actions during and after the 2008 financial crisis]{.underline}, [such
as]{.underline} using TARP funds [to bail out automobile manufacturers,
which **set the stage for the Obama administration's
actions**]{.underline} [in more normal times]{.underline}. Both Donald
[Trump]{.underline} and Hillary Clinton have [expressed admiration
for]{.underline} President [Obama's unilateral methods and vowed to
follow his lead]{.underline}. **[But how, exactly, did we arrive at this
state of affairs?]{.underline}** The conventional explanations are
wrong: The executive state is not a realization of progressive political
theories, nor is it a partisan enterprise or a response to a polarized,
paralyzed Congress. [It is]{.underline} instead [an **organic adaptation
to**]{.underline} the **[circumstances]{.underline}** of modern
life---affluence, widespread education, elevated sensibilities, and
advanced information and communications technologies. The Big Bang of
executive government came in the early 1970s, following a
quarter-century of unprecedented economic growth and a time when
American government was still relatively nonpartisan and Congress was
fully functional. Indeed, Congress was feverishly busy---chartering a
fleet of new regulatory agencies and programs concerned with
environmental protection, product and workplace safety and health,
consumer protection, and personal finance. Soon after came an array of
energy conservation programs. The civil rights agencies, established in
the 1960s, began to expand their portfolios---policing not only racial
discrimination but also discrimination based on sex, age, and other
personal characteristics, and requiring "affirmative action" to promote
participation of these groups in the workplace, schools, and
universities. There had, of course, been many earlier regulatory
programs in the Progressive and New Deal eras. But they had been
concerned mainly with regimenting production in transportation,
communications, power, and banking, typically at the expense of
consumers. And, although they possessed wide discretion to promote "the
public interest," they exercised that discretion by adjudicating narrow
issues involving one or a few firms---such as whether to renew a radio
station's license, or to permit an airline to add a new route over the
objections of rivals. The new agencies were radically different. Instead
of cartelizing production, they promoted consumption and consumerism
and, more broadly, personal health, welfare, dignity, and lifestyle.
Rather than managing self-contained commercial disputes, the new
agencies were missionary and aspirational, pursuing open-ended
objectives of strong interest to growing numbers of citizens. And,
critically, they operated not through case-by-case adjudication but
rather "informal rulemaking." The practice had barely existed before
1970. An agency, after public notice and comment---and free of live
hearings with established standards of evidence---could issue rules
covering entire economic sectors, specifying automobile design, food
labels, manufacturing methods, employment practices, and much else,
right down to the exact placement of railings in warehouses. The rules
were typically highly detailed and prescriptive and often involved
compliance costs and social benefits of scores or hundreds of millions
of dollars. The new agencies were less like executive courts and more
like executive legislatures. The old-line New Deal and Progressive
agencies were impressed and shifted to informal rulemaking themselves.
The post-1970 agencies and their methods were more than a response to
the policy preferences of the affluent society. More fundamentally, they
were a response to the more democratic politics that affluence had
wrought. In the Progressive and New Deal eras, few people were
interested in the kinds of issues that came to the fore in the
1970s---and, even if they had been, they would have been unable to
organize and mobilize effectively on behalf of such issues. In those
days, the national political agenda was controlled by civic, business
(management and union), and party elites, who focused on their immediate
economic interests and blocked competing, disruptive
enthusiasms---especially anything involving hard-to-negotiate issues of
ideology or values. That all changed with the post-World War II growth
of incomes, education, and leisure time, dramatic improvements in
transportation and communications, and the emergence of national media.
These developments ushered in a new era of widespread political
participation and "activism" and sundered the old policy gatekeepers.
Ralph Nader showed the way with his auto safety campaign in the
mid-1960s, followed by the organizers of the first Earth Day in 1970.
The profusion of new policy causes pressing on Congress precipitated a
rank-and-file revolt, led by northern liberal Democrats with the support
of all manner of Republicans, that greatly weakened the seniority system
and the prerogatives of committee chairmen. The congressional reforms of
the early 1970s cleared the way for a more individualistic,
entrepreneurial, responsive form of legislating aligned to the political
demands of the times. But the dismantling of agenda-setting hierarchies
left Congress more unwieldy than ever and incapable of managing the
numerous causes now clamoring for members' attention. The solution was
to hand the causes over to specialized, hierarchical agencies with broad
or ambiguous rulemaking mandates that large legislative majorities could
agree upon. This was a landmark innovation in government. Business and
professional [[groups responded with a **flurry of litigation**]{.mark}
**and legislative proposals**]{.underline} [seeking to
harness]{.underline} [rulemaking with traditional legal and
constitutional restraints]{.underline}. But **[[Congress and the courts
rejected essentially all of them]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[and]{.underline} [moved in a sharply different direction. Congress
continued to delegate broad]{.underline} rulemaking
[powers]{.underline}---while enacting new requirements for agency
"sunshine" and freedom-of-information and restrictions on nonpublic
advisory meetings. [The courts fashioned new doctrines of judicial
deference]{.underline} to agency actions---while requiring, as a
condition of that deference, that agencies demonstrate responsiveness to
public comments and conscientious pursuit of their policy missions. The
measures were highly complementary. They gave the executive extensive
lawmaking discretion so long as agency procedures were transparent,
participatory, and inclusive, and agency decisions were responsive and
explained in elaborate detail. The upshot was a uniquely American fusion
of executive management and democratic form, with its own political
legitimacy and, in the decades to come, tremendous institutional
momentum. It is a regime of ad hoc, nonelectoral, managed democracy.
Democratized executive lawmaking has been growing in scope and autonomy
for more than 40 years now, mowing down a long succession of complaints
about overregulation and unelected bureaucrats and proposals for legal
and economic reform. Stupendous advances in information and
communications technologies have enabled progressively narrower
causes---on beyond clean air and safe products to animal welfare (count
me in), bank overdraft charges, low-volume showers, supply-chain
diversity, and gluten-free foods---to achieve collective self-awareness,
organize for action, and secure their own bureaus. The same technologies
have progressively increased the relative advantages of hierarchical
agencies over legislative committees in monitoring and managing
constituency groups and, more generally, in surveilling individual and
group behavior. To executive officials, making policy by Internet
postings and conference calls has come to seem natural. Congress has
increasingly become a latter-day founder of freestanding special-purpose
governments. In recent years, it has begun handing agencies not only
lawmaking power but also authority to set and collect taxes and spend
the revenues without congressional appropriations. Our executive
government is a far cry from classical progressivism. It is based not on
expertise but on specialization. Expertise is mastery of an organized,
independent body of knowledge that may contribute to solving practical
problems. Specialization, in contrast, is mastery of the practicalities
of the problems themselves. Expertise is central at a few
agencies---biological sciences at the Food and Drug Administration,
macroeconomics at the Federal Reserve---but only a few. Most agencies
are instead specialized in the politics, institutions, personalities,
and histories of a field of action. Many of those fields, such as
affirmative action and mandatory disclosure, involve nothing that could
reasonably be called expertise (the programs require employers or
producers to act in certain ways with the knowledge they have). Others,
such as pollution control and product safety, involve engineering and
other technical information, but the agencies are mainly consumers, not
suppliers, of that information. Regulated firms and other parties
provide them with, for example, technical assessments of the feasibility
of automobile fuel efficiency standards or statistical regressions of
chemical exposure and health effects. Often the information is
conflicting or ambiguous. The agencies use it selectively, in
conjunction with value judgments and political calculations. Outside the
FDA and the Fed and a few other agencies, the actual decision-makers are
generalists---political appointees who could as well be members of
Congress, and civil servants who could as well be congressional
staffers. Legislators and judges understand all of this, so when they
speak of agency expertise they are usually rationalizing decisions made
on other grounds. In last year's decision in King v. Burwell, the
Supreme Court held that Obamacare tax subsidies could be offered on
federal as well as state health insurance exchanges. Its opinion
emphasized that the administration's decision to this effect had been
made by the Internal Revenue Service---which "has no expertise in
crafting health insurance policy" (unlike, presumably, the Department of
Health and Human Services). That helped get the Court where it wanted to
go---to deciding the question itself rather than deferring to the
administration's decision---but it was pure fiction. Whether to extend
subsidies to federal exchanges involved no expertise whatever. It was
entirely a political question (with only one possible answer for the
Obama administration), and the IRS and HHS were on the same political
team. The distinction between expertise and specialization is crucial
for two reasons. First, expertise is supposed to be neutral and
professional. It is envisioned as a superior substitute for the messy
clash of private interests in guiding public policy. But American
regulatory agencies, as we have noted, are obliged to be messy---porous
to outside influence, participatory, democratic. That guarantees they
cannot be aloof and detached in the manner (so it is said) of French and
German administrators. Second, specialization is the opposite of
detachment. It is a mechanism of engagement, efficiency, and growth.
Adam Smith emphasized the central role of the division of labor in
promoting economic growth on the first page of The Wealth of Nations;
the subsequent centuries of unprecedented growth are a history of
ever-increasing specialization in knowledge and practice. The more
recent growth of executive government is a testament to the power of
specialization in political practice. [The executive has eclipsed
Congress **precisely because of** its]{.underline} superior capacity for
growth. Specialized agencies can be multiplied essentially without
limit, and each one is an efficient lawmaker because of its **[freedom
from the legislature]{.underline}**'s need to achieve representative
consensus. Finally, the specialization of executive government is in
political organization, and this is often at odds with the
specialization that propels social prosperity. A common complaint about
"one size fits all" regulation---uniform standards for almost anything
that comes to the regulator's attention---is that it suppresses variety
and innovation in production and ignores differences in personal
preferences and local circumstances. These are the "complexities" of the
modern economy that expertise is supposed to accommodate! But for the
politically specialized agency, suppressing diversity is frequently the
whole point---to accommodate the ideological positions, membership
needs, or corporate interests of members of their "stakeholder
communities." The evolutionary, adaptive nature of executive government
may suggest that the prospects are dim for controlling its future
course. Yet in private life, affluence and technology---in the form of
the automobile, television, birth-control pill, Internet, and mobile
smartphone---have brought many serious problems along with their
cornucopian benefits. Over time, we have learned to control the
problems. True progressivism consists of realizing the benefits while
limiting the harms of the growing powers that wealth and technology
place in our hands. That should be our goal in the public sphere as
well. [A possible **opening**]{.underline} [lies in the excesses of
the]{.underline} Obama [administration, which have broken the
mold]{.underline} of post-1970 regulation. Making national policy by
decree violates the requirements of public notice, participation, and
responsiveness that have legitimized executive lawmaking. The Obamacare
and Dodd-Frank programs are making mock of their consumerist
pretensions. Billed as providing "Affordable Care and Patient
Protection" and "Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection," in
practice both programs consist of active collaboration with large
producers. They are throwbacks to New Deal industrial regimes and are
degrading health insurance and banking services in ways that are
increasingly conspicuous. [The president's imposition]{.underline} of
New Deal utility controls on the Internet [is]{.underline} even more
[jarringly anachronistic]{.underline} [and]{.underline} is alienating
sophisticated technologists. The administration [may be taking America
to a further]{.underline}, darker [stage of executive
lawmaking]{.underline}---more authoritarian and syndicalist. But [it
may]{.underline} instead be **[provok]{.underline}**ing
[[**reactions**]{.mark} that, **[once underway]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[could go **beyond correcting individual abuses**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The courts---and not only conservative judges and justices---are clearly
rethinking many of their doctrines of deference to executive discretion,
and their [[decisions could **rouse Congress to broader
responses**]{.underline}]{.mark}: The administration's practice of
skirting notice-and-comment rulemaking, in its actions on immigration,
transgender restrooms, and other matters, is being vigorously litigated.
The cases are [[prompting Congress to consider]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[banning now-common]{.underline}]{.mark}** agency
**[[lawmaking]{.underline}]{.mark}** by such devices as "guidance
documents" and the notorious "Dear Colleague" letters from the Education
Department's Office for Civil Rights. The Supreme Court recently issued
its second unanimous decision in recent years rejecting the
administration's denial of hearings to citizens caught in its impossibly
expansive definition of "waters of the United States."
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} [[could **embolden
Congress**]{.underline}]{.mark} to revisit the Clean Water Act
[and]{.underline}, even better, to guarantee citizens hearings before
tribunals that are independent of prosecuting agencies. Another recent
Supreme Court decision held that the EPA must take account of the costs
as well as benefits of its pollution controls under a general
"appropriate and necessary" statutory standard, and recent Court of
Appeals decisions have applied similar reasoning to certain SEC rules.
The decisions [point the way to a **general** statutory
requirement]{.underline} that agency benefit-cost assessments be subject
to judicial review. Strong legal and constitutional challenges are
underway to key features of Obamacare, Dodd-Frank, and the EPA's Clean
Power Plan and have produced some promising preliminary decisions.
**[Further [successes]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[would strengthen
Congress's hand]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}**
these **[momentous instances of [executive
unilateralism]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [**[and]{.mark}**]{.underline}
might **[even [prompt a movement away from congressional
over-delegation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Measures such as these would be
in the time-honored political tradition, going back to the Declaration
of Independence and Magna Carta, of taking concrete abuses as the
occasion for [[instigating]{.mark} **[broader
reform]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In seizing the opportunities as they
arise, we should keep in mind that the ultimate goal is [[to
**correct**]{.underline}]{.mark} the pathologies of **[[concentrated
executive power]{.underline}]{.mark}** and to make our system of
specialized, pertinacious lawmaking more representative, moderate, and
respectful of the problem-solving strengths of private society. And that
will take something more: [[a **great reawakening in
Congress**]{.underline}]{.mark} itself that [[leads to **more vigorous
legislating and a more auspicious balance** of]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
[powers]{.mark} of making and administering our laws.]{.underline}

#### Actions modifying presidential power set a [precedent]{.underline}. The [War Powers Resolution]{.underline} and other [historical examples]{.underline} prove

Christopher **Paul 8,** Senior Social Scientist at RAND, "US
Presidential War Powers: Legacy Chains in Military Intervention
Decisionmaking," Journal of Peace Research (Vol. 45, No. 5), JSTOR

There\'s an obvious kernel of truth to the old saying, \'Generals always
fight the last war\'. [This article explores]{.underline} one of the
sources of this kind of policy inertia, [\'legacy chains]{.underline}\',
by examining the sequence of disputes over military deployments that led
up to the United States War Powers Resolution of 1973 and its impact on
the US military interventions that have followed. [The War Powers
Resolution was passed by a Congress attempting to re store balance to
war-making powers]{.underline} constitutionally divided between the
Congress (as the only body legally allowed to make a \'declaration of
war\') and the president (the commander in chief). [This article traces
the war powers legacy chain through the US military operations in Korea,
Vietnam, the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Panama, Iraq, Haiti, and Iraq
again. The exercise of war powers]{.underline} (and the disputes
associated with them) [for these military operations show how [legacies
are formed and **institutionalized**]{.mark} **within a policy sphere**;
how institutionalized legacies affect subsequent policy]{.underline} (in
sometimes unintended ways); [and how subsequent [policies **modify,
transform, or reinforce**]{.mark} these [legacies]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[Based on]{.mark} the War Powers example and other [**historical
data**,]{.mark}]{.underline} this article argues that [[past
policy]{.mark} affects subsequent policy by creating institutional
legacies that **[shape the decision space]{.mark}** [in which]{.mark}
subsequent [policy is made]{.mark}. These institutional legacies can be
modified, transformed, and/or reinforced by subsequent policymaking and
then constitute \'legacy chains\'.]{.underline} Legacy Chains Finegold &
Skocpol (1995: 222) describe policy legacies: [Past and present policies
are connected in at least three different ways. First, [past policies
give rise to **analogies**]{.mark} [that affect]{.mark} [how]{.mark}
public [officials **think about contemporary policy
issues**]{.mark}**.** Second, [past policies **suggest lessons**]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} [help]{.mark} [us]{.mark} to [understand]{.mark} the
[processes by which **contemporary policies are
formulated**]{.mark}]{.underline} and implemented [and by which the
**consequences of contemporary policies** will be
determined.]{.underline} [Third, [past policies impose
**limitations**]{.mark} [that **reduce the range of policy
choices**]{.mark} available as responses to contemporary
problems.]{.underline} All three of the ways in which they connect past
policy to present policy can be viewed as changes in the institutional
context in which policy is made. [These legacies are institutionalized
in two different ways: first, through changes in formal rules or
procedures, and second, in the **\'taken for granteds\'**,
**\'schemas\'**, and accepted wisdom of policy makers and ordinary
citizens alike]{.underline} (Sewell, 1992: 1-29). While [a
policy]{.underline} or event can leave multiple legacies, it [often
leaves a single major legacy.]{.underline} For example, [the War Powers
Resolution formally changed the relationship between the president and
the congress with regard to **war-making** and the deployment of troops.
Subsequent military interventions were influenced by this change and
have, in turn, left their own]{.underline} legacy (legal scholars might
call it **[precedent]{.underline}**) as a link in that chain. Legacy
chains can be modified, transformed, or reinforced as they step through
each \'link\' in the chain. As another example, US involvement in
Vietnam left a legacy in the sphere of press/military relations which
affected the intervention in Grenada in 1983 (the press was completely
excluded for the first 48 hours of the operation). The press legacy
chain begun in Vietnam also affected the Panama invasion of 1989 (a
press pool was activated, in country, but excluded from the action), but
the legacy had been transformed slightly by the Grenada invasion (the
press pool system itself grew out of complaint regarding press exclusion
in Grenada) (Paul & Kim, 2004). Because of the different ways in which
policy legacies are institutionalized, [some [legacies have]{.mark}
**[unintended institutional consequences.]{.mark}** The [War Powers
Resolution]{.mark}]{.underline} was intended to curtail presidential
war-making powers and return some authority to the congress. In
practice, the joint resolution [failed to force presidents to include
congressional participation]{.underline} in their intervention decision
making, [but it [had the unintended consequence of]{.mark} [forcing them
to change the way they planned interventions]{.mark} **to comply with
the letter of the law**]{.underline} (see the extended ex ample
presented later in the article).1

#### Checks now [spill over]{.underline} and [irreparably hamstring]{.underline} broad presidential powers

Eric **Posner and** Emily **Bazelon 17**, he's a professor at U Chicago
Law School, \"Will the Presidency Survive This President?\", New York
Times,
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/20/sunday-review/donald-trump-will-presidency-survive.html

With the courts and the intelligence community increasingly arrayed
against him, and Congress now investigating his campaign and actions in
office, Mr. Trump finds himself in a much diminished presidency. If he
remains in office for an extended period in this weakened state, [[it's
possible]{.mark} that [Congress]{.mark} and the courts [will]{.mark}
essentially **[put the presidency into]{.mark} a kind of [constitutional
receivership]{.mark}** until his term ends]{.underline}. What would
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} look like? It's hard to know, but it [[would
be a **striking setback to presidential
power**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} After Watergate brought the presidency
low, subsequent presidents took back power, largely with the
acquiescence of Congress and the courts. Both George W. Bush and Barack
Obama flexed their executive muscles. Mr. Bush enhanced the president's
control over national security after the Sept. 11 attacks by opening
Guantánamo, trying terrorism suspects before military tribunals, and
authorizing warrantless wiretapping. Mr. Obama took unilateral
aggressive actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reform
immigration. They left the office stronger than when they arrived.
Although their policies were controversial, both presidents were given
deference because they made their judgments conscientiously and led the
government professionally. But Mr. [Trump has created an entirely new
problem for Congress, the courts and agencies: What do they do when the
president himself is the pressing danger?]{.underline} Unlike other
presidents, Mr. Trump has lacked the basic competence to manage the
government. [[If Congress]{.mark} and the courts [diminish the power of
the office]{.mark} to constrain him, [could they **leave the office too
weak for future presidents to be able to govern
effectively**]{.mark}]{.underline}?

#### The aff's [reactionary response]{.underline} to Trump crushes [overall executive power]{.underline}

Jack **Goldsmith 17**, Law Professor @ Harvard, conversation with Bill
Kristol, 12/30, "American Institutions and the Trump Presidency,"
http://jackgoldsmith.org/american-institutions-trump-presidency/

GOLDSMITH: But there hasn't been that kind of principled reflection, in
my view, at all. And I will say, [Trump has had a good impact across the
country]{.underline}. I'll give you a better example than my colleagues
at Harvard Law: [There's much more widespread respect for the
intelligence community now.]{.underline} There's so many people left of
center in the Democratic Party who are standing up for the integrity of
the intelligence community. That is a major accomplishment of Donald
Trump. And that would not have happened -- only he could do that.

[It's happened]{.underline} a little bit [with the rule of
law]{.underline}, I think, and I actually do believe, and agree with
you, that, maybe not my colleagues at Harvard, but more generally in the
populous, I think [there is an appreciation for checks and balances,
their importance, how they operate]{.underline}. I think there is, in my
view, a very healthy --

This is how it's changed. So my colleagues -- we all go back and forth
to some degree on this, but the bulk of my colleagues really were quite
onboard for executive power under President Obama, and they weren't so
much onboard under George W. Bush, and they're definitely not onboard
for it now. And I do think, especially to the extent that Trump is using
some of Obama's playbook, especially in foreign affairs but also in
domestic affairs, that maybe some of the views during the Obama
administration have tempered a bit.

But, more generally, I think that it's not all a bad story. Trump has
taught the country some basic civics lessons that I think are very
useful. And, hopefully, as a country we'll remember -- I'm not
optimistic -- but hopefully will outlast his presidency.

[[What's likely to happen is]{.underline}]{.mark} -- this is what
happened -- is that we're going to have [[an **overreaction to**]{.mark}
**the [Trump]{.mark} presidency**, [that]{.mark} [we'll put **huge
constraints on the president**]{.mark}]{.underline} that will -- **[[we
need a powerful Presidency]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Arthur Schlesinger,
Jr. who wrote The Imperial Presidency, and who was very critical of the
imperial presidency, he always emphasized -- because, of course, he
loved the presidency with the right kind of president -- he always
emphasized, correctly in my view, that [[the **great**]{.mark}
[**presidents** are **powerful**]{.mark} **presidents**. [Our system
**works best**]{.mark}, the constitutional system works best [when we
have **powerful presidential leadership that's
principled**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

And so [[one danger]{.mark} of Trump [is that we'll
**overreact**]{.mark} **to this president [and shackle the presidency
for a while.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### The plan creates a cycle of always looking and expecting statutory clarification that limits presidential power because Congress is slow and uniformed.

Legislate United States Foreign Policy Toward Nicaragua \-- The Boland
Amendments", 54 Brooklyn L. Rev. 131, lexis)

Traditionally, [the president has exercised greater control over foreign
policy-making than has Congress.]{.underline} n28 Since the earliest
days of the Republic, [that office has been responsible for
communicating with other governments on behalf of the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. n29 Continuous contacts with
other nations generated innumerable issues for resolution. n30 As a
result of the President\'s continuous participation in the daily matters
affecting foreign affairs, his position as chief spokesperson was
established. [The role did not emerge from any constitutionally inherent
superiority]{.underline} he possessed, **[but rather from the practical
necessity of having to make decisions.]{.underline}** **[[Decisions on
day-to-day matters were often made]{.mark} [\"on the spot\" by the
executive]{.mark} branch [personnel]{.mark}.]{.underline}** n31 [When
larger issues were involved, the president articulated the United States
position]{.underline}, again, [for practical reasons]{.underline}. He
was always in session and Congress was not. [Congress could only be
specially convened with difficulty]{.underline}. n32 [Moreover, [the
**president\'s access to the facts**]{.mark}, and the advice of
subordinates, **[permitted quick action]{.mark}** if required by the
circumstances]{.underline}. n33 In addition, Congress may be said to
have permitted the expansion of executive authority without challenge.
\"\[Congress\] did not equip itself with expertise, so as to acquire a
dominant authority in foreign relations, or even a continuous, informed
participation.\" n34 It might even be said that Congress facilitated
\[\*140\] the expansion of presidential power over foreign affairs by
providing him large \"grants of power with only general lines of
guidance.\" n35 In effect, the executive branch obtained a large degree
of discretion to formulate and implement policy. n36 [The expansion of
presidential authority over foreign policy-making continued well into
the twentieth century]{.underline}, with the period between 1940 and
1970, principally because of the Second World War and its aftermath,
seeing the greatest rise in the president\'s authority over foreign
affairs. n37 [The exigencies of]{.underline} participating in that [War,
and the United States\' position immediately following it, permitted
this expansion.]{.underline} n38 Later, however, this country\'s growing
dissatisfaction with its involvement in Vietnam, and a president
weakened by the Watergate affair, set the stage for a dramatic
confrontation between Congress and the executive over which branch would
control the direction of foreign policy-making. n39 Some have termed
this confrontation over the means necessary to achieve a policy goal a
revolution \-- with Congress entitled to claim victory. n40 Congress
denied the president statutory authorization and the necessary funding
to maintain United States support for the South Vietnamese. n41
Unfortunately, the legislation hastened the \[\*141\] overthrow of the
South Vietnamese government \"\[b\]y using the public legislative
process to prohibit the president from using force, the legislators
signaled Hanoi that the South could now be plucked with impunity.\" n42
These prohibitions on the use of force also confronted President Ford
during the 1975 fall of Saigon. n43 As North Vietnamese troops overran
Saigon, President Ford faced the choice of either \"breaking the law\"
by airlifting the United States soldiers and pro-American Vietnamese out
of Vietnam, or following the law thereby permitting them to be captured
or killed. n44 President Ford did authorize the airlift. n45 Yet even as
the airlift proceeded, Congress debated for two weeks the passage of a
resolution that would have authorized this action. n46 This legislation
was originally proposed to prevent President Nixon from continuing the
war, however, as enacted it also applied to President Ford and the
airlift, a situation Congress did not, and could not have \[\*142\]
foreseen. n47 [[Congressional efforts to **limit the scope** of
executive foreign policy-making]{.mark} via legislation]{.underline}
have carried over into the 1980\'s. Along with it, the tension between
the executive and legislative branches has been exacerbated. While the
executive seeks broader discretion, the legislature [[seeks to foreclose
discretion]{.mark} by statutory command. This conflict can degenerate
into a foreign policy driven by questions of statutory
interpretation.]{.underline} n48 **[[The need for flexibility and
discretion is axiomatic]{.mark} in foreign policy-making.]{.underline}**

long as **[[the circle continues to generate more legislation and narrow
constructions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, executive/legislative tensions
will exist and continue to thwart a meaningful cooperation between the
branches. Unfortunately, this is precisely what resulted from the
numerous enactments **[[seeking to micromanage the president\'s

#### The plan emboldens Congress \-\-- spills over to destroy the presidency

**Rostow, Yale senior research scholar, 1989**

(Eugene, "The United States Constitution In Its Third Century: Foreign
Affairs: Distribution Of Constitutional Authority: President, Prime
Minister Or Constitutional Monarch?", October, A.J.I.L. 740, lexis)

I should summarize my answer to the question in these terms: Until the
mid-1970s, our strenuously balanced Constitution was not only adequate,
but altogether satisfactory. Since that time, however, an unusually
vigorous and sustained congressional bid for supremacy over the
Executive, stimulated by the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal, has
threatened to convert the American President into a prime minister or
even a benign constitutional monarch. This possibility will not
materialize over the long run, because what Madison called \"the impulse
of self-preservation\" will prevail: the security of the United States
requires a strong President working in harness with a strong Congress.
The long run, however, may be too long for comfort. In the modern world,
**[the nation\'s [safety is at risk so long as the foreign policy
process is dominated by]{.mark} a [Congress aspiring to take over the
executive power]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} During his presidential
campaign in 1988, Vice President [Bush]{.underline} said that he
[regarded the constitutional defense of the Presidency as one of the
President\'s major responsibilities.]{.underline} The Reagan
administration, like the Ford and Carter administrations before it, was
not notably active on this front, and [it is to be hoped
that]{.underline} President [Bush will succeed]{.underline} quickly [in
restoring the constitutional balance between the Presidency and
Congress]{.underline}. Much turns on the outcome of his effort. The
remedies President Bush must seek are not structural, but substantive.
Preaching or even practicing consultation and cooperation, desirable as
they are if not indulged to excess, is no panacea. **[[The]{.mark}
[conflict is about power]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and it cannot be solved
by tinkering with tables of organization and flow charts,
**[[passing]{.underline}]{.mark}** more
**[[statutes]{.underline}]{.mark}** that purport **[[to regulate the
President\'s]{.underline}]{.mark}** work
**[[habits]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or even amending the Constitution. If
the extraordinary gains in power Congress has achieved during this
period are to be undone, the change will have to be achieved by the
President and the federal courts acting together. Congress cannot be
expected to give up its hard-won modern privileges voluntarily.
Therefore, the judiciary should act. The courts have often been called
the balance wheel of the Constitution. In this instance, the rhetorical
cliche is apt. The courts are the only institution of government
directly charged with the task of enforcing the constitutional limits of
power. The judiciary cannot act, however, without test cases, and the
President has always been an important initiator of test cases. In the
field of international relations, the Government of the United States
has all the rights, powers, privileges, immunities and duties of
nationhood or \"sovereignty\" recognized in international law. The
international powers of the nation are not to be deduced from the few
spare words \[\*742\] of the constitutional text, but from their matrix
in international law. Those powers are divided by the Constitution
between Congress and the President. In this as in other areas of
governmental responsibility, Congress is entrusted with specified
legislative powers and the President with \"the\" executive power of the
United States, save for a number of exceptions noted in the document
itself, i.e., the Senate\'s voice in the making of appointments and the
ratification of treaties, and Congress\'s power to declare war. No one
has ever improved on Hamilton\'s definition of executive power. All
governmental power that is neither legislative nor judicial, he said, is
executive. n2 For nearly 200 years, that simple division of authority,
interpreted in the light of experience, permitted effective policymaking
through the only constitutional pattern for conducting foreign relations
compatible with the nature of world politics, on the one hand, and with
the American political culture, on the other. The President is not
elected by Congress. He is not a creature of Congress. And he is not
required to report to Congress, except for his annual State of the Union
message. The historical experience of the United States confirms the
wisdom of Marshall\'s comment in Marbury v. Madison that \"the secrets
of the cabinet\" are beyond outside scrutiny, n3 and that \"the
President is invested with certain important political powers, in the
exercise of which he is to use his own discretion, and is accountable
only to his country in his political character, and to his own
conscience.\" n4 In these areas, Congress can request information of the
President; it can never command it. This is not to say that the
President is above the law. Marbury v. Madison demonstrates the
contrary. But the law is vindicated by many procedures without
subordinating the President to Congress or the courts in all cases. The
constitutional process does not always produce wise results. That is
another matter. But until recently, it worked as a political procedure.
The mistakes the nation made were not the consequence of inadequate
deliberation, but of inadequate thought. It was also a strenuous
procedure, in which the rivalry between Congress and the President fully
met the standard of Justice Brandeis\'s celebrated maxim. Justice
Brandeis wrote: The doctrine of the separation of powers was adopted by
the Convention of 1787, not to promote efficiency but to preclude the
exercise of arbitrary power. The purpose was, not to avoid friction,
but, by means of the inevitable friction incident to the distribution of
the governmental powers among three departments, to save the people from
autocracy. n5 In recent years, however, the pattern has changed, on the
surface at least. The tension between Congress and the President is no
longer the push and pull of a natural tug of war between the Legislative
and the Executive, \[\*743\] operating as partners within the framework
of well-understood rules and habits. **[[The balance]{.mark} between
Congress and the Presidency [has shifted]{.mark}]{.underline}** so much
and so radically that \"the inevitable friction\" Justice Brandeis
welcomed has become something quite new \-- a real war, marked by a slow
presidential retreat [**that is [transforming the President into a
ceremonial figurehead]{.mark} graciously [presiding over]{.mark} the
activities of [an omnipotent Congress]{.mark}.** The]{.underline}
historic constitutional [powers of the Presidency]{.underline} have not
been formally annulled. They are still latent in the bloodstream of the
Government. But they [encounter more and more resistance each time a
President tries to use them**. As a result, [the President
is]{.mark}**]{.underline} being **[[gradually stripped
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** some of **[[his most important
powers]{.mark}.]{.underline}** If present trends are not reversed,
**[[he will soon be wrapped like Gulliver in a web of regulatory
statutes and hopelessly weakened.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Congress has
not given up trying to nullify the President\'s veto power, despite the
decision of the Supreme Court in the Chadha case; n6 Congress has taken
almost no steps to comply with that decision by repealing all the
statutes within its orbit. Congressional leaders sometimes conduct
diplomatic relations with foreign governments, as they have done
recently with Nicaragua, for example, and with other governments as
well. Substantive riders on appropriations bills and other devices to
evade the President\'s veto power are more popular than ever. [Congress
is]{.underline} now even [proposing to put the President under the
control of a congressional cabinet in the exercise of his]{.underline}
responsibilities for intelligence and the [use of force, and foreign
policy in general]{.underline}. And it is more and more common for
statutes to prescribe what have always been considered matters of
executive discretion, e.g., how and where to conduct military
operations. Why should one characterize the development of the
relationship between Congress and the President in recent years as a
crisis rather than a stage in the healthy and normal evolution of
constitutional law? The justification for that opinion, I submit, is
neither a pious antiquarian interest in preserving the original
Constitution, nor even a concern for effective government, important as
it is, but a policy of vigilance against the risk of tyranny. What is at
stake in this experience was powerfully analyzed by Madison in Nos. 47
and 48 of the Federalist Papers. [Madison warned that the **greatest
danger to the constitutional order**]{.underline} and to the liberty of
the citizen [was not the possibility of a tyrant President]{.underline},
which he regarded as slight, [but the risk that Congress would take over
the powers of the other two branches of government]{.underline}. \"The
accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in
the same hands,\" Madison wrote, \"may justly be pronounced the very
definition of tyranny.\" n7 Power \"is of an encroaching nature,\" n8
Madison remarked, and something more than \"parchment barriers\" is
required to restrict it \"from passing the limit \[\*744\] assigned to
it.\" n9 The risk of congressional abuse of power is great, far greater
than the risk from the President or the courts. Congress \"alone has
access to the pockets of the people.\" n10 Its supposed influence over
the people is an inducement to act, and it can expand its power in many
ways, masking its encroachments \"under complicated and indirect
measures.\" n11 Madison concluded that \"it is against the enterprising
ambition of this department that the people ought to indulge all their
jealousy and exhaust all their precautions.\" n12 \"The legislative
department is everywhere extending its sphere of activity, and drawing
all power into its impetuous vortex.\" n13 Confronting the growth of
congressional power, many scholars accept the thesis of congressional
supremacy in the plausible name of \"democracy.\" [[The choice of
congressional supremacy]{.mark} as the major premise for their analysis
[is most often made]{.mark}]{.underline} casually, almost instinctively,
and almost always [[without extended consideration]{.mark} of what is
involved.]{.underline} These writers normally preface their treatment of
the issue with the familiar, but erroneous, comment to the effect that
Congress is simply trying \"to recapture legislative power\" that had
drifted to the President since Lincoln, McKinley or Franklin D.
Roosevelt took office. It is amply clear, as two recent full dress
reviews of the problem demonstrate, n14 that since the time of George
Washington, Presidents and Congress have conducted America\'s foreign
policy in roughly the same pattern of constitutional usage. Some
proponents of congressional supremacy dismiss this evidence of
constitutional practice on a most astonishing ground. Arthur M.
Schlesinger, Jr., for example, writes that the early Presidents
\"usurped power and thereby created no constitutional precedent \-- an
action to be distinguished from the claims of legal sanctions for
extreme acts characteristic of presidents of the last generation, claims
that would set dangerous precedents for the future.\" n15 Schlesinger
believes the exclusive power to declare war conferred on Congress in
Article I, section 8 gives Congress the sole authority to use or
threaten to use the national force, save perhaps in the case of sudden
attacks. n16 This common view rests on two simple errors. Under
international law, to which the relevant paragraphs of Article I refer,
declarations of war are required only for the rare occasions when states
engage in unlimited general war. As the Founding Fathers knew from
intimate experience, such declarations are not required when states feel
compelled to use limited force in defending themselves not only against
\"sudden attacks\" but against many \[\*745\] other breaches of
international law of a forceful character. n17 During the last 200
years, the United States has declared war only five times, but
Presidents have used the armed forces abroad at least 200 times, usually
on their own authority, sometimes with the support of joint resolutions
before or after the event. What President Kennedy did during the Cuban
missile crisis of 1962, as Professor Schlesinger will recall, was a
presidential action of this kind. And Hamilton argued that Congress\'s
power to declare war, being an exception to the general powers of the
Executive according to the model the Founding Fathers knew best, that of
the British Crown, should be confined to the terms of the text. The
second error in Schlesinger\'s article is equally conclusive.
Presidential uses of force in dealing with the threat of force or the
use of force against the nation were never presented by Presidents as
unconstitutional and treated with guilty attempts at concealment. They
began during President Washington\'s first term. Congress acknowledged
such actions as obviously proper, then and later. I should contend that
most of Lincoln\'s actions before and during the Civil War and Franklin
D. Roosevelt\'s actions before Pearl Harbor were valid exercises of the
President\'s emergency prerogative powers, not unconstitutional
violations of law at all. The United States has all the powers of
statehood recognized in international law and therefore has emergency
powers like those of other nations. If Congress has not exercised these
emergency powers, or cannot exercise them, the President has
constitutional authority to do so. And circumstances may create
situations, as Locke recognized, where it would be constitutionally
proper for the executive to act even in contravention of the written
laws. n18 To my mind, it seems contrary to the most elementary notions
of legal theory to claim that Lincoln\'s conduct of the Civil War, the
most important single use of presidential power in American history, was
unconstitutional. From that judgment, I should except his suspension of
martial law where the civil courts were open, but little beyond it.
Nonetheless, the principle of congressional supremacy continues to be
asserted. Thus, Frederick M. Kaiser finds that while the Constitution
seems to establish a system of checks and balances among seemingly
separate branches of the Government, in fact it provides for legislative
supremacy. The rationale behind this conclusion, Kaiser writes, \"is
that a representative assembly is less of a threat to the rights of
citizens and to the other branches than is the unitary office of
President, where constitutional authority is centralized in one
individual.\" n19 The status of Congress as \"the first branch of
government\" is further confirmed, he contends, by the fact that it is
created by the first article of the Constitution, by its power to
override a \[\*746\] presidential veto and by its impeachment power. n20
And Professor Henkin, dismissing Hamilton, supports Hamilton\'s critics
who insist that the President has only the few powers expressly granted
him; that those powers are subtracted from the plenary powers of
Congress, and are therefore to be narrowly construed; and that in
foreign as in domestic affairs Congress is primary and supreme. n21 In
the end, however, Henkin\'s conclusions derive from a quite different
and consciously extraconstitutional standard of judgment. The question
for us to face, Henkin says, is not what our constitutional history
requires or permits, but \"what kind of country we are and wish to be. I
am disposed to state the question as: How should foreign affairs be run
in a republic that has become a democracy?\" n22 This is unilateral
lawmaking with a vengeance, going far beyond the interstitial. Henkin
boldly admits what is implicit in the writings of Reveley, Lofgren,
Kaiser, Fisher and other advocates of congressional supremacy. They
claim their views are compatible with the constitutional experience of
the United States. Henkin asks for a new Constitution, based on the
mystical proposition that the American \"republic has become a
democracy.\" From this vantage point, he has no difficulty in concluding
that Congress can if it wishes regulate the President fully, save in the
few areas where the President\'s claim to independent power is
historically too well established to be challenged. Given his major
premise, it is surprising that Henkin concedes so much to orthodoxy.
Such opinions take too simple a view. The constitutional arrangements
required to safeguard democratic government in a large country are more
complex than those of a Vermont town meeting. And even a Vermont town
meeting is not government by universal voice vote on every issue. The
members of Congress are indeed elected by state-wide and district-wide
constituencies. But the President is elected too. And judges and many
other officials have unimpeachable democratic legitimacy even though
their authority is derived from appointment rather than from election.
n23 The defenders of congressional supremacy make much of the fact that
Congress necessarily has the last word. But Congress does not have the
last word on all subjects. Even in exercising its power over
appropriations, it faces the constraining doctrine of \"unconstitutional
conditions.\" It cannot, for example, recognize foreign governments,
retain or dismiss federal officials, n24 impose legislative punishments
n25 or decide on the strategy and tactics of wars. n26 Congress has the
last word only in the superficial sense that it \[\*747\] could if it
wished refuse to appropriate money for the President and the courts. To
make that possibility the central issue in the constitutional debate
begs the question. Congress would refuse such funds only under
conditions of revolution, after the constitutional order had in fact
collapsed or been destroyed. Short of revolution, the claims of
congressional \"supremacy\" in this sense repudiate both the origins and
the subsequent history of the Constitution. The Founding Fathers came
together first in Annapolis and then in Philadelphia because the nation
was floundering under a government that was entirely congressional. The
purpose and effect of the Constitution was to replace congressional
government by a more complex system consisting of three autonomous,
overlapping and interdependent branches, each of which, however, is
entirely independent in some of its functions. It is impossible to
exaggerate the practical effects of the new doctrine that the three
branches of the American Government are not equal, but that Congress is
primus inter pares. It would stand on its head one of the most important
principles of policy that have hitherto governed the construction of the
Constitution by the Supreme Court, by Presidents and by Congress. That
principle is sometimes compressed into a legal formula, first stated by
Hamilton, and supported thereafter by Jefferson, Marshall and many
others, as well as by the pattern of usage. If a power is executive in
nature, Hamilton said \-- that is, if it is neither legislative nor
judicial \-- whether it happens to be mentioned in the text of the
Constitution or not, it is presidential in character, unless it is
excluded by the constitutional text. If a power is executive in this
sense, presidential supremacy is the rule and congressional authority
the exception, and exceptions are to be narrowly construed. n27
Hamilton\'s formula applied to the President the principle expounded
later in relation to Congress by Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland. n28
The several powers of the national Government, Marshall wrote, were
conferred by the people in a brief, general constitution designed to be
read and understood by the citizens at large. That document did not
attempt to define the Government\'s powers in detail or to foresee every
situation in which they would be applied in the future. The Constitution
is not \"a prolix code,\" but a legal instrument intended to be
interpreted by \"general reasoning.\" When construing the powers of the
national institutions, the rule of construction should not be narrow or
niggardly, but one dominated by the great purposes of the Constitution
itself. \"Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the
constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly
adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the
letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.\" n29 The
modern idea of congressional supremacy would repudiate and reverse
Marshall\'s rule of construction. Congressional supremacy is taken to be
the rule for all questions, not only for those which are legislative in
\[\*748\] character. The President would be confined to those powers
mentioned in the Constitution as presidential, and even those powers
would be narrowly construed as exceptions to a general rule of
congressional supremacy. **[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}** normal
**[congressional [impulse to nibble at the President\'s
authority]{.mark}]{.underline}** has **[[gained]{.mark}
[momentum]{.mark}]{.underline}** in recent years from four major
sources. The first and perhaps the most important has been the nearly
incredible growth in congressional staff, which goes back to the
Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946. n30 Before that fateful reform
was adopted, Congress and its committees relied largely on the
administration of the day for assistance in research and drafting.
Indeed, in those far-off times, members of Congress often did their own
research and drafting. The Congressional Research Service of the Library
of Congress provided some supplemental help, but until the recent past
that service was extremely small. Today, congressional staffs include
some 35,000 people, and the Congressional Research Service another
5,000. It is hardly remarkable that Capitol Hill has been sprouting
splendid marble palaces to house the new bureaucracy. Like many other
reasonable reforms, the growth of congressional staff has had unforeseen
consequences. Members of Congress and their proliferating committees and
subcommittees have discovered that able and independent staffs are a
decided asset for electoral as well as legislative purposes.
Furthermore, appointing members of these staffs is a fruitful form of
political patronage. And the staffs themselves have transformed the
contest between the President and Congress. The young men and women who
serve Congress are intelligent, hard working and ambitious. They achieve
satisfaction and reputation not by rubber-stamping the plans of the
administration, but by revising or defeating them as conspicuously as
possible \-- by amending or rewriting administration drafts of bills,
joint resolutions or committee reports; by suggesting dramatic or
hostile lines of questioning to their principals for committee hearings;
and by producing committee reports and draft speeches intended to shape
the legislative history of the bill as it is finally enacted. The
influence of a growing congressional staff on the relations between
Congress and the President has been reinforced by a second source of
[increasing congressional power]{.underline}, the modern political habit
of electing a Democratic Congress and a Republican President. The
[result has been]{.underline} rather [popular with the voters, who
regard it as another check and balance, restraining the malignant
natural impulses of politicians]{.underline}. But the habit has
decidedly negative features as well. [It encourages partisan
irresponsibility on the part of Congress]{.underline} even on major
national issues, [especially in foreign affairs]{.underline}, and it
constitutes an additional obstacle to rational districting for the House
of Representatives. **[These]{.underline}** two
**[tendencies]{.underline}** together **[produce]{.underline}** a third,
**[[the practice of writing]{.mark}]{.underline}** long and elaborate
**[[statutes intended to control the President]{.mark}
and]{.underline}** the courts in great detail as **[they [apply
statutes]{.mark}]{.underline}** and treaties **[[to new
situations]{.mark}.]{.underline}** \[\*749\] The notion that
legislatures can control the growth of law in such detail is a naive
delusion, but it is widely shared. Thus, a number of statutes \-- the
War Powers Resolution of 1973 and the intelligence oversight
legislation, particularly \-- require the President to report to
Congress and to \"consult\" either with Congress or with named
congressional committees or special groups. In the 100th Congress,
Senators Nunn, Warner, Mitchell and Byrd put forward a proposal to
revise the War Powers Resolution by eliminating its legislative veto
provisions as obviously unconstitutional, but substituting a requirement
that the President consult with a fixed group representing committees in
both Houses before using or threatening to use the armed forces. The
proposal has been resubmitted to the 101st Congress. The cure would be
far worse than the disease. As sponsors of such legislation freely
concede, the purpose of the **[requirements]{.underline}** is not
\"reporting\" or \"consulting,\" but [putting Congress]{.underline} or
small groups of senior members of Congress [into the middle of the
President\'s decision-making process \"as equals.\"]{.underline}
[**[Laws]{.mark}** like this would]{.underline} in fact [give the
congressional leaders a veto over presidential action and thus
**[destroy the unitary Presidency]{.mark}**]{.underline}, one of the two
great innovations of the American Constitution. Finally, [congressional
attacks on the President\'s prerogatives in the field of foreign affairs
draw strength from]{.underline} widespread [protest against the foreign
policy]{.underline} the United States has pursued since 1945. That
protest is based on a nostalgic yearning for the neutrality and
comparative isolation of the United States during the century between
1815 and 1914. It is an important factor both in American domestic
politics and in American foreign policy, despite its irrationality. [The
constitutional balance between Congress and the Presidency cannot be
restored without vigorous action by Presidents to defend the
Presidency]{.underline} and by equally vigorous judicial intervention.
Two principal reasons explain the weakness of the defending forces thus
far. Recent Presidents have hesitated to challenge the congressional
claims of supremacy directly, because they have felt vulnerable to
congressional reprisals in many forms, and **[[Congress, with the smell
of victory in its nostrils, has been in the mood to inflict
reprisals]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Moreover, during most of the Reagan
administration, the Justice Department tended to agree with the premise
of congressional supremacy, or at any rate to agree with the view that
such conflicts should be settled by political bargaining, and not by an
\"activist\" Supreme Court.

[**[reduce confidence]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}]{.underline} thus trigger

short, [[create a **self-fulfilling crisis of authority**]{.mark} [that
puts legislative institutions under tremendous pressure]{.mark} to
accede to executive demands]{.underline}, at least where a crisis is
even plausibly alleged. Critics of executive power contend that the
executive exploits its focal role during crises in order to bully and
manipulate Congress, defeating Madisonian deliberation when it is most
needed. n203 On an alternative account, the legislature rationally
submits to executive leadership because a crisis can be addressed only
by a leader. [[Enemies are **emboldened** by **institutional

to the Treasury secretary and Fed chairman who, acting in tandem, did
not once express disagreement publicly.

THE IMPORTANCE OF CONGRESSIONAL APPEALS/DISSENT Because they are legally
binding, legislation and appropriations passed by Congress directly
impinge on a president's discretion to wage war. Not surprisingly, then,
[opponents of a president's war typically call on
**Congress**]{.underline} to pass laws and cut appropriations. [But the
public debates that precede military actions]{.underline} also
[have]{.underline} **[important consequences]{.underline}** [for
presidential power]{.underline}. Two stand out. By expressing
**[dissent]{.underline}**, members of Congress [can weaken the
president's ability to **credibly convey resolve**]{.underline} to
foreign allies and adversaries, [and they can turn]{.underline}
**[public opinion]{.underline}** [against him]{.underline}.73 Here, we
briefly summarize both of these avenues of congressional influence.
SIGNALING RESOLVE To the extent that [congressional]{.underline}
**[discontent]{.underline}** [signals]{.underline} domestic
**[irresolution]{.underline}** to other nations, the job of resolving a
foreign crisis is made all the more difficult. As Kenneth Schultz shows,
[an "opposition party can undermine the credibility of]{.underline} some
[challenges by publicly opposing them.]{.underline} Since [this strategy
threatens to increase the probability of]{.underline} **[resistance
from]{.underline}** the **[rival state]{.underline}**, it forces the
government to be more selective about making threats"---and,
concomitantly, more cautious about actually using military force.74 When
members of Congress openly object to a planned military operation,
[would-be adversaries of the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [may feel]{.underline} [**emboldened**,
believing that the president lacks]{.underline} the **[domestic
support]{.underline}** [required to see a military venture through. Such
nations, it stands to reason, will be]{.underline} [**more willing to
enter conflict**, and if convinced that the United States will back
down]{.underline} once the costs of conflict are revealed, [they
may]{.underline} **[fight longer]{.underline}** and make fewer
concessions. [Domestic political strife]{.underline}, as it were,
[weakens the ability of presidents to]{.underline} **[bargain
effectively]{.underline}** [with foreign states, while increasing the
chances that **military entanglements abroad**]{.underline} [will become
**protracted**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[unwieldy]{.underline}**. A large body of work within the field of
international relations supports the contention that a nation's ability
to achieve strategic military objectives in short order depends, in
part, on the head of state's credibility in conveying political resolve.
Indeed, a substantial game theoretic literature underscores the
importance of domestic political institutions and public opinion as
state leaders attempt to credibly commit to war.75 [Confronting
widespread and vocal domestic opposition, the president may have a
difficult time signaling his willingness to see a military campaign to
its end. While congressional opposition may **embolden foreign
enemies**, the perception on the part of **allies** that the president
lacks support may make them wary of committing any troops at all. The
dangers of domestic political dissent are not lost on
presidents]{.underline} and members of Congress. Indeed, for Bush (43)
it constituted an important reason for seeking congressional
authorization to use force against Iraq in the fall of 2002. In a Rose
Garden ceremony on October 2, the president noted, "The statement of
support from the Congress will show to friend and enemy alike the
resolve of the United States. In Baghdad, the regime will know that full
compliance with all U.N. security demands is the only choice and that
time remaining for that choice is limited."76 Then, in remarks eight
days later on the House's vote to authorize the use of force, the
president proclaimed, "The House of Representatives has spoken clearly
to the world and to the United Nations Security Council: The gathering
threat of Iraq must be confronted fully and finally. Today's vote also
sends a clear message to the Iraqi regime: It must disarm and comply
with all existing U.N. resolutions, or it will be forced to comply.
There are no other options for the Iraqi regime. There can be no
negotiations. The days of Iraq acting as an outlaw state are coming to
an end."77 By securing congressional authorization, it was supposed, the
president could communicate his views and intentions more effectively to
the international community that Iraq's defiance of United Nations
resolutions would no longer pass unnoticed.78 In doing so, it was hoped,
Saddam Hussein would finally relent to Bush's demands. Imagine what
might have happened during the lead-up to and execution of the Iraq War
had Congress not authorized the use of force. Two outcomes seem
plausible, even likely. First, the president would have had an even more
difficult time assembling an international coalition in support of
military action. Recall, after all, that the president expressly sought
congressional authorization in the hopes that it would improve the
chances of later securing a UN Resolution in support of military action.
Second, and in a more speculative vein, had Congress not authorized the
use of force, the military operation itself might not have gone so
smoothly. During the early stages of the Iraq War, the U.S. military
took pains to persuade the enemy to lay down its arms and surrender,
rather than fight and face certain death. Accompanying these claims were
regular assurances that the United States would see this war through to
the end, that it would not stop until the entire Hussein regime was
dismantled. To substantiate these claims, Congress's authorization was
critical. For a moment, put yourself in the place of an Iraqi field
officer in the spring of 2003. On the one hand, the United States
military is bearing down upon you, threatening to kill you and every one
of your comrades unless you abandon the fight. On the other hand, should
you surrender prematurely, and [should the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [fail]{.underline} to depose the Hussein regime,
[then you can expect to face the]{.underline} **[wrath of a spurned and
spiteful ruler]{.underline}**---as the southern Shi'a did a decade
prior, after they had risen up in defiance of the Hussein regime only to
be persecuted the moment that U.S. troops withdrew. Which option seems
preferable critically depends on the likelihood that the United States
will see the campaign to its end. For [if you have reason to doubt the
nation's resolve, and Congress's refusal to authorize the use of force
would **buoy this concern**]{.underline}, then the latter option might
be the right one---producing a longer, bloodier military conflict and
raising the cost to an invading army. Similar concerns arose in
subsequent years when the United States contemplated troop withdrawals
from Iraq. Though the insurgency continued to take its toll on U.S.
forces, the president's popularity waned, and calls for the Iraqi
government to police its own state intensified, Bush nonetheless refused
to set a firm timetable for troops to leave. And his reasons for doing
so were plain enough. The president insisted that [insurgents
were]{.underline} **[watching U.S. politics closely]{.underline}** and
that [a]{.underline} **[timetable]{.underline}** [would encourage the
insurgents to "just **go ahead and wait us out**]{.underline}." Setting
a fixed withdrawal date, Bush concluded, simply "concedes too much to
the enemy."79 Whether this prediction was accurate or not, its logic
relied on the realization that [others **monitor U.S. politics
generally**, and **Congress in particular**, to gauge the nation's
resolve.]{.underline}

### 4^th^ Gen Conflict -- 2NC

#### Executive branch is key to stopping global terrorism, rogue states, and nuclear proliferation

**Royal, Institute of World Politics, 2011**

(John-Paul, "War Powers and the Age of Terrorism",
<http://cspc.nonprofitsoapbox.com/storage/Fellows2011/Royal-_Final_Paper.pdf>)

[The international system]{.underline} itself and national security
challenges to the United States in particular, [underwent rapid and
significant change in the first decade of the twenty-first
century.]{.underline} War can no longer be thought about strictly in the
terms of the system and tradition created by the Treaty of Westphalia
over three and a half centuries ago. [[Non-state actors]{.mark} now
**[possess a level of destructiveness formerly enjoyed only by nation
states]{.mark}.** Global [terrorism, coupled with]{.mark}]{.underline}
the threat of **[[w]{.underline}]{.mark}**eapons of
**[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**ass **[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**estruction
developed organically or obtained from rogue regimes, [[presents new
challenges]{.mark} to U.S. national security]{.underline} and place
innovative demands on the Constitution's system of making war. In the
past, as summarized in the 9/11 Commission Report, threats emerged due
to hostile actions taken by enemy states and their ability to muster
large enough forces to wage war: "Threats emerged slowly, often visibly,
as weapons were forged, armies conscripted, and units trained and moved
into place. Because large states were more powerful, they also had more
to lose. They could be deterred\" (National Commission 2004, 362). This
mindset assumed that peace was the default state for American national
security. [Today however, we know that threats can emerge quickly.
[Terrorist organizations]{.mark}]{.underline} half-way around the world
[[are able to wield weapons]{.underline} **[of unparalleled destructive
power]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [These attacks are]{.underline} more
[**difficult to detect** and deter due to their unconventional and
asymmetrical nature]{.underline}. [In light of these]{.underline} new
asymmetric [threats]{.underline} and the resultant changes to the
international system, [peace can no longer be considered the default
state of American national security.]{.underline} Many have argued that
the Constitution permits the president to use unilateral action only in
response to an imminent direct attack on the United States. [In the
emerging security environment described above]{.underline}, [pre-emptive
action taken by the executive]{.underline} branch [may be needed more
often than when nation-states were the principal threat to American
national interests.]{.underline} Here again, the 9/11 Commission Report
is instructive as it considers the possibility of pre-emptive force
utilized over large geographic areas due to the diffuse nature of
terrorist networks: In this sense, 9/11 has taught us that terrorism
against American interests "over there" should be regarded just as we
regard terrorism against America "over here." In this sense, the
American homeland is the planet (National Commission 2004, 362).
Furthermore, the report explicitly describes the global nature of the
threat and the global mission that must take place to address it. Its
first strategic policy recommendation against terrorism states that the:
U.S. government must identify and prioritize actual or potential
terrorist sanctuaries. For each, it should have a realistic strategy to
keep possible terrorists insecure and on the run, using all elements of
national power (National Commission 2004, 367). Thus, [fighting
continues against terrorists in Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, Pakistan, the
Philippines, and beyond]{.underline}, as we approach the tenth
anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks. [Proliferation
of]{.underline} weapons of mass destruction
([[WMD]{.underline}]{.mark}), [especially nuclear]{.underline} weapons,
[[into the hands of these terrorists]{.mark} **[is the most dangerous
threat to the United States]{.mark}**.]{.underline} We know from the
9/11 Commission Report that Al Qaeda has attempted to make and obtain
nuclear weapons for at least the past fifteen years. [Al Qaeda considers
the acquisition of]{.underline} **[w]{.underline}**eapons of
**[m]{.underline}**ass **[d]{.underline}**estruction [to be]{.underline}
a religious **[obligation]{.underline}** [while]{.underline} "[more than
two dozen other terrorist groups are pursing CBRN]{.underline}
\[chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear\]
[materials]{.underline}" (National Commission 2004, 397). Considering
these statements, [rogue regimes that are openly hostile to the United
States and have or seek to develop nuclear weapons
capability]{.underline} such as North Korea and Iran, [or **extremely
unstable**]{.underline} [nuclear countries such as
Pakistan]{.underline}, [pose a special threat to American national
security interests]{.underline}. These nations were not necessarily a
direct threat to the United States in the past. Now, however, due to
proliferation of nuclear weapons and missile technology, they can
inflict damage at considerably higher levels and magnitudes than in the
pas[t]{.underline}. In addition, [these regimes may pursue proliferation
of nuclear weapons and missile technology to other nations and to allied
terrorist organizations]{.underline}. [[The United States must
pursue]{.underline}]{.mark} condign punishment and appropriate,
[**[rapid action]{.underline}** [against]{.underline} [hostile terrorist
organizations, rogue]{.underline} [nation]{.underline}
[states]{.underline}]{.mark}[, and nuclear weapons proliferation
threats]{.underline} in order [to protect American
interests]{.underline} both at home and abroad. [Combating these threats
are the "top national security priority for the United
States]{.underline}...with the full support of Congress, both major
political parties, the media, and the American people" (National
Commission 2004, 361). [[Operations may take the form of **pre-emptive
and sustained** action]{.mark} against those who have expressed
hostility or declared war on the United States]{.underline}. **[[Only
the executive branch can effectively execute this
mission]{.underline}]{.mark}**, authorized by the 2001 AUMF. If the
national consensus or the nature of the threat changes, Congress
possesses the intrinsic power to rescind and limit these powers.

### A2: Executive Not Accountable

#### The executive is comparatively more accountable

**Eisner, Cornell law professor, 2001**

(Oren, "Extending Chevron Deference to Presidential Interpretations of
Ambiguities in Foreign Affairs and National Security Statutes Delegating
Lawmaking Power to the President", January,
<http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2835&context=clr>)

[[Federal judges]{.underline}]{.mark} - **[who [have no
constituency]{.mark}]{.underline}** - [have a duty to respect legitimate
policy choices made by those who do.]{.underline} The responsibilities
for assessing the wisdom of such policy choices and resolving the
struggle between competing views of the public interest are not judicial
ones: \"Our Constitution vests such responsibilities in the political
branches.\" 121 [[The judiciary]{.mark},]{.underline} according to
Chevron, \"[[is an inappropriate body to make the kinds of policy
choices]{.mark} that are unavoidable in construing contemporary
regulatory statutes]{.underline}.\" 122 The justification for deference
voices fundamental concerns about legitimacy and \"echoes the Lockean
view \[\*433\] that the exercise of power in a democratic government can
be defined only through accountability to its source, the electorate.\"
123 [[The President is clearly more democratically accountable than the
courts or the executive agencies]{.underline}]{.mark}. First, at least
in their first term, [[Presidents are certainly very accountable to the
voters because they seek re-election]{.underline}]{.mark} - a source of
accountability not shared with either the courts or the agencies. Even
[second term Presidents remain accountable assuming that they prefer
their party to retain control of the executive]{.underline}. Second,
[[the]{.mark} very [fact that Presidents are elected and not
appointed,]{.mark} as judges and agency administrators are, [already
creates democratic accountability]{.mark} because the elected President
and the President\'s views and policies presumably reflect the
preferences of the voter]{.underline}s. Appointed courts, on the other
hand, are accountable to no one, and at best, reflect only the
preferences of the President, and are twice removed from the voters.
Similarly, the agencies are only accountable to the President and are
also twice removed from the voter. Chevron\'s rationale of democratic
accountability therefore applies even more strongly to the President
than it does to agencies, because the principle of democratic
accountability applies even more strongly to the President than it does
to the agencies.

#### No groupthink -- nonfalsifiable and no studies

Anthony **Hempell 4** \[User Experience Consulting Senior Information
Architect, "Groupthink: An introduction to Janis\' theory of
concurrence-seeking tendencies in group work.,
http://www.anthonyhempell.com/papers/groupthink/, March 3\]

[[In the thirty years since Janis first proposed the groupthink
model,]{.underline} **[there is]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[still [little
agreement as to]{.mark} the [validity]{.mark} of the model in assessing
decision-making behaviour]{.underline}** (Park, 2000). **[[Janis\'
theory]{.underline}]{.mark}** is often criticized because it **[[does
not present a framework that is suitable for empirical
testing]{.underline}]{.mark}**; instead, the evidence for groupthink
comes from largely qualitative, historical or archival methods
(Sunstein, 2003). Some critics go so far as to say that **[Janis\'s
[work relies on \"anecdote, casual observation, and intuitive appeal
rather than rigorous research]{.mark}]{.underline}**\" (Esser, 1998,
cited in Sunstein, 2003, p.142). [While some studies have shown support
for the groupthink model,]{.underline} the **[support tends to be mixed
or conditional]{.underline}** (Esser, 1998); some studies have revealed
that a closed leadership style and external threats (in particular, time
pressure) promote groupthink and defective decision making (Neck &
Moorhead, 1995, cited by Choi & Kim, 1999); **[the effect of group
cohesiveness is still inconclusive]{.underline}** (Mullen, Anthony,
Salas & Driskel, 1994, cited by Choi & Kim, 1999). [[Janis\'s]{.mark}
model tends to be supported by [studies]{.mark} that [employ a
qualitative case-study]{.mark}]{.underline} [[approach **as opposed to
experimental research**]{.mark}**, which tends to either partially
support or not support Janis\'s thesis**]{.underline} (Park, 2000). The
lack of success in experimental validation of groupthink may be due to
difficulties in operationalizing and conceptualizing it as a testable
variable (Hogg & Hains, 1998; Park, 2000). Some **[[researchers]{.mark}
have [criticized Janis for categorically denouncing groupthink]{.mark}
as a negative phenomenon]{.underline}** (Longley & Pruitt, 1980, cited
in Choi & Kim, 1999). Sniezek (1992) argues that **[[there are instances
where concurrence-seeking may promote group
performance]{.underline}]{.mark}**. When used to explain behaviour in a
practical setting, **[groupthink has been frames as a detrimental group
process; the result of this has been that many corporate training
programs have created strategies for avoiding groupthink in the
workplace]{.underline}** (Quinn, Faerman, Thompson & McGrath, 1990,
cited in Choi & Kim, 1999). Another criticism of groupthink is that
Janis overestimates the link between the decision-making process and the
outcome (McCauley, 1989; Tetlock, Peterson, McGuire, Chang & Feld, 1992;
cited in Choi & Kim, 1999). [Tetlock et al argue that there are many
other factors between the decision process and the outcome. [The outcome
of any decision-making process]{.mark}]{.underline}, they argue, [[will
only have a certain probability of success due to]{.mark} various
[environmental factors]{.mark}]{.underline} (such as luck). A
large-scale study researching decision-making in seven major American
corporations concluded that [decision-making worked best when following
a sound information processing method]{.underline}; however these groups
also showed signs of groupthink, in that they had strong leadership
which attempted to persuade others in the group that they were right
(Peterson et al, 1998, cited in Sunstein, 2003). Esser (1998) found that
groupthink characteristics were correlated with failures; however
[cohesiveness did not appear to be a factor:]{.underline} groups
consisting of strangers, friends, or various levels of previous
experience together did not appear to effect decision-making ability.
[Janis\' claims of insulation of groups and groups led by autocratic
leaders did show that these attributes were indicative of groupthink
symptoms. [Moorhead & Montanari conducted a study]{.mark} where [they
concluded]{.mark} that [groupthink]{.mark} symptoms [had no]{.mark}
significant [effect on group performance]{.mark}]{.underline}, and that
\"the relationship between groupthink-induced decision defects and
outcomes were not as strong as Janis suggests\" (Moorhead & Montanari,
1986, p. 399; cited by Choi & Kim, 1999). [Overall, the
[groupthink]{.mark} hypothesis appears to be valuable as a
descriptive,]{.underline} analytic and heuristic tool (Esser, 1998)
[**but [is not a good model for empirical testing]{.mark};** it attempts
to explain a complex phenomenon but is **difficult to operationalize
into testable variables**]{.underline}. While some areas of Janis\'
theory have been supported by empirical or experimental, others remain
ambiguous or even contradictory (Sunstein, 2003). When reading the
assessments of others, [it begs the question of whether groupthink is
suited to being used as a model for empirical analysis:]{.underline} is
it fair to measure groupthink theory on the basis of laboratory tests,
when in real life groupthink occurs within a complex and volatile
environment? Janis\'s original method was one of inductive reasoning
from archival records and case studies; perhaps it is better left as a
qualitative model that can help illuminate the inexact spheres of
organizational behaviour and communications theory.

#### Congress [doesn't]{.underline} improve decision-making.

**Nzelibe 7** \[Jide Nzelibe (Asst. Professor of Law @ Northwestern);
"Are Congressionally Authorized Wars Perverse?"; *Stanford Law Review*:
Vol. 59, 2007;
<http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=952490>\]

Contrary to the received wisdom, this [experimental Article advances the
empirically plausible assumption that [congressional authorization of
the use of force might]{.mark} actually have a perverse
effect.]{.underline} Thus, [rather than create a drag effect that
minimizes the impulse to rush into imprudent wars, congressional
authorization might]{.underline} actually [do the
**opposite**]{.underline}: because such [authorization allows the
President to **spread the potential political costs** of military
failure or stalemate to other elected officials, it will [lead the
President to **select into more high risk wars**]{.mark} [than]{.mark}
he would otherwise choose [if he were acting
unilaterally]{.mark}.]{.underline} In other words, [[since
congressional]{.mark} [authorization]{.mark} acts as a political
"insurance policy" that]{.underline} partially [**[protects the
President against]{.mark} the possible political [fallout from a
military misadventure,]{.mark}** [he is]{.mark}]{.underline} likely to
be [**more [willing to engage in wars]{.mark}** [where the]{.mark}
expected [**outcome** is **uncertain**]{.mark}]{.underline}. More
importantly, not only is the President likely to use congressional
authorization as a hedge to prevent future political opponents from
exploiting his misfortunes, he is also likely to use it to protect
members of his party in Congress who are more likely to be electorally
vulnerable in the absence of such authorization. While this notion of
[[congressional authorization as **political
insurance**]{.underline}]{.mark} might appear puzzling, it [makes
sense]{.underline} when understood [as a cheap mechanism designed to
protect a vulnerable President]{.underline} or ruling party [from the
insecure political atmosphere]{.underline} that [is]{.underline} [likely
to exist in the aftermath of a high risk conflict.]{.underline}
Significantly, [two factors]{.underline} operate in tandem to
[ensure]{.underline} that [the]{.underline} initial Presidential
[decision to seek congressional authorization will not be]{.underline}
particularly [costly]{.underline} from a political perspective. First,
[since a member of Congress is likely to have less information than the
President about the likely outcome of a high risk conflict, he or [she
is **likely to defer to the President's judgment**]{.mark} that the
conflict will have a positive outcome and hope to ride the President's
electoral coattails]{.underline} as voters rally around the flag. Thus,
[[the]{.mark} purported]{.underline} institutional [[benefit of
deliberation by multiple voices]{.underline}]{.mark} that congressional
authorization is supposed to confer [[is]{.mark} likely to be
**[trivial, if not non-existent]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Second, [since
the electoral consequences of voting against a successful war are likely
to be dearer than voting for a losing war, [the President is
**relatively assured** of getting a favorable vote to use
force]{.mark}]{.underline} from those members of Congress who are
elected from swing districts. In sum, seeking congressional
authorization for the use of force becomes a tradeoff in which
Presidents are willing to accept the relatively low short-term costs of
involving other elected officials in the war decision-making process in
