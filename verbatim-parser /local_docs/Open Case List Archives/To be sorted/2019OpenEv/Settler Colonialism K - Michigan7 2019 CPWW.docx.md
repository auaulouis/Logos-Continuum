Settler Colonialism and Accumulation without Reproduction [The
"sovereign effects" of financial capital]{.underline}, which [has now
acquired an unprecedented capacity to dictate policies]{.underline}
"[from above]{.underline}," sustain the analogy referred to above. These
processes are often referred to as instances of ongoing "primitive
accumulation," and their violent character does supersede the "silent
compulsion of economic relations" (Marx 1976, 899). But [settler
colonialism, as a mode of domination that produces specific social
formations, and primitive accumulation are intimately
related]{.underline}.10 Gabriel Piterberg and I sketched this relation
in a Journal of Global History essay: [primitive accumulation was
"discovered"]{.underline} by Marx [through]{.underline} Edward Gibbon
Wakefield's [reflection on the ways in which the availability of "free"
lands in settler-colonial contexts was undoing the previous separation
of workers from their means of subsistence]{.underline} and was
[rendering]{.underline} what he called "[capitalist civilisation"
unworkable]{.underline} (Piterberg and Veracini 2015). Marx, after all,
approached capitalism's "secret" in Capital's chapter 33 by looking at
the settler colonies, not the industrialized cores of the developing
global economy. He [assumed]{.underline} that the [indigenous
peoples]{.underline} of these colonies [had already
disappeared]{.underline}, but while [this neglect should not be
repeated]{.underline}, [keeping in mind the fate of indigenous peoples
vis-à-vis expanding settler orders enables an original reframing of
primitive accumulation]{.underline}. True, primitive accumulation does
not necessarily lead to elimination and containment, but it does so
increasingly. One point that [debates over "new" enclosures have failed
to address is that they are referring to]{.underline} [a]{.underline}
very [particular]{.underline} [type]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
[primitive]{.underline} [accumulation]{.underline} (see, e.g., de
Angelis 2004). It may be [called accumulation without
reproduction]{.underline}. Geroge CiccarelloMaher (2016) recently called
it "[dispossession without labour]{.underline}." He was responding to an
important intervention on this topic by indigenous Marxist Canadian
scholar Glen Coulthard (see, e.g., Coulthard 2014). Primitive
accumulation is a process that is typically seen as equally designed to
force people into the wage relation as well as to enable the
appropriation of land and resources (see Nichols 2015). This is so
whether one agrees with the "orthodox" school and sees it as a
historically completed process or whether, on the contrary, one sees it
as an ongoing phenomenon. Marx saw the creation of a waged labor force
as a necessary precondition of capital accumulation (and so did
Wakefield, a serial founder of settler colonies as well as a
perspicacious observer of their development), but [indigenous peoples
under settler colonialism are typically forced onto reservations, not
into selling their labor; their labor remains a secondary
consideration]{.underline}. To use Theodor Herzl's (1960, 88)
expression, indigenous peoples should be "spirited" across the border by
way of "procuring employment" elsewhere (Herzl would also become a
founder of settler colonies, even though when he confessed the preceding
to his diary he was still thinking about Argentina as a suitable
location for what would become Zionist endeavors). In other words,
indigenous peoples should be "worked" across the frontier. This should
be done "circumspectly," Herzl added, producing a subdued variation on
the typical settler-colonial theme of "Manifest Destiny." This was an
explicit articulation of accumulation without reproduction, of a type of
accumulation that is originary and final at once. Here the distinction
between "disposable labor" (which sits conceptually at the threshold
between exploitation and elimination) and "disposable populations"
should be brought to the fore: while the borderlands between the two are
flexible and mutating, the former is useful to capitalist accumulation,
the latter are not. Citing Capital and observing simultaneous processes
of primitive accumulation and settler colonization in nineteenth-century
Japan, Katsuya Hirano (2015, 209) has expanded on this point:
[Disposable labor "forms an element of the floating surplus population";
some of these individuals emigrate and thus follow the flow of capital.
Disposable labor therefore becomes either a "constant latent surplus
population"]{.underline} in the countryside passively waiting to be
employed by capitalists in cities [or a "stagnant population" that
"offers capital an inexhaustible reservoir of disposable
laborpower]{.underline}." ... In short, the [disposability of the
industrial reserve]{.underline} army [of labor]{.underline} [does not
point to the workers' sentence to death but to the state in which they
are kept alive so that they remain available and functional]{.underline}
[as]{.underline} a 124 Veracini cheap [commodity for capitalists to
purchase and exploit]{.underline}. On the [contrary, **the
dispensability of an indigenous population implies its absolute
redundancy**]{.underline}. This [distinction is crucial: under settler
colonialism, biopolitics becomes "thanatopolitics," and the biopolitical
governance of bodies linked to the extraction of surplus value out of
naked life becomes a circumstance wherein surplus value is no
longer]{.underline} the [primary]{.underline} concern.11 This is also
when [settler colonialism and "racial capitalism" manifest themselves in
their intimate imbrication]{.underline}---[one would not exist without
the other]{.underline} (see Robinson 1999).12 Focusing on a related
aspect of this distinction, Coulthard (2010, 81) argued a similar point
when he noted that indigenous peoples are subjected to spacebased
processes of accumulation while other workers are subjected to timebased
forms of exploitation (i.e., the theft of time, or surplus value). That
contemporary forms of accumulation by dispossession involve primarily
the appropriation of physical and symbolic public space; that these
dispossessions typically operate through a denial of access; that
spatial dispossession may not even require physically displacing
dispossessed collectives;13 and that, as its etymology suggests,14
access is especially about space are all important considerations.15
Robert Nichols (2015, 20) has recently called for taking space seriously
while talking about primitive accumulation. Revisionist accounts of
primitive accumulation, he notes, have "exploded in the past decade or
so." This explosion resulted in a certain conceptual shattering,
throwing forth a range of ambiguously related companion concepts such as
"accumulation by displacement," "dispossession by displacement,"
"accumulation by encroachment," and "accumulation by denial." Perhaps
most influentially, David Harvey speaks of "accumulation by
dispossession." While offered as a synonym for primitive accumulation,
in Harvey's rendering "accumulation by dispossession" is essentially a
stand-in for privatization: "the transfer of productive public assets
from the state to private companies," especially as a result of the
supposed over-accumulation of capital in neoliberal times. The category
is thus shorn from any connection to the transition debates or, indeed,
from any particular connection to land. (20) 11. [Tanathopolitics may be
distinguished from necropolitics]{.underline} (see Mbembe 2003).
Necropolitics is still related to biopolitical forms of control;
[tanathopolitics is a type of control that can be conceived as entirely
dedicated to the elimination of targeted populations]{.underline}. While
Nichols does not discuss Harvey's thesis about a "temporal-spatial fix,"
which does consider land, he intends to focus especially on land and
remarks that recent work on primitive accumulation and exploitation has
shifted the temporal framework provided in Capital (i.e., the "stages"
of capitalist development) to a spatial one. He summarizes: "We are no
longer operating with a distinction between mature capital and its
prehistory, but with a distinction between core and periphery" (21).
Following on from this spatial turn, Nichols concludes that "rather than
adopting a general expansion of the category of primitive accumulation,
we are better served by reworking the \[Marxian\] notion of Enteignung,"
a "narrower and more precise term" than primitive accumulation.16
"Enteignung ... comes closer to grasping the original intent of the
revisionist theories of primitive accumulation: naming a form of
violence distinct from the silent compulsion of exploitation. Rather
than working with a distinction between general and primitive
accumulation, then, I commend working with a distinction between
exploitation and dispossession" (22). Enteignung---dispossession---is
what we face. But, I would add, drawing a fundamental distinction
between exploitation and dispossession is not only about recognizing the
difference that separates violence and "silent compulsion"; it is also
about exploring the distinction that separates colonialism and settler
colonialism as distinct modes of domination. [Capitalism "disrupts or
disturbs our orientation in space, our place-based
relations,"]{.underline} Nichols adds (25), but [denial of access and
settler colonialism are both primarily focused on the suppression of
"place-based" relations]{.underline}.17 Nichols's argument supports an
appraisal of the settler-colonial present: while he remarks that it is
"possible to recast dispossession as a distinct category of violent
transformation independent of the processes of proletarianization and
market formation," this dispossession is "constitutive and contemporary"
(25, 27). Dispossession is not concerned with reproduction. The "new
enclosures" refer to "any process in which private property is created
through a violent gesture of appropriation" (Mezzadra and Neilson 2013,
295). But while rent extraction is certainly on the rise globally, the
need for an industrial reserve army is no longer as strategic as it used
to be (see Harvey 2003). We are all increasingly required to work, but
wages are less and less meant to recreate us as labor, to allow us to
live healthy lives, to pay for shelter, to purchase medical care and
education. For all that, one can borrow (if one can borrow), but rent
extraction (and debt is ultimately about rent) is famously uninterested
in reproduction, as Marx's analysis of the contradiction pitting the
industrial bourgeoisie and the landed aristocracy famously outlined: the
latter's command over land and its determination to extract rent 16.
Fredric Jameson (2015, 130) has also emphasized land and "the
preponderance of space over time in late capitalism." In our time, he
concluded, "all politics is about real estate," and "postmodern politics
is essentially a matter of land grabs, on a local as well as global
scale." 17. On indigenous life as essentially a form of "place-based
resistance," see for example Alfred and Corntassel (2005). 126 Veracini
ended up redistributing a share of surplus value by forcing
industrialists to pay higher wages and thus sustain the reproduction of
labor (see Felli 2014, 270--1). Rent extraction now, like it was once
for the indigenous peoples who "escaped" proletarianization and forced
or servile labor, no longer diverts surplus value. It used to, but it no
longer does so in a significant way. The contradiction pitting rent and
industrial capital no longer subsists because the latter does not need
to worry about the reproduction of labor power. Previously, the
machinery of debt was aimed at the production of value; today, it is
aimed primarily at appropriation. Debt is being consolidated as a new
technology of governance.18 This is indeed a "systemic transformation."
Debates pitting Harvey's notion of "accumulation by dispossession"
against Giovanni Arrighi's (2007) "accumulation without dispossession"
are compelling but neglect the question of the reproduction of labor
power (or of its absence). My suggestion is that putative "accumulation
without dispossession" in specific locations (i.e., in contemporary
China, as Arrighi observes) and accumulation by dispossession elsewhere
produce "accumulation without reproduction" globally. [Accumulation
without reproduction is a feature that fundamentally characterizes
settler colonialism as a specific mode of domination: the surplus
populations that are to be warehoused and contained look like indigenous
peoples.1]{.underline}9 [Elimination and containment]{.underline} are
not growing everywhere equally---there are areas, especially in the
global South, where the demand for labor and its exploitation is still
expanding (see Kelley 2017)---but they [are growing
globally]{.underline}. Exploitation is still everywhere, but
[containment and elimination, the logic of elimination, are growing
relatively stronger]{.underline}. Tania Murray Li (2010, 71--2) refers,
for example, to contemporary Asia and identifies three "vectors of rural
dispossession in Asia today, none of which has any intrinsic link to the
prospect of labour absorption": these vectors are "seizure of land by
the state, or state-supported corporations," the "piecemeal
dispossession of small-scale farmers," and the "closing of the forest
frontier for conservation." Conservation "absorbs little or no labour,
and the very presence of surrounding populations is viewed as a threat
to 18. Debt as a global consolidating technology of governance that does
not distinguish between different populations is crucial here: it is
meant to discipline all in an undistinguishing fashion ---consumers and
producers, workers and the unemployed. This technique of "public safety"
results from the need to constrain populations rather than unleash their
productive or consuming potential. The "indebted man" (Lazzarato 2012)
is the subject of ever more radical forms of exploitation and is
involved in a system of massive wealth transfer. What Maurizio Lazzarato
does not focus on is that the indebted man is not meant to reproduce
himself. He is produced at a fierce rate, but does not reproduce.
Lazzarato (2015) describes [debt in its current global organization as a
mode of oppression that is meant primarily to contain and discipline
individual and collective subjectivities that are marked as worthless
and somehow culpable.]{.underline} The world's indigenous populations
would know about this predicament. 19. Even though in the case of
Palestine, where these technologies are developed and tested, they
actually are indigenous peoples. On warehousing, see Klein (2007); on
"global Palestine" see Collins (2011). Settler Colonialism 127
conservation objectives" (76). Likewise for land grabs: the
"re-alignment between capital, land and labour in these offshore
production regimes signals a new form of disconnect. The purpose is to
control offshore land and resources. Offshore labour is optional" (75).
But [the global settler-colonial present can be detected beyond a
failure to focus on the reproduction of labor power]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} manifest [inability to face the reality of climate
change despite international attempts to extract rent out of present and
future destruction]{.underline}, for example, [brings the long-term
reproduction of the very conditions of possibility for capitalist
accumulation into question]{.underline} (see Felli 2014).
[The]{.underline} [growing relevance of]{.underline} an "e[cological
debt" can be most productively approached within a
settler-colonial-studies paradigm.]{.underline} After all, recurrent
[narratives of successful settlement in the "New Worlds" are inherently
premised on efficient climate-change adaptation]{.underline}. Grounded
on foundational displacements, **[settler colonialisms are ultimately
and especially about changing climate, about moving from one country to
another, and, conversely, about practicing localized versions of
"ecological imperialism]{.underline}**" (Griffiths and Robin 1997).
Climate, of course, is about more than weather patterns: "climate"
normalizes, as Christina Sharpe (2016, 102--34) has noted, and white
supremacy for example results in a "total climate" that normalizes
premature black death. And climate excludes (see Akaka 2017), and [while
settler colonialism is about changing climates, climate change will in
turn produce new settler colonialisms in a coming "age of
unsettlement]{.underline}" (Fry 2011). [Some will move as refugees,
others will move endowed with a constituent ability]{.underline}. Like
the settlers of old, [the latter will understand their movement as
charged with an inherent sovereign capacity]{.underline}. The [current
neoliberal regime is an exogenous dispossessory regime that penetrates
into the relationships we entertain with others, with our places, and
with ourselves]{.underline}. We are endogenous even if not indigenous.
The recent emergence of "solastalgia," a form of depression linked to
the perception of a changing environment, could be mentioned here.
Connected to environmental changes that challenge "a person's sense of
place and identity and \[that\] can lead to depression," solastalgia is
a concept many indigenous peoples around the world would understand very
well.20

### 1NC -- Ontology

#### Gratuitous violence and the libidinal economy make native life an [oxymoron]{.underline} -- the clearing of [indigenous populations]{.underline} set the [foundations for America]{.underline} -- everything within this world is an [ontological determination]{.underline} structured by [native and black genocide]{.underline} -- this makes the alternative a [pre requisite to evaluating the aff]{.underline}

**Jáurez 15** Nicolas Jáurez is a Native American studies scholar with a
focus on the political ontology of Amerindians within the Western
hemisphere, the settlerist politics of love, and the connections between
racialization and psychopathology. My current research is focused on
Lacanian psychoanalysis and Indigenous cosmology. \["To Kill an Indian
to Save a (Hu)Man:Native Life through the Lens of Genocide"\]//Mberhe

In the first instance, the ontological modality of clearing must be
examined in the ways it comes to shape and define Indigenous life.
[While meditations on Native life as a whole attempt to focus on the
ways in which the potential for culture or sovereignty can resolve the
problems of Redness, these meditations are disrupted by the raw violence
that defines Native American life. That is, the violence of a genocidal
clearing that has come to define what it means to be an
Indian.]{.underline} Arising from the violence of never-ending genocide
is a psychic burden that causes a sense of anxiety that must be
constrained and managed in even the most radical Indigenist texts,
forcing one to tease out the various moments in the theorization of
Native American scholars in which the fires of their works overwhelm
them and fail to be incorporated within the traditional solutions of
postcolonial theory. Various authors touch upon this insolvable aspect
of existence, and it is found most profoundly in the works of Jodi Byrd,
Vine Deloria Jr., Ward Churchill, Frank B. Wilderson III, and Leslie
Marmon Silko, all of whom will be used to supplement our understanding
of Red life. Of these authors, only Wilderson deals with the conditions
of Red life at the highest levels of abstraction and, thus, is the
starting point for analysis. While Wilderson's work on Red existence is
unparalleled, there is a need for a restructuring of his framework. In
his work, Wilderson compartmentalizes the Red ontological position of
clearing into genocide and (the loss of) sovereignty, ultimately failing
to recognize [the nature of Red life as the condition of being cleared a
priori to existence]{.underline}, what Wilderson articulates as the
shift from clearing as a verb to clearing as a noun at the moment of the
"discovery." [This understanding of clearing as the defining aspect of
Redness is seen most profoundly in the Marshall rulings]{.underline},
particularly in Johnson v. McIntosh. Indigenous legal scholar Steven
Newcomb remarks that: ...Marshall noted that Cabot was authorized to
take possession of lands, \"notwithstanding the occupancy of the
natives, who were heathens, and, at the same time, admitting the prior
title of any Christian people who may have made a previous discovery.\"
In other words, [the Court affirmed that United States law was based on
a fundamental rule of the \"Law of Nations\"]{.underline} - that **[it
was permissible to virtually ignore the most basic rights of
indigenous]{.underline}** \"heathens,\" and to claim that the
\"unoccupied lands\" of America rightfully belonged to discovering
Christian European nations. Of course, it\'s important to understand
that, as Benjamin Munn Ziegler pointed out in The International Law of
John Marshall, the term \"unoccupied lands\" referred to \"the lands in
America which, when discovered, were \'occupied by Indians\' but
\'unoccupied\' by Christians\" (emphasis mine). Essential here is that
one understand the ontological structure---the grammar of
suffering---necessary for such a ruling to make sense. The Marshall
rulings ontologically determine Redness from the moment the Settler
meets the Savage. **[For the concept that the United States had eminent
domain over the land to gain coherence it must presume, in the a priori,
that the terra nullius of the Americas always was. Here, Native
Americans emerge barred from sovereignty at the ontological level, and
thus can only be regarded as non-Human occupants. This a priori clearing
becomes the necessary grounding for the Marshall ruling to make sense
because the clearing of land must be scaled to the level of a hemisphere
in order for colonial land-grabbing to even begin to play out within the
Americas]{.underline}**. What this also serves to highlight is the
misdirection that authors such as Wilderson, Deloria, and others point
us towards when they attempt to emphasize Indigenous sovereignty -- that
as far as the Settler is concerned, as far as the world is concerned,
the Red Indian never had sovereignty, never had any claim to the land at
all. Careful examination of the Johnson v. McIntosh ruling further
clarifies this: While the different nations of Europe respected the
right of the natives as occupants, they asserted the ultimate dominion
to be in themselves, and claimed and exercised, as a consequence of this
ultimate dominion, a power to grant the soil while yet in possession of
the natives. These grants have been understood by all to convey a title
to the grantees, subject only to the Indian right of occupancy (emphasis
mine). Here Marshall makes clear that Native American sovereignty never
existed, but rather the existence (and thus the sovereignty) of Native
Americans is decided only within the prerogative of the White Settler.
This ontological structuring echoes throughout history and into the
present, reflected as a defining aspect of Redness at every level of
spatial and temporal cartography. [While the reservation may appear to
be a moment in which the Savage is able to map space into place, that
is, to imbue space with value and have that space resist Human
interventions, it is an illusion.]{.underline} As the Marshall rulings
show, there is never a moment in which the Indian is sovereign.
Furthermore, the fungible locality of the reservation shown through the
Indian Removal Act suggests that not only is the reservation not a
moment in which Indians own land, but the reservation is subject to
movement and displacement at the prerogative of the Settler. Whether it
be forced removal or the gratuitous dumping of radioactive waste on
reservations, the reservation has never been a safe-haven for Red
bodies. The act of clearing is equally applicable to the level of the
individual Red body. **[The gratuitousness of violence committed against
Red bodies, that is, violence that is based not on a prior transgressive
act within the social field, but rather a condition of existence is
expressed over and over as the Indian Savage is murdered again and again
across time and space.]{.underline}** These converging "vectors of
death" (Churchill, A Little Matter of Genocide) meet at the level of the
Red body through co-operative processes of alcoholism, drug abuse,
suicide, mental illness, and abject poverty which, in collusion with
police brutality and violent victimization, work to wipe out Red bodies.
How might one explain such violence? Can any empirical statistic explain
this violence? Red bodies face the second highest rate of police
brutality, the highest rate of violent victimization, they are more than
three times more likely than the average person to die from alcohol
abuse, they have triple the rate of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS),
Native American men are the fastest dying group in the United States,
suicide rates are triple the national rate -- the statistics and the
violence never end.

### 1NC -- Lib econ ev

#### Their politics forwards affective libidinal investments of the settler that requires the extermination of the native this makes the permutation impossible because it is reconciliation of settler politics 

**Kouri and Skott-Myhre 15 **Scott Kouri, University of Victoria,
Hans Skott Myhre, Brock University, \["Catastrophe: a transversal
mapping of colonialism and settler subjectivity", pg 3 -- pg 9\]//Recut
Mberhe

To open the ﬁeld of our own subjectivity as a mode for apprehending
catastrophe means to engage the realm of sense, the ineffable, or, in
psychoanalytic terms, the unconscious. [In the catastrophe of colonial
settlement, the unconscious might well be read in both Freudian/Lacanian
and Deleuzo--Guattarian registers. We use the term Freudian/Lacanian to
indicate a theoretical entangling of Freudian and Lacanian readings of
the genetic unconscious as foundationally representative. In the
Freudian aspect, the unconscious is a space of forbidden representations
of desire, while in the Lacanian it is the space of that which cannot be
articulated. In our Freudian/Lacanian reading, we see the unconscious as
a space of repression in which the term settler signiﬁes both that which
must not be spoken -- because it is forbidden knowledge -- and that
which cannot be spoken -- because it is ineffable, both in the sense
that it is too great or too extreme to be spoken and because it is
taboo.]{.underline} The production of the term settler then holds a very
speciﬁc function within the genocidal project of colonization in North
America in settling and smoothing the massively disruptive effects of
the catastrophe. [Hutchison examines the settler
unconscious]{.underline} via Žižek's reading of Lacan [and proposes that
a psychoanalytic examination of affective investments helps us
understand the unconscious bonds that settlers have to nationalist
discourse.5]{.underline} Using Lacan's concept of jouissance (enjoyment
in Žižek) as his primary heuristic tool, [Hutchison argues that the
settler is constituted by a desire trapped in a dialectic with lack, a
perpetually deferred longing for 'an imaged lost fullness of the nation'
(p. 49). Settler societies are bound by affective investments in an
Other that prevents the realization of this fullness andtherefore
conceals the impossibility of ever attaining it -- as it was never there
-- in the ﬁrst place.]{.underline} Lack therefore comes to manifest
itself in a painful or transgressive enjoyment of the series of
substitutes which come to stand in for the unattainable fullness and the
settler unconscious of illusion only becomes stronger as the fragility
of the original myth is challenged. For Hutchison challenging the
discourse of settler nationalism is insufﬁcient because a transgressive
enjoyment will perpetually fuel the colonial project when the Other can
be imagined to be the threat to the nation's realization of fullness.
The colonial Freudian/Lacanian unconscious that produces the settler in
this way then produces both a mythical subject free of the disruptive
and forbidden activities engaged in during the extensive historical
conquest of Indigenous peoples (European, African, Asian, and North
American) and a mythical event horizon that obscures and eviscerates
memory, producing the settler as innocent and desiring ofdemocracy,
fullness, and opportunity. The colonial unconscious read in this way is
a site of primary repression of that which it is taboo to know. Such an
unconscious produces the settler as an identity-cypher to stand in for a
subjectivity overwhelmed with shame and guilt and in desperate need of a
sociopathic overlay to defer any debt due on the terms of its survival.
[**We, as settlers, must not know, in any existential or
phenomenological sense, the price we have exacted from the land, from
the Other, or from our own desire. R**egan6 masterfully elaborates the
many denials that underlie contemporary Canadian settler consciousness
such as the residential school system and our work here is to provide a
theoretical framework to analyze such denials. It is the nature of the
psychotic delusion of the settler that such knowing must be denied in
the fundamental constitution of identity, and any threat to this
systematic denial must be met with the highest degree of savagery to
sustain our system of paranoiac foreclosure. Under such a foreclosure of
knowledge, the settler must believe that history is in the past and that
any and all harm, trauma, and associated accountability has no
contemporary]{.underline} actuality[.]{.underline} The fact that the
lands that are currently known as North America have been the home of
Indigenous peoples for millennia7 is only of historical interest. It is
something to be taught as an event whose time has passed. The reality of
an alternative sociocultural ecology of living peoples with signiﬁcant
diversity among their different cultures, societies, and language groups
'bound together by a perspective that supports a holistic interdependent
worldview, communal rights and a commitment to sustainable decision
making'8 must be glossed over and homogenized into an element of how we
as settlers manage multiculturalism or human rights. The history of
thousands of years in which Indigenous peoples across Turtle Island9
developed complex and functional systems of politics, economics,
education, health, and spirituality10 is to be reductively and
selectively denied and subsumed within the discourses that valorize
European and American models of democracy and progress. *Veracini here
uses the psychoanalytic concept of the primal scene to interpret settler
disavowal of Indigenous histories and explain the ﬂipped temporalization
which follows when settlers see Indigenous peoples as entering settler
space subsequent to the onset of colonization.*11 Indigenous peoples'
own accounts of their historical origins through creation stories are
produced as quaint, antiquated mythological accounts to be measured
against anthropological and archeological evidence produced and
legitimated by settler science.12 [The Freudian/Lacanian settler
unconscious erases and reconﬁgures the history of contact to foreground
the settler as the origin point for all relations to follow. This
maneuver precludes any history of independent 'intricate systems of
political and commercial alliances'13 among ethnically and
linguistically diverse Indigenous peoples of Turtle Island.]{.underline}
The delusional paranoid constructions derived from the repressive
apparatus of the settler unconscious produce the history of ﬁrst contact
of Indigenous peoples with Europeans through the telling of John Cabot's
meeting with the Beothuk or the voyages of Christopher Columbus. To
derive this construction, the history of Indigenous and non-Indigenous
peoples' interactions across four periods spanning a thousand years14
must be foreclosed and rewritten to create a narrative in which the
colonial project of settlement not only is foregrounded but also becomes
the only story of consequence. Veracini calls this disavowal of
Indigenous presence and history a 'non-encounter' that structures
settler colonialism. As a structure, he adds, settler colonialism erases
the distinction between colony and metropole, and works toward
self-fulﬁllment as a settled state.15 In this telling, conquest and
settlement are inevitable and the resulting set of relations the only
possible outcome. The construction of any history of relationship,
however, has signiﬁcant implications, not just in terms of the accurate
reporting of events, but also in the very production of who we settlers
[imagine ourselves and the Other to be. If we misapprehend and
misconstrue, through repression and denial, key constitutive events that
compose us affectively through our interactions with others, then the
ways in we becomesubjectiﬁed are signiﬁcantly impoverished. In this
sense, the process of reiterating abstract accounts of colonial history
as the development of imperial European institutions and policies in a
new land sanitizes the actual corporeal encounters between
bodies]{.underline}. The production of the subject as settler also
inadvertently opens the realm of abstract colonialism by suggesting that
settler colonialism 'is different from other forms of colonialism in
that settlers come with the intention of making a new home on the land,
a homemaking that insists on settler sovereignty over all things in
their new domain'.16 Here we have a subtle move away from sovereignty as
the province of the imperial state and the introduction of an
individuated subject whose modes of dominance, coercion, and
appropriation are founded, not on the state, whose interests are of
course intertwined, but on the home and family. This home and family
could be interpreted as the home and family of the Freudian/Lacanian
Oedipal/phallic unconscious. Family and home in the vernacular of
psychoanalysis are founded in primary trauma, and the system of rule
deployed in relation to such trauma is founded in the phallic assertion
of the father and the primary space of lack as desire that is the
mother. To produce the home requires an erasure and sublimation of
desire and the dialectic productive capacities of lack. To sustain the
family and the home, the rule of the father must eradicate and clear all
preceding forms of sovereignty and any alternative modes of production.
Settler colonialism, read as such a system of patriarchal rule, is
principally about remapping the land and deploying imperial institutions
and policies that forcibly erase Indigenous presence, traditions, and
life from such maps and from the land itself. Canada and the USA, as
settler colonial states, were predicated on the discourse of terra
nullius, empty land. Lawson describes how in almost unending repetition,
[colonial space is ﬁgured as absence, lack, or emptiness.17 This absence
or lack, in Freudian/Lacanian terms, constitutes the land as the
feminine and is at the heart of the dialectics of desire that utilizes
the anxiety of absence to generate the imaginary and the symbolic. The
dialectics of desire is premised on the lack of phenomenological being
or, in another term, the ineffability of coherent subjectivity.
Producing a new subject within a new world required symbolically
castrating the old world order. The ambivalence of the symbolic
patricide of the old order leaves a residue of shame only partially
resolved by a symbolic return to the new world as an empty space or pure
possibility. If there is no terra nullius, then there is no escape into
a utopic future through the murder of the father.]{.underline} However,
the father, as European Empire, is not yet dead and demands a rebirth
through the symbolic (and literal) rape of the realm of the feminine
that is the new world. This complex set of force relations intersects
with the existing sets of Indigenous relations in entanglements of old
and new, but the dialectic construction of the settler subjectivity is
always to be found in the reading of the Indigenous and all colonial
others as lack that will provide and provision the empty canvas of the
settlement. As Veracini points out 'only a sustained disavowal of any
founding violence can allow a seamless process of territorialisation'.18
It is in these terms that we can come to understand how the British and
French colonists acknowledged First Nations land occupation when it
served their purposes, such as in trade and strategies of war. This
dialectical simultaneous appropriation and evisceration of native
sovereignty was designed to open a clear ﬁeld for the establishment of
the homeland for the settler to settle*.* Alfred explains that during
conﬂicts between the French and British in North America, these powers
needed the alliances of Indigenous nations to defeat one another and
therefore recognized the original sovereignty of Indigenous nations.19
Britain, once it defeated France in the Seven Years War and asserted
control over North America, both recognized Indigenous presence through
the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and simultaneously initiated a systematic
process of removing Indigenous peoples, language, and culture from the
land to proﬁt settler institutions and individuals. The Royal
Proclamation established British rule of French-claimed territory in
North America and determined that the emerging government would have
responsibilities to Indigenous peoples, particularly in land and other
treaty negotiation. By the late nineteenth century, however, 'Canada
decided to abandon its responsibility to settle Treaties'20 and focused
instead on a program of assimilation, community dislocation, and
genocide. Wesley-Esquimaux and Smolewshi explain that, following the
pandemics and wars, 'there would have been no one to stem the tide of
colonialism because so few would have been left standing and those who
survived did not have the strength of mind or body'.21 Already weakened
Indigenous communities could not protect themselves from assimilationist
policies set out in the Indian Act and enacted through such bodies as
the residential school system. Canadian [settler colonization, including
land theft, cultural extermination, the forcible removal of children,
and the deliberate spread of disease and pandemics, was responsible for
the deaths of up to 90% of the Indigenouspopulation and rendered
Indigenous peoples 'physically, spiritually, emotionally and psychically
traumatized by deep and unresolved grief'.22 Clearly what we are
describing here is a catastrophe, and the catastrophe continues today.
As Alfred and Corntassel explain, contemporary settlers follow the
mandate provided for them by their imperial forefathers' colonial
legacy, not by attempting to eradicate the physical signs of Indigenous
Peoples as human bodies, but by trying to eradicate their existence as
peoples through the erasure of the histories and geographies that
provide the foundation for Indigenous cultural identities and sense of
self. In]{.underline} the reading of catastrophe we provided at the
beginning of this writing, we identiﬁed two ways to manage the affective
dislocations of such rupture. Here we see the ﬁrst in full extension:
the appeal to a transcendent outside that delivers us from the contested
and contradictory set of relations that compose the catastrophe as
immanent event and hence divert our attention from the actuality of
rupture. To produce the Other as pure abstraction is to reify the Other
as lack and deny any material and corporeal actuality to their
existence. This erasure of the Other as anything other than a
sociopolitical abstraction to be differentially dealt with through
juridical, ideological, and biopolitical regimes of control and
discipline is an appeal to the transcendent as absolute. Such a move,
however, is not without consequence to the settler as subjectivity in
relation to the Other. It was Freud24 who pointed out that denial of
trauma through repression can only be sustained through ongoing violence
to the integrity of self-production. Put simply, that which is repressed
will surface in ways that warp and distort the autopoietic capacities of
the body. Since trauma always engages the Other repression is always a
collective act centered and focused through the unique and idiosyncratic
capacities of the singular body. **[The logic of settlement as an act of
traumatic erasure that must be repressed through an appeal to the
transcendent so as to elide the corporeal affective horror of genocide
cannot avoid the inevitable radical alienation of the settlers from the
actuality of their own lived experience. In this way the settler is
doomed to live within a simulacrum of family, home, and
culture.]{.underline}** Through the process of settlement, each of these
social institutions becomes a symptom of deep malaise complete with
neurosis and constant slippage into paranoia and delusional thought.
Ironically, the ostensible logic of the settlement project to create
home and family undermines any possibility of actual afﬁliations of
either home or family. Indeed, as Marx and Engels25 and Hardt and
Negri26 point out, the family and home become deep sites of social
corruption that undermine possibilities of love and afﬁliation. It is
not surprising that the colonial project ﬁnds its deepest and most
extensive sovereign logic through the development of capitalism within
settler nations such as the USA. It is, after all, through capitalism
that absolute transcendent simulacra can become the social and cultural
logic of our age. Following Michael Hardt,27 we might note that
capitalism as a cultural logic that eviscerates civil society for the
North American settler extends the very logic of settlement that made
every attempt to eviscerate Indigenous modes of living. Thus the
catastrophe cascades out and leaves none of us unsullied or
invulnerable, as Deleuze and Guattari suggest in relation to another
genocide (or possibly a reasonable extension of the one we are mapping):
It is not only our States but each of us, every democrat, who ﬁnds him
or herself not responsible for Nazism butsullied by it. There is indeed
catastrophe, but it consists in the society of brothers or friends
having undergone such an ordeal that brothers and friends can no longer
look at each other, or each at himself, without a 'weariness,' perhaps a
'mistrust'.28

The Settler Academy and the Politics of Recognition It was [not until
the dawn of the African-American Civil Rights Movement]{.underline}
(1954) [that the underlying justification for institutional exclusion
and segregation of Black students was broadly questioned as incompatible
with the norms of liberal democracy]{.underline}. During this time, [the
university became one of the primary sites of struggle and social
transformation]{.underline}. In "Black Study, Black Struggle," Kelley
recounts [the rich tradition of Black studies as it emerged through the
"mass revolt" of "insurgent intellectuals" committed to the development
of "fugitive spaces" not just outside, but also in opposition to, the
Eurocentric university.]{.underline} He cites the works of James
Baldwin, Ella Baker, Walter Rodney, Frantz Fanon, Angela Davis, Barbara
Smith, C. L. R. James, and Cedric Robinson, among others, as the
"sources of social critique" that helped to inspire alternative spaces
like the Mississippi Freedom Schools. The aim was not simply to offer a
broader, more inclusive curriculum, but rather to design one that
examined power along the axes of race and class, developing "trenchant
critiques of materialism" that helped to challenge "the myth that the
civil rights movement was just about claiming a place in mainstream
society" (Kelley, 2016). [The desire]{.underline}, as articulated by
Kelley, [was not for "equal opportunity in a burning house;" rather,
"they wanted to build a new house."]{.underline} But **[since the
settler university can only "remove to replace," it was not long before
the revolutionary and redistributive aims of Black radicalism were
supplanted by and absorbed within the political project of liberal
pluralism, transposing the anti- capitalist critique with a politics of
recognition]{.underline}**. In other words, **[through the structures of
settler logics]{.underline}**, the **[demands]{.underline}** of
#ConcernedStudent1950 **[are only legible as the desire for recognition
and more "intense inclusion]{.underline}**" (Kelley, 2016). While
[demands for safe spaces, greater diversity, mental health counseling,
curricular representation, and renamed campus buildings are hardly
inconsequential, they also have the potential to function as
inducements]{.underline}. Thus, [just as recognition- based politics
impede Indigenous struggles for decolonization, they also constrain
efforts for more a radical vision for Black study and struggle within
and against the university]{.underline}. In other words, the [settler
state has an array of strategies]{.underline}--- recognition being one
of them--- [to placate dispossessed people while **evading any effort to
change the underlying power structure**]{.underline}. Despite all the
handwringing by university officials, [within the context of the liberal
academy, discourses of recognition garner wide appeal]{.underline} as
they provide a means [for neatly bracketing what are fundamentally
complex and ongoing sets of power relations]{.underline}. Such demands
mark a definitive endpoint to a history of wrongdoing as well as a means
for moving beyond that history (Corntassel & Holder, 2008).
[Consider]{.underline}, for example, [the growing wave of colleges and
universities seeking to reconcile their involvement in the slave
trade]{.underline}. The University of Alabama (2004), the University of
Virginia (2007), and Emory University (2011) have all issued formal
apologies. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill erected a
memorial, Washington and Lee removed all its confederate flags, and the
College of William and Mary launched an investigation into its history
of complicity. Brown University launched one of the most comprehensive
projects that included a commissioned three- year study, an
acknowledgement, a memorial, and an endowment for Providence public
schools. While [the symbolic importance of such projects should not be
underestimated, they should also be understood as a first step toward
restructuring material conditions]{.underline}. For example, consider
that though it has been 15 years since the Brown study was launched,
only 7.3% of their student body and 4% of its faculty are currently
African- American. And, no institution to date has offered
reparations.15 Nevertheless, recognition not only continues to serve as
the dominant institutional framework for addressing structural racism
but also, as noted by Kelley (2016, para. 7), [student activists now
parrot the discourses of recognition and thereby unwittingly participate
in their own continued marginalization.]{.underline} A thematic analysis
of the current compilation of student demands from across 70
institutions shows that 88% demanded either changes to curricula or
diversity training (especially for faculty); 87% demanded more support
for students of color (i.e., multicultural centers, residence halls,
financial aid, mental health services); 79% demanded greater faculty
diversity; and 24% desire apologies and acknowledgments.
[This]{.underline} breakdown su[ggests that the central organizing
principal for demands is indeed the desire for a more "hospitable"
institution.]{.underline} Yet, [it isn't so much the nature of the
demands that Kelley takes issue with but]{.underline} [rather their
persistent framing through the discourses of personal
trauma]{.underline} (emphasis in original) [and the potential to "slip
into" thinking about "ourselves as victims and objects rather than
agents"]{.underline} (Kelley, 2016). In some instances, [faculty have
joined]{.underline} [students]{.underline}, sometimes [issuing their own
demands for recognition]{.underline}. Most often, [faculty demands are
organized around issues of tenure, the exploitation of contingent
faculty, and increasing violations of academic freedom, which
disproportionately impact women and faculty of color.]{.underline} One
of the most recent and widely celebrated texts to narrate both the
struggle and political project of women of color in the academy is
entitled Presumed Incompetent: The Intersections of Race and Class for
Women in Academia (Gutiérrez y Muhs et al., 2012). According to the
authors, [the central aim]{.underline} of the text is [**to provide a
space for women** to "name their wounds in order to heal them" and their
collective demand is for future generations of women of color to enjoy
"more fulfilling, respectful and dignified experiences"]{.underline} (p.
xx). The 30 personal narratives of the contributors each capture the
visceral nature of racism and sexism as played out upon their bodies.
The importance of putting a face to what often goes unnamed and
dismissed cannot be underestimated. This underscores the effect of non-
and misrecognition as not only dehumanizing but also cumulative; as
Kelley notes, the "Trauma is real" (2016, para. 23). While [these aims
are indisputable--- everyone deserves respect and dignified experiences
at work--- the political project seems to end there]{.underline}. Among
the 100- plus recommendations made in the final chapter, "Lessons from
the Experience of Women of Color Working in Academia," none of them
calls for collective action against the neoliberal capitalist or settler
logics that situate women in asymmetric relations of power in the first
place. **[Their main contention is not with the structures and systems
of domination that gave rise to the university, but rather with women's
inability to fully participate in them (and thus have access to the
inducements associated with its recognition]{.underline}**). This aim is
most evident in the following passage: The essays in Presumed
Incompetent point... toward the Third World Feminist recognition that
the business of knowledge production, like the production of tea,
spices, and bananas, has an imperialist history that it has never
shaken. Inventing the postcolonial university is the task of the twenty-
first century. We can only hope that this task of decolonizing American
academia is completed before the tenure track itself disappears.
Otherwise scholars in the next century may confront another ironic
example of women finally rising in a profession just as it loses its
prestige and social value. (Niemann, 2012, p. 499) **[Ultimately, the
demand for belonging and inclusion]{.underline}**--- for presumed
competence--- **[is mobilized through a politics of recognition that not
only legitimates the institutions' power over women of color but also
mistakes the formation of an intellectual elite (even if it is elite of
color) for radical social change]{.underline}**.

#### The aff's theory of change over-invests into research as resistance. The structure of the university is nothing but a reflection of the legal system -- documenting damage done, but lack material change. Knowledge becomes another form of territory to conquer.

Over the past ten years, I have been asking questions about whether
research: **[Is research really the intervention that is
needed?]{.underline}** **[Is research going to make it better or
worse?]{.underline}** **[Is the research going to do what we think it
will do?]{.underline}** If we need it to do something specific, is it
still research? **[Do we really need research, or do we need
organizing?]{.underline}** I have also been asking questions about
whither research: Why are these the questions that we need to ask in
this place? What questions have been asked before, and how satisfying
were the answers? What is the history of inquiry in this place? What
research crimes have been done here, and what forms of knowing have been
dismissed? What questions need to be asked here, even if they cannot be
answered through research? The context of these questions is one in
which stories of pain are highly valued in social science research. That
is, [the research]{.underline} stories that are [considered **most
compelling**]{.underline}, considered **[most authentic]{.underline}**
in social science research, [are **stories of pain and
humiliation**]{.underline}. [Reporting on that pain]{.underline} [with
**detailed qualitative data and in people's "real voices"**]{.underline}
[is supposed to yield **needed** material or political
**resources**]{.underline}; **[this is the prominent]{.underline}** but
unreliable **[theory of change in the academy]{.underline}**. Of course,
settler colonialism, other colonial configurations, white supremacy,
heteropatriarchy, and the pursuit of wealth by some at the expense of
others have indeed caused pain in the lives of real people, which
deserves scrutiny and exposure. It is important that we put settler
state violence under scrutiny---too many Indigenous women are murdered
and missing, and too many Black women are killed in police custody.
This, of course, is part of the configuration of settler colonialism
that requires Indigenous erasure and anti-blackness and containment. In
related writing (Tuck and Yang 2014a), K. Wayne Yang and I presented
three axioms of social science research that ground our analysis of the
need for refusal to inquiry as invasion. The axioms are: [**The
subaltern can speak** but is **only invited** to speak
her]{.underline}/our **[pain]{.underline}**. Drawing from bell hooks's
(1990) observation that **[the academy fetishizes stories of the
violated]{.underline}**, we note that [what passes for subaltern "voice"
in research is **a commodities market for pain narratives**: "**No need
to hear your voice**. **Only tell me about your pain**. **I want to know
your story**"]{.underline} (343). **[There are some forms of knowledge
that the academy does not deserve]{.underline}**. This axiom is the crux
of refusal. **[The university is not universal; rather, it is a colonial
collector of knowledge as another form of territory.]{.underline}**
[There are stories and experiences that **already have their own place,
and placing them in the academy is removal, not respect**]{.underline}.
**[Research may not be the intervention that is needed]{.underline}**.
This axiom challenges the latent theory of change that research---more
academic knowing---will somehow innately contribute to the improvement
of tribes, communities, youth, schools, etc. Though Yang and I have
taken these axioms in other directions in other writings (2014a; 2014b),
in this chapter my reason for bringing them to the fore is to point to
the ways that research relies on unexpressed and often unconsidered
theories of change. I have to note that I am somewhat fixated on
theories of change---many of my writings over the years have tried to
draw attention to the often-overlooked significance of theories of
change in social science research. [Theories of change **may be
hidden**, but they are **at work**]{.underline} [in]{.underline} all
social science research, and likely **[all research. The theory of
change, even if implicit]{.underline}**, [will have implications for
**the directions a project takes**]{.underline}, **[how it begins and
where it ends]{.underline}**, **[who a project is responsible
to]{.underline}**, **[speaking to]{.underline}**, **[and speaking
for]{.underline}**. [The **theory of change**]{.underline} [**shapes how
we think things are known**, **what counts as evidence**, and **what
argumentation style will convince those we want to
convince**]{.underline}. [**The ethical stance of a project is
operationalized by its theory of change**. A theory of change determines
**what is considered data**, **what is considered a finding**, and
**what we share and what we refuse to circulate.**]{.underline} Muscogee
scholar Daniel Wildcat (2001) writes that his collaborative writings
with Dakota philosopher Vine Deloria Jr. on power and place were
concerned with the question, "How shall we live?" This question, how
shall we live? is the driving question of my concerns with theories of
change; the need for justice will outlast my years, and I have children
in this world. I am a mother, and I need time to bathe my children, to
care for them, and help them grow. My attention to theories of change
also intensifies during times of grief, like when my father died
suddenly several years ago, or when a close mentor of mine passed away.
The only way I can talk myself out of grief is to say to myself that
life is long, life is long, even when there is not enough evidence that
it is. How shall we live? How shall I spend my time when I am not
bathing my children? The question of how we shall live becomes even more
striking in the face of almost certain climate-change-driven collapse of
some of the human environments around the world. Whether through the
rising of water tables, fires spreading, ice caps melting, air saturated
with toxins, and wars waged only for oil, the question of how we shall
live has an urgency in the Anthropocene. As an aside, this too should be
linked to the drive for productivity---universities are now setting the
dual aims of shrinking footprints and increasing (faculty) productivity,
not willing to see how those two goals materially compete. I am using
the words "theory of change" to refer to beliefs or assumptions about
how social change happens, is prompted, or is influenced. Much time and
human energy is invested in various political activities---but how is it
that change really happens? This is a question that communities and
individuals may never ask themselves. I am interested in this question
for its pedagogical implications, not as a prescriptive. I do not think
the point of the question is to find the singular best answer but,
instead, to have the conversation, to really have it, together, in all
of its mired contestations. [**Indigenous intellectuals** and
**post-structuralists**]{.underline} [assert that change is
**inevitable**]{.underline}, constant, [but **what is the role of human
agency** in such accounts of **change**]{.underline}, or is there no
role? [In North America, many]{.underline} people [believe]{.underline}
that social [change is achieved through **social movements**, but **what
is it about social movements that yields change?**]{.underline} What
does it mean that social movements take different shapes in different
nation-states, comparing the history of social movements in North
America to Māori movements in New Zealand, for example? [Others
emphasize the importance of **paradigm shifts**]{.underline} and breaks,
[but]{.underline}, invoking an image of a surfer paddling out, [how
might one spend her time while waiting for **the next set of breaks to
accumulate?**]{.underline} In some of my earlier work (Tuck 2009), I was
intent on developing a critique of damage-centred research.
**[Documenting damage]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} [among the **most
common**]{.underline} [theories of change]{.underline} in social
science. [It is a]{.underline} [theory of change that **mimics the legal
system. It is a teleological theory of change**]{.underline} [that
places the Western world]{.underline} and neoliberal ideology **[at the
finish line of societal evolution]{.underline}**. [It is **a colonial
theory of change**]{.underline}, [because it locates **power** and
**control** **outside of communities**]{.underline} [and requires them
to appeal to **the logics of the state**]{.underline} [to get
**piecemeal gains**]{.underline} (though, ironically, as Signithia
Fordham has observed, moral arguments are rarely effective with the
neoliberal state or other authorities \[personal communication\]). **[It
is a powerful idea to think of all of us as litigators, putting the
world on trial, but does it actually work?]{.underline}** [Do the
material and political wins **come through**?]{.underline} And, most
importantly, are the meagre wins worth the long-term costs of thinking
of ourselves as damaged (Tuck 2009)? [When]{.underline} the [wins do not
come through, researchers focus]{.underline} more intently [on the
**effectiveness of the demonstration**]{.underline} (legitimation,
validity), [but **not on the flawed theory of change**]{.underline}.
[The theory of change is **flawed** because i]{.underline}t is a
colonial theory of change that assumes that it is outsiders, not
communities, who hold power to make changes. Further, it [assumes that
those **outsider power** people behave as **a judge or jury** behaves,
and can be convinced by **strong arguments** and **evidence** to give up
power or resources]{.underline}. [**Documenting damage** as a theory of
change]{.underline} [pivots on **humanizing the
oppressed**]{.underline}, or providing evidence of humanity in the face
[and]{.underline} force of oppression. In Toward a Global Idea of Race,
Denise da Silva (2007) turns the proposition of humanizing upside down.
**[Da Silva]{.underline}** [explains that the Western subject is
**entirely conferred**]{.underline} [through **the exercising of
power**]{.underline} [over **affectable others.**]{.underline} The
Western subject exercises power over others, and others cannot exercise
power over it. Others are affected by the power of the Western subject
but cannot exercise power. This produces a dilemma for the Western
subject---an anxiety by which affectability is a contagion. The Western
subject must make itself separate from the others and their
affectability---separate in both time and space. This is Othering and
separating a global project of racialization---the co-production of the
West, and the subject as located in the West. The Western subject is
separated from the Other temporally through the teleology of modernity.
[For da Silva, the **conferring** of]{.underline} human and [humanity
has]{.underline} been/[is]{.underline} **[always already a racial
project]{.underline}**. To be human is to exercise power over those made
Other in this self same process. The human is made universal, and the
Other always particular, always teeming, always yearning Da Silva
observes that this generates two important problems with regard to
humanization as a process of liberation. First, the project of
liberation is tied to becoming human, which is always constructed as
exercising power over others. The second is that the affectable others
must presume that by demonstrating their worthiness, they might be
recognized as human. This notion of being human doesn't pop out of
nowhere; it is tied to a long-standing ordering of life. Sylvia Wynter
asks, [How are we not to think, after **Adam Smith** and
the]{.underline} Scottish School of the [**Enlightenment**, that all
human societies are not **teleologically determined**]{.underline} with
respect to their successive modes of economic production that determine
who they are? How are we not to think [in terms of an ostensibly
**universal human history**]{.underline}, that itself has been
identified as one in which all human societies, without exception, must
law-likely move from hunter-gatherer, to pastoral, to agricultural modes
of material provisioning, to one based on a manufacturing economy?
Therefore, how are we not to think in the same correlated terms of the
telelogically determined hegemony of the bios (i.e., the material)
aspect of our being human? (Wynter quoted in McKittrick 2014, 40)
**[Documenting damage]{.underline}** (Tuck 2009) [is about
**demonstrating worthiness**]{.underline} [to be **recognized as
human**]{.underline} [within a framing of humanity that **requires the
oppression of others**]{.underline}. [In this construction]{.underline}
of power and humanity, **[power is scarce]{.underline}**, there are
limited amounts of it, [and it is **evident** only in **wielding it
above others**]{.underline}. This is what I mean when I say that
documenting damage relies on colonial understandings of power and
change---power is concentrated, scarce, and always external to the
colonized. At the risk of bruising friendships, I also ask that we think
fully about [theories of change that rely on **raising
awareness**]{.underline} or raising visibility. This theory of change
[assumes that people are **unaware of an injustice**]{.underline} or
issue or illness or social calamity---and that in making them more
aware, we ready them to take appropriate action. It is a theory of
pre-change. [It assumes that people will generally **do the right
thing** with **the right information**]{.underline}. It anticipates that
the reason for inaction thus far is missing information, or lack of
depth of understanding of the significance of need. **[Raising awareness
is a cousin theory of change to documenting
damage]{.underline}**---[both]{.underline} often [rely on **circulating
narratives** and **tropes** of **the mutilated body, the broken spirit,
the flooded neighbourhood. Images of destruction compete**]{.underline}
for dollars on Facebook, to wrench the most sympathy for donations, for
charity, [**for compassion**, **for hashtag solidarity**, **for
newsworthiness**, **for value**, **for mattering**]{.underline}. There
is no relationship between the evocativeness of the photograph and the
amount of the donation that goes to those in need. [There is **no
relationship** between **the story of loss** and **the supplies that
come**. So much of what we do to compel change relies on **raising
awareness**. But what if we]{.underline}---as communities, as
collectives---[were to **disbelieve awareness as change**?]{.underline}
[What if]{.underline} we, as Indigenous peoples, as people of colour, as
disenfranchised peoples, believed that our own awareness, **[our own
knowing, is enough]{.underline}** to make change? [What if we **did not
wait** for others to also know]{.underline} but are inspired by our own
knowing? What if we hold true that we are the ones who need to know, and
not others? [What if we believe that we are the ones who can make
change]{.underline}, and that others are not more powerful than us to
effect change? [These]{.underline} are radical [questions]{.underline}
that [throb at what gets **taken for granted**]{.underline} [as the work
**of social justice**, **of organizing**, **of public
scholarship**.]{.underline}

#### The University is founded on anti-black and settler colonial violence -- the ability to research and engage in the university cannot be distanced from its violent past. Refuse the notion that debate or the university are neutral sites, and rather center the injustice of the university for this debate to occur.

some people as **researchable**]{.underline}, **[as objects of
study]{.underline}**? What [**forms of value** are **extracted** and
**accumulated** through **research**]{.underline}, or [by
institutions]{.underline}---colleges and universities---[which
**organize the production of knowledge**]{.underline}? I offer some
preliminary threads to rehistoricize and analytically frame the ethics
of research. [To disrupt the framing of]{.underline} Tuskegee as **[a
mere aberration]{.underline}** of unethical research, [I argue that
**the ethics of research** must critically situate **the histories of
our institutional contexts** and of **knowledge production practices
themselves**]{.underline}. [Through this framework, we can
understand]{.underline} Tuskegee as part of [**broader, racialized
logics of accumulation** enacted in and through **claims to knowledge**
and as such]{.underline}, [require **a different scope** for addressing
the ethics of research]{.underline}. [First, we must consider the way in
which]{.underline} **[the "researchable subject"]{.underline}** was
[articulated with the way in which "**race**" was
promulgated]{.underline} in 18th-century scholarship [as **a rational,
scientific study of human difference.**]{.underline} Wynter (2003)
traces how [**Western nations** increased their **territorial** and
**political expansion** through **secular discourses of "rational
perfection"** which **superseded, without wholly eliminating**, prior
Christian theological discourses of **"spiritual perfection"** as
justifications]{.underline} (pp. 264, 287). [Through]{.underline} what
Fanon calls **[the "colonial vocabulary,"]{.underline}** [Indigenous and
African peoples]{.underline} [were deemed as **lower** in a taxonomic
ordering of humanness**, a "Chain of Being" which**]{.underline}, as
Wynter describes, [correlated to "**differential/ hierarchical degrees
of rationality**"]{.underline} (p. 300). **[The West "placed itself at
the apex" of this chain, creating the conditions of truth and
rationality in its own image]{.underline}** (Wynter, 2003, p. 300).
**[Through this double move, universality---of truth, of knowledge, and
ethics---was both created in the image of and abstracted from the
Eurocentric figure of Man.]{.underline}** Wynter (2003) argues that
[this method of creating the **conditions of power** through knowledge
were **not new strategies**, but integrated into **new forms** of
purportedly 'rational' values]{.underline}, from the spiritual to
scientific, what Wynter short-hands as **[a transition from Man1 to
Man2]{.underline}** . [This new]{.underline} universal human [figure is
**a "bio-economic subject,"**]{.underline} [which establishes **a
particular "genre of being human,"**]{.underline} a human ideal
[organized both through science and capital]{.underline} (p. 318). As
McKittrick (2006) elaborates, Man2 "reconfigured humanness by
[**ideologically re-presenting** itself as **"world" humanness** while
**simultaneously stratifying** economic and political **power through
phenotype**"]{.underline} (p. 126). Surely then, **[the extraction of
life, land, and labor of Indigenous, Black, and variously racialized
communities throughout time could be justified in the service of the
development of more "rational," "civilized" ways of
being]{.underline}**, or so the logics of Whiteness---and the logic of
it's ethics---are organized to function. [The **extraction of value**
from racialized people]{.underline} [took on **a myriad of forms** in
the foundation of the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
and [through a variety of institutions]{.underline}. **[Universities and
colleges were among these institutions]{.underline}**. [The **wealth**
amassed through exploitations of slave labor **funded endowments**,
**financed the construction of buildings**, and **established new
colleges**]{.underline} (Wilder, 2013). Indeed, [these
processes]{.underline} were not unique to private colleges and Ivy
leagues, but [accounts for the formation of **public-land grant
institutions**]{.underline} across the nation, [funded through grants of
**30,000 acres** to each senator and member of the house]{.underline}
(Stein, 2017). As Stein argues, **[the Morrill Act]{.underline}**
(1857), [provided **the conditions of possibility** for public higher
education through]{.underline} [the "**imperatives of accumulation that
were established during colonization**]{.underline}" (2017, p. 1). [Even
the development of **a network of public universities**]{.underline}
into the 19th century thus [relied on **colonial logics** that were
**"scientifically" developed** and **used politically to justify such
processes**. Not only was the wealth of many]{.underline} early
[campuses built through]{.underline} practices of [**land and labor
extraction**, but]{.underline} colleges and [universities]{.underline}
also [played an important role in **consolidating** ideas of **racial
difference as scientific truth**]{.underline} [to **legitimize
racialized violence** within the **broader social and political
development** of the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.
[Institutional leaders on campuses]{.underline} such as the University
of South Carolina (University of South Carolina Library, 2011),
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Chan, 2016) and Yale
University (Peart, 2017), among others, **[were ardent defenders of
slavery]{.underline}**. [Amid **the active dehumanization of Native
peoples**]{.underline}, [**scientists** in settler colonies also
**appropriated Indigenous knowledge** of plants to treat disease and
injury as part of a broader effort to **build their disciplinary and
institutional capital**]{.underline} (Wilder, 2013). As Wilder (2013)
documents, [the status of Atlantic colleges]{.underline} in the 18th
century [was measured by **the knowledge it had amassed**,
which]{.underline} also [included **Indigenous human remains** that
provided **curricular objects of study**]{.underline} (p. 186).
[Continued desires to **expand** medical knowledge **required cadavers**
for research]{.underline} and to train future physicians. [The bodies of
**deceased enslaved Black people** were]{.underline} notoriously sought
after---even [**dug up from cemeteries**---for this
development]{.underline}. Circulars for the Medical College of South
Carolina in the early 19th century touted the quality of medical
training it could offer students through the availability of cadavers, a
testament to the school's "great opportunities for the acquisition of
anatomical knowledge" (Washington, 2006, p. 107). As Washington (2006)
points out, such claims are revealing in that surgery at the college was
"performed only on blacks---slave or free" (p. 107). Critical
methodology and science studies scholars underscore how [the **cells**,
**bodies**, and **lives** of variously **racialized peoples** continue
to be targeted as **objects of research** and
**extraction**]{.underline} (Reardon & TallBear, 2012; Tuck & Yang,
2014; Washington, 2006), [even]{.underline} [in]{.underline} biomedical
research with "**[social justice]{.underline}**" [oriented
**aims**]{.underline} (Benjamin, 2013; Nelson, 2016; TallBear, 2013).
Together, this and other critical scholarship examining the coloniality
of traditional research practices (Quijano, 2007; Tuhiwai Smith, 2012)
and of university spaces (Brophy, 2016; Chiang, 2009) deepens
predominant frameworks for engaging the ethics of research. Although the
Tuskegee syphilis experiment was an important policy tipping point, the
origin stories surrounding the IRB historically and analytically
decontextualize these violences and dangerously risk explaining away the
violence as actions of racist individuals, rather than as part of
systematic processes of racialized accumulation. What then is
accomplished through these elisions that continue to narrate Tuskegee
through a frame of eventfulness? Upholding "Colonial Unknowing": The
2018 Revisions to the Common Rule In 2011, a committee of over 60
experts convened by the National Research Council began the first of a
series of meetings to inform the federal government's efforts to revise
the Common Rule and advise how these guidelines might be better suited
to the work of researchers in the social and behavioral sciences.10 The
2014 report, which documents their final recommendations to the ANPRM,
notes that the principles of the Belmont Report can be honored while,
"keeping abreast of the universe of changes that factor into the ethical
conduct of research today" (NationalResearch Council, 2014, p. 1). While
the report aims to nuance the paternalistic and other power-laden logics
that undergird the Common Rule, ultimately, these recommendations lack
critical engagement with the ethically fraught racial--colonial
histories and ongoing conditions that continue to shape the practice of
research today.11 As in our origin stories of the IRB, [research ethics
is understood within the bounds of **specific research projects,**
making it **difficult** to speak to the **complex social and political
contexts that not only shape where researchers might engage their work,
but also the institutions that employ them and make this work
possible.**]{.underline} In their introduction to a (2016) issue of
Theory & Event, [Vimalassery, Pegues, and Goldstein develop the concept
of]{.underline} "**[colonial unknowing]{.underline}**" [to consider the
ways in which **settler colonialism**]{.underline} [is "**aggressively
made** and **reproduced**, **affectively invested** and **effectively
distributed** in ways that **conform** the social relations and
economies of **the here and now**]{.underline}" (p. 1). Borrowing from
Byrd's (2011) theorization of "colonial agnosia," **[colonial unknowing
points to the necessary and active disavowals that uphold the
persistence of settler colonialism to structure U.S. social and
political relations without registering as an occupation in the everyday
commonsense]{.underline}** (Baloy, 2016). The term is grounded in the
specificity of the ongoing political contestations of Indigenous claims
to sovereignty within settler contexts such as the United States,
Canada, Australia, and others. I evoke it here as a useful formulation
to consider the ways in which **[research ethics is
shaped]{.underline}** through the prism of the IRB **[to obscure the
ways in which knowledge production and academic institutions are
complicit in producing and upholding these relations of
power]{.underline}**, understandings of ethics, and [what
constitutes]{.underline} ethical research. **["Unknowing"]{.underline}**
[is]{.underline} theorized [**not merely** as an **omission**,
**absence**, or **gap**, but analyzed for **what such elisions
produce**]{.underline}. Thus, we might consider how the IRB and its
connected discourses of **[research ethics are sites through which the
racial--colonial entanglements of universities are actively reproduced
and erased. As such, to be challenged, they require reframings of
research ethics that are grounded in the very material effects of
knowledge production.]{.underline}** Within this framing, expanding the
categories of research exempt from IRB review supports scholars who
problematically argue that qualitative methods, such as conducting
observations, asking questions, or interpreting documents, are similar
to activities of everyday life and thus deem the potential harms of such
research as "minor and reversible emotional distress" (Dingwall, 2008,
p. 3). For example, the NAS recommends that the primary metric
concerning the use of publically available data in research should be
privacy: . . . investigator use of only publicly available information,
information in the public domain, or information that can be observed in
public contexts is not human-subjects research andthus is outside of 45
C.F.R. § 46 \[the Common Rule\], whether or not the information is
identifiable, as long as individuals whose information is obtained have
no reasonable expectation of privacy. (p. 47) In this description, risk
is understood within the framework of individual rights and "reasonable
expectation of privacy." Yet as critical scholars have long-argued, the
possible harms of social research extend far beyond immediate physical
risks within the research interaction and into the meanings that are
made from the interactions researchers observe, ask about and collect,
whether or not they violate an individual's privacy (Tuck, 2009; Tuck &
Yang, 2014; Tuhiwai Smith, 2012). [Risk must also understood through
**deeper analytical** and **historical frameworks**, such as the
possibility of **(re)producing deficit narratives** that point to
**racialized communities** as sources of **social failure**, **burden**,
and **harm**, **rather than interrogating the systems that produce these
social conditions**]{.underline} (Tuck & Yang, 2014; Valencia, 2010).
**[Narratives of racial deficit]{.underline}** [are **flexible tools**
that have been **persistently refashioned** throughout U.S. history to
**solidify the uneven distribution of life possibilities**]{.underline}
[as **natural** and **even objective**]{.underline}. The role of
scientifically produced knowledge in solidifying such narratives cannot
be ignored. For example, 19th-century public health researchers in San
Francisco characterized Chinese tenement communities as sources of
disease and contagion, resulting in policies of surveillance, isolation,
and public disinvestment in resources such as basic sanitation services
(Shah, 2011). In a more contemporary example, the DNA samples of
Havasupai indigenous community collected in the 1990s under the lead of
geneticist Therese Markow were later used for a variety of studies,
including research that threatened ancestral tribal land claims (Reardon
& TallBear, 2012; Tuck & Yang, 2014). Even in biomedical research then,
"risk" extends into the knowledge that is produced, disseminated, and
enacted from the data, rather than merely what is collected. Thus, to
expand the categories of exempt research based on metrics of individual
privacy, for example, flattens conceptions of "risk" within social
science research as minimal and everyday. Indeed, critical scholars will
not merely rely on the IRB as their rubric for research ethics. However,
given the symbolic power of the IRB as the formal institutional
mechanism for research ethics, these and other recommendations
potentially communicate that social scientific research is merely a
neutral endeavor of inquiry. Without formal institutional efforts to
address the forms of racial colonial violence produced through research
both historically and contemporarily, we cannot merely understand the
revisions to the Common Rule for their logistical impacts, but as an
extension of colonial unknowing. Toward Anti-Colonial Research Ethics At
its core, my argument is concerned with the way in which the IRB narrows
institutional framings of research ethics. **[We cannot begin with
Tuskegee and expect scholars to understand the racial--colonial
entanglements that are at the foundations of research and U.S.-based
institutions]{.underline}**. As practitioners committed to truth and
knowledge production, institutional commitments to anticolonial and
antiracist research should not be matters of theoretical orientation,
but matters of practicing better social inquiry; that is, not matters of
individual choice, but of collective action and ethical practice. Even
if and when scholars are not working with communities that have been
systematically racialized and marginalized through intersectional forms
of structural inequality, it is incumbent on researchers to understand
how our own disciplinary and institutional histories are connected to
these processes. **[This requires an understanding of and engagements
against status quo forms of "epistemological nihilation that curriculum
violence and erasure produce and maintain"]{.underline}** (King, 2017,
p. 219). I am suggesting then, that it is not merely the work of
"critical" scholars to engage in antiracist and anticolonial research
ethics. [The **task** of research ethics **demands** engagement with
traditions of scholarship that offer **counter-frameworks to settler
logics of knowledge**]{.underline} (Battiste, 2013; Kovach, 2009; Tuck,
2009; Tuhiwai Smith, 2012). Yet in the process of reframing research
ethics, [the goal is **not to merely replace** these **predominant
origin stories** with new ones that make **rhetorical acknowledgements**
to the colonial entanglements of research toward **more moral
institutional self-concepts**]{.underline}. Instead, we must work toward
active institutional commitments to shift resources and research
practices to forms of knowledge that are anticolonial. As Shotwell
(2016) elaborates, **["\[s\]ince it is not possible to avoid complicity,
we do better to start from an assumption that everyone is implicated in
situations we]{.underline}** (at least in some way)
**[repudiate]{.underline}**" (p. 5). [Rather than imagining **research
as an antidote**]{.underline} or antithetical [to contemporary
conditions of **injustices**, we are **better** **positioned** to engage
these contexts of injustice as **central to our engagement of research
ethics.**]{.underline} In this spirit, **[understanding the complicity
of academic research and institutions is a "starting point for
action"]{.underline}** (Shotwell, 2016, p. 5). Articulating a more
robust periodization of research ethics does not necessitate that we
undermine knowledge production or academic contexts as inherently
problematic, even though there is much to be done to reimagine and
recreate our institutions through anticolonial and antiracist practices
(Ahmed, 2012; Harney & Moten, 2013). [It provides **an important
opening**]{.underline} for both individual researchers and importantly,
for institutions, to take seriously what research ethics might mean in
terms of real, material resources and formsof anticolonial
"answerability" toward its communities and contexts [in ways that **move
against academic research as a site of accumulation and
extraction**]{.underline} (Patel, 2016).

### L - Anti-Capitalism 

**The affirmative simply understands the native as another wage worker,
but neglects the ontological register of Indianness that exists outside
the metaphysical plane of labor**

**Baker, PhD Candidate in English, 17**

(Oliver, Research focuses on the intersecting histories of settler
colonialism, racial capitalism, white supremacy, and class in American
literature and culture. In particular, his dissertation examines how the
early literary fictions of Native, Mexican, and African American writers
from 1848-1940 represent economic dispossession from the other side of
colonial difference, June 2017, "Democracy, Class, and White Settler
Colonialism", *Public Journal*, Volume 28, Number 55, pp. 144-53, jwm)

Indigenous Dispossession, Indigeneity, and Indianness [One of the
principal insights of settler colonial studies and Indigenous critical
theory is to conceptualize the dispossession of Indigenous peoples as an
ongoing structural violence constitutive of capitalist accumulation and
the liberal state form]{.underline}. As Patrick Wolfe emphasizes,
settler colonialism is understood as a "structure rather than an event"
that dispossess the lands, resources, and bodies of Indigenous peoples.6
Unlike franchise colonialism, in which colonized populations are
exploited for their labour or are positioned in an interdependent
economic relationship of uneven development, [settler colonialism
dispossesses Indigenous peoples through genocide and
erasure]{.underline}. Put simply, the settler colonies of North America
are premised on eliminating Indigenous peoples. That Indigenous peoples
exist today is not because settler societies decided to include them; it
is because [Indigenous peoples have resisted and survived despite the
best efforts of settler colonialism to destroy and decimate
them]{.underline}. In recent years, [settler state policies have shifted
away from a strategy of direct violence and forced
assimilation]{.underline}---mostly in response to the political threat
posed by the anticolonial nationalisms of the mid-twentieth
century---and [toward what Glen Coulthard describes as a politics of
"colonial recognition," in which settler societies promise greater
accommodation and recognition of Indigenous groups but only to the
extent that claims of sovereignty or demands for decolonization go
unheard and remain disavowed]{.underline}.7 A politics of colonial
recognition also calls for reconciliation and healing between settlers
and Indigenous peoples as a way to mend what is believed to be a racial
or cultural conflict rather than a struggle over land and sovereignty.
While settler societies might affirm the diversity of Indigenous
cultures or even lament past incidents of colonial violence,
centuries-old structures and institutions of dispossession remain in
place. These can be witnessed today in [the underdevelopment of tribal
economies that encourages the privatization of (or the attempt to
dissolve) tribally-held land and resources; neoliberal policies that
slash public services and deregulate predatory credit and loan
industries]{.underline}, while funding entrepreneurial "[self-help"
initiatives in Indian country; the use of state and police violence to
brutalize, incarcerate, and murder unsheltered and working poor
Indigenous peoples whose presence "off the reservation" in border towns
is seen as a threat and danger to the property and flows of capital of
settler society]{.underline}; [extraction]{.underline} industries
[that]{.underline} destructively [seek to unearth and/or transport
fossil fuels on or through tribal lands]{.underline}; **[and the ongoing
refusal of federal governments to honour the treaties, land claims, and
rights to self-determination of the Indigenous nations]{.underline}** of
North America. A second key analytic of settler colonial studies and
Indigenous critical theory is the concept of Indigeneity. Although
defined in various ways, for this essay's purposes Indigeneity can be
described as the social category of persons whose ways of life, forms of
knowing, and modes of being depend upon originary relationships to land
bases that Euro-American settlers have enclosed and continue to occupy.
[Because Indigenous peoples claim originary ties to these land bases,
their presence or attempt to live on and through them challenges the
legitimacy of settler society]{.underline}. As a social category
constituted through elimination and genocide[, Indigeneity should be
understood as distinct from, for example, the category of the wage
labourer that is structured by proletarianization and
hegemony]{.underline}. If [wage labourers]{.underline}, whether employed
or unemployed, [are structurally included in the marketplace where their
labour power is exploited]{.underline}, **[the marketplace itself and
the liberal state]{.underline}** form **[that upholds it
are]{.underline}** nonetheless **[premised on the elimination of
Indigenous peoples altogether]{.underline}**. The ideological framework
that mediates, legitimates, and reproduces Indigenous dispossession and
its category of Indigeneity is the colonial and racial grammar of what
Jodi Byrd calls "Indianness."8 The **[Indian came to be a social
ontology in which Indigenous peoples were understood as savage, ancient,
living fossils of early humanity, stuck outside of time and space in a
state of nature]{.underline}**. The Indian was and continues to be both
abjected and romanticized in settler culture as a person who exists in a
state of natural warfare, instability, and conflict, while also
appearing liberated from the constraints and alienation of modern life.
In this state of nature, [the Indian is understood to lack the capacity
to labour productively, possess property, or enter into social
contracts.]{.underline} Through such meanings, [the Indian emerges as
the outside]{.underline} or Other [to Euro-American forms of liberal
democracy, selfhood, and civil society]{.underline}.9 As Byrd
emphasizes, "European modernity hinges upon Indians as the necessary
antinomy through which the New World---along with civilization, freedom,
sovereignty, and humanity---comes to have meaning, structure, and
presence." 10 The Indian, in short, became the figure of the
un-sovereign through which it was understood that the Indian might
occupy but could never possess the ability or right to own lands or
possess selfhood.11 [The dispossession of Indigenous lands, resources,
and bodies thus came to be seen less as a form of theft than the natural
transition from "savage" communalism to civilized market
society.]{.underline} Today, Indianness continues, as Byrd puts it, to
"transit U.S. empire," or put into motion, facilitate, and cohere the
United States\' settler imperial project that reaches around the
world.12 It is [through Indianness that settlers come to view the lands,
resources, and bodies of the earth as spaces and objects of a barren
wilderness (terra nullius) freely available for
expropriation.]{.underline} The current and future populations living in
spaces of the lands and controlling the resources that US settler
imperialism attempts to seize or control are, as Byrd explains, made
"[Indian" or abjected as mindless terrorist-savages whose confrontation
with the agents of enclosure is understood not as an attempt to resist
and survive colonization, occupation, and genocide, but an irrational
attack against society, civilization, humanity, and the forces of modern
progress]{.underline}. In short, **[Indianness is what legitimates the
process of primitive accumulation or what David Harvey calls
\"accumulation by dispossession,\" which is central to the formation,
expansion, and dominance of global finance capitalism.]{.underline}**13
What an understanding, then, of [settler colonialism, Indigeneity, and
Indianness demonstrates concerning the question of alliance-building
among oppressed groups]{.underline} today is that [political organizing
through the spaces of the democratic commons or the identity of the
settler wage labourer supports rather than disrupts the colonization of
Indigenous peoples of North America]{.underline}. In the case of the
democratic commons, [calls for preserving and expanding the public
institutions and spaces of liberal democracy in order to cultivate more
radical and progressive forms of democracy is a demand]{.underline} not
to undo or transform but [to uphold the settler colonial
state]{.underline}. As Byrd argues, "one reason why a 'post racial' and
just democratic society is a lost cause in the United States is that it
is always already conceived through the prior disavowed and
misremembered colonization of Indigenous lands that cannot be ended by
further inclusion or more participation."14 Coulthard echoes this point,
showing that "in liberal settler states...the 'commons' not only belong
to somebody...they also deeply inform and sustain Indigenous modes of
thought and behavior."15 While it should be acknowledged that the
[democratic commons]{.underline} historically has served an important
role in cultivating and producing emancipatory modes of analysis and
forms of social belonging, such gains have nonetheless [always depended
upon the colonization of Indigenous peoples. Any defence, then, of the
democratic commons today must at the same time defend Indigenous
sovereignty]{.underline}. This means rethinking how groups relate in the
spaces of the commons in ways that do not perpetuate liberal
democracy\'s colonial project of building public institutions and
democratic spaces through the seizure, theft, and colonization of
Indigenous lands, bodies, and resources. **[Class-first models of a
renewed workers' movement also risk reproducing colonial dispossession
when they fail to recognize that the Indian and the settler wage
labourer are structurally distinct categories of
oppression.]{.underline}** [The former is constituted by dispossession
through elimination, while the latter is structured by exploitation
through hegemony.]{.underline} Even though exploited, [settler wage
labourers nonetheless come to experience their status in settler
colonialism as a place of refuge and protection from dispossession and
abjection]{.underline}. The role of [the settler state is to ensure and
safeguard the settler wage labourer's right not only to possess but not
to be dispossessed of property, even if the only property the wage
labourer possesses is labour power]{.underline}. In fact, [possessing
labour power as a commodity to sell on the market indexes the settler
wage labourer's right and ability to enter the social contract and find
security from the forms of structural exclusion naturalized in the
position of the Indian]{.underline}. Such a status explains why, when
neoliberal forms of precarious labour and exclusions from waged life
increasingly target settler wage labourers, they are felt and
represented as abnormal, undeserving, and, more importantly, grievable
occurrences. [The dispossession of settlers challenges the symbolic and
material consistency of settler societies that are premised on
dispossessing colonial peoples in order to reward and advantage settlers
of all classe]{.underline}s. Settler [society retains and reproduces its
coherence as the promised site of settler sovereignty, possession, and
rights by figuring the neoliberal dispossession of settlers as the
exception to be overcome if]{.underline} only [because]{.underline}
**[Indigenous dispossession remains the norm to be reproduced and
repeated.]{.underline}** The grievability of neoliberal dispossession,
heard today in the refrain that globalization has "abandoned the white
working class," depends upon the ungrievability and normalization of
Indigenous dispossession that, in the narratives not only of manifest
destiny but also the democratic commons and normative socialist futures,
is depicted and accepted as a natural, inevitable, and necessary
process. One of the limits, then, of calling for solidarity through the
political identity of the wage labourer is that, [in settler
colonialism, what organized settler wage labourers demand is not
necessarily an end to exploitation but the freedom, protection, and
refuge from structural dispossession and exclusion that are normalized
and naturalized in the social and racial ontologies of the
Indian]{.underline}. **[Movements on behalf of settler labourers risk
ending in reform rather than revolution precisely because they do not so
much seek to confront capital as they seek refuge and protection within
and through it.]{.underline}**

### L -- Apocalyptic rhetoric

#### Apocalyptic depictions of the end are a settlers move to innocence that naturalize the settler commons through politics to protect the settlement

In the United States what constitutes "public lands" has never been
stable. Notions of the public and their commons were a fickle matter of
political contest and power relations before the beginning of what is
currently called America. [Today, who and what serve to underwrite,
define, and profit from "public lands" is a debate often expressed in
cataclysmic language.]{.underline} Militarized government officials and
extrastate militias extend across our shared social, political, and
physical landscapes, as our terrains seem to scar, wither, blister, and
combust in ways even our most apocalyptic and dystopic imaginations
struggle to comprehend. [Can we protect a piece of this world for all of
us? Can we fight for the land that we live in and love? How do we
survive the end of the world that seems so fast approaching? Who are the
"we" in these questions?]{.underline} The issues that immediately arise
in discussions of the commons--- namely whose commons and for what
purposes--- often still assume a public that is, in fact, particular to
white settler subjects. As a settler scholar raised by uninvited
hippies, loggers, and mill workers on Kalapuyailihi (Kalapuya
homelands), I frequently find myself implicit in the publics
universalized in, and made invisible by, current debates over public
lands. From my vantage point in the middle of this ["we" supposedly
anticipating or already suffering the beginning of the end of the world
of public lands, it is difficult to decipher the apocalyptic language
commoning settler colonial capitalism]{.underline}, making it, as it
were, so ordinary as to be almost imperceptible. Almost. Th is article
takes two examples of contempor[ary debates over public lands as
paradigmatic case studies for the ways **apocalyptic**]{.underline} 50
Western American Literature vol. 54, no. 1 spring 2019 **[appeals
populate and naturalize the "settler commons" across the spectrum of US
politics]{.underline}** (Fortier). Through the comparison it finds a
convergence in what are often seen as irreconcilable differences between
leftist environmentalisms and libertarian land- use logics.
[**Apocalyptic depictions** of the coming or in- progress collapse of
the commons **naturalize a space** that both white environmentalists and
**white nationalists share.**]{.underline} It then turns to apocalyptic
imaginations of public space beyond the settler commons, concluding in a
tentative example of the commons as indeed not static, not settled, but
as an invitation to ongoing practice- based relationships of
responsibility that require some of us--- like me--- to learn in public.
Public lands, I find, are the spaces in which we are held accountable to
very particular publics. In the patois of pithy prose, public land is a
verb. First, in December of 2017 the Trump administration announced its
decision to shrink Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-- Escalante National
Monuments in Utah. In response the outdoor equipment retailer Patagonia
took out a full- page ad in the New York Times, which they emailed to
all their customers and used to fill their website's main page. The ad
was simple: a stark black background occupied with the striking white
words, "The President Stole Your Land." This alert was underwritten with
a byline describing the "illegal" reduction as "the largest elimination
of protected land in American history." This minimalist ad showcases a
mode of commoning common to, but often obscured in, the supposedly
irreconcilable political divide characterizing debates around US public
lands. In its brief text lurk the language of federal overreach, land
theft, breach of constitutional rights, and the tyranny of the federal
government that is not just reminiscent of but exactly the same rhetoric
touted by many sectors of white nationalism. Here is, in all its
simplicity, an idea of public lands shared by much mainstream
environmentalism as well as states- rights proponents such as those
supporting Cliven Bundy's 2014 Nevada standoff and the 2016 occupation
of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge led by Cliven's sons, Ammon and
Ryan. At Malheur, Ammon Bundy echoed his father to emphasize the duty to
protect "the people" from a tyrannical government bent on stealing
land.1 Much of the protest of the Malheur occupation parroted the same
language to decry the theft April Anson 51 of public lands. We have a
duty to protect "our land," say the conservationists and white
nationalists, "this land is ours." Yet, [when actual federal overreach
does occur, as we saw in Standing Rock and continue to see any place
where Native nations' sovereignty is ignored, the US legal system almost
always favors the economies of the settler state]{.underline}, whether
those be recreation or resource extraction. This undeniable inequality
was laid bare on October 27, 2016, when seven members of the armed
takeover of Malheur were acquitted on the very same day that 141 unarmed
water protectors were arrested at Standing Rock. Though media outlets
and individuals expressed anger over such blatant disparity, Native
American literary scholar Kirby Brown emphasized their predictability
because they are "structured into the legal and political fabric of
dispossession, genocide, slavery, segregation, racism and labor
exploitation through which the United States as we know it came to exist
and continues to operate." The common ground of the United States, Brown
reminds us, is made and remade through settler violence. Such
discrepancies, then, should be easy to foretell. However, our
imaginations are continually constrained by tales that tie together the
legal and political fabric that Brown describes. These stories settle
the settler commons, fencing us in to the settler space densely defended
in the Patagonia ad. Some of what simultaneously protects and erases
this Fig. 1. Screenshot of Patagonia website homepage, 4 Dec. 2017. 52
Western American Literature vol. 54, no. 1 spring 2019 commoning are the
apocalyptic appeals of the ad. Its black and white aesthetic arrests
audience attention, while its assertion that the federal government is
stealing "your" land recruits the audience into what la paperson calls a
settler environmentalist project. For la paperson, settler
environmentalism works through terra sacer--- regarding lands as both
"sacred and accursed," in need of rescue and "preserve-able" ("Ghetto
Land Pedagogy" 116-- 17). Terra sacer reinforces the settler as
environmental steward, the person able to decide who or what is
deserving of protection (117). Instead of affirming the actual
sacredness of those lands to the Indigenous peoples who fought for their
protection in the first place, and whose relationships to them precedes
by millennia the so- called conservation movement, Patagonia's ad
consecrates a settler commons by implicitly asking "us" to imagine this
land grab as an initial moment that threatens our own yards with
overreach of federal authority.2 The ad [operates akin to a state of
emergency, a condition most closely associated with stories of
apocalypse.]{.underline} Its crisis both compels and constricts our
imaginations of the commons to a settler space under threat, placing us
in the very center of this threatened commons as victims of ongoing
colonization. The ad [thus transfigures the audience into a position of
indigeneity, equating the audience with peoples who actually experience
the theft of their lands, past and ongoing, while simultaneously
securing "settler innocence" by protecting structures of
power]{.underline} (Tuck and Yang 10). The ad thus arrests more than our
attention. It limits our ability to get beyond the dystopic social
relations of the settler state. [This type of apocalypticism is endemic
to settler colonial capitalism.]{.underline} The appeals shore up the
logics of settler accumulation, reinforcing a scarcity model of the
commons repopularized in 1968 by Garrett Hardin in a piece that took the
assumed predictability of "human" selfishness and resource overuse as
premises for privatization. Arguing against what he saw as the
inevitable "tragedy of the commons," Hardin limited his engagement with
the concept to a romanticized Euro- centric intellectual tradition that
neglects the exclusive nature of most commons known to that very same
history. Instead, he offered a neoliberal apologia that updated social
Darwinism for an audience made anxious by the political revolt marking
that period.3 Like Hardin's tragic commons, Patagonia's ad plays on the
threats of loss to erase structures of power. The ad's state- of-
emergency- like visual drama and textual appeals communicate a
catastrophic event that whitewashes the bloody truth that [North
American history is written through the continuous theft of Indigenous
lands, elimination through violence, broken treaties, and, often, **in
the name of "protection."**]{.underline} The ad's dependence on the
apocalyptic is amnesia making.

### L - Arms 

#### Arms sales are not neutral -- a history of genocide, dispossession, dominance over nature and intra communal violence caused by Settlers usage and proliferation of arms proves that the arms management techniques of the affirmative just becomes another attempt to absolve itself from its violent past.

gender studies; July 25, 2018; "How Settler Colonialism Influenced the
Gun Debate",
<https://intpolicydigest.org/2018/07/25/how-settler-colonialism-influenced-the-gun-debate/>)

Laws are not our problem. Rather, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold are the
latest byproducts of America's infatuation with firearms. [The source of
this violent epidemic does not stem from private sale loopholes; not
even the military-industrial complex]{.underline}. We [need to look
deeper, and explore the ways]{.underline} in which our [country was
founded on a mountain of bullets]{.underline}. On nearly [every vessel
that set sail for the Americas]{.underline} after Christopher Columbus'
initial voyage to Hispaniola, many [sailors]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [conquerors]{.underline} [carried a firearm
alongside]{.underline}. Facing a New World meant new challenges for
these colonizers; [here]{.underline}, we saw [the earliest iteration of
gun violence]{.underline} [as]{.underline} the [means]{.underline} [to
safeguard the self from the other.]{.underline} To the grave, they took
guns with them. As historians unearth and analyze shipwrecks from the
colonial era, we found matchlocks --- a classic --- juxtaposed with what
remains of their owners. While these historians recount the facts of the
matter and immortalize the histories and legacies of these colonizers
postmortem, the significance of these guns on the power dynamics bred
within the fabric of the colonial Americas must be recounted as well.
The matchlock --- Europe's most advanced firearms technology at the
time --- was pivotal to the practicality of hand cannons. Whereas users
previously had to manually light gunpowder, matchlocks implemented a
lever system that dropped matches into the flash pan and cleared the
remains afterwards. This was progress for Columbus and many of those who
followed his initiative, and what better testing grounds to demonstrate
the matchlock's efficacy than the New World? Much like how armed
teachers and school resource officers would serve as deterrents against
any credible threat, [conquerors]{.underline} among Columbus [used
firearms to drive fear within the Indigenous populations]{.underline}
they encountered. A demonstration requiring nothing more than one pull
of the trigger was enough to showcase classical European ballistics. [As
the colonial era progressed]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[colonizers]{.underline} found themselves [want]{.underline}ing [more
from the Indigenous folk]{.underline} of the Americas, they saw no
better option than to change strategy. Whereas Columbus manipulated and
assimilated Indigenous populations, [the firearms-bearing
colonizers]{.underline} that set foot upon the Americas
[opted]{.underline} [for]{.underline} a new method:
[coercion]{.underline}. It's no surprise that anthropology points to
several remains riddled with pellets, with conclusive evidence showing
the origins of such bodies being colored and murdered at the start of
the colonial era. For the colonizers, [the "uncivilized" Indigenous
bodies and the "profitable" American soil beneath their feet meant an
"all means necessary" approach]{.underline} towards enriching the
motherland. And so, [colonies were built upon pellet-ridden
bodies]{.underline}. Here, [the pre-United States
demonstrated]{.underline} its **[willingness to build and sustain empire
on a mountain of bullets covering a bedrock of Indigenous blood, setting
a precedent for future leaders to draw upon as their positions put the
mercy of colored folks worldwide at their feet.]{.underline}** From the
very beginning[ --- before America even became
America]{.underline} --- [gun violence became essential, and thus,
cultural to the orderings of colonial society.]{.underline} After
invoking the furies of civilizations around America as a result of
relentless massacre, one would assume that a well-regulated militia
would be a good idea. As Indigenous folks retaliated against the
colonial settlements that stole their land and murdered their brethren,
guns proved useful in the case of self-defense, not just for the self
but for the whole. Here, [two narratives were established that would be
crucial to the maintenance of modern gun]{.underline}
[freedoms]{.underline}. First, the [usage of guns as
self-defense]{.underline} [naturalizes]{.underline} gun [violence as a
solution to societal problems]{.underline}, eventually [becoming an
exploitable naturalization in which millions]{.underline} upon millions
[in]{.underline} [revenue would be generated for today']{.underline}s
gun [manufacturers]{.underline}. [Second]{.underline}, the [usage of
guns as national security naturalizes gun violence as a means of
securitization,]{.underline} eventually [leading to a militarized law
enforcement apparatus]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the [world's
largest defense budget that actively institutes war within communities
of color both domestically and abroad.]{.underline} These colonial
societies cherished guns so much to the point where they were passed
from white settlers over to Indigenous folk. Whereas standardized
history courses would teach you that this exchange seemed unconditional
and germane to the progression of the colonial era, true history
revealed the destabilizing effect of such exchange. [Arms races pitted
Indigenous civilizations against one another]{.underline}, a precursor
to the war zones created in urban communities as a result of informal
sponsorships among major firearms manufacturers. Here, gun [violence is
no longer white-over-Indigenous]{.underline}, but [a new relation of
Indigenous-over-Indigenous that absolved white folks of the blame and
work involved in genocide]{.underline}. Much like
[Indigenous-on-Indigenous gun violence]{.underline}, [black-on-black gun
violence]{.underline} has been largely out of the discussion. Liberals
assert that the latter is a problematic frame of analysis on gun
violence, yet the truth is that such relationships of violence do occur.
Where [the truth emerges is in how white settlers --- now firearms
manufacturers, law enforcement, and military service --- have played a
necessary role in structuring that relationship.]{.underline} And so, [a
crucial part of America's settler colonial history in gun violence is
papered over as historians, history teachers, and history students
confidently infer and affirm the incivility of the Indigenous when they
witness divide-and-conquer moments]{.underline} in their research,
lesson plans, and textbooks. Here, "guns don't kill people, people kill
people" becomes not just profitable, but necessary to the collective
erasure of society's memory as we focus on the skin of those doing the
killing, rather than those who provided the means. Not only did
[colonizers]{.underline} [lead war against]{.underline} Indigenous
civilizations in their manifest destiny, but also a war on [American
ecosystems]{.underline}. With the usage of [**firearms**, the vast
populations of bison across the Plains dwindled to near extinction as
man once again **asserted its dominance over nature.**]{.underline} Many
local [Indigenous folk relied on buffalo to survive]{.underline} and
[found nothing but famine within the devastation of the
Plains]{.underline}; here, gun violence enacted immediate death upon one
population and slow genocide upon another. Resting atop a mountain of
bison skulls, America-before-America demonstrated its willingness to
upset the balance of other ecosystems --- and political landscapes, if
we're using more modern contexts --- for self-gain. Richard [Nixon
enacted slow genocide through a war on drugs, which further criminalized
people of color]{.underline} and infiltrated their communities in the
name of "public safety." Decades later, George W. [Bush took slow
genocide abroad by destabilizing the Middle East with military force in
his righteous search for "terrorists."]{.underline} Finally, the [desire
for the colonies to break away from the motherland]{.underline} and
assert their own sovereignty [sought out another usage]{.underline} of
guns: [violent]{.underline} [revolution]{.underline}. Whereas the
[Indigenous were murdered and ridiculed for doing the same against
foreign threats on the colonies]{.underline}, America internalized the
spirit of rebellion and fought a war that led to their triumph and
secession. Here, America reveals a devastating fundamental
contradiction. The [militancy among radical self-governing whites became
intrinsic to what it meant to be American]{.underline}, [yet the taking
up of arms among communities of color --- notably the Black
Panthers --- against their racist government invoked]{.underline} such a
[fear]{.underline} as to create bipartisan support for gun control
legislation. We can comfortably assume that the Second Amendment was
never about liberty, but rather a conduit for violence against colored
peoples that instantly becomes null for black radicals. With a colonial
history of gun violence in mind --- [Indigenous genocide, self-defense
against other, colonial/national security, arms races, interventionism,
and revolution ]{.underline}--- it's easy to see why the Founding
Fathers of the Constitution enlisted the most powerful legal tool in our
country to safeguard the usage of firearms for the unforeseeable future.
In the creation and maintenance of the colonies and the destruction and
neglect of the Indigenous, [gun violence became a foundational value
that was necessary to the production of America.]{.underline} [Without
guns, genocide would've been reduced]{.underline}, [Native Americans
would fight back and triumph over colonies, intertribal relations would
not be disturbed]{.underline} by divisive smuggling practices,
[and]{.underline} the [balance of the buffalo would remain]{.underline}
in place. **[Guns have held an intergenerational effect in asserting its
efficacy in the building of a nation]{.underline}**. By the time the
United States Bill of Rights came into effect, the importance of guns
had just peaked with the American Revolution. If guns were such a useful
implement to secure the freedoms that colonizers enjoyed at the
Constitutional Convention, creating an amendment was the only way to
ensure America's longevity. **[These are the values that reach, inform,
and structure our modern-day society today. As the resuscitated forces
of capitalism go hand-in-hand with the firearms manufacturers feasting
on the blood of mass and everyday shooting victims]{.underline}**,
**[America]{.underline}** has continued to not only refuse to bat an eye
at gun violence, but **[maintain complicity with the very structures
that make it]{.underline}** **[so]{.underline}**.

### L -- Arms Control

#### Regulations on arms sales are tools by imperialist nations to control colonized peoples and prevent them from acting against their interests -- the link's empirically proven.

Daniel **Stahl**, 20**19** \[History of Global Arms Transfer, "The
Decolonization of the Arms Trade: Britain and the Regulation of Exports
to the Middle East"\] \[DS\]
\[http://www.kisc.meiji.ac.jp/\~transfer/paper/pdf/07/01_Stahl.pdf\]

[Comparing]{.underline} the [interwar- and postwar-period attempts to
regulate]{.underline} the [arms trade in the Middle East, the absence of
an international law approach after 1945 is remarkable]{.underline}. In
contrast, [after World War I, the desire to regulate the influx of arms
into the region had a global impact. It acted as a strong impulse to
negotiate international law and led to both the inclusion of an arms
traffic clause in the Covenant of the League of Nations and to the
signing of the Convention of Saint-Germain]{.underline}. That said,
there is one noteworthy similarity between how the problem of limiting
the arms trade was handled before and after 1945. In both periods, [the
practice of arms transfer control was not regulated by international law
but rather by informal multilateral agreements concluded by
arms-producing states: The agreement to comply with the provisions of
the Convention of Saint-Germain regarding the prohibited zones and the
Tripartite Declaration agreement. However, the latter was not as
restrictive as the former. The agreement for the interwar period
consisted of clearly defined provisions regarding the prohibited zones
and was used by Britain to demand full compliance. Any arms transfer not
consistent with the provisions was denounced. The Tripartite
Declaration, on the other hand, formulated only vague, general
guidelines. None of the signatories made an attempt to enforce full
compliance. **One explanation for these differences can be found in the
process of decolonization after 1945. It is no coincidence that the most
comprehensive negotiations for limiting the arms trade through
international law and the implementation of the most effective measures
to limit the transfer of arms took place during the interwar period,
when the colonial empires reached their maximum extent. In order to
control these vast territories, the colonial powers were willing to
strengthen international law and negotiate effective
agreements.**]{.underline} [Once they began to lose their hold on
territories in South Asia and the Middle East, however, they also began
to lose interest in regulating the arms trade through international law.
Decolonization not only brought down arms transfer regulations; it also
transformed the effects of arms trade regulations]{.underline}. The
interests of the former colonial powers in the Middle East had not
disappeared, as this region provided a considerable share of the
increasing demand for oil. However, vis-a-vis sovereign states, the
means of exerting influence had to change. [Anti-colonialism, Arab
nationalism, the Cold War and the Arab--Israeli conflict put the ability
of the Western powers to secure their interests in the region to the
test. This constellation of factors transformed the Middle Eastern arms
market from the ground up. During the interwar period, the significance
of the region for the global arms market lay in its function as a
transfer site for mainly small weapons. From here, arms coming from
Europe were re-routed to South Asia, where Britain's main interests lay.
As the former colonial powers and new superpowers tried to secure a
certain degree of control over the Middle East in the two decades
following World War II, the Middle Eastern states became recipients of
highly sophisticated weapons.]{.underline} Because of their
sophistication, [these weapons created new dependencies, which the
former colonial powers hoped to exploit to influence the policies of
decolonized states]{.underline}. Arms trade regulations, on the
contrary, were increasingly regarded as a hindrance to exerting
influence. Finally, [decolonization created a new and substantial arms
market for sophisticated weapons, one which was large enough to have an
impact on the national economy of the former colonial powers. It was not
just that the emergence of new states created new customers. Attempts by
the Middle Eastern states to emancipate themselves from the influence of
former colonial powers, together with the desire of hegemonic powers to
maintain or gain influence, had created by the mid-1950s a dynamic which
led to a boom in the Middle Eastern arms market. Hence, the economic
cost of arms trade regulations grew remarkably.]{.underline} As the
example of Britain shows, it would be too simplistic to state that
Whitehall was eager to secure a profitable market for its armament
industry. Because of its volume, the Middle Eastern arms market had
effects on different political issues: defence spending, trade and
currency policies. Therefore, British authorities had little interest in
arms trade regulations. From a contemporary viewpoint, **[the
restriction of the arms trade as an instrument to pursue imperial goals
might seem like a paradox. Arms trade regulations are widely interpreted
as a sign of humanitarization of international law, while colonialism is
rightly regarded as a system of repression that caused great harm to
humankind. Nonetheless, it was colonialism which created a singular
window of opportunity to restrict the arms trade during the interwar
period, whereas the process of decolonization contributed significantly
to closing this window.]{.underline}**

#### **Imperial metropoles controlling the flow of arms is a broader attempt to control populations and assemblage of norms. Humanitarian arm control follows patterns of colonialism to hide more radical agendas.** 

**Cooper 18-**Neil Cooper is the head of peace studies and international
development at the University of Bradford. (Oct. 2018, "Race,
Sovereignty, and Free Trade: Arms Trade Regulation and Humanitarian Arms
Control in the Age of Empire"
https://academic.oup.com/jogss/article-abstract/3/4/444/5076385?redirectedFrom=PDF
//RC)

Thus, rather than being an era of free trade as often claimed, the
[period was characterized by a dual regime of regulation: the
application of a liberal export norm for peacetime arms exports *from*
imperial metropoles combined with extensive attempts to manage arms
flows *into, within, and between* colonial spaces]{.underline}. Finally,
[these broader attempts at prohibition were part of a much larger
temporally-bound assemblage of norms, laws, and logics that constituted
the practices of arms control as governmentality]{.underline}---the
third matryoshka doll of arms trade governance. [**Arms control as
governmentality** denotes a context where **mechanisms of** proscription
*and* **permission operate as technologies of social control designed to
manage which populations can legitimately use what kinds of
weapons**.]{.underline} Overall, I demonstrate how an understanding of
[arms regulation in the late nineteenth century undermines the
claims]{.underline} of norm optimists [that HAC (humanitarian arms
control) is inherently transformational and progressive in its promotion
of good norms and a benign logic of human security]{.underline}.
Instead, **[HAC in the late nineteenth century was consistent with
colonialism, racism, and militarism.]{.underline}** This is not to
discount the notion that there are important differences between
contemporary HAC and its late nineteenth-century variant. Rather, it is
to [highlight the need for a more thoroughgoing and historicized
genealogy of HAC and a recognition of the "limits of possibility"
inherent in the pursuit of tactical humanitarian "disarmament" without
strategic demilitarization.]{.underline} The arms trade norms debate is
characterized by a division between optimists and pessimists.
Interestingly, optimists include those who claim the mantle of
constructivism (Wizotski 2009; Garcia 2015) or critical international
relations/security studies (Borrie 2014) just as much as the pessimists
do. The [optimistic school argues]{.underline} the post-Cold War era has
witnessed [the *novel* introduction of inherently benevolent
humanitarian or human security norms into the regulation of the arms
trade]{.underline} (Axworthy 2001, 20, 23; Centre for Humanitarian
Dialogue 2003; Borrie 2006; Kyto ̋ mäki 2015, 2, 4). [This]{.underline},
it is argued, has [resulted in the creation of new prohibitory arms
trade norms that imply either a more restrictive approach to arms
exports or, at the very least, a more restrictive approach to
"irresponsible" arms exports.]{.underline} For example, the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has noted of the UN ATT
that "states have *never before* signed an international treaty that
aimed to regulate the arms trade, [with the **express purpose of
reducing human suffering**]{.underline}" (ICRC 2013, emphasis added). As
will be demonstrated below, [**such claims are just historically
wrong.**]{.underline} Although far more sophisticated in her analyses,
Garcia (2015, 7) has not only argued initiatives on small [arms can be
understood as part of a series of "novel" humanitarian security regimes
but also that these are different from traditional arms control
instruments that "took a purely regulatory approach."]{.underline} In
contrast, these [new humanitarian security regimes have established new
international norms driven by altruistic imperatives, are "about
everyone's security," and have "restructured" conceptions of national
interest]{.underline} (ibid., 61). In this view, post-Cold War
"norm-mongers" have not just circumscribed the "warmongers" but [have
established new constitutive norms with far-reaching effects on
international actors' understanding of their identities and
interests]{.underline}. Others acknowledge that [humanitarian campaigns
extract specific initiatives on individual weapons from the broader
complex of war and militarism but suggest this is a **strategic
campaigning device that can hide more radical agendas**]{.underline}
(Bolton and Minor 2016). In this variant of optimism, action on small
arms can be understood as part of an [incrementalism, "one technology at
a time" route to disarmament and antimilitarism]{.underline}
(Stavrianakis 2016, 844). The [reconstruction of identities and
interests]{.underline} is, therefore, just around the corner. Such
optimistic assessments have led to a small but burgeoning literature on
the phenomenon of post-Cold War HAC or "humanitarian disarmament." This
label not only covers action on small arms but also initiatives on
landmines, cluster munitions, and even recent humanitarian initiatives
to ban nuclear weapons (Thakur and Maley 1999; Borrie and Randin 2006;
Wizotski 2009, 2013, 3; Borrie 2014, 626; Ritchie 2014; Bolton and Minor
2016; Minor 2015). Historicizing the drivers and outcomes of early
examples of HAC, therefore, has implications for our understanding of
the transformative potential inherent in present-day HAC/ humanitarian
disarmament initiatives.

#### **Arms reductions policy is optimist liberalism that legitimatizes a monopoly over violence that the state exercises and has cynical violence patterns invested within itself.**

**Stravrianakis '11---** Anna Stravrianakis is a Senior lecturer in
international relations and director of teaching and learning Global
Studies. (5/24/11, "Small Arms Control and the Reproduction of Imperial
Relations",
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13523260.2011.556861 //RC)

The [**expansion of** the security-development agenda stems from a
**progressive impulse to ameliorate human suffering**, but the
**assumptions on which it is based are problematic.**]{.underline}
Taking seriously the argument that violence and war 'should not . . . be
seen as oddities, distortions or distractions but should be regarded as
closely connected to progress and development'88 poses a serious
challenge to this policy impulse. However, unlike Duffield's argument,
this one, by Christopher Cramer, has not been taken up in the policy
world. The assumption that violent conflict is 'development in reverse'
-- prevalent in policy circles, including those dealing with small
arms89 -- is, according to Cramer, 'an attitude without historical
memory' that 'borders on the sentimental' as conflict, including violent
conflict, is intrinsic to development. That is, while destructive,
violent conflict may have the potential to contribute to progressive
long-term change.90 This is a seriously difficult idea to work into
policy circles, especially those concerned with human security. [The
assumption that war is development in reverse has its corollary in the
argument that progress must occur without violence]{.underline}91 --
[through democracy, good governance, economic growth, institutions, and
so on.]{.underline} But the [idea that violence can be overcome by
introducin]{.underline}g free markets and [democratic institutions is
'dangerously mistaken']{.underline}, according to Cramer.92 In the
former Yugoslavia, for example, democratization and security sector
reform have combined to undermine security for the majority of the
population.93 More widely, conventional [understandings of violence are
based on the 'common and powerful **idea that liberal modernity has
outgrown aggressive violence**', which **results in violence** being
**understood as a distortion of normality**, or as pathology/disorder,
**caused by** the insufficient entrenchment of **liberal capitalist
modernity.**]{.underline}94 As a result, '[liberalism disowns all forms
of violence]{.underline} beyond individual self-defence [or the
**legitimate monopoly of violence that the liberal-democratic state
exercises'**.95]{.underline} This is [what we see happening]{.underline}
in the debates [around]{.underline} small [arms control,]{.underline}
DDR, and armed violence: [a desire to create a Weberian monopoly on
violence in liberal democratic states, based on the assumption of the
pacific character of development.]{.underline} But Cramer reminds us
that **[liberalism has violence built into it; and that liberal
democracies became liberal and democratic through violent
histories.]{.underline}** This is a useful corrective to the widespread
denial of the role of violence in creating the ideal type that is now
widely used as a template. Desire for a Weberian Monopoly on Violence A
fourth, and overarching, assumption of the [debate around]{.underline}
small [arms control]{.underline} [relates to the desirability of
a]{.underline} Weberian [monopoly on **legitimate**
violence]{.underline}. The literature abounds with apparently simple
descriptions of porous borders, insecure stockpiles, weak public
services, and state collapse.96 Small arms are widely understood to be
harmful to development, especially in developing countries in which
public institutions are 'predatory or failing'.97 In 1995, then-UN
Secretary General Boutros- Ghali referred to the contribution to
conflict of the 'collapse of state institutions, especially the police
and judiciary, with resulting paralysis of governance, a break- down of
law and order, and general banditry and chaos'.98 The theme continues to
resonate in today's conflicts. In Afghanistan, for example, political
violence by warlords is facilitated by a weak central state and the
factionalization of control of security institutions, and
'under-governed spaces' have emerged, according to the Small Arms
Survey.99 [More generally, there is often routine, **state-led armed
violence in many post-conflict environments** because 'the military,
police, and paramilitary more inclined to **pursue violent strategies**
than to deliver public security]{.underline}'.100 The policy
prescriptions that result from the seeming breakdown of the state's
monopoly on violence can be summarized under the umbrella statement of
Boutros-Ghali, that [international intervention must include 'the
re-establishment of effective government'.]{.underline}101 [Specifically
in relation to]{.underline} [organized violence]{.underline}, Muggah and
Krause argue that there is a need for 'the (re)construction of robust
national and local public authorities (especially in the security
sector)', which 'may be critically weakened or delegitimized by
prolonged periods of violent conflict'. In particular, 'the newly
established (or re-established) Weberian monopoly on the legitimate use
of force by state institutions' is crucial.102 Specific interventions
include the need to correct distortions in national budgeting to
facilitate a shift from military to welfare spending;103 military or
security sector integration as a means of 'right-sizing' military and
police structures104; and the need to engage or deal with 'spoilers'.105
[The Small Arms Survey argues that 'The only promising solution appears
to be state-building and restoration of the rule of law' and that
'disarmament works best when preceded by restoration of state authority,
not the other way round'.]{.underline}106 They, and NGOs, give the
example of the heavy-handed and coercive efforts of the Ugandan
government at disarming the Karimojong people; they are critical of the
means rather than the ends of this exercise.107 As they argue, 'there
are no shortcuts to nation-building'.108 Yet this assumes
nation-building to be an unproblematic goal. **[Recent attempts at
disarmament as a means to development have not only failed in their own
terms, they also replicate older practices of state-building from the
days of the dissolution of empire, which is precisely what is being
resisted by communities]{.underline}** such as the Karimojong, who 'have
never ceded their right to violence, or corporately acknowledged that
they constitute part of any state'.109 Small [**arms disarmament** is
therefore **deeply implicated in the attempt to** **produce modern**,
Weberian **nation- states**, a practice that is not universally
accepted.]{.underline}

#### Dominant states are self-serving in their interests when it comes to military intervention, power dynamics want to prevent weapon access to the third world that enables their autonomy.

In the [absence of external security assistance the constellation of
societal interests represented by the subordinate state would either not
have come to dominance in the first place or would at least have been
forced into different bargains with other interest groups?]{.underline}
either of which would have yielded different state structures and thus
definitions of security. It should be noted that the [presence of such
structural coercion implies neither a simple force nor a simple exchange
relation between dominant and subordinate states. It is not the former
because subordinate states \'consent\' to the hegemonic role of the
dominant state in defining their security. This consent may be created
and backed up with the threat of intervention, but there remains a
\'bargain\' with a local actor pursuing its own interests. At the same
time, however, the bargain is not an exchange relationship between
exogenously given actors, since the bargain constitutes the powers and
interests of dominant and subordinate states as such.]{.underline}
Informal empires, in other words, are constituted by a fusion of power
and social purpose in which the authority of dominant states penetrates
the territorial space of subordinate states. In effect, we are
suggesting that the formal authority structure of the Westphalian system
of sovereign states, which is \'anarchic\' in terms of Weber\'s
bureaucratic-legal definition of authority, is overlaid by informal
authority structures that correspond to something more like \'feudal\'
authority (and which in those terms are not \'anarchic\').[43Structures
of informal empire generate both supply- and demand-side incentives for
capital-intensive militarization in the Third World. On the supply-side,
dominant states have an interest in preventing their clients from
becoming militarily self-sufficient? that is, from developing a capacity
to deter security threats, including those from rebuffed patrons, with
their own resources.]{.underline} They may also have an interest,
however, in defraying their costs (and enlarging their export markets)
by encouraging their clients to become \'self-reliant\' (e.g. the Nixon
Doctrine). [Dominant states typically, if not necessarily
self-consciously, follow a two-pronged strategy for dealing with this
tension. The first is to limit clients\' access to weapons that might
enable them to deter or defeat military intervention by the patron,
particularly weapons of mass destruction. The second is to give access
to technologies that will encourage dependent militarization, in effect
encouraging the development of certain security means to reinforce
hegemonic security ends. In the case of the capital-poor Third World
this means making available arms and technology that will encourage
capital-intensive militarization.]{.underline}

#### North-South hierarchies in the arms control/trade reproduces imperial relations and are a part of a bigger agenda of controlled violence. Human rights focus hives off of violent conflict in the south/poorer countries.

The [analysis]{.underline} thus far [suggests that **weaknesses in** the
conceptualization of **small arms control are more fundamental** than
many scholar-practitioners imagine. The emerging dominant paradigm is an
improvement on conventional security studies in a number of ways. It
moves beyond great power politics]{.underline}, has a broader [set of
concerns beyond state security that include human security,]{.underline}
focusses on the majority world and their security concerns, and attempts
to take local subjectivities seriously. Despite this, small [**arms
control is marked** by the application of categories derived from an
idealized account of Northern historical development.]{.underline}
[It]{.underline} thus [remains **Eurocentric** in that it 'derives its
core categories and assumptions about world politics from a particular
understanding of European experience']{.underline}.120 Not only has
conceptual work stalled, but a **[Eurocentric conceptualization of
organized violence and its control means that programs will continue to
fail.]{.underline}** Beyond this, small [arms control is also marked by
a series of exclusions, which point to the lack of a common frame for
understanding armed violence. This serves to produce the South as a site
of intervention,]{.underline} contributing to the mutual constitution of
both North and South. Furthermore, the internationalizing policy
community that has emerged in relation to small [arms control is itself
**marked by North-South hierarchies**.]{.underline} Overall, then, small
[arms control is better understood as a moment in the **reproduction of
imperial relations**.]{.underline} There are [two main exclusions or
silences in play in small arms control: a geographical and a
technological one, both of which speak to wider questions of the social
relations of militarism and the world military order.]{.underline} Small
[arms control efforts are heavily geographically
circumscribed.]{.underline} In addition to the almost total exclusion of
Northern societies from the international public policy agenda, control
efforts are most prominent in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the
Balkans, while the Middle East, and South and East Asia receive far less
attention. The Small Arms Survey's three 'focus projects', for example,
are its Sudan Human Security Baseline Assessment, Timor-Leste Armed
Violence Assessment, and the Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and
Development. The latter 'strives to achieve measurable reductions in the
global burden of armed violence by 2015' and its focus countries are
Burundi, Guatemala, Jamaica, Kenya, Papua New Guinea, and
Timor-Leste.121 The [Control Arms campaign for a legally binding Arms
Trade Treaty]{.underline} (spearheaded by Amnesty International, Oxfam,
and the International Action Network on Small Arms), [meanwhile,
focusses on protecting human rights and development concerns in arms
transfer decisions]{.underline}. In practice, [this results in a focus
on transfers to the South, but to the exclusion of oil-rich Middle
Eastern states that are not, by definition, poor.122 This is emblematic
of a much wider exclusion, namely of the world military order and
questions of militarism.]{.underline} The small [arms debate
perpetuates]{.underline} a partial argument that reproduces [the
dominant conflict -- security]{.underline} -- development nexus that has
become central to post-Cold War international security,
[severs]{.underline} small [arms from the wider arms dynamic and world
military order, and **hives off violent conflict in the South** from the
wider spectrum of war and organized violence]{.underline}. The irony of
this is that the post-Cold War human security and conflict -- security
-- development approaches, and the [**focus on**]{.underline} small
[**arms**, were themselves **a response to** **a previous silence
created by the state-centrism** and obsession with major conventional
weaponry and nuclear weapons of]{.underline} Cold War [arms control
discourse. **But in filling that gap, they perpetuate their own
silences.**]{.underline} [The world military order, in which the
structure and dynamics of military activity are understood as a site of
interaction in their own right,]{.underline} albeit one shaped by and
shaping the wider social structures of which they are a part,123
includes intra-Northern production and trade and North--South transfers,
as well as South--South transfers and small arms proliferation,
practices that [**are gendered, racialized and class-based** in a
variety of ways.]{.underline} These all have different dynamics and
social relations, and facilitate different forms of violence, but need
to be studied together in a single frame. Martin Shaw argues that while
'[It seems difficult to conceptualize Western and non-Western warfare
together in a single frame . . .there is an overriding case for doing
so.'124]{.underline} Although scholars of armed violence may object that
the concept of warfare is no longer adequate for understanding, for
example, the blurred boundary between conflict and crime, an approach
based on a framework of militarism, defined as 'the penetration of
social relations in general by military relations',125 allows for
analysis of different modes of violence in different locales at
different times, all the while united by a single analytical frame. The
current absence of a single frame is another feature of Eurocentrism.126
As Kalyvas argues [in relation to understanding violence, the challenge
is to understand both the uniqueness and specificity of forms and
instances of violence, and also the deep and regular structural features
of it.127 Sophisticated analytical frameworks that have emerged in the
last five years or so seek to address the 'problem of classifying
different forms of violence' and 'erase or blur the analytic
distinctions between different forms of violence in order to bring
violence]{.underline} -- in all its social and political forms -- back
into the new thinking on security', as Krause argues.128 But while [this
sort of approach discusses the 'micro' and 'macro' levels, it sidelines
the international and historical context.]{.underline} While the
sociology of armed violence -- including factors such as social and
economic exclusion, urbanization, and marginalization129 -- is becoming
central to small arms control, the international relations of armed
violence remain conspicuous by their absence. There are no international
structural or historical forces evident in the debate around small arms
proliferation or its control, which are in turn not analyzed in
conjunction with wider patterns of military production and trade, or the
deployment of violence.

#### The aff begs the question of being liberal disarmament or controlling flows of violence to re-enforce settler hierarchies to justify their settlement.

The relatively [sharp distinction between arms control and
disarmament]{.underline} throughout the Cold War was intended, as noted
above, to avoid the utopian tinge of the latter, and to embed arms
control firmly in the arsenal of rational measures of state- craft. The
practical side of this was an emphasis on regulation and control, as
opposed to the reduction, elimination or abolition of weapons. There is
little doubt that some aspects of this distinction have eroded, in
particular with international efforts to ban anti-personnel land mines
(the Ottawa Treaty, entered into force in 1999), cluster munitions (the
Oslo Treaty, entered into force in 2010) and such things as blinding
lasers (1995 protocol to the CCW). In this sense [many current efforts
aim at **disarmament** as well as at arms control. But at a deeper
level, each of these]{.underline} three [instruments was **designed**
not just **to** abolish certain types of weapons (or their uses), but to
**regulate the use of force** via restrictions on certain weapons that
are employed in the context of a larger-scale military
operation.]{.underline} It makes little sense to view efforts such as
the banning of blinding lasers in isolation. Each of the instruments was
debated in terms of its impact (or not) on modern military operations,
and one way in which opposition to them was overcome was by pointing out
that the military utility of the weapons system in question was minimal,
or that acceptable substitutes existed.34 [Hence although so-called
humanitarian disarmament measures may limit the
destructiveness]{.underline} of war once it breaks out (for example, by
limited civilian casualties of anti-personnel land mines), [they do
little to achieve broader disarmament goals.]{.underline} It is also
[not clear that they contribute to a progressive process of weapons
reduction,]{.underline} especially given that, at least in the case of
anti-personnel land mines and cluster munitions, major powers such as
the United States or Russia have stood outside of the treaty. On this
account, in order for a measure to be considered a genuine disarmament
initiative, the logic of disarmament has to be respected in its entirety
(that is: progressive, gradual and cumulative) rather than being
specific to particular weapons**. [Humanitarian
disarmament]{.underline}** [initiatives to date are rather better
understood as one part of a military logic of self-restraint and
regulation in the use of violence, **consistent with the** **logic of
governmentality**]{.underline}. The new twist, however, was to break out
of the relatively narrow confines of the laws of war (international
humanitarian law) to link the use of particular weapons to broader
humanitarian considerations beyond those codified in the Geneva
Conventions and related instruments. These shifts are also part of a
broader normative development, at least since the middle of the 19th
century, to define (and restrict) what uses of force are and are not
legitimate. At the global level, the evolution of norms concerning such
violent practices as piracy, duelling, capital punishment,
inter-personal violence, and -- most importantly for our purposes -- the
legitimacy of violence for political ends, are all linked via what
Norbert Elias has called the civilizing process.35 [This normative
evolution concerned who could legitimately use what kinds of violence
against which people or groups and under what circumstances. Several
aspects of this constellation of norms concerning what uses of force are
and are not legitimate are directly linked to contemporary arms control
concerns.]{.underline} At the nuclear level, the extent to which it is
acceptable for liberal democratic states to hold their own populations
hostage as part of the balance of terror was always questionable, and
gave rise not only to so-called nuclear taboo but also, and in parallel,
the impulse to protect populations through ballistic missile defenses.36
Externally, the threat to engage in large-scale killing of civilians is
also probably less acceptable, and hence less credible as part of a
deterrent strategy. Current debates around the feasibility,
desirability, and acceptability of military strikes on a possible
Iranian nuclear weaponization program have some of this character, in
addition to the realpolitik considerations.37

During his first trip abroad as president of the United States, Donald
Trump made a \$110 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia. Trump, of
course, is just one among a long list of presidents who have brokered
arms deals with foreign powers on behalf of American manufacturers. And
the United States has long been the world's largest arms exporter---it
accounted for more than half of all arms-transfer agreements in the
world as recently as 2015. But historians interested in the subject will
struggle to find relevant historiography. As Brian DeLay (Univ. of
California, Berkeley) says, "the US arms trade, either domestically or
more specifically internationally, is something that has been shockingly
understudied by historians." [Emerging work,]{.underline} by DeLay and
others[, seeks to lay to rest the idea that large-scale arms trading in
the United States and elsewhere is a recent phenomenon,]{.underline}
originating in the post--World War II military-industrial complex. [The
trade in small arms and ammunition, these historians argue, has been a
key feature of domestic and international commerce and politics since at
least the early 17th century.]{.underline} Although military production
and trading would soar with World War II and the Cold War, [the sale of
complicated air and naval systems isn't where this history
begins.]{.underline} Long before early 19th-century industrialization
trans­formed arms manufacturing in the United States, the continent was
flush with guns. According to David Silverman (George Washington Univ.),
the earliest trade in firearms developed between European colonial
powers and indigenous nations. His book Thundersticks: Firearms and the
Violent Transformation of Native America (2016) shows that once the
Dutch flintlock musket was introduced in the 1630s, Iroquois League
nations began trading for them, becoming "the preeminent military power
of the Northeast and Great Lakes regions." The threat posed by armed
Iroquois peoples set off an arms race that spread to the Pacific
Northwest by the 18th century. A great deal of weapons trading and
stockpiling, Silverman writes, took place in Quebec, Jamestown, and
Plymouth, before settlers even arrived in other colonies, such as
Pennsylvania and Georgia. [Emerging work seeks to lay to rest the idea
that large-scale arms trading is a recent phenomenon]{.underline}. [It's
been part of commerce and politics since at least the early 17th
century.]{.underline} The fact that indigenous nations had steady access
to firearms markets and used guns in warfare contradicts a major tenet
of Jared Diamond's "guns, germs, and steel" theory: that disease and
technological superiority were behind the European conquest of the
Americas[. "There's a widespread assumption that Native people were
subjugated by European Americans because of a disadvantage in arms, and
that's just not true,"]{.underline} says Silverman. "[They routinely got
the very best of firearms technology and used those guns more
effectively than white settlers. And white governments routinely
struggled to control the trade in arms to Native people."]{.underline}
In his book, Silverman points to Crazy Horse's surrender of more than
200 firearms to US troops in 1877 and notes, "Clearly, a lack of weapons
had nothing to do with the Lakotas' capitulation to the Americans."
Instead, Silverman argues, other factors contributed to the eventual
undoing of Native military resistance: starvation, "war weariness,"
inter­tribal conflict, and decline in population compared to settlers,
who benefited from high birth rates and migration. In fact, [if it
hadn't been for their adoption of firearms and participation in arms
trading, Silverman notes, indigenous nations would not have been able to
sustain resistance for as long as they did. The ability to trade in
firearms was similarly crucial to other resistance efforts, such as the
American Revolution]{.underline}, on the continent. When the colonies
began rebelling in 1765, they lacked the ability to manufacture
significant quantities of firearms or gunpowder. Britain also forbade
arms exports to the colonies; in 1775, for example, the colonial militia
ran out of ammunition at the Battle of Bunker Hill and had to withdraw,
despite inflicting severe damage on British forces. Only when the French
began supplying the colonists with munitions did the tide of war shift.
As DeLay says, "What happens during the American Revolution is supremely
important for the history of the arms trade." In research for a coming
book, Shoot the State, he found that after the revolution, "[the
governing classes in the new United States agree across partisan lines
that in order to endure and to grow in a world that is dominated by
mighty empires, the United States has to rapidly become self-sufficient
in firearms and war materiel."]{.underline} The federal government thus
established state-run gun arsenals such as the one in Harper's Ferry and
awarded contracts and tariff breaks to private manufacturers. This soon
made the country autonomous with regard to arms manufacturing. Andrew
Fagal (Princeton Univ.), who is writing a monograph on the development
of the arms manufacturing industry, says that [the United States went
from being "largely dependent upon foreign sources for arms and
ammunitions to a country that by the War of 1812 was largely
self-sufficient and a net exporter of weapons."]{.underline} This shift
was monumental not just for the United States but for the entire Western
Hemisphere, says [DeLay: "For the first time, there was in the Western
Hemisphere an independent republic that was under no obligation to other
colonial powers, i]{.underline}n terms of treaties and alliances, to
restrain its own merchants." [**What developed was trade in firearms and
munitions, both licit and illicit, which played a major role in
decolonization** efforts throughout the Americas]{.underline}. Fagal
writes in his dissertation that by 1805, [New York City merchants
trading in guns and munitions were engaged in such brisk business
throughout Latin America that French generals complained that it allowed
Haitian revolutionaries easy access to firearms and the ability to keep
up their struggle]{.underline}. [Spain's fate in the Americas was also
complicated by the arms trade]{.underline}: despite its efforts to
control commerce at its Spanish American ports, DeLay notes, [US
merchants' illicit arms trading played a "critical role" in the success
of the Spanish American wars of independence in the early 19th century.
The early history of firearms trading and manufacturing is thus
transnational and complex, involving European imperial powers,
anti-­imperial revolutionary forces throughout the Americas, indigenous
nations, private arms dealers and manufacturers, and other
actors]{.underline}. But the early American republic wasn't an isolated
arena for growth in arms trading; guns helped foster empire and spur the
global political economy in the 18th and early 19th centuries. "There's
a widespread assumption that Native people were subjugated by European
Americans because of a disadvantage in arms, and that's just not true."
Priya Satia (Stanford Univ.), who is writing a book titled Empire of
Guns: The Violent Making of the Industrial Revolution, says that arms
manufacturing and trading were not only major drivers of the Industrial
Revolution in Britain, they were also what allowed "British armies,
navies, mercenaries, traders, settlers, and adventurers to conquer an
immense share of the globe." Pointing out that Britain was in a state of
"continuous war" during the height of the Industrial Revolution, she
says that nearly every industry in the country at the time "was in some
way contributing to war." Britain "knew arms manufacture was triggering
industrial revolution at home" and therefore quashed local
arms-manufacturing industries in its colonies, such as those in South
Asia. At the same time, the country "permitted voluminous gun sales" to
them. Paralleling Silverman's thesis about indigenous nations, Satia
concludes, "the conquest of India is not about British technological
superiority." This progression from perpetual war to economic growth
through arms trading sounds similar to the modern concept of the
military-­industrial complex. But in a subtle variation, Satia refers to
18th-century Britain as a "military-industrial society": every sector of
the political, social, and industrial world was affected by weapons.
Despite this rich, expansive history, these scholars see little interest
in it within the academic history community. Books, documentaries, and
entertainment about warfare, firearms, and the military are in high
demand among popular audiences, but according to Silverman, scholarship
on these subjects lags. "Effectively, since World War II, and especially
since the 1960s," he says, "academics have drifted away from those
topics." DeLay also notes that the transnational nature of arms trading
"doesn't fit easily alongside most of the established research
priorities" in the discipline, which, he says, still organize
"historical knowledge around nation states." Furthermore, as Satia
notes, the illicit nature of much of the early trade in firearms makes
it hard for historians to find sources, discouraging them from
undertaking research on the topic. Satia, however, sounds a call to
historians: arms trading matters. In leaving the writing of the history
of guns and the gun trade to those interested mainly in firearms' value
as collectors' objects or in "celebrating the old American gun culture,"
she says, historians have ceded it to gun enthusiasts. [Arms trading,
s]{.underline}he says, [can tell historians much about "state economy
and culture, society, international relations, and so on, that's lost in
the fetishization of the particularities of old guns."]{.underline}
DeLay agrees. In addition to contributing to knowledge about foreign
relations, "[the arms trade also speaks to the history of
capitalism]{.underline}" and state making in "pretty urgent and
fascinating ways," he says. Finally, DeLay argues, studying the arms
trade can help historians understand power relations: ["If we reflect
upon the power asymmetries and the patterns of domination and resistance
and the inequalities within the United States and between the United
States and other parts of the world, you'll see that guns are everywhere
in those relationships, structuring those relationships."]{.underline}
As the United States hurtles inevitably to more arms deals, it would be
remiss for historians not to dig deeper.

Why does Britain arm human rights abusers? On the face of it, this is a
nonsensical question. The British state is a human rights abuser, from
Iraq to Afghanistan. On a scale calibrated according to those
atrocities, what do a few bits of kit to Iran matter? What ethical
barrier should stop Britain sending crowd control ammunition to Saudi
Arabia, or assault rifles to Bahrain? Yet this is to deflect an
important political question. The arms industry accounts for 1.2% of all
exports and 0.2% of all jobs in the UK. Economically, it is negligible.
And, were it not for high-pressure sales and marketing departments
working in the British government on behalf of the industry, it would be
even more puny. So what accounts for the extent of state efforts to find
clients for the manufacturers of weapons? Why has the British government
always found the means to subsidise important arms purchases, through
export credits? Here, it is not sufficient to invoke commercial cynicism
or corruption[. To explain it, one must insist on the \"primacy of
politics]{.underline}\". **[That is, arms flows are centrally about
powerful states taking sides in global political
struggles]{.underline}**, [whether they are open and violent as in
Bahrain in 2011, or submerged as in Belarus today]{.underline}. **[The
transfer of weapons is simply one particularly sharp and bloodied edge
of the projection of imperial power.]{.underline}** In and of
themselves, [individual trades may be of limited
significance.]{.underline} Some news stories have alighted on a few
transfers of minor significance to Iran and Syria, which seem to be at
odds with Britain\'s current foreign policy stance[. Rather than sifting
through the receipts for arms trades, like tea leaves, looking for
patterns, it makes more sense to begin by asking what the geopolitical
priorities of the producer states\' are, and how arms sales contribute
to realising them.]{.underline} This is unhelpfully obscured by
well-meaning moral condemnations of \"arming repressive regimes\". All
regimes are repressive to some extent -- that\'s what weapons are for.
**[The question is what strategic alliances are being forged and
sustained]{.underline}**. [Any]{.underline} British [government these
days will send a small mountain of arms to Saudi Arabia and Israel on a
regular basis. Both of these are states which the British empire had a
role in creating, and both represent long-term strategic commitments on
the part of the UK]{.underline}. On the other hand, [some arms flows
reflect temporary tilts, tactical interventions.]{.underline} Examples
include the increased flow of weapons to Bahrain two years ago, or -- in
the early 2000s -- to Indonesia when it was suppressing the Acehnese
rebellion. This is not to deny that immediate economic considerations
have a role. Once the British state has decided that its arms industry
is an important lever, it becomes necessary to support its operation by
seeking as many clients as possible. The arms selling wing of the UK
Trade & Investment department employs 160 civil servants. More broadly,
arms development and sales has had a peculiar, fluctuating combination
of economic functions since the end of the second world war. It has
enabled states with large military complexes to boost growth and
employment through temporary military expenditures, and has given them a
means through which to indirectly organise national economies. Moreover,
the strategic pre-eminence of the arms industry for the British state --
the existence of taxpayer-funded lobbying and marketing bodies within
the state, dedicated to specifically supporting arms deals -- makes it
ripe for clientelism, bribery and corruption. According to the late
Robin Cook, BAE Systems \"appeared to have the key to the garden door at
Number 10\" under New Labour. However, the [commercial considerations
would be relatively insignificant, the corruption easily extirpated,
were it not for the political role the arms trade fulfils. The
old-fashioned word for it is imperialism.]{.underline}

The structure of governance. [Democracy is conventionally understood as
'rule by the people.']{.underline} But [who are the people, and how
should they rule?]{.underline} Paradoxically[, these puzzles cannot be
solved democratically]{.underline}. The first is political theory's
infamous 'boundary problem,' well stated by Jennings: '[The people
cannot decide until someone decides who are the people.]{.underline}'7
7. Ivor Jennings, The Approach to Self-government (Cambridge: Cambridge
University Press, 1956), 56. The second puzzle is no easier -- the
people cannot decide until someone decides by what rules decisions
should be made. [Issacharoff characterizes these as first-order
decisions, foundational and thus 'constitutionally prior' to
democracy]{.underline}.8 8. Issacharoff, 'Democracy and Collective
Decision Making', 231. Ideally, such decisions are fixed before a
government is up and running. In the classic American case, the federal
demoi were identified, and their shares of power allotted, during the
framing of the Constitution. The Great Compromise was just that -- a
'structure of governance' deal, hammered out between the big and small
states, so everyone could get on with other business. What other
business? For one, formalizing what I will call second-order political
arrangements, which address how power is to be exercised once governance
is underway. [Second-order matters include rules and rights that fall
under what is sometimes termed 'the law of democracy]{.underline}'9 9.

Democracy: Legal Structure of the Political Process (New York:
Foundation Press, 2002). View all notes -- the guidelines of the
democratic process. These guidelines govern everything from campaign
funding to durational-residency requirements to electoral districting.
[Unlike first-order arrangements, second-order laws of democracy attach
to individuals, not demoi.]{.underline} Rather than enshrining
collective self-determination, they guard difference-blind and
egalitarian liberal principles[. Yet as American federalism makes clear,
first-order decisions complexly entwine with second-order
ones.]{.underline} Take the aforementioned Great Compromise. Because of
it, California, the most populous state, and Wyoming, the least, enjoy
equal representation in the U.S. Senate. Though this is a first-order
arrangement, it has staggering consequences 'downstream,' for the
second-order law of democracy. There, the federal voting power of
individual Californians is a fraction that of Wyomingites. Normally this
would be untenable, transgressing 'one person, one vote.' However, since
the Great Compromise is constitutionally entrenched, Californians have
no legal recourse. The flow of consequences cannot be reversed to wash
upstream. But elsewhere this may not be the case. Demotic boundaries are
not always drawn, much less enshrined, pre-politically. First-order
conflicts may burst into the arena of everyday politics when there
develops a fervent demand to re-level the foundations of governance.10

emerging with increasing frequency, taking diverse forms. [What is to be
done when a faction locks up power via gerrymandering? How should shares

state demos? May a restive group break away? With democracy incapable of
answering these dilemmas, courts are increasingly stepping

View all notes Even more vexingly, first-order cases can be hard to
distinguish, or disentangle, from second-order cases. Individual
plaintiffs may protest ethnic discrimination that ensues from an
upstream consociational compromise, as in the aforementioned Bosnian
Sejdić and Finci case. Or, they may allege that their voting power is
unfairly diluted as a consequence of a first-order power-sharing
agreement, as in the German Maastricht case. In such cases, courts may
find themselves unmoored. As Fraser notes, 'normal justice' is simply
about balancing the scale: a bit left, a tad right, and equilibrium is
achieved. But in 'abnormal' conditions, where pre-political assumptions
are in dispute, Fraser suggests judges must take a step back and begin
with first-order questions. What is the appropriate scale to use? Who is
the rightful subject of justice? How should justice be framed? Though
seemingly abstract, these questions are elemental. This is because, in
abnormal justice, the frame often foreordains the result. Take the
aforementioned Reynolds case. There, the plaintiff charged that
apportioning Alabama state senate seats equally by county diluted his
voting power, violating the Equal Protection Clause of the
Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment. Alabama countered with the 'federal
analogy': The U.S. Senate apportions equally by state, so why can't we
apportion equally by county? Chief Justice Warren deemed this analogy
'inapposite,' writing, 'Political subdivisions of states -- counties,
cities, or whatever -- never were and never have been considered as
sovereign entities.'22 22. Reynolds v. Sims 377 U.S. 533 (1964), 377.
View all notes In effect, he denied that Alabama's political
subdivisions bear first-order demotic rights. The sole legitimate
subject of justice was deemed to be the plaintiff, owed 'one person, one
vote.' As history shows, this finding flowed upstream. The first-order
structure of governance of almost every state was radically amended. It
can be seen, then, that demotic bounding complexly interlinks with
everyday democratic rules. Hence, scholars have urged judges to enter
this realm with caution.23 23. See among others: Pildes,
'Constitutionalization of Democratic Politics'; Issacharoff, 'Democracy
and Collective Decision Making'; Christopher McCrudden and Brendan
O'Leary, Courts and Consociations (Oxford: Oxford University Press,
2013). View all notes Issacharoff warns of the danger of overlooking
first-order implications: '\[C\]ourts should be wary of following their
impulses to treat such ... conflicts about the structure of political
systems as familiar claims of individual rights.'24 24. Issacharoff,
'Democracy and Collective Decision Making', 231. View all notes Fraser
fears the opposite, that the foundational integrity of the state will
overshadow second-order pleas for justice. But her solution is the same:
Judges must be cognizant of how justice is framed. To do this, they must
adjudicate 'reflexively,' grappling with what scale of justice to use
before trying to level the balance.25 25. Fraser, Scales of Justice, 61.
View all notes I suggest there is even greater cause for judicial
caution. First-order cases may be strategically camouflaged as
second-order cases. Despite appearances, plaintiffs' primary objective
may not be to liberalize the law but, quite conversely, to shake up the
foundations of governance so their own group comes to dominate. This
might occur where remedying second-order illiberalism would have an
upstream effect, undermining pre-political first order arrangements,
much as occurred in Reynolds. As I will show next, such caution is
especially warranted in cases of settler colonialism.
Settler-colonialism and the structure of governance [As Wolfe famously
observed, settler colonialism is an insidious and especially resilient
variant of conventional colonialism. Impelled by what he terms a 'logic
of elimination,' settler-colonists kill, expel, confine or assimilate
the locals, seize their homelands, and found 'a new colonial society on
the expropriated land base.]{.underline}'26 26. Patrick Wolfe, 'Settler

how [settlers, pursuing a 'logic of elimination,' have in recent decades
sought to wield rights, moving them from the realm of rhetoric into the
arena of the courts. This article explores that tactic, showing how
assertions of settler rights regarding voting, mobility and expression
were employed in an effort to undermine the first-order foundations of
Indigenous governance -- to alter the answer to 'who are the people and
how should they rule?' Where Indigenous peoples were once sovereign,
settlers strived to dissolve that sovereignty, overturning the
pre-colonial order, flipping the demos from 'them' to 'us.']{.underline}

**The discourse that the Courts follow and set precedent is inherently
founded upon on Colonialist ideologies and continues to replicate those
practices to set it's dominance over Native people.**

**Miller '11---**Robert J. Miller is a professor at Arizona State
University and his areas of expertise are civil procedure, federal
Indian law, American Indians and international law. (4/8/2011),
"Christianity, American Indians, and the Doctrine of Discovery",
https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1803674//RC)

In 1823, [in **Johnson v. M'Intosh, the U.S. Supreme Court held that
Discovery** was an **established legal principle of English colonial
law** and American law. In a nutshell, Discovery meant that **when
European Christian nations encountered new lands** that the discovering
country **automatically gained property rights** over non-Christian
nations even though the Native people already owned, occupied, and were
using their lands.]{.underline}40 [In addition, the **discovering
country also gained governmental rights over the Native people** and
their governments which restricted tribal international political
relationships and trade.]{.underline} The [Supreme Court stated that
"discovery gave title to the government by whose subjects, or by whose
authority, it was made against all other European governments, which
title might be consummated by possession]{.underline}."41 [Native
property rights, however, were "in no instance, entirely disregarded;
but were necessarily, to a considerable extent,
impaired.]{.underline}"42 [This was so because the **Doctrine
recognized** that Natives still held a right to occupy and use their
lands but "**their rights to complete sovereignty**, as independent
nations, were necessarily **diminished,** and their power to **dispose**
of the soil **at** their own **will**, to whomsoever they pleased, was
denied by the original fundamental principle, that discovery gave
exclusive title to those who made it."]{.underline} I have identified
ten distinct elements of the Doctrine.44 Part two: Re-Discovering the
Concept of Discovery 1. Christianity. Religion was a significant aspect
of the Doctrine. Under Discovery, non-Christian peoples did not have the
same rights to land, sovereignty, and self-determination as
Christians.2. Civilization. The Euro-American definition of civilization
was an [important part of Discovery and of ideas of Euro-American
superiority]{.underline}. [Euro-Americans thought that God]{.underline}
[had directed them to bring civilized ways]{.underline}, education, and
religion to indigenous peoples and to exercise paternalistic and
guardianship powers over them. 3. First discovery. [The first European
country to discover lands unknown to other Europeans gained property and
sovereign rights over the lands and peoples.]{.underline} 4. Actual
occupancy and current possession. To acquire complete title, a
discovering country had to actually occupy and possess the newly found
lands, usually by building forts or settlements. 5. [Preemption. The
discovering country gained the power of preemption, that is, the sole
right to buy the lands from the Native people]{.underline}. 6. Indian
title. [Indian Nations were considered by Euro-American legal systems to
have lost the full ownership of their lands.]{.underline} They only
retained occupancy and use rights. 7. T[ribal limited sovereign and
commercial rights. Indian Nations and Native peoples were considered to
have lost some of their sovereignty and rights to international trade
and diplomacy]{.underline}. Thereafter, they could only deal with the
Euro-American government that had discovered them. 8. Contiguity.
Europeans claimed a significant amount of land surrounding their
settlements. The discovery of the mouth of a river, for example, created
a claim over the entire drainage system. Notice the shapes of the
Louisiana Territory and Oregon Country.9. [Terra nullius. The phrase
means a land that is void or empty. If lands were not occupied by any
people or were being used in a fashion that Euro-American legal systems
disapproved, then the lands were available for Discovery
claims]{.underline}. 10. [Conquest. This element has two
meanings]{.underline} as described in Johnson. [**The Court defined
military victory in "just"** and necessary wars as one way to acquire
the Indian title. But conquest also described the Miller---Christianity,
American Indians, and the Doctrine of Discovery property rights that
Europeans gained automatically by first discovery; in essence, the first
discovery was like a military conquest.]{.underline} The **[Supreme
Court expressly used the two elements that we are focusing on,
Christianity and civilization, to justify Discovery.]{.underline}**
[According to the Court, the Doctrine of Discovery applied in the New
World because of the different cultures, religions, and savageness of
Native Americans. On the discovery of this immense continent, the great
nations of Europe were eager to appropriate to themselves so much of it
as they could respectively acquire.]{.underline} Its vast extent offered
an ample field to the ambition and enterprise of all; and [the character
and religion of its inhabitants afforded an apology for considering them
as a people over whom the superior genius of Europe might claim an
ascendency. The potentates of the old world found no difficulty in
convincing themselves that they made ample compensation to the
inhabitants of the new, by bestowing on them civilization and
Christianity, in exchange for unlimited independence. The Court also
added: "Although we do not mean to engage in the defense of those
principles which Europeans have applied to Indian title, they may, we
think, **find some excuse, if not justification**, in the character and
habits of the people whose rights have been wrested from
them."4]{.underline}6 [Discovery in the American States It is no
surprise that European civilizations and religions were used by the
English colonies and later American governments]{.underline}. The
Puritans, for example, felt that "they were charged with a special
spiritual and political destiny, to create in the New World a church and
a society that would provide the model for all the nations of Europe. .
. ."47 The [English colonial governments assumed that]{.underline} the
Crown held [the Discovery power and that the colonies were authorized to
conduct political affairs and commercial transactions with Indian
Nations under this]{.underline}. [Ironically, Indians were considered
compensated for their loss of property and sovereignty with the very two
things responsible for justifying that loss, civilization and
religion]{.underline}. All thirteen colonies enacted numerous laws
exercising Discovery powers to purchase Indian lands and to protect the
colonial right of preemption and sovereignty over tribes. The colonies
repeatedly relied on religion, cultural differences, and "civilization"
to justify their claims over Indians.48 The new American state
governments that formed after the Revolution immediately utilized
Discovery. The [states began adopting constitutions and enacting
statutes in which they asserted the same powers and superiority over
Indians that they had claimed during colonial times. In fact, several
states immediately enshrined the Doctrine of Discovery in their new
constitutions and laws]{.underline}.49 For example, the Tennessee
[Supreme Court upheld the authority of the state to extend criminal
jurisdiction into Indian country. The court relied on the elements of
Discovery and "the law of Christendom" to hold that the state possessed
sovereign power over Indians, "the unconverted natives."]{.underline}50
[A concurring justice also **raised the idea of "just war**" and wrote
that if Indian tribes resisted Americans taking their lands that
Americans could "use force to repel such resistance."]{.underline}51
[Pennsylvania Supreme Court stated that Indians could not own real
property since "not being Christians, but mere heathens \[they are\]
unworthy of the earth."]{.underline}52 And, in 1808, the [New York
Supreme Court used cultural justifications to denigrate the Mohawk
Nation's ownership of land because the tribe's "wandering and unsettled
life" was "wholly in]{.underline}48. [Miller, Native America, Discovered
and Conquered]{.underline}, 25--33; Francis Paul Prucha, The Great
Father: The United States Government and the American Indians "[The
principle declared in the fifteenth century as the law]{.underline} of
Christendom, that discovery gave title to assume sovereignty over, and
to govern the unconverted natives of Africa, Asia, and North and South
America, [has been recognized as a part of the national
law]{.underline}, for nearly four centuries" (277). consistent with the
idea of a permanent . . . possession."53 **[These judicial statements
demonstrate graphically the religious and cultural bias that lurks
behind the Doctrine of Discovery.]{.underline}** [The evidence proves
that the United States also adopted the Doctrine of Discovery and its
justifications of culture, civilization, and Christianity to exercise
sovereign, cultural, and religious dominance over Indian
Nations]{.underline}.54 In the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, for example,
designed to open the Ohio area to settlement, the Articles of
Confederation Congress expressly adopted Discovery: "The utmost good
faith shall always be observed towards the Indians, their lands and
property shall never be taken from them without their consent; and in
their property, rights and liberty, they shall never be invaded or
disturbed, unless in just and lawful wars. . . ."55 This statute
expressly required consent for sales of tribal lands, exercised the
government's exclusive preemption power, and raised the specter of "just
war." In 1790, our first Congress under the U.S. Constitution expressly
adopted Discovery and preemption: \[N\]o sale of lands made by an
Indian, or any nation or tribe of Indians within the United States,
shall be valid to any person or persons, or to any state, whether having
the right of pre-emption to such lands or not, unless the same shall be
made and duly executed at some public treaty, held under the authority
of the United States.56 And, the U.S. Supreme Court expressly adopted
Discovery as American law in Johnson v. M'Intosh in 1823 and relied on
its elements of civilization and Christianity to claim superior property
and sovereign rights over Native people. Historians state that
[**Manifest Destiny is exemplified** by three basic
aspects]{.underline}: First, [**the United States has unique moral
virtues**]{.underline} that other count part two: Re-Discovering the
Concept of Discovery tries do not possess. **[Second, the United States
has a mission to redeem the world by spreading democracy and the
American way of life around the globe]{.underline}**. [Third, America
has a divinely ordained destiny to accomplish these
tasks.]{.underline}57 [This kind of thinking arises from an ethnocentric
view that one's own culture, government, race, religion, and country are
superior to all others. This kind of thinking justified and motivated
the development of Discovery in the fifteenth century and the idea of
Manifest Destiny in the nineteenth century.]{.underline}

#### The Courts define what rights the Settler has and only upholds/checks the law made by the Settler originally. 

**Miller '11---**Robert J. Miller is a professor at Arizona State

Indian law, American Indians and international law. (8/31/2011), "The

The [U.S. Supreme Court interpreted Discovery]{.underline} [to mean that
when European, Christian nations discovered lands unknown to Europeans,
they automatically gained sovereign and property rights in the
lands.]{.underline} [This was so, even though Indigenous people were
already occupying and using them.]{.underline}12 The [real property
right Europeans acquired, however, was a future right, a title held by
the discovering European country in the lands, but subject to the
continuing use and occupancy rights of the Indigenous
peoples]{.underline}.13 In addition, [the Settler also gained sovereign
governmental powers over the native peoples and their governments which
restricted tribal international political, commercial, and diplomatic
powers.]{.underline}14 This [transfer of rights was accomplished without
the knowledge or consent of native peoples]{.underline}.15 In
**[Johnson, the Supreme Court defined the exclusive property rights a
discovering European country acquired:]{.underline}** [―\[D\]iscovery
gave title to the government by whose subjects, or by whose
authority,]{.underline} it was made against all other European
governments, [which title might be consummated by possession.‖16
Accordingly, European discoverers gained real property rights in the
lands of Indigenous peoples by merely walking ashore and planting a
flag. Native rights were ―in no instance, entirely disregarded; but were
necessarily, to a considerable extent, impaired.‖]{.underline}17 This
was so, **[the Court claimed, because although the Doctrine recognized
that natives still had the legal rights to possess, occupy, and use
their lands as long as they wished, their right to sell their lands to
whomever they wished and for whatever price they could negotiate was
destroyed:]{.underline}** ―[their rights to complete sovereignty, as
independent nations, were necessarily diminished, and their power to
dispose of the soil at their own will, to whomsoever they pleased, was
denied by the original fundamental principle, that **discovery gave
exclusive title to those who made it**.‖]{.underline}18 [Indigenous
nations were thus preempted from selling their lands to anyone except
the discovering European country. The discovering country thus acquired
an exclusive option to purchase tribal lands whenever tribal governments
consented to sell.]{.underline}19 Obviously, [Discovery d**iminished the
economic value** of land for natives and greatly benefited European
countries and colonists]{.underline}.20 Moreover, Indigenous sovereign
powers were greatly affected by the Doctrine because **[their national
sovereignty and independence were considered to have been limited by
Discovery since it restricted Indigenous nations' international
diplomacy, commercial, and political activities to only the discovering
European country]{.underline}**.21 [Later statements by colonists and
**courts** reinforced the idea that the assumed ―civilization of
Europeans justified the domination of Aboriginals.]{.underline} For
example, the Supreme Court of New South Wales stated in 1836 that
Aboriginal peoples ―had not attained . . . to such a position in point
of numbers and civilisation, and to such a form of Government and laws,
as to be entitled as so many sovereign states governed by law of their
own.‖ And colonists often compared Aboriginal people to monkeys and saw
them as the link between primates and modern man. A Methodist missionary
wrote in the 1830s: ―It is the universal opinion of all who have seen
them that it is impossible to find men and women sunk lower in the scale
of human society. With regards to their manners and customs, they are
little better than the beasts.‖491 One professor comments that these
views about the racial superiority of Europeans were still dominant in
the 1880s and 1890s when the Australian Constitution was being drafted
because ―it was underpinned with the assumption that Aboriginal people,
due to their inferiority and inability to cope with the onset of
civilization, were a dying race.‖492

As the [Court implied in *Worcester*, in 1832, tribes could voluntarily
give up aspects of their sovereignty and parts of their territory in
treaties, and Congress could take other aspects of tribal sovereignty
without tribal consent pursuant to its plenary power.]{.underline}522
After [*Worcester*, the Court rarely addressed this issue again although
Congress continued full tilt enacting statutes and federal policies
under its plenary power authority that limited and impacted tribal
powers]{.underline}.523 Finally [in 1978, **the Court** returned to and
**expanded this principle in *Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe***. In
*Oliphant*, the Court **held** that the inherent sovereign authority of
Indian tribes did not include jurisdiction to criminally prosecute
non-Indians; if tribes had ever had such an authority, **it had not
survived tribal incorporation into the United States.**]{.underline}525
**[The Court relied on the principle of the diminished sovereign status
of tribes and stated that tribes could not have such jurisdiction
because it would be "inconsistent with their status."]{.underline}**526
[The Court then added a new provision to this basic Indian law
principle. In essence, *Oliphant* and the diminished sovereignty
principle hold that tribes retain those aspects of their inherent
sovereignty which they have not voluntarily divested themselves of, by
treaty for example, or which Congress has not taken by statute pursuant
to its plenary power, or, as *Oliphant* added, that they have not lost
implicitly by virtue of their dependent status upon the United States.
Thus, tribes are diminished sovereigns. It bears repeating that the
original limitations on tribal sovereignty, and the idea of the
dependent status of tribes, comes from the principles of
Discovery]{.underline}.527

### L -- Cybernetics

#### The affirmative presupposes cybernetic capital as a new manifestation of control, which obfuscates the foundational ways in which speculation has been central to regimes of settler control and clearing. They mirror the discourse of terra nullius that justifies violence.

Spatio-Temporality and Settler Colonialism Before we close this section,
I want to make note of the ways in which primitive accumulation has
received a fair amount of attention within the Humanities following
David Harvey\'s update to Rosa Luxemburg in [the articulation of capital
accumulation as grounded in processes of \"accumulation by
dispossession.\"]{.underline} There has been some [debate]{.underline}
within settler colonial studies [about]{.underline} this
[updating]{.underline} of [the concept of primitive
accumulation.]{.underline} Glen Coulthard has recently urged a focus on
the spatial logic of dispossession inherent in primitive accumulation,
against what he argues is the traditional understanding of primitive
accumulation as the putting into place of a temporal logic: the
wage-form, with its exploitation of the worker\'s time.80 I want to
think here about Coulthard\'s intervention into political-economic
accounts that occlude the spatial dynamics of settler dispossessions,
and consider this work in relation to Brenna Bhandar\'s recent
investigations of the temporality of settler colonialism.81 For Bhandar,
**[settler colonialism puts into place a property-logic]{.underline}**
[that is significantly different from feudal use-based conceptions of
land. In some contrast to pre-capitalist formations]{.underline},
**[settler colonialism constitutes the leading edge of capitalist forms
of speculative possession]{.underline}**. If at one point, [property
ownership was demonstrated in use]{.underline} (alternately,
\"occupation\"), [capitalist expropriation depends on \"expectation of
use.\"]{.underline} Or, speculation: \"\"[Whereas possession and use
once justified ownership, the commoditization of land witnessed **a
shift in the conceptual underpinnings of ownership
itself**]{.underline}. While Locke had reconceived of land ownership, as
based not on hereditary titles and inheritance (birthright), but on
labor, Jeremy [Bentham emphasizes **expectation and security as the key
justifications for private property ownership**]{.underline}. In the
work of Bentham, we see [an abstract notion of ownership]{.underline}
**[not based on physical possession, occupation, or even use, but the
concept of ownership as a relation]{.underline}**, **[based on an
expectation of being able to use the property as one
wishes]{.underline}**. Primary to the [property relation is
law]{.underline}, which [secures the property relation,]{.underline} or
**[guards and protects the expectation]{.underline}**.\"82
[Speculation]{.underline} - the [expectation of use]{.underline} -
**[requires the imposition of terrus nullius,]{.underline}**
[or]{.underline} what Bhandar describes as a \"**[wasteland rationale\":
the legal codification of land as unpopulated]{.underline}** [**to
justify** the **speculative possession** that ensues]{.underline}. The
force of Bhandar\'s argument here is to show that forms of [speculative
possession legitimate not only settler expropriations, but the property
form more broadly. The dynamics of speculation are not confined to
either financialization or the settler-form]{.underline}. Neither are
the specifics of capitalist possession simply a bureaucratic carapace.
Rather, **[they put in motion a range of affects]{.underline}**
(**[e.g., of expectation]{.underline}**) **[that are inextricable from
the property-form and from racialization more broadly]{.underline}**.
[This feeling of expectation \"comes to be materialized, or \... to have
an actual life, in how we are constituted as subjects]{.underline}\"
(12). \"[Possession]{.underline} \... **[as a feeling]{.underline}**
\... **[become\[s\] the sine qua non of ownership]{.underline}**\" (12).
\"[Emergent forms of property ownership]{.underline},\" Bhandar argues,
[along with **the affective effects of property**]{.underline},
\"**[were constituted with racial ontologies of settler and native,
master and slave]{.underline}**. [This is as evident in the burgeoning
realm of finance capital and its relationship to the slave trade as it
is with regard to transformations in how the ownership of land is
conceptualized in the colonial settler context.\" **Ontology
itself,**]{.underline} then**[, has a history]{.underline}**. [Its
history is in many ways]{.underline} **[crystallized in the legal
forms]{.underline}** [that remain with us still, and]{.underline} **[in
the affective, economic, and political dimensions of racialization and
settler colonialism]{.underline}**. Put another way: \"[the relationship
between being and having, or ontology and property ownership animates
modern theories of citizenship and law]{.underline}\" (3). **[Ontology
cannot be thought outside of the spatial dispossessions]{.underline}**
to which Coulthard draws our attention. [Nor can it be thought outside
of the temporal character]{.underline} that Bhandar demonstrates as
[encoded in property relations.]{.underline} [Bhandar and Coulthard
together direct us toward an understanding of Marx\'s]{.underline}
**[annihilation of space by time as a racialized, spatial, settler
expropriation]{.underline}** **[that]{.underline}** simultaneously
deploys - indeed, [**weaponizes - temporality as a form of
speculation.** This spatio-temporal type of dispossession]{.underline}
**[sets into place the property form and racial ontologies at
once]{.underline}**. **[It is at the heart of the \"ontological
illusions\"]{.underline}** [that course through our social world,
and]{.underline} it is **[at the heart]{.underline}**, as well, **[of
the forms of primitive accumulation that set in place the state-form and
the ascriptions of citizenship]{.underline}**. Thinking alongside
Bhandar and Coulthard, we see more clearly now the ways in which
\"[so-called primitive accumulation\" - the narrative logics and
conceptual forms that accompany transitional phases of
capitalism]{.underline} - take the form of an **[origin-brink
figuration: the removing, or wrenching of temporality from spatiality
and from history]{.underline}**.83 [This figural annihilation of space
by time, this origin narrative - one that]{.underline} **[gets
reiterated in the ontological turn - brings together the temporal
accelerations of financialization with the speculative settler-forms and
speculation as a form of possession and racialized self-possession that
together mark a contemporary moment of primitive
accumulation.]{.underline}** In closing this section, I want to return
to the question of wasteland rationale to make a somewhat speculative
suggestion of my own: that [we understand the discourse of
molecularization as a kind of **abstract dispossession**]{.underline} -
or **[making-waste of the body]{.underline}** - that is the condition of
a **[fantasized speculative self-possession]{.underline}**. In both
[Thacker and Preciado\'s citations]{.underline} throughout, that is to
say, [we see a two-fold movement: the assertion of the body as the new
ground of resource extraction and laying-waste of
capitalism;]{.underline} **[and a speculative re-possession of that
body]{.underline}** ([the hailing of the molecular as the future of
political agency)]{.underline} **[on the condition of that body\'s
dispossession.]{.underline}** [What I have described as the ancestral
future-casting of molecular agency, in other words, follows the abstract
logic of the property form]{.underline} Bhandar lays out: [when the
social, historical contexts are elided from of our understanding of what
embodiment is]{.underline} - [of what molecules \"are\" or appear to
be]{.underline} - then [those molecules become the occasion for an
anticipation,]{.underline} an **[affect of possession and agency that
recalls the abstractions (and, indeed, the racial ontologies) at the
heart of the property-form]{.underline}**.84

#### Cybernetics is not radical or new -- their belief that it functions as a new stage of capitalism masks settler colonialism.

[Recently,]{.underline} [work]{.underline} that shapes itself within the
Spinozist tradition31 [makes recourse to the fields of molecular biology
and chemistry as representative of the \"self-organizing capacity of
inorganic systems]{.underline}.\"32 It appears to some as if the
molecular-biological present is a realization of Spinoza\'s materialism.
Beatriz **[Preciado]{.underline}**, for example, [has recently argued
that the capacity to produce \"molecular joy\" - the \"potential
gaudendi\"]{.underline} (or, \"orgasmic potential\") [of the body -
represents the \"raw material\"]{.underline} of what the Italian
autonomists refer to as [\"cognitive capitalism\": \"the biomolecular
and organic structure of the body,\" Preciado asserts, \"is the last
hiding place of these biopolitical systems of control]{.underline}. This
moment contains all the horror and exaltation of the body\'s political
potential.\"33 [While Preciado\'s interventions are engaging and
vital]{.underline} - and the history of the industrial production of
testosterone that she charts is invaluable - [there is a certain
(reductive) economism to this argument,]{.underline} one we might not
recognize immediately but [that requires our attention.]{.underline}
Mark the logic of the claims, particuarly the assertion [that the
molecular is a new frontier of raw material
extraction/exploitation]{.underline} so significant as to shape the
world-system: \"the world economy is dependent on the production and
circulation of hundreds of tons of synthetic steroids and technically
transformed organs, fluids, cells (techno-blood, techno-sperm,
techno-ovum, etc.).\"34 I think that [Preciado\'s insistence about the
epochal centrality of the molecular to the \"world economy\" might be
debatable.]{.underline} [As]{.underline} Kaushik Sunder [Rajan has
argued extensively, biocapital in itself]{.underline} **[does not mark a
distinct phase of capitalist production]{.underline}**: \"I wish to
clarify the relationship of biocapital to capital (and to capitalisms)
in precisely these terms. **[Biocapital does not signify a distinct
epochal phase of capitalism]{.underline}** [that leaves behind or
radically ruptures capitalism as we have known it]{.underline}.\"35 [The
reason why biocapital]{.underline}, in itself, [does not represent a
critical new phase of capitalism is both that]{.underline} **[capitalism
is \"not a unitary category,\"]{.underline}** [and that \"biocapital
itself]{.underline} **[takes shape in incongruent fashion across the
multiple sites of its global emergence]{.underline}**.\"36
**[Preciado\'s]{.underline}** \"[world economy,\" in other words-not to
mention the figure of \"biotechnology\" itself]{.underline} -
p**[resents a figment of coherence that is illegible outside of the
uneven spatial contexts of production, extraction, circulation and
consumption at work in the constitution of
biocapital-as-value.]{.underline}** As Sunder Rajan explains: \"[The
everyday existence of a biotech or a pharmaceutical company]{.underline}
\... [involves the coexistence of at least these two simultaneous,
distinct, yet mutually constitutive forms of capital]{.underline}.\"37
[Preciado\'s account of what \"the world economy\" \"is,\" however,
focuses largely on circulation and commodity-usage (such as the
testosterone she self-administers). From this vantage point, the
molecular may appear (to Preciado) as both a uniquely \"horrifyingly\"
exploited raw material and an immediately available resource for
resistance]{.underline}. But t[o make such claims runs the risk
of]{.underline} **[blurring the many mediations of labor, spatial
unevenness, and geopolitical contingencies that define the production of
the biotechnology itself: that constitute,]{.underline}** in fact**[,
its social ontology]{.underline}**. The [ontological Being of
testosterone]{.underline}, put another way, **[is not legible from the
point of its consumption,]{.underline}** [even if one claims
that]{.underline}, in taking it, [one is making one\'s own body
available as an exploitable resource and that one is thus in some more
immediate way in relation to the production of biocapitalistic
value]{.underline} (though I think [this tendency of Preciado\'s
argument is also debatable]{.underline}).38 What Sunder [Rajan makes
clear]{.underline} is that **[biotechnology is most legible from the
perspective of its production.]{.underline}**

### L -- Democracy

#### Advocates of democracy as an ideal system fail to recognize the efforts of settled peoples to resist democracy in order to maintain indigenous sovereignty

Sandy **Marie, 2k**, \"American Indian geographies of identity and
power: At the crossroads of Indigena and Mestizaje,\" No Publication,

//nsp

Previous examinations of the potential for critical theory to inform
Indigenous pedagogy (Grande, 1997, 2000) expose significant tensions in
their deep theoretical structures. For instance, [insofar as critical
theorists retain \"democracy\" as the central struggle concept of
liberation, they fail to recognize Indigenous peoples\' historical
battles to resist absorption into the \"democratic imaginary\"4 and
their contemporary struggles to retain tribal sovereignty.]{.underline}
In fact, it **[could]{.underline}** be argued that [the forces of
\"democracy\" have done more to imperil American Indian nations then
they have to sustain them (e.g., the extension of democracy in the form
of civil rights and citizenship has acted as a powerful if not lethal
colonizing force when imposed on the intricate tribal, clan, and kinship
systems of traditional Native communities]{.underline}). Compounding the
tensions between American Indian intellectualism and critical pedagogy
is the fact that American Indian scholars have, by and large, resisted
engagement with critical theory,5 and concentrated instead on the
production of historical monographs, ethnographic studies, tribally
centered curricula, and site-based research. Such a focus stems from the
fact that most American Indian scholars feel compelled to address the
political urgencies of their own communities, against which engagement
in abstract theory appears to be a luxury and privilege of the academic
elite. While I recognize the need for practically based research, I
argue that the everincreasing global encroachment on American Indian
lands, resources, cultures, and communities points to the equally urgent
need to build political coalitions and formulate transcendent theories
of liberation. Moreover, while individual tribal needs are in fact
great, I believe that, unless the boundaries of coalition are expanded
to include non-Indian communities, Indian nations will remain vulnerable
to whims of the existing social order. The combined effect of internal
neglect and external resistance to critical pedagogy has pushed American
Indian intellectualism to the margins of critical discourse. This
reality raises a series of important questions that help form the basis
of this discussion: 1. Insofar as critical theory remains disconnected
from the work of American Indian scholars, how do its language and
epistemic frames serve as homogenizing agents when interfaced with the
conceptual and analytical categories persistent within American Indian
educational history and intellectualism? 2. How has the resistance of
American Indian intellectuals to critical theory contributed to the
general lack of analyses on the impact of racism (and, for that matter,
other \"isms\") within American Indian communities? 3. How have the
marginalization of critical scholarship and the concomitant fascination
with cultural/literary forms of American Indian writing contributed to
the preoccupation with parochial questions of identity and authenticity?
And, how have these obsessions about identity concealed the
social-political realities facing American Indian communities? While the
above questions provide the foundation for a broad discussion of the
intersection of critical theory and American Indian intellectualism, I
submit that the main source of tension is embedded in their competing
notions of identity - one rooted in Western definitions of the civil
society and the other in the traditional structures of tribal society.
In terms of identity, critical theorists aim to explode the concretized
categories of race, class, gender, and sexuality and to claim the
intersections the borderlands - as the space to create a new culture -
una cultures mestiza - in which the only normative standard is hybridity
and all subjects are constructed as inherently transgressive.6 Though
American Indian intellectuals support the notion of hybridity, they
remain skeptical of the new mestiza as a possible continuation of the
colonialist project to fuse Indians into the national model of the
democratic citizen. There is, in other words, an undercurrent to the
postcolonial lexicon of mestizaje that seems to undermine the formation
of \"a comfortable modern American Indian identity\" (Deloria & Lytle,
1984, p. 266). More specifically, I argue that the contemporary
pressures of ethnic fraud, corporate commodification, and culture loss
render the critical notion of \"transgressive\" identity highly
problematic for Indigenous peoples. As such, [the primary argument is
that critical efforts to promote mestizaje as the basis of a new
cultural democracy does not fully consider Indigenous struggles to
sustain the cultural and political integrity of American Indian
communities.]{.underline} That being said, it is important to note that
American Indian critical studies are perceived by both Indigenous and
non-Indigenous scholars as a \"dangerous discourse\" equally threatening
to the fields of critical pedagogy and American Indian intellectualism.7
After all, American Indian critical studies would compel \"Whitestream\"
advocates of critical theory to ask how their knowledge and practices
may have contributed and remained blind to the continued exploitation of
Indigenous peoples. Specifically, it would require a deeper recognition
that [these are not postcolonial times]{.underline}, that
[\"globalization\" is simply the new metaphor for
imperialism,]{.underline} and that [current constructions of democracy
continue to presume the eventual absorption of Indigenous
peoples]{.underline}. For American Indian intellectuals, the infusion of
critical studies would require a movement away from the safety of
unified, essentialized, and idealized constructions of American
Indianness toward more complicated readings of American Indian
formations of power and identity, particularly those that take into
account the existence of internal oppression. Specifically, it would
compel American Indian intellectuals to confront the taboo subjects of
racism, sexism, and homophobia within American Indian communities.
Ultimately, however, this article is not a call for American Indian
scholars to simply join the conversation of critical theorists. Rather,
it is an initiation of an Indigenous conversation that can, in turn,
engage in dialectical contestation with the dominant modes of critical
theory. In this way, I hope that the development of an Indigenous theory
of liberation can itself be a politically transformative practice, one
that works to transgress tribal divisions and move toward the
development of transcendent theory of American Indian sovereignty and
self-determination. With this in mind, my discussion of the central
tension between critical pedagogy and American Indian intellectualism
unfolds in four parts. Part one examines formations of identity that
have emerged from the dominant modes of critical discourse, paying
special attention to the notion of transgression, and the construction
of mestizaje as a counter-discourse of subjectivity. Part two examines
American Indian formations of identity and the external forces that work
to threaten these formations, namely ethnic fraud, cultural
encroachment, corporate commodification, and culture loss. Part three
examines the intersection between American Indian identity and
mestizaje, as well as other models of hybridity generated by American
Indian and other scholars of color. The article concludes with a call
for the development of a new Red Pedagogy,8 or one that is historically
grounded in American Indian intellectualism, politically centered in
issues of sovereignty and tribal self-determination, and inspired by the
religious and spiritual9 traditions of American Indian peoples. Part I.
Identity, Subjectivity and Critical Theory: Mestizaje and the New
Cultural Democracy \"Critical pedagogy is the term used to describe what
emerges when critical theory encounters education\" (Kincheloe &
Steinberg, 1997, p. 24). Rather than offer prescriptions, critical
pedagogy draws from the structural critique of critical theory,
extending an analysis of school as a site of reproduction, resistance,
and social transformation. It examines the ways that power and
domination inform the processes and procedures of schooling and works to
expose the sorting and selecting functions of the institution. As it has
evolved into its current form(s), critical pedagogy has emerged as both
a rhetoric and a social movement. Critical educators continue to
advocate an increasingly sophisticated critique of the social, economic,
and political barriers to social justice, as well as to crusade for the
transformation of schools to reflect the imperatives of democracy.
Critical scholars have, over time, provided a sustained critique of the
forces of power and domination and their relation to the pedagogical
(Kincheloe & Steinberg, 1997). As defined here, \"the pedagogical\"
refers to the production of identity or the way one learns to see
oneself in relation to the world. Identity is thus situated as one of
the core struggle concepts of critical pedagogy, where the formation of
self serves as the basis for analyses of race, class, gender, and
sexuality and their relationship to the questions of democracy, justice,
and community. By positioning identity in the foreground of their
theories, critical scholars have fueled as many theories of identity as
they have varieties of critical pedagogy. While there are differences
between and among these formulations, critical constructions of identity
are distinct from both liberal and conservative theories of identity.
Such theories are viewed as problematic by critical scholars because of
their use of \"essentialist\" or reductionistic analyses of difference
(Kinchloe & Steinberg, 1997; McCarthy & Crichlow, 1993; McLaren, 1997).
\"Essentialist\" analysis refers to the treatment of racial and social
groups as if they were stable and homogeneous entities, or as if members
of each group possessed \"some innate and invariant set of
characteristics setting them apart from each other and from \`Whites\"\'
(McCarthy & Crichlow, 1993, p. xviii). Critical scholars argue that
essentialism not only undertheorizes race but can also result in a gross
misreading of the nature of difference, opening the door for the
proliferation of deeply cynical theories of racial superiority, such as
Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray\'s The Bell Curve (1994). While
conservatives typically invoke essentialist theories, critical scholars
acknowledge that some forms of left-essentialism operate in the
contemporary landscape to similarly divisive ends.10 In response to the
undertheorizing of race by both the Left and the Right, critical
[theorists advocate]{.underline} a theory of difference that is firmly
rooted in the \"[power-sensitive discourses of]{.underline} power,
[democracy, social justice and historical memory]{.underline}\" (McLaren
& Giroux, 1997, p. 17). In so doing, [they replace the comparatively
static notion of identity as a relatively fixed entity that one embodies
with the more fluid concept of subjectivity]{.underline} - an entity
that one actively and continually constructs. Subjectivity works to
underscore the contingency of identity and the understanding that
\"[individuals consist of a decentered flux of subject positions highly
dependent on discourse, social structure, repetition, memory, and
affective investment]{.underline}\" (McLaren & Giroux, 1997, p. 25). In
other words, [one\'s \"identity\" is historically situated and socially
constructed, rather than predetermined by biological or other prima
facie indicators.]{.underline} In addition to calling attention to the
relational aspects of identity, the critical notion of subjectivity
advances a more complex analysis of cultural and racial identity. It
shifts race from a passive product of biological endowment to an active
\"product of human work\" (Said, 1993, p. xix). Critical scholars argue
that the rupture of previously rigid racial categories reveals contested
spaces or borderlands where cultures collide, creating the space to
explore new notions of identity in the resulting contradictions,
nuances, and discontinuities they introduce into the terrain of racial
identity. Thus, where essentialist scholars examine race, class, gender,
and sexuality as discrete categories, critical scholars focus on the
spaces of intersection between and among these categories. The emergence
of subjectivity as a socially constructed entity spawned a whole new
language about identity. Border cultures, border-crossers, mestiza
(Anzaldua, 1987; Delgado Bernal, 1998); Xicanisma (Castillo, 1995);
postcolonial hybridities, cyborg identities (Harraway, 1991); and
mestizaje (Darder, Torres, & Gutierrez, 1997; McLaren & Sleeter, 1995;
Valle & Torres, 1995) are just some of the emergent concepts formulated
to explain and bring language to the experience of multiplicity,
relationality, and transgression as they relate to identity. Moreover,
critical scholars contend that the development of transgressive
subjectivity not only works to resist essentialist constructions of
identity but also acts to counter the hegemonic notion of Whiteness as
the normative standard for all subjects. Such efforts represent the hope
and possibility of critical pedagogy as they seek to construct a
critical democracy that includes multiple cultures, languages, and
voices. Critical pedagogy thus serves both to challenge the existing
sociocultural and economic relations of exploitation and to strengthen
collective work toward peace and social justice, thereby creating a more
equitable democratic order and, by definition, more equitable
educational institutions. From Mestizaje to Mestiza back to Mestizaje
The critical notion of mestizaje (Darder, Torres, & Gutierrez, 1997;
McLaren & Sleeter, 1995; Kinchloe & Steinberg, 1997; Valle & Torres,
1995) is arguably among the most widely embraced models of
multisubjectivity. Historically speaking, the counterdiscourse of
mestizaje is rooted in the Latin American subjectivity of the mestizo -
literally, a person of mixed ancestry, especially of American Indian,
European, and African backgrounds (Delgado Bernal, 1998). Mestizaje is
the Latin American term for cultural ambiguity, representative of \"the
continent\'s unfinished business of cultural hybridization\" (Valle &
Torres, 1995, p. 141). With regard to this history, Latin American
scholars Victor Valle and Rodolfo Torres write: In Latin America the
genetic and cultural dialogue between the descendants of Europe, Africa,
Asia, and the hemisphere\'s indigenous populations has been expressed in
discourses reflecting and responding to a host of concrete national
circumstances. In some cases, mestizaje has risen to the level of a
truly critical counter-discourse of revolutionary aspirations, while at
other times it has been co-opted by the state. (p. 141) Thus, it could
be argued that the political project of mestizaje originated in Latin
America, where the cluster of Spanish, Indian, and Afro-Caribbean
peoples were ostensibly \"fused\" through the violence of genocide into
the national model of the mestizo. In the northern hemisphere, Chicana
scholar Gloria Anzaldua\'s seminal text Borderlands, la Frontera: The
New Mestiza (1987) reinscribed the cultural terrain with the language
and embodiment of mestiza consciousness. Since the book\'s publication,
mestiza has come to embody a new feminist Chicana consciousness that
\"straddles cultures, races, languages, nations, sexualities, and
spiritualities\" and the experience of \"living with ambivalence while
balancing opposing powers\" (Delgado Bernal, 1998, p. 561). Anzaldua
(1987) states, \"The new mestiza copes by developing a tolerance for
contradictions, a tolerance for ambiguity. She learns to be an Indian in
Mexican culture \[and\] to be Mexican from an Anglo point of view\" (p.
79). From this base, a variety of Chicana and other border feminisms
have emerged, centered on the social histories and epistemologies of
women of color. More recently, the intellectual left, particularly
critical scholars, has incorporated the spirit of the Chicana mestiza in
its own search for a viable model of subjectivity. It embraces the
emergent discourse of mestizaje and its emphasis on the way in which all
cultures change in relation to one another as the postcolonial antidote
to imperialist notions of racial purity (di Leonardo, 1991). This
radically inclusive construct \"willfully blurs political, racial,
\[and\] cultural borders in order to better adapt to the world as it is
actually constructed\" (Valle & Torres, 1995, p. 149) and embodies the
mestizo\'s demonstrated refusal to prefer one language, one national
heritage, or one culture at the expense of others. Leading critical
scholar Peter McLaren (1997) summarily articulates mestizaje as \"the
embodiment of a transcultural, transnational subject, a self-reflexive
entity capable of rupturing the facile legitimization of \'authentic\'
national identities through \[the\] articulation of a subject who is
conjunctural, who is a relational part of an ongoing negotiated
connection to the larger society, and who is interpolated by multiple
subject positionings\" (p. 12). In other words, mestizaje crosses all
imposed cultural, linguistic, and national borders, refusing all
\"natural\" or transcendent claims that \"by definition attempt to
escape from any type of historical and normative grounding\" (McLaren &
Giroux, 1997, p. 117). Ultimately, the critical notion of mestizaje is
itself multifunctional, for it signifies a strategic response to the
decline of the imperial West, facilitates the decentering of Whiteness,
and undermines the myth of the democratic nation-state based on borders
and exclusions (Valle & Torres, 1995). Insofar as the notion of
mestizaje disrupts the discourse of jingoistic nationalism, it is indeed
crucial to the project of liberation. As McLaren notes, \"Educators
would do well to consider Gloria Anzaldua\'s (1987) project of creating
mestizaje theories that create new categories of identity for those left
out or pushed out of existing ones\" (McLaren, 1997, p. 537). In so
doing, however, \"care must be taken not to equate hybridity with
equality\" (McLaren, 1997, p. 46).11 As Coco Fusco notes, \"The
postcolonial celebration of hybridity has (too often) been interpreted
as the sign that no further concern about the politics of representation
and cultural exchange is needed. With ease, we lapse back into the
integrationist rhetoric of the 1960\'s\" (Fusco, 1995, p. 46). These
words caution us not to lose sight - in the wake of transgressing
borders and building postnational coalitions - of the unique challenges
presented to particular groups in their distinct struggles for social
justice. In taking this admonition seriously, the following discussion
moves into an examination of American Indian tribal identity and some of
the current pressures facing Indian communities that, I argue, render
the notion of mestizaje somewhat problematic. The question remains
whether the construction of a transgressive subjectivity - mestizaje -
can be reconciled with the pressures of identity appropriation, cultural
commodification, culture loss, and, perhaps more importantly, with
Indigenous imperatives of self-determination and sovereignty. Part II.
The Formation of Indigena: American Indian Geographies of Power and
Identity [Whitestream America has never really understood what it means
to be Indian and even less about what it means to be tribal. Such
ignorance has deep historical roots and wide political implications of
not understanding what it means to be tribal, since the U.S. government
determined long ago that to be \"tribal\" runs deeply counter to the
notion of democracy and the proliferation of (individual) civil rights.
Throughout the centuries, uncompromising belief in this tenet of
democratic order provided the ideological foundation for numerous
expurgatory campaigns against Indigenous peoples.]{.underline} [The
Civilization Act of 1819, the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the Dawes
Allotment Act of 1886, the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, the Indian
Reorganization Act of 1934, and the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968

### L -- Dependency

#### Positioning other countries as "dependent" on the US' aid reinforces settler colonial hierarchies and imperialism under the guise of rationality

discourse: A postcolonial critique. Critical Perspectives on

[Postcolonialism has provided a trenchant critique of colonialism,
neo-colonialism and imperialism and its critical practice is now being
applied to globalisation and its effects]{.underline}, interpreted by
some as a contemporary manifestation of the imperialist impulse. Indeed,
for Said [colonialism was just one manifestation of the West's
imperialist project]{.underline} (Parry, 1997). Parry, (1997, p. 227),
whilst recognising different manifestations of imperialism, notes [the
contemporary form of "industrial-military interventions and aggressive
investment programmes implemented by the expansionist social orders of
western nation-states]{.underline}". However, [she also recognises that
imperialism no longer requires military intervention or form of
occupation,]{.underline} **[but is constituted by the construction of
dependencies of the sort the US has most prodigiously
pursued.]{.underline}** [Imperialism]{.underline} [is "the radically
altered forms of capitalism's accelerated penetration into the
noncapitalist world"]{.underline} (Parry, 1997, p. 228) cre[ating an
unbalanced and asymmetrical new world order under western
hegemony]{.underline}. Other commentators also see modern capitalism and
[globalisation as a form of imperialism imposing a new spatial and
temporal order on the world]{.underline}, **[but masking the imperialist
impulse with rhetoric of rationality and modernisation]{.underline}**
(Harvey, 1989; Soja, 1989). Clearly, international business is central
to the globalisation process and its effects. Thus [postcolonialism
offers a critique of globalisation that abuts directly with the concerns
of the IBMS discourse. It is a critical practice that orthodox IBMS with
its functionalist and managerialist inclinations has not engaged with as
yet to any marked degree]{.underline} (exceptions include Banerjee and
Linstead, 2001; Chakravartty, 2004; Mirchandani, 2004; Prasad, 1997).

### L -- Ethics

#### Native and black genocide is the foundation of modernity and set the state for [\[inert aff\]]{.mark} to occur -- the aff is a false sense of morality which flourishes through distancing itself from gratuitous violence of the native

**Wilderson 10** Frank B, Prof of African American studies and drama @
UC Irvine \["Red White and Black: Cinema and the Structure of U.S
Antagonisms"\]//Recut Mberhe

Again, if accumulation and fungibility are the modalities through which
Blackness is positioned as incapacity, then **[genocide is that modality
through which embodied Redness is positioned as
incapacity.]{.underline}** [Ontological incapacity, I have inferred and
here state forthright, is the constituent element of
ethics.]{.underline} Put another way, one cannot embody capacity and be,
simultaneously, ethical. Where there are Slaves it is unethical to be
free. The Settler/Master's capacity, I have argued, is a function of
exploitation and alienation, and the Slave's incapacity is elaborated by
accumulation and fungibility. [But the "Savage" is positioned,
structurally, by subjective capacity and objective incapacity, by
sovereignty and genocide, respectively. The Indian's liminal status in
political economy, how her and his position shuttles between the
incapacity of a genocidedobject and the capacity of a sovereign
subject]{.underline}, coupled with the fact that Redness does not
overdetermine the thanatology of libidinal economy (this liminal
capacity within political economy and complete freedom from incapacity
within libidinal economy) raises serious doubts about the status of
"Savage" ethicality vis-à-vis the triangulated structure (Red, White,
and Black) of antagonisms. Clearly, **[the coherence of Whiteness as a
structural position in modernity depends on the capacity to be free from
genocide, perhaps not as a historical experience, but at least as a
positioning modality.]{.underline}** This embodied capacity (genocidal
immunity) of Whiteness jettisons the White/Red relation from that of a
conflict and marks it as an antagonism: it stains it with
irreconcilability. Here, the Indian comes into being and is positioned
by an a priori violence of genocide. Whiteness can also experience this
kind of violence but only *a fortiori*: genocide may be one of a
thousand contingent experiences of Whiteness but it is not a constituent
element, it does not make Whites white (or Humans human). **[Whiteness
can grasp its own capacity, be present to itself, coherent, by its
unavailability to the a priori violence of Red genocide, as well as by
its unavailability to the a priori violence of Black accumulation and
fungibility. If it experiences accumulation and fungibility, or
genocide, those experiences must be named, qualified, that is, "White
slavery," or the Armenian massacre, the Jewish Holocaust, Bosnian
interment, so that such contingent experience is not confused with
ontological necessity.]{.underline}** In such a position one can always
say, "Im not a 'Savage'" or "I'm being treated like a nigger." One can
assert one's Humanity by refusing the ruse of analogy. Regardless of
Whites' historical, and brief, encounters with the modalities of the
"Savage" and the Slave, these modalities do not break in on the position
of Whiteness with such a force as to replace exploitation and alienation
as the Settler/Master's constituent elements. We might think of
exploitation and alienation as modalities of suffering which inoculate
Whiteness from death. If this is indeed the case, then perhaps
[Whiteness has no constituent elements other than the immanent status of
immunity. Still, this immunity is no small matter, for it is the sine
qua non of Human capacity.]{.underline}

#### Genocide destroys the possibility of value -- the K is a pre requisite to the aff

**Wilderson 10** Frank B, Prof of African American studies and drama @
UC Irvine \["Red White and Black: Cinema and the Structure of U.S
Antagonisms"\]//Mberhe

**[Again, in the United States, the "Savage" equals 1.6% of the
population and the Settler equals 80.6%. Since contact, genocide has
reversed the "Savage" to Settler ratio with nearly perfect
symmetry.]{.underline}** Herein lies the Manicheism of the
Settler/"Savage" antagonism, a Manicheism manifest far more emphatically
in America than in Canada. In the US, the symbiosis between the material
production of living zones (scaled upward from White bodies to civil
society) and dead zones (scaled upward from Red flesh to the
Reservation) is so pervasive that [one need not belong to a specific
tribe which has directly experienced the events of genocide in order for
one's own indigenism to be underwritten by the historical trauma of
genocide.]{.underline} (Like "Savage" ontologists from Hawaii or Canada,
Saidiya Hartman makes a similar case with respect to the Slave: She
argues, explicitly, that the spatial condition of chattel slavery is not
bound by the borders of the plantation, but also territorializes the
world of Blacks in the north. And she argues, implicitly, that the
[temporal condition of chattel slavery did not end in 1865 but followed
generations of Blacks one hundred and fifty years into the
future]{.underline} \[Scenes of Subjection... 25\].)

### L -- Extinction 

#### Rhetoric of extinction in western spaces is a tool used to offer pleasure to those in the western world -- it normalizes images of violence that allows replication of indigenous genocide 

Audra **Mitchell 17**, Wilfrid Laurier professor, 9-27-2017,
"Decolonizing against extinction part II: Extinction is not a metaphor
-- it is literally genocide,"
<https://worldlyir.wordpress.com/2017/09/27/decolonizing-against-extinction-part-ii-extinction-is-not-a-metaphor-it-is-literally-genocide/>
// nsp

[Extinction has become an emblem of]{.underline} Western, and
[white-dominated, fears about 'the end of the(ir) world']{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} scientific [term is saturated with emotional
potency]{.underline}, stretched and [contorted to embody]{.underline}
almost any nightmare, from climate change to asteroid strikes. In
academic and public contexts alike, it is regularly interchanged with
other terms and concepts -- for instance, 'species death', global
warming or ecological collapse. Diffused into sublime scales -- mass
extinctions measured in millions of (Gregorian calendar) years, a planet
totalized by the threat of nuclear destruction -- '[extinction' has
become an empty superlative, one that that gestures to an abstract form
of unthinkability]{.underline}. [It teases Western subjects with images
of]{.underline} generalized [demise that might]{.underline}, if it gets
bad enough, even [threaten]{.underline} us, or [the figure of 'humanity'
that we enshrine as a universal. This figure of 'humanity', derived from
Western European enlightenment ideals, emphasizes individual, autonomous
actors who are fully integrated into the global market
system;]{.underline} [who are]{.underline} responsible [citizens of
nation-states; who conform to Western ideas of health and well-being;
who partake of 'culture'; who participate in democratic state-based
politics; who refrain from physical violence; and who manage their
'resources' responsibly]{.underline} (Mitchell 2014). Oddly, [exposure
to the fear of extinction contributes to the formation and bolstering of
contemporary Western subjects.]{.underline} [Contemplating
the]{.underline} sublime [destruction of 'humanity' offers]{.underline}
the thrill of abjection: the [perverse pleasure derived from exposure to
something by which one is revolted]{.underline}. Claire Colebrook
detects this thrill-seeking impulse in the profusion of Western
blockbuster films and TV shows that imagine and envision the destruction
of earth, or at least of 'humanity'. It also throbs through a flurry of
recent best-selling books -- both fiction and speculative non-fiction
(see Oreskes and Conway 2014; Newitz 2013; Weisman 2008). In a
forthcoming intervention, Noah Theriault and I (2018) argue that [these
imaginaries are a form of porn that normalizes the profound violences
driving extinction, while cocooning its viewers in the secure space of
the voyeur]{.underline}. Certainly, there are many Western scientists,
conservationists and policy-makers who are genuinely committed to
stopping the extinction of others, perhaps out of fear for their own
futures. Yet [extinction is not quite real for Western, and especially
white, subjects; it is a fantasy of negation that evokes thrill,
particular]{.underline} [melancholy, anger and existential
purpose]{.underline}. It is a metaphor that expresses the destructive
desires of these beings, and the negativity against which we define our
subjectivity. But [extinction]{.underline} is not a metaphor: it [is a
very real expression of violence that systematically destroys
beings]{.underline}, worlds, life forms and the relations that enable
them to flourish. These are real, unique beings, worlds and relations --
as well as somebody's family, Ancestors, siblings, future generations --
who are violently destroyed. Extinction can only be used unironically as
a metaphor by people who have never been threatened with it, told it is
their inevitable fate, or lost their relatives and Ancestors to it --
and who assume that they probably never will. This argument is directly
inspired by the call to arms issued in 2012 by Eve Tuck and Wayne K.
Yang and more recently by Cutcha Risling-Baldy. The first, seminal piece
demonstrates how [settler cultures use the violence of metaphorical
abstraction to excuse themselves from the real work of
decolonization]{.underline}: ensuring that land and power is in
Indigenous hands. Risling-Baldy's brilliant follow-up extends this logic
to explain how First People like Coyote have been reduced to metaphors
through settler appropriation. In both cases, engagement with Indigenous
peoples and their relations masks moves to innocence: [acts]{.underline}
that [make it appear as if settlers are engaging in decolonization,
while in fact we are consolidating the power structures that privilege
us.]{.underline} In this series, want to show how [Western]{.underline},
and white-dominated, [discourses on 'extinction' appear to address
the]{.underline} [systematic destruction of peoples and other beings
while enacting moves to innocence that mask their culpability and
perpetuate structures of violence.]{.underline} As I argued in Part I of
this series, [extinction is an expression of colonial
violence.]{.underline} As such, it needs to be addressed through direct
decolonization, including the dismantling of settler colonial structures
of violence, and the resurgence of Indigenous worlds. Following Tuck,
Yang and Risling-Baldy's lead, I want to show how and why the violences
that drive extinction have come to be invisible within mainstream
discourses. Salient amongst these is the practice of genocide against
Indigenous peoples other than humans. ...it is literally genocide. [What
Western science calls 'extinction' is]{.underline} not an unfortunate,
unintended consequence of desirable 'human' activities. It is [an
embodiment of particular patterns of structural violence that
disproportionately affect specific racialized groups.]{.underline} In
some cases, ['extinction' is directly, deliberately and systematically
inflicted in order to create space for aggressors, including settler
states.]{.underline} For this reason, it has rightly been framed as an
aspect or tool of colonial genocides against Indigenous human peoples.
Indeed, many theorists have shown that the 'extirpation' of life forms
(their total removal from a particular place) is an instrument for
enacting genocide upon Indigenous humans (see Mazis 2008; Laduke 1999;
Stannard 1994). Specifically, the removal of key sources of food,
clothing and other basic materials makes survival on the land impossible
for the people targeted. Nehiyaw thinker Tasha Hubbard (2014) makes a
qualitatively distinct argument. She points out that the Buffalo are
First People, the elder brothers of the Nehiyaw people (and other
Indigenous nations -- see Benton-Banai 2010). Starting in the mid-1800s,
the tens of millions of buffalo that ranged across Turtle Island were
nearly eliminated through strategic patterns of killing carried out by
settler-state-sponsored military and commercial forces. Their killing
was linked to governmental imperatives to clear and territorially annex
the Great Plains by removing its Indigenous peoples. As Hubbard points
out, methods of destroying buffalo herds included large-scale killing,
but also the disruption of their social structures, the destruction of
the ecosystems on which they rely, and the removal of calves. These acts
involve each of the components of the definition of genocide enshrined
in the UN Genocide Convention: (a) Killing members of the group; (b)
Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c)
Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to
bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) Imposing
measures intended to prevent births within the group; (e) Forcibly
transferring children of the group to another group. [From Hubbard's
viewpoint]{.underline}, [rooted in]{.underline} Nehiyaw philosophy and
[ethical-legal principles, the systematic destruction of the buffalo is
not like genocide, nor is it exclusively a tool for carrying out
genocide against human peoples. It is genocide in its own right: an
attempt to destroy a particular First People and the possibilities of
its continuity.]{.underline} In other words, [the deliberate and
systematic attempt to eliminate the buffalo, enacted by settler states,
simultaneously enacted genocide against Indigenous peoples and their
nonhuman relatives]{.underline}. [Genocides of Indigenous
peoples]{.underline} (human and otherwise) [continue]{.underline} apace
[in contemporary settler states, transformed into multiple
manifestations]{.underline}. For instance, they are integral to
'biosecurity' strategies designed to police the biological boundaries of
these states and their citizens. Laced with racializing and xenophobic
rhetoric (Subramaniam 2001), [strategies such as culling or planned
eradications are intended to remove 'invasive' or 'foreign' life forms
in order to protect 'Native' ones]{.underline}. Many of the 'invasive'
life forms targeted for destruction were transported to unfamiliar lands
through colonial patterns of settlement and global trade flows. However,
[this]{.underline} [logic of elimination]{.underline} (Wolfe 2006) [is
often perverted, turned against Indigenous]{.underline}\* [beings whose
flourishing impedes the expansion or consolidation of the colonial
state]{.underline}. For instance, Deborah Bird Rose (2011 a, 2011 b)
shows how this form of violence is continually waged against flying
foxes, who are framed by the settler state as "pest\[s\] whose
extinction is \[deliberately\] sought". This act of elimination involves
explicit genocidal ideation, or the imagination of the destruction of a
people. Rose characterizes it as a "matter of imagining a world without
\[dingoes or flying foxes\], then setting out to create it" (Rose
2011a). The Australian settler state has used multiple tactics to induce
terror and preclude flourishing amongst flying foxes, from the emission
of high-pitched electronic signals to smearing trees with python
excrement (Rose 2011b). Indeed, in 2014, I lived near to the roosting
site of a group of flying foxes in Turrbal and Jagera Country (suburban
Brisbane to settlers). Such nesting places are called 'colonies' ,
reflecting a Western scientific rhetoric that frames Indigenous peoples
as 'invaders' of the settler state. The trees that housed the nesting
site backed onto a municipal facility, whose fence had been covered with
barbed wire, in which many of the bats snared their wings and starved to
death. [This 'security' measure]{.underline} -- designed to protect the
facilities relied upon by urban settlers from the intrusion of flying
foxes -- [is a powerful weapon for precluding ongoing flourishing of
Indigenous]{.underline} other-than-human [peoples]{.underline}. I
learned from neighbours that this 'colony' had previously been 'moved'
from several other sites around the city, suffering significant declines
in population each time. Indeed, despite reported declines of 95% in
flying fox communities in Queensland and neighbouring New South Wales,
the Queensland settler state legalized the shooting of the bats in 2012
by fruitgrowers. Of course, in some cases, the elimination of life forms
is not as targeted or intentional -- it may take the form of land-based
extractive violence, the creep of ocean acidification, the decimation of
rainforests by climate change. Proponents of a Eurocentric definition of
genocide could argue that these events lack intention. Indeed, within
international law, intention to commit genocide is a necessary criteria
for conviction. However, theorists of critical genocide studies have
long argued that this definition is inadequate: it brackets out a great
many of the acts, logics and structures that produce the destruction of
unique peoples. According to Tony Barta, definitions of genocide that
focus on 'purposeful annihilation', and in particular on physical
killing, have "devalu\[ed\] all other concepts of less planned
destruction, even if the effects are the same" (Barta 2000, 238). For
this reason, he shifts the focus from 'genocidal intention' to
'genocidal outcome' -- that is, from the abstract assignation of
genocidal agency to the felt and embodied effects of eliminative
violence. It is the focus on intent, he contends, that allows white
Australians to imagine that their relationship with Aboriginal people is
non-genocidal despite overwhelming evidence of systematic and deliberate
racialized destruction over several centuries. In contrast, an approach
based on 'genocidal outcomes' makes it possible to account for complex
causality and weak intentionality -- that is, for myriad acts mediated
by subtle, normalized structures that, together, work to eliminate a
people. I want to argue that the same logic applies to nonhuman peoples:
the destruction of a life form, its relations with other beings and its
possible futures is a genocidal outcome, whether or not intention can be
identified. Similarly, Christopher Powell (2007) argues that, since a
'genos' is a "network of practical social relations, destruction of a
genos means the forcible breaking down of those relationships...these
effects could be produced without a coherent intent to destroy. They
could result from sporadic and uncoordinated actions whose underlying
connection is the production of a new society in which there is simply
no room for the genos in question to exist. They might even result from
well-meaning attempts to do good" (Powell 2007, 538) As I have argued
elsewhere, extinction is defined by the breaking of relations and the
systematic destruction of the conditions of plurality that nurture
co-flourishing worlds. Whether inflicted out as a deliberate act of
extirpation, or as the convergent effect of eliminative logics expressed
over centuries and enormous spatial scales[, extinction is the
destruction of relations and the heterogenous societies they nurture.
Understood in this way, 'extinction' is not a metaphor for genocide or
other forms of large-scale violence: it is a distinct manifestation of
genocide.]{.underline} Masking the genocidal logics that drive
extinction involves several moves to innocence (Tuck and Yang 2012).
Treating extinction as something short of genocide entrenches
Eurocentric understandings of personhood that are limited to homo
sapiens, which is itself an act of violence against these peoples.
Ironically, the entrenchment of this dichotomy also enables the logic of
'dehumanization', in which human communities are likened to reviled
nonhumans (for instance, cockroaches) in order to motivate violence
against them. As I have argued elsewhere (Mitchell 2014), the logic of
generalised 'dehumanisation' is uniquely effective in Western frameworks
in which the lack of ethical status for beings other than humans removes
obstacles to their mass destruction. Within worlds in which human and
nonhuman persons are linked through complex systems of law, treaties,
protocols and long-standing relations, this claim is illogical. Within
Western settler states, however, it functions as a means of justifying
ongoing violence against Indigenous peoples and their relations. In
addition, by framing extinction as a problem for a universal figure of
'humanity' (more on this to follow...) mainstream discourses of
extinction obscure its profound entwinement with race and racializing
structures. These examples make it clear that [eliminative violence is
targeted on specific groups of people and their]{.underline}
other-than-human [relations]{.underline}, as defined by the aggressors.
Indeed, [patterns of genocidal violence extend racializing categories,
hierarchies and eliminative impulses to other-than-human
peoples]{.underline}. Just as approaching gender violence separately
from race effaces their intersection, understanding extinction as
distinct from race is deeply misleading. This is not only because
[racialized people are more likely to suffer from the effects of
'extinction' and other forms of environmental racism]{.underline} (which
they are). It is also because the [eliminative violence]{.underline}
that [drives extinction]{.underline} extend and enact race beyond the
category of homo sapiens by defining particular groups against white
settler norms and as threats to the settler society. To approach
extinction separately from issues of race is, therefore, to miss one of
its most defining features. Extinction is not a metaphor -- in many
cases, it is quite literally genocide enacted against Indigenous peoples
and their other-than-human relations. To treat it as a metaphor is to
obscure and participate in the structures of violence that drive it.
From this perspective, in addition to active decolonisation efforts, and
the resurgence of Indigenous peoples, addressing extinction also
requires attacking the genocidal, racializing, eliminative logics that
are diffused throughout settler (and other) states. It also requires
honouring the unique relations, worlds and peoples that are targeted by
these discourses and practices.

#### Reject their biological extinction focused politics -- it functions by parasitically absorbing settlers' actual extinction of natives and filtering it into their own fear of the end of Western civilization

**Dalley, Assistant Professor of English at Daemish College, 16**

(Hamish, research falls within the subfield usually called "postcolonial
studies," which focuses on the legacy of European imperialism in places
like Australia, India, and West Africa. I have written about how authors
use fiction to re-examine the colonial frontier and challenge myths of
white superiority, "The deaths of settler colonialism: extinction as a
metaphor of decolonization in contemporary settler literature", *Settler
Colonial Studies*, October 4^th^, 2016, pg. 1-17,)

[Settlers love to contemplate the possibility of their own
extinction]{.underline}; to read many contemporary literary
representations of settler colonialism is to find settlers strangely
satisfied in dreaming of ends that never come. This tendency is widely
prevalent in English-language representations of settler colonialism
produced since the 1980s: the possibility of an ending -- [the
likelihood that the settler race will one day die out -- is a common
theme in literary and pop culture considerations of colonialism's
future]{.underline}. Yet it has barely been remarked how surprising it
is that this theme is so present. For settlers, of all people, to
obsessively ruminate on their own finitude is counterintuitive, for few
modern social formations have been more resistant to change than settler
colonialism. With a few exceptions (French Algeria being the largest),
the settler societies established in the last 300 years in the Americas,
Australasia, and Southern Africa have all retained the basic features
that define them as settler states -- namely, the structural privileging
of settlers at the expense of indigenous peoples, and the normalization
of whiteness as the marker of political agency and rights -- and they
have done so notwithstanding the sustained resistance that has been
mounted whenever such an order has been built. Settlers think all the
time that they might one day end, even though (perhaps because) that
ending seems unlikely ever to happen. The significance of this paradox
for settler-colonial literature is the subject of this article.
[Considering the problem of futurity offers a useful foil to traditional
analyses of settler-colonial narrative, which typically examine
settlers' attitudes towards history in order to highlight a constitutive
anxiety about the past -- about origins]{.underline}. Settler
colonialism, the argument goes, has a problem with historical narration
that arises from a contradiction in its founding mythology. In Stephen
Turner's formulation, [the settler subject is by definition one who
comes from elsewhere but who strives to make this place home. The
settlement narrative must explain how this gap -- which is at once
geographical, historical, and existential -- has been bridged, and the
settler transformed from outsider into indigene]{.underline}. [Yet the
transformation must remain constitutively incomplete, because the desire
to be at home necessarily invokes the spectre of the native, whose
existence (which cannot be disavowed completely because it is needed to
define the settler's difference, superiority, and hence claim to the
land) inscribes the settler's foreignness, thus reinstating the gap
between settler and colony that the narrative was meant to
efface]{.underline}. Settler-colonial narrative is thus shaped around
its need to erase and evoke the native, to make the indigene both
invisible and present in a contradictory pattern that prevents settlers
from ever moving on from the moment of colonization. As evidence of this
constitutive contradiction, [critics have identified in settler-colonial
discourse symptoms of psychic distress such as disavowal, inversion, and
repression. Indeed, the frozen temporality of settler-colonial
narrative, fixated on the moment of the frontier, recalls nothing so
much as Freud's description of the 'repetition compulsion' attending
trauma.]{.underline} As Lorenzo Veracini puts it, because: '**[settler
society' can thus be seen as a fantasy where a perception of a constant
struggle is juxtaposed against an ideal of 'peace' that can never be
reached, settler projects embrace and reject violence at the same
time]{.underline}**. The settler colonial situation is thus a
circumstance where the tension between contradictory impulses produces
long-lasting psychic conflicts and a number of associated
psychopathologies. [Current scholarship has thus focused primarily on
settler-colonial narrative's view of the past, asking how such a
contradictory and troubled relationship to history might affect
present-day ideological formations]{.underline}. Critics have rarely
considered what such narratological tensions might produce when the
settler gaze is turned to the future. [Few social formations are more
stubbornly resistant to change than settlement, suggesting that a future
beyond settler colonialism might be simply unthinkable.]{.underline}
Veracini, indeed, suggests that settler-colonial narrative can never
contemplate an ending: that settler decolonization is inconceivable
because settlers lack the metaphorical tools to imagine their own
demise. This article outlines why I partly disagree with that view. I
argue that **[the narratological paradox that defines settler-colonial
narrative does make the future a problematic object of contemplation.
But that does not make settler decolonization unthinkable per
se]{.underline}**; as I will show, **[settlers do often try to imagine
their demise -- but they do so in a way that reasserts the paradoxes of
their founding ideology, with the result that the radical potentiality
of decolonization is undone even as it is invoked]{.underline}**. I
argue that, notwithstanding Veracini's analysis, [there is a metaphor
via which the end of settler colonialism unspools -- the
quasi-biological concept of extinction, which, when deployed as a
narrative trope, offers settlers a chance to consider and disavow their
demise, just as they consider and then disavow the violence of their
origins.]{.underline} This article traces the importance of the trope of
extinction for contemporary settler-colonial literature, with a focus on
South Africa, Canada, and Australia. It explores variations in how the
death of settler colonialism is conceptualized, drawing a distinction
between historio-civilizational narratives of the rise and fall of
empires, and [a species-oriented notion of extinction]{.underline} that
[draws force from public anxiety about climate change]{.underline} --
[an invocation that adds another level of ambivalence by drawing on
'rational' fears for the future (because climate change may well render
the planet uninhabitable to humans) in order to narrativize a form
of social death that, strictly speaking, belongs to a different order of
knowledge altogether.]{.underline} As such, my analysis is intended to
draw the attention of settler-colonial studies toward futurity and the
ambivalence of settler paranoia, while highlighting a potential point of
cross-fertilization between settler-colonial and eco-critical approaches
to contemporary literature. **[That 'extinction' should be a key word in
the settler-colonial lexicon is no surprise.]{.underline}** In Patrick
Wolfe's phrase, [settler colonialism is predicated on a 'logic of
elimination' that tends towards the extermination -- by one means or
another -- of indigenous peoples]{.underline}. This logic is apparent in
archetypal settler narratives like James Fenimore Cooper's The Last of
the Mohicans (1826), a historical novel whose very title blends the
melancholia and triumph that demarcate settlers' affective responses to
the supposed inevitability of indigenous extinction. Concepts like
'stadial development' -- by which societies progress through stages,
progressively eliminating earlier social forms -- and 'fatal impact' --
which names the biological inevitability of strong peoples supplanting
weak -- all contribute to the notion that [settler colonialism is a kind
of 'ecological process' that necessitates the extinction of inferior
races.]{.underline} [What is surprising, though, is how often the trope
of extinction also appears with reference to settlers themselves; it
makes sense for settlers to narrate how their presence entails others'
destruction, but it is less clear why their attempts to imagine futures
should presume extinction to be their own logical end as
well.]{.underline} The idea appears repeatedly in English-language
literary treatments of settler colonialism. Consider, for instance, the
following rumination on the future of South African settler society,
from Olive Schreiner's 1883 Story of an African Farm: It was one of
them, one of those wild old Bushmen, that painted those pictures there.
He did not know why he painted but he wanted to make something, so he
made these. \[...\] Now the Boers have shot them all, so that we never
see a yellow face peeping out among the stones. \[...\] And the wild
bucks have gone, and those days, and we are here. But we will be gone
soon, and only the stones will lie on, looking at everything like they
look now. In this example, the narrating settler character, Waldo,
recognizes prior indigenous inhabitation but his knowledge comes
freighted with an expected sense of biological superiority, made
apparent by his description of the 'Bushman's' 'yellow face', and lack
of mental self-awareness. What is not clear is why Waldo's contemplation
of colonial genocide should turn immediately to the assumption that a
similar fate awaits his people as well. A similar presumption of racial
vulnerability permeates other late nineteenth-century novels from the
imperial metropole, such as Dracula and War of the Worlds, which are
plotted around the prospect of invasions that would see the extinction
of British imperialism, and, in the process, the human species. [Such
anxieties draw energy from a pattern of settler defensiveness that can
be observed across numerous settler-colonial contexts]{.underline}.
Marilyn Lake's and Henry Reynold's account of the emergence of
transnational 'whiteness' highlights the paradoxical fact that while
white male [settlers have been arguably the most privileged class in
history, they have routinely perceived themselves to be 'under siege',
threatened with destruction to the extent that their very identity of
'whiteness was born in the apprehension of imminent loss']{.underline}.
**[The fear of looming annihilation serves a powerful ideological
function in settler communities, working to foster racial solidarity,
suppress dissent, and legitimate violence against indigenous populations
who, by any objective measure, are far more at risk of extermination
than the settlers who fear them]{.underline}**. Ann Curthoys and Dirk
Moses have traced this pattern in Australia and Israel-Palestine,
respectively. This scholarship suggests that [narratives of settler
extinction are acts of ideological mystification, obscuring the brutal
inequalities of the frontier behind a mask of white
vulnerability]{.underline} -- an argument with which I sympathize.
However, this article shows how [there is more to settler-colonial
extinction narratives than bad faith]{.underline}. I argue that [we need
a more nuanced understanding of how they encode a specifically
settler-colonial framework for imagining the future, one that has
implications for how we understand contemporary literatures from settler
societies, and which allows us to see extinction as a genuine, if
flawed, attempt to envisage social change]{.underline}. In the remainder
of this paper I consider extinction's function as a metaphor of
decolonization. I use this phrase to invoke, without completely
endorsing, Tuck and Yang's argument that to treat decolonization
figuratively, as I argue extinction narratives do, is necessarily to
preclude radical change, creating opportunities for settler 'moves to
innocence' that re-legitimate racial inequality. [The counterview to
this pessimistic perspective is offered by Veracini, who suggests that
progressive change to settler-colonial relationships will only happen if
narratives can be found that make decolonization thinkable]{.underline}.
This article enters the debate between these two perspectives by asking
what it means for settler writers to imagine the future via the trope of
extinction. [Does extinction offer a meaningful way to think about
ending settler colonialism, or does it re-activate settler-colonial
patterns of thought that allow exclusionary social structures to
persist?]{.underline} I explore this question with reference to examples
of contemporary literary treatments of extinction from select
English-speaking settler-colonial contexts: South Africa, Australia, and
Canada.[15](http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/R5ynWgiXMUxegwR46F5A/full)15.
This focus is not intended to suggest the pattern cannot be found in
other contexts. In fact, scholarship has already drawn attention to
comparable formations in representations of the frontier from the United
States. William Handley's 2007 essay 'The Vanishing American' explores
how early twentieth-century cinema constructs Native Americans as
permanently locked in a state of imminent demise -- and how settler
national identity emerges through a slippage that means 'first Americans
are doomed and true Americans are doomed to civilization.' Handley's
article does not identify paranoia about white extinction per se, but
does show how the cliché of the doomed native is appropriated by
settlers for ambivalent ideological ends. William Handley, 'The
Vanishing American (1925)', in America First: Naming the Nation in U.S.

next section of this article traces key elements of extinction narrative
in a range of settler-colonial texts, while the section that follows
offers a detailed reading of one of the best examples of a sustained
literary exploration of human finitude, Margaret
Atwood's Maddaddam trilogy (2003--2013). I advance four specific
arguments. First, [extinction narratives take at least two forms
depending on whether the 'end' of settler society is framed primarily
in historical-civilizational terms or in a stronger, biological sense;
the key question is whether the 'thing' that is going extinct is
a society or a species]{.underline}. Second, **[biologically oriented
extinction narratives rely on a more or less conscious slippage between
'the settler' and 'the human']{.underline}**. Third, this slippage is
ideologically ambivalent: on the one hand, it contains a radical charge
that invokes environmentalist discourse and climate-change anxiety to
imagine social forms that re-write settler-colonial dynamics; on the
other, **[it replicates a core aspect of imperialist ideology by
normalizing whiteness as equivalent to humanity]{.underline}**. Fourth,
[these ideological effects are mediated by gender, insofar as extinction
narratives invoke issues of biological reproduction, community
protection, and violence that function to differentiate and reify
masculine and feminine roles in the putative de-colonial
future]{.underline}. Overall, my central claim is that extinction is a
core trope through which settler futurity emerges, one with crucial
narrative and ideological effects that shape much of the contemporary
literature emerging from white colonial settings.

Observing such inequities, humanitarians would come to assert that the
mistreatment of Aboriginal peoples and the theft of their land in
British settlements was a form of grave national sin, albeit an "evil of
comparatively recent origin."28 The affective, evangelical tones of such
assessment were stark. The landmark 1837 Report of the Parliamentary
Select Committee on the Aboriginal Tribes, which was established to
assess the treatment of Indigenous peoples in British settlements in the
face of colonisation, exemplified such debates about the virtue or sin
of colonisation among people of British origin. As Elizabeth Elbourne
has argued elsewhere, [the debate was "cast in Christian
terms]{.underline}... [and heavily influenced by evangelical Christian
ideas about sin, repentance and redempti]{.underline}on, although the
meaning and pertinence of Christianity were also sometimes at stake."29
[The Select Committee report "castigated settlers and traders for their
immoral treatment of indigenous peoples and argued that such treatment
contributed to \[their\] physical destruction and moral
degradation,"]{.underline} writes Elbourne. [Solutions proposed by the
committee included the metropolitan oversight of settler relationships
with Indigenous peoples]{.underline}, [envisioning]{.underline},
ultimately, the moral recreation of sinful settlers and non-Christian
Indigenes alike, and **[their eventual joint assimilation into an
imagined Christian community of the virtuous]{.underline}**.30 Examining
these debates, Elbourne argues "the focus of Colonial Office
administrators, of many British critics of imperial policy and of many
settlers themselves on sin and virtue, centred on the moral character of
the individual and of the nation alike, as well as on the morality of
the colonized." Yet often **[they neglected the "structural issues that
drove frontier conflict in the first place, despite moments of real
recognition of the importance of structure."31]{.underline}** Despite
self-representations, then, **[the benevolence of many colonial states
is seriously contestable]{.underline}**. Careful [interrogation of
self-interested settler claims to morality and justifications of
violence (both physical and representational) renders progressivist (and
presentist) arguments about the inherent civility of the (now) liberal
democratic "post"colonial state less than compelling]{.underline},
despite their continued articulation.32 So too [it is important to
recognise the ambivalence of benevolence and sympathy in colonial
contexts]{.underline}. As Asad argues, **[humanitarianism could use
"violence to subdue violence]{.underline}**" [and benevolent ideas often
played out in deeply paradoxical ways]{.underline}. In his view, we need
to consider the complexities and internal contradictions of
enlightenment thought in which "compassion and benevolence are
intertwined with violence and cruelty, an intertwining that is not
merely a co-existence of the two but a mutual dependence of each on the
other."33 [In the colonies outright physical violence and humanitarian
modes of action could constitute complementary modes of colonial
governance.]{.underline} Comparisons across differing colonial contexts
are revealing. While the settler colonies powerfully galvanised
humanitarians, India did not inspire the same fervour in metropolitan
activists, Jordanna Bailkin argues.34 Despite early and vigorous
missionary efforts---across denominations, and against the strenuous
resistance of the East India Company---external humanitarian interest in
India was limited, even if discrete issues such as sati attracted
widespread metropolitan outrage.35 Thus the South Asian colonial
executive assumed much of the responsibility for humanitarian effort,
producing a contradictory and limited sphere of action but also avoiding
much of the rancour that characterised other colonial contact zones.
This circumstance did not mean that violent interactions between Indians
and Britons went unremarked. Indeed, in her study of how and when
Europeans could be held culpable for murder, Bailkin demonstrates that
[governors developed detailed strategies to manage White violence, while
the colonial judiciary effectively downgraded such violence into lesser
categories than murder. Indian and British sources depict White violence
quite differently]{.underline}---[the former as an endemic feature of
colonial rule,]{.underline} the latter as actions of rogue individuals,
often off-duty soldiers---but intriguingly the official archive on
interracial violence expanded in scope even as (White) culpability for
that violence was diminished through defensive court procedures that
rationalized the vulnerability of Indian bodies.36 [Interracial violence
deeply troubled the humanitarian precepts of manly behaviour that
fuelled the modern scientific theories of British leader]{.underline}s
such as Lord Curzon, yet Bailkin notes that such leaders were pilloried
by the vernacular press for bigotry: for Curzon, she concludes, [the
prosecution of White criminality was a way of "preserving the doctrine
of racial superiority via humanitarianism]{.underline}."37

### L -- Feminism 

#### Settler colonial analysis is a necessary prerequisite to feminism understandings of the world -- anything else is at odds with the uniqueness of Indigenous experiences

Given the [multiplicity of gendered, feminist and Indigenous approaches,
the implications of a gendered analysis for Indigenous struggles in
North America are inevitably varied and sometimes even
conflicting]{.underline}. As noted in the introduction to this article,
**[the relationship between feminist and Indigenous thought has, at
times, been antagonistic]{.underline}**. This [antagonism can be seen to
reflect the potential dangers of a gendered or feminist perspective for
Indigenous women and communities as a whole.]{.underline} Responses to
these dangers have been central to more recent articulations of
Indigenous Feminism, and are particularly relevant to this article given
its European academic context and its call for further gendered analyses
of Indigenous struggles in North America. Perhaps the most frequent and
forceful criticism of [feminist approaches to Indigenous politics is
that they divide, obscure or weaken Indigenous struggles]{.underline}.
[Some Indigenous women see themselves as oppressed first as Indigenous
people, and second (if at all) as women (St Denis 2007).]{.underline}
[**This approach rejects the very possibility of an Indigenous Feminism,
and with it the significance of the intersections explored through this
paper.** This criticism is reinforced by the perception of many
Indigenous women of dominant European and Euro‐Canadian feminisms that
they are part of a wider process of ideological
colonisation]{.underline}; that [such feminisms are once again framing
issues in terms of 'help' from more 'advanced' societies, and once again
silencing Indigenous voices themselve]{.underline}s (Green 2007: 20).
[This issue has been exacerbated by the dominance of emphases on
progressive and rationalist tendencies in European feminist
activism]{.underline}, **[placing it directly at odds with traditional
Indigenous values and in line with the notions of progress integral to
the colonial civilisation of the savage]{.underline}**. [Such versions
of feminism often share claims and interests with the broader Liberal
individualism of the dominant culture that Indigenous communities are
engaged in resisting.]{.underline} In addition, Indigenous women often
cannot see how they could stand as equals with Euro‐Canadian women
against male power when those women are implicated in Indigenous
oppression. [The continued emergence of this criticism echoes
post‐structuralist, non‐European and Socialist feminists, in its
suggestion that more visible feminisms have not adequately addressed the
demand that some women recognise their role in the oppression of other
women.]{.underline} In this light, [the necessity of Indigenous voices,
perspectives and challenges to the European, Liberal hegemony within
feminism becomes visible. Feminists of the dominant culture have been
further accused of misinterpreting Indigenous notions of
difference]{.underline}. **[Indigenous women argue that they do not want
to fight for equality in a system they do not support.]{.underline}**
[Equality means sameness, Indigenous writers claim, and sameness means
the right for women to be men]{.underline} (St Denis 2007: 39). When
feminisms emerge in response to (and within) the dominant, patriarchal
culture, it is difficult to conceive of a different but equal
possibility for gender. Once again, [this issue can be linked to a
frequent emphasis by Liberal Feminists on the value of 'public' over
domestic roles]{.underline} -- the 'g[lass ceiling', for example, might
have little relevance to most women in Indigenous
communities]{.underline}. **[This is another indication that an
Indigenous Feminism might look very different to a Liberal, European
one.]{.underline}** A final danger lies in the [academic theorising of
gender within Indigenous communities, which risks othering and
homogenising the category of Indigenous women.]{.underline} Whilst
'clarity about gender may be a compelling goal' for both activists and
academics, 'it is often achieved at the expense of the visibility,
agency and identity of those represented' (Mihesuah 2003: 5). [To
homogenise Indigenous women is problematic when different backgrounds
might shape the interests of individual women differently. Urban and
rural Indigenous women might, for example, have interests that cannot be
represented by a single feminist agenda, or which might cut across a
conception of unified 'Indigenous' interests.]{.underline}

#### Engaging in settler colonial studies is a prerequisite to their feminist critique -- status quo gender studies ignore the unique position that INdigenous folk occupy in society

Although this article focuses primarily on gender and women\'s studies,
[Native feminist theories also importantly highlight how ethnic studies
has failed to adequately address settler colonialism]{.underline}.
Attending to [settler colonialism requires a significant departure from
how gender and women\'s studies and ethnic studies are regularly
understood and taught]{.underline}. Conventionally[, it is assumed that
gender and women\'s studies is inclusive of those who identify as women
and indeed all peoiople who are gendered, and that ethnic studies
addresses Indigenous concerns, along with those of other ethnic
groups.]{.underline} These fields teach people to think about themselves
in relation to a gendered and racialized society (Omi and Winant 1994).
However, **[engaging settler colonialism involves different frameworks
from the ones these fields often prioritize.]{.underline}** While both
gender and women\'s studies and ethnic studies unmask gender and race as
social constructions, with often devastating material effects for women
and nonwhite people, respectively, these [fields also expose various
mythologies about gender and race, including the myth of misogyny and
racism as to-be-expected characteristics of human nature.]{.underline}
Yet, within this important work[, too often the consideration of
Indigenous peoples remains rooted in understanding
colonialism]{.underline} (like statesanctioned slavery) [as an
historical point in time away from which our society has
progressed.]{.underline} [Centering settler colonialism within gender
and women\'s studies and]{.underline} [ethnic studies]{.underline}
instead [exposes the still-existing structure of settler colonization
and its powerful effects on Indigenous peoples and others]{.underline}.
This [recognition within gender and women\'s studies and ethnic studies
makes possible new visions of what decolonization might look like for
all peoples. It also opens up the possibility of new forms of activism
based on critically thought-out alliances, rather than always taking the
shape of alliances within and between seemingly naturally formed and
identifiable groups of people-namely, women and people of color-as
given.]{.underline} In fact, [the prevalence of liberal multicultural
discourses today]{.underline} **[effectively works to maintain settler
colonialism because they make it easy to assume that all minorities and
ethnic groups are different though working toward inclusion and
equality,]{.underline}** each in its own similar and parallel way.
**[Justice is often put in terms that coincide with the expansion of the
settler state]{.underline}** (see Scott Lauria Morgensen \[2011\] for a
discussion of the compatibility of queer politics with white normativity
and settler society). [While Indigenous peoples do form important
alliances with people of color]{.underline}, [Indigenous communities\'
concerns are often not about achieving formal equality or civil rights
within a nationstate,]{.underline} **[but instead achieving substantial
independence from a Western nation-state-independence decided on their
own terms]{.underline}**. [The feminist concerns of white women, women
of color, and Indigenous women thus often differ and conflict with one
another.]{.underline} In other words, [within the context of land and
settler **colonialism, the issues facing Indigenous women, as
inseparable from the issues facing Indigenous peoples as a whole, are
resolved via decolonization and sovereignty, not (just)
parity.**]{.underline}

### L -- Fiat 

#### The affirmatives use of fiat to analyze arms sales inevitably fails through blinding ontological structures -- their politics occupies a [parasitic relationship]{.underline} with native and black violence

I am inclined to agree with Wilderson that **[the Leninist question of
"what is to be done" is in the wrong direction.]{.underline}** The
question itself fails to grasp the severity of the problem we face[. To
ask "what is to be done" is to first understand the problem one faces
and secondly presumes that the problem one faces can be articulated,
that one is deprived of something that can be named rather than deprived
of being able to lose.]{.underline} **[To address this, what is needed
is a radical shift in orientation in our scholarship and ethics that
focuses on the question of understanding and ending the structures that
make our, Red and Black, existence impossible rather than asking what is
to be done within the epistemologies and ethics of those
structures.]{.underline}** When Subcomandante Marcos asks Presidente
Salinas why do we need to be pardoned, when he asks what are we to be
pardoned for, and when he asks who should ask for pardon, and who can
grant it, he is not merely exposing the gratuitous violence of the
Settler upon Red bodies, he is revealing the impossibility of an answer.
If this paper is forced to offer a solution, however meager, it is for
Red bodies to relinquish their desire to be structurally adjusted into
the Human fold, a fold which will never solve or relieve our problems
because our problems are the condition of possibility for that fold's
existence. [In realizing how our desire is structured not only as a fear
of Slaveness, but of Savageness, we can better come to form survival
strategies for our communities and, as Fanon suggests, set to
work.]{.underline}

### L -- Food Insecurity

#### Trade and policy are a double edged to sword to suppressing Native populations especially deterring their rights to accessing food and creating impoverishment. 

**McMillan 15---**Jane L. McMillan is a professor at St. Francis Xavier
University in Anthropology. (Fall of 2015, "Colonial Impediments to

RC)

Between 1763 and 1921 hundreds of agreements, compacts, historical and
territorial treaties were negotiated, outlining trade, commercial
activities and settlement.26 H.W. Crawley, an Indian Commissioner in
Cape Breton in 1849 reported that: Under present circumstances no
adequate protection can be obtained for the Indian property. It would be
in vain to seek a verdict from any jury in this Island against the
trespassers on the reserves; nor perhaps would a member of the Bar be
found willingly and effectually to advocate the cause of the Indians,
inasmuch as he would thereby injure his own prospects, by damaging his
popularity.27 The Colonial Office had legal functions, but was difficult
to administer from overseas, and more difficult to prevent corruption in
its administration, such as in the operation of truckhouses, which were
to regulate trade.28 [Bureaucratic crookedness facilitated the theft of
Indigenous lands and resources and impeded legal challenges by
Indigenous peoples. The *Gradual Civilization Act* of 1857 was enacted
to prevent such corruption and emerged from an 1839 statute designed to
protect Indian lands from squatters.]{.underline} **[This legislation
formed the basis of the legal dualism that characterizes the *Indian
Act*, 1876.29 The *Indian Act* was to protect Indigenous interests but
simultaneously prohibited them from exercising their rights as
Indigenous peoples. That legal dualism existed within the treaties is
another dimension, but one not recognized during colonial expansion and
domination.]{.underline}** [The historical record shows little to **no
enforcement of laws protecting Indigenous lands.**]{.underline} [The
Doctrine of Discovery, the fiction of *terra nullius*, frozen rights
theories, extinguishment and frontier myths justified doctrines of
wholesale assimilation and precipitated catastrophic marginalization and
alienation of Indigenous peoples from their lands and
resources.]{.underline} [With the Confederation of Canada in the
*British North America Act* 1867, and the consolidation of colonial
Indian policies into the *Indian Act* in 1876, the prohibition and
criminalization of Indigenous livelihoods became the order of the
day.]{.underline}30 [Indigenous peoples did not passively acquiesce to
the imposition of the colonial legal order. On the contrary, they
resisted assimilation and continued to invoke their own legal
traditions]{.underline}.31 For centuries Indigenous leaders petitioned
Crown officials in London against British violations of the treaties.
[Petitions made between 181432 and beyond 1982, cited numerous
transgressions of human rights, racial discrimination, theft of
property, illegal confiscation of lands, unjustifiable trade
restrictions and violations of persons. They also noted the extreme
poverty, starvation and poor health in which Indigenous peoples lived as
consequences of British colonization and rules of containment. The
petitions went largely unanswered, but Indigenous peoples continued to
resist occupation of their lands, persisted in procuring food through
hunting and fishing and to this day, when charged under]{.underline}
Canadian [laws, to resist prosecution through claims to historical
treaty and statutory rights]{.underline}.33 [The details of the
historical and contemporary legal struggles of Indigenous peoples to
exercise Aboriginal rights, sustain food security and participate in
trade are beyond the scope]{.underline} of this brief commentary. The
Supreme Court of Canada has recognized and affirmed Aboriginal treaty
rights to hunt and fish for food and earn livelihoods in a number of
decisions, for example *R*. v. *Simon* (1985), *R.* v*. Horseman*
(1990), *R.* v*. Badger* (1996) and *R.* v*. Marshall* (1999). The
Supreme Court has also set out the meaning and significance of the
constitutional recognition and affirmation of Aboriginal and treaty
rights in s. 35(1) of the *Constitution Act, 1982* in a series of cases
including *R*. v. *Sparrow*, *R.* v. *Van der Peet* and *Delgamuukw* v.
*B.C.*.34 Despite these important legal advancements food security
remains unobtainable for the majority of Indigenous peoples in Canada[.
The health of Indigenous peoples is markedly impoverished compared to
most]{.underline} Canadians. [Indigenous peoples are constrained by
state regulations that continue to infringe their Aboriginal and treaty
rights, their ability to trade and their access to customary,
traditional or country foods. Studies show that **Indigenous peoples'
chronic disease risk tends to increase as a result of government
policies that infringe on Indigenous peoples' livelihoods and
territories**. **Policies intended to increase food security**,
including food aid, fuel nutrition transition, **characterized by a
rapid westernization of diet and lifestyle associated with an
intensification of the prevalence of chronic diseases**, such as
diabetes and obesity]{.underline}.35

\*\*this cards says more than the tag does

#### Colonialism relies on unsustainable methods of resources extraction and food security by not only using it as a reason to justify settlerism, but also to carry out the slow Native genocide.

The four [pillars of food security identified]{.underline} by the World
Summit on Food Security in Rome 2009, as availability, access,
utilization and stability, [are helpful guides to examining the
experiences of Indigenous peoples]{.underline} (1) [food security and
food sovereignty and the consequences of European and settler
colonialism]{.underline} in Canada. (2) As Orford notes, [\"The
**first** European **colonial settlers** **came from societies** which
were **\'constantly on the edge of famine and demographic collapse\'**,
**and the liberal theories that justified their appropriation of the
\'waste lands\' occupied by hunter-gathers were an attempt \'to save the
lives\' of Europeans.\"**]{.underline} **(**3) Modern humans (Homo
sapiens sapiens) appeared in North America during the Wisconsin
glaciation, 50,000-10,000 BP. (4) [As cultural development increased in
the Americas, numerous Indigenous peoples, communities and then nations
began to occupy and shape the lands]{.underline} of what is now Canada.
[Indigenous peoples believe this is the land of their origins
and]{.underline} recount in their many and varied myths and cosmological
theories, [descriptions of their sacred and practical ancestral
relationships to the lands and resources.]{.underline} Archaeological
evidence indicates [food resources were copious; big game abounded, fish
were plentiful and foraging technologies for land and sea evolved
quickly.]{.underline} (5) \"[Traditional Indigenous economies have
tended to involve the simultaneous and proximal use of multiple
resources on a subsistence basis, rather than the intensive, isolated,
single resource use that characterizes industrial capitalist
economies]{.underline}.\" (6) Nicolas Denys, a French explorer and
merchant, accompanied Issac de Razilly who was commissioned by Cardinal
Richelieu in 1632 (7) to be the lieutenant-general of Acadia, a colony
of New France in northeastern North America. Their mission was to
establish colonies for France in the territories of the Mi\'kmaq,
Maliseet, Abenaki and Passamaquoddy (8) Denys\' writings depict the time
of early, but sustained, European incursions and settlement into long
occupied Indigenous territories[. Across the expanse of North America
Indigenous peoples developed diverse and sophisticated farming, hunting
and foraging strategies that richly influenced their cultural,
political, legal and economic structures, well in advance of the arrival
of settlers.]{.underline} Some communities were highly nomadic covering
large territorial ranges on foot, hunting and fishing on a seasonal
basis at known locales. Others, living in environments that allowed for
horticulture (usually maize, beans, and squash), aggregated and were
more sedentary. [Indigenous peoples\' collective ingenuity and knowledge
of their ecosystems enabled them to survive and often thrive for
thousands of years.]{.underline} Extensive trade networks supported
livelihood patterns. [**Their skill and** acquaintance with traditional
ecological **knowledge** and subsistence technologies **facilitated the
survival of the early settlers and the emergence of the dominance of a
Eurocentric nation-state.**The history and experiences of colonialism
are as diverse as the peoples upon which colonial policies and laws were
imposed.]{.underline} In the Atlantic region of North America
[Indigenous peoples felt the pressures of newcomers on their subsistence
endowments as French and then British penetrations into their
territories resulted in the misappropriation of Indigenous lands and
resources for reallocation to settlers.]{.underline} Traditional
broad-based diets, drawn from seasonal exploitation of both marine and
land resources, required access to coastal regions. [Settlers displaced
Indigenous peoples from the coasts, cutting them off from important
nutritional foods]{.underline}, especially seals, eels and other
culturally significant marine foods, [forcing them to rely on the less
predictable fallback foods of the interior. Indigenous communities
suffered rapid population declines due to European borne epidemics and
warfare. Emerging food scarcity heightened loss of life through
starvation.]{.underline}11 **[Colonization requires formal political
control of a territory, and a population, by a state, through a
specialized administrative apparatus, with an ideology justifying such
control.]{.underline}** Anthropologist Laura Nader argues that **law as
cultural control is inseparable from political and religious
colonization, and that the understanding of hegemonic ideational control
must be connected to our knowledge of social or institutional
control.**12 Colonial myths have long held that North America was a
vast, uninhabited, yet bountiful wilderness, ripe for European conquest,
and readily available for civilization through superior technology and
social mores of the more 'evolved' cultures of the 'Old World'.
Portrayals of colonial encounters often celebrated the benevolent
actions of settlers, missionaries, and colonial officials and their
generous assistance in assimilating Indigenous peoples into settler
society. [As settler populations adapted to the environment and
expanded, demands for Indigenous labor decreased. **By violating or
denying the sovereignty, values and norms of Indigenous peoples,
European colonizers disrupted, often with force, political, economic,
kinship, legal and religious orders**]{.underline}. **[Without doubt,
settler activities destabilized Indigenous food security by limiting
availability, controlling access, and regulating utilization of
Indigenous lands and resources.]{.underline}**13 [Settler populations
became increasingly hostile, interfering with food procurement practices
and seasonal rounds by preventing access to the coasts.]{.underline} In
the Atlantic region of the 'New World', British efforts to promote
settlement among English speaking Protestants were largely unsuccessful
until the defeat of the French and creation of Halifax in the mid 1700s.
In establishing its new colony, the British created the Nova Scotia
Council in 1720, as the King's chief administrative body. The governor
appointed the council members, who possessed wide-ranging powers,
including the right to overrule the governor's authority, and to act as
a court of law in which the French could be brought into submission.14
The British could not simply ignore the Mi'kmaq (the predominate
Indigenous peoples in this territory), as their retaliatory efforts
interfered with British commercial designs in the fish and fur trade.
The British solution was to enter into treaty with the Mi'kmaq and other
Indigenous signatories. Here British [laws were the, "cutting edge of
colonialism, an instrument of power of the alien state and part of the
process of coercion"]{.underline}15 [that undermined Mi'kmaq cultural
production and sovereignty as framed by their geopolitical subsistence
patterns.]{.underline} [The imposition of colonial policies and laws
redefined Indigenous relations with the newcomers in their
territories.]{.underline} Since the [Mi'kmaq participated in treaty
negotiations, they must have had an explicit political order and a
common political will or they could not have exerted any influence on
the treaty-making process. Without such a political order the treaties
would have been redundant]{.underline}, as the British [could have
simply forced themselves on the Mi'kmaq through military
means]{.underline}. That the British did not, and recognized that they
could not, and were worried even as late as 1808 about the dangers the
Mi'kmaq posed to British Nova Scotia's security, indicates that such an
order did exist. There is no more telling proof of this than the British
signed not just one treaty with the Mi'kmaq but five separate agreements
over fifty-three years between 1726 and 1779.16 The 1726 agreement was a
peace and friendship treaty designed to end years of conflict between
the British and Mi'kmaq, and end the "Indian wars" taking place in the
northeast. British planned to use the treaty to incorporate the Mi'kmaq
into a network of British colonies directed against their French
adversaries. The treaty consists of two parts. The first part - the
articles of peace and agreement---was signed by the Mi'kmaq, Maliseet,
Passamaquoddy and Penobscot delegates and intended to guide their future
relations with British colonies. The second part of the treaty
encompasses the reciprocal promises made to the aboriginal communities
by Nova Scotia officials. Indigenous peoples resisted to English
encroachment on their lands. As first inhabitants and rightful owners of
the territories, they rejected the notion of anyone else holding
jurisdiction over them, or their resources. Indigenous nations asserted
their sovereignty; any right to settle their lands derived from their
authority, not some invisible king in a foreign land. In the reciprocal
promises of the treaties, it was guaranteed that Indigenous hunting,
fishing and gathering assets and strategies would be protected. The
treaties thus assured Indigenous peoples could continue to exercise
their customary rights on their lands and engage in trade. They also
implied the British should settle elsewhere so as not to interfere with
Indigenous subsistence practices on those lands. As was customary among
the Mi'kmaq, permission to access and ritualized reimbursement were
required before lands could be used. Trespassers had to pay for protocol
violations to make things right according to Mi'kmaq laws.17 These
practices were necessary to honour their ancestral connections to the
territory and to rebalance their symbiotic relationships with all things
human, and other than human to secure future prosperity.18 These
Indigenous patterns of occupancy, management, and work, conflicted with
those of the British and French. Wicken concludes: Thus, when the
Mi'kmaq were told that the British would not molest them 'in their
persons, Hunting, Fishing and Planting Grounds nor in any other their
Lawfully Occasion,' [they understood this to mean that in these areas
they would exercise some form of control that would enable them to
protect their hunting and fishing lands from outside interference. This
control would include the right to regulate outsider's travels through
their lands]{.underline} - a right that included regulating the movement
of New England traders.19Following the Peace and Friendship treaty
period the British expanded their colonial rule. The Royal
Proclamation20 issued by King George III in 1763, explicitly recognized
Aboriginal rights," And where as it is just and reasonable, and
essential to our Interest, and the Security of our Colonies, that the
several Nation of Tribes of Indians with whom We are connected, and who
live under our Protection, should not be molested or disturbed in the
Possession of such Parts of Our Dominions and Territories as, not having
been ceded to or purchased by Us, are reserved to them or any of them,
as their Hunting Grounds \... and "Trade with the said Indians shall be
free and open to all."21 As noted by Orford, "Colonial trade was enabled
through government by unrepresentative assemblies under intimidation by
powerful companies that had gained power and thus influence through
commercial monopolies. The merchants who carried on colonial trade had
become the principal advisors to the government on the regulation of
that trade, with the result that the interests of the merchants were
'more considered than those of either the colonies or the mother
country."22 Adam Smith's cautions around colonial rule and mercantilism
rang true in these colonies. In the late eighteenth century a special
committee of the Legislative Council of Nova Scotia ruled that the
hunting way of life constituted an obstruction to 'civilization'.
Benefits and assistance to Indigenous peoples henceforth would be
directed wholly toward compelling bands to take up farming: any group
that failed to conform to official mandates would be 'abandoned to their
Fate'. To this end the Mi'kmaq were being offered no protections, legal
or otherwise, against settler encroachment on the enclaves arranged for
them by license. Loyalist influxes after the Revolutionary War brought
hunters into the interior for moose hides, killing thousands of animals
in a single season for their profitable skins and leaving the carcasses
to rot.23 Evidence in the pre and early Confederation context supports
Orford's claim that, "[European lawyers developed doctrines that
rationalized the acquisition of territory for agricultural settlement,
posited freedom of trade and navigation as inalienable rights, justified
the enclosure of common land, authorized the conduct of imperial trading
companies, and justified the policing of dispossessed people who
resisted such practices.]{.underline}"24 [With certainty, "as
territories were settled and colonial rulers were increasingly faced
with 'rebellion, resistance, and instability']{.underline}, [lawyers and
colonial officials would move from developing doctrines justifying war
to those explaining the principles of administration and
policing]{.underline}."25 Between 1763 and 1921 hundreds of agreements,
compacts, historical and territorial treaties were negotiated, outlining
trade, commercial activities and settlement.26 H.W. Crawley, an Indian
Commissioner in Cape Breton in 1849 reported that: Under present
circumstances no adequate protection can be obtained for the Indian
property. It would be in vain to seek a verdict from any jury in this
Island against the trespassers on the reserves; nor perhaps would a
member of the Bar be found willingly and effectually to advocate the
cause of the Indians, inasmuch as he would thereby injure his own
prospects, by damaging his popularity.27 The Colonial Office had legal
functions, but was difficult to administer from overseas, and more
difficult to prevent corruption in its administration, such as in the
operation of truckhouses, which were to regulate trade.28 [Bureaucratic
crookedness facilitated the theft of Indigenous lands and resources and
impeded legal challenges by Indigenous peoples. The *Gradual
Civilization Act* of 1857 was enacted to prevent such corruption and
emerged from an 1839 statute designed to protect Indian lands from
squatters.]{.underline} **[This legislation formed the basis of the
legal dualism that characterizes the *Indian Act*, 1876.29 The *Indian
Act* was to protect Indigenous interests but simultaneously prohibited
them from exercising their rights as Indigenous peoples. That legal
dualism existed within the treaties is another dimension, but one not
recognized during colonial expansion and domination.]{.underline}** [The
historical record shows little to **no enforcement of laws protecting
Indigenous lands.**]{.underline} [The Doctrine of Discovery, the fiction
of *terra nullius*, frozen rights theories, extinguishment and frontier
myths justified doctrines of wholesale assimilation and precipitated
catastrophic marginalization and alienation of Indigenous peoples from
their lands and resources.]{.underline} [With the Confederation of
Canada in the *British North America Act* 1867, and the consolidation of
colonial Indian policies into the *Indian Act* in 1876, the prohibition
and criminalization of Indigenous livelihoods became the order of the
day.]{.underline}30 [Indigenous peoples did not passively acquiesce to
the imposition of the colonial legal order. On the contrary, they
resisted assimilation and continued to invoke their own legal
traditions]{.underline}.31 For centuries Indigenous leaders petitioned
Crown officials in London against British violations of the treaties.
[Petitions made between 181432 and beyond 1982, cited numerous
transgressions of human rights, racial discrimination, theft of
property, illegal confiscation of lands, unjustifiable trade
restrictions and violations of persons. They also noted the extreme
poverty, starvation and poor health in which Indigenous peoples lived as
consequences of British colonization and rules of containment. The
petitions went largely unanswered, but Indigenous peoples continued to
resist occupation of their lands, persisted in procuring food through
hunting and fishing and to this day, when charged under]{.underline}
Canadian [laws, to resist prosecution through claims to historical
treaty and statutory rights]{.underline}.33 [The details of the
historical and contemporary legal struggles of Indigenous peoples to
exercise Aboriginal rights, sustain food security and participate in
trade are beyond the scope]{.underline} of this brief commentary. The
Supreme Court of Canada has recognized and affirmed Aboriginal treaty
rights to hunt and fish for food and earn livelihoods in a number of
decisions, for example *R*. v. *Simon* (1985), *R.* v*. Horseman*
(1990), *R.* v*. Badger* (1996) and *R.* v*. Marshall* (1999). The
Supreme Court has also set out the meaning and significance of the
constitutional recognition and affirmation of Aboriginal and treaty
rights in s. 35(1) of the *Constitution Act, 1982* in a series of cases
including *R*. v. *Sparrow*, *R.* v. *Van der Peet* and *Delgamuukw* v.
*B.C.*.34 [Despite these important legal advancements food security
remains unobtainable for the majority of Indigenous peoples]{.underline}
in Canada[. The health of Indigenous peoples is markedly impoverished
compared to most]{.underline} Canadians. [Indigenous peoples are
constrained by state regulations that continue to infringe their
Aboriginal and treaty rights, their ability to trade and their access to
customary, traditional or country foods. Studies show that **Indigenous
peoples' chronic disease risk tends to increase as a result of
government policies that infringe on Indigenous peoples' livelihoods and
territories**. **Policies intended to increase food security**,
including food aid, fuel nutrition transition, **characterized by a
rapid westernization of diet and lifestyle associated with an
intensification of the prevalence of chronic diseases**, such as
diabetes and obesity]{.underline}.35The UN Joint Brief on ["The Right to
Food and Indigenous Peoples" presents the right to food as a collective
right, although supplementary to an individual right, and promotes a
rights based approach to food security that requires "particular
attention to Indigenous peoples' specific circumstances and
concerns."]{.underline}36 Specific **[Indigenous concerns have not
been]{.underline}** well **[met in international law]{.underline}**.
Answers **[to the crises of food security may be found through
management and trade alternatives directed by Indigenous peoples and, as
well, the full recognition and implementation of treaty
rights.]{.underline}** The answers are less likely to be found
internationally in ad hoc exceptions from WTO regulations and EU bans
which prejudice markets against Indigenous means of subsistence, and
collapse commercialization potential of the products of customary
harvesting.37 Nor will the answers be found within state-imposed
regulations, licensing programs and policies that produce obstacles to
the procurement, distribution and commodification of customary or
country foods, while subsidizing 'healthy food choices' as well as "ice
cream, bacon and processed cheese spread" through programs such as
Nutrition North. The Nutrition North program is a government of Canada
subsidy program to improve access to perishable foods for remote
northern communities. In order to qualify for a subsidy, country or
traditional food such as Arctic char, muskox and caribou must either be,
"shipped by plane from registered Country food processors/ distributors
and processed in government regulated and/or approved-for- export
commercial plants or shipped by plane from the South by a registered
Northern retailer or Southern supplier and subsidized at the same level
as other store-bought meat." Country foods constitute less then 1% of
the available Nutrition North subsidies.38 [Indigenous peoples around
the world pressed for the adoption of the *United Nations Declaration on
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples* for decades.39 The Declaration
provides an unambiguous assertion of the "\...urgent need to respect and
promote inherent rights of indigenous peoples\...especially their rights
to their lands, territories and resources"]{.underline}40 [Many of the
rights specified concern the enabling of conditions that are critical to
advancing Indigenous peoples' determination of their social and economic
development.]{.underline} For instance, the language in Articles 3, 18,
20, 21, 23, 27 and 32 affirms the right of Indigenous peoples to
self-determination and decision-making with respect to access to and use
of territories and resources for the purposes of social and economic
development. I agree with Orford that, "[At stake are core questions
about the obligation of states to protect the welfare of their own
populations, the forms of political action needed to preserve democracy
in the face of rural distress and dispossession, and the means available
to societies seeking to preserve traditional or communal relationships
to land."]{.underline}41 To move beyond stated intentions of the UN
Declaration, nations must be prepared to take on and resolve
considerable challenges. [First among these in many settings is the need
to change existing]{.underline} resource use and socioeconomic
development policies and [practices so that Indigenous people are
empowered to exercise their rights within a context that enables respect
for and expression of traditional knowledge and culture. This **starting
point positively addresses** the current crises of availability, access,
utilization and stability---the pillars of **food
security.**]{.underline}

#### The scope of food insecurity should focus on its relation to impacting Indigenous People because it will eventually impact all of humanity and other species.

Humans are completely dependent on healthy environments for their health
and well-being. Global human food systems have been created and
supported by a combination of the earth's multitudes of life forms and
ecosystems and by human ingenuity, developed and shared over many
thousands of years. [Today, however, both the cultural diversity and the
global biodiversity that gave rise to human food systems are threatened
in many places, and Indigenous Peoples' food systems are particularly
vulnerable]{.underline} (Davis, 2001; Carlson and Maffi, 2004; Wilson,
1992). To maintain the integrity of human food systems around the world,
the environmental problems affecting biodiversity and biological
productivity must be addressed, as the survival of the life forms that
provide food, directly and indirectly, is fundamental to the well- being
of human cultures and populations. [The state of each region's
ecosystems and their capacity to support Indigenous Peoples' food
systems is of fundamental importance. Indigenous communities
participating in the program identified several major environmental
problems that negatively affect their overall food security and food
systems]{.underline} (Table 3.1). These include specific concerns, such
as declining populations of resource species: caribou in northern
Canada, ooligans and salmon on the west coast of Canada, and crop
diversity for bananas and other species in Pohnpei, Dalit and Karen
communities in the Federated States of Micronesia, India and Thailand,
respectively. [They also incorporate some impacts that are more indirect
but just as significant, such as deforestation, water deterioration,
soil erosion and climate change. Each of these conditions and situations
affects not only the case study indigenous communities, but also many
other Indigenous Peoples and, **eventually, all humanity and other
species on the globe.**]{.underline} As many Indigenous Peoples hold a
"kincentric" worldview, in which all species are respected as close
relatives, the notion of harm to species such as polar bears, salmon or
orca whales is as alarming and upsetting as direct impacts on human
communities themselves (Salmón, 2000; Senos *et al.*, 2006). In the
following sections, four of the overriding [environmental problems that
affect Indigenous Peoples' food systems are described in more detail to
demonstrate the complex web of issues that are involved with each:
biodiversity loss, especially of food species; hydroelectric dams and
their effects; contamination of water and food; and global climate
change.]{.underline}

### L -- Futurity

#### The affirmative functions to maintain settler sovereignty by securing the settler state against threats as they fail to manage futurisms failing and dispose of marginalized populations

Hobbes's vacillation, confusion, and ultimate retraction of any concrete
examples of the state of nature can be productively deciphered by
linking it to theories of settler colonialism, on the one hand, and
Edelman's critique of futurism, on the other. Regarding the first,
Lorenzo Veracini has argued that settler colonialism is distinct from
other types of colonialism insofar as its seeks consistently to erase
itself as settler colonial, to "supersede the conditions of its
operation."77 Following Patrick Wolfe's argument that [settler
colonialism pursues a "logic of elimination" whereby settlers seek to
replace the natives and indigenize themselves]{.underline} post facto,78
Veracini argues that [because it aims at the elimination of the native,
settler colonialism necessarily aims at its own
elimination]{.underline}: The [successful settler colonies "tame" a
variety of wildernesses, end up establishing independent nations,
effectively repress, co- opt, and extinguish indigenous alterities, and
productively manage ethnic diversity]{.underline}. By the end of this
trajectory, [they claim to be no longer settler colonial (they are
putatively "settled" and "postcolonial"]{.underline}--- except that
unsettling anxieties remain, and references to a postcolonial condition
appear hollow as soon as indigenous disadvantage is taken into account).
Settler colonialism thus covers its tracks and operates towards its
self- supersession (this is why, paradoxically, settler colonialism is
most recognizable when it is most imperfect--- say, 1950s Kenya or 1970s
Zimbabwe--- and least visible in the settler cities).79 The truly
"successful" settler colonial project, in other words, would manage to
efface the native entirely, whether through genocide or assimilation or
some other form of disappearance--- more recently, via a politics of
recognition, as Glen Coulthard has argued.80 One way this happens is
through the narration of settlement itself, which disappears the native
through discourses of nonexistence, invisibility, or terra nullius. 81
In Hobbes, this emerges as his inability to definitively locate or
circumscribe the state of nature. This is consistent with the originary
imaginings of all settler polities. As Veracini observes, "It is not a
coincidence that the cultural traditions of the settler polities often
focus on real or imaginary locales putatively epitomising specific
national attributes: the 'outback,' the 'backblocks,' and, most
famously, the 'frontier.' Generally speaking, these are not specific
locations, and their most important characteristic is to be always
somewhere else."82 The state of nature is one such highly abstract
geographical imagining and, as we have seen, Hobbes displaces it from a
time to a condition to a place to a metaphor, eventually determining
that it never existed at all, even as a hermeneutic. Of course,
regardless of how Hobbes defines or determines the "state of nature,"
the fact of the matter is that neither settlement nor indigenous people
are, in fact, "elsewhere," but ever- present facts of the here and
now.83 Yet Veracini argues that [settler colonialism must nevertheless
constantly imagine native peoples as elsewhere, an act of symbolic
displacement that effaces the actual existence of native peoples and
erases them even in their existence:]{.underline} If the indigene is
fundamental to the settler relation, where the indigene is located does
matter. Thus, the "real" indigence is always somewhere else; that is
why, to play on Philip J. Deloria's insight, he is always "unexpected"
in actual places. Likewise, indigenous peoples are generally not seen in
the settler cities, the places where the settlers live. Examples abound;
the main point is that discursive devices aimed at redirecting attention
away from emplaced settler- indigenous relationships are indeed many.84
Veracini suggests that [all forms of indigenous removal can be
characterized as different versions of "transfer]{.underline}," which he
argues is foundational to the settler colonial project.85 Regardless of
whether we call it [transfer or elimination]{.underline}, however,
unless and [until it is accomplished, settler states engage in all sorts
of contortions, both political and ideological, to obscure the native in
order to naturalize conquest]{.underline}. In short, disappearance of
the land's indigenous inhabitants and subsequent attempts to
"indigenize" settlers are the means by which land expropriation is
simultaneously naturalized and obscured. Veracini presents this
iterative, imaginary displacement either as conceptually embedded in the
definition of settler colonialism or else as a kind of bad faith on the
settlers' part, potentially implying that a guilty conscience gives rise
to a host of defense mechanisms to ward off (knowledge of) conquest. In
other contexts, political theorists have considered that such recursive
movement is definitive of sovereignty itself, which can establish the
law only via a prior, extralegal, and illegitimate assertion of force.
Yet the recursive ideological contortions of settler sovereignty are
neither the result of guilt nor somehow intrinsic to its conceptual
definitions. Robert Nichols has already persuasively argued that the
recursive character of settlement is a means of facilitating
dispossession, denying the existence of indigenous peoples, and
disregarding their claims to land and sovereignty.86 So the materiality
of this operation is clear. Yet what to make of the specifically
ideological character of this recursivity? What explains the reiterative
rationales for conquest that attempt to erase it as conquest at all?
Borrowing from Edelman, one might say that while these [ideological
contortions are fundamental to settler colonialism, they are also
fundamental to any futurist narrativization of "life."]{.underline} In
other words, the reason why Hobbes cannot definitively locate or
circumscribe the state of nature is the same the reason why the settler
state seeks ideologically to naturalize settlers as native to the lands
they have conquered. It is because, to use Edelman's vocabulary, both
are futurist narrativizations of the drive, his Lacanian term for that
aspect of human existence that resists any temporal or symbolic
determination. Hobbes talks about this in terms of "endeavor." But
Edelman's drive/Hobbes's endeavor is what in fact defines the unending
present that is the time/condition/place of the state of nature; indeed,
Hobbes's state of nature is effectively an attempt at a representation
of this drive/endeavor, which both thinkers are clear is
unrepresentable. For, while Hobbes defines the motion of human life in
terms of desire and aversion, these terms are only appropriate monikers
for motion once it becomes perceptible. Before it is manifest in the
form of desire, it exists as "small beginnings of Motion, within the
body of man, before they appear in walking, speaking, striking, and
other visible actions."87 In other words, it is only once endeavor takes
an object and becomes motion toward something that it becomes
simultaneously apprehensible and also properly called desire, while
endeavor away from an object "is generally called Aversion."88 This
drive/endeavor is not only prior to or outside of representation, but it
also has no intrinsic justification, much less any clear or
uncontroversial narrative articulation. It simply is. Thus any
imposition of terms onto it--- in order to render it apprehensible,
coherent, or legible--- is precisely that, an imposition, and thus an
explicitly ideological move that serves a particular political agenda.
For Edelman, this act of transforming the otherwise unsignifiable
endeavor of human existence into "the fictive form of a narrative"89 is
the very definition of politics. As he says, "[politics is a name for
the temporalization of desire, for its translation into a narrative, for
its teleological determination]{.underline}."90 This definition of
politics explains his insistence that [politics]{.underline} is
necessarily "conservative"--- because "it [works to affirm a structure,
to authenticate a social order]{.underline}"91 in its very existence---
and also destined to fail. For Edelman, futurism perpetuates "the
fantasy of meaning's eventual realization," a realization that is by
definition impossible insofar as endeavor itself has no intrinsic
meaning and "the future" as its justification is always only ever to
come. As [the future, it is just out of reach, ever beyond our grasp,
"an always about- to- be- realized identity."]{.underline}92 Rather than
confront its own, necessary impossibility, Edelman argues that [futurism
instead generates scapegoats to distract from and take the fall for it,
people or places or events that become the displaced, villainized
obstacles to futurism's otherwise successful realization]{.underline}.
His name for these scapegoats is "queer." This queerness, also
unrepresentable because it is another name for the drive/endeavor that
politics (that is, narrativization) impossibly seeks to domesticate and
resolve, takes on the figure of whatever or whoever threatens the
disarticulation of the self and social order, which are ideologically
presumed to be the prepolitical premises of our existence. [This futile
and fantasmatic futurism is a surprisingly apt characterization of the
settler state, the full realization of which would, as Veracini notes,
effect its erasure]{.underline}. **[Settler colonies resort to any
number of destructive forms of managing futurism's failings, of course,
from transfer and removal to outright extermination through war,
massacre, starvation, and disease.]{.underline}** (There are also [a
multitude of cultural forms of indigenous "transfer," whether it be the
usage of indigenous peoples as sports team mascots, the fetishization of
indigenous religious and spiritual practices in order to deny Indianness
to Indians while claiming it for settlers, or the racialization of
Indians into minority populations.]{.underline}) Yet this anxious,
reiterative activity is wholly predictable from an Edelmanian
perspective and ineliminable from the structure of settler sovereignty,
because [the futurist narration of the drive/endeavor has rendered
**settlers** beholden to an unsustainable temporality that **must
produce** queerness or **death in order to continue to produce meaning,
survival, and civilization for itself**]{.underline}. **[Settler
sovereignty cannot]{.underline}**, in other words**[, do without the
death- native it brings into being; the native as death must exist in
order to purchase life and survival for the settler]{.underline}** and
is the figure of queerness in this futurist scheme. "Queerness" in
Hobbes is represented, figured, or embodied by those who fail to conform
to the lineaments of rationality that his particular sovereign formation
takes for granted--- in this case, the rational character of life and
its value. Hobbes calls these figures "absurd" rather than queer, but
the meaning is the same. The queer or absurd are those who do not seek
to preserve themselves or flee death. Such figures barely show up in
this text and are largely incomprehensible in his schema. They both
instantiate death and invite it as the only proper response to their
incomprehensible and insupportable rejection of the social order. For
example, [any remaining holdouts in the state]{.underline} of nature
[unwilling to join a majority decision to create a commonwealth must be
forced to go along with them "or be left in the condition of warre he
was in before; wherein he might without injustice be destroyed by any
man whatsoever]{.underline}."93 [This is the rationalization of
conquest]{.underline}, however abstract, unmarked, or "rational" it may
seem to be. For, as has become clear, [those who do not recognize the
value of life are not simply absurd or irrational; they are specifically
those "savage" or precivilizational people(s) who have no concept of
time or established system of governance]{.underline}. Of course, **[the
"savage" as deathly threat has been produced precisely as that threat by
the settler polity itself, which can only sustain itself via this
anxious, recursive, and impossible- to- resolve dynamic of producing and
eliminating the enemy of its own order]{.underline}**, [the enemy that
it requires if it is to be an order at all and yet that it must
eliminate if it is to "overcome" what it is]{.underline}. As Alyosha
Goldstein observes, "[United States colonialism is a continuously
failing--- or at least a perpetually incomplete--- project that labors
to find a workable means of resolution to sustain its logic of
possession and inevitability by disavowing the ongoing contestation with
which it is confronted and violent displacement that it
demands]{.underline}."94 This [constant aspiration toward an
unrealizable future is]{.underline} a promise [bought at the expense of
effacing the founding violence that is the institution of settler
sovereignty itself]{.underline}. Because that foundation is impossible
to leave behind, because [the native has not been finally eliminated
once and for all, because the subjects of the commonwealth remain
settlers, they cannot rest]{.underline}. They cannot rest until the last
trace of the native has been eliminated, such that settlement can become
a truly legitimate commonwealth founded on the basis of a free and equal
social contract of its "native" citizens. In the face of the
impossibility of this achievement, however, they must find other outlets
for their anxious desire. This is how and why **[the settler colonial
foundation of biopolitical sovereignty transforms itself into an
expansionist, imperial security state that finds new enemies abroad, new
obstacles to its endless expansion, thereby solving]{.underline}**
(albeit only ever temporarily and incompletely) **[the problem of
futurist failure that constituted settlement to begin
with.]{.underline}** This transformation is immediately apparent in
Hobbes's astute psychology of the life of futurist desire. Regarding
desire, Hobbes claims that one seeks not simply "enjoyment" in the
present or "to enjoy once onely, and for one instant of time." Rather,
one seeks "to assure for ever, the way of his future desire."95 If [the
nature of desire is such that we seek to assure satisfaction forever,
indefinitely into the future, then life/desire is inevitably bound up
with anxiety,]{.underline} on the one hand[, and power-
seeking]{.underline}, on the other. Perpetually uncertain about the
prospects of successfully getting what we want, we must continually seek
to enlarge our power in order to secure the objects of our desire. It is
important to note that [this everexpanding sphere of influence
is]{.underline} not the result of a snowballing or addictive sort of
pleasure- seeking behavior, nor is it due to some essential will to
power at the heart of human nature. It is, rather, [simply what is
required in order to preserve the status quo]{.underline}: "It is not
alwayes that a man hopes for a more intensive delight, than he has
already attained to; or that he cannot be content with a moderate power:
but because he cannot assure the power and means to live well, which he
hath present, without the acquisition of more."96 Mere maintenance of
the present, in other words, requires accumulation, undertaken in
perpetual reference to an uncertain future. The successful maintenance
of an indefinite present is, for Hobbes, the content of human happiness:
"Continuall successe in obtaining those things which a man from time to
time desireth, that is to say, continuall prospering, is that men call
Felicity."97 Such felicity is impossible, of course, as Hobbes concedes
in the very next sentence: "I mean the Felicity of this life. For there
is no such thing as perpetuall Tranquillity of mind, while we live here;
because Life itself is but Motion, and can never be without Desire, nor
without Feare, no more than without Sense."98 Hobbes acknowledges, in
other words, that, based on his own futurist accounting of life/desire
and in fact precisely because of it, "happiness" (that is, getting what
you want) is impossible. Even supposing one were able to secure the
requisite amount of power necessary to maintain the status quo, such an
(impossible) achievement would mean that our desire would be satisfied,
and therefore extinguished. It would mean, in other words, no longer
being alive, since "to have no desire is to be dead."99 As he explains,
To which we are to consider, that the Felicity of this life, consisteth
not in the repose of a mind satisfied. For there is no such Finis
ultimus, (utmost ayme,) nor Summum Bonum, (greatest Good,) as is spoken
of in the Books of the old Morall Philosophers. Nor can a man any more
live, whose Desires are at an end, than he, whose Senses and
Imaginations are at a stand. Felicity is a continuall progress of the
desire, from one object to another; the attaining of the former, being
still but the way to the later.100 Suggesting that (attainment of) the
highest good of Aristotelian ethics is itself a kind of stasis or death,
Hobbes plainly rejects the idea that the endless motion that
characterizes human life could come to a halt in some fashion that does
not entail death. Understood psychologically, he is making clear that
human happiness--- the only kind available to us in "this life"--- means
never actually being satisfied. [The perpetuity of enjoyment at which
desire aims is a consumption that is never, can never fully be (allowed
to be) complete(d]{.underline}). Hobbes's specifically futurist and
expansionist understanding of desire makes clear that, rather than
confront the impossibility of security, happiness, and immortality, he
instead offers the commonwealth and an everexpanding pursuit of power as
a substitutive satisfaction. In other words, he both institutes life and
pushes it forward via a futurist narrativization of endeavor into an
insatiable, accumulative desire. Rather than face the founding violence
that brought peace and "life itself" into being, Hobbes instead
naturalizes this act by declaring it to be "a generall inclination of
all mankind" to engage in "a perpetuall and restlesse desire of Power
after power, that ceaseth onely in Death."101 Yet [while desire may push
us ever forward, ever beyond the initial moments of settlement, it
cannot erase that settlement or relieve settler sovereignty of the
burden of conquest.]{.underline} This is [neither because of settler
colonialism's theoretical definition nor because settlers secretly feel
guilty about conquest, but rather because of the impossibility of
fulfilling futurism's fantastical promises.]{.underline} [Empire
functions as a kind of substitutive satisfaction to compensate for the
failure of settler sovereignty to finally and fully exterminate
indigenous peoples]{.underline}. The **[pleasures of endless imperial
expansion]{.underline}**--- [the restless desire of "power after power"
in an attempt to secure the future, once and for all]{.underline}---
**[relieve the burden of the failed "completion" of the settler colonial
project]{.underline}** and the impossible promise of happiness. [Empire
is thus the settler impulse turned outward]{.underline}. It is a salve
for settlement in its promise of an impossible, if now- externalized,
future happiness and security.102 Built into Hobbes's understanding of
desire, then (and, therefore, the Commonwealth), is the failed teleology
of futurism, which, as Edelman instructs, is fundamentally and futilely
political. The reason the commonwealth cannot alleviate the anxiety that
runs apace with desire is because it cannot eliminate the foundations of
its existence and the basis of its regime: on the one hand, indigenous
removal and dispossession; on the other, the futurist constitution of
"life" and/as desire. [Indigenous removal and dispossession are
accomplished, therefore, not only via the exertion of violence,
domination, war, famine, genocide, and disease, but also via a
specifically ideological imposition of the meaning of "life" and "death"
that requires an indigenous removal and dispossession that it cannot
accomplish without killing itself.]{.underline} [This]{.underline}
intractable dilemma [explains the transformation of settler societies
into security states, which reformulates the indigenous threat of
"savagery" and death into external, terroristic opponents of its "way of
life."]{.underline} As Jodi Byrd observes, "[**Indianness becomes a site
through which U.S. empire orients and replicates itself** by
**transforming those to be colonized into 'Indians'** **through
continual reiterations of pioneer logics**, whether **in** the Pacific,
the Caribbean, or **the Middle East**."]{.underline}103
[Empire]{.underline}, in other words, [relocates the state of nature
from the domain of the indigenous "savage" to the "wilderness"
abroad,]{.underline} [itself in need of taming and civilizing if life
and its value are to be satisfactorily protected]{.underline}. Twenty-
first- century [empire]{.underline} [is]{.underline} thus
[legible]{.underline}, as Byrd and others have argued, [as an outgrowth
of the settlement of the United States and a contemporary episode of its
ongoing structure]{.underline}.104 Stephen Silliman has documented [the
US military's usage of "Indian country" to describe Iraq and Afghanistan
in the War on Terror.]{.underline} While the Revolutionary War or Civil
War possess just as much "resonance in the psyche of the United States
as wars for freedom, unity, and democracy," nevertheless "[soldiers in
the Middle East draw on the 'Indian wars' of the 19th century to inform
their daily experiences in combat]{.underline}."105 Silliman argues that
"[The efficacy of this metaphor relies not in the accuracy of the
historical or cultural details . . . but on the believability and
acceptability of them as part of a narrative of conquest and nation
building.]{.underline}"106 The "Indian country" characterization serves,
in other words, to naturalize the "success" of the conquest of North
America by casting contemporary US empire as an inevitably victorious,
if now- worldwide, battle against "savagery," this time in the form of
Islam and "terrorism." Of George W. Bush's expressed desire to "smoke"
Osama Bin Laden "out of his cave," for example, Alex Lubin writes, The
invocation of the Western drama of settler colonialism has always
animated American thinking about and activity in the Middle East, and
Bush is merely tapping into a well of affective politics that links the
United States to the Middle East as well as provides support for
increased surveillance and the suspension of rights domestically. Yet,
in the contemporary era of neoliberal globalization, the United States'
comparative rendering of the Middle East through its own settler
colonial past has been multiplied and transformed into a "global war on
terror." That is, the United States' unparalleled superpower status
enables it to universalize and globalize its comparative politics into a
global "clash of civilizations."107 Simultaneously, then, as the
"terrorist" obstacles to empire become projected versions of Indians,
Indians become retroactively legible as the first or foundational
examples of "terrorism." Of the Declaration of Independence, for
example, which complains that King George "has endeavored to bring on
the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose
known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages,
sexes, and conditions," Byrd observes, The non- discriminating, proto-
inclusive "merciless Indian Savage" stands as the terrorist,
externalized from "our frontiers," and functions as abjected horror
through whom civilization is articulated oppositionally. This non-
recuperative category, a derealization of the Other, serves as a
paranoid foundation for what Jasbir K. Puar defines in Terrorist
Assemblages as Islamic "monster- terrorist- fags," the affectively
produced and queered West Asian (including South Asian, Arab American,
and Muslim) body that is targeted for surveillance and destruction by
U.S. patriotic pathology.108 The "terrorist" of today, the contemporary
obstacle to empire, is the native of an alleged "yesterday," the archaic
obstacle to settlement. Whether in the domain of conquest or empire,
however, [the failed futurism of settler colonial sovereignty produces
abjected queer repositories of death that stand as a threat to the
civilized life of the settler society]{.underline}.109 Their
interconnection is crucial; the logic that connects them continuous.
Unsurprisingly, then, Hobbes's political theory serves as a
justification for what it claimed only to describe. While an unmarked
[self- preservation and fear of death have typically been taken to be
the natural and logical preconditions of the sovereign
politics]{.underline} Hobbes institutes in Leviathan, an Edelmanian
approach to this text [reveals them to be the premier values settler
sovereignty ideologically seeks retroactively to (re)produce and
uphold]{.underline}. What this means, then, is that Hobbes's entire
state of nature story is an anachronism. Like all origin stories, it is
fundamentally ideological and offered primarily in order to legitimate
an already- existing political order and the political commitment of its
storyteller.110 The particular agenda being naturalized in Hobbes's
biopolitical story of [the state of nature is settler conquest, and its
futurist determination is the reason why he cannot decide when and where
it is, and also why settler colonial societies seek constantly to erase
themselves as settler societies.]{.underline}111 The [insecurity lodged
at the heart of settler colonialism's futurist desire renders
satisfaction impossible, an impossibility that remains unacknowledged
and is instead foisted onto those "savages" who refuse collaboration
with its ideological ruses]{.underline}. Leviathan is thus a settler
colonial text par excellence. Like Agamben in this regard, it is a
rationalization of empire that ignores all those queered by its
machinations. Unlike Agamben, however, it makes explicit the connection
between the biopolitics of settler colonialism and that of contemporary
empire, revealing the futurist temporality that links them together and
renders them continuous projects

#### Decisions over changes in weapons transfers are a product of a settler colonial desire to establish militaristic control over state formation overseas

\*ATT = UN Arms Trade Treaty

**Stavrianakis 19** (Stavrianakis, Anna. "Controlling Weapons
Circulation in a Postcolonial Militarised World." Review of
International Studies, vol. 45, no. 1, 2019, pp. 57--76.,

International Relations at the University of Sussex. Her main research
interests are NGOs and global civil society; the arms trade and military
globalisation; and critical approaches to the study of international
security) //bc

A third understanding of the ATT's purpose is based on sovereignty: the
concern that the treaty may hamper states' ability to import weapons and
transfer them as they see fit. This account was primarily articulated by
Southern states, often with nationalised military industries. These
include growing military producers such as China and Brazil; major
importers such as India; regional antagonists such as Egypt, Israel,
Pakistan and India; leftist Latin American states such as Venezuela and
Cuba; and the three states that voted against the treaty, North Korea,
Iran, and Syria. [Sovereignty was also a strong theme of the US
position]{.underline}, however: [**weapons transfers are a 'sovereign
decision' premised on state's right to engage in foreign policy as it
sees fit**, and its opposition to any overarching authority being able
to tell states how to interpret the treaty]{.underline}.70 In this
account, **[there is emphasis on states' legitimate interests in trading
materiel, equipment, and technology for political, security, economic
and commercial reasons]{.underline}**. The human security, political
economy and [sovereignty orientations towards the control of weapons
circulation]{.underline} [demonstrate some of the variety of forms of
militarism in the contemporary world.]{.underline} They do not map
directly on to existing types but, as Mabee and Vucetic explain, [this
empirical diversity helps us to move away from primarily statist
conceptualisations of militarism.]{.underline}71 Human security can be
well described as an expression of liberal militarism, which features
justifications for the use of force based on values and morals,
accompanied by the use of law to legitimise it[; a strong commitment to
military production across war -- and peacetime; and a capital -- and
technology-intensive orientation to war preparation]{.underline}.72
Human security is thus organically linked to particular conceptions of
political economy -- as evidenced by the ostensible compatibility
between the promotion of arms exports and support for human security as
articulated by some states, noted above. [Sovereigntist orientations
towards the ATT are well encapsulated by the concept of nationstate
militarism, often but not always authoritarian in form]{.underline}.
Again, this has political economic dimensions -- [the 'state-led
economic and social mobilization of "destructive" forces' 73 of
nationstate militarism is reflected in the state ownership and direction
of the arms industry in many states articulating a sovereigntist account
of the treat]{.underline}y, [and in the US position, where industry is
formally private but arms exports are a matter of state
polic]{.underline}y. Often deemed retrograde, [nationstate militarism
'consistently reasserts itself and needs to be accounted
for']{.underline}. 74 [Its persistence should be read as a means of
agency under conditions of hierarchy: in an officially equal but
substantively unequal international system]{.underline}, **[marked by
the ongoing legacies of colonial rule and contemporary practices of
state formation and internal colonisation,]{.underline}** the enduring
power of sovereignty continues to occlude North--South relations,
whether articulated by the US or states of the global South

#### The AFF's reduction of arms and policy pursues the building of grand colonial empires to fight over alliances and secure markets while exploiting its subjects. The Settler arbitrarily supplies arms to the elites of its colonies while ending arm trades where the imperial empire has not settled wearing the mask of a peacemaker only to keep the native forever subordinate.

However[, focusing only on the operation of prohibitory regulatory norms
obscures the way arms trade regulation also constituted a specific
colonial form of *arms control as governmentality*, whereby mechanisms
of prohibition *and* prescription were *both* put to the service of
governing which peoples could legitimately use what kinds of
arms.]{.underline} Of course, [efforts to manage arms flows to
potentially unruly colonial subjects by constantly seeking to balance
permission and proscription were neither completely effective nor ever
effectively complete.]{.underline} First, efforts at restraint were
perennially subject to strategies of evasion undertaken by local actors
operating with their own normative and cartographic understandings
(Tagliacozzo 2005; Mathew 2016). Second, [arms trade regulation was a
contested terrain over which advocates of permission and advocates of
restraint often clashed.]{.underline} For example, pressures for
restraint were offset by pressures to [use the provision of arms to
secure access to markets and the loyalty or security of allies in a
context of intra-European competition to maintain and expand formal and
informal empires]{.underline} (Grant 2007; Chew 2012).
[Policy]{.underline} on the ground, therefore, often [appeared
contradictory]{.underline}. Nevertheless[, proponents of
permission]{.underline} and proscription g[enerally agreed on the broad
goals of policy---to maintain imperial influence and imperial
order.]{.underline} As will be illustrated below, they agreed even more
on the broader logics in which arguments for [permission and
proscription were to be located---those governing sovereignty, free
trade, development, and the standard of civilization]{.underline}. For
example, the Brussels Act certainly failed to pre- vent a substantial
arms trade into Abyssinia and Somalia where, by 1908, British officials
considered the act had "completely broken down"29 largely as a result of
French support for a profitable arms trade through French-controlled
Djibouti. [In this case]{.underline}, [colonial norms of sovereignty
provided the regulatory space for proliferation]{.underline}. The legal
legitimacy of this transit trade was enshrined by Article Ten of the
Brussels Act, which, some- what ironically, had been vigorously promoted
by the British. This affirmed the right of inland territories "under the
sovereignty or protectorate" of another signatory power to acquire arms
via the territory of a coastal power, and Italy had previously announced
Abyssinia's adhesion to the agreement. Compounding the irony, at one
point in the negotiations the French had suggested the conference had
"no power to impose a right of transit on any Sovereign state."30
Enforcement of both the arms and slave trade regulations of Brussels was
also hampered by French refusal to permit searches of sea vessels flying
the French flag. **[Arms smuggling dhow owners operating in both the Red
Sea and the Persian Gulf quickly realized the French flag represented "a
license to traffic"]{.underline}** (Mathew 2016, 35), [**as it made each
dhow an "island of colonial sovereignty**"]{.underline} (ibid., 34) and
therefore immune to search. This is not to imply sovereignty norms
offered an unfettered license to trade. [The arms provisions of the
Brussels Act were ultimately predicated on the fact that European powers
exercised "rights of sovereignty" (Article Nine) in their colonial
possessions. Thus, the act and its implementation were suffused with
norms of sovereignty that both underpinned restrictions on the arms
trade and provided the regulatory spaces permitting their
circumvention.]{.underline} Similarly, both the advocates for free trade
in arms in the spaces of empire and the advocates of restriction crafted
their arguments by reference to the shared ideational frames of free
trade, development, and the standard of civilization---each heavily
imbricated in the other. In Africa, for example, free trade advocates
argued the offer of arms was essential for recruiting African la- borers
and that arms proliferation would speed the de- population of local
wildlife, thus hastening [the day when natives switched from hunting and
alcohol to legitimate trade]{.underline} (Storey 2008, 196). Conversely,
proponents of restriction such as Alexander [Mackay]{.underline} (1890,
42) of the Church Missionary Society [deplored the fact that "in the
name of Christianity, free trade and civilization we see firewater and
firearms pouring in every port]{.underline} [\[in Africa\]." However,
for Mackay, the solution lay not only in "forbidding the import of arms
and ammunition" but in pro- peace" so "the natives will . . . busy
themselves with growing whatever they can get a fair price for instead
of fighting"]{.underline} (Letter to *The Times*, May 8, 1889). In this
sense, the Brussels Act [represented the archetype of regulation in the
spaces of empire, combining restrictions on the arms]{.underline} and
liquor [trades]{.underline} with calls for the development of
"agricultural labour and . . . the industrial arts" [amongst native
populations]{.underline} (Article Two). At the same time, the precise
ways in which these twin processes of grafting and counter-grafting
played out varied from region to region and over time. For example, in
Singapore, policy from the 1820s onwards oscillated between permission
and proscription, as free trade and merchant pressure on the one hand
and concerns about the destabilizing impact of the firearms trade on the
other hand were weighed in different ways at different times
(Tagliacozzo 2005, 270; Chew 2012, 174--79). At Muscat, commercial
treaties between the sultan and various powers (particularly the French)
enshrining free trade severely hampered Britain's ability to curtail the
trade in the Persian Gulf. This was only finally resolved by the
aforementioned 1913 agreement between Britain and France. Thus, free
trade norms were constantly exposed to serial processes of grafting and
counter-grafting. [Nevertheless, as the nineteenth century merged into
the early twentieth century, arms trade regulation in the spaces of
empire was increasingly seen as consonant with a dominant imaginary of
liberal market norms]{.underline} (Mathew 2016). This is not to downplay
[the pressures for imperial powers to supply arms to local allies, or
the way broader colonial conceptions of economic and geostrategic
interest militated against cooperation to limit the arms traffic as at
Djibouti and Muscat]{.underline}.31 However, **[such factors ultimately
illustrate the way in which particular assemblages of norms, formal and
informal practices, responses to evasions, and norm-derived conceptions
of interest constituted colonial practices of arms control as
governmentality.]{.underline}** Understood in this way, [oscillations in
**policy** in the same region or between different spheres of colonial
interest reflected the **attempt** (always imperfect) **to manage arms
flows** according **to where people were placed in the racially
inflected triple hierarchies** of civilization, loyalty, and utility to
imperial power---hierarchies that could be either mutually reinforcing
or mutually opposed depending on circumstance. Pressures to arm or
disarm locals also illustrated how judgements about what constituted
interest were predicated on a particular moral economy]{.underline}
(8908), 1906. in which European [norms of racial superiority and
imperialism framed the standards]{.underline} of appropriate behavior of
the era (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998, 892) [and the fluid but always
subordinate identities of the other. **The centrality of European racial
and imperial norms in arms governance was illustrated in the late 1870s
when the Cape Colony in Southern Africa introduced a licensing system
aimed at disarming supposedly disloyal native tribes**]{.underline}
(Storey 2004, 707). In response[, one tribe, the Basuto, proclaimed
their loyalty to the Queen and asked whether "we are to be disarmed
because we are black."]{.underline}32 [In British India, Acts in 1858,
1860, 1878, and 1909 constantly refined and revised who had the right to
own, import, export, and produce what kinds of arms, where they could be
transferred to, and under what conditions.]{.underline} Each act was
also regularly amended via a series of notifications that led one
official reviewing rules on exports to Aden to lament "it is impossible
to say . . . with absolute certainty what are now the precise powers of
the Government of India under the \[1878\] Arms Act."33 **[This
illustrates how such regulations were not just about the effective
management of arms flows but also an intrinsic part of the process by
which imperial gradations of race, culture, and threat were actually
produced.]{.underline}** Indeed, in this context, the performative of
adherence to, and refinement of, regulatory processes was as important
as actually achieving a concrete impact on arms flows.

A brief survey of these civilizational discourses demonstrates that
there is a great deal of ambivalence among scholars regarding the
particular conditions that gave rise to particular civilizational
identities and the specific criteria deployed to judge the Other as
civilized or not. Katzenstein merely suggests that technological
differences serve as a key consideration and Huntington and Cox express
concern about weapons proliferation and the military supremacy of the
West. Furthermore, Huntington's understanding of [[a civilizational
paradigm]{.mark} is very simplistic in [its understanding of power as an
exercise of domination and subordination through its arms
buildup]{.mark} versus hold-down strategy.]{.underline} It is eclectic
and superficial in its illustration of difficulties experienced in
negotiating particular arms control and disarmament regimes. [[It
pretends to be futuristic while being judgemental]{.mark} in its
declaration that 'the United States and the West remained committed to a
hold-down policy which]{.underline}, in the end, [is bound to
fail']{.underline}.49 The efforts by Huntington and Katzenstein to
articulate the possibility of a universal civilization or a plural
civilization based on modernity are interesting but there is lack of any
serious consideration of the possibilities and limits of generating a
universally shared language and addressing the problems of technological
differences that are crucial to practices of arms control and
disarmament. In this context, Cox's cautionary notes on the illusions of
universality and the need for empathy in inter-civilizational dialogue
serve as useful reminders in problematizing practices of arms control
and disarmament as civilizational practices. Several critiques of these
civilizational discourses are available but none seeks to question the
deployment of a 'civilizational paradigm' to address the problem of arms
control and disarmament. It is this very silence in the arms control and
disarmament community that serves as a provocation to undertake this
study with the help of critical studies and postcolonial scholarship on
arms control and disarmament. This very small community of scholars is
empathetic towards the need for a more rigorous historical analysis of
practices of arms control and disarmament and is very critical of the
state-centric structure of the international system. But this
scholarship too has failed to seize the opportunity presented in the
form of civilization discourses that subsume the sovereign state system
to project civilization as the overwhelming identity that leads to
confrontation on weapons issues and will be the source of
inter-civilizational conflict. The postcolonial scholarship has not
addressed the problem of weapons significantly but has taken issue with
civilizational bias in security studies more generally. But the
commitment of both these approaches towards articulating the concerns of
the marginalized and questioning hegemonic practices makes them suitable
for articulating a critique of civilization discourses in the context of
weapons. It is therefore contributions from both critical security
studies and postcolonial studies that are deployed to undertake a
further critique of civilization discourses in the context of arms
control and disarmament. There is a growing consciousness among critical
security studies scholars of a ['Western security culture']{.underline}
that [has 'powerfully shaped the NACD]{.underline} (Nuclear Arms Control
and Disarmament) [policies and practices of states, and helped to define
what it means for states to pursue their national
interests'.]{.underline}50 These scholars question the development of
security studies in its 'modern form' as an attempt to represent itself
as a 'seemingly neutral and timeless language of social science'.51
Barkawi and Laffey argue that [the Western right to bear arms and use
force is 'legitimated in terms of a civilizing mission]{.underline} of
one kind or another \... the assumption is that [**[it is the right of
the West to bear arms to liberate the "natives."]{.mark}** [This]{.mark}
is and [always has been **the primary justification for
imperialism**]{.mark} in all its forms; it is about **[civilizing the
barbarians']{.mark}.**]{.underline}52 A further claim is made that
'conventional security studies rests on and reproduces Eurocentric
histories and geographies of world politics'.53 It is important to note
that [Eurocentric accounts of great power competition [tend to take
the]{.mark}]{.underline} weak -- the [['natives']{.underline}]{.mark},
the colonies, the periphery, the Third World, the global South -- more
or less [[for granted]{.mark}.]{.underline} [They do so in the specific
sense]{.underline} that agency, rationality, power and morality, [as
well as the fundamental dynamics of the world order, are assumed to
reside in the global North.]{.underline} Alternatively, these various
others are assumed to be just like us, only weaker. This generates a
different problem, inasmuch as **[[it denies their own history, their
difference]{.underline}]{.mark}**.54 Barkawi and Laffy identify two key
problems with a Eurocentric framework of analysis for security studies:
First, as we have noted, questions of war and peace raised by great
power competition are foundational for security thought and practice. As
a result security studies provides few categories for making sense of
the historical experiences of the weak and the powerless who comprise
most of the world's population. By default these experiences are
conceived in categories derived from great power politics in the North
\... Second, and related, to the extent that it addresses them at all,
[a Eurocentric security studies [regards the weak and the powerless as
marginal and derivative elements of world politics]{.mark}]{.underline},
as at best the site of good liberal intentions or at worst a potential
source of threats. Missed are the multiple and integral relations
between the weak and the strong. Failing to study the weak and the
strong together, as jointly responsible for making history, hamstrings
IR and security studies ability to make sense of the world politics
generally and North --South relations in particular.55 [This framework
of analysis also [insists]{.mark} on a standard manoeuvre [towards
'othering mass slaughter from the West and from modernity]{.mark}. It
serves to [preserve]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} in the face of any
evidence to the contrary, [[the ethical character of the
West]{.underline}]{.mark} and, in turn, [[underpins claims]{.mark} in
liberal and security studies [that the West is a force for the good in
the world']{.mark}.]{.underline}56 According to Barkawi and Laffey,
'conventional security studies as a field of knowledge is a product of
Western power'. As a result, it \... produces basic difficulties in
understanding the course and nature of events, that is, in empirical
analyses, of security studies. [Whether we wish to understand crisis
decision-making or the cause of genocide, adopting a Eurocentric set of
assumptions -- about agency, objectivity, and morality -- gets in the
way and hinders our efforts.]{.underline} Second, Eurocentrism in
security studies also means that analysis winds up expressing a taken
for granted politics that sides with the rulers, with the powerful, with
the imperialists, and not with the downtrodden, the weak, the colonized
or the post-colonised \... This means there is both a social science
problem and a political problem. 57

#### Colonies are necessary for the development of arms used for colonial wars, and the fear of a native uprising causes the subordination of natives by denying access to arms that they produce

First Phase: [Colonial Racism in Practices of Arms Control and
Disarmament]{.underline} It is argued that from the late 18th century,
[[the ideology of laissez faire in arms governed Western
powers]{.underline}]{.mark}. According to this ideology, \... [trade is
seen as the source of wealth and power and the engine of growth for
sustained and enhanced productive capacity]{.underline}; this would
logically result in fewer direct restrictions on arms transfers. A shift
to indirect political intervention in the market also follows from this,
and objections to the trade in technology may even diminish, as long as
the wellsprings of technological innovation are not directly threatened.
58 One might very well question how this sense of threat emerged among
the Western powers. [The [possession of colonies]{.mark} among the
Western powers [represented a source of wealth and
power]{.mark}.]{.underline} This very possession generated a sense of
vulnerability. **[The [colonies provided the raw materials necessary
fo]{.mark}r the production of [weapons]{.mark} and soldiers [to fight
imperial wars]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Thus, [there was a sense of
**[fear that transfer of arms to the colonies might result in their use
against the colonial masters]{.mark}**]{.underline}**.** **[A serious
sense of [threat governed all imperial decisions, including transfer of
arms,]{.mark} with regard to maintaining control over the
colonies.]{.underline}** Thus, the argument on 'free trade' in arms did
not extend to the colonies lacking freedom. To further protect the 'well
springs of technological innovation' education, [fundamental research in
sciences or development of indigenous scientific capabilities were
deliberately discouraged in the colonies.]{.underline}59
[This]{.underline}, according to Albert Memmi, [can be attributed to
'colonial racism'.]{.underline}60 The [practices of [colonial
racism]{.mark} deliberately emphasize and [exploit the differences
between the colonized and the colonizers.]{.mark} They further [seek to
sustain these differences]{.mark}, [transforming]{.mark} them
[into]{.mark} irrefutable standards of [fact]{.mark} that correspond
with concrete realities to the benefit of the colonial
powers.]{.underline} It was these explicit practices of [colonial
racism]{.underline} that [made it impossible for the colonized to
cultivate any taste for 'mechanized civilization and a feeling for
machinery'.]{.underline}61 A sense of 'technical inadequacy' was
deliberately cultivated as **['[the colonizer pushed the colonized out
of the]{.mark} historical and social, cultural and technical
[current']{.mark}.]{.underline}**62 It was under these circumstances of
a deliberately created sense of technical inadequacy that: [\[w\]hile it
is pardonable for the colonizer to have his]{.underline} little
[arsenals, [the discovery of]{.mark} even a rusty [weapon among the
colonized is cause for]{.mark} immediate
[punishment]{.mark}]{.underline} \... and nostalgia for arms is always
present, and is part of all ceremonies in Africa, from north to south.
The lack of implements of war appears proportional to the size of the
colonialist forces; the most isolated tribes are still the first to pick
up these weapons. This is not a proof of savagery, but only evidence
that the conditioning is not sufficiently maintained.63

[The lack of sovereign status among the colonies served as a hindrance
to their participation in constituting arms control and disarmament
agreements. The colonies were deliberately excluded from participating
in multilateral arms control and disarmament conferences]{.underline}
convened by the European powers. The agreements negotiated in the form
of [the 1868 St Petersburg Declaration, The Hague Conferences in 1899
and 1907 and the Geneva Protocol of 1925 were considered to be
agreements among the civilized, based on the opinions of the civilized,
and since one of the conditions of being civilized was recognition of
sovereign status, these agreements excluded the Others.]{.underline}66
While the St Petersburg Declaration 'prohibited the use of certain
projectiles among civilized nations', the Geneva Protocol emphasized how
'the general opinion of the civilized world' had 'justly condemned \...
the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases'.67

#### The Settler uses arms reduction as a means to control the channel and flow of violence subsequently re-enforcing its violent nature upon foreign domestic conflict.

Governmentality",
<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13523260.2011.556823> //RC)

The notion of a shift from a sovereign to a governmental form of power
draws upon Michel Foucault's analysis of the emergence, in the 16th and
17th centuries, of government and [governing as the way in which state
power over its population was exercised,]{.underline} as opposed to
cruder, more direct, exercises of unlimited and/or arbitrary sovereign
power.4 [Sovereignty]{.underline} and governmentality are thus two
distinct modes of exercising power that either [focus on securing a
given territory and system of rule over a people]{.underline}
(sovereignty) or on managing a population through the wide-ranging
regulation of economy and society (governmentality).5 [Applying these
concepts, designed to help understand the changing exercise of state
power, to the international arena]{.underline} is not without some
challenges. In the international arena, sovereign rule is about
negotiated and strategic (in the instrumentally-rational sense)
relations between recognized equals, whereas [governmental rule involves
hierarchical relations, the effacing of the domestic-international
divide, and a complex set of relationships between states, international
organizations and transnational civil society]{.underline}.6 It is not
my intention, however, to provide a full theoretical exploration of
these concepts, but rather to use them as a window through which I can
shine new light on the changing practices of arms control (and perhaps
international security more broadly). In the first part of this article,
I focus on [the underlying elements of the larger historical process of
controlling arms, understood as a technology of social and political
control, and as a **set of institutional practices designed to manage
and channel the use of violence both within and between
states.**]{.underline} I will then look at the way in which the Cold War
arms control paradigm represented both a shift in, and a continuity with
this historical experience by highlighting the underlying principles
that governed the Cold War arms control paradigm and its related
practices and practical manifestations. Despite some elements of
continuity with previous practices[, by representing itself as a set
**of instrumentally-rational techniques for managing conflict, arms
control**]{.underline} throughout the Cold War normalized [a particular
set of practices as one (or the only) proper way of dealing with what
**was a subset of the larger issue of how to 'control and regulate the
possession and use of the means of violence' in social and political
relations.**]{.underline}7

#### The principle to choose at will who can and cannot possess weapons reinforces settler logic on the premise of who has the right to autonomy and who doesn't. The regulation of lethal violence is set upon the settler's ability to exploit or manage territories and populations to meet their own agenda.

How, if at all, is this [relevant to 21st century challenges of
controlling the possession and use of the means of
violence]{.underline}? Viewed narrowly as a policy-relevant and
[technocratic means of regulating military competition between states to
minimize the risk of accidental violent conflict (or to reduce the
overall risk of conflict),]{.underline} the [arms control
paradigm]{.underline} is intellectually, although not necessarily
practically or politically, [exhausted]{.underline}. There remains much
practical negotiation and work to be done on such things as a fissile
material cut off treaty, further reductions in the American and Russian
nuclear arsenals (especially of tactical nuclear weapons), and efforts
to maintain the somewhat shaky edifice of nuclear non-proliferation.
Other initiatives, [such as restrictions on the weaponization of space,
or on ballistic missile defenses, seem less relevant to 21st century
geopolitical realities, in which the risk of inter-state war is
relatively minor, while the risk of large-scale intra-state and
non-state violence remains.]{.underline} What the complete paralysis of
the Geneva-based Conference on Disarmament and the non-events of the
past two decades (since the signing of the Chemical Weapons Convention
in 1993) have highlighted is the way in which arms control as narrowly
conceived was a product of particular geopolitical conditions and
pressup- positions that gave rise to certain kinds of multilateral
measures, based on shared understandings of the significance of
stability and balance, transparency, equality, hierarchy, and the
technological potential of nuclear weapons. All of these under-
standings have been challenged in different ways by states such as
India, Pakistan, China, Egypt, North Korea, or Iran, often for reasons
of national or strategic interests, but also because they reject the way
in which [**traditional arms control practices reinforced** and
legitimated **particular sovereign understandings of who could** **(and
could not) possess, use, or threaten to use, particular
weapon**s.]{.underline}30 But I argue that [arms control practices can
also be viewed more broadly through the lens of
governmentality.]{.underline}31 To begin, the [regulation of and control
over the use of lethal violence was not, since the early 20th century,
just about inter-state military competition. It was also about a set of
social and institutional practices that imposed certain understandings
about the rules for the use of force in international society, that
reinforced the state's monopoly of legitimate use of force both
internally and externally, and that manifest themselves through
particular forms of management of a given territory, population and
resources.]{.underline} Thus, even though some of the new frontiers of
contemporary arms control do not have the same practical manifestations
or targets, nor even the same actors engaged in [**promoting arms
control**, t]{.underline}hey **[can be understood as sharing the same
premises about state power and violence.]{.underline}** On this broader
account, one could [redefine arms control as being about who can
possess, use, develop and transfer the technologies of violence, under
what circumstances, against whom, and for what ends?]{.underline} And
the (critical) scholarly question is then: what are the consequences and
effects of the legitimization of particular configurations and
distributions of technologies of violence? In this light, a wide range
of contemporary international practices, include such things as the bans
on anti-personnel landmines and cluster munitions, post-conflict weapons
collection and destruction efforts, [disarmament, demobilization and
reintegration programmes (DDR), and security sector reform (SSR)
initiatives all can be considered as new manifestations of arms control
as governmentality.]{.underline} Some have argued that these types of
measures reflect [a shift towards humanitarian disarmament, or
'disarmament as humanitarian action', and aim to reclaim the disarmament
side of the arms-control and disarmament divide.]{.underline}32 I would
argue, however, that despite some significant differences in focus and
targets, there [is a great deal of continuity with the logic of
governmentality]{.underline} that emerged in the latter stages of Cold
War arms control practices.

#### Colonized space can never be peacefully autonomous once it has been dragged out of its peripheries, since colonial powers structurally deny its subjects access to their own conditions, leaving them with a moral-mythical foundation on which build their policy and apology.

//RC)

The golden age of a nation-state\'s memory proved to be neither pure nor
just, nor even available, but a utopian dream often turned into a bloody
nightmare. [The hatred of the oppressors was enough to mobilize toward
liberation but was inadequate for the management of an independent
state]{.underline}. As Fanon had predicted early in the game, [attempts
at nativism indeed ended in disastrous corruption and self-destruction,
and they are still ongoing events in many parts of the world. Once
absorbed into the \"chrono politics\" of the secular West, colonized
space cannot reclaim autonomy and seclusion; once dragged out of their
precolonial state, the indigenes of peripheries have to deal with the
knowledge of the outside world, irrespective of their own wishes and
inclinations. And yet the conditions of the modern nation-state are not
available to most former colonies.]{.underline}10 One recalls that
[Western industrialized nations had the luxury of several
centuries-however bloody-to resolve civil strife's, religious wars, and
rural/urban or agricultural/industrial contradictions. Former colonies
had far less time to work them out, and they had been under the
domination of alien powers. Thus, most former colonies have yet to agree
on the logic and objective of a geographic and demographic unit. The
will to fragmentation battles with the will to totalization. One cannot
forget that there were countless cases of overt and covert interventions
by the United States and other colonial powers through economic,
political, and arms.]{.underline} [Peaceful progress has been
structurally denied to them]{.underline}. Alliances among Third World
states against First World domination, such as the Bandung Conference
(1955), the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC, 1960),
UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD, 1964), and the New
International Economic Order (NIEO, 1974), have all performed poorly,
ultimately surrendering to the Bretton Woods system, which the
victorious West established in 1944 for the post- war management of the
ruined world with the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as the three central
economic instruments. [It is widely agreed that the nation-state is a
modern Western construction. It can be further argued that the gradual
ascendancy of the nation-state around 1800 in the West was a function of
colonialism. Earlier at the beginning of the modern period, the European
monarchs sponsored adventurist projects, which were further propelled
thereafter by the bourgeoisie\'s greater need for markets and resources
to form a policy of colonial expansion.]{.underline} About the same
time, as the industrial revolution increased production efficiency,
urban areas received the influx of a large percentage of agricultural
labor, creating a pool of surplus population.\" These potentially
rebellious unemployed and displaced workers needed to be depressurized
in the marginal areas of the labor market. [Toward that end, the
organizers of colonialism had to persuade their recruits and foo
soldiers about the profitability as well as the nobility of their
mission]{.underline}. [Voyaging into distant and savage regions of the
world was frightening enough, and the prospects of sharing the loot were
far from assured. Above all, bourgeois leaders had to conceal their
class interests, which sharply conflicted with the interests of the
populace at large. They needed crusader and supporters who trusted their
good faith, believed in the morality of their mission, and hoped for the
eventual wealth promised for them. Thus they made the myth of the
nation-state (that is, the belief in the shared community ruled by a
representative government) and the myth of mission Civilis trice (that
is, the voyagers\' racial superiority over the heathen barbarians) seem
complementary and indispensable]{.underline}. In such an \"imagined \[or
manufactured\] community,\" the citizens were bound by kinship and
communality; they were in it together.\'2 [In the very idea of the
nation- state, the colonialists found a politico economical as well as
moral-mythical foundation on which to build their policy and apology.
Thus, the development of Western colonialism from the sixteenth to the
midtwentieth century coincides with the rise and fall of the nation-
state. The fate of the nation-state in recent years, however, is not
synonymous with the \"rise and fall of the great powers]{.underline},\"
as Paul Kennedy argues.[\'\" The bourgeois capitals in the
industrialized world are now as powerful, or even far more powerful,
than before. But the logic they employ, the clients they serve, the
tools available to them, the sites they occupy, in short, their very
identities, have all changed. They no longer wholly depend on the
nation-state of their origin for protection and facilitation. They still
make use of the nation-state structure, of course, but their power and
energy reside in a different locus, as I will argue later
on.]{.underline}

#### The arms control is a new means of colonialism, means reducing arms is Self-perpetuating or too difficult to sever relations without causing political problems in developing countries.

Not surprisingly, the [developing countries as a whole are]{.underline}
not only [receiving more arms]{.underline}, but also, they are spending
increasing sums on military activities in general. The developing
countries\' share of world military expenditures increased from 15
percent to 22 percent between 1966 and 1975. Unlike the developed
countries, they have devoted a steadily increasing percentage of their
gross national product to military outlays. As a result, they are now
spending a greater proportion of their GNPs for military purposes than
are the developed nations. This growing diversion of scarce resources is
bound to retard the pace of economic development that third world
spokesmen have widely enunciated as their highest priority. [More
disturbing than the quantitative growth has been the increasing
sophistication and destructive power of the weapons transferred to
volatile regions of the world. While the arms-manufacturing countries
once supplied primarily second-hand or obsolete weapons to developing
nations, they have more recently transferred many of their most advanced
conventional weapons to the third world. For instance, the United States
has agreed to sell F-14, F-i5, and F-16 fighters, Lance
surface-to-surface missiles, and Spruance class destroyers to the tense
Middle East. In many cases, the supplier country must also provide large
numbers of advisers, instructors, and maintenance personnel to support
the transfer of highly complex weapons systems. This may **increase the
danger** of directly involving the great powers in local conflicts or
domestic crises. **An unrestrained arms competition** in the third world
would clearly **favor the larger and wealthier countries** and **leave
the poorer states unable to compete** effectively either economically or
militarily. A new class of states, such as Iran and Brazil, is emerging
with the military and economic capacity to influence events well beyond
its members\' borders. As their military power grows and their horizons
expand, they may increasingly behave like regional superpowers, perhaps
policing affairs throughout a region. The **introduction of new** kinds
or large numbers of **weapons** into an already troubled region **may
exacerbate local rivalries** and fuel regional arms races. As one
country begins to build up its arsenal, its neighbors may perceive a
growing threat and may react either by seeking new arms from another
supplier or even by launching a preemptive attack. Unfortunately, it is
difficult for an outside power to evaluate accurately or to manipulate
effectively the security concerns of regional
rivals[.]{.mark}]{.underline} The best way to reinforce regional
security is through multilateral understandings among local countries
and major arms suppliers, rather than unilateral attempts to gain a
favorable short-term military advantage. [**As** the great **powers
become more** directly **involved** in a region through the transfer of
arms and related personnel, **local disputes** may **become polarized**
and assume at least a symbolic importance in the global East-West
struggle. There is always a danger that such a local conflict could
escalate into an East- West military confrontation, particularly if one
of the local client states suffers a serious defeat and calls on its
more powerful benefactor for military assistance. Arms transfer
relationships between particular suppliers and their recipients tend to
become self-perpetuating]{.underline} unless there are political
upheavals within either country. [Once these ties are firmly
established, it is **difficult** **to sever** or even to diminish them
**without causing** major **political problems**.]{.underline} Thus,
officials of the supplier country may expect to gain influence over the
recipient country through arms transfers, but they may soon begin to
question who gains influence over whom. As recent events in Egypt,
Sudan, and Ethiopia illustrate, any apparent influence gained through
arms transfers can be quite transitory. [On the other hand, the
**recipient nation may come to resent** the presence and **activities of
the advisers** and technicians **from the supplying country** and even
con-sider **this a new form of colonialism**. I]{.underline}n many
cases, both [the suppliers]{.underline} and recipients [appear to be
immersed in their own competitions for influence and
security.]{.underline} While arms transfers may seem an attractive
alternative in the short term, it may prove costly or dangerous in the
long run.

#### The Settler State is built in structures of "safeguard" government agents to pass down its inherently violent nature while trying to uphold peace. He practices colonial law with the clear conscience of an upholder of the peace, yet he brings hierarchal violence into the home and into the mind of the native.

[The colonial world is a world cut in two. The dividing line, the
frontiers are shown by barracks and police stations. In the colonies it
is the policeman and the soldier who are the official, instituted
go-betweens, the spokesmen of the settler and his rule of
oppression]{.underline}. In capitalist societies the educational system,
whether lay or clerical, [the **structure of moral reflexes** handed
down from father to son, the exemplary honesty of workers who are given
a medal after fifty years of good and loyal service, and the affection
which springs from harmonious relations and good behavior\--**all these
aesthetic expressions of respect** for the established order serve to
create **around the exploited person** an atmosphere of submission and
of inhibition which **lightens the task of policing
considerably**]{.underline}. In the capitalist countries a multitude of
moral teachers, counselors and \"bewilderers\" separate the exploited
from those in power. [In the colonial countries,]{.underline} on the
contrary, [the policeman and the soldier, by their immediate presence
and their frequent and direct action maintain contact with the native
and advise him by means of rifle butts and napalm not to budge**. It is
obvious here that the agents of government speak the language of pure
force.**]{.underline} The [intermediary does not lighten the
oppression,]{.underline} nor seek to hide the domination; [**he** shows
them up and **puts them into practice** **with the clear conscience of
an upholder of the peace**;]{.underline} [**yet he is the bringer of
violence** into the home and **into the mind of the native**. The zone
where the natives live is not complementary to the zone inhabited by the
settlers. The two zones are opposed, but not in the service of a higher
unity. Obedient to the rules of pure Aristotelian logic, they both
follow the principle of reciprocal exclusivity]{.underline}. No
conciliation is possible, for of the two terms, one is superfluous. [The
settlers\' town is a strongly built town, all made of stone and steel.
It is a brightly lit town; the streets are covered with asphalt, and the
garbage cans swallow all the leavings, unseen, unknown and hardly
thought about. **The settler\'s feet are never visible, except perhaps
in the sea; but there you\'re never close enough to see
them.**]{.underline} [His feet are protected by strong shoes although
the streets of his town are clean and even, with no holes or stones. The
settler\'s town is a well-fed town, an easygoing town]{.underline}; its
belly is always full of good things. [The settlers\' town is a town of
white people, of foreigners. The town belonging to the colonized people,
or at least the native town,]{.underline} t[he Negro village, the
medina, the reservation, is a place of ill fame, peopled by men of evil
repute. They are born there, it matters little where or how; they die
there, it matters not where, nor how.]{.underline} [It is a world
without spaciousness; men live there on top of each other, and their
huts are built one on top of the other. The native town is a hungry
town, starved of bread, of meat, of shoes, of coal, of light. The native
town is a crouching village, a town on its knees, a town wallowing in
the mire.]{.underline} [The look that the native turns on the settler\'s
town is a look of lust, a look of envy; it expresses his dreams of
possession\--all manner of possession: to sit at the settler\'s table,
to sleep in the settler\'s bed]{.underline}. [The colonized man is an
envious man. And this the settler knows very well; when their glances
meet he ascertains bitterly, always on the defensive, \"They want to
take our place.\"]{.underline} It is true, for there is no native who
does not dream at least once a day of setting himself up in the
settler\'s place. [This world divided into compartments, this world
cutin two is inhabited by two different species. The originality of the
colonial context is that economic reality, inequality, and the immense
difference of ways of life never come to mask the human
realities.]{.underline} When you examine at close quarters the colonial
context, [it is evident that what parcels out the world is to begin with
the fact of belonging to or not belonging to a given race, a given
species.]{.underline} In the colonies the economic substructure is also
a superstructure. [The cause is the consequence; you are rich because
you are white, you are white because you are rich]{.underline}. This is
why Marxist analysis should always be slightly stretched every time we
have to do with the colonial problem. Everything up to and including the
very nature of precapitalist society, so well explained by Marx, must
here be thought out again. The serf is in essence different from the
knight, but a reference to divine right is necessary to legitimize this
statutory difference. [In the colonies, the foreigner coming from
another country imposed his rule by means of guns and
machines.]{.underline} In defiance of his successful transplantation, in
**[spite of his appropriation, the settler still remains a
foreigner.]{.underline}** It is neither the act of owning factories, nor
estates, nor a bank balance which distinguishes the governing classes.
[The governing race is first and foremost those who come from elsewhere,
those who are unlike the original inhabitants, \"the others.\" The
violence which has ruled over the ordering of the colonial
world]{.underline}, [which has ceaselessly drummed the rhythm for the
destruction of native social forms and broken up without reserve the
systems of reference of the economy, the customs of dress and external
life, that same violence will be claimed and taken over by the native at
the moment when, deciding to embody history in his own person, he surges
into the forbidden quarters.]{.underline} To wreck the colonial world is
henceforward a mental picture of action which is very clear, very easy
to understand and which may be assumed by each one of the individuals
which constitute the colonized people. To break up the colonial world
does not mean that after the frontiers have been abolished lines of
communication will be set up between the two zones. The destruction of
the colonial world is no more and no less that the abolition of one
zone, its burial in the depths of the earth or its expulsion from the
country. [The natives\' challenge to the colonial world is not a
rational confrontation of points of view.]{.underline} It is not a
treatise on the universal, but the untidy affirmation of an original
idea propounded as an absolute[. The colonial world is a Manichean
world. It is not enough for the settler to delimit physically, that is
to say with the help of the army and the police force, the place of the
native.]{.underline} [As if to show the totalitarian character of
colonial exploitation the settler paints the native as a sort of
quintessence of evil.]{.underline} ^\*^ Native society is not simply
described as a society lacking in values. [It is not enough for the
colonist to affirm that those values have disappeared from, or still
better never existed in, the colonial world.]{.underline} The native is
declared insensible to ethics; he represents not only the absence of
values, but also the negation of values. [He is, let us dare to admit,
the enemy of values, and in this sense he is the absolute evil. He is
the corrosive element, destroying all that comes near him;]{.underline}
[he is the deforming element, disfiguring all that has to do with beauty
or morality; he is the depository of maleficent powers, the unconscious
and irretrievable instrument of blind forces.]{.underline}

Postcolonial studies has been interested in questions that consider how
colonial powers have been able to gain so much control over large parts
of the non-Western world. Postcolonial scholars have documented how
Western culture, ranging broadly from the implementation of colonial
education and languages to the importation of technology, science, and
medicine, has impacted colonized societies. Some argue that colonization
was not all negative; rather, the infrastructure built and maintained by
colonial powers has helped poor regions of the world develop into more
modern and industrialized nations. Other scholars argue that while some
good did come from colonial occupation for some sectors of colonized
societies, [the impact of colonization has been fairly detrimental to
existing indigenous social, economic and political systems]{.underline}.
In particular, [some postcolonial scholars and activists
point]{.underline} [to the question of how "free" ex-colonies can ever
be from their colonizers]{.underline}. That is to say, some scholars
contend that [**new forms of imperialism and domination constitute a
neo-colonialism that includes the spread of global trade**, the
development and aid industries, and military occupations]{.underline}.
Such [neo-colonization has implications along gender, race, and class
lines that impact not only the relationships between the West and the
developing world, but also create new inequalities within ex-colonies
themselves.]{.underline} Contemporary scholars have considered how some
[development projects, intended to modernize former
colonies]{.underline} (also called the "Third World"), **[carry with
them traces of colonial missions]{.underline}**. [Development, or the
transfer of ideas and technologies from developed to underdeveloped
countries**, is intended to help these disadvantaged countries that are
mostly former colonies**]{.underline}. [Postcolonial scholars of
developmen]{.underline}t, such as Arturo Escobar, [have noted that the
era of development began as the era of colonization ended]{.underline}.
**[The driving idea behind development has been based on the assumption
that the rest of the world can follow the same patterns of
industrialization as the West did to become developed]{.underline}**.
The problem, according to Escobar, is that [this assumption ignores the
historical conditions of colonization that have helped create "backward"
conditions within the underdeveloped world]{.underline}. More than that,
[this assumption also does not take into account the unequal economic
and political conditions between the developed world and developing
countries, or the inequalities within nations.]{.underline} As for
ex-colonies such as Haiti, Mexico, and Peru, development has played a
very important role in increasing access to Western medicines and
technologies. Paul Farmer's particular "quest to cure the world" might
be considered by postcolonial scholars as an attempt to develop those
areas of the world that have been the sites of historical and current
imperial struggles, while also giving attention to the specific
conditions that create deep inequality. At the same time, [postcolonial
scholars might contend that there are still legacies of
colonialism]{.underline}, [including the predominance of Western ideas
and science over indigenous or local ideas, that linger in this
particular "quest" as well.]{.underline}

### L - Hegemony

#### Hegemony is a project of settler states to maintain control

the Imperial Response: The Case of the Swaziland Corporation Ltd."

[The role of the colonial state in Swaziland]{.underline} between 1910
and 1945 is generally an unproblematical one.6 [This was a period
of]{.underline} [settler hegemony]{.underline} in which the interests of
an emergent settler-bourgeoisie were decisively serviced by the colonial
state at all crucial points. Colonial land policy during this period is,
for example, an apt testimony to this observation. Nevertheless, [the
state was forced to intervene]{.underline} in an ever greater manner [in
settler-estate production to maintain]{.underline} this
[hegemony]{.underline} [through the encouragement of white settlement
programmes]{.underline}, the disuasion of peasant commodity production
and the arrangement of generous agricultural loans for settlers from the
imperial treasury. [The]{.underline} [period]{.underline} after 1945,
[when]{.underline} the [hegemony]{.underline} of the settler-bourgeoisie
[was]{.underline} successfully [challenged]{.underline} by the infusion
of metropolitan capital, [represents a decisive break in the form and
role of the colonial state]{.underline} in Swaziland. Between 1902 and
1910, however, before the colonial structures of production had fully
evolved, the colonial state was forced to exercise its autonomy to
resolve a developing contradiction within the social formation. This
contradiction was embodied in the form of production which was to
dominate the nature of capitalist accumu- lation in the formation.
[The]{.underline} Swaziland [land partition]{.underline} of 1907 [was
instituted by the colonial state]{.underline} and served a number of
functions. First [it hastened the subordination of the indigenous mode
of production]{.underline} to other forms of production.7 Second, it
secured to the Swazi sufficient land to reproduce their immediate means
of subsistence. Third, [it]{.underline} deliberately [left a
considerable proportion of the]{.underline} Swazi [population on
alienated land to provide an immediate labour force for settler- estate
production]{.underline}.8 The settlers were in basic empathy with at
least the third of these imperatives. This presented the state with a
contradiction, however, for there was intrinsically nothing to prevent
landowners refraining from estate production and merely extracting rent
from the Swazis resident on alienated land. [This was a consumation
which the state devoutly wished to resist for its perceived inhibitory
effect on estate production]{.underline}. Although close collusion
between settlers, metropolitan capital and the colonial state is evident
at most points in the planning and implementation of the partition, a
conflict inevitably arose on who was to control the forces of
production.9 The issue, in the end, was reduced to a straight
confrontation between one British based company, the Swaziland
Corporation Ltd. which claimed extensive holdings in the country, and
the colonial state.

### L -- Humanitarianism

Likewise Tusan has surveyed humanitarianism and the notion of
interventions to alleviate suffering as both an "idea and a practice."
She notes that [early modern monarchs controlled potential external
intervention on behalf of their dispossessed subjects]{.underline}.
[With the Enlightenment,]{.underline} "[broad claims of a universal
humanity offered new ways of understanding the obligation to
act.]{.underline} By the nineteenth century, [an activist sensibility
found voice in campaigns that looked to undo long-held practices like
slavery through pressuring governments to abolish slavery on
humanitarian grounds]{.underline}."13 [The]{.underline} simultaneous
[rise of humanitarianism and imperialism in the modern period has been
noted by a number of scholars]{.underline}, including Joel Quirk, who
delineates the ways that colonialism and antislavery were viewed as
compatible in the nineteenth century.14 Quirk argues that the
[antislavery campaigns marked an important moment in the development of
paternalistic colonialism,]{.underline} and **[abolitionism was less
concerned with human equality than with "colonial
priorities,"]{.underline}** [with legal abolition thus enabling other
forms of unfree and exploitative labour worldwide]{.underline}.15
Indeed, the other "[colonial priorities]{.underline}" of the period were
the expansion of empire in the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions in sites
of British settlement such as North America, Australia, New Zealand, and
South Africa. [It was in these colonies of settlement that the entwined
projects of liberal humanitarianism and empire took on a particular and
potent character. An apparent paradox saw the rise of British
humanitarianism]{.underline} in the 1830s [amidst these aggressively
expanding colonies marked by intense violence against Indigenous
peoples]{.underline}; Lester and Dussart begin their new book by
articulating this conceptual riddle.16 After the abolition of the slave
trade (1807) and later of slavery in the British settlements (1833),
[abolitionist humanitarians began to turn their attention to the fate of
Indigenous peoples in the colonies of settlement, and questions of moral
empire and the possibility of humanitarian governance grew to
prominence]{.underline}.17 [By this time humanitarian precepts had
gained influence throughout the British colonies, resulting in the
establishment of the Aborigines Protection Society in 1837]{.underline}.
In both metropolitan and colonial governing circles, **[humanitarians
generally did not oppose colonisation]{.underline}**, [but increasingly
promoted a benevolent or "Christian colonisation," a civilising mission
of moral enlightenment]{.underline}.18 In the southeastern Australian
colonies, [while humanitarians emphasised the moral imperatives of a
humane colonisation**, pastoralists and agriculturalists insisted on
access to cheap labour and land.**]{.underline} [Many expatriate Britons
challenged the model of a humane or Christian colonisation through an
emerging assertion of "settler" rights and entitlements]{.underline}.
**[A strong doctrine of supercessionism]{.underline}**---that settlers
should rightly replace Indigenes---[was promoted, based on claims of
British moral and racial superiority, and Lockean principles of
civilisation, property and the imperative to cultivate land.19 Colonial
governors could articulate broad humanitarian precepts]{.underline},
**[yet condone violence both retributive and disciplinary and
effectively outsource it to settlers, militia and other
groups]{.underline}**. [So]{.underline} too [the amelioration of
violence could be left to partly formed and messy plural legal
codes]{.underline}, [government missionaries and other humanitarians
entirely independent of the state]{.underline}. In colonial New South
Wales, for example, as settlers crossed the Blue Mountains onto the
Bathurst Plains they faced resistance from Wiradjuri warriors who killed
or wounded both stock and their keepers. Martial law was proclaimed by
Governor Thomas Brisbane (1822--25) on the Bathurst Plains on 14 August
1824 following the killing of seven stockmen by Aborigines in the ranges
north of Bathurst, and the murder of Aboriginal women and children by
settler-vigilantes in what the Sydney Gazette on 14 October 1824 called
"an exterminating war."20 Brisbane also established a mounted police
force whose first frontier deployment to "pacify" Aboriginal peoples was
in the upper Hunter Valley in 1826.21 Despite popular and permissive
claims that the frontier was a place of lawlessness, instead, as Julie
Evans has argued, [the declaration of martial law served to formalise
the frontier as a legal space of violence and was thereby crucial to the
furtherance of the settler project]{.underline}.22 Within a year
Governor Brisbane granted 10,000 acres (4047 ha) to the London
Missionary Society for an Aboriginal reserve at Lake Macquarie.23 The
resident missionary, the Reverend Lancelot Threlkeld, used his
privileged position to witness and publicise settler violence against
Aborigines in graphic terms.24 Some scholars have described Brisbane's
policy towards Aboriginal people as ambivalent, on the one hand imposing
martial law and on the other seeking to compensate lost Aboriginal land
through humanitarian measures. Yet **[this seeming ambivalence rather
reflected the growing tensions of colonisation]{.underline}**, [where
retaliatory and offensive state-sanctioned violence sat alongside an
emergent humanitarianism that sought to conciliate, civilise, compensate
and protect Aboriginal peoples]{.underline}.25 By the mid-nineteenth
century, the [rise of self-governing settler states often permitted and
enabled new forms of organised legal violence]{.underline} (martial law,
native police corps, and child removal) [against Indigenous peoples
deemed non-sovereign in their own lands.]{.underline}

[We must attend carefully to the powerful "cultural politics" of
emotion]{.underline}, as Sara Ahmed has termed them, and in particular
those entwined with the imperial humanitarian project.54 [The dialogic
relationship of sympathy in the mutual constitution of self
and]{.underline} ([colonised) other is "fundamental to asymmetrical
relations of power,"]{.underline} notes Asad. Early [encounters between
Europeans and Indigenous peoples often threatened the integrity of the
European colonising self,]{.underline} suggests Asad, [leading to
"defining interpersonal relations in terms of the asymmetry of
sympathy,]{.underline}" [creating]{.underline} on one hand [an
"antithesis between the colonizing subject of sympathy and on the other
the colonized subject of suffering,"]{.underline} yet [with "each side
dependent on the other for its identity]{.underline}."55 Thus [sympathy
and sentiment might be considered as both the constitution and assertion
of self and other, and as key "emotional complexes shaping relations of
domination and subjection."]{.underline}56 [Pain and
suffering]{.underline}---as witnessed by humanitarians and especially
Quakers travelling "under concern" to gather evidence of sufferings in
slave plantations and on the violent frontiers of colonized land[---were
both relational and through text made highly
representational]{.underline}. In tracing the rise of humanitarianism
and its entwined relations with suffering and pain, Margaret Abruzzo in
her Polemical Pain describes the "changing place of cruelty in moral
thinking," in particular the rise in arguments about the humaneness of
slave treatment over the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries.57 Focusing on these shifts in moral thinking and the very
particular relationship of Quakers with suffering, she charts the
connection between the "suffering spirit of Quakerism" to the moral
opposition to slavery, and the crucial work this effected in reshaping
the self-image of these humanitarians.58 Quakers "invoked a language of
spiritual power exercised through suffering" and, though by the late
eighteenth century no longer martyred, had developed an identity as a
suffering people, and so too a religious lexicon of "sympathy running
parallel to moral-philosophical theories."59 Suffering and pain was thus
a pathway to spiritual growth, while cruelty was viewed as "antithetical
to this identity."60 Members of the Religious Society of Friends were
therefore encouraged to "imagine themselves in the place of the sufferer
and to share sufferers' feelings" and, in the case of slavery, to see
remote slave pain as a particular form of cruelty and "their moral
concern."61 On Flinders Island in the Bass Strait in Australia's
southern ocean in 1832, Quaker George Washington Walker used the
language of humaneness versus barbarity and cruelty in his eyewitness
testimony of the treatment, including the flogging, of Aboriginal women
whom he believed "enslaved" to sealers. Interviewing the women and
communicating though halting language and bodily signs, he wrote,
"some... bear testimony to the cruel treatment they have received from
their unfeeling masters... and were treated with great inhumanity by
their inhuman men."62 [Condemning slavery]{.underline}---[or in the
colonies of settlement rebuking the various "species" of slavery and
unfreedom]{.underline}---[required defence of one's position in terms of
"humaneness," which "struck at the heart of slaveholders"]{.underline}
and their critics' moral identities, writes Abruzzo.63 Yet [the language
of humaneness]{.underline}, **[sympathy and suffering frequently centred
on the body of the enslaved, colonised or subaltern subject, and on the
infliction of pain on that body, rather than the "rights of those
subjects to be free from pain,"]{.underline}** as Abruzzo suggests.64
[Humanitarian benevolence]{.underline}, sympathy and witnessing **[could
diverge widely from rights-based talk and action.]{.underline}** In
examining colonial violence and antecedent histories of rights discourse
in the nineteenth century, [we must consider continuities and
disruptions, as well as historical specificities of their role in
humanitarian discourse]{.underline}. [Although]{.underline} Quaker James
[Backhouse wrote passionately]{.underline} to Thomas Fowell Buxton [on
the "rights of Aborigines" in respect of the colonisation of their
lands]{.underline} while in Van Diemen's Land, [he did not invoke the
"rights" of the Straits Aboriginal women]{.underline}. Instead, [he
spoke of their cruel treatment by sealers, and employing the language of
protection, urging they be protected against exploitation or
abuse]{.underline}. Both [Backhouse]{.underline} and Walker **[urged
sealers to marry the women so that their union should be a Christian
one]{.underline}**.65 [Rights discourse, and the way in which it is
enacted, is too often gendered. Backhouse's language of morality and
emancipation, of overcoming degradation, was aimed at the women's moral
realignment, protection and reform, and not their freedom.]{.underline}

This paper examines conceptions of truth and "the human" in an effort to
engage contemporary discussions of neointerventionism. A central
question in the paper is whether one facet of [the self-justifying
structure of neointerventionism is an operative framing of theories of
truth underlying the explanans sought by foreign policy officials and
state actors.]{.underline} To address this question, I turn to an
unlikely source within philos-ophy of language, neopragmatist theorist
Richard Rorty, to offer an example of an antirepresentationalist and
nonobjectivist description of truth that may help explain the terms and
stakes of neointerventionist policies. My claim, however, will be,
following the critical insights of Cornel West, Chantal Mouffe, and
Sylvia Wynter, that neopragmatist efforts of the sort outlined by Rorty,
while sophisticated in their analyses of the nature of truth and forms
of justification, fail to thoroughly engage [the political conception of
"the human"]{.underline} that [orders and frames debates regarding
objectivity and solidarity]{.underline}. I conclude by returning to the
prob-lematic of neointerventionism from Wynter's framings of what she
calls the "coloniality of truth" and "embattled humanisms."The framing
political issue for this analysis involves a set of epistemic
impli-cations stemming from what contemporary scholars of international
relations are describing as neointerventionism. The term
"[neointerventionism]{.underline}" generally Andrea J. Pitts is

post-Cold War foreign policies of U.S. and allied nation-states of the
Global North that justify economic, military, and/or institutional
interven-tion on largely humanitarian grounds.]{.underline}**

"peacebuilding" or "state-building" efforts that aim to "stabilize"
fragile political sites by instilling the values and institu-tional
structures necessary for the foundations of a democratic
society]{.underline}**. Critics of neointerventionism, on the other
hand, argue that [this form of foreign pol-icy operates as a form of
neoimperialism, seeking to expand global capital under the moral
auspices of freedom, democracy, and basic human rights]{.underline}. The
2003 invasion of Iraq by U.S., UK, Australian, and Polish military
forces, and the 2007 U.S.-Mexico security cooperation agreement called
the "Mérida Initiative" have been examined by such critics as examples
of neointerventionism (e.g., Dexter 2007; Finkenbusch 2016).Regarding
its epistemic implications, some scholars argue that
**[neoint-erventionism operates under the assumption that there are
"deep-seated" causes for criminality or terrorism that must be engaged
at the institutional level]{.underline}** (e.g., within educational or
legal institutions) (e.g., Finkenbusch 2016). The concern here, as
raised by one contemporary critic of neointervention-ism, is that [this
search for "deeper" causes---causes that are ever-increasing in
complexity---for criminality, "radicalization," or other obstacles to
the expan-sion of democracy or the stabilization of global markets,
serve as the very jus-tification for the continued expansion of
interventionist efforts in postcolonial geopolitical
contexts]{.underline} (Finkenbusch 2016, 162--80). As such, U.S.
institutional interventions in Mexico via the Mérida Initiative, for
example, have aided in increasing and enabling the rapid expansion of
the prison-military-industrial complex in Mexico, and further expanding
transnational carceral networks that are validated by the two liberal
nation-states' shared interests in battling the "War of Drugs."

#### Their conception of "Human Rights" relies upon a Western conception of agency that requires the extermination of those in the periphery to maintain the coherence of the Western Liberal subject.

This passage from Mary Ann Glendon's A World Made New: Eleanor Roosevelt
and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (2001)---a widely read
history of the UDHR---is typical in the way it claims decolonization for
the human rights project.12 However, as a broad and growing literature
has demonstrated, [human rights bear anything but an uncomplicated
relationship to (de)colonization.]{.underline} As Makau Mutua says in a
classic essay, **[the human rights corpus "falls within the historical
continuum of the Eurocentric colonial project, in which actors are cast
into superior and subordinate positions"]{.underline}** (2001: 204).
This is the case because ["\[t\]he grand narrative of human rights
contains a subtext that depicts an epochal contest pitting savages, on
the one hand, against victims and saviors, on the other," (201), thus
rendering the whole "normative edifice of the human rights corpus" (207)
and its discourse "unidirectional and predictable" (202), "arrogant and
biased" (206), and marked by "a troubling abundance of
zealotry"]{.underline} (207). Mutua goes on to analyze the SVS
metaphor---savage, victim, saviour---to demonstrate how **[through the
grand narrative of human rights "the Third World is asked to follow a
particular script of history"]{.underline}** (243), belying the human
rights regime's claim to universality.13 Glendon responds to Mutua's
indictment of the universality of the human rights project by arguing
that, "\[w\]here basic human values are concerned, cultural diversity
has been exaggerated" (2001: 222). She notes that the UNESCO
philosophers charged with mining ancient traditions for fundamental
human norms during the drafting of the UDHR found, after consulting with
Confucian, Hindu, Muslim, and European thinkers, that a core of
fundamental principles was widely shared in countries that had not yet
adopted rights instruments and in cultures that had not embraced the
language of rights...The philosophers concluded that even people who
seem to be far apart in theory can agree that certain things are so
terrible in practice that no one will publicly approve them\... (222)
This response is inadequate for three reasons. First, Glendon does not
take seriously the fact that [the institutional structure in which such
a basic human understanding was to be instantiated and enforced was not
universal, and would instead rely on Western power and
coercion.]{.underline}14 **[In her own words, "while it is hard to stick
the label 'Western' on the Declaration itself, that description can
fairly be applied to the membership and finances of the most influential
human rights organizations" (229).]{.underline}** This fact cannot
easily be discarded. Second, even if certain values seem universal, the
ways in which they are codified, lived, expressed, or enforced across
different cultures will almost certainly not be. Finally, Mutua's
critique is less about the normative project of human rights---he in
fact agrees that "the quest to craft a universal bundle of attributes
with which all societies must endow all human beings...is a noble one"
(2001: 209)---but rather aimed at showing how **[the human rights
regime, despite this noble quest, has come to rely on a colonial
construction]{.underline}** (the SVS metaphor) **[and take part in a
civilizing mission.]{.underline}** Mutua, then, is making an argument
about the success of human rights in achieving its aims, rather than a
fault in the aims themselves.15 The Mutua-Glendon exchange, then, flirts
with a deeper debate about the foundations of the human rights project.
The foundationalism debate has essentially sought to interrogate the
status of human rights as 'universal'---whether this is the case,
whether it is possible, and whether it is desirable.16 While this has
been productive insofar as it combats harmful habits of thought that too
easily accept the basis of the human rights project, it has come to
something of a standstill. Cultural relativists, though they often go
too far towards moral relativism, have revealed universalism to be a
wolf in sheep's clothing by showing the ways **[the discursive
construction of the Enlightenment individual was built on a series of
exclusions and assumptions, and enforced through a reign of epistemic
violence that led to scientific racism and eugenics, among other
iniquities.]{.underline}** [The 'truth' and 'reason' that it used to
(supposedly) found the modern world have been accused of attempting to
win "a universal validity and legitimacy for accounts of the world which
are partial and particular," which is how Stuart Hall defines ideology
(1994: 61).]{.underline}17 Succinctly, any partial and particular
worldview that is taken to be universal is an example of ideology, and
ideology is an apparatus by which those who seek power sustain and
further their agendas. While foundationalists will often object that
recourse to a transcendental value outside the human mind is a necessary
check on the whims of politicking (a number of scholars choose God or a
vague public theology as this value, including Stackhouse 1999 and Perry
2000), those who attack this position say that foundations are equally
contingent (and partial) but far deadlier because they claim not to
be.18 This ideological critique of human rights comes from multiple
corners: Those in the Marxian tradition have diagnosed \[human rights\]
as nothing more than an ideological revision of nineteenth-century
bourgeois rights that re-entrenches class exploitation and
oppression...**[Postcolonial theorists have shown that human rights
often function as tools of Western cultural imperialism and as means to
implement neocolonialist economic policies and justify military
interventions.]{.underline}** Critical legal scholars have...analyzed
the limitations of appeals to both human rights and constitutional
rights as a means of gaining power for minority groups in liberal
constitutional states. Meanwhile, feminist theorists have noted the
limitations human rights impose by naturalizing a masculinist notion of
an unencumbered and self-sufficient subject as the model rights-holder.
Perhaps most infamously, Giorgio Agamben...argued that **[\[human
rights\] corroborated a biopolitical regime of domination in
which...life itself became the subject of state-based mechanisms of
juridical power.]{.underline}** (Manfredi 2013: 5-6)19 **[What these
various critiques show is that any substantive foundation for human
rights will present a vision of the world---in the dominant genre, it
will be a masculinist, Western, bourgeoisie one---that excludes a vast
portion of the globe's population in practice, while claiming to be
universal.]{.underline}**20 **[International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and
International Human Rights Law (IHRL) not only see their mission as
rescuing this liberal individualist subject, but also presuppose state
sovereignty as regulative of their respective bodies of
law.]{.underline}** A number of prominent thinkers position themselves
against maximalist foundationalists and this problematic ideal of
universalism. The human subject, they understand, is a complex
conglomeration of ever-changing assemblages that does not fit any sort
of universal mould; shaped by unique histories, places, and encounters,
this subject cannot be spoken for by anyone but
him/her/itself/themselves. How could we possibly still support human
rights as a project with this amorphous post-structuralist subject at
its center? While it might seem counterintuitive, a number of thinkers
have shown that anti-foundationalism is by no means incompatible with a
commitment to human rights. Richard Rorty, in "Human Rights,
Rationality, and Sentimentality" (1993), aims to move thinking about
human rights from a Platonist argument to a Pragmatist argument. He sees
the Platonist (or foundationalist) paradigm as a practical dead end, and
the Pragmatist (or anti-foundationalist) paradigm as offering a more
viable future for human rights discourse. Rorty's problem with
foundationalist arguments is that he cannot locate transcultural facts
that are morally relevant (116), and does not think that the
philosophical tradition before him has been able to do so either.
Philosophers, thinks Rorty, have failed in their attempts to discover
the ontological, essential nature of human beings. Instead of searching
for these facts, we ought to look at what actually works to reduce human
suffering---and this, he thinks, is "hearing sad and sentimental
stories" (119). As a pragmatist wary of metaphysical propositions, he
says out with 'reason' and in with the affective, emotive, and
sentimental. The conclusion he arrives at is that 'respecting dignity'
does not presuppose knowledge of a distinct human nature. Dignity,
rather, can be respected on an affective basis and can be located in a
shared experience of humanness rather than the ontological definition of
humanness.21 Like Rorty, Michael Ignatieff wants to discard most
foundations in favour of 'what works', which involves protecting the
agency of individuals to live the life they choose; for him, "human
rights is only a systematic agenda of 'negative liberty,' a tool kit
against oppression" (2001: 57). Ignatieff's vision accommodates the
cultural relativist critique of Western foundationalism by arguing that
human rights should not prescribe the ways of life that are good, but
merely protect "the minimum conditions for any kind of life at all"
(56). This is an attempt to reclaim the value of moral individualism,
insisting that individualism is both at the heart of rights, and that it
is not necessarily a carrier of Western ideological imperialism (67).
Thus Ignatieff is not unaware that foundations secret within them
theories of human nature, histories of global development,
understandings of power, and visions of ideal futures. This is one of
the reasons why anything but a 'thin' or 'minimalist' foundation appears
overloaded with ideological baggage and susceptible to corruption. Any
one of these associated theories, histories, understandings, or visions
can be a life-line as well as a noose for those individuals and cultures
that organize their experience of the world under different terms. Thus,
a minimalist human rights discourse "is the only universally available
moral vernacular" (68) because it places the story of human history
against theories of human nature (80). Ignatieff's emphasis on the
language of deliberation---the story of human history leading to a
shared minimalist moral vernacular---makes his vision flexible, for it
focuses on a method rather than a rule. Consequently, both Rorty and
Ignatieff ask: instead of thinking about what could absolutely compel
adherence to a human rights regime, what is it that currently does
propel individuals to invest in a human rights culture? Ultimately,
Ignatieff asserts, in terms that Rorty would endorse, that our moral
intuitions "derive simply from our own experience of pain and our
capacity to imagine the pain of others" (88). In this way, the
Glendon-Mutua exchange is addressed and transcended by these thinkers,
who propose a minimalism that neither aspires to hardline universalism
nor gives up on the normative project of human rights.22 Importantly for
later chapters, both these accounts (Ignatieff's explicitly, Rorty's
implicitly) sound decidedly liberal, for as Edmund Fawcett says,
"\[y\]ou are a strange sort of liberal if you cannot give in to
indignation and outrage" (2014: 301).

To read the contemporary neointerventionist discourse in light of
Rorty's work, we can turn to Voparil's interpretation of his conception
of redescrip-tion. Voparil asks "what would it mean to read Rorty as
doing political the-ory?" and his reply is that his work is engaged in
the task of offering "crafted narratives and imaginative visions rather
than truth and validity . . . to spark change" (2004, 227). In this
vein, [Rorty seeks to "re-enchant the world]{.underline}" via the task
of redescription which seeks, in Voparil's words, ["to generate an
opti-mistic, communitarian emotional attitude]{.underline}" (234).5
However, despite this gen-erous reading of Rorty's project, [Voparil
views Rorty's political work as proposing a false dichotomy between
"postmodern pessimism and 'knowing-ness,'" that result in inaction and
the depoliticization of action, on the one hand, and "romantic
enthusiasm" for liberal utopianism, on the other, that is, a liberal
utopianism that is meant to provide the normative impetus for social
change (234--35).]{.underline} This dichotomy, on Voparil's reading,
then overlooks the "unsightly realities of our past" and it "fails to
recognize that forms of disen-chantment and discontent, the feeling that
one's country has let one down, can also mobilize people to action,
maybe even more so than enchantment 5 See also Rorty 1984, 42. HUMANIST
BATTLES AND EMBATTLED HUMANISTS109and romance" (235; 237). Thus, with
respect to interventionism [of human rights]{.underline}, the
[roman-ticized commitment from allied Global Northern nation-states that
the expansion, democracy, and legal norms necessary for social stability
will stem from political sites such as the U.S., the UK, and other
"bourgeois liberal" contexts parallels the dichotomizing tendencies and
opti-mism that we find in Rorty]{.underline}. Moreover, **[resilience
thinking offers an optimism that requires no foundationalisms about
human behaviors or human motiva-tions for actions, save the implicit
claim that contexts like the U.S. function as a relatively stable
complex system that has the institutional infrastructure to monitor and
preserve human rights and cosmopolitan values.]{.underline}**

#### Tying freedom and justice movements to the state proves they fail

Peter Finkenbusch argues, regarding the 2007 U.S.-Mexican security
agreement called the Mérida Initiative, that this U.S. interventionist
effort tracks the shifts between neoliberal interventionist models and
resilience models. Namely, this security agreement, he writes, "went
within just a few years from a rather straightforward, Cold War-type of
arms deal centering on law enforcement training and military equipment
deliveries to a compre-hensive policy endeavor aimed at the promotion of
good governance, the [protection of human rights]{.underline} and the
inclusion of civil society" (2017, 3). This shift to viewing Mexican
society and Mexican institutions as "weak" or in need of further
"support" in order to be resilient to the ongoing patterns of
drug-related crime thereby serves to motivate neointerventionism. This
[form]{.underline} 2 See also James 2014. HUMANIST BATTLES AND EMBATTLED
HUMANISTS101 [of interventionism expands the scope of state-sponsored
efforts from "formal state institutions to informal social milieu and
from technical assistance and material resource transfers to
capacity-building and empowerment"]{.underline} (4). As Dexter argues,
this shift thereby depoliticizes the interventionist efforts that seek
to reshape and control educational, legal, economic, and cultural
institu-tions of the Global South under the auspices of strengthening
the "social fab-ric" of "weak states." For example, among the "Four
Pillars" of the Mérida Initiative are efforts aimed at
"Institutionalizing Reforms to Sustain the Rule of Law and Respect for
Human Rights in Mexico" and "Building Strong and Resilient Communities"
(Seelke and Finklea 2017).Accordingly, as Finkenbusch, Chandler, and
Dexter argue, the under-lying ontology and epistemic aims of
interventionism have shifted as well. Finkenbusch calls these
transformed epistemic aims "neo-institutional learn-ing" (2017, 25). He
proposes this model to explain the analytic dynamics of the expansion of
interventionist reasoning. That is, following the neoliberal policy
recommendations of the 1990s that sought to restructure the econo-mies
of Latin America and Southeast Asia, the focus within interventionist
studies on economic development began to shift to better understand the
lack of efficacy of such "Washington Consensus" efforts. Rather than
targeting tax reform, trade liberalization, exchange rates, deregulation
of markets, and so on, the causes for these unsuccessful economic
interventions were thought to be unstable institutions themselves. As
such, the institutional settings wherein people make choices and act
become the focus of neointerventionism. Such a shift in emphasis
requires a new form of learning and adaptation to the com-plexity of
human social behavior itself. Both for Finkenbusch and Chandler, the
presumption of instrumental rationality that functioned within liberal
and neoliberal iterations (i.e., known knowns and known unknowns)
recedes from view and gives way to process-based understandings of
institutions and human behavior. As such, unknown unknowns are assumed
as a part of the complexity of human-institutional interactions, and the
[ever-increasing need for contextualized knowledge implies an unlimited
expansion of causal networks to explain the motivations for
"criminality," "terrorism," or other obstacles to stability identified
by allied nation-states of the Global North]{.underline}. Accordingly,
this rejection of a liberal universal framework characterizes
neo-institutional learning.Regarding the Mérida Initiative in
particular, the funding of the initia-tive began in 2007 when
then-president of Mexico Felipe Calderón sought support from George W.
Bush in an effort to address drug and weapons traf-ficking in Mexico.
Prior to this period, Mexico had rejected assistance from the U.S. in
their counterdrug efforts due, in part, as in the Congressional Research
Service report on the initiative states, to Mexican concerns about
102ANDREA J. PITTS"U.S. government involvement in the country's internal
affairs" (Seelke and Finklea 2017, 21). The 2007 agreement between
Calderón and Bush was that both nation-states would hold shared
responsibility for reducing the amount of drugs and weapons that
circulated across the two countries. To enable the Mexican government to
uphold its responsibilities, the first phase of the initiative from 2008
to 2010 included \$1.5 billion allotted for surveillance and security
equipment, including aircraft, a canine training program, and train-ing
programs for Mexican prosecutors, correctional officers, and
investigators led by U.S. officials. In 2011, the two nation-states
renegotiated the agree-ment and shifted from a focus on judicial and law
enforcement strategies to a broader "four-pillar strategy." These
pillars included: "disrupting organized criminal groups,"
"institutionalizing the rule for law while protecting human rights,"
"creating a 21st century border," \[and\] "building strong and
resil-ient communities" (21). Included in this second phase of the
initiative were social programs designed to address the "root causes of
violence" (21). From 2011 to 2016, the funding for the initiative
reached \$1.1 billion. The funding for the 2017 fiscal year, approved by
the House and Senate Appropriations Committees was \$129 million. The
money is being used to enhance police budgets, to reform the judicial
and penal systems, including U.S. training and certification programs,
audio/visual equipment in courtrooms, health-care standard
certifications in Mexican prisons, and the transformation of the legal
curricula in Mexican law schools. Additionally, crime and violence
prevention programs have been included as part of the fourth pillar of
the initiative. Namely, the U.S. provided funding for "at-risk youth
programs," drug counselors, and a "Culture of Lawfulness" educational
program for middle school students (12). While these forms of
intervention may appeal to many liberal-minded scholars as important
areas that protect human rights, human flourishing, or basic social
goods, Finkenbusch notes that these efforts also signal a shift in U.S.
interventionist efforts from economic development and security and law
enforcement strategies, to institutional reform that seeks more
"comprehensive policy work on Mexican civil society" (Finkenbusch 2017,
124).In particular, the "Culture of Lawfulness" program aims to impact
more than simply the legal and law enforcement institutions in Mexico.
Notably, the early efforts of the Mérida Initiative were designed to
implement eco-nomic, legal, and law enforcement policies to deter drug
trafficking across Mexico and the U.S. However, by 2011, former
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton proposed to expand the program to
institution building. The reason for this shift was due to the idea that
increased funding for judicial, legal, and economic reform would only be
effective if "corruption" and human rights abuses were addressed within
those institutions (128). In this sense, the HUMANIST BATTLES AND
EMBATTLED HUMANISTS103initiative's second phase sought to address the
causes of corruption and a perceived lack of a "culture of lawfulness."
A "Culture of Lawfulness" within this framework means that "the [average
person believes that legal norms are a fundamental part of justice
and]{.underline} that the . . . [legal and judicial system enhances the
quality of life of individuals and society as a whole]{.underline}"
(129)3Accordingly, the fact sheet on the Culture of Lawfulness programs
from the U.S. Embassy and Consulates in Mexico describe its efforts as
aims "to instill a sense of individual responsibility to uphold the rule
of law in Mexico, with the larger goal of reducing crime and corruption
. . . \[and to\] promote civic participation, efficient public services,
and government transparency" (Embassy of the United States in Mexico
2017). Finkenbusch thus points to the emphasis here on corruption as a
justification for addressing "deviant behavior and anti-social mindsets"
through educational reform, the private sector, and other public
campaigns aimed at an individual choice to value and uphold legal norms.
Thus, as he continues, "rather than recognizing the structural
constraints that force many Mexican citizens and officials into
dif-ficult choices," the Culture of Lawfulness program individualizes
responsibil-ity and decision-making processes. Consequently, the
motivations for human action and the challenges to institution building
move further into the "hearts and minds" of Mexican citizens.

### L -- International Law

#### International law practice is rooted in the Discovery Doctrine against Indigenous people to reinforce Settler societies and a reaffirmation of colonialism. 

**Miller '11---**Robert J. Miller is a professor at Arizona State
University and his areas of expertise are civil procedure, federal
Indian law, American Indians and international law. (8/31/2011, "The
International Law of Colonialism: A Comparative Analysis",
<https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1920009> //RC)

**[Europeans automatically acquired property rights in native lands and
gained governmental, political, and commercial rights over the
Indigenous inhabitants without their knowledge or
consent.]{.underline}**3 [This legal principle was created and justified
by religious, racial, and ethnocentric ideas of European and Christian
superiority over other peoples and religions. The Doctrine is still
international and domestic law today and is being actively applied
against Indigenous peoples and nations]{.underline}. For example,
American, Canadian, New Zealand, Australian, and international courts
have struggled with questions regarding Discovery and Indigenous land
titles in recent decades.4 And in 2007 and 2010, Russia and China evoked
the Doctrine by planting their flags on the Arctic Ocean and South China
Sea Seabed's to claim commercial and sovereign rights.5 In addition, the
Doctrine has been featured prominently in the international news in
recent years as Indigenous activists and some churches have worked to
repudiate it.6 In fact, in May of 2012, the United Nations Permanent
Forum on Indigenous Issues will address the Doctrine.7In the fifteenth
to twentieth centuries, European countries utilized Discovery in their
explorations and claims over Indigenous peoples in the Americas and
Oceania[**. These colonial/settler societies used Discovery principles
and ethnocentric** **ideas of superiority** to stake legal claims to the
lands and rights of native peoples. **Understanding Discovery and how it
became the law of colonialism** around the world is crucial to
understanding and addressing the modern-day situations and status of
Indigenous peoples and nations]{.underline}. One American professor
aptly stated the importance of comprehending and examining the Doctrine:
Detailed reassessment of early history may seem unnecessary to a present
understanding of Native Americans. Some may think it enough to
acknowledge the fallaciousness of the notion of ―discovery. ‖ with all
it implies in the way of colonial arrogance. But the fact that
―[discovery‖ became part of the institutional structure of America means
that America consists of a continual reaffirmation of colonialism. The
nature of this colonialism explains much of the present
scene.]{.underline}8 In this Article, by comparing and contrasting the
[law of colonialism]{.underline} and Discovery [in]{.underline} the nine
countries of Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, England, New Zealand,
Portugal, Spain, and [the United States,]{.underline} I hope to
[demonstrate]{.underline} that these countries and their [modern day
legal systems do reflect ―a continual reaffirmation of colonialism
regarding Indigenous nations and peoples.]{.underline} [If one
understands the international law Doctrine of Discovery, it makes
perfect sense that Spain, Portugal, and England and their colonists
applied the international legal principles against Indigenous peoples in
a nearly identical fashion]{.underline}. Europeans, and later the
[colonial countries, believed they possessed the only valid religions,
civilizations, governments, laws, and cultures, and that Providence
intended that their institutions should dominate Indigenous
peoples.]{.underline} There is no question that these nine countries
[applied the international law of colonialism. As a result, the
governmental, property, and human rights of Indigenous peoples were
almost totally disregarded as Discovery directed]{.underline} European
[colonial expansion. In modern times, these assumptions remain dangerous
legal fictions]{.underline}. In focusing on the [Doctrine of
Discovery]{.underline}, this Article has reinforced the statement that
―[legal systems develop in close contact to others: new ideas may evolve
within one line of tradition and then spread quickly, with great effect
on other legal systems]{.underline}.‖533 The similar application of
Discovery around the world demonstrates the truth of that statement. The
common understanding and [application of]{.underline} the [international
law was and is potent and lethal to Indigenous peoples and
nations.]{.underline} [Correcting and erasing the vestiges of Discovery
from the modern-day laws and lives of settler societies illustrates the
complexity that will be **involved in decolonizing the legal systems of
these countries**]{.underline}. **[But that is a task that must be
undertaken and must succeed if the legal and human rights of Indigenous
peoples are going to be honored around the world, and if Indigenous
peoples are going to have equal rights to
self-determination.]{.underline}**

#### Ideas that international law is needed to protect the "backward" other comes from Eurocentric ideas of superiority and the need to spread the European experience -- this mission legitimizes extreme violence against non-European people

[The view that the \"native\" is weak]{.underline}, powerless, prone to
laziness, [and unable]{.underline} on his own [to create the conditions
for]{.underline} his [development was a recurrent theme in Western
representations of the \"other.\"]{.underline} Early in the life of the
organization, [an International Labor Organization report concluded, for
example, that indigenous peoples could not by themselves overcome their
\"backwardness.\" It noted, \"\[It is now almost universally recognized
that, left to their own resources, indigenous peoples would have
difficulty in overcoming their inferior economic and social situation
which inevitably leaves them open for exploitation.\"]{.underline} 129
In the culture of the human rights movement, whose center is [in the
West]{.underline}, [there is a belief that human rights problems afflict
people \"over there\" and not people \"like us.\"]{.underline} [The
missionary zeal to help those who cannot help themselves is one of the
logical conclusions of this attitude.]{.underline} [The idea that the
human rights corpus is concerned with ordering the lives of non-European
peoples has a long history in international law itself]{.underline}.
More recent scholarship explores this [link between international law
and the imposition of European norms, values, ideas, and culture on
non-European societies and cultures]{.underline}. 130 Since the
inception of the current international legal order some five centuries
ago, [there have been outright challenges by non-European cultures to
the logic, substance, and purpose of international law.]{.underline}131
[The development of human rights has]{.underline} only
[blunted]{.underline}, but not eliminated, some of those
[challenges]{.underline}. V. THE METAPHOR OF THE SAVIOR [The metaphor of
the savior is constructed through]{.underline} two intertwining
characteristics-[Eurocentric universalism and Christianity\'s missionary
zeal]{.underline}. This section examines these characteristics and the
institutional, international actors who promote liberal democracy as the
antidote to human rights abuses. First, [the savior metaphor is deeply
embedded in]{.underline} the Enlightenment\'s [universalist pretensions,
which constructed Europe as superior and as center of the
universe]{.underline}. 132 [International law]{.underline} itself [is
founded on these assumptions and premises]{.underline}. 133
[International law has succeeded in governing \"states of all
civilizations, European and non-European,\"]{.underline} 134 and [it has
become \"universal\"]{.underline} although some have argued that it
bears an ethnocentric fingerprint. 135 In addition to the Eurocentric
focus of human rights, the metaphor of the savior is also located in the
missionary\'s Christian religion. Inherent to any universalizing creed
is an unyielding faith in the superiority of at least the beliefs of the
proselytizer over those of the potential convert, if not over the person
of the convert. The project of universality or proselytism seeks to
remake the \"other\" in the image of the converter. Christianity has a
long history of such zealotry. Both [empire-building and the spread of
Christendom justified]{.underline} the means. [Crusades, inquisitions,
witch burnings, Jew burnings and pogroms, burnings of heretics and gay
people, of fellow Christians and of infidels -all in the name of the
cross]{.underline}. It is almost as if Constantine, upon his and his
empire\'s conversion to Christianity in the fourth century, uttered a
well-fulfilled prophecy when he declared: \'In the name of this cross we
shall conquer.\' The cross has played the role of weapon time and time
again in Christian history and empire building.136 [In fact, the
political-cultural push to universalize one\'s beliefs]{.underline} can
be so obsessive that it [has been identified frequently with martyrdom
in history]{.underline}. \[Tlhe supreme sacrifice was to die fighting
under the Christian emperor. The supreme self-immolation was to fall in
battle under the standard of the Cross \.... But by the time
Christianity was ready to meet Asia and the New World, the Cross and the
sword were so identified with one another that the sword itself was a
cross. It was the only kind of cross some conquistadores understood. 137
There is a historical continuum in this impulse to universalize
Eurocentrism and its norms and to ratify them under the umbrella of
\"universalism.\" Whether it is in the push for free markets, liberal
systems of government, \"civilized\" forms of dress, or in the ubiquity
of the English language itself, at least the last five centuries can
appropriately be called the Age of Europe. These Eurocentric models have
not been content to remain at home. They intrinsically define themselves
as eternal truths. [Universalization is an essential attribute
of]{.underline} their [validity]{.underline}. This [validation comes
partly from the conquest of the \"primitive\" and his introduction and
delivery to \"civilization.\"]{.underline}\'138 For international law,
Anghie has captured this impulse clearly: \[[Tihe extension and
universalization of the European experience, which is achieved by
transmuting it into the major theoretical problem of]{.underline} the
discipline \[inter[national law\], has the effect of]{.underline}
suppressing and [subordinating other histories of international law and
the people to whom it has applied.]{.underline} Within the axiomatic
framework of positivism, which decrees that European states are
sovereign while non-European states are not, there is only one means of
relating the history of the non-European world, and this the positivists
proceed to do: it is a history of the civilizing mission, the process by
which peoples of Africa, Asia, the Americas, and the Pacific were
finally assimilated into a European international law.139 [The impulses
to conquer, colonize, save, exploit, and civilize nonEuropean peoples
met at the intersection of commerce, politics, law, and Christianity and
evolved into the Age of Empire]{.underline}. As put by John Norton
Pomeroy, [lands occupied by \"persons who are not recognized as
belonging to the great family of states to whom international law
applies\" or by \"savage, barbarous tribes\" belonged as of right upon
discovery to the \"civilized and Christian nation.]{.underline} 140 The
savior-colonizer psyche reflects an intriguing interplay of both
European superiority and manifest destiny over the subject. [The
\"othering\" project degrades although it also seeks to
save.]{.underline} One example is the manipulative manner in which [the
British took over large chunks of Africa.]{.underline} Lord [Lugard, the
British colonialist, described]{.underline} in denigrating language [a
\"treaty-making\" ceremony in which an African ruler \"agreed\" to
\"British protection.\"]{.underline} He described this ceremony with
both parties \"\[sleated cross-legged on a mat opposite to each other on
the ground, you should picture a savage chief in his best turn-out,
which consists probably of his weapons of war, different chalk
colourings on his face, a piece of the skin of a leopard, wild cat,
sheep or ox.\" 141 As put by a European missionary, the \"Mission to
Africa\" was \"the least that we \[Europeans\] can do \... to strive to
raise him \[the African\] in the scale of mankind.\"142 Anghie notes
that the deployment of denigrating, demeaning language is essential to
the psyche of the savior. He writes: [The violence of positivist
language in relation to non-European peoples is hard to overlook.
Positivists developed an elaborate vocabulary for denigrating these
peoples, presenting them as suitable objects for conquest, and
legitimizing the most extreme violence against them, all in the
furtherance of the civilizing mission - the discharge of the white
man\'s burden.]{.underline} 143 Human rights law continues this
tradition of universalizing Eurocentric norms by intervening in Third
World cultures and societies to save them from the traditions and
beliefs that it frames as permitting or promoting despotism and
disrespect for human rights itself.

### L -- Interventionism

#### US interventionism in foreign affairs serves to broaden its scope of settler colonialism

**Inwood and Bonds 16** (Joshua Inwood & Anne Bonds (2016) Confronting
White Supremacy and a Militaristic Pedagogy in the U.S. Settler Colonial
State, Annals of the American Association of Geographers, 106:3,
521-529, DOI: 10.1080/24694452.2016.1145510) //bc

[The analytic of militarism requires first a focus on the United States
as produced through settler colonialism]{.underline} (Morgensen 2011;
Smith 2012; Hixson 2013; Veracini 2013). A. Bonds and Inwood (2015)
explained [settler colonialism as a continuously unfolding project of
empire that is enabled by and through specific racial configurations
that are tied to geographies of white supremacy.]{.underline} In a U.S.
context, [settler colonialism begins with the removal of first peoples
from the land and the creation of racialized and gendered labor systems
that make the land productive for the colonizers]{.underline}. This
includes the removal of Native peoples and geographies of indentured
servitude, slavery, sharecropping, and, more contemporarily, urban
abandonment and practices of mass imprisonment. Settler colonialism,
therefore, emphasizes the ongoing processes of racialized capital
accumulation and dis- placement necessary to sustain the permanent
occupation of a territory. In this sense, **[it is an enduring
structure---an interrelated political, social, and eco- nomic process
that continuously unfolds]{.underline}**---[requiring continued
reconfigurations and interventions by the state]{.underline} (Wolfe
2006). Because of the constant reworking of social and political
economic hierarchies necessary to sustain settler relations, t[his
sociospatial dialectic is central to understanding how particular
place-based configurations of race, class, ethnicity, and gender come to
predominate in the United States]{.underline} (for a broader discussion
see S. Hall 1996; Gilmore 1999; A. Bonds and Inwood 2015). According to
Smith (2012), [settler colonialism is sustained by three primary logics
that enshrine white supremacy. The first of these logics is that of
slavery, which is usually premised on the enslavement of black people,
the devaluation of black life, and the racialized political economy
established through this system.]{.underline} Rather than being located
in the past, the logic of slavery mutates and mobilizes across time and
space, systematized through various structures of social control that
dispossess and retain black bodies as permanent property of the state.
This logic connects slavery, sharecropping, welfare programs, and mass
imprisonment (Smith 2012). [The logic of slavery rationalizes racial
exploitation and is the cornerstone for the very notion of private
property]{.underline}. As Harris (1993) argued, "The origins of property
rights in the United States are rooted in racial domination" (1734) that
is connected to slavery and gives rise to a very specific form of
U.S.-style polit- ical economy built on and through the subordination of
persons of color. [Thus, slavery introduces into the life of the nation
the routine and naturalized "state- sanctioned or extralegal production
and exploitation of group-differentiated vulnerability to premature
death" that is the heart of U.S.-style racism]{.underline} (Gilmore
2007, 28). The associated practices and systems not only justify death
as the "collateral consequences" of U.S. development, but they undergird
the social and premature death of structural racism (Gilmore 2007). [A
second and interconnected logic is genocide, pre- mised on the ongoing
disappearance of indigenous peoples in support of the appropriation and
privatization of indigenous lands]{.underline} (Smith 2012). [Genocide
sustains a spatial politics of erasure and exclusion, institutionalized
by state practices that justify indigenous removal and settler land
claims.]{.underline} The practices of genocide are ani- mated by and
through logics of private property that connect geographies of
indigenous disappearance with labor systems meant to make the land
productive. Finally, **[a third pillar is orientalism, grounded in the
belief of the inferiority and threatening menace of non-Western nations
and peoples]{.underline}** (Smith 2012). 1 **[This introduces into the
United States a state of permanent warfare in which the nation is
consistently besieged by enemies]{.underline}** ([externally and
internally**); as a consequence, there is a constant need to protect
"the well-being of empire"**]{.underline} (Smith 2012, 69). The
foundational rationales of slavery, genocide, and orientalism contour
the white supremacist settler state: The founding moments of US
nationalism \[meaning the social and cultural identity of the nation\]
are foundational to both state and culture. The US was conceived in
slavery and christened by genocide. These early practices established
high expectations of state aggression against enemies of the national
purpose and that valorized armed men in uniform as the nation's true
sacrificial subjects. (Gilmore 2002, 20) These logics are reformulated
and continue to take shape in an era of ostensible color-blindness
predominated by official discourses and government commitments to racial
equality. Even as overt racism is eschewed, taken for granted
socioeconomic hierarchies, racial exploitation, and the redistribution
of wealth reproduce and sustain white supremacy. [The U.S. settler state
internalizes a "righteous violence" predicated on an expanding "quest
for total security" that has come to characterize domestic and foreign
policy]{.underline} (Hixson 2013, 198). Although there are myriad ways
to explore the interrelations between state-sanctioned violence and
militarism, we find the connections between domestic policing and the
U.S. military-industrial complex to be particularly illustrative. Kraska
and Cubellis (1997) noted that there is a long history of collusion
between the military and police departments in the United States and the
military paradigm is an important organizing principle within the
development of modern policing practices, organization, and tactics
(e.g., Bittner 1970; Manning 1977; Enloe 1980; A. Hall and Coyne 2012).
These practices took on added significance during the latter half of the
twentieth century as U.S. cities faced increased pressure to "get tough
on crime" and as local police departments developed specially trained
tactical teams, commonly referred to as Special Weapons and Tactics
(SWAT) teams (Kraska and Cubellis 1997). The interactions between the
military and domestic police practices intensified yet again during the
"war on drugs" and in a post--11 September 2001 world where domestic
terror concerns have fueled the explosive growth of military and police
cooperation (A. Hall and Coyne 2012). Although ostensibly unconnected to
questions of race and economic inequality, militarism is fundamentally
linked to structural violences of poverty and social difference (Loyd
2009, 2014), and the pursuit of total security connects settler state
militarism across scales, legitimating the expansion and protection of
the nation-state, the policing of its borders and communities, and
internal and external monitoring and surveillance in the name of
defense. Securing the white supremacist settler state relies on racial,
gender, and class hierarchies that enable the coherence of an imagined
nation with clearly marked inclusions and exclusions. That is, the
targeted and widespread violence that characterizes the U.S. settler
state---seen in everything from the genocide directed toward Native
peoples to the criminalization of com- munities of color---depends on
and reinforces discursive constructions that demonize those who stand in
the way of the settler state and, more often than not, culminates in
national campaigns against those beyond the scope of U.S. settler state
justice. The indiscriminate killing associated with this kind of
violence is easily dismissed as an unfortunate consequence of war
(Hixson 2013). **[U.S. interventionism relies on a "defensive
solidarity\...built on the institution of slavery and the racialization
of Blackne]{.underline}**ss[" that reaffirms white supremacist cultural
identity by managing both internal and external threats]{.underline}
(Loyd 2009, 406). **[These practices continue even after the settler
state has displaced and "removed" native peoples who had previously
occupied the land]{.underline}**, [creating political landscapes with an
aggressive propensity for violence]{.underline} (Veracini 2010). [This
understanding of the United States as a settler state is significant for
theorizing militarism,]{.underline} we argue, [because it situates the
persistent violences of genocide and slavery as enduring structures
shaping social and political economic relations]{.underline}. Rather
than being projects of the past, [settler practices are central to the
continued development and futurity of the United States. A settler
colonial perspective disrupts the spatial imaginaries of war by
emphasizing the ongoing racialized violence necessary to secure
contested, although taken for granted, home- lands in settler
nation]{.underline}s. Moreover, it connects the indiscriminate violence
stretching from U.S. settler colonial history to contemporary military
engagements (Hixson 2013). [As Blackhawk and Apache helicopters swoop
and attack and Tomahawk cruise missiles explode, and as U.S. Special
Forces head into "Indian country" to search and destroy the enemy, the
ramifications and taken for granted sensibilities of settler geographies
become all too clea]{.underline}r (Hixson 2013, 198). Hixson (2013)
further clarified, "[American settler colonialism is a winner- takes-all
proposition that demanded the removal of indigenous peoples and the
destruction of their cultures," and these geographies have "profound
consequences for national identity and subsequent foreign
po]{.underline}licy" (197). **[The settler state is premised on
permanent war]{.underline}**, [inscribing militarism and violence into
everyday geographies and naturalizing racialized power hierarchies and
the dispossession and erasure of racialized bodies.]{.underline}

### L -- Intrastate conflict 

#### The affirmatives analysis of "intrastate conflict" inevitably fails through mystifying settler colonialisms role in creating the desires to conquer land \[Hidden alt solves case stuff\]

**Pitts 18** \["Humanist battles and Embattled Humanists: Neo
Interventionism, Neopragmatism, and the Coloniality of Truth" Andrea J.

Carolina, Charlotte. Their research interests include social

American and U.S. Latinx philosophy, and critical prison

Given this framing concern regarding neointerventionism, this paper
examines several considerations regarding truth and conceptions of "the
human" in an effort to engage the abovementioned discussion within the
field of international relations. Following the critical strand within
this literature, my question is whether one facet of the self-justifying
structure of neointer-ventionism is an operative framing of theories of
truth underlying the explan-ans sought by foreign policy officials and
state actors. In this vein, I turn to a (perhaps unlikely) source within
philosophy of language, neopragmatist the-orist Richard Rorty, to offer
an example of an antirepresentational and non-objectivist description of
truth that may help explain the terms and stakes of neointerventionist
policies. My claim, however, will be, following the respec-tive critical
insights of Cornel West, Chantal Mouffe, and Sylvia Wynter, that
neopragmatist efforts of the sort outlined by Rorty, while sophisticated
in their HUMANIST BATTLES AND EMBATTLED HUMANISTS95 **[analyses of the
nature of truth and forms of justification, fail to thoroughly engage
the political conception of "the human" that orders and frames debates
regarding objectivity, solidarity, and truth.]{.underline}**
Accordingly, I conclude by returning to the problematic of
neointerventionism from Wynter's framings of what she calls the
"coloniality of truth" and "embattled humanisms."NEOINTERVENTIONISM AND
ITS EPISTEMOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONSTo elaborate the relevance of
neopragmatist discourses of truth for contem-porary political theory, it
is important to highlight some of the discursive mechanisms by which
modern nation-states justify interventionist efforts. As the study of
neointerventionism highlights, [epistemic framings of inter-ventionism
have shifted over the course of the twentieth century]{.underline}. As
Helen Dexter articulates the shift, in a classic liberal model, the
causes for interven-tion within a given context are organized in terms
of advancing "state inter-ests or as an instrumental response to
insecurity" (2007, 1056). Additionally, alongside what might be
considered the "**[old" imperialism of the nineteenth century of the
U.S. and Western nation-states there are now added forms of secular
humanist justifications for intervention that are based on the moral
tenets of cosmopolitanism, human rights, and the responsibility to
protect vulnerable populations worldwide (1056).]{.underline}** Dexter
describes some [significant changes in the justifications for
interventionist efforts]{.underline} following the end of the Cold War.
In particular, she outlines the rise of a field of study that proposes
that the end of the Cold War ushered in a new era of warfare.
[Throughout the 1990s and the first decade of the 2000s]{.underline},
theorists in interna-tional relations, security studies, political
economy, and global governance [studies]{.underline} have [described a
shift away from state-centered forms of warfare to the emergence of
intrastate violence**. Such intra-state violence enacted, they propose,
by armies, paramilitaries, militia, child soldiers, criminals, and
terrorists result in massive civilian deaths, human rights abuses, and
forced displacements (1059). Additionally, the motivations for such
"new" forms of warfare, these theorists argue, are "private economic
gain" and a "backward-looking identity politics of ethnicity or religion
and supported by a decentralized and informal economy reliant on
external contributions and criminality"**]{.underline} (1058--59).
Dexter's challenge to this narrative is that such reconceptualizations
of violence and intra-state conf lict often overlook the many examples
of non-Western intra-state warfare that occurred prior to the 1990s. For
example, the decolonial struggles of Nigeria-Biafra, Angola, and
Mozambique, and the military dictatorships of the 1960s and 1970s in
Brazil and Argentina are potential counterexamples to this narrative.
Additionally, 96ANDREA J. PITTSas mentioned above, the "new war" view
places the motivations for con-f lict on criminality, terrorism, and
mostly private efforts for individual gain. Notably, Stathis Kalyvas has
argued, the central claim is that civil conf lict prior to the end of
the Cold War was largely motivated by "broad, well-de-fined, clearly
articulated, universalistic, ideologies of social change" (2002, 102).
The contrast to this, then, is that [new intra-state conf lict is
believed to be motivated by the pursuit of personal gain that bears no
principled or even ideological legitimations by rebel and insurgent
groups.]{.underline} In this vein, consider former UN Secretary General
Kofi Annan's statement in 1999 that the "pursuit of diamonds, drugs,
timber concessions and other valuable com-modities" drives internal conf
lict, or current Attorney General Jeff Sessions's statements that drug
trafficking is being carried out by "thugs," and that sanctuary cities
are providing "lawless" safe havens for criminals (Annan 1999; Sessions
2017a and 2017b).

### L -- Islamophobia

#### Islamophobia is part of a broader trend of otherization caused by Western settler colonialism

**Esposito and Kalin 11** (John L. Esposito and Ibrahim Kalin.
"Islamophobia : The Challenge of Pluralism in the 21st Century", edited
by John L. Esposito, and Ibrahim Kalin, Oxford University Press, 2011.

//bc

The term Islamophobia has gained currency in the United States
relatively recently, mainly since the 1980s, in the wake of the Iranian
Revolution and the Tehran hostage crisis, which created a backlash in
the United States against Islam and Muslims. However, [animosity toward
and suspicion or fear of Islam and Muslims has a much longer
history]{.underline}, **[one that is intertwined with modernity,
colonialism, and globalization and with the relationship of the United
States to areas designated as "Muslim" or "Middle
Eastern."]{.underline}** **[The genealogy of Islamophobia can be traced
to the encounter between European colonialism and Islam,]{.underline}**
[which emerged from the Western colonization of Africa, the Middle East,
and Asia and is embedded in the larger context of the construction of
the "other" in Western modernity**. Islam was constructed as emblematic
of "other" peoples, cultures, and civilizations in opposition to Western
civilization,**]{.underline} Christianity, and also later Judaism in the
context of the European Inquisition, the Crusades, and sectarian wars
[and also in relation to Western capitalism and New World settler
colonialism.]{.underline} Thus, [**the evolution of historical processes
of Islamophobia, even when not named as such, is intertwined with the
development of categories of "race" as part of 18thand 19th-century
European systems of classiﬁcation of peoples** and areas of the world
that did not deserve freedom and needed European "civilization," thereby
justifying Western colonialism]{.underline}. In the New World, Christian
missionaries from Europe transplanted ideas of "barbaric inﬁdels" to
North America, superimposing them on the "heathen savages" or indigenous
peoples of North America, who needed to be civilized, according to
divine mandate. [American Orientalism and Islamophobia thus have a long
history that can be traced to the foundational Holy Land myths of the
Christian settlers]{.underline}. Eerily, **[Native Americans in the U.S.
military today have testiﬁed that occupying forces in Iraq speak of
ﬁghting in "Indian country" and "killing Indians in
Iraq,"]{.underline}** [underscoring the ways in which different forms of
racialization are superimposed in a palimpsestic notion of Manifest
Destiny.]{.underline}

### L -- Israel

#### Engagement with Israel makes us complicit in colonialism because it is the paradigm of the Western settler colonial society

**Busbridge 18** (Busbridge, Rachel. "Israel-Palestine and the Settler
Colonial 'Turn': From Interpretation to Decolonization." Theory, Culture
& Society, vol. 35, no. 1, Jan. 2018, pp. 91--115,
doi:10.1177/0263276416688544. Rachel Busbridge is a political
sociologist who received her PhD at the University of South Australia in
2010.) //bc

On this point[, it is salient to note that Israel-Palestine has
increasingly come to play an important role in the transnational
aspirations of settler colonial studies]{.underline}, which has had
significant normalizing effects in that the conflict itself is often
regarded as exemplary of 'settler colonialism as a global historical
structural force' (Collins, 2011: 30). John [Collins]{.underline}
(2011), for instance, has [accorded Palestine a prophetic role in the
global struggle against colonialism and imperialism]{.underline}. [If
Palestine is being globalized]{.underline}, he contends, [the globe is
simultaneously being 'Palestinianized]{.underline}', 98 Theory, Culture
& Society 35(1) as Israel exports military techniques and mechanisms of
surveillance and social control developed in the occupied territories to
the international marketplace (see also Halper, 2015). Similarly,
Ghassan [Hage]{.underline} (2014: 7--9) **[suggests that Israel is
emblematic of what he calls 'the globalization of the late modern
settler colonial condition',]{.underline}** [which designates a
transnational imaginary characterized by an aggressive monoculturalism
and an attempt to shore up society against the perceived barbarism of an
enemy other]{.underline}. In Hage's (2014: 9) account, **[it is the West
that is being 'Israelized',]{.underline}** **[as Israel becomes a model
of 'what dominant forces in the West, at least subliminally, \[aspire\]
to be]{.underline}**' and [the 'Israeli ethos of a besieged white
colonial settler society']{.underline} [has taken 'hold in the
generalisation of the Western conception of the self'.]{.underline}

#### The 1AC's staunch support of Palestine reproduces the 'saviour mentality' that justifies continuous settler colonialism

**Law and Flaherty 17** (Victoria Law, anarchist activist, writer,
freelance editor, photographer and mother, founder of Books Through
Bars-New York City, a group that sends free books to prisoners
nationwide, facilitator of incarcerated women's writings through editing
and teaching, Jordan Flaherty, award-winning journalist, producer, and
author, lectured at dozens of colleges, universities and conferences, he
was a part of the editorial collective that published Left Turn
Magazine, a publication that reported from progressive and revolutionary
movements around the world, January 8, 2017, "How Savior Mentality
Stands in the Way of Solidarity Organizing: An Interview With Jordan
Flaherty,"

[[In the real world, people don't need heroes or rescue: They need
systemic solutions to racism, patriarchy, colonialism and capitalism.
But the seductive myth of the savior complex all too often leads us
astray,]{.underline} as Jordan Flaherty shows in No More Heroes:
Grassroots Challenges to the Savior Mentality. Robin D.G. Kelley calls
this book "A perfect gift for the age of
Trump."](https://org2.salsalabs.com/o/6694/t/17304/shop/item.jsp?storefront_KEY=661&t=&store_item_KEY=3436)
"[Social movements have an unfortunate history of following the
leadership of charismatic hero figures]{.underline}," writes Jordan
Flaherty, a social justice organizer, journalist, producer and author.
"[I've come to think of this as the savior mentality; the idea that a
hero will come and answer our societal problems,]{.underline} [like
Superman rescuing Lois Lane, or a fireman rescuing a kitten from a
tree."]{.underline} In his new book No More Heroes: Grassroots
Challenges to the Savior Mentality, [Flaherty examines how the savior
mentality has permeated movements for social justice and been used by
the state to undermine gains won by decades of organizing.]{.underline}
He traces the history of the savior, reaching all the way back to 1096
CE, [when the Pope launched the Crusades under the guise of saving
"heathens"]{.underline} (read: Jewish, Muslim and other non-Christian
people[) to post-Katrina New Orleans where Brandon Darby, who later
announced his role as an FBI informant, rose to power and influence
among activists seeking to rebuild while wide-eyed Teach for America
volunteers displaced seasoned (and unionized) African American
teachers.]{.underline} But No More Heroes isn't simply about the
problems and pitfalls inherent in the savior mentality. While Flaherty
documents the numerous ways in which people with the best of intentions
confuse charity with solidarity, he also highlights grassroots efforts
to build systemic changes that are accountable to the communities most
impacted. Some of these movements have been spearheaded by those most
directly affected, such as high school students across New Orleans who
organized walk-outs to protest the replacing of veteran African American
teachers with inexperienced (and predominantly white) Teach for America
recruits and punitive school discipline policies, and sex workers
fighting both repressive policing and programs that seek to "save" them
by arresting them. Flaherty also explores ways in which organizers have
worked together to connect issues. He recounts a 1995 protest against
proposed budget cuts for the City University of New York (CUNY) in which
he and other CUNY students were arrested for blocking the road to the
Battery Park Tunnel connecting Brooklyn and Manhattan. While in jail, he
learned that dozens of other groups had simultaneously blocked nearly
every entrance into and out of Manhattan. These were not other student
organizations, but organizers from [ACT-UP](http://www.actupny.org/)
protesting cuts to health care, disability rights activists protesting
service cuts, activists from [CAAAV](http://caaav.org/about-us) (then
known as Committee Against Anti-Asian Violence) and the [National
Congress for Puerto Rican
Rights](http://www.columbia.edu/~rmg36/NCPRR.html) protesting police
brutality, and many other groups. These simultaneous direct actions were
not accidental; instead, Flaherty explains, the "leadership from each of
these organizations had met together and planned this action as a way to
build unity in a sometimes fractured movement." [The recent election
underlines the importance, if not urgency, of solidarity organizing and
reminds us of the need to avoid the pitfalls of searching for a
savior.]{.underline} Flaherty ends on an optimistic note and a call to
action, which resonate now more than ever: "The changes we fear are
impossible are already growing. [We can build a better world, as long as
we don't fall into traps of reform that leave out those who are most in
need. If we listen to those who have the most to lose, and stand in
principled struggle with those on the bottom, everything is
possible]{.underline}." Victoria Law: What was your initial reason for
writing No More Heroes? Why now? Jordan Flaherty: I'm very excited by
this movement moment we are in, by the protests at Standing Rock, by
Black Lives Matter, by the disability justice and Latinx and trans
movements, and so much more. And I wanted to create another resource for
people who want to support those movements. I work as a journalist, and
try to do my work in a way that's accountable to social movements. One
question I ask myself is, what is my role as white, cisgender, male
journalist reporting on movements like sex worker rights and Black Lives
Matter? One answer is, I can speak to other people coming from positions
of privilege, and critique issues that I have seen come up in my own
life and work, and in the work of other people with privilege. [This
savior mentality is something I have seen come up again and again. In US
volunteers in Palestine.]{.underline} In post-Katrina Teach For America
corps members in New Orleans. In social workers seeking to "save" sex
workers through partnering with police to arrest them. [I think it's
crucial for people with privilege to confront this savior
mentality.]{.underline}

### L - Latin America

#### Latin America is entrenched in a historical foundation of settler violence

**Gott**, Richard. "Latin America as a White Settler Society." Bulletin
of Latin American Research, vol. 26, no. 2, 20**07**, pp. 269--289.,
[www.jstor.org/stable/27733923](http://www.jstor.org/stable/27733923).
// nsp

[The term \'Latin America\' was]{.underline} itself [coined]{.underline}
in the middle of the nineteenth century[, at the very moment of white
settler expansion]{.underline}. \'Latinit?\' or \'Latinidad\' was
constructed by French intellectuals and taken over with alacrity by the
white elite in South America. Walter Mignolo, in The Idea of Latin
America\', perceives it as a profoundly reaction ary and colonial
concept that gave prominence to the population of European or Latin
descent while effectively rubbing-out the Indians and the Blacks
(Mignolo, 2005: 57-72). [The term firmly locates Latin America in the
white world of the West, where it remains to this day, ignoring the
presence of its Black and indigenous peoples]{.underline}. It
successfully replaced the visionary and more inclusive projects of Simon
Bolivar and Jose Marti, who talked, respectively, of a \'Confederation
of Spanish American Nations\' and of \'Nuestra America\' to distinguish
the southern from the northern hemisphere. [My purpose]{.underline} here
[is to reinsert Latin America into the frame of reference used when
discussing]{.underline} other [colonial experiences]{.underline} in the
last 200 years, when [similarities between the white settler phenomena
across the globe are most marked]{.underline}. My argument is that
[Latin America should not be seen as]{.underline} a continent
[conveniently set apart]{.underline} - as the out come of its long
experience of Spanish and Portuguese settlement since the sixteenth
century - [but should be included in the general history of the global
expansion of white settler populations]{.underline} from all over Europe
in the more recent period. Thus [what follows]{.underline} [looks at
white settler attitudes]{.underline} today [in]{.underline} a handful of
[Latin American countries,]{.underline} at the present-day indigenous
awakening, and at the definition of \'settler colonialism\', a concept
now widely used in other contexts. I then return to the nineteenth
century to examine the white settler obsession with Europe at the
expense of the local population, and the fierce settler rejection of the
reformist and inclusive projects once put forward by their former
metropolitan governments. [I]{.underline} also [look at]{.underline} the
other side of the coin, [the indigenous policies of the
post-independence radicals]{.underline}, the anti-racist philosophy of
Sim?n Rodr?guez, and the achievements in Paraguay of Rodr?guez de
Francia. Finally, I examine the white settler counter-revolution of the
nineteenth century, and its project of white immigration and indigenous
extermination.

### L -- Liberalism

#### **Liberalism is bad -- it organizes countries into colonial orders to be controlled by the hierarchically dominant US**

**Kosasa 2004** (Kosasa, Eiko. "Predatory Politics: US Imperialism,
Settler Hegemony, and the Japanese in Hawai'I." August 2004.

//bc

Lenin insightfully noted that [an imperialist nation cannot be predatory
in its foreign polices while simultaneously democratic in domestic
policies]{.underline}. He It is fundamentally un-Marxist and
unscientific to single out policy to home policy. Both in reign and home
policy, [imperialism strives towards violations of democracy, towards
reaction]{.underline}. In this sense, [imperialism is indisputably the
\"negation\" of democracy in general,]{.underline} of all democracy,
[and not just of one of its demands, national
self-determination]{.underline}. The U S. policies are clear examples
that American imperialism negates democracy abroad and at home. First,
[in the international context,]{.underline} US**[. foreign policies
assault other nations militarily or financially, violating the
international right of self-determination]{.underline}**. Lenin
describes these acts of aggression as clearly undemocratic.
[Imperialism]{.underline} by definition, **[creates hierarchies among
nations and prevents less powerful and / or colonized countries from
representing themselves and their interests]{.underline}**. Second,
[foreign policies toward American-occupied Native nations are
categorized as domestic policies, which deny Native peoples the human
right of national self-determinatio]{.underline}n. Third, American
domestic policies deny citizens, (whether Native or settler), equal
access to education, job opportunities, and housing. Preferential
treatment is always enjoyed by the settler bourgeoisie. A 1996 statistic
documents the well-known reality that one percent of the population owns
forty percent of the wealth in the United States. 9 [A miniscule portion
of Americans exerts more economic and political influence over the
leaders of the country than the vast majority of ordinary
citizens.]{.underline} Obviously, this illuminating statistic reveals
that the United States is not a land of opportunity because only one
percent of the population has access to almost half the wealth in the
country. **[Within American society, then, democracy]{.underline}**
(equal access and equal representation) **[is
non-existent]{.underline}**. Marxist cultural theorist, Raymond
Williams, describes [the dominant culture as the \"central
system]{.underline} [of practices, meanings and values]{.underline}\"
[which does more than just represent ruling class interests: it
organizes society]{.underline}. As a component of hegemony, national
culture educates citizens to accept ruling class values as their own.
Williams calls this \"the process of incorporation.\" That is to say,
[when these cultural practices are \"experienced\" and \"lived,\" they
reconfirm for citizens \"a sense of reality\" about the bourgeois regime
under which they exist]{.underline}. The process of
[incorporation]{.underline}, then, [is an important aspect of hegemony
because citizens accept, participate, and thus validate the national
culture of the ruling class .]{.underline}

### L - Linguistics

#### Settler colonialism expands beyond history to influence linguistics

Accessed 6/25/2019//SR

[Generally speaking, postcolonial theories and theories of coloniality
attend to two forms of colonialism]{.underline}2 . External colonialism
(also called exogenous or exploitation colonization) denotes the
expropriation of fragments of Indigenous worlds, animals, plants and
human beings, extracting them in order to transport them to - and build
the wealth, the privilege, or feed the appetites of - the colonizers,
who get marked as the first world. This includes so-thought 'historic'
examples such as opium, spices, tea, sugar, and tobacco, the extraction
of which continues to fuel colonial efforts. This form of colonialism
also includes the feeding of contemporary appetites for diamonds, fish,
water, oil, humans turned workers, genetic material, cadmium and other
essential minerals for high tech devices. [External colonialism often
requires a subset of activities properly called military colonialism -
the creation of war fronts/frontiers against enemies to be conquered,
and the enlistment of foreign land, resources, and people into military
operations. In external colonialism, all things Native become recast as
'natural resources' - bodies and earth for war, bodies and earth for
chattel. The other form of colonialism that is attended to by
postcolonial theories and theories of coloniality is internal
colonialism, the biopolitical and geopolitical management of people,
land, flora and fauna within the "domestic" borders of the imperial
nation]{.underline}. This involves the use of 2 Colonialism is not just
a symptom of capitalism. Socialist and communist empires have also been
settler empires (e.g. Chinese colonialism in Tibet). "In other words,"
[writes Sandy Grande]{.underline}, "both Marxists and capitalists view
land and [natural resources as commodities to be exploited, in the first
instance, by capitalists for personal gain, and in the second by
Marxists for the good of all"]{.underline} (2004, p.27). Capitalism and
the state are technologies of colonialism, developed over time to
further colonial projects. Racism is an invention of colonialism (Silva,
2007). The current colonial era goes back to 1492, when colonial
imaginary goes global. Decolonization is not a metaphor 5 particularized
modes of control - prisons, ghettos, minoritizing, schooling, policing -
to ensure the ascendancy of a nation and its white3 elite[. These modes
of control, imprisonment, and involuntary transport of the human beings
across borders - ghettos, their policing, their economic divestiture,
and their dislocatability -]{.underline} are at work to authorize the
metropole and conscribe her periphery. [Strategies of internal
colonialism, such as segregation, divestment, surveillance, and
criminalization, are both structural and interpersonal.]{.underline}

#### Isolating instances of scholarly reform within colonial structures establishes a method of micro-political resistance outside presupposed linguistic practices.

**Bhatnagar 86-** Rashmi Bhatnagar is a professor at the University of
Pittsburg. (July 1986, "Uses and Limits of Foucault: A Study of the
Theme of Origins in Edward Said\'s \'Orientalism\'",
[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3517247
//](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3517247%20//) RC)

For Said the Foucauldian definition of discourse \'differs from all this
in its affirmativeness, its pro-aggressive, and its energetic
discoveries\' (p. 342). What are the energetic discoveries Said
perceives in Foucault seems to me that it would be misleading to examine
the Foucauldian conception of discourse without also considering the
other end of the pole which always and everywhere for Foucault is the
structure of power? Foucault has tried to [think through the relations
between power knowledge by rupturing the habitual ways of thinking about
power on law]{.underline} (what is legitimate and illegitimate power?)
[and institutional models]{.underline} (what is the state?). Thus,
Foucault proposes a new economy power-relations from the point of view
not of its internal rationality (what it says about the need for its
existence) but the \'antagonism of strategies.\' Foucault\'s intention
is an [analysis of power not from its universal and universalizing
origins but its origins in the other it represses and
out-laws.]{.underline} [The specific forms of resistance define and
describe the specific configurations of power.]{.underline} [To speak of
power from the position of resistance to it, is to valorize the
perceptions of the resisting people or group to take up a combative and
subversive position against its influence.]{.underline} Consider for
instance the flexible position it allows Said in the study of
nineteenth-century philology. Said is able to violate the hermetically
sealed space of philology and its claims of grandeur by recognizing the
power-relations hidden under its disinterested search for truth.
Speaking of Renan, [he notices the imperial sweep of assumption: \"He
constructs, and the very act of construction is a sign of imperial power
over recalcitrant phenomena, as well as a confirmation of the dominating
culture and its \'naturalization.\']{.underline} Indeed, it is not too
much to say that Renan\'s philological laboratory is the actual locale
of his European ethnocentrism (pp. 145-46). The continuing prestige of a
discipline like Orientalism or its parent-discipline nineteenth-century
philology will not allow the decoding of its power-relations in the
political languages we speak. Said can **[describe the tyranny of
colonial power only by gauging its productivity at the level where it is
materialized temporally-spatially into a technology institution or a
micro-practice.]{.underline}** It is precisely at this theoretical
juncture that Foucault [rejoin the materialist tradition, at the point
where he envisions power/knowledge as discernible only in their
material, bodily and institutional practices.]{.underline} Foucault\'s
particular interest is in the material form are secreted around a
discourse at the exact moment of its institutionalization. Thus we are
made aware of the process by which philology and anthropology acquire
the power of self-perpetuation through the archive, the library, the
Asiatic society and its modern avatar in area- studies. Philology in its
[nineteenth-century manifestation invented a doctrine (unlocking the
roots of esoteric languages popularized as reduced model of the Oriental
by which Oriental languages are reduced to their linguistic roots, then
further reduced to a matter of race, racial character, thus
reintroducing]{.underline}, as Said says, [the prejudices of racial type
and stereotype by a new and impeccable strategy) and also an
institutional site.]{.underline} Said this institutional site, in Ernest
Renan\'s case, [consisted of the sealed space of pedagogic practice-the
class room in which he instructed initiate reinforced by the sealed
space of the library and the archive**. Language as it circulates in
these institutional sites is obsessed by origins but never questions the
privilege of its statement**]{.underline}. Said argues that similar
impulses were operative in nineteenth cent anthropology. The discursive
hierarchy in Sacy\'s writings posits the relation between the
Orientalist and the Oriental as one in which the former writes, whereas
the latter is written about. Anthropology is essentialist in its
founding presuppositions, for it reduces every discrete act of the
Oriental\'s behavior under study to a predictable pre-existing
Orientalist essence. Religious-ethnic categories are the basic unit of
analysis and only secondarily is the socio-economic category employed.
The arbitrariness of the premises of anthropology in the school of
Silvestre de Sacy, has been sardonically commented on by Claude Alvarez:
the study of the white man is sociology, all the rest is anthropology
(Homo Faber). [The effectiveness of colonial discourse lies in its
ability to veil its \'lowly\' origins, to invisibilise its institutional
sittings and deflect attention from its material existence.]{.underline}
To combat this tendency Foucault emphasizes the role of non-discursive
elements in constituting a discourse. [Thus he speaks of individual
texts as statement-events in order to call attention, in Said\'s words,
to \'their status as events, and also their density as things- that is,
their duration, and paradoxically, their monumentality, their characters
as monuments.\']{.underline}\"5 Foucault defines the materiality
specific to discourse: [\'The rule of materiality that statements obey
is therefore of the order of the institution **rather than of the
spatio-temporal localization, it defines the possibilities of
re-inscription and transcription-the schemata of use constitutes a field
of stabilization**]{.underline}.\'16 Thus Said makes abundantly clear in
his Introduction that his purpose is not to recover a reality behind the
European distortions and mis-representations, but instead to focus
steadily on the production of the Orient as a textual construct. To
quote Said: \'It is clear, I hope, that my concern with authority does
not entail analyses of what lies hidden in the Orientalist text, but
analysis rather of the text\'s surface, its exteriority to what it
describes\' (p. 20). [In repudiating \'what lies hidden in the
Orientalist text\' Said is working towards a dismantling of the entire
machinery of origins, inasmuch as this machinery dictates a specific way
of apprehending reality in terms of depths and surfaces. Within this
cognitive metaphor which clothes all our thinking, the past is perceived
as a surface, and analysis assumes the unconscious arrogance of
discovering its depth or inner meaning.]{.underline} Some of
[these]{.underline} influential theoretical [positions]{.underline}
regarding [origins have]{.underline} thus [provided]{.underline} Said
with [a point of entry into the ongoing critique of colonialism and
post-colonialism. The Third-World intellectual must grasp the entire
cause and effect machinery of origins and the different knottings
produced in it.]{.underline} It remains to be seen what Said\'s claim of
liberation to-does it remain an imitation of Foucauldian
self-consciousness while trapped within the constituting paradoxes of
the Western philosophical tradition? Furthermore, if all roads lead to
false origins, where does inquiry begin without being implicated in
false origins? These are some of the questions and the area of address
of the next s Said\'s provisional beginning or point of incision in
Orientalism is not so much a re-inscription of the motivations of
European mercantile capitalism, as the emergence of a new \'field\' of
knowledge known as Orientalist studies The concept of a field is the
fundamental organizing principle in Foucault\'s writings, and at the
simplest level of resonance Foucault intends a \'field\' to mean the
formal conditions which make the appearance of meaning possible. Right
away one can discern the gains of locating knowledge in the field of its
historical practice, in that which grants it an official voice and the
political context of power relations in which this voice situates
itself. [The notion of a field is primarily a notion of
space,]{.underline} and Foucault\'s [dominant concern is with the
element of space in which language and thought occur.]{.underline} His
studies have [consistently been addressed to their formation as
discursive fields, in]{.underline} Gayatri Spivak\'s phrase as
\'power-in-space.\'1In conceiving Orientalist studies as a field or a
[power-in-space]{.underline} Said has seized a [peculiarly effective
strategy to make Orientalist studies visible as a monument]{.underline}
in the Foucauldian sense-its symmetry [of assumptions, metaphors, binary
oppositions, even its physical solidity and power of interference. There
is a certain ironic fit in the methodological apparatus of a \'field\'
as applied to the narrative of colonization:]{.underline} Said [seems to
be gesturing towards the imperial aggrandizement of space-both outer
geographical space of the colonized country and inner psychic space of
the colonized people.]{.underline} The notion of a field also tends to
create startling relationships of similitude and difference between
those who are made visible and those who are invisibilized. By no means
is the diachronic framework denied or obscured; in fact, the Foucauldian
field pays attention to the timeframe internal to a field.

### L - Multiculturalism 

#### Celebrations of inclusion, multiculturism, and diversity are complicit with state-led organizations that only further exclusion

**Greensmith**, Cameron. ( 20**18**) Desiring Diversity: The Limits of
White Settler Multiculturalism in Queer Organizations. Studies in
Ethnicity and Nationalism, 18: 57-- 77. doi: 10.1111/sena.12264. // nsp

[In discussing the inclusion of gays and lesbians]{.underline} in the
'Who We Are' section of Discover Canada, Maureen FitzGerald and Scott
Rayter (2012:xvi) ask: '[Where are bisexual, transgender, or
two‐spirited people]{.underline}? And, in [this great story in which
diversity and multiculturalism are celebrated, what precisely is the
"common identity" we all share]{.underline}?'. Here [the authors point
to the explicit erasure of bisexual, transgender, and 2‐Spirit2
people]{.underline} [in]{.underline} Canadian
[multiculturalism]{.underline}, marking the seeming need for Canadian
citizens and newcomers alike to share some kind of 'common identity'.
[Despite the omission of other queer, trans, and 2‐Spirit identities
outside of gay and lesbian, FitzGerald and Rayter]{.underline}
(2012:xvii) [contend, 'most queer people would likely agree]{.underline}
that [adding a reference to sexual diversity is]{.underline} an
[important]{.underline} message to the rest of the world. Indeed, many
Canadians take pride in this image of ourselves and would see the
addition as a commitment to and representation of our core values and
freedoms'. A [challenge lies behind the acceptance of such
inclusion]{.underline}, as it requires that queer recognition and
inclusion are rejoiced at through an investment in Canada\'s violent
present. [Emphasizing Canada\'s goodness]{.underline} in this [case can
obscure the white settler colonial conditions that were and continue to
be founded upon the death, disappearance, and assimilation of Indigenous
peoples,]{.underline}3 [as well as the integration and torture of people
of colour]{.underline}4 (Cannon and Sunseri 2011; Greensmith, 2016;
Kouri and Skott‐Myhre, 2016; Razack 2008; Razack, Smith, and Thobani
2011; Schick and McNinch 2009; Thobani 2007). As such, [the (white) gays
and lesbians included within this new imagining of]{.underline} Canadian
[multiculturalism are considered nationals who]{.underline} benefit from
and [contribute]{.underline} to the Canadian economy and political life
--- and [to Canada\'s image of itself. The inclusion of gays and
lesbians in]{.underline} official [multiculturalism acts to
shift]{.underline} popular [perceptions around]{.underline} desiring and
[needing]{.underline} [diversity]{.underline}, [rather than challenging
the ways diversity]{.underline} (often coded as multiculturalism, or
vice versa) [is used to sustain racial difference and settler colonial
oppression]{.underline}. [The use of diversity]{.underline} within the
national order of things --- including education and the everyday ---
[can obscure the ways that social service organizations are deeply
embedded in and sustain whiteness]{.underline}. To address this
oversight, this paper asks: what utility does diversity have in queer
communities in Canada? And, in what ways is diversity used and imagined
on the ground by non‐Indigenous5 LGBTQ people themselves? Moreover, what
consequences does diversity hold for Indigenous peoples and people of
colour? To explore these questions of diversity and its ties to larger
processes and practices of multiculturalism in Canada, I look to
[Toronto\'s queer service sector --- educational, health care, and
social service organizations]{.underline} that [are]{.underline}
committed to serving LGBTQ people and communities --- as being
[comprised of sites where whiteness is normalized and
sustained]{.underline}. [Queer service organizations are closely tied to
the state]{.underline} [through]{.underline} their [funding
structures]{.underline} that dictate how money can be spent and for
whom. [Funding]{.underline} (private and public) typically [propels
organizations into relationships with the state,]{.underline} and the
queer service sector works within these confines by creating
population‐specific programming and support for all LGBTQ people in the
city. To examine how the [discourse of diversity is used and
(re)appropriated by non‐Indigenous LGBTQ service providers,]{.underline}
I begin by briefly outlining how diversity is shaped by official
multicultural discourse in Canada. I discuss my methodological
framework, used to explore the ways that queer politics and communities
rely on inclusion, recognition, and diversity. Next, I situate the
narratives of non‐Indigenous LGBTQ service provider research
participants within a larger theoretical discussion of the discourse of
diversity. Finally, the implications of desiring diversity within queer
communities and queer service organizations in Toronto are noted.
Overall, this paper addresses the ways [multiculturalism]{.underline} in
Canada is desired and how it [plays out within queer
communities]{.underline} through the use of diversity [as a tactic to
create further exclusion]{.underline}.

#### Multiculturalism is a tool used to frame the state as one of innocence, untainted by its racist history and settler colonial foundation -- it creates a national identity implicitly ties to race, otherizing indigenous peoples and people of color

**Greensmith**, Cameron. ( 20**18**) Desiring Diversity: The Limits of
White Settler Multiculturalism in Queer Organizations. Studies in
Ethnicity and Nationalism, 18: 57-- 77. doi: 10.1111/sena.12264. // nsp

Multicultural' Tensions: Diversity, Recognition, or Racism? Official
multiculturalism emerged in Canada in 1971, first as a policy under
Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau, and second, in 1988, as law within
the official Multicultural Act under Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, to
address linguistic, cultural, and land‐based disputes within the nation
(Day 2000; Mackey 2002; St. Denis 2011). Official
[multiculturalism]{.underline} was first implemented as an imagined and
very real creation of a cultural mosaic --- a strategic move away from
the United States' melting pot (Dion 2009; Mackey 2002; Simpson, James,
and Mack, 2011). This move [created a falsified image of
Canada]{.underline} (and its people) that is deeply [rooted in notions
of innocence, whereby Canada has only taken part in peaceful engagements
with Indigenous peoples, and has never exercised racism within its
immigration practices. While research has documented the realities of
racism and settler colonialism in Canada\'s history and present, the
construction of a good and innocent Canadian citizen remains deeply
entrenched in the imagery of Canada itself.]{.underline}
[Multiculturalism]{.underline}, in other words, was meant to enter into
the fabric of everyday life, and [has become institutionalized and
normalized in an attempt to 'design a unified nation']{.underline}
(Chazan et al. 2011:3). As Rinaldo Walcott (2011:136) argued,
multiculturalism has indeed become the 'fundamental characteristic of
Canadian heritage and identity'. [Multiculturalism allows]{.underline}
Canadian [citizen‐subjects to erase historical and contemporary white
supremacist and settler colonial processes and practices]{.underline}.
As Sunera Thobani (2007:154) so aptly put it, '[multiculturalism allowed
Canadians to resolve the crisis of whiteness through]{.underline} its
\[Canada\'s\] [reorganization as]{.underline} tolerant, [pluralist, and
racially innocent, uncontaminated by its previous racist
history']{.underline}. The ideological and discursive use of
multiculturalism produces a Canada that is inclusive, diverse, and
tolerant, and which 'celebrat\[es\] . . . differences' (Dion 2009:74).
This particular mantra of celebration has become the central pillar for
constructing a Canadian national identity. But [within this celebration
of differences lies an essential homogenization of the population,
creating a core Canadian culture, whereby Indigenous peoples and people
of colour have been made to become Others]{.underline} within the
nation. [Multiculturalism has been put in place to manage the country\'s
internal differences by maintaining]{.underline} its core culture --- [a
white settler nation]{.underline} established by two 'founding nations'
(the British and French) (Day 2000; Mackey 2002; Thobani 2007; Walcott
2011). In sustaining narratives and imaginations of early conquest,
[this core culture places the power and control into the hands of
whites, while Others --- those who are Indigenous and/or of colour ---
are considered secondary, included within the nation so long as they
assimilate and become 'Canadian'.]{.underline} Thus, [multiculturalism
is used to bring difference together under the rubric of
diversity]{.underline}, and [anyone who exists outside]{.underline} of
this narrative [is required to assimilate, and is simultaneously
constructed as an outsider due to their culture]{.underline} (Bannerji
2000; Razack 2008). [The]{.underline} particular [focus on multiculture
is the mechanism that erases Indigenous peoples']{.underline} own
[unique articulations of Indigenous nationhood and sovereignty by
requiring an investment in white settler colonial
institutions]{.underline} ([e.g. The Indian Act]{.underline}) (Cannon
and Sunseri 2011; Coulthard 2007; Lawrence and Dua 2005; St. Denis
2011). As Thobani (2007:175) so aptly argued, '[state‐sponsored
multiculturalism compels \[Indigenous peoples\] to negotiate and
comprehend their identities on]{.underline} very [narrow
grounds]{.underline}, discouraging and possibly [foreclosing the
possibility of]{.underline} alliances that might allow [a systemic
challenge to white dominance,]{.underline} patriarchy, and global
corporate capitalism'. Official [multiculturalism]{.underline} --- and
subsequent iterations of multicultural diversity --- [erases Indigenous
peoples' experiences of white settler colonialism to trace them as
belonging to a 'special interest group' that is produced as one cultural
group amongst many]{.underline} (Cannon and Sunseri 2011; Lawrence and
Dua 2005; Porter 1999; St. Denis 2011; Thobani 2007). The sole focus on
culture erases the divergent struggles amongst Indigenous communities
and communities of colour, while perpetuating the common understanding
of communities as distinctly and culturally separate. The power of
[multiculturalism sustains cultural difference]{.underline} in Canada.
Eva Mackey (2002:20) provided a rich analysis [of Canadian]{.underline}
'core [identity']{.underline} as [being comprised of
'Canadian‐Canadians',]{.underline} [a]{.underline} term used by white
folks she interviewed to indicate their ordinariness --- an 'unmarked,
non‐ethnic, and usually [white . . . identity']{.underline}. As a result
of such conceptualizations, the (presumed) [whiteness]{.underline} of
nationals [becomes normalized]{.underline}, effectively producing
Indigenous peoples and people of colour as Others. This has grave
consequences for how Canadian identity is regulated and policed[. The
assimilation required of Indigenous peoples and people of colour
produces]{.underline} Canada and its [imaginings of citizenship to be
only white. The presence of]{.underline} people of colour and Indigenous
peoples within this nation that is 'celebrating of difference' continues
to be viewed as compromising the whiteness of the Canadian nation‐state
(Thobani 2007). In other words, '[multiculturalism is]{.underline}
itself [a politics of settlement']{.underline} (Chazan et al. 2011:1).
While evocations of diversity and difference invite Canadian
citizen‐subjects to desire the allure of multiculturalism, [the process
of white settlement through which Canada was founded remains
immune]{.underline} from scrutiny. Indeed, the use of diversity ---
requiring, [needing, and wanting diversity --- obscures the realities of
the structural whiteness embedded within institutions and
organizations]{.underline} (Ahmed 2012). Instead of working towards
challenging structures of domination that continue to deride and
repudiate the well‐being of Indigenous peoples and people of colour,
diversity is used to bring attention to difference --- attention that
can emerge as an empty gesture of inclusion, or a problematic politics
of recognition, as will be discussed below. It is thus through the
discourse of diversity --- and the desire for it --- that the Canadian
nation‐state holds whiteness at its centre, by creating cultural/racial
groups as Others who are at once celebrated and marginalized due to
their differences. The desire for diversity within multicultural Canada
is deeply embedded within a politics of recognition. Nancy Fraser\'s
(2000) theorization of recognition becomes useful in thinking through
ways diversity is utilized within queer communities in Toronto. In
particular, for Fraser, recognition naturalizes the production of
difference, where being recognized is only validated through some sort
of naming. Combining recognition with Louis Althusser\'s (1971:162--163)
concept of interpellation --- the police officer uttering 'Hey, you
there' to call on a citizen with no recognition or naming --- allows for
the understanding of how the (white) authoritarian is placed in a
power‐over relationship with the citizen‐subject. A politics of naming
allows for the subject to be differentiated while simultaneously
constituted as different through this process (Ahmed 2000). So, bringing
this all back to the concept of diversity, as this comes to mean many
things, but typically resides within recognition of culture (e.g. the
3‐D approach: dress, dance, and dining \[Srivastava 2007\]), [people of
colour and Indigenous peoples come to exist on the colonizers'
terms]{.underline} alone. In other words, [diversity]{.underline}
further [normalizes racial and settler colonial hierarchies, which
places emphasis on the capacity of white settlers to recognize and know
culture]{.underline} (Coulthard 2007; Povinelli 2002) --- what I refer
to as racial descriptors of non‐whiteness. For Glen Coulthard (2007),
the politics of recognition is used to downplay Indigenous peoples as
self‐determining, further naturalizing the on‐going conquest that
Indigenous peoples and nations face in Canada. And, [while the politics
of recognition is entrenched within the discourse of
diversity]{.underline} contained in Canada\'s imaginings of itself and
its citizen‐subjects, it also plays out and operates differently within
different spaces, places, and organizations. Thus, returning back to the
object of inquiry --- queer communities --- they are not immune from the
racist and [settler colonial underpinnings of the politics of
recognition embedded within the desire for diversity.]{.underline} The
desire to be recognized and named is an important aspect of discourses
of multiculturalism, within which (certain) inclusive queer politics
reside.

### L -- Oil securitization

#### Securitization of oil supplies is inextricably linked to violence against Indigenous populations

**Bosworth 19** (Bosworth, Kai. \"The Dakota Access pipeline struggle:
Vulnerability, security, and settler colonialism in the oil
assemblage.\" 2019. Settling the Bakken Boom. Kai Bosworth is a human
geographer interested in new forms of environmentalism emerging from
struggles over oil pipelines.) //bc

Rather than conceiving of the oil world as a distinct industry involved
solely in the production, distribution, and marketing of oil, Michael
[Watts helpfully describes an oil assemblage as a broad and global web
"with particular properties, actors, networks, governance structures,
institutions, and organizations]{.underline}" (2012, 441). [Such a
framework allows us to trace the shifting and uneven relationships among
institutions and actors heavily involved in the oil world,]{.underline}
but not by definition. These could include environmental permitting
firms, marketing and 5 advertising firms, news outlets and internet
websites, financiers, and contractors of all kinds. [The oil assemblage
also opens the set of relations to include infrastructures, landscapes,
ecologies, and the oil itself]{.underline}. Yet untangling the oil
assemblage can be extremely than it initially seems, for some of its
institutions are more or less particular to the transnational oil
assemblage, others the products of the specific spatialities, and still
others opaque due to secrecy and security[. The description of an
assemblage or network can also give the idea that everything within the
oil assemblage is equally related to everything else, or that the entire
operation is so "gargantuan"]{.underline} (Watts 2012, 441) [that it
changes slowly or is even unchangeable]{.underline}. [Yet if instead we
follow points of crisis and instability, the concept of an oil
assemblage can helpfully guide an analysis of its "various interrelated
parts subject to change and destabilization" (]{.underline}Haarstad and
Wanvik 2017, 433). The set of institutions, practices, and flows is
tenuous, not impermeable. Like Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, we
might think of the social assemblage itself "as when you drill a hole in
a pipe, there is no social system that does not leak from all
directions" (1987, 204). [Institutions, bodies, materials, and
ideologies come into conflict with one another and are thus transformed
or stabilized]{.underline}. Massive amounts of [work must go in to
keeping the oil assemblage working]{.underline}, [and the introduction
of new elements, technologies, and populations into its webs can
significantly modify the knots of power or incapacity it
produces]{.underline}. [The political upshot of an analysis of this kind
is that one might be provoked to examine in more detail the contingent
or necessary way in which diverse institutions and practices like
futures markets, international private security forces, or environmental
permitting firms get bound with and are transformed through their
relations with the oil world]{.underline}. Consequently, one can be
better attuned especially to the spatially-situated or context-dependent
relations oil infrastructure firms must uphold in order to produce
security, broadly construed. [Securing the flow of oil through force and
violence is essential to maintaining the viability of the oil assemblage
to deliver on its promises -- namely, the production of
value]{.underline}. Thus the [institutions that attempt to produce oil
security are a particularly important part of the oil assemblage that
deserve special consideration.]{.underline} Historians and social
scientists have convincingly argued that security is one of the
principle concerns of firms and states managing flows of oil (Bridge and
Le Billon 2013; Mitchell 2013). Security must be conceived not only in
the ordering of sites of oil extraction, but also in the perception of
threats to both infrastructure and capital investment, like from an
imagined future terror attack or climate change legislation (Labban 6
2011; Zalik 2010). The specific manner in which oil and its value is
secured from interruption by locals, sub-state militias, other states,
natural disasters, or market volatility undoubtedly varies from place to
place. [This necessity for securing the infrastructure of oil has made
blockade and sabotage of oil pipelines in particular a very important
tactic for gaining political pow]{.underline}er, from the rupture of the
Mosul-Haifa pipeline during the Palestinian general strike of 1936 (Malm
2017) to today's global movement of nonviolent resistance to fossil
fuels which Naomi Klein terms "blockadia" (2014). In [response to
overwhelming necessity to secure oil, **states have turned to more or
less official means of criminalization of dissent**]{.underline} (Le
Billon and Carter 2012) **[and maintenance of structural violence,
brutality, murder, and war]{.underline}** (Zalik 2004; Watts 2001)
**[that has specifically targeted indigenous peoples and especially
indigenous women]{.underline}** (Wilson 2014). Globally, security
spending for oil and gas infrastructure is estimated to top \$30 billion
annually (Federman 2015)

### L -- Policymaking

#### The Discovery Doctrine is embedded structures of colonial policy \<\<mechanism\>\> that has real implications today\-- especially in its exploitation of Indian Law.

**Miller '05---**Robert J. Miller is a professor at Arizona State
University and his areas of expertise are civil procedure, federal
Indian law, American Indians and international law. (4/8/2011),
"Christianity, American Indians, and the Doctrine of Discovery",
https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1803674//RC)

[The Doctrine of Discovery is not just an interesting historical relic.
The Doctrine is actively applied by the United States **to Indians and
tribes today** and is a major component of modern day federal Indian
law.]{.underline} Commentators have noted, in fact, that the [Court's
opinion in *Johnson* was "to influence all subsequent thinking" in
federal Indian law.]{.underline} Consequently, [Discovery still
**impacts** and limits tribal sovereign and real property **rights
today**.]{.underline} [We will see that the vestiges of Dsicovery are
reflected in far more than just "Indian]{.underline} title," **[but that
they are also evident in the two hundred plus years of United States
Indian policies and the basic fundamental principles of federal Indian
law.]{.underline}** There are [three fundamental Indian law
principles]{.underline} that have been developed and [followed by the
Supreme Court over a nearly two-hundred-year time span. **These
principles still control Indian law to this day**]{.underline}. [**They
flowed naturally from the Doctrine of Discovery and reflect the Doctrine
at work in modern day Indian law.** The **plenary power doctrine** holds
that Congress has **very broad authority** in Indian affairs. Thus,
Congress has authority to enact laws that adversely effect or that
benefit Indian people and tribes.]{.underline} **[This power is a
two-edged sword for tribes.]{.underline}** In the late nineteenth
century**, [Congress used this power to]{.underline}** [divide and allot
dozens of Indian reservations in an attempt to **destroy tribal
governments,**]{.underline} and in the 1950s Congress worked actively to
terminate the legal existence and federal relationship of more than one
hundred Indian tribes. Only in recent times did the Supreme Court decide
that congressional actions pursuant to its plenary power in Indian law
require even the lowest level of judicial constitutional review,
rational basis review. [Notwithstanding that level of judicial review,
and a long history of congressional acts regarding tribes and Indians,
no act of Congress has ever been overturned for exceeding its plenary
power in the Indian law arena]{.underline}. There has been extensive
discussion about the source of this congressional power. The [Supreme
Court has stated that the Indian Commerce Clause "provides Congress with
plenary power to legislate in the field of Indian affairs\..." The Court
has also pointed out that]{.underline} [plenary power comes
from]{.underline} the treaty making power, the Property Clause, the
Supremacy Clause, and the Necessary and Proper clause, which is designed
to give the federal [government the power to carry out its enumerated
powers]{.underline}. It [does not make sense, however, to allege that
the Indian Commerce Clause created a congressional plenary power over
tribes because that provision addresses only commercial issues and
concerns only the allocation of authority for dealing with tribes
between the federal and state governments. It does not on its face
affect tribal authority or rights nor does it grant Congress a sweeping
plenary power over tribes for any and all subjects. While the Court has
named several sources for the plenary power,]{.underline} it has
apparently never recognized the one source that commentators suggest,
[the Doctrine of Discovery]{.underline}. [It seems beyond question that
Discovery and the principles and justifications behind the Doctrine
helped spawn the idea that the American government should hold dominion
and domination over the Indian nations.]{.underline} The [idea that
Christianity and civilization would triumph over the Indian
nations]{.underline} was brought to this continent by England, France,
and Spain and **[remained part of the psyche of American colonial,
state, and federal governments]{.underline}**. As discussed above,
[Discovery also created the idea that European and American governments
held the fee title in lands that Indians had lived on and owned for
centuries.]{.underline} It appears **[obvious that the origin of the
plenary power idea grew naturally from Discovery principles based on
their alleged helpless and destitute conditions]{.underline}**. [The
**Court has considered the impoverished condition** of tribes, **even
when that "fact" was false,** as part of the justification for a
congressional **duty to care for Indian tribes.**]{.underline} In an
1886 case, the Court analyzed that the duty of the United States to
protect Indians, a provision in many treaties, requires that Congress
also have sufficient power over Indians and tribes to carry out its duty
of protection. This overarching power is part of the plenary power
doctrine. However one examines the subject, it appears that the
[Doctrine of Discovery and the alleged weaknesses and subjugation of
Indian tribes have played a large part in the development of the plenary
power principle.]{.underline}

### L -- Postcolonialism

#### Their attempt to posit colonialism as a past event ignores complicity in ongoing acts of violence and dispossession---this creates the same conditions to justify future colonial practices

**Todd, Ph.D. in Social Anthropology, 16**

(Zoe, Writes about fish, art, Métis legal traditions, the Anthropocene,
extinction, and decolonization in urban and prairie contexts. She also
studies human-animal relations, colonialism and environmental change in
north/western Canada; 24 March 2016, ,"An Indigenous Feminist\'s Take On
The Ontological Turn: 'Ontology' Is Just Another Word For Colonialism",
*Historical Sociology*, Volume 29, Issue, 1, pages 4-22, jwm)

So why does this all matter? Why am I so fired up at the realisation
that (some) [European thinkers are replicating Indigenous thought,
seemingly with no awareness]{.underline}? Well, it's [this little matter
of colonialism]{.underline}, see. Whereas [the European academy tends to
discuss the 'post-colonial']{.underline}, in Canada [I assure you that
we are firmly still experiencing the colonial]{.underline} (see Pinkoski
(2008) for a cogent discussion of this issue in anthropology). In 2009,
our Prime-Minister, Stephen Harper, famously claimed that Canada has 'no
history of colonialism' (Hui 2009). And yet, we struggle with the fact
that [Indigenous women experience much higher rates of
violence]{.underline} (Laboucan-Massimo2014) [than non-Indigenous
women]{.underline} (1200 Indigenous women have been murdered or gone
missing in the last forty years alone (LeBlanc 2014)), prompting cries
from the UN and other bodies for our government to address this horrific
reality). Canada's first Prime-Minister, proud Scotsman John A.
MacDonald (I refuse to apply the 'Sir') famously attempted to
operationalise [the pervasive colonial notion]{.underline} of the time
[to 'kill the Indian in the Child']{.underline} (Truth and
Reconciliation Commission of Canada ), [with the Indian residential
school system]{.underline} in Canada. Canada is only now coming around
to the realisation that through [things like residential schools, and
the deeply racist---and still legislated(!) Indian Act - that it, as a
nation was built on cultural genocide]{.underline} (Truth and
Reconciliation Commission of Canada 2015: 1) [and
dispossession]{.underline}. Given our strong British roots in Canada,
you can imagine that acknowledging legacies of cultural genocide and
colonial violence is All Very Uncomfortable and creates a lot of
hand-wringing and cognitive dissonance for those who have lived
blissfully unaware of these violences. [Ask any Indigenous person, and
you will hear that nobody from an Indigenous Nation has ever laboured
under the fantasy that Canada is post-colonial, or
benevolen]{.underline}t. Nor would we pretend that the British Empire
saddled us with solely happy, beautiful, loving legacies. For all its
excessive politeness, the British colonial moment rent and tore apart
sovereign Indigenous nations and peoples in what is now Canada, and
though the sun has set on Queen Victoria's Empire, British institutions
(including the academy) still benefit from that colonial moment. [We are
enmeshed, across the Atlantic, in ongoing colonial
legacies]{.underline}. And [in order to dismantle those legacies, we
must face our complicity head on]{.underline}. I firmly believe we can
confront these legacies with a great deal of love and accountability,
and build processes and structures that are attentive to and accountable
for the ongoing impacts of colonial rule.¶ Similarly, [with the wave of
the post-colonial wand, many European thinkers seem to have absolved
themselves of any implication in ongoing colonial realities throughout
the globe]{.underline}. And yet, [each one of us is embedded in systems
that uphold the exploitation and dispossession of Indigenous
peoples]{.underline}. The [academy plays a role in shaping the
narratives that erase ongoing colonial violence]{.underline}.My
experience in Britain has been incredibly eye-opening: as far as the
majority of Britons seem to be concerned, their responsibility for, and
implication in, colonialism in North America ended with the War of
Independence (in America) or the repatriation of the Canadian
constitution (1982). Is it so simple, though? To draw such arbitrary
lines through intergenerational suffering and colonial trauma, to
absolve the European academy and the European mind of any guilt in the
genocide of Indigenous people (if and when European and North American
actors are willing to admit it is a genocide)? And then to turn around
and use Indigenous cosmologies and knowledge systems in a so-called new
intellectual 'turn', all the while ignoring the contemporary realities
of Indigenous peoples vis-à-vis colonial nation-states, or the many
Indigenous thinkers who are themselves writing about these issues? And
is it intellectually or ethically responsible or honest to pretend that
European bodies do not still oppress Indigenous ones throughout the
world?¶ Zygmunt Bauman (1989) takes sociology to task for its role in
narrating the Holocaust, and its role in erasing our collective guilt in
the possibility for a future Holocaust to emerge. He argues that by
framing the Holocaust as either a a) one-off atrocity never to be
repeated, "a failure of modernity" (Bauman 1989: 5) or b) an inevitable
outcome of modernity, sociology enables humanity to ignore its ongoing
complicity in the conditions that created the horrors of the Holocaust.
**[The rhetoric of the post-colonial is similarly complacent: it
absolves the present generation of thinkers, politicians, lawyers, and
policy wonks for their duty to acknowledge what came
before]{.underline}**, and, in keeping with Bauman's insights, **[the
possibility it could happen again]{.underline}** --- [that within all
societies lurk the 'two faces' of humanity that can either facilitate or
quash systemic and calculated human suffering and
exploitation]{.underline}. The reality is, as Bauman asserts, that
[humanity is responsible, and humanity must be willing to face itself
and to acknowledge its role in these horrors]{.underline}. We must do so
in order to ensure we never tread the path of such destruction again. ¶
I take Bauman's words to heart, and ask my non-Indigenous peers to
consider their roles in the ongoing colonial oppression of Indigenous
peoples. **[The colonial moment has not passed]{.underline}**. The
[conditions that fostered it have not suddenly disappeared.]{.underline}
We talk of neo-colonialism, neo-Imperialism, but it is as if these are
far away things (these days these accusations are often mounted with
terse suspicion against the BRIC countries, as though the members of the
G8 have not already colonised the globe through neo-liberal economic and
political policies). [The reality is that we are just an invasion or
economic policy away from re-colonising at any moment. So it is so
important to think, deeply, about how the Ontological Turn--with its
breathless 'realisations' that animals, the climate, water,
'atmospheres' and non-human presences like ancestors and spirits are
sentient and possess agency, that 'nature' and 'culture', 'human' and
'animal' may not be so separate after all---is itself perpetuating the
exploitation of Indigenous peoples.]{.underline}

To enter the Hybrid State exhibit on Broadway, you enter The Passage.
Instead of a gallery, you find a dark antechamber, where one white word
invites you forward: COLONIALISM. To enter colonial space, you stoop
through a low door, only to be closetted in another black space - a
curatorial reminder, however fleeting, of Fanon: \"The native is a being
hemmed in.\"\' But the way out of colonialism, it seems, is forward. A
second white word, POSTCOLONIALISM, invites you through a slightly
larger door into the next stage of history, after which you emerge,
fully erect, into the brightly lit and noisy HYBRID STATE. I am
fascinated less by the exhibit itself, than by the paradox between the
idea of history that shapes \"The Passage,\" and the quite different
idea of history that shapes the \"Hybrid State\" exhibit itself. The
exhibit cele- brates \"parallel history\": Parallel history points to
the reality that there is no longer a main- stream view of American art
culture, with several \"other,\" lesser important cultures surrounding
it. Rather there exists a parallel history which is now changing our
understanding of our transcultural under- standing.2 Yet the exhibit\'s
commitment to \"hybrid history\" (multiple time) is con- tradicted by
the linear logic of The Passage (\"A Brief Route To Free- dom\"), which,
as it turns out, rehearses one of the most tenacious tropes of
colonialism. [In colonial discourse,]{.underline} as in The Passage[,
space is time, and history is shaped around two, necessary movements:
the \"progress\" for- ward of humanity from slouching deprivation to
erect, enlightened rea- son. The other movement presents the reverse:
regression backwards from (white, male) adulthood to a primordial, black
\"degeneracy\" usually incarnated in women. The Passage rehearses this
temporal logic: progress through the ascending doors, from primitive
pre-history, bereft of lan- and enlightened hybridity. Leaving the
exhibit, history is traversed back- guage and light, through the epic
stages of colonialism, post-colonialism wards. As in colonial discourse,
the movement forward in space is back- wards in time: from erect, verbal
consciousness and hybrid freedom - signified by the (not very free)
white rabbit called \"Free\" which roams the exhibit - down through the
historic stages of decreasing stature to the shambling, tongueless zone
of the pre-colonial, from speech to silence, light to dark. The paradox
structuring the exhibit intrigues me, as it is a paradox, I suggest,
that shapes the term \"post-colonialism.\" I am doubly interested in the
term, since the almost ritualistic ubiquity of \"post-\" words in
current culture (]{.underline}post-colonialism, post-modernism,
post-structuralism, post-cold war, post-marxism, post-apartheid,
post-Soviet, post-Ford, post-feminism, post-national, post-historic,
even post-contemporary[) sig- nals, I believe, a widespread, epochal
crisis in the idea of linear, historical \"progress.\"]{.underline}

#### The nuclear deal with Iran was simply another way to draw Iran back into the folds of Western imperialism and colonial control

**Nuruzzaman 16** (Nuruzzaman, Mohammed. \"Post-Nuclear Deal Iran: Back

On 14 July 2015, Iran and the P5+1 states signed a historic nuclear
deal, dubbed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), to finally
end the thirteen-year nuclear standoff between Tehran and Washington.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani branded the JCPOA, \"the victory of the
people of Iran on the political arena.\"1 Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei
also viewed the deal as a significant step towards bolstering Iran\'s
rights, dignity and independence. [Under the terms and conditions of the
JCPOA, Iran has agreed to greatly scale back its nuclear program, though
not to abrogate its nuclear rights, in exchange for sanctions
relief]{.underline}. So, from the Iranian perspective, the deal fits the
basic rationale of the 1979 Islamic Revolution that saved Iran from
subjugation by the U.S. and restored its full independence in a
West-dominated international order. Critics, [however]{.underline},
contend that [Khamenei was under extreme pressure to get rid of the
financial sanctions that had been imposed on Iran]{.underline},
particularly during the tenure of former hardline President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad, [and]{.underline} that [the deal falls short of being a
victory for Iran.]{.underline} Two important interpretations arise out
of Iran\'s willingness to sign and implement the JCPOA: firstly, [the
U.S.-led sanctions regime was choking Iran economically so much that the
top leadership had to find a way out]{.underline}; and secondly, **[the
lifting of sanctions has facilitated Iran\'s reintegration into the
capitalist global economy]{.underline}**, **[which the late Ayatollah
Khomeini castigated as the West\'s imperialistic blueprint to exploit
and dominate oppressed people worldwide]{.underline}**, especially in
the Muslim world. Khomeini propagated the catchphrase \'neither East,
nor West, the Islamic Republic\' to initiate a new political course and
development model to reduce Iran\'s structural dependence on the
imperialist West. The reality was different, however. [Post-revolution
Ira]{.underline}n, like the now defunct socialist bloc led by the Soviet
Union, [had to operate within the parameters of the imperialistic
capitalist global economy]{.underline}. [**The current nuclear deal with
the P5+1 states may further increase Iran\'s structural dependence** on
the imperialist **West by accelerating Iranian reintegration into the
West-controlled global economy and thus compromising the economic,
ideological and philosophical foundations of Khomeini\'s Islamic
Republic**]{.underline}. Iran\'s re-[enmeshment with imperialist
capitalist relations]{.underline}, facilitated by the JCPOA, [pushes
Iran deep into imperialism]{.underline}, [although it also brings new
opportunities for the Iranians to bolster their economic position and
political assertiveness, and to enhance their strategic weight in the
Middle Ea]{.underline}st[.]{.underline} Said differently,
[Iran]{.underline}, [after nearly four decades of revolutionary
tempest]{.underline}, **[is slowly coming back to the fold of
imperialism]{.underline}** (or neo-imperialism in the modern context).
This commentary, in the pages below, pursues and develops this basic
contention.

### L - Progress 

#### Depictions of progress reinforces the subordination of indigenous peoples as the 'other' in order to deprive them of their agency and assert the settler states' authority over them by claiming moral obligation to save them

**Rollo, 16.** \[Toby Rollo, Ph.D. in political science from the
University of Toronto. Assistant professor of political science at
Lakehead University. 06-29-2016. "Feral children: settler colonialism,
progress, and the figure of the child" (Settler Colonial Studies), Vol.
8, No. 1, pp 60-79.\]//pacc

[[Settler colonialism is structured]{.underline}]{.mark} in part
[[according to]{.mark} the principle of civilizational
[progress]{.mark}]{.underline} yet the roots of this doctrine are not
well understood. [Disparate ideas of progress and practices related to
colonial dispossession and domination can be traced back to the
Enlightenment, and as far back as ancient Greece]{.underline}, but there
remain unexplored logics and continuities. I argue that civilizational
progress and settler colonialism are structured according to the
opposition between politics governed by reason or faith and the figure
of the child as sinful or bestial. Thus, it is not contingent, but
rather necessary that justificatory frameworks of European empire and
colonialism depict Indigenous peoples as children[.]{.underline} To
illustrate how the theoretical link between Indigenous peoples and
children emerges not as a simple analogy, but rather, as the source of
the premodern/modern and savage/civilized binaries, I trace the various
historical iterations of the political/childhood opposition through the
classical, medieval, enlightenment, and modern eras. I show how the
model of civilizational progress from a premodern and savage state of
childhood continues to serve as the model for settler colonial exclusion
and domination of Indigenous peoples. [The violence of settler colonial
dispossession and assimilation flows historically from civilizational
precepts such as Manifest Destiny, terra nullius, the white man's burden
and the Doctrine of Discovery.]{.underline} Although formally rejected
by modern governments, [these principles are]{.underline} nevertheless
[preserved in the legal and political systems of contemporary settler
colonial states.]{.underline} The figure at the heart of these colonial
doctrines is the 'Indian', often understood as an incarnation of the
ancient Greek and Roman category of the foreign barbarian whose conquest
was an enduring imperial ambition.1 Yet the conceptualization of the
'Indian' in the context of New World settler colonialism differs
significantly from this classification. Whereas the category of the
barbarian reflected an ancient imperial mandate to pursue glory through
conquest and slavery, [[the idea of the 'Indian' is distinguished by the
modern colonial mandates of civilizational progress through
dispossession]{.mark} and education]{.underline}. I argue in the
following that Indigenous peoples are not conceptualized primarily as
barbarian opponents of empire, but rather, the 'Indian' is constructed
according to the ancient conception of the degraded, not fully human,
child. In the following, I use the term misopedy to refer to the
denigration and subordination of children and childhood.2 [Misopedy is
an ancient form of social and political hierarchy.]{.underline} Despite
the fact that 'European xenophobic traditions such as anti-Semitism,
Islamophobia, or Negrophobia are considerably older than race',3
misopedy appears to be older still. [The idea of a telos of
progress]{.underline} from animal child to human adult [is both a
historical and conceptual antecedent of the idea of European
civilization, prefiguring its stories about maturation and progress from
cultural ignorance to enlightenment.]{.underline} While analyses of how
race and gender relate to coloniality provide valuable insights,4
[contemporary processes of settler colonial dispossession and
assimilation can only be fully understood through the lens of
misopedy.]{.underline} Just as the adult was conceptualized in
contradistinction to the child as [an ontological 'other', the 'Indian'
came to be situated as the other of the European]{.underline}.5 The
eighteenth-century historian, Frederich von Schiller, provides a classic
illustration of how Indigenous peoples were constructed as savage
'Indians' through their classification as children: The discoveries
which our [European seafarers]{.underline} have made in distant oceans
and on remote shores afford us a spectacle which is as instructive as it
is entertaining. They [show us societies arrayed around us at various
levels of development, as an adult might be surrounded by children of
different ages,]{.underline} reminded by their example of what he
himself once was and whence he started. A wise hand seems to have
preserved these savage tribes until such time as we have progressed
sufficiently in our own civilization to make useful application of this
discovery, and from this mirror to recover the lost beginning of our
race. But how embarrassing and dismal is the picture of our own
childhood presented in these peoples!6 In his nineteenth-century
commentary on Chief Pontiac, Francis Parkman (whom Roy Harvey Pearce
called 'the prime historian of the victory of civilization over
savagism') provides another instructive passage on the 'Indian'
constructed as child: Pontiac was a thorough savage, and in him stand
forth, in strongest light and shadow, the native faults and virtues of
the Indian race. All children, says Sir Walter Scott, are naturally
liars; and truth and honor are developments of later education.7 Even
here, in the late eighteenth century, the construction of the native is
not essentially a racial project. In the same way that Schiller depicted
native 'races' as peoples emerging from civilizational childhood,
Parkman is also clear that the virtues and vices of the native are found
in all feral children of civilization, including white European
ancestors, irrespective of race: [Barbarism is to civilization what
childhood is to maturity; and all savages, whatever may be their
country, their color, or their lineage, are prone to treachery and
deceit.]{.underline} The barbarous ancestors of our own frank and manly
race are no less obnoxious to the charge than those of the cat-like
Bengalee; for in this childhood of society brave men and cowards are
treacherous alike.8 [The colonial denial of full humanity usually takes
two forms.]{.underline} The first is totalizing and involves the
depiction of peoples as non-human animals, insects, or vermin.9 [We find
this discourse most ominously deployed in the context of physical
genocide.]{.underline} The second functions much differently for [it not
only justifies the use of coercion and violence but frames it as an
obligatory means of inducing maturity -- of motivating feral or
premodern peoples along the natural telos of humanity towards the
fulfilment of a normative ideal of progress. The result is a form of
cultural genocide]{.underline}. In the context of contemporary settler
colonialism, it is this second form of denial that demands greater
analysis. [[Re-imagining Indigenous peoples as 'Indians' was crucial in
legitimizing colonial claims to territorial
sovereignty.]{.underline}]{.mark}10 **[[The dual colonial mandates of
dispossession and pacification were advanced by modelling Indigenous
peoples]{.mark} -- legally and politically [-- according
to]{.mark}]{.underline}** the only existing class of people in
**[[Western thought for whom there existed a moral obligation to provide
assistance but for whom political claims were
impossible]{.underline}]{.mark}**: children[. Through this specific
classification, a number of colonial functions]{.underline} that could
not be accomplished by racial, ethnic, linguistic, or geographical
distinctions alone [were advanced.]{.underline} [[Colonial actors were
fundamentally concerned with disqualifying Indigenous peoples as
political agents]{.mark} with sufficient intelligence or reason to form
political communities with legitimate claims to nationhood, land, and
sovereignty.]{.underline} As Patrick Wolfe observes: 'Indigenous North
Americans were not killed, driven away, romanticized, assimilated,
fenced in, bred White, and otherwise eliminated as the original owners
of the land but as Indians.'11 Securing resource extraction, trade,
commerce, and governance -- European benchmarks of cultural progress --
proved nearly impossible without pacification of Indigenous territories,
a goal best served by the coerced education and assimilation of the
'Indian' in Christian faith and/or Enlightenment reason. **[[The
hierarchy and violence embodied in the forced removal and education was
justified according to the doctrine of civilizational
progress]{.mark}]{.underline}** out of childhood.12

Just as every act of violence has a history, so too [humanitarian
reactions against colonial violence must be understood as emerging
through a complex genealogy of political and ethical
though]{.underline}t, a trajectory which itself must be historicised.
Nonviolence, both as a term and as an activist approach and moral
philosophy of anticolonial and later civil rights action, most popularly
emerges in the early twentieth with Mohandas K. Gandhi's use of the
"ancient but powerful idea of ahimsa, or nonviolence, and made it
familiar throughout the world. Martin Luther King, Jr. followed in his
footsteps."48 A long history traces various forms of nonviolence,
especially in the West, the elaboration of which is outside the scope of
this introductory essay.49 Of pertinence here, however, is that during
the early nineteenth century, humanitarians and activists against
violence mobilised antecedent ideas, especially via potent and affective
Biblical tenets, not only of dishonour, shame and national sin and
redemption, but also of pacification, conciliation, amelioration and
protection.50 The positive connotations of many of these
terms---pacification, conciliation, amelioration and
protection---supported well-intentioned nineteenth-century actors, even
if subsequently humanitarian terminology has faced critique and
revision, especially in settler cultures. [The loaded language of
nonviolence serves to remind us of its provocative role in challenging
the ethics of imperial expansion,]{.underline} **[and also the ways in
which humanitarian efforts to combat the ill effects of colonialism upon
Indigenous people have themselves become contentious]{.underline}**.
Humanitarians on the frontier advocated nonviolent means in order to
stabilise precarious and highly dangerous social conditions, and
Elizabeth Elbourne's paper in this collection raises the "impossibility"
of nonviolence in confrontational colonial zones, where Indigenous men,
especially, were inevitably drawn into messy violent relations involving
multiple foes and allies. In such ways, [the utopian ideals of activists
could themselves be seen as forms of intervention **that effectively
sought to "pacify" Indigenous people in ways that rendered them more
easily subjected to governance and more vulnerable to both physical and
cultural damage.** "Protection]{.underline}," key to the
nineteenth-century humanitarian vocabulary[, has diverse meanings that
change over time]{.underline}. **[This is particularly so in settler
colonies, where the rhetoric of protection was increasingly harnessed to
the demands of the settler state]{.underline}**, [and was frequently
used to remove, incarcerate, and delimit the rights of Indigenous
peoples]{.underline}. Ironically, [for Indigenous people seeking
self-governanc]{.underline}e, [the language of rights often defaulted on
to protection]{.underline}. Strategies of protection could too easily
turn to regulation, surveillance and the spatial incarceration of
Aboriginal peoples. Indeed, scholars have more recently illuminated the
ways in which strategies for a benevolent empire were ultimately tied to
securing the colonial order and the central goal of colonial state
building. As Amanda Nettelbeck's essay in this volume shows, [the
rhetoric of protection and civilisation]{.underline}, along with ideas
of reparation, [offered Australian settler colonialism a benign
face]{.underline}.51 Despite this, Aboriginal people enlisted the
humanitarian agendas and rhetoric of protection in encounters with
representatives of the British Crown to further their own goals and to
make claims on the state. Protection also played out distinctively in
India. Vinita Damodaran traces a protectionist discourse that emerged
between 1830 and 1930 in relation to tribal peoples and areas:
comparisons between tribal, Dalit, and Indigenous groups in settler
cultures has proved compelling for a range of postcolonial scholars.
Damodaran's analysis of the mountainous region of Orissa---a rural,
heavily forested area populated mostly by Indigenous (adivasi)
people---reveals how Raj officials intervened to reinstate customary
law. Ironically, the ["noble savage" discourse of the eighteenth century
allowed a humanitarian discourse to emerge about the position of tribes
and their custom in the mid-nineteenth century]{.underline}.52
[Traditional land tenure systems]{.underline}, which accounted for both
sedentary and shifting cultivation, [had been eroded by the moneylending
landlords]{.underline} (zamindars and mahajans). Early [British
involvement in India colluded in the displacement and marginalisation of
tribal communities,]{.underline} [yet fierce and irreconcilable
hostility to Raj models of governance forced a recognition of tribal
rights and the limits of colonial]{.underline} [power]{.underline}.
Administrators, missionaries, and ethnologists used the language of
humanitarianism to argue, successfully, for the importance of forest
rights (for ritual and other practices) after early 1850s rebellions:
"Often misjudged, but sometimes appropriate, the efforts to protect
these customary rights helped to institutionalize the fact of tribal
autonomy."53 Damodaran argues that more sophisticated readings of
colonial ethnography are necessary in order to trace both the complex
strands of imperial thought and the variety of agents involved in
colonial projects.

### L -- Security

#### Their logic of risk management and mitigation serve to justify interventionism to secure the Settler state.

The [military science from which the business model of logistics emerged
gave rise to a twin field of civil defense]{.underline} during the
period between world wars. The objective of [civil defense programs was
to identify and secure domestic infrastructures deemed essential or
"vital" to the life of population and to the industrial capacities of
nation-states]{.underline}; this "vital" status made these
infrastructures strategic targets for attack (Collier and Lakoff, 2008;
Neocleous, 2014). Gradually, [the scope of civil defense expanded beyond
wartime defense to a broader program of emergency preparedness in
relation to natural or industrial disasters]{.underline} affecting a
wider range of infrastructures. Meanwhile, the [organization of national
security around the threat of external geopolitical "enemies" was
increasingly seen as anachronistic]{.underline}. In the mid-1970s,
[security experts turned their attention to the vulnerabilities of vital
infrastructure systems because of their increased interconnectedness and
embeddedness]{.underline} in society. **[Disruption of these systems
could have potentially catastrophic effects for the population and
economic well-being]{.underline}**. Whether intentionally caused by
non-state actors (i.e. terrorists or "subversives"), technology
failures, or forces of nature, the problem is to reduce system
vulnerabilities (Collier and Lakoff, 2008). While the systems
vulnerability model took root in techno-scientific knowledge production,
it did not enter political discourse in the US and Canada until the
mid-1990s as a dominant paradigm for national security. Significantly,
[this all-hazards emergency management approach adopts principles and
practices from the supply chain security field of business
logistics]{.underline} (Collier and Lakoff, 2008). The all-hazards
framework shares two core underlying assumptions with supply chain
security. The first is that [intentional and unintentional
disruptions---and potential emergencies---stemming from natural and
human-induced causes are an inevitable reality of the complexities of
contemporary society, including trade]{.underline}. The second
assumption is that [all types of threats can be managed through four
pillars of risk management: mitigation, preparedness, response, and
recovery]{.underline}. **[Mitigation is the most important pillar, which
relies on identifying potential risks and acting to prevent or minimize
disruption to avoid emergencies]{.underline}**. This model of [risk
management **attempts to address the incalculable uncertainty of
"unforeseeable events" through pre-emptive planning**]{.underline}
(Petit et al., 2010: 5). A key strategy of mitigating supply chain
vulnerabilities is to enhance system resilience---[the capacity to adapt
to or "bounce back" from disruption to ensure continuing]{.underline}
circulation or [functionality]{.underline} (Petit et al., 2010). [Rather
than responding to concrete imminent threats, this is a broader
pre-emptive strategy that anticipates unknown future threats by
designing them out]{.underline}. Through this logic, [resilience
requires not just maintaining or defending existing infrastructures and
capacities, but augmenting, enhancing, and creating them.]{.underline}
[Future uncertainties become present opportunities]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} all-hazards emergency [management]{.underline}
[approach is a future-oriented paradigm that deploys **the conceptual
elasticity of emergency** in ways that **expand the bounds of
pre-emptive interventions in the name of security**]{.underline}. The
specific conditions and thresholds that constitute an emergency can only
be delimited when a situation is occurring and its effects being
experienced (Hussain, 2003). This is detrimental in the context of
logistics, as responding to a disruption only after it is occurring
compounds potential damages to interdependent supply chains. In the
context of state governance, [the "emergency imaginary]{.underline}"
(Calhoun, 2004)---[the pervasive, always-in-the-future potential of
emergency---rationalizes interventions undertaken in the interests of
the health, safety, and "well-being" of people, property, the economy
and government.]{.underline} As Neocleous (2008) argues, "[emergency"
masks the political effects of such practices]{.underline}. Indeed,
**[this is particularly the case in colonial contexts, as Indigenous
peoples' self-determination poses a perpetual emergency for the
settler-colonial state's claim to absolute sovereignty]{.underline}**
(see Dafnos et al., 2016).

### L - State

#### The state is horrendous- it deems individuals who are "worthy" and those who are not, insinuating a self fulfilling prophecy rooted in Euro-American colonialism.

**Abolitionjournal**, 4-22-20**18,** \"Burn it Down: Abolition,
Insurgent Political Praxis, and the Destruction of Decency,\" Abolition,
<https://abolitionjournal.org/burn-it-down/>/SR

Introduction: The Contemporary State and the "Decent Fellow" This
journal calls for abolition, a call implicitly asserting that
contemporary sociopolitical and economic institutions are inherently
unfixable and beyond resuscitation, reform, or rescue. The fantasy of
radically changing political structures from within is simply not a
viable political option for those concerned with the ultimate
destruction of the mechanisms of carnage that shape modern life and its
attendant regimes of governance, such as: the global war machine, the
prison industrial complex, transnational resource extraction, and the
national sacrifice areas (Ortiz 1992) generated in the wake of these
lethal socioeconomic configurations and expressions of
empire.[\[i\]](https://abolitionjournal.org/burn-it-down/#_edn1)Rather
than drawing from these regimes of death for social and legal
recognition, power, and welfare---what we broadly refer to as the
"state"---consider what it would mean to the modern ordering of life to
utterly destroy the state, to refuse its seductions and ruses of power,
to incinerate it until nothing remains but ash? Our imperative to "burn
it down" draws from a rich tradition of scholarship that positions the
state as a technique, practice, and effect of modern governance and its
optimization, rationalization, and normalization. Following Timothy
Mitchell, we define the state as a "network of institutional mechanisms
through which a certain social and political order is maintained"
(Mitchell 2006, 175). In the words of Michel Foucault, the state
functions as "a schema of intelligibility for a whole set of already
established institutions, a whole set of given realities" (Foucault
2004, 286). As a schematic and reality, we perceive the state as
providing a legible matrix for the parameters of self-management and
self-conduct: for social and political order. As Achille [Mbembe
insists, the adoption of **state** or sovereign **power is "a twofold
process of self-institution and self-limitation**]{.underline}**"**
(Mbembe 2003, 13). Attendant to the important critiques made by Fanon,
we argue that this twofold process remains shaped by Euro-American
colonial mores at the "objective as well as subjective level" of
experience and perception (Fanon 2008, xv). That is to say, [**we
understand state power as generative of inherently colonial relations of
rule:** relations that **produce contemporary sociopolitical, juridical,
and affective orientations, sensibilities, and
subjectivities**]{.underline}.[\[ii\]](https://abolitionjournal.org/burn-it-down/#_edn2)
As Glen Sean Coulthard argues, ["colonial relations of power
are]{.underline} no longer [reproduced]{.underline} primarily through
overtly coercive means, but rather [through the asymmetrical exchange of
mediated forms of state recognition and accommodation]{.underline}"
(Coulthard 2014, 15). We add that the state accomplishes this mediation
vis-à-vis the internalized politics of decency: an argument to which we
shortly return. The project of this piece is not to think about how to
make life more livable under current regimes of power or to ponder
building something new or altered in the state's place. Rather, we
imagine alternative worlds based in the total abolition of these regimes
because of their astonishingly responsive capabilities, which render
profound social transformation impossible. [The state successfully
incorporates its margins and continually extends its representation in
order to further its grasp on the body politic]{.underline} (for
instance, the inclusion of women in combat roles or the Supreme Court
ruling on same sex marriage). Simultaneously, and without coincidence,
the state manipulates its boundaries through violent forms of capital
accumulation and proxy wars, marks borders with fences and deportations,
and uses its streets as a costly theater for subjects that deviate from
its aims. However, the fundamentally lethal interests of state power
have not changed since the European invasion of the Americas. [Instead,
global technologies of communication and visibility have forced the
state to pivot, creating the illusion of a more transparent, democratic,
and equal society.]{.underline} Nonetheless[, the state relies on
fantasies of "individual" participation]{.underline} (civil rights,
voting, recognition, and protest) [as much as it relies on its
authoritarian power to revoke those fantasies without notice or
recourse]{.underline}. As the violences executed by the state continue
to shape everyday life in this country, we believe that it is by no
means extreme to posit that one solution to these ills is to
destroy---to burn down---contemporary institutions of governance,
policing, and comfort, to cooperatively dismantle the workings of the
state. For us, a radical project of abolition and insurgent political
praxis refuses to negotiate with the state, or seek recognition from any
of its bureaucratic apparatuses, in order to secure the small-scale
concessions that only colonize and quell resistance. [Political projects
of compromise with the state have proven insufficient---especially in
addressing everyday violence, such as police brutality, that continues
to erupt unchecked in the face of mainstream "social justice"
organizing. Ultimately, this organizing and activism treats the state as
a central means of stopping the very political violence that insures its
core function, operation, and maintenance. **State tactics shift, but
are nonetheless** continually productive of social protocols for
acceptable, legible citizens and aberrant, disposable subjects: a
division and "existential deviation" (Fanon 2008, xvii) that we argue is
**rooted in Euro-American colonial power**, such as white supremacy and
heteropatriarchy.]{.underline} This power, which continues to inform the
tangible parameters of the modern state, must remain the strategic
target of abolition as a practice and vision if new worlds or
alternative spaces of sociopolitical organization are to exist and
thrive. As we show, one of the central challenges that insurgents face
is the fact that colonial state power remains occluded by the
representational moorings of the Euro-American civilizing mission, such
as the political conceptions of civility and decency that remain the
ideological cornerstones of democratic
participation.[\[iii\]](https://abolitionjournal.org/burn-it-down/#_edn3)These
notions legitimize certain forms of organizing and comportment over
others, ensuring that state power is distributed, unchanged, into the
hands of those that best serve its interests. We dedicate the remainder
of this article to examining how these concepts further colonial state
power in order to ground our call for the incineration of decency as a
starting point for insurgent political praxis. The terms "decency" and
"civility" are used interchangeably in this article to describe a
particular form of exclusionary, homicidal, and suicidal politics[. This
politics demands inclusion within the colonial state, as it currently
exists---at the expense of dismantling white supremacy,
heteropatriarchy, transphobia, and capitalism on a global level, in the
name of respectability, conviviality, progress and
democracy.]{.underline} Following Aimé Césaire, we argue that the
politics of decency represents the true "barbarism" of the colonizer
(Césaire 2000, 47). Césaire stated that: I make no secret of my opinion
that at the present time the barbarism of Western Europe has reached an
incredibly high level, being surpassed---far surpassed, it is true---by
the barbarism of the United States. And I am not talking about Hitler,
or the prison guard, or the adventurer, but about the "decent fellow"
across the way...the respectable bourgeois \[emphasis added\] (Césaire
2000, 47). For Césaire, [the problem of colonial domination did not lie
solely within its more overt acts of death dealing, expressed
"openly...in broad daylight" (Césaire 2000, 49). Rather, Césaire held
that the problem of this domination also resided in its ideological
shadows: its "decent" homes, families, schools and churches, its
"respectable" citizen-subjects who turned a blind eye to the genocide
shaping everyday life in colonized locations (e.g., the U.S.) and long
before World War II. In fact, Césaire insisted that the politics of
decency was central to legitimizing the genocide of the original
civilizing mission: the violent implementation of Euro-American systems
of thought, embodied taxonomies, historicity, and political governance
to consolidate socioeconomic and biological power.]{.underline} As
Césaire poignantly argued: "I hear the storm. [They talk to me about
progress, about achievements, diseases cured, improved standards of
living. I am talking about societies drained of their essence, cultures
trampled underfoot...extraordinary possibilities wiped out"]{.underline}
(Césaire 2000, 42). [Thus, at the heart of the civilizing mission, the
conceptual fuel that drove its murderous engine was the framing of its
white supremacist, capitalist, and heteropatriarchal violences as the
epitome of Euro-American decency and civility. We argue that the
continued advancement and adoption of decency as a cultural commandment
of behavior for participation in the civic sphere enacts the civilizing
mission in its recalibrated form and lethally fortifies colonial
statecraft and power. For example, these politics legitimize (what
appears to be) the passive participation of the "decent fellow" and the
"respectable bourgeois" in this mission vis-à-vis so-called "peaceful"
desires for inclusion within the state. The danger of this passivity and
desire is that both are absolutely violent and perpetuate an outside,
"indecent" constituency. This "indecent" constituency is figured as the
biopolitical break in the population that threatens to overrun state
interests; wherein Muslims are imagined as terrorist, blackness is
always already criminal, and]{.underline} **[whiteness remains the
standard by which diversity is measured and
extracted]{.underline}**.[\[iv\]](https://abolitionjournal.org/burn-it-down/#_edn4)
When everyday violence is deployed in the name of these ideologies**[,
the state arbitrates between those who are innocent and
guilty,]{.underline}** **[offering a judgement that continues to be
divided by race, class, gender, and sexuality.]{.underline}** This
violence is perceived as the "natural" expression of "civilization," key
to its maintenance and safety. When those who decry these judgements
deploy violence, they do so outside of the Euro-American parameters of
the "decent," and are thus marked for rationalized, legitimized,
"civilized" annihilation. As the state is intent on maintaining
interpretive and legal control over violence via decency, we see a
counter politics of "indecency" as entirely necessary to dismantle its
power. Our call to burn it down is thus a promotion of indecency as an
acceptable practice in order to refuse colonial state structures at
emotional, cultural, and psychic levels. We violently reject the
politics of decency as an ideology, practice, and psychic orientation.
The next section begins to advance the rationales of our position by
outlining the role of decency in channeling political responses to
environmental genocide in the U.S. Southwest. We draw from the "EPA
Spill," which occurred during the summer of 2015 and devastated occupied
Indigenous lands in the Four Corners region, to center this discussion.
In the following section, we outline the mechanisms of embodiment that
fortify colonial state power vis-à-vis decency and as articulated by the
2016 presidential election. In the final section, we explore how
"decent" state concessions and accommodations further all of these
processes, by contextualizing the "Central American Immigration Crisis":
the U.S. detainment of children primarily from Guatemala, El Salvador,
and Honduras, in the name of humanitarian "law and order." To answer
Abolition's call "to make the impossible possible," we conclude by
addressing some of the challenges of our "indecent" politics and
position. Decency, Colonial Recognition, and Environmental Genocide in
the U.S. Southwest An important step towards formulating a viable
politics of indecency is to rebuke what Frantz Fanon called "colonial
recognition": the desire to acquire, adopt, or wield colonial power in
its currently known, felt, embodied, and codified registers (Fanon 2008,
192-193). Following Fanon's call in The Wretched of the Earth, we
contend that this desire must be violently negated in order to stop the
dangerous reproduction of colonial power as a feature of life,
statecraft, and capital
accumulation.[\[v\]](https://abolitionjournal.org/burn-it-down/#_edn5)
We argue that the politics of decency is the ideological hinge upon
which colonial recognition rests, in terms of speciously passive
"desires" to be enfolded within the established legal, political,
affective, and embodied boundaries of the state. To advance this
argument, as well as a political praxis of indecency, we trace some of
the lethal ramifications of colonial recognition and environmental
genocide in the U.S. Southwest. To understand the phenomenal staying
power of colonial recognition, we turn to the work of self-identified
"working-class peasant with Indigenous ancestry" and Guatemalan scholar,
Egla Martínez Salazar, and what she calls "the global coloniality of
power" (Martínez Salazar 2014,
9).[\[vi\]](https://abolitionjournal.org/burn-it-down/#_edn6) Martínez
Salazar insists that the replication of contemporary power depends upon
the fleshed, symbolic, and cognitive categories of governance
implemented by European settler-colonial regimes in the Americas.
Despite the technical "independence" of the Americas from countries such
as Britain, Spain, France, or Portugal, Martínez Salazar argues that the
fundamental norms of colonial power, such as heteropatriarchy,
capitalism, and white supremacy, were never dismantled or destroyed.
Instead, what Martínez Salazar calls the "colonizer's heirs"--- what
Césaire termed the decent fellow and the respectable
bourgeois---desired, sought, acquired, and consolidated this power in
its Eurocentric form; in order to govern and control so-called
"post-colonial" social fields, modes of capital accumulation, and
political life (Martínez Salazar 2014,
47).[\[vii\]](https://abolitionjournal.org/burn-it-down/#_edn7) Martínez
Salazar thus uses the term "coloniality" to highlight how colonialism is
not a "post or past phenomenon" but functions as a "reworked power
relation" that legitimizes "economic, racial, and gender gaps" between
and within nations: nations that remain organized, in a hegemonic sense,
around Euro-American geocultural norms, or what she terms "the global
coloniality of power" (Martínez Salazar 2014,
7).[\[viii\]](https://abolitionjournal.org/burn-it-down/#_edn8) We add
that the global coloniality of power shapes the politics of decency as
an insurgent political concern and priority. For example, contemporary
"development" initiatives depend upon the racialized, gendered, and
classed schemas undergirding historical forms of colonial
classification, capital accumulation, and relations of rule. These
schemas continue to demarcate "civilized" and "modern" lands and peoples
from "backwards" and "savage" lands and peoples: a conceptual move that
cloaks the destruction of Euro-American notions of progress and profit,
the "storm" of colonial oppression, by rendering this destruction a
benevolent act of grace, decency, civility. In fact, these schemas,
generated by the global coloniality of power, give the politics of
decency its interpretive resonance precisely because the organizing
logics and justifications of the civilizing mission are ongoing
problems. The above argument can be illustrated by historically
contextualizing what has been dubbed the "EPA Spill" and the forces of
colonial recognition that impacted how some stakeholders responded to
the environmental genocide left in its wake. The "EPA Spill"
(re)polluted two of the major rivers sustaining the Four Corners region
(Northwestern New Mexico, Northeastern Arizona, Southwestern Colorado,
and Southeastern Utah), the Animas and San Juan. In August of 2015,
government agents from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
"accidentally released" three million gallons of toxic waste containing
poisonous metals into the Animas and San Juan, while "cleaning up" the
Gold King Mine in Silverton, Colorado. As a result, these rivers ran a
sickly, neon yellow and orange (Thompson 2015). The Four Corners is
colloquially known around the world as "Indian Country" because this
region is where many diverse and sovereign Indigenous nations live, such
as various Diné/Navajo, Ndeh/Apache, Ute, Hopitu/Hopi, and Zuni groups
and peoples. Despite its status as a global cultural heritage and
tourism attraction, life in the Four Corners is shaped by staggering
poverty and environmental devastation. For example, Gold King Mine had
been "releasing" waste into the San Juan and Animas Rivers since the
late 1800s. A coalition of residents in Silverton actually barred the
EPA from previous clean-up efforts because "locals feared that the
stigma would destroy tourism along with any possibility of mining's
return" (Thompson 2015). As tourism and resource extraction are two of
the only viable capitalist sectors in the Four Corners, they are
protected at mortal expense and in the name of economic development.
Still, as resource extraction makes more money, it dominates the
economy. For example, the land surrounding the Four Corners' most
profitable tourism jewel, the world-renowned archaeological site of
Chaco Canyon, is currently being fracked. Indeed, "beneath a giant
methane gas cloud recently identified by NASA" from space, the fracking
industry continues to grow in this part of the Four Corners---to the
horror of many of the Indigenous people, people of color, and
working-class whites who live under this cloud (Dermansky 2015). Thus,
as most people from this area are painfully aware, it is only because
the waters of the Animas and San Juan turned a visible and septic
yellow/orange that this most recent act of environmental and cultural
desecration in the Four Corners garnered widespread attention. As
starkly noted by Simon Ortiz, the Four Corners bears the heavy burden of
being a "national sacrifice area," a zone of colonial impunity and
violent capital accumulation, in both a contemporary and historical
sense (Ortiz 1992, 361). Ortiz---a poet, former uranium miner, and
member of the Aacqu/Acoma Pueblo in Northern New Mexico---insists that
the systems of governance implemented by the Spanish Crown in the
sixteenth century, and by what he calls the "American Occupation" of the
Southwest in the late nineteenth century, share uncanny similarities
that support his contention (Ortiz 1992, 31). For example, Ortiz points
out that both regimes framed Indigenous lands and peoples of the
Southwest as "savage" or in need of the "civilizing" touch of
Euro-American ways of knowing, worshipping, and ordering the world. This
juxtaposition ensured that there "was no need for conspiracy to steal
and defraud; rather there was a national goal to fulfill and godly
purpose to be done" (Ortiz 1992, 349). By drawing from these imperial
logics to transmute the Southwest into a national sacrifice area,
Euro-American power has long been consolidated in the Four Corners, in
the "godly" name of decency or the civilizing mission. The Four Corners
is thus one consequence and manifestation of the politics of decency:
politics rendered intelligible due to what Martínez Salazar insists is
the global coloniality of power. Consequently, the populations hardest
hit by the EPA Spill were already negotiating the daily crises of
coloniality in the Four Corners, the fact that in national sacrifice
areas, "it is survival that is at stake" (Ortiz 1992, 360). Poor and
working-class Diné, Hopi, Latinx, Ute and Anglo peoples living alongside
the San Juan and Animas---upon reservation lands and in
reservation-border towns like Farmington, NM--- fully rely on these
rivers for livestock care, irrigation, agriculture, life. These peoples,
already facing dire poverty, were made to exist without the water that
sustained their bodies and put food on the table by the U.S. government
(i.e., the colonial state). Hard on the heels of the EPA Spill, some
Diné farmers committed suicide (Woodruff 2016). In addition, towns such
as Waterflow, NM have long paid the price of the oil and coal extraction
driving the production of national energy. The sky in Waterflow is
always a toxic, yellow color and the smell of burning coal in the air
chokes the eyes and throat. People from the Four Corners also suffer
from various forms of cancer and other health problems because they live
in a national sacrifice area (see Figure 1). This terrifying reality is
the dynamic materiality of the global coloniality of power; the
continued purchase of Euro-American notions of progress and profit over
contemporary life; the "decency" of the reinvigorated civilizing
mission, administered vis-à-vis national sacrifice areas such as the
Four Corners.

[Life in the colony is endlessly complex and sometimes surprisingly
gentle. Literally, 'gentling' is a subtle coercion -- taming, making
docile, and domesticating. Not put together only by the violence of
dispossession, settler colonial societies incorporate these gentle
technologies to assert a 'home' on Native lands.]{.underline} Largely as
a legacy of its plantation history, Hawai'i is 'home' to many Asian
settlers. This essay considers the colonial complicity of Asian settler
homemaking in the context of local fisher protests against Hawai'i State
prohibition of overnight fishing at Ka'ena Point, a wildlife sanctuary
park on the northwest tip of O'ahu, Hawai'i.
Isaki,!'HB!645,!Settler!Sexuality,!Asian!Domesticity'. 83 For Asian
settlers, home-making in Hawai'i has been crosshatched with projects of
US citizenly-becoming, upward class mobility, struggles for, and
attempts to articulate, cultural community belonging. [These histories
situate Asian settlers on a tangent with white settler colonialism and
Hawaiian decolonisation struggles]{.underline}.1 This essay concerns one
tangent, in which the State is anxious to protect endangered species and
tourists from invading tent-cities of houseless people that might
attempt to pass as 'campers'. Local fishers counter that they have
rights to exercise traditional, cultural practices (whether or not they,
or their traditions, are Hawaiian) and to pass them onto their families,
that state administrators do not know the land they purport to care for,
and that fishers are easily distinguished from the 'homeless'. I
approach this impasse in three ways. [First, I question whether and how
settler and Hawaiian relationships to land, specifically relations of
ecological stewardship and home-making, can align towards
decolonisation. Second, and closely related to the first, is a concern
with local Asian settlers' sentimental aggression, of a 'loving the
land' that can come to contest indigenous claims to territory, cultural
practice, and natural resource rights. Third, the essay circles back to
the complicity between modern sexualities and settler home-making by
considering the gendered and sexualised terms of 'home', and whose homes
are recognised as such]{.underline}.

On December 2, 2016, US president-elect Donald Trump tweeted that he
received a call of congratulations from the president of Taiwan, Tsai
Ing-wen, and when questioned, defended himself with these wry
complaints: "Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars
of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call" and
"Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard
for our companies to compete), heavily tax our projects going into ..."1
Whether the call was a calculated stunt or a diplomatic gaffe, [Trump's
tweets unwittingly reveal **Taiwan** to be "an American
frontier,"]{.underline} to borrow the words of the long-forgotten George
Kerr, US diplomat and military adviser posted there in the 1940s, who
proposed to restructure Taiwan under US guidance, in effect creating an
"accidental state" on the island.2 [Wedged between the United States and
China, since the Cold War days this Pacific island-nation **has been
positioned as a bargaining chip** in the great power
politics]{.underline}: released from Japanese colonial rule in 1945, it
has since been un/willingly framed as a keystone in the western Pacific
anticommunist front, acting as the opposite of the "subhuman, inhuman,
and humanly unthinkable **[China]{.underline}**" that [allegedly
**threatens American** happiness and **greatness**]{.underline}.3 [As a
US--China frontier and a military borderland emerging out of Han-Chinese
settler colonialism, Japan's colonial scheme for advancing to Southeast
Asia, and US Pacific imperial cartography,]{.underline}4 [Taiwan's
modern formations are deeply embedded in these transpacific
entanglements, yet its significance has been disavowed and
absented]{.underline}---indeed, **[it serves a space of
exception]{.underline}** that, as US media are quick to acknowledge, is
"perhaps the most militarily vulnerable US partner anywhere in the
world" despite being a top market for US arms sales in Asia.5 Our reason
for invoking Taiwan here is manifold. As a central "problem" in
US--China relations, [Taiwan represents]{.underline} not just a
political concern but, more important for American studies scholars, [a
methodological and conceptual inspiration for grappling with the
complexities of "China" in the US global imagination.]{.underline}6 On
the one hand, [the reign of Trumpolitics has rendered
Taiwan]{.underline} \[End Page 443\] more visible, both domestically and
internationally, [as a space of exception **structurally linked to
Guantánamo, Abu Ghraib, and Okinawa that are subjected to** the regime
of **extraterritoriality**, which is the **norm**]{.underline}---not
exception---[to postwar American empire]{.underline}.7 While Taiwan is
neither an incarceral space nor a host of a US military base now, its
reliance on US protection and increasing economic integration with China
has locked itself in a state of "in/dependence," a conundrum that
pessimists have predicted would be resolved only by war.8 On the other
hand, [the way Taiwan has been fronted by Trump as a bargaining chip
reveals how large China looms in the US global imaginary now and **how
central maintaining and managing the Pacific and other frontiers still
is to the project of US imperialism.**]{.underline} On a more personal
level, as two Americanists with roots in Taiwan, we hope to better
comprehend these entangled, conflicting spaces and politics, with Japan,
Korea, the Pacific islands, and Southeast Asia deeply implicated in
complex transpacific dynamism. Against the tired tropes of orientalism
and Cold War divisions, we hope to initiate dialogue between the rich
field of transpacific studies and inter-Asia critique as we strive to
imagine more capacious and self-critical approaches to the "global" in
American studies. Today, [US--China relations are increasingly
characterized by competition, collusion, complicity, and even
collaboration on the global scale]{.underline} rather than simply
domination and resistance on the Pacific front. Through rearticulating
frontier spaces as critical borderlands in their disparate forms and
modalities in this new context, we seek to highlight critical visions
and practices that reorient America's global imaginary about China as a
relational comparativist project toward decolonization and
de-imperialization.

#### Taiwan as a political country is founded off of the settler-colonialist practices of KMT.

At the conclusion of World War II and the Chinese Civil War
(1945--1949), [a defeated KMT regime replaced the defeated Japanese
empire in Taiwan. Triangular relations remained, even if Indigenous
autonomy was now foreclosed rather than managed. **Forced assimilation
became even more forceful**.]{.underline} This time, too, the new regime
criticized the previous one in order to legitimize its rule.77
"Mainlander rule" was in many ways a type of settler rule, even if this
new settler-colonial formation was radically different from previous
ones and operated in a profoundly changed geopolitical context.78 [A new
wave of settlers (between one and two million in the late 1940s) quickly
asserted their political dominance over the descendants of previous
settlers and Aborigines alike. These mainlanders often literally
replaced departing Japanese occupiers and were accommodated in vacated
Japanese residential areas.79 This distinction between "old" settlers
and "new" settlers was officially denied throughout the Cold War, as was
the indigeneity of Aborigines. Like minorities in China, the latter were
declared to be Chinese]{.underline}. Th[e KMT's determination to impose
a unified Han Chinese identity on every individual on the island
resulted in the 1947 "February 28 Incident"]{.underline} (er er ba).
This anti-KMT uprising was **[brutally suppressed]{.underline}**. Both
Indigenous peoples and Han "Taiwanese" (old settlers) suffered in the
[post-2/28 White Terror roundups]{.underline}. The ensuing martial law
period would last nearly four decades. Perhaps because Han
[Ta]{.underline}iwanese and Aborigines alike had been victims of
political violence in the post-war years, centuries of their conflict,
especially the former's exploitation and expropriation of the latter,
disappeared from view. The [settler-colonial triangular system of
relationship continued to define the new era even if the distinction
between Han Taiwanese and Aborigines became blurred and Indigenous
autonomy was foreclosed]{.underline}. Tomonori Sugimoto's reading of
settler colonialism in post-WWII Taiwan identifies two successive
moments.80 During a first phase, government policy focused on equally
repressing old settlers and Indigenous peoples. This was followed by a
more tolerant period. Sugimoto argues that both policies were settler
colonial in that old settlers pursued political and cultural
self-indigenization and supplanting Indigenous peoples. The KMT's
control over all political expression only ended up encouraging
indigenizing tendencies among the old settlers. For example, the "Native
Soil Literature Movement" (xiangtu wenxue yundong) of the 1970s can be
interpreted in this context as advocating one way of
settler-indigenizing, proclaiming the need for "nativization" by
redefining a meaningful relationship between the past and the present
through artistic representations that moved beyond the dominant
anti-communist literature of the 1950s and 1960s.81 After the end of
martial law in 1987, politics on the island was transformed as the
violent repression of settler nationalism gave way to a political
dialectic between the "indigenising" Democratic Progressive Party (DPP,
Mínzhŭ Jìnbù Dang) and the "sinicizing" Nationalist Party (KMT,
Guomindang). But se[ttler colonialism has remained, as Indigenous voices
and visions of history continue to be marginalized or negated. The DPP
seeks to appropriate the history of Taiwan's Indigenous peoples to
assert the political independence of the island, while the KMT denies
this history and insists on China's timeless sovereignty over
Taiwan.]{.underline} Both positions demonstrate how [the construction of
a collective "self," demands the wilful forgetting of the past. In this
sense, **Taiwan's current political divisions are a result of the
forgetfulness of the past, namely, the settler-colonial
unconscious.**]{.underline} But the KMT regime also has represented
Taiwan as a "new" and yet simultaneously an "old" and more authentic
China, and consistently has justified its rule as necessary for the
protection of traditional Chinese culture.82 In the years immediately
after the Chinese Civil War, the party sought to build a more genuine
China than both the original neoChina it found in Taiwan and the
"perverted" China it left behind on the mainland[. Post-WWII Taiwan was
not about a "new" or a "better" country, but about reproducing a more
authentic country. "Here" and "there" were not premised on a "new" and
"old" dialectic, but on the opposition between "authentic" and
"non-authentic." Yet as the identity between "old" and "new" country has
already been proclaimed, the process of becoming the new country had to
be foreclosed. From the KMT perspective, this new country was already
the old one.]{.underline}

Taiwan exists in the between. In historical terms, [Taiwan has existed,
and continues to exist, in and between various iterations of colonial
occupation:]{.underline} from seventeenth-century Dutch rule and the
resulting Han settler colonialism to twentieth-century Japanese
occupation and the current colonial occupation of the lingering
Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalist government. [Politically, Taiwan resides in
between the competing imperialist discourses of the People's Republic of
China, which has long articulated a goal of "retaking" or "reunifying"
the island it claims as a renegade province, and the United States, a
nation that has demonstrated an ambivalent stance toward Taiwan and
expressions of its independence. As such, it has been appropriated as a
space on which to bargain the terms of US--China foreign policy---and
negotiate away the island's right to self-determination---since the
1970s.]{.underline} Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to the People's Republic
of China (PRC) culminated in the Shanghai Communiqué, which expressed
what would become the United States' guiding foreign policy principle of
One China, with Taiwan subsumed as part of China. Taiwan was thus used
as a negotiating tool to solidify a new partnership between the United
States and the PRC. The [United States expressed its acknowledgment for
the idea "that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain
there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China," and
declared, "The United States Government does not challenge that
position."]{.underline} By 1979 the United States had pulled military
personnel out of Taiwan and severed governmental recognition of the
Republic of China. In the space that is in and between occupation, and
[in between US--China foreign policy, Taiwan has been constituted by
colonial and imperial imaginations of its utility and
futurity.]{.underline} The following collective statement represents an
intention to articulate and organize a new possibility for Taiwan and
its independence. It was crafted as a response to the controversial
December 2, 2016, phone call between Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-Wen,
and Donald Trump, which presented a new dynamic of 466 \| American
Quarterly in-betweenness, one that catapulted the question of Taiwan
independence from the margins to center stage. Much of the reaction to
the call revolved around two general sentiments of panic and potential.
US foreign policy experts were anxious to preserve the One China status
quo, while many in Taiwan and the Taiwanese diaspora of the United
States were cautiously hopeful that it signaled the possibility for
renewed American support, especially in regard to independence. Taiwan
independence, it is often understood, cannot be practically achieved
without the backing of American militarized security. In this statement,
a growing contingent of Taiwanese and Taiwanese American scholars,
activists, artists, and people in solidarity argue for a reimagination
of the possibilities of the in-between to move beyond tactics of dollar
diplomacy and hopeful anticipation of American approval, toward more
sustainable projects of global solidarity with decolonial justice
movements around the world. [We offer this perspective as an alternative
to the hegemonic logic under which Taiwan independence must be
practically aligned with American Empire and bolstered by American
militarized peace]{.underline}. Instead, this collective statement
attempts to highlight the entrapment such thinking produces and the
violent present moment that so-called US security has generated,
especially under Trump's increasingly fascist America. Within this
context, we intend for this statement to further transpacific
conversations, collaborations, and new configurations for imagining
Taiwan and the possibility of independence during these times. Funie Hsu
The December 2, 2016, phone call between Taiwanese president Tsai
Ing-Wen and American president Donald J. Trump focused new attention on
the issue of Taiwan independence. The call set off two dominant
reactions, both problematic. On the one hand, a troubling Taiwanese
national enthusiasm celebrated the possibility of American solidarity
with Taiwan independence under a Trump presidency. On the other hand,
so-called democratic Americans shuddered in fear at the idea that the
status of an autonomous Taiwan might be validated, putting at risk the
One China recognition policy that has proved profitable to the United
States since the late 1970s. [What is missing, however, is a critical
understanding of the extreme danger of fostering Taiwanese independence
through a relationship dependent on the paternalism of American
Empire---made all the more perilous under the increasingly fascist Trump
administration---and the false security of US militarized peace in
Asia]{.underline}. As scholars, activists, and artists in Taiwan and in
the diaspora of the United States, and as allies, we are concerned with
both Taiwanese independence and Collective Statement on Taiwan
Independence \| 467 global justice. [Therefore, we urge for a critical
understanding of the inherent problems in aligning Taiwan independence
with the force of American Empire. American independence and democracy
itself have been built from violent contradictions to liberty, including
the genocide of indigenous peoples and the enslavement of Africans,
which continue today in different forms.]{.underline} [Indeed, the
United States has historically benefited from the direct suppression of
both domestic and international independence movements. Its One China
foreign policy and advocacy for maintaining the status quo in Taiwan is
yet another example of this pattern.]{.underline} [Trump's stances have
been unclear, at times expressing a willingness to break from the One
China Policy, and at other times reaffirming it.]{.underline} His
inconsistent stance on Taiwan poses fundamental dangers to Taiwanese
sovereignty and, moreover, continues the pattern of America using Taiwan
for its geopolitical interests. [Trump's America First platform would
merely continue a long history of US manipulation of Taiwan for its own
interests in the Asia Pacific]{.underline}. This historical pattern has
been most recently demonstrated through Trump's comments suggesting that
Taiwan may serve as a useful bargaining chip for a trade deal with
China. Thus Taiwanese liberation cannot rely on a dependency model of
liberty contingent on the political whims of the United States, which is
especially volatile under Trump's authoritarian brand of American
governance. We also call attention to the context of the racist,
xenophobic, misogynist, and Islamophobic platform of Trump and the
immediate threat he poses to safety and democracy in the United States
and around the globe. His executive orders to institute a Muslim ban, to
construct a wall separating the United States from Mexico, and to
continue development of the Keystone and Dakota oil pipelines are only a
few examples of the ways in which the Trump administration has advanced
extremist policies that institutionalize white nationalism, exploit the
environment, and threaten the tenets of democracy in America and abroad.
Therefore, [we find it troubling to align Taiwan independence movements
with the ongoing project of American Empire currently led by Trump.
Rather than depend wholly on America, we urge for Taiwanese independence
movements to not only distance themselves from the US Empire and Trump
but to build their freedom in solidarity with groups marginalized by
American Empire and with other global movements for decolonization
(including indigenous rights movements in Taiwan as linked to broader
international indigenous movements).]{.underline} We must establish
strong international alliances with those who are putting their bodies
on the line for justice, just as a previous generation of Taiwanese
independence leaders have done. In the United States today, this
includes the NODAPL, Black Lives Matter, and the ongoing queer and trans
468 \| American Quarterly liberation movements, to name just a few[. In
this manner, we can generate global attention for Taiwan independence by
working in solidarity with other liberation movements instead of
pandering to the political-economic desires of the US Empire. As
scholars and activists concerned with both Taiwan independence and
global justice, we call for a Taiwan independence movement that solidly
rejects **American** military empire and, instead, builds steadfast
alliance with marginalized communities and **struggles for justice
around the world. Liberation must be collective if it will be at
all.**]{.underline}

[How did it happen that Taiwan was transferred to China after World War
II?]{.underline} It is well known that the first public signal of the
island\'s postwar fate came in [the Cairo Declaration of December
1943]{.underline}, in which Prime Minister Churchill and Presidents
Roosevelt and Chiang Kai-shek [announced that]{.underline} it was
\"their purpose that \... [all the territories Japan has stolen from the
Chinese, such as Manchuria, Formosa, and the Pescadores, shall be
restored to the Republic of China.\"]{.underline} Joseph Stalin
concurred in that intention at the Teheran Conference. 1 Yet the process
of decision making that led up to that announcement has never been
explored. I became intrigued with these questions because of periodic
conversations with Taiwan friends who tend to support a Republic of
Taiwan. They point to the Cairo Declaration as the primary reason that
the island was subjected to Kuomintang (KMT) rule and all that came with
it. [Why,]{.underline} they ask, [did **the native residents of the
island not have a choice** as to who their new rulers would be, whether
Chiang Kai-shek]{.underline} (Jiang Jieshi), [Taiwanese themselves, or
someone else?]{.underline} Instead, [they assert, **the decision** at
Cairo **denied the people of Taiwan a say in their fate and** therefore
**their right of national self-determination**.]{.underline} Some have
not given up the hope that the claim of [the people of Taiwan to
ownership of \"their land\" might]{.underline}, with external help,
still be realized. 2 It is certainly true that [the People\'s Republic
of China]{.underline}, which most countries recognize as the government
of the state [called China, asserts vigorously that Taiwan is part of
China.]{.underline} The government of the Republic of China (ROC), which
has jurisdiction over Taiwan and the Pescadores, was in full agreement
up until the late 1990s (at which point its position became more
ambiguous). Moreover, [the intention of]{.underline} the World War II
[great powers to transfer ownership of Taiwan from Japan to China
**follows a long tradition** whereby the victors in war **dispose of
territories** previously held by the enemies they have vanquished and,
more generally, existing states decide on the formation of new
states.]{.underline} 3 It might be argued, moreover, that [existing
states]{.underline} should make such decisions because they [have a
**strong interest in assuring future stability** and avoiding the
territorial causes of new wars.]{.underline} Yet the peoples subject to
territorial and state changes have sometimes been given a say in the
disposition of the land in which they live. [That has happened not only
for areas whose status may change as the result of a war but also as a
mechanism employed with **non-self-governing territories that have been
under colonial rule** or international trusteeship.]{.underline} Thus
[**the peoples** of the trust territories of Micronesia, the Marshall
Islands, and Palau **voted** in plebiscites to approve compacts of free
association with the United States **upon gaining their
independence**.]{.underline} This essay seeks to bring together the
available information on when and how it was decided to return Taiwan to
China in the first place. [Four factors appear to have been at play:
U.S. government planning; Washington\'s desire to keep China in the war;
Roosevelt\'s vision for postwar security; and the impact of personal
diplomacy.]{.underline} And the decision was actually made as much as a
year before the Cairo Conference.

### L -- Territoriality

#### Ideas of territoriality are the root of settler colonialism -- they perpetuate a logic of elimination which results in genocide and human taxonomy through the grammar of race

Patrick **Wolfe**, 12-21-20**06**, Australian author; works on settler
colonialism in writing and is credited with forming ideas of the logic
of elimination; has held positions at Harvard University, Stanford
University, and La Trobe University, \"Settler colonialism and the
elimination of the native,\" Taylor & Francis,
<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14623520601056240> //nsp

[The question of genocide is never far from discussions of settler
colonialism. Land is life---or, at least, land is necessary for life.
Thus contests for land can be---indeed, often are---contests for
life]{.underline}. Yet [this is not to say that settler colonialism is
simply a form of genocide.]{.underline} In some settler-colonial sites
(one thinks, for instance, of Fiji), native society was able to
accommodate---though hardly unscathed---the invaders and the
transformative socioeconomic system that they introduced. Even in sites
of wholesale expropriation such as Australia or North America[, settler
colonialism\'s genocidal outcomes have not manifested evenly across time
or space]{.underline}. Native Title in Australia or Indian sovereignty
in the US may have deleterious features, but these are hardly equivalent
to the impact of frontier homicide. Moreover, [there can be genocide in
the absence of settler colonialism]{.underline}. The best known of all
genocides was internal to Europe, while genocides that have been
perpetrated in, for example, Armenia, Cambodia, Rwanda or (one fears)
Darfur do not seem to be assignable to settler colonialism. In this
article[, I shall begin to explore, in comparative fashion, the
relationship between genocide and the settler-colonial tendency that I
term the logic of elimination.]{.underline}1 I contend that, though the
two have converged---which is to say, [the settler-colonial logic of
elimination has manifested as genocidal]{.underline}---they should be
distinguished. [Settler colonialism is inherently eliminatory but not
invariably genocidal. As practiced by Europeans, both genocide and
settler colonialism have typically employed the organizing grammar of
race.]{.underline} European xenophobic traditions such as anti-Semitism,
Islamophobia, or Negrophobia are considerably older than race, which, as
many have shown, became discursively consolidated fairly late in the
eighteenth century.2 But [the mere fact that race is a social construct
does not of itself tell us very much]{.underline}. As I have argued,
[different racial regimes encode and reproduce]{.underline} the [unequal
relationships into which Europeans coerced]{.underline} the
[populations]{.underline} concerned. For instance, Indians and Black
people in the US have been racialized in opposing ways that reflect
their antithetical roles in the formation of US society. [Black
people\'s enslavement produced an inclusive taxonomy that automatically
enslaved the offspring of a slave and any other parent.]{.underline} In
the wake of slavery, [this taxonomy became]{.underline} fully
[racialized in the "one-drop rule," whereby any amount of African
ancestry]{.underline}, no matter how remote, and regardless of
phenotypical appearance, [makes a person Black. For Indians, in stark
contrast, non-Indian ancestry compromised their indigeneity, producing
"half-breeds," a regime that persists in the form of blood quantum
regulations. As opposed to enslaved people, whose reproduction augmented
their owners\' wealth, Indigenous people obstructed settlers\' access to
land, so their increase was counterproductive.]{.underline} In this way,
the [restrictive racial classification of Indians straightforwardly
furthered the logic of elimination. Thus we cannot simply say that
settler colonialism or genocide have been targeted at particular races,
since a race cannot be taken as given. It is made in the
targeting]{.underline}.3 3 Robert Manne has missed this point.
Responding to a question posed in 1937 by Western Australian Aboriginal
affairs functionary A. O. Neville ("Are we going to have a population of
1,000,000 blacks in the \[Australian\] Commonwealth, or are we going to
merge them into our white community and eventually forget that there
ever were any aborigines in Australia?"), Manne suggests that, in order
to "grasp the genocidal implications" of the question, "we need only
replace the words 'blacks' and 'Aborigine' \[sic\] with the word 'Jew'"
and locate the posing of the question in Berlin rather than Canberra.
Manne, "Aboriginal child removal and the question of genocide," in A.
Dirk Moses, ed., Genocide and Settler Society (Berghahn, New York,
2005), pp 219--220. Apart from its contrivance, this analogy fails
because the Nazi racialization of Jews did not conduce to their
assimilation. Rather, the reverse was the case. As Robert Gellately has
observed, "Although we can point to some similarities in Nazi plans and
actions for Jews and Slavs, there was, and remains one crucial
difference: in principle Jews could never be saved, never convert, nor
be assimilated." Gellately, "The Third Reich, the Holocaust, and visions
of serial genocide," in Gellately and Kiernan, eds, The Specter of
Genocide: mass murder in historical perspective (Cambridge: Cambridge
U.P. 2003), pp 241--263, at p 262. [Black people were racialized as
slaves; slavery constituted their blackness. Correspondingly, Indigenous
North Americans were not killed, driven away, romanticized, assimilated,
fenced in, bred White, and otherwise eliminated as the original owners
of the land but as Indians.]{.underline} Roger Smith has missed this
point in seeking to distinguish between victims murdered for where they
are and victims murdered for who they are.4 [So far as Indigenous people
are concerned, where they are is who they are, and not only by their own
reckoning. As Deborah Bird Rose has pointed out, to get in the way of
settler colonization, all the native has to do is stay at
home.]{.underline} Whatever settlers may say---and they generally have a
lot to say---[the primary motive for elimination is not race (or
religion, ethnicity, grade of civilization, etc.) but access to
territory. Territoriality is settler colonialism\'s specific,
irreducible element.]{.underline}

### L -- Terrorism

#### The affirmatives discourse of terrorism serves to justify moralized settler state expansion

**Schotten, Associate Professor of Political Science, 18**

(C. Heike, Associate Professor of Political Science and an affiliated
faculty in Women's and Gender Studies at the University of Massachusetts
Boston. Her research lies at the unlikely intersections of queer theory,
Nietzsche studies, biopolitics, and the War on Terror; August 2018,
"Queer Terror: Life, Death, and Desire in the Settler Colony", DOA:
6-25-2019, Chapter 5: Queer Terror, pp. 128-130, jwm)

This is not to say that "terrorism" and Islamophobia have nothing to do
with race.5 But it is to say that [the specific moral traction at work
in the category "terrorist" lies not simply in the racialization of this
category or the construction of a racialized Islam as the
enemy]{.underline}. It also [relies on the construal of Islam,
"terrorism," or, sometimes, "Islamic terrorism," as fundamentally the
enemy of civilization, an instantiation of nihilism, and the embodiment
of evil]{.underline}.6 Contra Foucault, this is not primarily a
biological designation. "Terrorists" are the enemies of "civilization"
not (simply) because they pose a biological threat to the population,
but rather (or also) because they portend an unthinkable destruction, an
annihilation so thoroughgoing and profound that the vocabulary of
theology is resorted to in order to adequately capture the devastation
they proffer. Biological threats may be insidious; they can be
contagious, malignant, recalcitrant, and uncontainable; they may spread
in the form of cancers or plagues. But they are not wicked or evil, the
distinguishing hallmark of the "terrorist."7 [The kind of death the
"terrorist" both represents and portends]{.underline}, then, [is not
exactly the infiltration and spread of disease so much as the
unthinkability of total destruction and the elimination of everything
known, valued, sanctified, and secure.]{.underline} ["Terrorism"
threatens a destruction that is by definition unknowable and
unimaginable, and, as such, exceeds the determinations of biology or
medical science]{.underline}. It is [a disintegration that is
existential, generating a panic other and deeper than the fact of
mortality]{.underline}. It is a destruction that cannot be borne by the
"living," threatening a disarticulation so total that it exceeds the
cessation of biological life typically demarcated by the word death, a
nihilism so baffling it can only be described by its detractors in the
supernatural language of evil. [What explains this hypermoralization of
the "death" of "terrorism" is the settler/civilizationalist specificity
of the "life" that must be protected from it]{.underline}. As I argued
in chapter 2, **[the War on Terror can be understood as a continuation
of the US settler colonial project and a morphing of that project into a
new and specifically securitized, expansionist empire.]{.underline}**
Seen in this light, **[the native becomes the original "terrorist," just
as the "terrorist" becomes today's imperial, outward projection of the
native]{.underline}**. The [championing of life that seemingly
commonsensically anchors the moralizing discourse on "terrorism"
is]{.underline}, therefore, [not an unmarked or somehow universal
valuing of "life itself]{.underline}." Instead, and as this chapter will
seek to demonstrate, **[this "life" is better understood as the lives
and wellbeing of a specifically settler America]{.underline}**--- and,
perhaps surprisingly, [Israel, in an alliance all too often construed
more broadly as simply "the West" or "democracy."]{.underline} This
civilizationalist vision of ["life" entails that any refusal of its
imperial imperatives is construed as everything that "terrorism" is
understood to be]{.underline} [in]{.underline} both right- wing and
popular [discourse]{.underline} alike: [unthinkable, annihilatory,
antilife, irrational, "savage," and evil.]{.underline} This is the
[**colonial moralism specific to "terrorism" discourse**, and it
**purchases the innocence of the "West," the existential threat posed by
"terrorism,**" and, consequently, its moral intractability as what
**must be unconditionally opposed by decent, upright, innocent
people**]{.underline}.8 **["Terrorism,"]{.underline}** then, **[can be
understood as the contemporary settler state's moralized imperial name
for the unthinkable indigenous remainder]{.underline}** that, in the
insistence on remaining, **[challenges the settler state's claim to
sovereignty, security, and civilizational value]{.underline}**. Indeed,
[indigenous peoples' continued existence not only challenges settler
sovereignty's claim to legitimacy and "first"- ness, but is the
harbinger of that sovereignty's death insofar as they become legible to
it as existing]{.underline}. Such existence gives the lie to triumphant
conquest narratives and thus threatens to dissolve the very parameters
of political intelligibility of settler biopolitics. The ([im)
moralization of indigenous peoples' persistence as indigenous,
and]{.underline} consequently as [refusers of settler sovereignty's
imposition]{.underline}, [into the impossibleto- comprehend category of
nihilist evil that devalues life--- that is, into
"terrorism"---]{.underline} is thus an important reminder that
"terrorism" is not the name of a particular form of political violence
so much as a premiere ideological tool by which resistance to empire and
colonization is illegitimated out of existence. This [use of "terrorism"
as an epithet to manage, control, stifle, quash, and punish resistance
to empire and settler colonialism is particularly clear in the smearing
and punishment of Palestinians and the Palestinian liberation
struggle]{.underline} (in both Palestine and the United States), but [it
is not unfamiliar with regard to indigenous North American
people]{.underline}(s) either, as when it [surfaced in 2016 as
indigenous and allied water protectors were surveilled, policed, and
brutalized by state and private security forces as they]{.underline}
fought the installation of the [Dakota]{.underline} [Access]{.underline}
[Pipeline]{.underline} on tribal lands in North Dakota. The
[activities]{.underline} of this entirely nonviolent movement (which
included, among other things, peace encampments, prayer vigils, and
marches insisting on the importance of water for life) [were
characterized as "terrorism" and "jihadism" by security forces and were
dealt with using anti- "terrorism" weaponry, tactics, and strategies
gleaned from the War on Terror]{.underline}.9 As these examples
demonstrate, "[terrorism" requires no actual connection with violence at
all in order to qualify as evil or credibly threaten
civilization]{.underline}. [To be a "terrorist," one need not commit an
act of violence--- political or apolitical, legitimate or not--- but,
rather, persevere as an indigenous person]{.underline}, [be (perceived
as) Arab or Muslim, or mount some explicit or forthright challenge to
the civilizationalist valuing of settler lives]{.underline} (for
example, in the form of advocating for the existence and endurance of
indigenous people\[s\]). Queer Terror therefore argues that George W.
Bush got one thing right--- however unwittingly--- in his infamous if
prophetic synopsis of War on Terror logic that one is either with "us"
or with "the terrorists." Rather than respond to Bush's ultimatum by
standing with "us" and condemning "terrorism" in a sanctimonious display
of settler survivalism, as he explicitly entreats, or standing with "us"
by valiantly seeking some sort of liberal compromise wherein we defend
"moderate" Muslims and condemn "terrorism" as extremism and by
definition abominable, as he implicitly entreats, a queer practice of
antimoral revolutionary dissent instead suggests providing Bush the only
answer to his ultimatum that is clearly off the table and choosing the
only choice that is truly unchoosable. If the only options are, as Bush
says, to side with a futurist, settler, and imperial "us" (whether as
avowed advocates of empire or its collaborationist liberal compromisers)
or with a queered, "savage," and "terrorist" other, the choice, I think,
is clear: we must choose to stand with the "terrorists."

#### The fear of the terrorist other is rooted in the original fear of the "Indian Savage" as a threat to the nation-state. Their discourse serves to justify endless violence in the name of security.

Kaplan (1998) writes that [external "threats" to the nation are
fashioned through racialized and gendered discourses]{.underline} of
violence and disease, and the nation conscripts heteronormative
masculinity and the nuclear family into its own defense (Kaplan, 1998).
Through the assumption of shared responsibility for protecting the
"American way of life," the citizen becomes contingently tethered to the
remasculinizing nation (Grewal, 2003; Mbembe, 2003). [The citizen's
freedom and rights, in turn, become possible through the containment of
the migrant, "criminal alien," and terrorist]{.underline} (Reddy, 2005;
Eng, 2010). **[With the proliferation of antiterrorism rhetoric, and as
the terrorist comes to represent that which threatens the nation's
borders, the "Middle Eastern, Arab, or Muslim"-appearing "alien" moves
from "illegal" or "criminal" to "enemy" through their racialization as a
"terrorist"]{.underline}** (de Genova, 2007; Volpp, 2002). This
dissertation attends to not just on how the "Middle Eastern, Arab, or
Muslim"-appearing "alien" is produced as an "enemy," but also how a set
of characters -- the "(violent) criminal alien," the "criminal gang
member," and the fraudulent or "dangerous" asylum seeker -- are rendered
threatening by virtue of their symbolic proximity to the "terrorist."
Following Byrd (2011), I also link [the production of the figurative
(male) "Indian (savage)," as the first "enemy" of the nation-state and
impediment to civilization, with the contemporary "terrorist." **As
derivatives of nationalist fears, the Indian and the terrorist become
representative of perceived threat to rights and
territory.**]{.underline} I focus, in particular, on how these threats
are produced in relation to the "vulnerable" and/or "risky" woman and
child(ren). Expanding on observations that discourses call on the
citizen to self-regulate risk through "choice," I trace how technologies
of security and risk produce liminal subjects, such as the (migrant)
mother of color and the queer patriot, as the bodies through which
vulnerability and threat are made legible. While the vulnerable and
innocent mother and child stand in for the risk posed to the nation by
the "risky" male migrant and the putatively abandoning and abusive
"Indian" father, the migrant mother of color and her children may also
be case as social service (over)users. I explore discourses of fitness
and contagion as reflections of the biological citizenship projects that
undergird national and tribal exclusions.

#### the war on terror is the modern incarnation of colonial expansion and control

**Beck 18** (Emilie Beck, "Re-contextualizing The War on Terror", Spring

[A key advisor to the Bush administration described the War on Terror as
a "war to remake the world"]{.underline} (Bremer 2006, p. 93). [After
the initial invasion, Paul Bremer,]{.underline} who was in charge of the
Coalition Provisional Authority, [issued four orders to liberalize
Iraq's economy. These include the 'full privatization of public
enterprises, full ownership rights by foreign firms of Iraqi businesses,
the opening of Iraq's banks to foreign control, national treatment for
foreign companies, and the elimination of nearly all trade
barriers']{.underline} (Juhasz 2004). In the neoliberal model, these are
the changes that were understood as catalysts of individual freedom.
However**[, these changes have eased foreign economic exploitation and
decreased the control that ordinary Iraqis have over their local and
national economie]{.underline}**s. Here, the [constellations of global
power, knowledge, and geography]{.underline} [**can be analyzed through
a postcolonial lens as continuing to colonize lives all over the
world,** as they are "not confined to the legatees of empires old or
new, formal or informal]{.underline}" **[but instead are deeply
entrenched in Western consciousness]{.underline}** (Gregory 2004, p.
xv). [The Bush Administration demonstrated an inability and/or refusal
to humanize and understand the 'other', **which is in this case the
'terrorist'**, in a way that comprehensively addressed the anti-U.S.
sentiments amongst them.]{.underline} This [dehumanization is indicative
of the fact that his administration, a]{.underline}nd the Obama
administration which followed, **[continue to "think and act in ways
that are dyed in the colors of colonial power"]{.underline}** (p. xv).
[People from the East are not seen as human agents in the way that
Westerners see themselves]{.underline}, and the result of this
orientalism has been devastating for millions of innocent civilians.
[The War on Terror]{.underline}, by design, [has radically transformed
spaces in order to enact new forms of social and economic organization
that are more favorable to the West]{.underline}. [The history of
colonialism which has been "forced upon the peoples it subjugated, and
the way in which it withdrew from them the right to make their own
history, ensuring that they did so emphatically not under conditions of
their own choosing"]{.underline} is **[still being carried out today
through the War on Terror]{.underline}** (Gregory 2004, p. 10). The
United States has imposed economic liberalization through mass strategic
violence. Multinational corporations have increasing access to land and
resources in these spaces. [With U.S. imperial presence and the daily
realities of war]{.underline}, [Afghans and Iraqis have less and less of
a say in how to organize their social, political, and economic
lives.]{.underline}

Some partial conclusions: [coloniality incorporates colonialism and
imperialism but goes beyond them]{.underline}; [this is why coloniality
did not end with the end of colonialism]{.underline} (formal
independence of nation states), **[but was rearticulated in terms of the
post-World War II imaginary of three world]{.underline}**s (which in
turn replaced the previous articulations in terms of Occidentalism and
Orientalism). Similarly, [the 'end of the Third World' entails a
rearticulation of the coloniality of power and knowledge.
A]{.underline}s we have seen, **[this rearticulation takes the form of
both imperial globality]{.underline}** ([new global link between
economic and military power]{.underline}) **[and global
coloniality]{.underline}** [(the emergent classificatory orders and
forms of alterisation that are replacing the cold war
order]{.underline}). The new coloniality regime is still difficult to
discern. [Race, class and ethnicity will continue to be important, but
new, or newly prominent, areas of articulation come into existence, such
as religion (and gender linked to it, especially in the case of Islamic
societies, as we saw in the war on Afghanistan]{.underline}). However,

### L -- Trade

#### Settlers owe indigenous folk an immeasurable debt---neoliberal trade is just a continuation of Settler financialization that serves to deny Indigenous folk resources

Toward a Decolonial Financial Literacy [I am called to
account]{.underline} for Stoetzler and Yuval-Davis's (2002) [notion of
the radical imagination: it must always be situated in the bodies and
relationships of its bearers]{.underline}. As such, for me, [a settler
subject within the state of Canada and a beneficiary of a
settler-colonial system, part of this process would begin by studying
the links between settler colonialism and financialization]{.underline}
and the ways in which the two are historically and presently
intertwined. This would take up the thread accidentally dropped in the
First Nations Financial Fitness booklet, which, in spite of itself,
hinted at the promise of another, decolonial economics underneath. The
mainstream colonial microeconomic thinking that undergirds most
financial literacy campaigns would consign practices like the potlatch
to its own long-transcended prehistory, naming it a form of "primitive"
and mystical exchange superseded by the evolution of money, credit,
debt, and financial infrastructures (see Graeber 2011; Sahlins 1972).
But if we take seriously the idea that the potlatch was an alternative
form of economic practice with its own set of literacies as (if not
more) sophisticated as Wall Street's necromancy, we can use it to hold
"our" own settler-colonial tradition of financialization up to
productive scrutiny. [The decolonial work for settlers is not to seek to
fully understand or claim the potlatch as our own; such would be an act
of violent cultural appropriation]{.underline} (see Hopkins 2011) [and
also a romanticization of a grounded, particular tradition]{.underline}.
Rather, by [recognizing the potlatch as a possible form of financial
literacy and practice, we call into question the otherwise unstated or
unrecognized assumptions that support our own settler-colonial financial
practices and the social, economic, and ecological violence they enact.
A decolonial financial literacy]{.underline} might also [concern itself
with recognizing and acknowledging the debts that a settler society
owes]{.underline} and [a]{.underline} fundamental [reconsideration of
what repaying or offering restitution for those debts would
mean]{.underline}. Some of these debts are literal. For instance, [the
Canadian government currently owes potentially billions of dollars to
Indigenous nations for the rental of land and resources of their
lands]{.underline}, monies that have been held in "trust" for generation
after generation (Alfred 2009; Six Nations Lands and Resources
Department 2010). These are only the literal, financial debts---[the
historical and moral debts go much deeper]{.underline}. Legal
settlements around the genocidal abuse of Indigenous people in
residential schools, as meager as they have been, give us a small
indication of the scope of such obligations (Borrows 2014; Henderson
2015). [They are being joined, slowly, by suits from the survivors (or
descendants of survivors) of other, similarly genocidal government
programs]{.underline} (see Spencer 2017). We might also add the suits
that are pending, or ought to be pending, for the destruction of
Indigenous people's lands and livelihoods thanks to the forms of
environmental racism and outright resource theft since before Canada's
foundations (see Ilyniak 2014; Mascarenhas 2014; Shkilnyk 1985). We
might add the suits of all those Indigenous people who, because they
were stripped of their status by the Indian Act (because they didn't
have the correct blood quantum, or because they or their ancestors broke
some government-imposed rule), have not had the opportunity to benefit
from their rights as enshrined in the treaties (Bhandar 2016; Hanson
2009). Then there is a case for the purely economic damage done to
Indigenous communities through the vicissitudes of the racist Indian
Act, which, for instance, withheld full fiduciary rights from Indigenous
people for generations (and still), ensuring they and their members
would never gain access to the same means of financial investment that
enabled settlers and settler communities to develop their infrastructure
and capacities (see Pasternak 2015; Vowel 2016). [We could also speak of
the debt for all those (already insufficient) funds and resources that
were (and are) diverted from Indigenous communities by the agents and
bureaucrats of the (recently renamed) Department of Indian
Affairs]{.underline} (see Manuel and Derrickson 2015). [We might include
here the debt incurred by the Canadian government]{.underline} (and, by
extension, its citizens and beneficiaries) [by the outlawing of the
potlatch ceremonies described earlier]{.underline}, from 1884 to after
WWII, a prohibition that explicitly sought to undermine the independent
West Coast Indigenous economy and only one of many examples of
systematic efforts to undermine Indigenous sovereignty and autonomy
(Alfred 2009). Here, not only am I talking about the tangible, material
debt for all those thousands upon thousands of Indigenous artifacts and
objects of art and ritual that were seized by the Canadian state and
later given, sold, or loaned to museums in Canada and around the world
(when they weren't simply destroyed, despoiled, or stolen by colonial
enforcement officers) (see Phillips 2012). [I am also talking about the
debt for a systematic econocide. And then **there are the unpaid debts
for the land itself**.]{.underline} [It is]{.underline} by now widely
[acknowledged that the vast majority of historical treaties were signed
based on a (convenient) fundamental colonial misunderstanding, or under
extreme duress]{.underline} (Asch 2014; Borrows 2010; Gehl 2014).
Appropriate [compensation for these lands has not been
offered]{.underline} or agreed to in the vast majority of cases. And,
**[indeed, even by settler legal precedent, the compensation should at
least approximate the reasonable expectation of future enjoyment and
profit that has been denied to Indigenous people and communities thanks
to the loss of this "resource."]{.underline}** (This is, for instance,
the principle that guides the hypothetical compensation to corporations
if Canada or other member nations abrogate such neoliberal trade
treaties as the North American Free Trade Agreement.) In Defense of
Bankruptcy [In all likelihood]{.underline}, were Canada [to attempt to
repay these debts, even in part, it would be bankrupt. The compound debt
owed to Indigenous people is, essentially, immeasurable. But, in
reality, the settler-colonial state is already bankrupt, and it always
was]{.underline}. Even by its own laws, the nation's claims to
legitimacy are tenuous, based as they are on colonial violence and
expropriation (Mackey 2016). Yet on a fundamentally deeper level [this
bankruptcy represents a moral rot at the heart of the nation that, while
it has enriched itself and some of its citizens]{.underline} (mostly the
white, male ones; see Smith 2006) [based on the expropriation,
exploitation, and destruction of Indigenous lands]{.underline}, [remains
fixated on achieving wealth and success by feeding omnicidal
financialized capitalist markets]{.underline} (Coulthard 2014). More
profoundly, [this bankruptcy is felt in the form of a highly alienating
and nihilistic society that has essentially been created to facilitate
the private accumulation of settler wealth based on the principles of
competition and exploitation]{.underline} (see Lowman and Barker 2015;
Cornell and Seely 2015). Much, much more can be, has been, and should be
said about each of these points, but time here does not permit. Suffice
it for now to say that observations like these, and others, would need
to be central to a form of decolonial financial literacy, one that
fundamentally undermines not only the financialized notion of debt and
credit but also of wealth itself. While [by neoliberal accounting,
Canada is a wealthy]{.underline}, G8 [nation]{.underline} (though one
would be hard-pressed to recognize it, given the rhetoric of state
austerity), [on another, deeper level, an audit of Canada as a
settler-colonial state reveals it is not only tremendously in debt to
the point of financial bankruptcy but also dwelling in an abject
cultural and moral poverty.]{.underline} Such an accounting, such a
literacy, would need to be based, as well, in maneuvers that would sever
settler subjects from their fidelity to the state and the capitalist
system it serves (see Lowman and Barker 2015). [The conscription of
settlers has always depended on making settlers into financialized
subjects ready to partner with that state (and economy]{.underline}) for
their own enrichment. And some (generally though not exclusively white,
male) have indeed become rich, by the measurements of the
settler-colonial capitalism: dollars in the bank, material property,
exclusively owned land (see Day 2016). But [to succeed, theoretically
and politically]{.underline}, such a decolonial financial literacy
[would have to go beyond merely demanding that the misbegotten wealth of
settlers and the settler-colonial state writ large be reclaimed or
redistributed. **It would also depend on educating ourselves to
recognize value very differently**]{.underline} (see Haiven 2014b). [It
would not]{.underline}, for instance, [be sufficient only to imagine
(re)appropriating houses, lands, mines, factories, cities, institutions,
and resources to redistribute them, first, to compensate Indigenous
people for their losses and]{.underline}, second, perhaps, to distribute
them more equally among settlers. **[Rather (or in addition), it would
require a reimagination of wealth itself]{.underline}**. Certain
[allegedly wealth-producing assets]{.underline}, such as the Alberta Tar
Sands and [most large-scale mines]{.underline}, [would]{.underline}
likely [need to be recognized as actually destructive of the wealth of
the nonhuman world (and also of human health) and
abolished]{.underline}. This would unavoidably have dramatic effects on
the Canadian economy, at least in terms of its competitiveness with
other capitalist nation-states. Taken to its full extent, it may
economically bankrupt the nation within the global capitalist economy as
it exists. And somehow [this would need to be seen not as a loss but as
a collective liberation, not simply for Indigenous people but for
settlers as well.]{.underline} Hence, a radical, decolonial financial
literacy has to take seriously what it would mean to share
responsibility and love for the land and recognize it as the source of
our wealth (see Armstrong 2007). And [it would need to do more than
simply generate sorrow and shame based on settlers' evident collective
debts]{.underline}: it would need to show that reconciliation is more
than the balancing of financial accounts. [The only way to "repay" such
debts would be to decolonize the land, which is to say repatriate it to
Indigenous nations]{.underline} (see Tuck and Yang 2012), [and transform
settlers into collective subjects worthy of living on and caring for the
land with its other human and nonhuman inhabitants. Such an exercise is
not merely a matter of intellectual learning]{.underline} and
theoretical conjecture. **[It is learned on the front lines, when
settlers break ranks with the settler-colonial state and the capitalist
economy and make common cause with Indigenous land
defenders]{.underline}** (see Coulthard 2014). In this sense, [the
protest camp or the blockade, such as the dramatic convergence around
the Standing Rock Sioux protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline in
2016 and 2017, is the institution of this new financial literacy, a
place where debts and credits are bestowed and paid not in money but in
solidarity]{.underline} and where a certain fitness is exercised (see
Barker and Ross 2017). We are, in these struggles, learning to become
literate in our own powers.

### L -- University 

#### Universities are complicit in settler colonialism 

**Morgensen 12** (Morgensen, Scott Lauria. "Destabilizing the Settler
Academy: The Decolonial Effects of Indigenous Methodologies." American
Quarterly, vol. 64, no. 4, 2012, p. 805. Scott Lauria Morgensen is
associate professor in the Department of Gender Studies at Queen's
University.)//bc

Indigenous methodologies thus demand the interrogation of colonial
academic procedures. Many critiques exist of the incapacity of
universities to support Indigenous research, a situation that all too
often follows explicit restrictions on such work.8 Yet by contrast, [my
experience]{.underline} in Canada **[illuminates growing efforts by
settler states and universities to accommodate Indigenous research under
governmental logics of inclusion or reconciliation]{.underline}**, in a
moment Elizabeth Povinelli has diagnosed as "liberal settler
multiculturalism."9 [A key site of this effect is ethics review, wherein
state law and university employees govern Indigenous research under the
aegis of "protection from harm."]{.underline} [Ethical imperatives have
informed Indigenous critiques of colonial research]{.underline}, as well
as non-Indigenous scholars' advocacy for ethics review as a counter to
scientific violences.10 Yet [if Indigenous methodologies are rooted in
decolonization, then their "recognition," which is to say their
incorporation within the governance structures of a settler academy,
presents a creative adaptation of colonial power that sustains colonial
rule.]{.underline} I write this as a member of and applicant to my
university's ethics review boards and as a mentor for Indigenous
students who propose research to boards on which I have sat.11 My
participation has revealed to me that [colonial principles set the legal
standard for determining the nature or evidence of "harm" in research
with Indigenous people]{.underline}. For instance, [if one succeeds in
convincing reviewers (almost always non-Indigenous)]{.underline} [that
one's work bears an ethical relationship to Indigenous research
subjects, the work then must be introduced to subjects under the
university's authority]{.underline}, [not that of any Indigenous body.
Asemblance that Indigenous people possess this authority appears when
applicants are asked if their research requires "Band Council
approval]{.underline}." The framing of the question effectively invites
applicants to devise a reason not to seek such approval, given that this
would omit an additional stage of review. Yet myriad [reasons may lead
Indigenous researchers to question band councils as proper evaluators
for their work.]{.underline} Hundreds of councils exist in Canada in the
wake of two centuries of divide-and-conquer tactics that thieved
territories by dividing peoples into "bands" as governmental targets of
the Indian Act. [Alfred eloquently explains that with Canadian law as
its horizon,]{.underline} [band council authority often suppresses
traditional governance and obstructs its resurgence]{.underline}.12 [To
establish band councils as Indigenous authority within ethics review
thus mediates knowledge about Indigenous people using two apparatuses of
liberal settler multiculturalism**: "self-governance," devolved within
colonial law**]{.underline}; [and]{.underline} **["protection" as a
means of entering the academy and its funder, the state.]{.underline}**
By contrast, [Indigenous methodologies envision the termination of
colonial rule]{.underline}, [by fomenting the knowledges of sovereign
and decolonizing peoples:]{.underline} that is, kn[owledges that subvert
the ontology of a perpetually colonial society toward radical
transformations of land, life, and governance.]{.underline}

#### The 1AC abandons Ukraine to Russian colonialist motives to build and maintain an imperial empire, similar to the US

As Samuel Huntington argued, [colonies "refer to the settlements created
by people who leave a mother country and travel elsewhere to establish a
new society on distant turf,"]{.underline} a definition that is
"entirely different from a 'colony' in the later meaning given the term,
that is, a territory and its indigenous people ruled by the government
of another people." The very term "colony" goes back to antiquity, when
colonization was the most common means of exploring new territories
without directly conquering them. Colonies served not so much as
outposts for military expansion as "trade missions" established by the
most advanced nations. According to various estimates, from the 10th to
the 6th century B.C.E. the Phoenicians founded more than 200 settlements
with a total population of 450,000 people all over the Mediterranean and
even on the Atlantic coasts of today's Spain and Morocco. From the 9th
to the 5th century B.C.E. the Greeks founded about 1,500 colonies from
the coast of the Black Sea to Gibraltar, which at their peak were
inhabited by more than a 1.5 million people---in remote areas a new
polis might even be created in partnership with local tribes. [All these
cities nurtured the cultural, social, and political traditions of the
regions from which their founders came, maintaining close relationships
with them]{.underline}. [Though it embarked on an expansionist path of
development together with its fellow European nations in the 15th
century,]{.underline} [Russia stands alone after half a millennium as a
great power that has preserved its giant settler colony]{.underline}.
Many of those who witnessed the scope and the wealth of Siberia believe
that this land could become Russia's greatest treasure, if only Moscow
is ready to recognize its real value. [Today it is in both Russia's and
the West's interests to develop Russia's eastern regions, creating
another edge of the Western presence along the Pacific. If we understand
the colonial nature of Russia's east properly, we see that Russia and
the United States, as two products of European culture and the European
politics, can indeed develop a sustainable partnership and consolidate
their presence on the Pacific Rim.]{.underline} If it does not realize
this agenda and secure its periphery[, Russia]{.underline} will fail to
become a successful 21st-century nation. Worse, it [may follow the path
of the old European empires, causing a crisis incommensurate even with
that of the early 1990s]{.underline}. For centuries [Russia was a nation
that tried to expand into neighboring lands]{.underline}. There is
nothing shameful in that---Americans are proud of their ancestors who
turned a vast land into a modern and prosperous nation. Russians must
rethink their past and present in order to meet today's challenges: They
must forget about [their dependencies and concentrate on their enormous
colony that, if properly managed, may once again elevate Russia to a
position among the world's most powerful nations.]{.underline}

### L -- Util

#### Mill's utilitarianism was historically used as a justification for colonization -- reject it on face

**Campbell 10** (Craig Grant Campbell (2010) 'Mill's Liberal Project and
Defence of Colonialism from a Post-Colonial Perspective', South African
Journal of Philosophy, 29:2, 63-73, DOI: 10.4314/sajpem.v29i2.57049.

[Colonial rule was thus not a moral concern for either of the Mill\'s in
that both believed it was good and just because it advanced civilization
and promoted the general welfare of the colonized
population]{.underline}. John Stuart [Mill constantly defended the role
of the East India Company before Britain\'s Parliament and went to great
lengths to describe the multitude of ways in which Indian society had
benefitted from British rule]{.underline}, especially with regard to
public services and the establishment of political and social
institutions. In 1853, for example, he stated: 'It must be said that the
years which have since elapsed have been marked by a degree of activity
in every description of public improvement, not only greater than that
exhibited previously, but unsurpassed, it is believed, in any country in
any age' (Mill 1977b:93). [The above highlights Mill\'s belief that the
mission of the East India Company was to help provide Indian society
with the stimulus necessary for development and progress, without which
they would remain a backward and stagnant race. Mill\'s views on
colonialism reflected the age in which he lived, when few Europeans
questioned the notion that their cultures were far superior to other
contemporary cultures]{.underline}, that Western European society was at
the forefront of development and civilization, and thus that it was
their moral duty to spread their 'ways' to all peoples of the world
(Habibi 1999:125). [Mill\'s admiration for European culture and
justification for British paternalism, is highlighted by his claim that,
'among the inhabitants of our earth, the European family of nations is
the only one which has ever yet to show any capability of spontaneous
improvement beyond a certain low-level']{.underline} (Mill 1977c:197).
Mill\'s claim that ['...despotism is a legitimate mode of dealing with
barbarians, provided the end be their improvement]{.underline}...'
offers further support for his colonialism and his acknowledgement of
the superiority of European cultures as the most progressive forces to
stimulate growth and development within stagnant, non-progressive
societies (Mill 1977a:224). [Backward societies, according to Mill, had
no right to non-interference as he did not believe that progression was
a 'natural, historical process', but rather that 'backward' societies
would remain in such a state unless there was paternalistic intervention
by a more developed nation. Founded on his utilitarian justification,
Mill claimed that in comparison to the chaos and despotism it replaced,
British rule provided order, unification and a liberal challenge to the
traditional repression which fuelled the stagnation of most 'backward'
societies]{.underline}. This 'vision' is evident in the fact that Mill
vehemently opposed a system of indirect rule where the 'British propped
up Indian princes as semi-autonomous allies and used them as bulwarks
against possible threats from other princes or rebellious subjects', and
believed that such a system was detrimental to the 'Imperial task'
(Zastoupil 1988:37). Indirect rule merely protected the atrocious
behaviour of, what was considered by Mill, a 'barbaric' and 'backward'
social system. **[Direct British rule, on the other hand, was the only
appropriate method to fulfil the 'civilising mission' of colonial rule
and therefore advocated the importance of good administration to
bringing about social and political improvement.]{.underline}**

## RC/Impact

### Environment

#### Settler colonialism is responsible for climate change based on the death of indigenous peoples

**Ferreira 19** (Becky 2-1-2019, \"European Genocide of Indigenous
Peoples in the Americas Cooled Earth's Climate,\" Vice,
https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bjqnqq/european-genocide-of-indigenous-peoples-in-the-americas-cooled-earths-climate)//SR

[Some 50 million Indigenous peoples died during the 16th century, a
collapse that caused atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to
drop]{.underline}. Machu Picchu was one of the settlements abandoned in
the wake of European colonization. [The mass deaths of Indigenous
American peoples 500 years ago---caused by disease and violence spread
by European colonizers---was so extreme]{.underline} that it cooled
Earth's climate[, according to a [new study in Quaternary Science
Reviews](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379118307261)]{.underline}.
Led by Alexander Koch, a graduate student in geography at University
College London, the authors said that a period of global cooling that
lasted from the 16th to 19th centuries was partly caused by [epidemics
and warfare that killed 90 percent of the Indigenous population in just
100 years. The devastating loss, known as the Great Dying, left 56
million hectares of farmland unattended, enabling forests and other
vegetation to grow over agricultural terrains. The rewilded landscapes
drank in much more carbon dioxide than the preceding farms, which
reduced levels of the greenhouse gas in the atmosphere by 7-10 parts per
million. With fewer CO2 molecules to trap heat on Earth, global
temperatures dropped by 0.15°C in an event called the Little Ice
Age.]{.underline} "[We conclude that the Great Dying of the Indigenous
Peoples of the Americas led to the abandonment of enough cleared land in
the Americas that the resulting terrestrial carbon uptake had a
detectable impact on both atmospheric CO2 and global surface air
temperatures in the two centuries prior to the Industrial
Revolution,"]{.underline} Koch's team said in the paper. The researchers
came to this conclusion by modeling the amount of carbon that would be
stored by vegetative regrowth on fallow land. Using over 100 regional
estimates, they calculated that the pre-Columbian Indigenous population
totaled around 60.5 million people, mostly concentrated in Central and
South America. These communities farmed crops like maize, beans, squash,
and quinoa, often in irrigated terraces built on mountain slopes. [By
1600, only five or six million survivors of this once expansive
civilization remained. The rest were wiped out by European-introduced
diseases like smallpox and measles, with a smaller percentage killed by
warfare, slavery, and famine. Koch\'s team used models to estimate that
some 7.4 billion metric tonnes of carbon would have been sequestered by
subsequent landscape changes, enough to have a significant impact on
Earth's climate.]{.underline} The study supports [previous
research](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qkvngv/the-year-1610-marks-the-beginning-of-the-anthropocene)
that places the onset date of the Anthropocene, the era of large-scale
human influence on Earth's systems, in the year 1610, when atmospheric
CO2 levels began to decrease partly as a result of the Great Dying. "Our
results also show that this aspect of [the Columbian Exchange---the
globalization of diseases---had global impacts on the Earth
system,"]{.underline} the researchers said. This is "key evidence in the
calls for the drop in atmospheric CO2 at 1610 CE to mark the onset of
the Anthropocene epoch."

#### Colonization is the root cause of the environment

Alycee **Lane** 11/18/**16** \[Alycee Lane is an author and writer for
Truthout; Truthout, Why "**[Climate Change" Must Become a Promise to
Decolonize]{.underline}**\] \[DS\]
\[https://truthout.org/articles/why-climate-change-must-become-a-promise-to-decolonize/\]

The actions taken recently by law enforcement at the Dakota Access
pipeline site have made it plain that **[the climate crisis cannot be
adequately addressed until we come to terms with the history that
climate change and the policing of communities of color share. That
history requires us both to understand climate change as powered in
great measure by the pursuit of policies and practices done to people of
color, and to see our radically altered global atmosphere itself as part
of the felt experience of people of color, and of continued repression
and exploitation.]{.underline}** Like the racist policing we witnessed
at the Dakota Access pipeline (and have been witnessing throughout the
nation), [climate change]{.underline} was[,]{.underline} as feminist
philosopher Chris J. Cuomo reminds us, "manufactured in a crucible of
inequality." Specifically, it [is "a product of the industrial and the
fossil-fuel eras, historical forces powered by exploitation, colonialism
and nearly limitless instrumental use of 'nature.\'"]{.underline} In
other words, [the processes by which the colonial powers created their
wealth and warmed the planet were, as legal scholar Carmen G. Gonzalez
notes, inextricable from the oppressive practices they used to both
transform the "subsistence economies" of the Global South "into economic
satellites of Europe," and to dominate and exploit people of color
around the globe.]{.underline} Though we live now in a postcolonial
world, it is nevertheless true, as Leonardo Helland and Tim Lindgren
argue, that "[long-standing patterns and forms of power" continue to be
"reproduced throughout the world as an ongoing consequence of
colonization]{.underline}." After all, the "structures" that were "put
in place" over the course of "450 years [did not evaporate with ...
decolonization]{.underline}." [We "continue to live under the 'colonial
power matrix,\'" to which the repressive policing of people of color and
the extraction of fossil fuels --- often done hand-in-hand --- are as
crucial as they were before decolonization]{.underline}. In this regard,
climate change continues to be manufactured in a crucible of inequality
--- though the production of our altered climate is something in which
most of us the world over are complicit --- and [our carbon-saturated
atmosphere continues to bear the marks of repression and
exploitation]{.underline}. We could say that the colonial power matrix
is literally in the air. Indeed, it was in the air when G4S --- the
private security team hired by Dakota Access, LLC --- set its dogs on
the Standing Rock Sioux as they resisted the construction of the Dakota
Access pipeline on their land because the pipeline will contaminate
their drinking water, destroy or harm sacred sites, and ultimately
contribute to climate change. It was in the air when machine
gun-wielding and riot-outfitted local police descended upon, maced,
clubbed, arrested and strip-searched pipeline protesters. And it was in
the air during the military checkpoints conducted by the National Guard
deployed outside of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. In fact, the
radically altered atmosphere in which the pipeline struggle has been
taking place is actually a thing that Dakota Access LLC's private
security and the state are literally defending on behalf of people who
--- in the tradition of colonial settlers of the past --- believe they
are entitled to disregard at will Indigenous rights as well as treaty
obligations. For it is not the mere construction of a pipeline that
these security forces hope to safeguard for Dakota Access LLC and other
corporate interests. It is, more critically, the actual burning or
release of fossil fuels and thus the manufacture of a chemically altered
atmosphere --- because therein lies the profit. The pipeline project
actually requires the exploitation of Native lands (as opposed to land
occupied primarily by whites), the repression of the Sioux, the fouling
of natural resources and, finally, the burning or release of fossil
fuels. Ultimately, the Dakota Access pipeline is a project in which
rising global temperatures are the necessary end result. "[Climate
change" cannot contain any longer the history of exploitation that
produced our radically altered atmosphere and the politics of domination
that continue to produce it.]{.underline} In fact, "climate change" must
become a promise to speak everywhere and all the time of our altered
climate --- and even our "extreme weather events" --- in terms that
conjure (for example) conquest, colonialism, settlers, genocide,
apartheid, reservations, indentured servitude, rape, Bantustans, Jim
Crow, racial segregation, annexation, partition, national liberation,
neocolonialism, Western-propped dictatorships, proxy wars,
neoliberalism, policing, regime change and treaty violations.
Ultimately, however, "[climate change" must be a commitment to undertake
a radical politics of decoloniality --- to dismantle the murderous,
nihilistic colonial power matrix against which the Sioux are
courageously fighting and which is assailing Indigenous communities
wherever fossil fuel exists, all the while driving millions of life
forms to extinction.]{.underline}

If nineteenth-century American literary studies tends to focus on the
ways Indians enter the narrative frame and the kinds of meanings and
associa- tions they bear, [recent attempts to theorize settler
colonialism have sought to **shift attention from its effects on
Indigenous subjects** to its implications for **nonnative political
attachments, forms of inhabitance, and modes of being**,]{.underline}
illuminating and tracking the pervasive operation of settlement as a
system. In Settler Colonialism and the Transformation of Anthropology,
Patrick Wolfe argues, "Settler colonies were (are) premised on the
elimination of native societies. The split tensing reflects a
determinate feature of settler colonization. [The colonizers come to
stay]{.underline}---**[invasion is a structure not an
event]{.underline}**" (2).6 He suggests [that a "logic of elimination"
drives settler governance and sociality,]{.underline} describing "[the
settler-colonial will]{.underline}" as "a historical force that
[ultimately derives from the primal drive to expansion]{.underline} that
is generally glossed as capitalism" (167), and in "Settler Colonialism
and the Elimination of the Native," he observes that "[**elimination is
an organizing principle of settler-colonial society** rather than a
one-off]{.underline} (and superceded) [occurrence]{.underline}" (388).
Rather than being superseded after an initial moment/ period of
conquest, colonization persists since "[the logic of elimination marks a
return whereby **the native repressed continues to structure settler-
colonial society**]{.underline}" (390). In Aileen Moreton-Robinson's
work, whiteness func- tions as the central way of understanding the
domination and displacement of Indigenous peoples by nonnatives.7 In
"Writing Off Indigenous Sover- eignty," she argues, "As a regime of
power, patriarchal white sovereignty operates ideologically, materially
and discursively to reproduce and main- tain its investment in the
nation as a white possession" (88), and in "Writ- ing Off Treaties," she
suggests, "[**At an ontological level the structure of subjective
possession** occurs through the imposition of one's will-to-be on the
thing which is perceived to lack will, thus it is]{.underline} **[open
to being possessed]{.underline}**," such that "[possession . . .
forms]{.underline} part of **[the ontological structure of white
subjectivity]{.underline}**" (83--84). For Jodi Byrd, the deployment of
Indianness as a mobile figure works as the principal mode of U.S.
settler colonialism. She observes that "[**colonization and
racialization . . . have often been conflated**," in ways
that]{.underline} "tend to be sited along the axis of
inclusion/exclusion" and that "**[misdirect and cloud attention from the
underlying structures of settler colonialism]{.underline}**" (xxiii,
xvii). She argues that [settlement works through the translation of
indigeneity as Indianness]{.underline}, casting place-based political
collec- tivities as (racialized) populations subject to U.S.
jurisdiction and manage- ment: "[the Indian is left nowhere and
everywhere within the ontological premises through which U.S. empire
orients]{.underline}, imagines, and critiques itself "; "[ideas
of]{.underline} Indians and [Indianness have served as]{.underline}
**[the ontological ground through which U.S. settler colonialism enacts
itself]{.underline}** " (xix).

### 2NC -- Inequality

#### Colonialism is the root cause of capitalist inequality

**Acemoglu 19** (Daron Acemoglu, \"How Colonialism Shaped Modern
Inequality\", naked capitalism, 6-27-2019,
https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2017/02/how-colonialism-shaped-modern-inequality.html,
6-27-2019. Daron Acemoglu, Professor of Applied Economics, MIT and James
Robinson, Professor, University of Chicago Harris School of Public
Policy. Originally published at VoxEU.) //bc

The immense [economic inequality we observe in the world today didn't
happen overnight, or even in the past century**. It is the
path-dependent outcome of a multitude of historical processes, one of
the most important of which has been European
colonialism.**]{.underline} Retracing our steps 500 years, or back to
the verge of this colonial project, we see little inequality and small
differences between poor and rich countries (perhaps a factor of four).
Now the differences are a factor of more than 40, if we compare the
richest to the poorest countries in the world. What role did colonialism
play in this? In our research with Simon Johnson we have shown that
[colonialism has shaped modern inequality in several fundamental, but
heterogeneous, ways]{.underline}. In Europe [the discovery of the
Americas and the emergence of a mass colonial project]{.underline},
first in the Americas, and then, subsequently, in Asia and Africa,
[potentially helped to spur institutional and economic
development]{.underline}, [thus setting in motion some of the
prerequisites for what was to become the industrial
revolution]{.underline} (Acemoglu et al. 2005). But the way this worked
was conditional on institutional differences within Europe. In places
like Britain, where an early struggle against the monarchy had given
parliament and society the upper hand, [the discovery of the Americas
led to the further empowerment of mercantile and industrial groups, who
were able to benefit from the new economic opportunities that the
Americas, and soon Asia, presented]{.underline} and to push for improved
political and economic institutions. [The consequence was economic
growth]{.underline}. In other places, such as Spain, where the initial
political institutions and balance of power were different, the outcome
was different. The monarchy dominated society, trade and economic
opportunities, and in consequence, political institutions became weaker
and the economy declined. As Marx and Engels put it in the Communist
Manifesto, "The discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened
up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie." It did, but only in some
circumstances. In others it led to a retardation of the bourgeoisie. In
consequence [colonialism drove economic development in some parts of
Europe and prevented ~~retarded~~ it in others. Colonialism did not,
however, merely impact the development of those societies that did the
colonising]{.underline}. Most obviously[, it also affected the societies
that were colonised.]{.underline} In our research (Acemoglu et al. 2001,
2002) we showed that this, again, had heterogeneous effects. This is
because **[colonialism ended up creating very distinct sorts of
societies in different places]{.underline}**. In particular,
[colonialism left very different institutional legacies in different
parts of the world, with profoundly divergent consequences for economic
development.]{.underline} The reason for this is not that the various
European powers transplanted different sorts of institutions -- so that
North America succeeded due to an inheritance of British institutions,
while Latin America failed because of its Spanish institutions. In fact,
the evidence suggests that the intentions and strategies of distinct
colonial powers were very similar (Acemoglu and Robinson 2012). The
outcomes were very different because of variation in initial conditions
in the colonies. For example, in Latin America, where there were dense
populations of indigenous people, a colonial society could be created
based on the exploitation of these people. In North America where no
such populations existed, such a society was infeasible, even though the
first British settlers tried to set it up. In response, early [North
American society went in a completely different direction: early
colonising ventures, such as the Virginia Company, needed to attract
Europeans and stop them running off into the open frontier and they
needed to incentivise them to work and invest. The institutions that did
this, such as political rights and access to land, were radically
different even from the institutions in the colonising
country.]{.underline} When British colonisers found Latin-American-like
circumstances, for example in South Africa, Kenya or Zimbabwe, they were
perfectly capable of and interested in setting up what we have called
'extractive institutions', based on the control of and the extraction of
rents from indigenous peoples. In Acemoglu and Robinson (2012) we argue
that [extractive institutions, which strip the vast mass of the
population of incentives or opportunities**, are associated with
poverty**]{.underline}. It is also not a coincidence that such African
societies are today as unequal as Latin American countries. It wasn't
just the density of indigenous peoples that mattered for the type of
society that formed. As we showed in Acemoglu et al. (2001), the disease
environment facing potential European settlers was also important.
Something that encouraged the colonisation of North America was the
relatively benign disease environment that facilitated the strategy of
creating institutions to guarantee European migration. Something that
encouraged the creation of extractive institutions in West Africa was
the fact that it was the 'white man's graveyard', discouraging the
creation of the type of 'inclusive economic institutions' which
encouraged the settlement and development of North America. These
inclusive institutions, in contrast to extractive institutions, did
create incentives and opportunities for the vast mass of people. Our
focus on the disease environment as a source of variation in colonial
societies was not because we considered this to be the only or even the
main source of variation in the nature of such societies. It was for a
particular scientific reason: we argued that the historical factors that
influenced the disease environment for Europeans and therefore their
propensity to migrate to a particular colony are not themselves a
significant source of variation in economic development today. More
technically, this meant that historical measures of European settler
mortality could be used as an instrumental variable to estimate the
causal effect of economic institutions on economic development (as
measured by income per-capita). The main challenge to this approach is
that factors which influenced European mortality historically may be
persistent and can influence income today, perhaps via effects on health
or contemporary life expectancy. There are several reasons why this is
not likely to be true however. First, our measures of European mortality
in the colonies are from 200 or so years ago, before the founding of
modern medicine or the understanding of tropical diseases. Second, they
are measures of mortality faced by Europeans with no immunity to
tropical diseases, which is something very different from the mortality
faced by indigenous people today, which is presumably what is relevant
for current economic development in these countries. Just to check, we
also showed that our results are robust to the controlling
econometrically of various modern measures of health, such as malaria
risk and life expectancy. Thus, just [as colonialism had heterogeneous
effects on development within Europe]{.underline}, promoting it in
places like Britain, but retarding it in Spain, [so it also had very
heterogeneous effects in the colonies]{.underline}. [In some places,
like North America, it created societies with far more inclusive
institutions than in the colonising country itself and planted the seeds
for the immense current prosperity of the region.]{.underline} [In
others, such as Latin America, Africa or South Asia, it created
extractive institutions that led to very poor long-run development
outcomes. The fact that colonialism had positive effects on development
in some contexts **does not mean that it did not have devastating
negative effects on indigenous populations and society. It
did.**]{.underline} That colonialism in the early modern and modern
periods had heterogeneous effects is made plausible by many other pieces
of evidence. For example, Putnam (1994) proposed that it was the Norman
conquest of the South of Italy that created the lack of 'social capital'
in the region, the dearth of associational life that led to a society
that lacked trust or the ability to cooperate. Yet the Normans also
colonised England and that led to a society which gave birth to the
industrial revolution. Thus Norman colonisation had heterogeneous
effects too. [Colonialism mattered for development because it shaped the
institutions of different societies]{.underline}. But many other things
influenced these too, and, at least in the early modern and modern
period, there were quite a few places that managed to avoid colonialism.
These include China, Iran, Japan, Nepal and Thailand, amongst others,
and there is a great deal of variation in development outcomes within
these countries, not to mention the great variation within Europe
itself. This raises the question of how important, quantitatively,
European colonialism was, compared to other factors. Acemoglu et al.
(2001) calculate that, according to their estimates, differences in
economic institutions account for about two-thirds of the differences in
income per-capita in the world. At the same time, [Acemoglu]{.underline}
et al. (2002) [show that, on their own, historical settler mortality and
indigenous population density in 1500 explain around 30% of the
variation in economic institutions in the world today. **If historical
urbanisation in 1500, which can also explain variation in the nature of
colonial societies, is added, this increases to over 50% of the
variation**]{.underline}. [If this is right, then a third of income
inequality in the world today can be explained by the varying impact of
European colonialism on different societies. A big deal.]{.underline}
[That colonialism shaped the historical institutions of colonies might
be obviously plausible]{.underline}. For example, we know that, in Peru
of the 1570s, the Spanish Viceroy Francisco de Toledo set up a huge
system of forced labour to mine the silver of Potosí. But this system,
the Potosí mita, was abolished in the 1820s, when Peru and Bolivia
became independent. To claim that such an institution, or, more broadly,
the institutions created by colonial powers all over the world,
influence development today, is to make a claim about how colonialism
influenced the political economy of these societies in a way which led
these institutions to either directly persist, or to leave a path
dependent legacy. The coerced labour of indigenous peoples lasted
directly up until at least the 1952 Bolivian Revolution, when the system
known as pongueaje was abolished. More generally, Acemoglu and Robinson
(2012, Chapters 11 and 12) and Dell (2010) discuss many mechanisms via
which this could have taken place. Finally, it is worth observing that
our empirical findings have important implications for alterative
theories of comparative development. Some argue that geographical
differences are dominant in explaining long-run patterns of development.
In contradistinction, we showed that [once the role of institutions is
accounted for, geographical factors are not correlated with development
outcomes.]{.underline} The fact that, for instance, there is a
correlation between latitude and geography, is not indicative of a
causal relationship. [It is simply driven by the fact that European
colonialism created a pattern of institutions that is correlated with
latitude.]{.underline} Once this is controlled for, geographical
variables play no causal role. Others argue that cultural differences
are paramount in driving development. [We found no role at all for
cultural differences measured in several ways. First, the religious
composition of different populations.]{.underline} [Second, as we have
emphasised, the identity of the colonial power]{.underline}. [Third, the
fraction of the population of a country of European
descent]{.underline}. It is true, of course, that the United States and
Canada filled up with Europeans, but in our argument this was an outcome
of the fact that they had good institutions. It is not the numerical
dominance of people of European descent today that drives development.

### Heteropatriarchy

#### Settler colonialism is the root of the heteropatriarchy

U.S. Settler Colonialism as a Race-Gender Project: Development of
National Identity and Normalization of Gendered Whiteness

In this section, I describe [U.S. settler colonialism]{.underline} as a
race-gender project. By that I mean that it [transplanted certain
racialized and gendered conceptions and regimes from the metropole but
also transformed them in the context of and experiences in the New
World. What emerged out of the settler colonial project was a racialized
and gendered national identity that normalized male whiteness. Since
settlers initially were exogenous others seeking to claim rights to land
and sovereignty over those who already occupied the land, they needed to
develop conceptions of indigenous peoples as lesser beings, unworthy of
consideration. They harnessed race and gender to construct a hierarchy
of humankind. Conceiving]{.underline} of [indigenous peoples as less
than fully human justified dispossessing them and rendered them
expendable and/or invisible]{.underline}. Land occupied or used
seasonally by indigenes was conceived of as terra nullius (empty land or
land belonging to no one) and therefore available for taking by white
settlers. Simultaneously, [settlers conceived of themselves as more
advanced]{.underline} and evolved, [bringers of progress and
enlightenment to the wilderness. Masculine whiteness thus became central
to settler identity, a status closely tied to ownership of property and
political sovereignty. The latter in turn articulated with
heteropatriarchy, which rendered white manhood supreme with respect to
control over property and self-rule.]{.underline} [This
entailed]{.underline} settler [wives being denied an independent legal
identity; instead, her identity was merged into that of her husband, and
her property and labor were under his control.]{.underline} Further, it
was presumed that "[heteropatriarchal nuclear-domestic arrangements, in
which the \[white\] father is both protector and leader should serve as
the model for social arrangements of the state and its
institutions]{.underline}" (Arvin, Tuck, and Morrill 2013:13).

Settlers may initially identify with the imperial power and submit to
its rule, but over time their interactions with indigenes and
experiences in the colony set them apart from the population in the
metropole. American settlers attached their identity to the land itself,
to the mythologized common experience of settlement, and often to the
shared goal of self-government. Frontiersmen and women became symbols of
what it meant to be American. This new identity helped to bridge
differences of class, ethnicity, and nationality that might otherwise
have divided them. Thus, there was greater equality among the settlers
than existed at the time among inhabitants of the metropole. European
immigrants to the United States who moved west to take advantage of
inexpensive frontier lands were quickly granted American citizenship
rights and considered equals among their peers in matters of local
government.

Some settlers also appropriated indigenous symbols, attributes, and
skills, as in the case of American frontiersmen who wore buckskin and
cowboys, range-riders, and backwoodsmen who adopted native trapping,
hunting, and riding techniques. Turner's (\[1893\] 1920:4) essay refers
to frontiersmen discarding train travel for traveling by birch canoes,
wearing hunting shirts and moccasins, planting Indian corn, and even
shouting war cries and taking scalps in "orthodox Indian fashion." Of
course, the vast majority of white Americans did not actually ride
canoes or wear buckskin. However, they identified with fictional or
mythical characters (e.g., Leather Stockings, Paul Bunyan) or emblematic
exemplars who did (e.g., Daniel Boone, Buffalo Bill).

Walter Hixson (2013:3) characterizes the emulations of indigenes as
expressions of settler ambivalence:

The colonizer desired the colonized other, for example for his
attunement with nature or sexual liberation, and yet was repulsed by his
primitiveness and the dangers he posed. The slippages and uncertainty
with the colonizer's identity, including taking on some of the
characteristics of the "savage," produced anxiety and instability.

Importantly, the adoption of indigenous symbols and attributes
differentiates settlers from residents of the metropole, whom settlers
may scorn as "over-civilized." In the U.S. case, the appropriation of
indigenous symbols and practices contributed to the forging of a new
national identity separate from that of the metropole and supporting the
case for self-government.

Another element common to settler colonialism, one that certainly
characterizes U.S. settler colonialism, is the "denial and disavowal of
the history of violent dispossession of the indigenes" (Hixson 2013:12).
Lorenzo Veracini (2010:14) opines,

[The settler hides behind his labour and hardship]{.underline} (the
settler does not dispossess anyone; he "wrestles with the land" to
sustain his family) . . . [the settler enters a "new, empty land to
start a new life;" indigenous people naturally and inevitably "vanish;"
it is not settlers that displace them]{.underline}.

In short, "[settler colonialism obscures the conditions of its own
production."]{.underline} Veracini adds that settler colonialism's need
to disavow any foundational violence is such that "even when settler
colonial narratives celebrate anti-indigenous violence, they do so by
representing a defensive battle ensuring the continued survival of the
settler community and never as a founding violence per se" (p. 78).

[The encounter with the indigene can be viewed as the founding moment
for the formation of U.S. whiteness]{.underline}. [The]{.underline}
"savage" and [eliminable indigene is racialized as "other" in contrast
to the "civilized" sovereign settler, who becomes "white."
Whiteness]{.underline} also [becomes synonymous with the
nation.]{.underline} Aileen Moreton-Robinson (2008:85) explains,

[The USA as a White nation state cannot exist without land and clearly
defined borders, it is the legally defined and asserted territorial
sovereignty that provides the context for national identification of
Whiteness.]{.underline} In this way . . . [Native American dispossession
indelibly marks configurations of White national identity.]{.underline}

Melissa Lovell (2007:3) observes, "[Settler colonialism is an example of
an institutionalised]{.underline} or normalized (and therefore mostly
invisible) [ideology of national identity."]{.underline}
[She]{.underline} also [points to the associated invisibility and
normalization of whiteness. "White people are able to define Whiteness
as normality and to position themselves as full citizens whilst pushing
non-White people]{.underline} (including migrants and indigenous people)
to the margins or even outside of the boundaries of citizenship."

[Native American legal scholar Robert A. Williams, Jr. goes further,
attributing the establishment of a U.S. white racial dictatorship to
settler resolve to erase Indians from the land:]{.underline}

An overtly racist, hostile, and violent language of Indian savagery can
be found in the first official U.S. legal document promulgated by the
Founding Fathers, the Declaration of Independence. . . . \[This\]
racist, organizing iconography of the Indian as irreconcilable and
inassimilable savage other continued after the Revolution as one of the
core organizing beliefs inspiring the Founders' vision of America's
growth and potentiality as a new form of expansionary White racial
dictatorship in the world. (R. Williams 2005:39)

While acknowledging the centrality of enslaved blacks to the formation
of white racial identity, R. [Williams argues that the Founders' first
Indian policy "was the inaugural step in defining a White racial
identity for the United States as a nation]{.underline}" (p. 48).

#### Only a framework based on settler colonialism allows deconstruction of the race, gender, class, and sexual relations between colonizers and the colonized that persist to today

[An Alternative Starting Point]{.underline}

[I]{.underline} now [turn to an exposition of settler colonialism as an
alternative starting point for a framework that can generate a more
historically and structurally grounded analysis of racial inequality in
the United States, one that pays attention to variation]{.underline}
across time and place [while also being attentive to structures that
link]{.underline} these [differing cases. It is a framework that is
amenable to intersectional understanding because it is widely understood
that colonial projects simultaneously structure race, gender, class, and
sexual relations within and between colonists and the
colonized.]{.underline} Moreover, since [settler colonial projects are
transnational in scope, a settler colonialism framework invites
investigation of cross-national connections and
comparisons.]{.underline}

[The concept of settler colonialism has been]{.underline} most clearly
[elaborated by scholars of indigenous studies]{.underline}, especially
in Australia, Canada, and the United States. [It is a framework that
highlights commonalities in the history and contemporary situation of
indigenous peoples in many parts of the world]{.underline}. However,
although it may seem to be best suited to explain the racialization and
treatment of indigenous peoples, I agree with Patrick Wolfe (1999) that
[settler colonialism should be seen not as an event but as an ongoing
structure. The logic, tenets, and identities engendered by settler
colonialism persist and continue to shape race, gender, class, and
sexual formations into the present.]{.underline}

#### Strategies predicated upon modern ideals of progress, worth, and property inevitably replicate settler structures -- only re-analyzing settler colonialism as a transnational political and economic structure allows us to undo the race and gender relations formed by settler thinking

In this article [I argue for the necessity of a settler colonialism
framework for an]{.underline} historically grounded and [inclusive
analysis of U.S. race and gender formation. A settler colonialism
framework can encompass the specificities of racisms and sexisms
affecting different racialized groups---especially Native Americans,
blacks, Latinos, and Asian Americans---while]{.underline} also
[highlighting structural and cultural factors that undergird and link
these racisms and sexisms.]{.underline} I offer here a first rough
sketch of a settler colonialism--framed analysis of racial formation in
certain critical periods and places in the United States. [I engage
with]{.underline} recent [theoretical work that views settler
colonialism as a distinct transnational formation whose political and
economic projects have shaped and continue to shape race relations in
first world nations that were established through settler
colonialism]{.underline}. [My aim is to avoid lumping all racisms
together, even for the benign purpose of promoting cross-race alliances
to fight racial injustice. Equally, I wish to avoid seeing racisms
affecting various groups as completely separate and
unrelated.]{.underline} Rather[, I endeavor to uncover]{.underline} some
of the [articulations among different racisms that would suggest more
effective bases for cross-group alliances.]{.underline}

In the latter regard, [one implication of taking settler colonialism
seriously is to advance decolonization as a necessary goal in the quest
to achieve race and gender justice. Indeed, the elaboration of the
settler colonialism framework has been closely paralleled by the
development of decolonial critiques of racial justice projects that aim
to achieve liberal inclusion, rather than liberation, of subordinated
groups.]{.underline} Theorists of decolonialism, such as Walter
[Mignolo]{.underline} (2007) [and Nelson Maldonado-Torres]{.underline}
(2011), [argue that]{.underline} the case for [liberal inclusion
can]{.underline} only [be made by working within the narratives, logics,
and epistemologies of modernism]{.underline}. Yet, [these are the very
narratives, logics, and epistemologies that undergird settler colonial
projects. Thus, strategies and solutions that adhere to modernist
concepts of progress, individuality, property, worth, and so on are
fated to reproduce the inequalities that colonialism has created.
Mignolo and Maldonado-Torres argue for the necessity of challenging and
rejecting modernist concepts.]{.underline} They propose that [the border
thinking and philosophy of women of color feminists offer
counter-hegemonic narratives, logics, and epistemologies that enable the
imagining of liberation for men and women of color]{.underline}. What I
draw on from decolonial theory is an intersectional perspective, one
that recognizes gender, sexuality, and race as co-constituted by settler
colonial projects.

### Middle East Conflict / Intervention

#### The Indian Country is present day Middle East to pursue its battle against "Savagery" Therefore, to return to Indian Country is to return victorious in legacy. Referring to hostile enemy territory as Indian Country underwrites the necessity and value of fighting in it for a greater good.

**Silliman '08---**Stephen W. Silliman is a professor of Anthropology at
the University of Massachusetts Boston. (June 2008, "The \"Old West\" in
the Middle East: U.S. Military Metaphors in Real and Imagined Indian
Country",
<https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1548-1433.2008.00029.x>
//RC)

[The \"Indian Country\" metaphor entails a series of analogical links
between Native Americans and Iraqis and their lands under military siege
by the U.S. military.]{.underline} George Lakoff and Mark Johnson\'s
(1980) terminology of mapping \"source\" and \"target\" domains helps
draw out the connections. The source domain is North **[American
Indigenous people living in what the United States called \"Indian
Country]{.underline}**\"? the lawless frontier of advancing civilization
in the 19th century? [as]{.underline} dark-skinned [savages with little
technological development, no adherence to Christianity, warring tribes
and factions, land that should be turned over to more appropriate
governance and use, and knack for guerilla fighting in a war that they
did not (could not?) win.]{.underline} The discourse by soldiers and
officers readily maps these characteristics onto the target domain of
Iraq. Iraqis can be and often are portrayed in all of these same ways in
military and civilian discourse. The efficacy of [this metaphor
relies]{.underline} not in the accuracy of the historical or cultural
details in the source domain (for these are terribly inaccurate, racist,
and stereotypical), but [on the believability and acceptability of them
**as part of a narrative of conquest and nation-building by some of its
citizens**.]{.underline} The refraction of this narrative through
Hollywood and the cinema genre of \"Westerns\" must be acknowledged as
well. Equally important to the parallels are the presumed constants in
both source and target domains: the U.S. military and reasons for war.
Those who use the \"Indian Country\" metaphor do so because they feel
historical, cultural, and national kinship with soldiers who similarly
waged wars of pacification against unruly adversaries who could be
subjugated with appropriate force. In both cases, [whether battling
Indians in the 19th century or Iraqis in the 21st century, the U.S.
military discourse attempts to convey civilization\'s battle against
savagery, a discourse]{.underline} that Robert Ivie notes [has been
\"deeply rooted in the American political lexicon, its culture and
colletive psyche\"]{.underline} (2005:56) since the American Revolution
in the late 1700s. Similarly, Tom Engelhardt notes that [\"the paradigm
of the frontier and of the Indians Wars settled deep into the American
soul \... and the framework of the Indian Wars, however suppressed and
transformed, remains in some fashion powerfully with us]{.underline}\"
(2007:315). Heritage serves to install a widely accepted and unambiguous
past? whether as event, interpretation, feeling, or personal qualities?
into the present for the purpose of taking action or finding meaning
(Lowenthal 1996). **[A powerful feature of heritage is not simply that
it provides a static view of the past and its values for today, but that
each performance of heritage does not remake the past but, rather, the
story we tell about it.]{.underline}** Therefore,
[metaphors]{.underline} do not simply draw on a past assumed to be
immutable and factual; they also [serve as mechanisms for reinscribing
and updating it as heritage in arenas of social and political
power.]{.underline} Calling a current context by a past referent, such
as \"Indian Country,\" serves to draw on a presumed collective memory at
the same time that it contributes to memory making today. [The power
lies in the fact that no one needs to explain \"Indian Country\" to U.S.
soldiers who use or hear it,]{.underline} even if such individuals might
well fail an \"objective\" history test about that history. The metaphor
is emotive and presumably transparent. **[Referring to \"enemy
territory\" in Middle East as \"Indian Country\" works in all of these
registers. It asks soldiers to draw on their collective, national memory
to remember that U.S. military forces have faced such situations before
and to think about doing what their predecessors might have
done.]{.underline}** Therefore, the past is a training ground that \"the
military\" has already explored. New experiences for individuals take on
familiarity from the repertoire of supposedly shared, collective
historical experiences. **[The metaphor also renarrates the past through
the filter of the present to provide the common link. An individual does
not merely collectively remember and commemorate the past through
performance but, rather, vicariously experiences the present as though
it were also the past.]{.underline}** Could a U.S. soldier who has
fought in contemporary \"Indian Country\" in Iraq read a historical
account of the Battle of Little Bighorn without assuming that he or she
might know what that past must have been like? The assumed constancy of
the U.S. military between source and target domain suggests not.
However, the terminology also serves to make the outcome of conflict in
\"Indian Country\" predictable and, therefore, more acceptable. U.S.
military personnel know? whether they played the role of cowboys or
Indians when they were children or slept through history class? that
**[the Indians might have won a battle but they never won the
war.]{.underline}** Transforming Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong
Custer and his Seventh Cavalry\'s absolute defeat in 1876 by Northern
Cheyenne, Lakota, and Arapaho at the Bat tle of Little Bighorn in
Montana into the ultimate hero sacrifice for Manifest Destiny happened
almost immediately after the battle and still military memory today
(Elliott 2007). [**Therefore, to return to Indian Country, this time in
the Middle East, is to return victorious, because history has already
established this legacy. Referring to hostile enemy territory as Indian
Country underwrites the necessity and value of fighting in it for a
greater good**. The sacrifice of U.S. soldiers then can be rationalized
as acceptable means to an otherwise \"noble\" and predictable end, as
can the loss of]{.underline} Iraqi [civilians, including men, women, and
children.]{.underline}

#### The externalized threat to the Settler will always be the Native but perceived in numerous forms, one of them being a Terrorist in the Middle East to justify its interventionist policies in the name of national security.

[Conflating Indian Country real and imagined, past and present, sets the
stage for a dangerous symbolic inversion when the simile \"Iraq is like
Indian Country\" transforms into \"Indian Country is like Iraq\" (or
\"Indians are like Iraqis\"). The past is recast in the present, not
only to confirm the assumptions about the present but also to insure
that the past fits the expected mold. Referring to the Middle East
battlegrounds of the U.S. \"global war on terror\" as \"Indian Country\"
means, quite simply, that Indians must have been]{.underline} ([and
still are]{.underline}?) [terrorists]{.underline}. A Native American
writer recently worried: My immediate thoughts? the first time that I
heard the reference to the war torn streets of Baghdad as \"Indian
Country\"? was that after 515 years of conquest? **[in the minds of
Imperial America? the First Nations of the \"Americas\" are still
regarded as enemies, hostiles, obstacles to progress \... as
terrorists.]{.underline}** \[Starr 2007\] Even if the rendering of
terrorist and infidel zones in the [Middle East as \"Indian Country\"
serves more as historical metaphor, and even if soldiers would not
consider their Native American neighbors or fellow soldiers today as
terrorists, one still cannot escape **the problematic renarration** of
those historical Indian Wars as conflicts with terrorists, despite the
obvious common thread of the **United States as the
invader.**]{.underline} It takes little imagination to create the
metaphor\'s in version when some purveyors spell it out quite clearly.
Kaplan makes the following observation that explicitly links past Native
Americans with terrorism and radicalism: Colombian narco-terrorists had
forged strategic link with radical Islamists: proof that while the
frontier of Indian Country used to begin eight miles west of Fort
Leavenworth? where the Santa Fe and Oregon trails separated? it now
circumscribed the earth, and was not confined to the Middle East.
\[Kaplan 2005:43\] [This comparison is possible, in part, because of his
characterization of \"Indian Country\" in the 19th-century United States
as \"a Hobbesian world\" with \"throwbacks,\" a \"panoply of mobile
guerilla forces,\" and the equivalent of \"warring ethnic and religious
militias\"]{.underline} (Kaplan 2005: 8-9). In a similar vein, [a
\"senior U.S. official\" referred to the search for Osama bin Laden in
the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States by
saying that \"we don\'t see any of his Indians doing anything on his
behalf\"]{.underline} (Scarborough 2002: A01). In the clearest
association between Indians and terrorists, Kaplan calls the Battle of
Little Bighorn in 1876 and \"the massacre of Custer\'s 7th cavalry? the
9/11 of its day\" (2005:367). [Not much reading between the lines in
this discourse is necessary to realize that Native Americans who fought
to keep their homelands against aggressive U.S. military encroachments
now have become terrorists who caused un expected heavy casualties
without provocation]{.underline}. How can an 1870s victory in battle by
Native Americans against a regiment of the U.S. Cavalry? led by an
aggressive Custer who was coming to force them onto reservations and to
help prepare the land for White settlement and mineral extraction? be
likened to the heavy civilian casualties suffered by U.S. and world
citizens in the surprise attack orchestrated by al-Qaeda on the Twin
Towers in New York City in 2001? It cannot. [Suggesting]{.underline}
otherwise [involves]{.underline} (1) a misrepresentation of well-known
U.S. history (one that is, in fact, commemorated by the U.S. National
Park Service at the Little Bighorn battlefield with monuments to
soldiers and monuments to Native American warriors and their bravery
\[see Elliott 2007\]); (2) [an attempt to instill fear by fabricating a
threat of terrorism and savagery that, by extension, must have affected
the United States since at least the 1870s and continues to require
vigilance]{.underline} (per Ivie 2005); and (3) a complete disregard for
the cultural and political casualties for Native Americans caused by
such a flawed comparison. [More than history is at stake]{.underline}.
[The \"Indian Country\" metaphor also represents the language of
colonization in the present. Summoning this kind of metaphor for a
military effort in the Middle East conveys that the occupying troops are
agents of colonization, imperialism, and the presumed highest orders of
civilization.]{.underline} [As a result, the military speaks of \"Indian
Country\" as a place to dominate and control, not as the homelands of
some of its current enlisted men and women who frequently serve their
country in percentages higher than in the overall U.S. population. What
must it be like as a Native American soldier to hear a phrase that means
one\'s homeland being used to refer to a hostile and dangerous place
that needs to be conquered and subdued?]{.underline} What are the
implications of knowing that fellow soldiers are playing the proverbial
cowboy? What dimensions are invoked when Native American visitors, such
as the Native Star Dance Team from New Mexico headed by retired Army
Sgt. First Class Nick Brokeshoul der (Hopi-Shawnee), perform for
soldiers in Iraq (see Figure 1)? [How are these representatives of real
Indian Country discursively and practically reconciled with references
to imagined Indian Country in war zones]{.underline}? The same question
can be posed for the U.S. Department of Defense\'s November 2006
celebration of American Indian Heritage month that honored Native
American service in the U.S. military, past and present (U.S. Department
of Defense 2006). Can one-time, mandated, positive commemorations
subvert the dominant, multisided, spontaneous, negative language of
military war zones directed at Native American people and their
ancestry? Further ethnographic research will be required to provide
answers.

#### The AFF's pre-conceived interests in the Middle East perpetuates how the "East" is perceived has always signified danger and threat during this period, even as it has meant the traditional Orient as well as Russia.

https://www.rarebooksocietyofindia.org/book_archive/196174216674_10154888789381675.pdf
//RC)

The three long chapters and twelve shorter units into which this book is
divided are intended to facilitate exposition as much as possible.
Chapter One, "The Scope of Orientalism," draws a large circle around all
the dimensions of the subject, both in terms of historical time and
experiences and in terms of philosophical and political themes. Chapter
Two, "Orientalist Structures and Restructures," attempts to trace the
development of modern Orientalism by a broadly chronological
description, and also by the description of a set of devices common to
the work of important poets, artists, and scholars. Chapter Three,
"Orientalism Now," begins where its predecessor left off, at around
1870. This is the period of great colonial expansion into the Orient,
and it culminates in World War II. The very last section of Chapter
Three characterizes the shift from British and French to American
hegemony; I attempt there finally to sketch the present intellectual and
social realities of Orientalism in the United States. 3. The personal
dimension. In the Prison Notebooks Gramsci says: ["The starting-point of
critical elaboration is the consciousness of what one really is and is
\`knowing thyself' as a product of the historical process to date, which
has deposited in you an infinity of traces, without leaving an
inventory."]{.underline} The only available English translation
inexplicably leaves Gramsci's comment at that, whereas is fact Gramsci's
Italian text concludes by adding, "[therefore it is imperative at the
outset to compile such an inventory."]{.underline}16 Much of the
personal investment in this study derives from my awareness of being an
"Oriental" as a child growing up in two British colonies. All of my
education, in those colonies (Palestine and Egypt) and in the United
States, has been Western, and yet that deep early awareness has
persisted. In many ways my study of Orientalism has been an attempt to
inventory the traces upon me, the Oriental subject, of the culture whose
domination has been so powerful a factor in the life of all Orientals.
This is why for me the Islamic Orient has had to be the center of
attention. Whether what I have achieved is the inventory prescribed by
Gramsci is not for me to judge, although I have felt it important to be
conscious of trying to produce one. Along the way, as severely and as
rationally as I have been able, I have tried to maintain a critical
consciousness, as well as employing those instruments of historical,
humanistic, and cultural research of which my education has made me the
fortunate beneficiary. In none of that, however, have I ever lost hold
of the cultural reality of, the personal involvement in having been
constituted as, "an Oriental." The historical circumstances making such
a study possible are fairly complex, and I can only list them
schematically here. [Anyone resident in the West since the 1950s,
particularly in the United States, will have lived through an era of
extraordinary turbulence in the relations of East and West. No one will
have failed to note how "East" has always signified danger and threat
during this period, even as it has meant the traditional Orient as well
as Russia]{.underline}. In the universities a growing establishment of
area-studies programs and institutes has made the scholarly study of the
Orient a branch of national policy. Public affairs in this country
include a healthy interest in the Orient, as much for its strategic and
economic importance as for its traditional exoticism. [If the world has
become immediately accessible to a Western citizen living in the
electronic age, the Orient too has drawn nearer to him, and is now less
a myth perhaps than a place crisscrossed by Western, especially
American, interests. One aspect of the electronic, postmodern world is
that there has been a reinforcement of the stereotypes by which the
Orient is viewed. Television, the films, and all the media's resources
have forced information into more and more standardized
molds.]{.underline} [So far as the Orient is concerned, standardization
and cultural stereotyping have intensified the hold of the
nineteenth-century academic and imaginative demonology of "the
mysterious Orient." This is nowhere truer than in the ways by which the
Near East is grasped.]{.underline} Three things have contributed to
making even the simplest perception of the Arabs and Islam into a highly
politicized, almost raucous matter: one, the history of popular
anti-Arab and anti-Islamic prejudice in the West, which is immediately
reflected in the history of Orientalism; two, the struggle between the
Arabs and Israeli Zionism, and its effects upon American Jews as well as
upon both the liberal culture and the population at large; three, the
almost total absence of any cultural position making it possible either
to identify with or dispassionately to discuss the Arabs or Islam.
[Furthermore, it hardly needs saying that because the Middle East is now
so identified with Great Power politics, oil economics, and the
simple-minded dichotomy of freedom-loving, democratic Israel and evil,
totalitarian, and terroristic Arabs, the chances of anything like a
clear view of what one talks about in talking about the Near East are
depressingly small.]{.underline} My own experiences of these matters are
in part what made me write this book. The life of an Arab Palestinian in
the West, particularly in America, is disheartening. There exists here
an almost unanimous consensus that politically he does not exist, and
when it is allowed that he does, it is either as a nuisance or as an
Oriental. [The web of racism, cultural stereotypes, political
imperialism, dehumanizing ideology holding in the Arab or the Muslim is
very strong indeed,]{.underline} and it is this web which every
Palestinian has come to feel as his uniquely punishing destiny. [It has
made matters worse for him to remark that no person academically
involved with the Near East- no Orientalist, that is-has ever in the
United States culturally and politically identified himself
wholeheartedly with the Arabs; certainly there have been identifications
on some level, but they have never taken an "acceptable" form as has
liberal American identification with Zionism, and all too frequently
they have been radically flawed by their association either with
discredited political and economic interests (oil company and State
Department Arabists, for example) or with religion.]{.underline}

## Alternatives

### Abolition

#### The alternative is to burn down the state -- only by engaging in an unquestioning and profound social revolution of refusing the state can we create the conditions necessary 

**KatherineKellyAbraham 18** (KatherineKellyAbraham. "Burn it Down:
Abolition, Insurgent Political Praxis, and the Destruction of Decency,"
Abolition: A Journal of Insurgent Politics 1, no. 2 (2018). The authors
use a collective name of KatherineKellyAbraham. The listing of the names
does not reflect a hierarchical order of any sort, and their names can
be shifted around. They like the idea of playing with citation
practices. The authors can be contacted at:
<burnitdown.abolition@gmail.com>.) //bc

This journal calls for abolition, a call implicitly asserting that
contemporary sociopolitical and economic institutions are inherently
unfixable and beyond resuscitation, reform, or rescue. **[The fantasy of
radically changing political structures from within is simply not a
viable political option for those concerned with the ultimate
destruction of the mechanisms of carnage that shape modern life and its
attendant regimes of governance,]{.underline}** [such as: the global war
machine, the prison industrial complex, transnational resource
extraction, and the national sacrifice areas]{.underline} (Ortiz 1992)
[generated in the wake of these lethal socioeconomic configurations and
expressions of empire]{.underline}.\[i\] Rather than drawing from these
regimes of death for social and legal recognition, power, and
welfare---what we broadly refer to as the "state"---[consider what it
would mean to the modern ordering of life to utterly destroy the state,
to refuse its seductions and ruses of power, to incinerate it until
nothing remains but ash? Our imperative to "burn it down" draws from a
rich tradition of scholarship that positions the state as a technique,
practice, and effect of modern governance and its optimization,
rationalization, and normalization]{.underline}. Following Timothy
Mitchell, we define the state as a "network of institutional mechanisms
through which a certain social and political order is maintained"
(Mitchell 2006, 175). In the words of Michel Foucault, the state
functions as "a schema of intelligibility for a whole set of already
established institutions, a whole set of given realities" (Foucault
2004, 286). As a schematic and reality, we perceive the state as
providing a legible matrix for the parameters of self-management and
self-conduct: for social and political order. As Achille Mbembe
insists[, the adoption of state or sovereign power is "a twofold process
of self-institution and self-limitation]{.underline}" (Mbembe 2003, 13).
Attendant to the important critiques made by Fanon, we argue that [this
twofold process remains shaped by Euro-American colonial mores at the
"objective as well as subjective level" of experience and
perception]{.underline} (Fanon 2008, xv). That is to say, we understand
state power as generative of inherently colonial relations of rule:
relations that produce contemporary sociopolitical, juridical, and
affective orientations, sensibilities, and subjectivities.\[ii\] As Glen
Sean Coulthard argues, "[colonial relations of power are no longer
reproduced primarily through overtly coercive means, but rather through
the asymmetrical exchange of mediated forms of state recognition and
accommodation"]{.underline} (Coulthard 2014, 15). We add that the state
accomplishes this mediation vis-à-vis the internalized politics of
decency: an argument to which we shortly return. [**The project of this
piece is not to think about how to make life more livable under current
regimes of power or to ponder building something new or altered in the
state's place**.]{.underline} Rather, [**we imagine alternative worlds
based in the total abolition of these regimes** because of their
astonishingly responsive capabilities, **which render profound social
transformation impossible**]{.underline}. [The state successfully
incorporates its margins and continually extends its representation in
order to further its grasp on the body politic]{.underline} (for
instance, the inclusion of women in combat roles or the Supreme Court
ruling on same sex marriage). [Simultaneously]{.underline}, and without
coincidence, [the state manipulates its boundaries through violent forms
of capital accumulation and proxy wars]{.underline}, [marks borders with
fences and deportations, and uses its streets as a costly theater for
subjects that deviate from its aims]{.underline}. However, [the
fundamentally lethal interests of state power have not changed since the
European invasion of the Americas]{.underline}. Instead, [global
technologies of communication]{.underline} and visibility [have forced
the state to pivot]{.underline}, creating the illusion of a more
transparent, democratic, and equal society. Nonetheless, the state
relies on fantasies of "individual" participation (civil rights, voting,
recognition, and protest) as much as it relies on its authoritarian
power to revoke those fantasies without notice or recourse. As the
violences executed by the state continue to shape everyday life in this
country[, we believe that it is by no means extreme to posit that one
solution to these ills is to destroy---to burn down---contemporary
institutions of governance, policing, and comfort, to cooperatively
dismantle the workings of the state]{.underline}. For us, **[a radical
project of abolition and insurgent political praxis refuses to negotiate
with the state, or seek recognition from any of its bureaucratic
apparatuses]{.underline}**, [in order to secure the small-scale
concessions that only colonize and quell resistance]{.underline}.
**[Political]{.underline}** **[projects of compromise with the state
have proven insufficient]{.underline}**---[especially in addressing
everyday violence, such as police brutality, that continues to erupt
unchecked in the face of mainstream "social justice"
organizing]{.underline}. Ultimately, [this organizing and activism
treats the state as a central means of stopping the very political
violence that insures its core function, operation, and
maintenance.]{.underline}

### Critical Place Inquiry

#### Vote negative to embrace critical place inquiry -- organizing around indigenous social and political theory, which prioritizes land relations that are key to solve for extractive environmental practices - the permutation homogenizes the alternative, which corrupts the transformative potential of the alternative.

**Tuck and Mckenzie 15** Eve is an award winning scholar in field of
Indigenous studies and educational research \["Relational Validity and
the "Where" of inquiry: Place and Land in Qualitative Research"}//Mberhe

A final explanation for this tendency comes from theorizations of
settler colonialism. [Settler colonialism is a form of colonialism in
which outsiders come to make a new home on the land that is already
inhabited by other humans.]{.underline} In this form of colonialism, [it
is land/place, that is the ultimate pursuit,]{.underline} rather than
extractions (spices, gold, or labor) as in other forms of colonialism.
[Settler societies are designed to not consider place---to do so would
require consideration of genocide (]{.underline}Grande, 2004). [Settler
societies are based on ongoing displacement and dispossession of people
in relation to land. Theorizations of settler colonialism expose deep
behaviors of ignorance toward land]{.underline}, water, [environment,
and sustainability, as evidenced in fuel extractions, agricultural
practices, pollution and toxic dumping, hyper-development, and water
use.]{.underline} Turning toward place necessitates acknowledgment and
reparations based on these histories: of settler colonialism,
capitalism, and of Cartesian and (post)modern separations of mind from
body, body from land. As humans make our planet increasingly toxic,
unlivable, and at the same time increasingly inequitable, at what point
might these cleavages be sewn back together, might we account for our
pasts and to future generations? Are we capable of "post carbon social
theories" of place (Elliott & Urry, 2010) that address ongoing
obsessions with expansion and capitalism; more, are we capable of living
post carbon social lives? We believe that [theorizing and practicing
place more deeply is at least a step in the direction of such a path. To
this end, we have worked over the past several years to describe
critical place inquiry, a set of concepts, practices, and theories which
move beyond understandings of place as a neutral backdrop, or as a
bounded and antiquated concept, or as only a physical landscape.
Critical place inquiry can involve and include a range of research
methodologies and methods (outlined in full in Tuck & McKenzie, 2015);
what is central is the way the chosen methodology and methods engage
place explicitly and politically. Critical place inquiry:]{.underline}
•• [understands places as]{.underline} themselves [mobile, shifting over
time and space and through interactions with flows of people, other
species, social practices]{.underline}; •• entails, at a more localized
level, understanding places as both influencing social practices as well
as being performed and (re)shaped through practices and movements of
individuals and collectives; •• conceptualizes place as interactive and
dynamic due to these time--space characteristics; •• recognizes that
disparate realities determine not only how place is experienced but also
how it is understood and practiced in turn (e.g., in relation to
culture, geography, gender, race, sexuality, age, or other
identifications and experiences); •• **[addresses spatialized and
place-based processes of colonization and settler colonialism, and works
against their forgone-ness or naturalization through social science
research]{.underline}**; •• **[extends beyond considerations of the
social to more deeply consider the land itself and its non-human
inhabitants and characteristics as they determine and manifest
place]{.underline}**; •• aims to further generative and critical
politics of places through such [conceptualizations/practices and via a
relational ethics of accountability to people and place;]{.underline} ••
takes seriously the conceptual and empirical contributions of Indigenous
epistemologies of land. In recent years, important moves have been made
to critique the gaps between critical approaches and Indigenous
approaches to knowing and research (Grande, 2004; L. T. Smith, 2012) and
to bridge those gaps, at least by placing Indigenous theories alongside
critical theories and methodologies (Denzin, Lincoln, & Smith, 2008).
The critical intellectual tradition has not always been accountable to
Indigenous peoples (Grande, 2004). Often, the social justice projects of
the critical intellectual tradition compete with Indigenous justice
projects related to sovereignty and decolonization (Grande, 2004; Tuck &
Yang, 2012), and much of critical theory remains unresponsive to the
critiques raised by Indigenous scholars (see Grande, 2004; Tuck & Fine,
2007; Tuck & Gaztambide-Fernández, 2013, for more discussion on this).
**[Our framing of critical place]{.underline}** **[inquiry puts
Indigenous theories, methodologies, and methods at the center, not on
the periphery. It does this not by simply pasting on Indigenous work, as
is often done in liberal multicultural discourse. Instead, it engages
Indigenous work on its own terms, in adherence to its own commitments
and conditions. A task of critical place inquiry is to organize itself
around commitments to Indigenous social and political theory---including
Indigenous sovereignty, refusal, and the non-abstraction of land---not
as peripheral points or extra considerations, but as foundational to its
praxis.]{.underline}**

### Decolonization

#### The alternative is decolonization and indigenous self-sovereignty -- this involves a severing of the colonial relationship and a fundamental redistribution of power. Institutionalization of indigenous rights ultimately fails -- it prioritizes the interests of the states over those of the colonized

**Short 2005** (Damien Short (2005) Reconciliation and the Problem of
Internal Colonialism, Journal of Intercultural Studies, 26:3, 267-282,
DOI: 10.1080/07256860500153534. Damien Short is a Senior Lecturer in
Human Rights Convenor, MA Understanding and Securing Human Rights
Institute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London, UK) //bc

Applying Frazer's general observation to the case of indigenous peoples
produces the following position: [genuine 'recognition' of indigenous
peoples]{.underline} (colonised without consent) **[must involve a
redistribution of both political power and resources]{.underline}**,
**[which terminates not only their economic and social subordination but
also the colonial relationship itself.]{.underline}** Indeed, as
Gilbert, Alfred and Tully have suggested, [to truly address colonial
injustice recognition debates over political and economic restructuring
must not assume the legitimacy of settler state sovereignty over
indigenous peoples]{.underline}. [Without a fundamental questioning of
the assumptions underpinning the state's approach to power]{.underline},
**[the counterfactual assumptions of colonialism will continue to
structure the relationship between the state and indigenous
peoples]{.underline}** (Alfred 1999: 57[). Within this framework, any
progress made towards justice will be marginal;]{.underline} **[in fact,
it will be tolerated by the state only to the extent that it
serves]{.underline}**, or at least does not oppose, **[the interests of
the state itself]{.underline}** (ibid.). To meet the indigenous
sovereignty challenge and decolonise the relationship, [indigenous
peoples must be recognised as distinct political entities with sovereign
political rights to the lands they have occupied prior to colonisation
and treated as nations equal in status to the settler stat]{.underline}e
(see Tully 2000: 53). **[Such recognition of equal status must go beyond
settler state granted rights grounded in the politics of
difference]{.underline}**. Recent sociological investigations have shown
that [when settler states legislate to 'protect' indigenous
peoples]{.underline}, via the pseudo-liberal notion of 'group' rights,
the usual outcome is a prioritisation of commercial interests at the
expense of indigenous interests (see Short 2003b; Samson 2001).
Invariably [the result is legalisation that severely limits indigenous
rights behind a veneer of agrarian reform.]{.underline} The lesson of
such sociological analysis is that the institutionalisation of rights is
a social process, involving power, and should be analysed as such and
not assumed to be beneficial (Freeman 2002: 85). Indeed, [the
institutionalisation of rights may lead, not to their more secure
protection but to their protection in a form that is less threatening to
the existing system of powe]{.underline}r (ibid.).

### Disorientation

#### The affirmative operates through the scope of settler common sense -- perpetuating logics of elimination by taking for granted the day-to-day structures of settlerism via legislation -- prefer disorientation -- a process of absolute severance from parasitic attachments to settlement -- this makes room for indigenous sovereignty 

**Rifkin, 13.** \[Mark Rifkin, Ph.D. from The University of Pennsylvania
and a Professor, University of North Carolina at Greensboro. 09-13-2013.
"Settler common sense" (Settler Colonial Studies), 3:3-04, pp.
322-340.\]//pacc

As opposed to the sense of withdrawal into a space divorced from
contemporary political economy, the text also proposes a reframing of
perspective, altering the physical sense of relation to one's
surroundings via a suspension of their givenness. In this vein, Ahmed
suggests, ["If orientation is about making the strange familiar through
the extension of bodies into space, then disorientation occurs when that
extension fails"]{.underline} (11). These moments in the text suggest
how [the self can become the site for an imaginative break with routine
that produces a sensuous reorientation]{.underline} (getting "turned
round"). The critical project of the text appears here less as locating
a space apart in which to discover the fullness of the self than as [the
**making alien of an already occupied place**, such that "we should not
recognize" it. The act of]{.underline} turning round, of [shifting one's
orientation and redirecting the momentum by which one previously was
impelled, **offers possibilities for perceiving differently**, for
seeing and engaging **in ways that less take for granted the
jurisdictional matrix of the state**]{.underline} and in which
contemporary Native peoples can be acknowledged as themselves important
"inhabitants of New England" whose indigeneity compels a
reconceptualization of the terms of occupancy for everyone. [**Becoming
conscious of the everyday enactment of settlement involves relinquishing
the notion of an autonomous, extra-political selfhood** existing in a
place apart, instead opening onto a recognition not only of enduring
Native presence within contemporary political economy but of the effaced
history of imperial superintendence and displacement that provides the
continuing condition of possibility for the sense of settler escape into
the wilderness.]{.underline} To be clear, the absence of a declared set
of imperial commitments does not suggest non-Natives' exoneration from
continuing histories of violence perpetrated and perpetuated by the
settler-state. Returning from a different direction to Nicoll's critique
discussed earlier, there may be an absence of sentiments hostile to
Native peoples in non-Natives' speech or writing, or [nonNatives may
adopt a particular viewpoint supportive of Indigenous sovereignty on
delimited plots of land when considering Native peoples as
such.]{.underline} However, [that **absence of malice or declaration of
support does not address the ways quotidian experiences of
space**]{.underline} (with respect to jurisdiction, occupancy, and
ownership) **[and subjectivity]{.underline}** (as modular,
self-identical, and extralegal[) affectively register and **iterate
settler sovereignty** in ways that shape the generation of]{.underline},
for example, ethics, ideals, and [political projects that do not take
Native nations, voices, and lands as their direct object.]{.underline}
While arguments about the structural quality of settler colonialism --
its scale, density, duration, and centrality to US life -- remain
important, their very insistence on its pervasive and systemic operation
can create the impression of an integrated whole. However, as Latour
observes, if "the body politic" is taken "to be virtual, total, and
always already there", then "the practical means to compose it are no
longer traceable; if it's total, the practical means to totalize it are
no longer visible; if it's virtual, the practical means to realize,
visualize, and collect it have disappeared from view" (162--3). How is
the settler body politic composed, collected, and realized in everyday
ways through the experiences, perceptions, associations, emplacements,
and trajectories of non-Native bodies? [How do **settler jurisdiction
and governmentality shape the material possibilities available to
non-Natives** in scenes]{.underline} and sites apparently [disconnected
from Native peoples and Indian policy, and how do non-Natives in their
quotidian feelings and interactions]{.underline} (and the cultural
productions for which ordinary sensation serves as background)
[actualize the political and legal geographies of the
settler-state?]{.underline} [Attending to settler common sense in this
way does not]{.underline} so much [bracket Indigenous self-determination
as draw on it as ethical inspiration to **investigate the ways** it is
deferred through **ordinary action** whose aim is not such but **whose
effect is to reiterate the self-evidence of settler
geopolitics**.]{.underline} Reciprocally, such analysis also seeks to
suggest how [non-Natives might disorient and reorient themselves, how
they might come to understand not only that Indigenous peoples remain
part of the social landscape of life in the US but that the very terrain
non-Natives inhabit as given has never ceased to be a site of political
struggle.]{.underline}

### Indian Country Refusal

#### The alternative is to recognize the Indian Country metaphor as it moves across regions, through time, and provides a complex framework to explain 21^st^ century war, conflict and expansionism. A refusal of the aff's discourse, is to retell the past and see the future\--moving away from colonialist ideologies is the only way to explore how Native American narratives repeat themselves in new politics.

the University of Massachusetts Boston. (June 2008, "The \"Old West\" in
the Middle East: U.S. Military Metaphors in Real and Imagined Indian
Country",

["INDIAN COUNTRY\" is a complex metaphor. For Native Americans, it
signifies home, territory, families and friends, sacred space,
landscape, and community]{.underline}. One can hear of it from New
England to the Northwest Coast, and from the Southwest to the Dakotas.
[It denotes particularly Native spaces in the geographical and cultural
landscape of the United States, ones that may comprise ancestral
territories and reservations, refer to sacred spaces, be framed by wins
and losses in federal acknowledgment battles, and crosscut rural and
urban environments]{.underline}. Because [\"Indian Country\" is not just
one place, it is a metaphor for what it means (and where it means) to be
Native American in the contemporary United States.]{.underline} The
national newspaper, Indian Country Today, attests to the ways that
Indian people welcome and use this venue to voice news and concerns
about their current successes and struggles. Counteracting this positive
valence is the work that \"**[Indian Country\" does in another realm: as
a metaphor used by U.S. military personnel to refer to hostile,
unpacified territories in active war zones. From the Vietnam War to the
occupation of Iraq by U.S. forces beginning in 2003, the notion of
\"Indian Country\" offers a powerful heritage metaphor for the armed
forces]{.underline}**. The phrase [summons the history of Native
American and U.S. military encounters]{.underline}, particularly those
of the 19th century, [in ways that interpret the present in light of the
past, that retell (or reinterpret) the past through present political
filters, and that forecast the future while justifying the present.
**The metaphor draws on a narrative of U.S. colonialism, triumphalism,
and Othering that operated in discourses about Native Americans in the
past, that surround Native American struggles and communities today, and
that appear to be recast in new (dis)guise in the Middle East in the
early 21st century.** By exploring how the U.S. \"Old West\" is
discursively and practically recapitulated in the Middle East and how
the national narrative of U.S. frontier expansion receives embodied
support by soldiers who live in and through these heritage metaphors, I
seek to explore why these metaphors work in imagined \"Indian Country\"
and how they do work in real Indian Country.]{.underline} I am
interested here in metaphors that explicitly involve Native Americans
and not in the numerous parallel metaphors in U.S., British, French, and
other national media that refer to the occupation of Iraq and its
overall management strategy as reminiscent of the U.S. \"Wild West\"
with gunslingers, sheriffs (a.k.a. \"cowboy presidents\"), John Wayne
attitudes, and overall lawlessness. In this article, I blend together
David Lowenthal\'s (1996) characterization of heritage practice as
mobilizing the past into the present for present purposes, George
Lakoffs (1991, 2003) demonstrations of the power of metaphor in the
discourse and practice of war, Michael Yellow Bird\'s (2004) and Roxanne
Dunbar-Ortiz\'s (2003) worries about the need to continue decolonizing
the celebrated U.S. icons of \"cowboys and Indians,\" and Anthony
Hall\'s (2003) and Richard Drinnon\'s (1990[) propositions about a link
between the past and present treatment of Indigenous peoples by the
United States and its military activities in the 20th and early 21st
centuries in places such as the Philippines, Vietnam, and
Iraq]{.underline} (see also Den Ouden 2007; Engelhardt 2007). The
analysis is based on empirical research into the use and distribution of
this metaphor in print and Internet sources as kind of virtual
ethnography, accompanied by initial speculation on their effects. I also
examine the complex ambiguity and contestability embedded in such
heritage metaphors and how they can be turned to a variety of political
objectives. [These particular heritage metaphors tend to be used to
protect cultural sites, to recover lost antiquities, or to protest
military invasion in the Middle East]{.underline}, hinging as they do on
a cultivated (and debated) understanding of \"World Heritage\" in the
context of the so-called cradle of civilization in the Tigris-Euphrates
region. Yet this leaves [untouched]{.underline} the other heritage
[discourses in play, such as the way that the U.S. military past in
North America\'s Indigenous territories is summoned to give meaning to,
if not support, conflict on the other side of the globe]{.underline}.
[Transplanting the \"Indian Country\" metaphor across regions, through
time, and in military contexts mobilizes a complex framework
of]{.underline} already understood but [malleable national symbols to
explain events, people, the nature of battle, and the very reasons for
war in 21st-century Iraq.]{.underline} Ethnographies of the military
provide a second element of anthropology\'s role vis-?-vis military
conflict. [Studies of U.S. military bases]{.underline} (Lutz 2001); [the
experiences of soldiers as multifaceted, nonelite, and inconsistent
agents of empire (]{.underline}Brown and Lutz 2007; Lutz 2006); and the
gendered and sexist language of military training (Burke 2004) [provide
entry points for a critical]{.underline} anthropological **[perspective
on military conflict and discourse and its participants and
victims]{.underline}**. Interviews and observations of U.S. soldiers and
military officers provide key insights into the processes and
contradictions of war, but other avenues are available when such
traditional ethnographic study is not possible or not yet completed. For
instance, \"grunt literature\" in the form of books and Internet weblogs
offers access to military uses of such heritage metaphors, even though
it lacks the direct opportunity to ask more pointedly what such words
mean to them. Still, [the method pays particular attention to the
everyday deployments of these heritage metaphors as part of daily
practice in the military, particularly by listening to those who are not
making larger decisions about war but are carrying it
forward]{.underline} (e.g., Lutz 2006). In addition, broader discourses
in diverse public media? newspapers, interviews, websites? offer an
opportunity to look more closely at the [trafficking in these metaphors
at various positions within the military and outside of it, such as
soldiers, officers, strategists, reporters, artists, pundits, and the
general public]{.underline}. Recent studies have shown the value of
looking at broader public discourses about heritage and war
(Colwell-Chanthaphonh 2003; Meskell 2002; Pollock 2003; Seymour 2004).
In all cases, these voices are studied to discern a pattern of ac cepted
U.S. military and political discourse, not to serve as proof that
everyone in these positions uses or even approves of the terminology.
The diversity of opinions in the military has yet to be studied. [The
currency of the metaphor rests not only in its place in some aspects of
official military language but also in the embedded \"common sense\"
understanding that soldiers have of their own national heritage and
current military activities in the Middle East.]{.underline}

### Intense dreaming

#### The alternative is to break with Western rationalism and instead engage in intense dreaming that works towards the abolition of current regimes of oppression through community based activism.

[The body count of stigmatized, criminalized, incarcerated, legally

tortured, missing, and murdered Indigenous girls, girls and women of
color, queer and trans youth of color continues to climb.]{.underline}
The growing murder-suicide rates, statistics of missing and murdered
Indigenous and Black women, [should no longer surprise or overwhelm us
but incite us to urgent action and theorization in line with radical
women of color feminist movements mobilizing to end gendered and
racialized violence endemic to the carceral state]{.underline}. A
feeling of [mortal urgency hounds us everywhere]{.underline}, every
day[, all the time]{.underline}, all at once [in white settler
societies]{.underline} like ours; [it surrounds, envelops, and blankets
us, most often lulling us into a deep, depressed, dreamless stupor
rendering us hopeless and immobilized]{.underline}. Many of us have
already lost the battle. How many Black and Indigenous girls and women
have had their lives cut short by interpersonal, intimate, state and
state-sponsored violence since the Black socialist lesbian feminist
Combahee River Collective first held up that banner boldly declaring "We
cannot live without our lives" and initiated a self-help and
antiviolence mobilization in the late seventies? At other times, [when
not killed-off, bought-off, co-opted, or placated by the carceral state
and its so-called kinder and gentler politics of recognition and
reconciliation and its nonprofit, professionalized social ser-vice
apparatuses, we channel the pent-up sum of our intergenerational rage
into "dreaming big"]{.underline} and "making power" within our families,
intimate relations, and communities. The [mortal urgency lies in us
staying dormant and continuing to patiently over-rely on the carceral
state to guarantee the health of our lands and waterways, our human and
civil rights, our bodily integrity, our safety and security, our health
and well-being, our children's futures rather than aligning ourselves
with radical Black feminist, Indigenous de-colonial, and prison
abolitionist movements**.**]{.underline} **[We fail to listen and
actively disengage with these (re)emergent and resurgent movements that
resist the liberal and neoliberal state's politics of recognition,
visibility, and inclusion]{.underline}** at our own peril. Five hundred
years after the advent of colonial genocide and chattel slavery, the
stakes are as high as ever. As Ntozake Shange declares, "We all have
immediate cause." As Indigenous feminist Paula Gunn Allen put it, so
[much has been taken away by racialized gendered violence and carceral
state violence that "the place we live now is an idea."]{.underline}2 I
am compelled by the kinds of [futures that Indigenous feminists and
radical women of color feminists envision, and create, outside of
Western, non-Indigenous inflections of sovereignty, the nation-state,
and a liberal politics of recognition]{.underline}. In order **[to
support these generative and transformative projects and ways of
knowing, we need to visualize, speak, and practice toward what we do
dream and create]{.underline}**. According to Dian Million, "[**intense
dreaming**" is indispensable to the urgent demand made by Indigenous
feminist activist-scholars to sidestep the "static taxidermies" of
Western epistemologies and to privilege Indigenous non-Western ways of
knowing.]{.underline}3 Million writes, Dreaming \... is the effort to
make sense of relations in the worlds we live, [dreaming and empathizing
intensely our relations with past and present and the future without the
boundaries of linear time]{.underline}. [Dreaming is a
communicative]{.underline} sacred [activity]{.underline}.
[Dreaming]{.underline} often [allows us to creatively side-step all the
neat little boxes that obscure larger relations and syntheses of
imagination]{.underline}. \... [Dreaming, theory, narrative, and
critical thinking are not exclusive of each other]{.underline}. They
form different ways of knowing, and I will ask that [we might imagine
them as uneasy relations and alliances]{.underline} that may acknowledge
inclusion while we call for respecting necessary boundaries.4For me,
Million's highly generative "i[ntense dreaming" is founded in radical
relational imaginings, the politics of mutual respect and
accountability, and transformative justice feminist praxis.]{.underline}
[Beyond]{.underline} the r[ational, Western ways of
knowing]{.underline}, there are **[relational ways of knowing that draw
from sources we feel, desire, dream, and empathize with rather than from
detached positions we rationalize from.]{.underline}** The [activist
scholarship of Indigenous feminist and radical women of color feminists
free up our imaginations about what world we really want to live
in]{.underline}. **[Acknowledging]{.underline}** that **[our minds,
hearts, and political imaginations have been captured by the carceral
state and white settler imaginaries]{.underline}**, I **[push back
throughout my activist-scholarship against a purist politics that
mistakenly believes that there is a clearly demarcated and pure
"outside" to the current system]{.underline}**. As Million re-minds us,
"we dance in a politically electrified field most of our lives."[5
Indigenous feminist conceptualizations of sovereignty and decolonization
as well as Black radical feminist political claims to what Saidiya
Hartman would call statelessness, homelessness, and
motherless-ness]{.underline}6 [have]{.underline}, however, [furnished
new ways for breaking the stranglehold of carceral state necro-power as
well as pro-vided answers to]{.underline} the [questions]{.underline}
that have weighed most heavily on my mind throughout this project: To
whom do we run for cover from the carceral state? What do these
political formations and autonomous spaces that do not rely on the
nation-state look and feel like? Can we actually achieve a freedom from
interpersonal, sexual, and carceral state violence? [The **felt theory
and activist-scholarship of Indigenous feminist and radical women of
color feminist formations**, specifically feminist
formations]{.underline} like [INCITE! Women of Color Against Violence,
Young Women's Empowerment Project, Sista II Sista, Project NIA, UBUNTU,
the Bay Area Transformative Justice Collective, Families of Sisters in
Spirit (FSIS), No More Silence (NMS), and the Native Youth Sexual Health
Network (NYSHN), or those found in the Free CeCe Campaign or the Idle No
More/Indigenous Nationhood Movement]{.underline} have **[helped us to
de-naturalize white settler colonialism, carceral feminisms, and their
genealogies]{.underline}**. Our [present reality no longer has to be
assumed]{.underline}. Driven by a principled sense of mortal urgency,
grassroots, volunteer-led, local and transnational groups like FSIS,
NMS, and NYSHN, for example, [embrace a politics of Indigenous
resurgence and are interested in nurturing self-determined and
community-led responses to racialized gendered violence targeting
Indigenous girls and women rather than relying on the]{.underline}
Canadian [nation-state and further engaging with and appealing to state
institutions and government bodies.]{.underline} In their joint
statement, "It Starts With Us," which lays the groundwork to support the
resurgence of community-based responses to violence, these three
Indigenous-led organizations name [specific forms of state violence and
identify the harms of going through "the proper channels" of state-led
interventions]{.underline}---by way of providing testimonies to British
Columbia's Missing Women Commission of Inquiry to making recommendations
to the United Nations Committee for the Elimination of Discrimination
against Women (CEDAW).7 For these organizations, [heightened calls for a
national inquiry into the phenomenon of missing and murdered Indigenous
women]{.underline} in the wake of the disappearance and murder of
Loretta Saunders, a pregnant young Inuk graduate student who was writing
her thesis on the murders of three Nova Scotia Indigenous women, [is a
waste of time]{.underline}.8

### Native Feminism

Toward a Different Kind of Gender and Women\'s Studies

In an introduction to a 2009 special issue of the journal Wicazo Sa
Review, Mishuana R. Goeman and Jennifer Nez Denetdale speak to the ways
in which terms like \"feminist\" are contested, but more importantly,
they speak to the shared aims (overlaps) of Native feminist theories.
[They]{.underline} write that

we [affirm the usefulness of a Native feminism\'s analysis
and]{.underline}, indeed, [declare that Native feminist analysis is
crucial if we are determined to decolonize as Native
peoples]{.underline}\.... \[F\]or Native women, there is no one
definition of Native feminism; rather, [there are multiple definitions
and layers of what it means to do Native feminist analysis]{.underline}.
However, as [Native feminists]{.underline}, our dreams and goals
overlap; we [desire to open up spaces where generations of colonialism
have silenced Native peoples]{.underline} about the status of their
women and about the intersections of power and domination that have also
shaped Native nations and gender relations. We rely on still developing
frameworks for Native feminisms to examine and reflect upon the
reverberations in our Native homelands. (10)

[Goeman and Denetdale]{.underline} clearly [delineate what is at
stake]{.underline} in Native feminist theories for Indigenous women. We
want to extend their work to consider what is at stake for feminist
discourses at large. [Native feminist theories yield valuable insights
and analyses]{.underline} for gender and women\'s studies, yet are
subject [to conceptual and spatial erasures]{.underline} (Hall 2008)
precisely [because]{.underline} [settler colonialism as a contemporary
social order and structure has been invisibilized.]{.underline} Lorenzo
Veracini (2011), a scholar who has led recent academic efforts to
theorize settler colonialism as an important global phenomenon, posits
that [settler colonialism is \"characterized by a persistent drive to
supersede the conditions of its operation\"]{.underline} (3)-that is[,
to make itself seem natural]{.underline}, without origin (and without
end), [and inevitable]{.underline}. This is why a politics of inclusion
is so undesirable within Native feminist frameworks. [Consider a
slogan]{.underline} created by national activist organization INCITE!
Women of Color Against Violence: [\"Feminist since 1492\"]{.underline}
(INCITE! 2006). [This slogan]{.underline} succinctly [rejects the
Eurocentric, Global North-hegemonic notion of]{.underline} first,
second, and third [waves of feminism and acknowledges]{.underline} [that
Indigenous women have been at the forefront of struggles against
domination]{.underline} long [before the nineteenth
century]{.underline}, especially in the face of empire. We do not need
permission to be included in feminist thought or writings; [Native
feminist theories already inform and have impacted whitestream feminist
theories]{.underline}. We are arguing that [there cannot be feminist
thought and theory without Native feminist theory. The experiences and
intellectual contributions of Indigenous women are not on the margins;
we have been an invisible presence in the center, hidden by the gendered
logics of settler colonialism for over 500 years.]{.underline}

Unmasking the forces that have hidden Indigenous women and Native
feminist theories within gender and women\'s studies therefore requires
critical reflection and a commitment toward structural change. [Native
feminist theories]{.underline} at their heart [challenge the academy\'s
common modes of disciplinarity;]{.underline} [they exhort ethnic studies
and Indigenous studies, as well as gender and women\'s studies, to
address the erasure of Indigenous women and Native feminist
theories]{.underline} [in ways that]{.underline} are not simply token
inclusion of seemingly secondary (or beyond) issues, but rather [shift
the entire basis of how disciplines see and understand their proper
subjects]{.underline}. Thus, ethnic studies and Indigenous studies must
centrally address theories of heteropatriarchy; and [gender and women\'s
studies must centrally address theories of settler colonialism and
indigeneity.]{.underline} Undoubtedly, there is more work to do to
achieve these goals in all these disciplines, although significant
inroads have been made in recent years, particularly in Indigenous
studies. What follows are five key challenges that Native feminist
theories offer to feminist discourses, especially as these inform gender
and women\'s studies, and provisional suggestions toward a productive
response.

#### Native feminist theory is key to deconstruct heteropatriarchy and settler colonialism, which in the world of the aff are inextricably tied

//nsp

[Native feminist theories]{.underline} centrally [address]{.underline}
two intertwined [ideas that are significant but often overlooked in
feminist discourses]{.underline}: [the]{.underline} [United States and
many other Western countries]{.underline}, including Canada, Australia,
and New Zealand, are [settler colonial nation]{.underline}-states, and
[settler colonialism has been and continues to be a gendered
process]{.underline}. Because [the United States is balanced upon
notions of white supremacy and heteropatriarchy]{.underline}, everyone
living in the country is not only racialized and gendered, but also has
a relationship to settler colonialism. [Native feminist theories offer
new and reclaimed ways of thinking through not only how settler
colonialism has impacted Indigenous and settler communities, but also
how feminist theories can imagine and realize different modes of
nationalism and alliances in the future]{.underline} (see also Smith
2007).1 This article highlights five central challenges that Native
feminist theories pose to gender and women\'s studies. With these
challenges, we offer suggestions for meaningful engagement, arguing
overall that [attending to the links between heteropatriarchy and
settler colonialism is intellectually and politically
imperative.]{.underline}

Although this article focuses primarily on gender and women\'s studies,
[Native feminist theories]{.underline} also importantly [highlight how
ethnic studies has failed to]{.underline} adequately [address settler
colonialism]{.underline}. [Attending to settler colonialism requires a
significant departure from how gender and women\'s studies and ethnic
studies are regularly understood and taught]{.underline}.
Conventionally, it is assumed that gender and women\'s studies is
inclusive of those who identify as women and indeed all people who are
gendered, and that ethnic studies addresses Indigenous concerns, along
with those of other ethnic groups. [These fields teach people to think
about themselves in relation to a gendered and racialized
society]{.underline} (Omi and Winant 1994). However, engaging settler
colonialism involves different frameworks from the ones these fields
often prioritize. While both gender and women\'s studies and ethnic
studies unmask gender and race as social constructions, with often
devastating material effects for women and nonwhite people,
respectively, [these fields also expose various mythologies about gender
and race, including the myth of misogyny and racism as to-be-expected
characteristics of human nature.]{.underline} Yet, within this important
work, [too often the consideration of Indigenous peoples remains rooted
in understanding colonialism]{.underline} (like statesanctioned slavery)
[as an historical point in time away from which our society has
progressed. Centering settler colonialism within gender and women\'s
studies and ethnic studies instead exposes the still-existing structure
of settler colonization and its powerful effects on Indigenous peoples
and others]{.underline}. [This recognition within gender and women\'s
studies and ethnic studies]{.underline} makes possible new visions of
what decolonization might look like for all peoples. [It also opens up
the possibility of new forms of activism]{.underline} based on
critically thought-out alliances, [rather than always taking the shape
of alliances within and between seemingly naturally formed and
identifiable groups of people-namely, women and people of color-as
given.]{.underline}

In fact, [the prevalence of liberal multicultural discourses today
effectively works to maintain settler colonialism because they make it
easy to assume that all minorities and ethnic groups are different
though working toward inclusion and equality, each in its own similar
and parallel way. Justice is often put in terms that coincide with the
expansion of the settler state]{.underline} (see Scott Lauria Morgensen
\[2011\] for a discussion of the compatibility of queer politics with
white normativity and settler society). While Indigenous peoples do form
important alliances with people of color, [Indigenous communities\'
concerns are often not about achieving formal equality or civil rights
within a nationstate, but instead achieving substantial independence
from a Western nation-state-independence decided on their own
terms]{.underline}. The feminist concerns of white women, women of
color, and Indigenous women thus often differ and conflict with one
another. In other words, within the context of land and settler
colonialism, [the issues facing Indigenous women, as inseparable from
the issues facing Indigenous peoples as a whole, are resolved via
decolonization and sovereignty, not (]{.underline}just[)
parity.]{.underline}

We write as three Indigenous women-identified scholars situated
variously in the disciplines of ethnic studies, education, and
Indigenous studies.2 [Each of us works to apply Indigenous theories and
decolonizing frameworks to contemporary social realities in order to
contest the rampant misrepresentations of Indigenous peoples and their
lives in school curricula, the media, and the sociological imagination,
and Native feminism has given us important tools to do such
work.]{.underline} We believe that the challenges this article describes
will be relevant to many disciplines, including our home disciplines of
ethnic studies, education, and Indigenous studies, where feminist
theories have long been important. Yet, [we address this article
primarily to theorists and activists of mainstream, or \"whitestream,\"
feminism]{.underline}, as well as to other feminisms and nationalisms,
including Asian, black, Latina, third world, transnational, and queer
feminisms and nationalisms, because [greater engagement between Native
feminist theories and other feminisms is sorely needed.]{.underline}3

[Our challenges]{.underline} respectfully [push]{.underline} both
[conventional modes of feminism and more radical ones]{.underline}, as
[we see the need to interrogate everywhere what Rey Chow has termed
\"the ascendancy of whiteness,\"]{.underline} a concept denoting the
multiple ways that the condition of being white, and enjoying the often
nationalist privileges of that whiteness, is made to seem neutral and
inviting or inclusive of racial, sexual, and other minorities (Chow,
qtd. in Morgensen 2010, 105; see also Puar 2007). [By being
included]{.underline} (whether by choice, coercion, or force) [in
whiteness, a wide array of Indigenous peoples]{.underline}, people of
color, and queer communities [are given the \"opportunity\" to take part
in the settling processes that dispossess just such \"other-ed\" peoples
globally]{.underline}. Such opportunities include everything from
participating in the global War on Terror, as scholars like Jasbir K.
Puar (2007) brilliantly critique, to naturalizing and maintaining
settler colonialism in the United States. We argue that [allying one\'s
self with feminism should not require consenting to inclusion within a
larger agenda of whiteness;]{.underline} indeed, we believe that [Native
feminist theories demonstrate that feminisms, when allied with other key
causes, hold a unique potential to decolonize the ascendancy of
whiteness in many global contexts.]{.underline}

Overall, we write in conversation with other Native and Indigenous
studies scholars at a time when Native feminist theories are at the
forefront of many of the most exciting and challenging works coming out
of Native and Indigenous studies. Yet, Native feminist theories, and the
arguments we make in this article, come from a long line of activism and
intellectual thought. We, and the contemporary Native feminist theories
our article focuses on, are indebted to a rich history of Native
feminist theories circulated both within and against whitestream
feminism and other academic fields since at least the 1960s. [Native
feminist theories have thrived in the past five decades, and yet, these
theories have been given far too little attention by academic
disciplines whose fields might benefit from such work the
most]{.underline}.4 We view the work done by both early and contemporary
Native women scholars, artists, and activists, often completed without
substantial institutional support and with significant personal cost, as
intellectual gifts. Without them, our uphill battle would be even
steeper and lonelier and our own thinking less rich. Gifts like these
come with a kind of responsibility-a responsibility that is less a
burden than a desire to continue to create a future for Native feminist
theories to thrive. Thus, our [article is oriented by a passion to
amplify Native feminist theories in a continued effort to unsettle both
the academy at large and gender and women\'s studies in
particular]{.underline}.

### Paradigmatic analysis

theorize the positionality of the Red Indian as defined by clearing and
civilization as grammars of suffering.]{.underline}** [This]{.underline}
theoretical [focus understands Red existence as]{.underline} primarily
[defined by the genocidal clearing of the Western hemisphere of Red
bodies.]{.underline} This must be the starting point for analysis and
explication if Red bodies are to move forward towards understanding what
existence inside the parameters and definitions of value of the
Settler/Slave Master means, and if there is a possibility of living
outside the Settler's measure of value (and what living outside those
measures might mean). The aim here is thus to [**engage in a
paradigmatic analysis of Red bodies within the libidinal and political
coordinates that, in line with Jared Sexton, I am inclined to call the
world.** This analysis focuses on how the ontological position of
Redness is defined by its position and relationships in the political
and libidinal economy and how it is expressed historically.]{.underline}
Drawing primarily from the economic works of Georges Bataille, I frame
political economy in two ways: firstly, as a "general economy" that sees
the production and consumption as an artificial divide between the total
movement of energy across the global occurring on both molecular and
molar scales; secondly, as intricately linked and intertwined with the
libidinal economy. The libidinal economy follows Wilderson's definition
in Red, White, and Black in which he quotes Jared Sexton as saying that
**[the libidinal economy is "the economy, or distribution and
arrangement, of desire and identification]{.underline}** (their
condensation and displacement), and the complex relationship between
sexuality and the unconscious." Furthermore, [this paradigmatic analysis
seeks to interrogate and advance Leftist theorization of ontology and to
reveal, in line with Jodi Byrd, how the "Indian errant" at the heart of
theorization serves to articulate the coherence of the general
economy.]{.underline} Whereas Marxism, feminism, postcolonialism or any
number of (potentially intersecting) fields of thought may focus on the
dispossession its chosen subject faces, these fields still have within
themselves the ability to articulate that loss. The Marxist can name and
locate their loss at the site of the wage relation in which the
dispossession of labor-power creates alienation and exploitation as
definitive grammars of suffering for the Human worker. The feminist and
queer subject, even when subjected to the most profound suffering by
heteropatriarchal violence, can articulate and locate their concern and
loss within the political imagination: the equality of the wage, the
destruction of the gender binary, the end of the objectifying male gaze.
[Even the postcolonial subject, often the focus of contemporary Native
Studies, can locate loss at the site of the dispossession of land,
sovereignty, culture, or genealogy, something not afforded to the Red
Native who not only serves as the model of possibility for settler
colonialism, but through co-operative processes of clearing and
civilization is transformed into a genocided object.]{.underline} **[The
ability to speak of one's loss - to mark it, to understand it, and to
conceive of its absence--is, the privilege of Humanness]{.underline}**,
the ability to live---to exist---within the coordinates of the world.
The implication of this and Afropessimism's interrogation is unsettling
to these fields of thought insofar as it troubles readings of the
political and libidinal economy and negates the ability for theory to
provide coherent solutions for the dead Indian who no longer contains
within itself the ability to possess life, which is always already to
say Humanness. The focus of this critique then aims not at the
politically conservative nor at the fields of political science and
sociology, which seek to understand the experiences of Red life as
purely empirical phenomena and attempts to articulate a solution to such
problems within the structuring logic of the White Settler-Master. Given
that Redness exists as non-Human, that is, if it exists as that which
lacks relationality to Humanity, then the concern is not with empirics
or conservative ideology, but with so-called "allies." Fields of thought
such as Marxism, Feminism, Postcolonialism, and their fellows are
parasitic upon Redness as outside the exchange of loss that is
alienation and exploitation in so far that the humanist structures
within those fields must presume the continual, gratuitous, structural
violence of Red non-Being.

[In defining a framework for evaluating and forwarding concepts and
ideas, we adopt specific frameworks that are intertribally rele- vant

have pointed out time and time again, the question of ontology for
Indigenous peoples is rooted firmly in the question of relationships
guided by respect, reciprocity, and renewal.14 [The ontological question
is, therefore, never captured within an individualistic ontology but
always multiple and relational.]{.underline} The relationship between
two entities is not simply important to their individual existences, but
it pre-cedes them and makes the entities themselves possible.This form
of being, however, is often denied through a political ontology that is
undergirded by the assumptions of a violently racist Hegelianism.
Attempts at true recognition fall prey to the Settler's misrecognition,
which serves to place Indigenous spirituality in Western metaphysics.
This transla-tion is a form of cosmological violence that reduces spirit
to metaphysics.15Cosmological violence does not operate within the
dialectics of losses and gains but rather is a violence against the
cosmos itself as well as all who reside within it. Violence that
operates at this level necessarily escapes cap-ture by rationality and
operates within an anarational economy of violence. It is anarational in
that it exceeds rationality, but such an excess not only exceeds or
moves beyond rationality but is an excess against rationality.16The
prefix "ana- " means "up, against, back, re- " and, as such,
anarationality is above rationality; it is against it, pushes back on
it, returns rationality to itself.17 [The very nature of anarational
violence is its condition of irrational-ity; however, it is not
irrational in that it lacks a rationale but rather in that it is a
rationale that exceeds and disturbs the very nature of
rationality]{.underline}--- an ante- rationality that is inflected by
the ante- ontology of the Native.18 [Such an ante- ontology, in escaping
the paradigm of in/sanity, frustrates and, in doing so, calls into being

### Refusal 

#### The alternative is an intervention into the relational forces that [re-centers our desires]{.underline} -- through a refusal to breathe in settler subjectivity 

**Kouri and Skott-Myhre 15 (Scott Kouri, University of Victoria, Hans
Skott Myhre, Brock University, "Catastrophe: a transversal mapping of
colonialism and settler subjectivity", pg 3 -- pg 9) //Mberhe recut**

The limit to the regimes of transcendence is remarkably similar to that
of addiction. The capacity of a drug to sustain sovereignty over an
addict's life is directly proportional to its ability to seamlessly
deliver its anesthetic or amnesiac promise. The problem is that the
capacities of living force are always impinging on and at least
marginally exceeding the limit conditions of amnesia and anesthetic so
that both pain and memory leak through. The tension between the force of
life and its leakage and the promise of transcendent escape wears on the
subjectivity in question until, in the vernacular of addiction, the
addict hits rock bottom and is forced to seek a new life. Just as Nazism
sullies democrats not responsible for it, settler colonialism sullies
those of us settlers who are weary of struggling to deny or escape our
living relations with our Indigenous friends, sisters, and brothers. We
are literally sick at heart and soul over the denial of the actuality of
our common interests that would compose us as friends. [The ordeal of
settlement has made it difﬁcult for us as settlers to look at each other
or ourselves without weariness, and this weariness extends to all those
we encounter as other.]{.underline} However, as Deleuze and Guattari
tell us, it is at just such a point that there exists the possibility of
breaching the limit of the existing social conﬁguration through a
threshold of new thought: 'After an ordeal that is too
powerful...inexpressible... \[comes\]a mutual distress, a mutual
weariness that forms a new right of thought'. 29 Similarly, Veracini
explains that it is at the point of realization regarding the
ineffective rhetoric of anti-colonialism and language of partnership
that a 'new language and imagination are needed'. 30 **[We propose that
if we are to abandon the transcendent formulations of settlement and
settler subjectivity and have a new right of thought, we must form a new
unconscious that is capable of more than repression and
sublimation.]{.underline}** [Thus far we have mapped settler colonialism
and the settler unconscious founded on its denial.]{.underline} We have
argued that repression, abstraction, and the appeal to transcendence are
one possible set of responses to the catastrophe of settlement. **[In
this section we provide an alternative subjectivity founded on an
affective engagement with colonialism and the living relations that
constitute and are disrupted by it.]{.underline}** While Guattari tells
us that 'we have the unconscious we deserve!'31 He goes on to suggest
that a different form of unconscious is possible, not simply an
unconscious of the specialists of the unconscious, not simply an
unconscious crystallized in the past, congealed in an institutional
discourse, but, on the contrary, an unconscious turned towards the
future, whose screen would be none other than the possible itself, the
possible as hypersensitive to language, but also the possible
hypersensitive to touch, hypersensitive to the socius, hypersensitive to
the cosmos.32 Such an unconscious elides the transcendent by denying it
the sustenance of the denial of living catastrophe. For such an
unconscious, the temporality of catastrophe is never in the past but
always in the present capacity for becoming that which is not yet. This
is not to deny the trauma of past catastrophic actions or relations of
force. [It is instead to refuse their seduction as inevitability through
institutional abstract discourse that crystallizes or congeals the past
into a transcendent carapace that encapsulates subjective relations in
reductive repetitions of old battles and unﬁnished resentments. Indeed,
such an unconscious would break the carapace of transcendent denial,
opening a ﬁeld of hypersensitivity that would not shrink from the
complexities of pain and joy that make up actual living relations. Such
an unconscious is instantiated within individual subjects and operates
as a productive instigator of subjectivity, but it does not represent
them, nor is it restrained or restricted by any particular singular
corporeal assemblage. It is a collective unconscious, but not in the
Jungian sense of global structural archetypes. It is instead the
collectivity of living force as absolute possibility. To rethink the
settler in this way is to unmoor settlement and open the ﬁeld of what
Deleuze and Guattari 33 and Braidotti 34 refer to as nomadic
subjectivity. **It is to move from the lack and negation of the colonial
project to a ﬁeld of afﬁrmation of life itself.**]{.underline} We deploy
afﬁrmation here as the prospective belief that painful affects and
catastrophic circumstances are transformed, not through historicizing or
negating catastrophe, but through sensitivity to it and activity in it.
The Freudian/Lacanian reading of the settler unconscious that we mapped
above presents our disavowals of catastrophe as an impingement on our
creative capacity to (re)produce ourselves in new and ever-changing
relationships. Conversely, in the production of an alternative
subjectivity commensurate with the hypersensitive unconscious that
Guattari intuits, we propose a perhaps counterintuitive afﬁrmation of
the present. Our sobering analyses of the present brings us to the
threshold of encounter where abstraction gives way to a material
unconscious capable of drawing out patterns in the present as relays to
possible futures. Such an unconscious, hypersensitive to its material
and relational constitution, can revisit that which was abstracted --
the site of repressed horrors and guilt -- as a repository of desire
trapped and diverted by such denials. Our existing material relations
offer an almost inﬁnite range of modes of being that have been precluded
by colonialism, and the trick is now to work through colonialism to get
at those possible worlds, affects, relations. In opposition to the
abstract worlds and peoples of colonialism, afﬁrmation of this one
living world can only be done through a full engagement in the living
relationships and affects that are foreclosed by colonial mappings.
[Mapping settler subjectivity in afﬁrmation is a process of enduring the
affects of loss, pain, grief, guilt, joy, hope, confusion, and anger
involved in the lost comforts of an invulnerable identity and
accountably recreating ourselves in relation to all others in this
world.]{.underline} The settler unconscious has provided the necessary
mechanisms for denial and repression, but the forces and ﬂows of life
always exceed these closures. For some of us, the suffering of
Indigenous peoples and our own complicity in it is no longer to be
avoided. For others, the friendships and joys we share with people we
have come to care about and love inspires a desire for change. In either
case, we settlers must ﬁrst forgo an identity premised on amnesia
regarding the ongoing violence of settlement and our role in it. It also
means to endure such experience with a sobriety capable of understanding
the singular reconﬁgurations of relationships and responsibilities that
follow such a process. While the settler is the site of privileged
subjectivity within current neoliberal power, an immanent remapping of
the settler as intricately produced through living relations afﬁrms its
contingency in geography, otherness, and the catastrophes from which
current neoliberal power has emerged. To open the settler body back up
to history, geography, and the Other is to begin a process of
subjectiﬁcation constituted by external forces, connections, and ﬂows.
We are referring to the relationship between history and geography as
Deleuze and Guattari explicate it, Maurice Ronai demonstrates that the
landscape, the reality as well as the notion, is tied to a very
particular semiotic system and very particular apparatuses of power:
this is one of the sources of geography, as well as a principle behind
its political subordination (the land-scape as 'the face of the
fatherland or nation'). 35 To reengage the settler with material life as
both history and geography with the related loss of transcendent
identity rooted in the semiotics and apparatuses of colonial power is
replete with pain and joy. It allows us to produce ourselves within a
life that proliferates in a singular instantiation of immanent material
ﬂows in mobile rearrangements. This is to move from an abstract mapping
of colonialism and subjectivity to an affective cartography of living
relations and immanent subjectivity. **[A cartography of living
relations disperses the secure identity of the settler and repositions
it as an active participant in particular relationships, practices,
campaigns, strategies, and tactics that engage colonialism and
decolonization. The settler subject is reconﬁgured within ongoing,
dispersed, and contradictory processes of subjectiﬁcation within various
relational assemblages. A cartography of living relations maps such
dynamic processes and therefore challenges the inevitability and
stability of the settler subject through an engagement with the
relational forces that constitute the settler.]{.underline}** Guattari
proposes that we think in terms of refrains rather than wholes in this
type of situation.36 The refrain of the settler can thus be both a
repetition of an identity located within a particular space--time matrix
and a singularized autopoietic and networked instantiation of that
identity. The immanent unconscious is therefore not personal and
representational (in that it is the storehouse of forbidden
representations of our personal desires) but active (in that it
constitutes the assemblages through which desire ﬂows and produces). In
challenging the inevitably of the settler subject and a reconﬁguration
of him in immanent relational ﬂows, we are calling for a dispersion of
the unconscious onto a plane of relational and intensive constitution.
Importantly, we are not making any suggestions regarding Indigenous
subjectivity as such commentary would simply reiterate the unfortunate
historical practice of the dominant vernacular refusing its own
constitutive ruptural necessity through the diversion of the Other. Our
comments here are a proposal speciﬁc to the historical trajectory of the
settler from inside that project. Furthermore, we are expressly not
arguing that Indigenous peoples are a mechanism for settler
transformation, nor, following the warnings of Lawson and of Veracini,
suggesting the Indigenization of the settler.37 Our proposal is for
settlers to map new processes of subjectiﬁcation that are accountable to
their singular constitutive relationships. Using the settler as an
identity in transforming the unconscious from one of lack to one of
material constitution is our ﬁrst task in the construction of an
immanent subjectivity. [Identiﬁcation of settler subjectivity
reintroduces the coordinates of colonialism into our constitution and
allows for a mapping of current power relations and the complexity of
affect and desire.]{.underline} Afﬁrming a settler subjectivity then
does two related things: (1) it reintroduces the catastrophe of
colonialism as a living present and(2)it resists such a present through
what Braidotti terms abecoming.38 The ﬁrst signiﬁes or represents
identity in a politically charged and affectively engaging way; the
second opens on to new forms of subjectivity through idiosyncratic
relationality. [The acknowledgment of a settler subjectivity immediately
undermines itself in that settler subjectivity is premised on a
repression of the actualities of colonialism and a continued
accumulation of dominant force.]{.underline} Enunciating a settler
subjectivity therefore simultaneously reiﬁes an identity while calling
forth a new process of subjectifying -- a becoming -- which can be
ethically accountable to contemporary living relationships. By engaging
the repressions, disconnections, and stagnations that have come with
complicity in colonialism, we can make ourselves vulnerable to the
affects and becomings that our illusions once protected us from. In
making ourselves vulnerable, we follow Spinoza39 in seeking endurance
and afﬁrmation as practices for forming a subjectivity worthy of the
catastrophe and relations that produced it. We can no longer avoid pain
and uncertainty; we must become active through them. There is no way to
rationally comprehend the horrors of colonization, and we argue that
rationality is actually one very potent way of avoiding the pain. The
ethics being called for here is not grounded in rational principles but
in active and afﬁrmative engagement with affect, body, intuition,
accepting the ineffable and incomprehensible as the threshold of change
and encounter. Braidotti argues that enduring affects that are
relational is necessary for developing an ethical subjectivity. She
states that 'endurance points to the struggle to sustain the pain
without being annihilated by it'40 and links this pain to betrayal and
wounds simultaneously hard to forget and remember. The afﬁrmation of
settler colonialism reintroduces the rupture of catastrophe as an
unsettling affective fracture that opens settler subjectivity onto new
sets of complex and interdependent relations with people, animals, and
plant life. Veracini argues that a 'post settler move must emphasise
open endedness' and a practice of reconciliation and ongoing
relationship.41The unsettling effect of afﬁrming the complexity of
contemporary affects and relations, and further understanding oneself as
constituted by them, is to risk being vulnerable to the unpredictable,
to the directions that relationships can take us, to not knowing. The
role of sensation in this project then is to maximize our capacities to
be affected by our environment and the people, organisms, and bodies
that constitute it, yet maintain our living bodies. Our lives therefore
become premised on a desire to affect and be affected: to increase
power, express capacity, and compose our subjectivity as immanent to our
relationships. For Spinoza, the philosopher of immanence, joy is an
increase in our body's power to affect and be affected.42 In contrast,
the sad passions of disgust, resentment, pain, and denial are feelings
of diminished constitutive force. An immanent subjectivity composed in
the catastrophe of colonialism therefore seeks ways to participate
joyfully in decolonization and increase sensitivity and endurance
necessary for transformation. Such an immanent subjectivity seeks ways
to afﬁrm the transformation of sad passions in the present, encounter
the sensations that will push them through a threshold of change, and
endure the changes that follow. [Each instantiation of such an ethics
will be dependent on the immanent relationships between the bodies,
histories, and milieus that compose the encounter. We therefore cannot
prescribe a particular set of actions and practices to be followed but
instead offer a new cartography and ethics to work with.]{.underline}
The endurance of sad passions such as guilt and shame holds the
possibility of transformation when relationships and the body are
premised in ethical processes. In this rendering, affect and
psychological movement are highlighted as catalysts for change, whereas
stagnation, repression, avoidance, and rigidiﬁcation are synonymous with
violence to self and other. Braidotti invites us to use the concepts of
zoe and becoming to think with new hope about life, future, and
vulnerability.43 Following Spinoza, she offers an account of ethics in
which conﬂict is recast in a larger frame of life that implies that the
harm done to others is simultaneously visited upon oneself and,
conversely, empowering others brings joy and an increase of power to
oneself. All of our freedoms and affects are interdependent and
positively correlated: taking from another gives one less, not more.
Rather than a lack that inaugurates desire and action, the immanent
subject sketched out here is constituted by a vital force of desire that
is ontological and constitutive. Action and afﬁrmation are desire
increasing its power to act in bodies through which it ﬂows and is
apprehended. Increasing the interactions, sensitivity, and relational
interdependence of bodies increases their expressive capacity through
diversity and experimentation. Braidotti argues that the traditional
uniﬁed vision of the subject which rendered woman, nature, and native as
the Other in modernism returns at the end of postmodernism as a
non-unitarian subject whose other is vitality or life force: zoe.44 Zoe
can be contrasted with bios, or what Foucault called biopower, where the
body is associated with knowledge, intervention, and control. Biopower
preeminently includes the social apparatus's power 'to ensure, maintain,
or develop its life'45 or reduce life to bare and perishable conditions.
Foucault's concept of biopower helps to explain how technologies that
manage the health of urbanized populations do so through surveillance
and administrative means. By deploying such technologies, governments
seek to optimize the integration of subjects into the capitalist system
as workers who work most efﬁciently through a docile subjectivity. The
intersection of biopower and docility is the site of production of a
subject whose life and capacities, now appropriated by capitalism, are
worth maximizing. Subjects who do not become produced at this
intersection, or whose subjectivities and productive capacities are not
easily appropriated by capitalism, are left bare. This is the realm of
precarious life, life ungoverned. While this conception of zoe maps the
functioning of power, it is limited in its ability to theorize the
creative force inherent in material bodies that are not strictly
disciplined and produced by governmentality. Braidotti emphasizes that,
in contrast to the concept of bare life, zoe can be conceived as 'a
creative force that constructs possible futures'.46 In contemporary
settler colonialism, biopower is deployed, for instance, as
institutional indifference to the murders and rapes of Indigenous women
and youth who do not achieve recognizable subjectivity.47 In British
Columbia alone, hundreds of cases of abuse, rape, and missing persons
have gone uninvestigated because the victims were Aboriginal women -- a
situation which the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of
Indigenous Peoples recently condemned as a human rights violation.48
Biopower here is evident in the state's differential response to the
lives of its subjects. Beyond the failure to change structures which
perpetuate violence against Indigenous peoples, de Finney49 argues that
Indigenous women are re-victimized by state failure to intervene and
address racialized and sexualized violence by erasing their presence.
Biomedical conceptualizations of trauma, for example, are disconnected
from their colonial context and veils the links between research,
psychology, and political agendas to exterminate Indigenous nations and
peoples. [Not only does the state differentially govern life and death
through control, calculation, health promotion, and intervention, butal
so it is simultaneously constituted by such practices. The state is
co-constituted by the divisions that are made between the life and death
of its subjects. The settler colonial state is only the state insofar as
it bolsters the life of settlers, and it would cease to function as a
state if Indigenous life, presence, and history were not systematically
eradicated.]{.underline} Bios, as the manipulation of life related to
social hygiene, governmentality, and control, is the Other side of life
as zoe, which Braidotti theorizes as 'the mindless vitality of Life
carrying on independently of and regardless of rational control'.50 The
colonized version of 'the human' identiﬁed by whiteness, maleness,
heterosexuality, wealth, and standard language use has been historically
conﬂated with bios, whereas zoe has been historically associated with
woman, nature, and racialized other. In advanced capitalism, and in
connection with biotechnological advances, however, zoe, as the life
force represented as the Others of the traditional subject, has now
taken a central place in political economy. The complex intersections of
zoe, bios, capital, politics, and technology are now the contested and
transformative spaces of contemporary subjectivity marked by
environmental, global, and colonial catastrophes. The way forward, we
argue, following Braidotti, is through 'forces, desires, and values that
act as empowering modes of being' rather than a moralistic set of
'negative, resentful emotions and life-denying reactive passions'.51 A
consideration of zoe as the non-representable becoming of life force
queries new approaches to crafting decolonizing subjectivities and
ethics. Zoe moves our analysis away again from abstract representations
of life and toward the world of encounter, affect, and action. Deleuze
and Guattari write that 'we know nothing about a body until we know what
it can do, in other words, what its affects are, how they can or cannot
enter into composition with other affects, with the affects of another
body'.52 Afﬁrmation requires that we analyze the power that bodies have
through an experimentation with capacities that can be expressed in
relational webs of action. It is an ethics of engagement that seeks a
transformative encounter in the space of catastrophe rather than seeking
an escape through a transcendent and abstract outside, such as god,
democracy, rationality, or utopia. [Our ﬁrst task, then, is the sober
analysis and acknowledgment of horror of the historical events of
settler colonialism that have constituted settler subjectivity. Our
second task is to experiment with new forms of subjectivity capable of
transforming the negative affects and sad passions of such a rupture
into modes of being capable of deepening relationships based on
accountability to each other.]{.underline} As Veracini notes 'the
struggle against settler colonialism must aim to keep the
settler-inidgenous relationship ongoing'.53 Braidotti builds with
Deleuze on Spinoza's concept of endurance and states that 'endurance is
self-afﬁrmation. It is also an ethical principle of afﬁrmation of the
positivity of the intensive subject -- its joyful afﬁrmation as
potentia. The subject is a spatiotemporal compound which frames the
boundaries of processes of becoming'.54 Here Braidotti highlights the
embodied maintenance of pain or pleasure without the body being
destroyed by them. Endurance is the ability to endure the transformation
from negative to positive affect, which becomes the hallmark of
sustainability and self-preservation within experimental praxiological
engagements. It is the endurance and working through of fear, pain, or
anxiety to the point of transformation, not the avoidance, disgust,
resignation, or rejection of suffering and death, that afﬁrms the
transformative potential of life in all its difference. Braidotti
writes, 'Paradoxically, it is those who have already cracked up a bit,
those who have suffered pain and injury, who are better placed to take
the lead in the process of ethical transformation'.55 Braidotti's
rendition of the nomadic subject proposes that engagements with
difference and others, including land and other forms of life, are
necessary for sustainability and survival. Otherness, for Braidotti, 'is
the threshold of transformative encounters'56 that prompt and mobilize
'ﬂows of afﬁrmation of values and forces which are not yet sustained by
the current conditions'.57 [The power to resist the present is here
cultivated in our capacities to be vulnerable and endure the present's
most virulent aspects, to cultivate relations that exceed the abstract
conﬁgurations of oppositional subjectivity.]{.underline}

### Refuse University

#### Refusing the university is the only way to break down the norms perpetuating set colonization as well as capitalism and feminism

Sandy **Grande**, 9-6-20**18**, \"Refusing the University,\" No
Publication, <https://www.academia.edu/37026360/Refusing_the_University>

[The inspirational work of Black radical and Indigenous scholars compels
thinking beyond the limits of academic recognition and about the
generative spaces of refusal that not only reject settler logics but
also foster possibilities of co-resistance]{.underline}. The prospect of
c[oalition re-raises one of the initial animating questions of this
chapter: What kinds of solidarities can be developed among peoples with
a commitment to working beyond the imperatives of capital and the
settler state]{.underline}? Clearly, [despite the ubiquitous and often
overly facile calls for solidarity, building effective coalitions is
deeply challenging, even among insurgent scholars.]{.underline} Within
this particular context, tensions between Indigenous sovereignty and
decolonial projects and anti-racist, social justice projects, raise a
series of suspicions: whether calls for Indigenous sovereignty somehow
elide the a priori condition of blackness (the "unsovereign" subject),17
whether anti-racist struggles sufficiently account for Indigenous
sovereignty as a land-based struggle elucidated outside regimes of
property, and whether theorizations of [settler colonialism sufficiently
account for the forces and structures of white supremacy, racial
slavery, and antiblackness]{.underline}. [Rather than posit such
tensions as terminally incommensurable, however, I want to suggest a
parallel politics of dialectical co-resistance]{.underline}. When Black
peoples can still be killed but not murdered; when Indians are still
made to disappear; when [(Indigenous) land and Black bodies are still
destroyed and accumulated for settler profit; it is incumbent upon all
those who claim a commitment to refusing the white supremacist,
capitalist, settler state, to do the hard work of building
"interconnected movements for decolonization" (Coulthard, 2014). The
struggle is real]{.underline}. It is both material and psychological,
both method and politics, and thus must necessarily straddle the
both/and (as opposed to either/or) coordinates of revolutionary change.
[In terms of process, this means working simultaneously beyond
resistance and through the enactment of refusal---as fugitive,
abolitionist, and Indigenous, sovereign subjects. Within the context of
the university, this means replacing calls for more inclusive and
diverse, safe spaces within the university with the development of a
network of sovereign, safe houses outside the university.]{.underline}
Kelley reminds us of the long history of this struggle, recalling the
Institute of the Black World at Atlanta University (1969), the
Mississippi Freedom Schools, and the work of Black feminists Patricia
Robinson, Donna Middleton, and Patricia Haden as inspirational models.
As a contemporary model, he references Harney and Moten's vision of the
undercommons as a space of possibility: a fugitive space wherein the
pursuit of knowledge is not perceived as a path toward upward mobility
and material wealth but rather as a means toward eradicating oppression
in all of its forms (Undercommoning Collective). The ultimate goal,
according to Kelley (2016), is to create in the present a future that
overthrows the logic of neoliberalism. [Scholars within Native studies
similarly build upon a long tradition of refusing the university,
theorizing from and about sovereignty through land-based models of
education. Whereas a fugitive fees and seeks to escape, the Indigenous
stands ground or, as Deborah Bird points out, "to get in the way of
settler colonization, all the native has to do is stay at home" (as
cited in Wolfe, 2006, p. 388). The ultimate goal of Indigenous refusal
is Indigenous resurgence; a struggle that includes but is not limited to
the return of Indigenous land. Again, while the aims may be diferent
(and in some sense competing), eforts toward the development of parallel
projects of co-resistance are possible through vigilant and sustained
engagement]{.underline}. [The "common ground" here is not necessarily
literal but rather conceptual, a corpus of shared ethics and analytics:
anti-capitalist, feminist, anti-colonial. Rather than allies, we are
accomplices---plotting the death but not murder of the settler
university]{.underline}. Toward this end, I ofer some additional
strategies for refusing the university: First and foremost, [we need to
commit to collectivity---to staging a refusal of the individualist
promise project of the settler state and its attendant institutions.
This requires that we engage in a radical and ongoing refexivity about
who we are and how we situate ourselves in the world]{.underline}. This
includes but is not limited to a refusal of the cycle of individualized
inducements---particularly, the awards, appointments, and grants that
require complicity or allegiance to institutions that continue to
oppress and dispossess. It is also a call to refuse the perceived
imperative to self-promote, to brand one's work and body. This includes
all the personal webpages, incessant Facebook updates, and Twitter feeds
featuring our latest accomplishments, publications, grants, rewards,
etc. etc. Just. Make. It. Stop. [The journey is not about self---which
means it is not about promotion and tenure---it is about the disruption
and dismantling of those structures and processes that create
hierarchies of individual worth and labor. Second, we must commit to
reciprocity---the kind that is primarily about being answerable to those
communities we claim as our own and those we claim to serve. It is about
being answerable to each other and our work.]{.underline} One of the
many things lost to the pressures of the publish-or-perish,
quantity-over-quality neoliberal regime is the loss of good critique. We
have come to confuse support with sycophantic praise and critical
evaluation with personal injury. Through the ethic of reciprocity, we
need to remind ourselves that accountability to the collective requires
a commitment to engage, extend, trouble, speak back to, and intensify
our words and deeds. Third, we need to commit to mutuality, which
implies reciprocity but is ultimately more encompassing. It is about the
development of social relations not contingent upon the imperatives of
capital---[that refuses exploitation at the same time as it radically
asserts connection,]{.underline} particularly to land. Inherent to a
land-based ethic is a commitment to slowness and to the arc of
inter-generational resurgence and transformation. One of the many ways
that the academy recapitulates colonial logics is through the
overvaluing of fast, new, young, and individualist voices and the
undervaluing of slow, elder, and collective ones. And in such a system,
relations and paradigms of connection, mutuality, and collectivity are
inevitably undermined. For Indigenous peoples, such begin and end with
land, centering questions of what it means to be a good relative. Toward
this end, I have been thinking a lot lately about the formation of a new
scholarly collective, one that writes and researches under a nom de
guerre---like the Black feminist scholars and activists who wrote under
and through the Combahee River Collective or the more recent collective
of scholars and activists publishing as "the uncertain commons."18 If
furthering the aims of insurgence and resurgence (and not individual
recognition) is what we hold paramount, then perhaps one of the most
radical refusals we can authorize is to work together as one; to enact a
kind of Zapatismo scholarship and a balaclava politics where the work of
the collectivity is intentionally structured to obscure and transcend
the single voice, body, and life[. Together we could write in refusal of
liberal, essentialist forms of identity politics, of individualist
inducements, of capitalist imperatives, and other productivist logics of
accumulation. This is what love as refusal looks like. It is the
un-demand, the un-desire to be either of or in the
university]{.underline}. It is the radical assertion to be on: land.
Decolonial love is land.

[Idle No More represents a powerful example of resistance to practices
of settler colonialism]{.underline}. It emerged in late 2012 as a
grassroots indigenous movement in opposition to the Canadian
government\'s various pieces of legislation that eroded environmental
protections and indigenous land and treaty rights. With the objective of
supporting resource extraction industries, the federal government had
pushed through various pieces of legislation without consultation. In
particular, the 2012 omnibus budget Bill C-45 contained a number of
provisions that would deeply alter the measures in place to protect the
environment from development and industry as well as the ownership of
reserve lands. Although it was one particular legislative act (Bill
C-45) that served to ignite the movement**[, Idle No More put forward a
much broader political agenda that was critical of a number of settler
colonial governance practices]{.underline}**. [At the center of the
movement is the notion of honoring existing treaties and the sharing of
resources based on an equal nation-to-nation relationship; this is
encapsulated in Idle No More\'s vision to \"honour Indigenous
sovereignty, and to protect the land and water\"]{.underline} (Idle No
More 2015b). The [decolonial politics put forth by Idle No More presents
a direct challenge to Canadian sovereignty, as a reestablishment of
nation-to-nation relations would have major material and immaterial
impacts on settler society]{.underline}. Idle No More began as a small
grassroots series of teach-ins held in Saskatchewan, but **[within a few
weeks the movement had spread throughout North America and was
characterized by hundreds of disruptive protest actions and solidarity
demonstrations]{.underline}**\--from flash-mob round dances and marches
to Parliament Hill in Ottawa to economic blockades of railroads,
highways, and international border crossings, to international
solidarity actions abroad. [The threat posed to the Canadian economy by
such disruptive actions caught the attention of the Canadian government
and its various policing and security agencies. The escalation of the
#IdlcNoMore hashtag on social media in December 2012 prompted AANDC to
pay close attention]{.underline}. Internal documents indicate the
department\'s concern on December 12: \"\[M\]aybe we should be
commissioning someone to monitor the social media around this more
systematically than we can do\" (AANDC 2012-01322, 13). (1) By late
December, AANDC had compiled an extensive report analyzing Idle No More
social media, tracking tens of thousands of tweets of the #Idle No More
hashtag between December 16 and 23, noting that \"[the hashtag has been
\'trending\' within Canada for the last few weeks]{.underline}\" (AANDC
2012-01322, 22). The report also mentions the 8,525 tweets calling on
Prime Minister Stephen Harper to meet with Attawapiskat Chief Teresa
Spence, who had been on hunger strike on Victoria Island in Ottawa since
December 11. Idle No More caught AANDC off guard, and AANDC\'s internal
reports emphasize the size of the movement. One AANDC document notes:
Organized and promoted through social media, [Idle No More has been able
to do something that other movements in the past have not been able to
do or manage to sustain**. It has people leaving their homes to
participate**]{.underline}. [More than 100 events have taken place in
Canada, including rallies, flash mob round dances, teach-ins and
blockades. Actions have been held in every province and
territory.]{.underline} (AANDC 2012-01322, 23) Despite having to
contextualize their assessment of the movement with the disparaging
remark that indigenous people usually do not \"leave their homes to
participate\" in demonstrations, **[these reports demonstrate the impact
of Idle No More and the subsequent reaction of the colonial
bureaucracy.]{.underline}** The report quoted above also includes both a
North American map of Idle No More\--related events and rallies and a
global map of tweet origins: The map demonstrates that the tweets are
not just coming from Canada, but worldwide. There are a number of
international \"hot spots\" on the map such as London, Cairo and Geneva
where there have been rallies in support of the movement. It has also
generated international press in papers such as The Guardian and Al
Jazeera. (AANDC 2012-01322,27)

Indigenous Environmental Studies & Sciences"\]//Mberhe

A well-known set of [Anishinaabe]{.underline} stories tells about one of
the stopping points of the migration: a land where food grows on water,
and a place where the people encountered wild rice for the first time
(manoomin/mnomen, translated as the good berry). Waterfowl showed the
people that wild rice is edible and guided them to habitats of low-lying
waters where wild rice grows best and different plants, animals, and
insects flourish. The people studied wild rice habitats as webs of
interdependent responsibilities. Ecologically, wild rice is responsible
for feeding humans, birds, and animals; for providing protective cover
for fish and birds; for supplying material for muskrat lodges; and for
supporting clean water. Water is responsible for giving life to wild
rice. The [people]{.underline} then [developed their own
responsibilities to harvest in ways that leave enough wild rice for
nonhumans]{.underline} and to work out diplomatic protocols for sharing
or respecting the wild rice beds needed by other human communities,
[thereby securing justice for all beings.]{.underline} They delegated
special responsibilities to women and certain clans to develop expert
knowledge of water quality and wild rice habitats and to provide
leadership to guide harvesting and habitat conservation.3 The people
created ceremonies that honor wild rice as a spiritual being because of
its significance within ecological webs of interdependent
responsibilities. Anishinaabe storytelling on migration and wild rice
tell us how the people adapted to new environments by developing moral
relationships, including responsibility, spirituality, and justice,
which are at the heart of how we understand resilience. [The massive
environmental changes imposed on Indigenous peoples by U.S. and Canadian
colonization and settlement include deforestation, draining wetlands,
damming, recreation, mining, commercial agriculture, shipping,
petrochemical and industrial manufacturing, and burning fossil fuels.
**Settlement affects ecosystems, including hydrological systems and
wetlands that support wild rice, that are crucial to Anishinaabe peoples
for exercising moral relationships.**]{.underline} From
nineteenth-century testimonies, we know that some of our ancestors were
particularly concerned that **[settlement was inflicting rapid and
harmful environmental changes on our peoples, which offset the
flourishing moral relationships that supported Anishinaabe
resilience.]{.underline}** [The history of Canadian and U.S. colonialism
can be read as the establishment of the conditions for their own
resilience in North America at the expense of Indigenous peoples'
resilience.]{.underline} Today, **[Anishinaabe peoples are leaders of
environmental movements that advocate for the continuance and renewal of
moral relationships of responsibility, spirituality, and
justice.]{.underline}** Anishinaabe grandmother Josephine Mandamin began
the Mother Earth Water Walk to motivate people to take responsibility
for clean water in the Great Lakes, honoring water's role as a sacred
life-giver. A coalition of Potawatomi, Ojibwe, and Menominee peoples
worked for years to stop the water pollution risks of the proposed
Crandon zinc and copper mine in Northeast Wisconsin, a mine seeking to
boost the settler economy at the expense of Indigenous peoples' health
and ways of life, including fishing and wild ricing. Five Odawa and
Ojibwe tribes in Michigan successfully resecured U.S. respect for the
rights that their ancestors stipulated in the 1836 Treaty of Washington
to protect future generations' capacity to exercise moral relationships
with fish, plants, and animals living off-reservation. The Shoal Lake 40
Ojibwe Nation, through the leadership of community members such as Daryl
Redsky, have worked to mitigate the impacts of Canadian settlers
sacrificing its water quality and land base for the sake of extracting
clean water for the city of Winnipeg. Anishinaabe nations, from the
Citizen Potawatomi Nation to the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa
Indians, are frontrunners in experimenting with renewable energy, such
as geothermal power, and green building standards. [Diverse
scholars]{.underline}, including Megan Bang, Leanne Simpson, Patty Loew,
Melissa Nelson, and Deborah McGregor, have [increased the awareness and
practice of Anishinaabe pedagogical philosophies, environmental values,
histories, and knowledge systems in the spheres of science, education,
public policy, and media. **Globally, nearly four hundred million
Indigenous peoples live on 22 percent of the world's land surface,
interacting with 80 percent of the planet's
biodiversity**]{.underline}.4 And they lead some of the most significant
environmental movements, educational programs, and research that seek to
protect humans' abilities to live respectfully within these diverse
ecosystems. The Whanganui Iwi (Aotearoa), for example, succeeded in
getting the New Zealand government to confer legal personhood on the
Whanganui River, which is ancestrally, spiritually, nutritionally, and
economically significant to the Iwi members. The College of Menominee
Nation founded its own Sustainable Development Institute in 1994, based
on the idea that sustainability has always been part of Menominee life,
including values such as "respect for the land, water, and air;
partnership with other creatures of earth; and a way of living and
working that achieves a balance between use and replenishment of all
resources."5 Quechua peoples of the Andes region, specifically the Paru
Paru, Chawaytiri, Sacaca, Pampallacta, Amaru, and Kuyo Grande
communities, have created the Potato Park, a biodiversity conservation
zone protecting over nine hundred varieties of native potato. The North
American Standing Rock Sioux Tribe recently energized one of the largest
Indigenous mass movements to stop the oil-transporting Dakota Access
Pipeline, publicizing their Mni Wiconi (water is life) philosophy as the
ground of their resistance. Indigenous scholars and activists, like
lawyer and professor Sarah Deer, are calling attention to the continued
abuses Indigenous peoples face, such as the exploitation of women and
children through sex trafficking at oil and gas industry worker camps in
the Bakken region of the United States at the hands of the extractive
industries that also contribute to pollution and climate change. And the
leaders of Indigenous environmental movements have sometimes paid the
ultimate sacrifice. In 2016, Berta Cáceres, a leader in the Lenca
people's movement to protect themselves from the risks of the Agua Zarca
Dam, was murdered in Honduras. Today, resilience is on everyone's mind.
**[Vulnerability to climate change, extreme weather events, biodiversity
loss, and food insecurity raise pressing concerns about the well-being
of human and nonhuman lives.]{.underline}** The World Health
Organization estimates that between 2030 and 2050, an additional 250,000
annual human deaths will be caused by climate change.6 **[Thousands of
species are either extinct or are in danger of extinction from habitat
destruction]{.underline}**.7 The Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network
estimates that 19 percent of the world's coral reefs are already lost.8
These are pressing challenges, but many human societies --like the
Anishinaabe peoples--have longstanding sciences, collective practices
(such as agriculture and ceremonies), arts, and philosophies that seek
to maintain moral relationships with ever-changing environments that
lessen harms and risks to humans and nonhumans alike.

\["Settler Colonialism, Ecology, and Environmental Justice"\]//Mberhe

ABSTRACT: [**Settler colonialism is a form of domination that violently
disrupts human relationships with the environment**. Settler colonialism
is ecological domination, committing environmental injustice against
Indigenous peoples and other groups.]{.underline} Focusing on the
context of Indigenous peoples' facing US domination, this article
investigates philosophically one dimension of how settler colonialism
commits environmental injustice. [When examined ecologically, settler
colonialism works strategically to undermine Indigenous peoples' social
resilience as self-determining collectives]{.underline}. To understand
the relationships connecting settler colonialism, environmental
injustice, and violence, the article first engages Anishinaabe
intellectual traditions to describe an Indigenous conception of social
resilience called collective continuance. [One way in which settler
colonial violence commits environmental injustice is through
strategically undermining Indigenous collective
continuance.]{.underline} At least two kinds of environmental injustices
demonstrate such violence: vicious sedimentation and insidious loops.
The article seeks to contribute to knowledge of how anti-Indigenous
settler colonialism and environmental injustice are connected. KEYWORDS:
anticolonialism, climate justice, decolonization, resilience,
resurgence,sustainability. Diverse persons, including scholars, writers
and activists, have described settler colonial domination as violence
that disrupts human relationships with the environment. Lee Maracle
writes that ["violence to earth and violence between humans are
connected]{.underline}" (2015: 53). Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang discuss
how "the disruption of Indigenous relationships to land represents a
profound epistemic, ontological, cosmological violence" (2012: 5).
Vanessa Watts claims that "the measure of colonial interaction with land
has historically been one of violence . . . where land is to be
accessed, not learned from or a part of " (2013: 26). The Women's Earth
Alliance and The Native Youth Sexual Health Network recently produced a
report entitled Violence on the Land, Violence on Our Bodies: Building
an Indigenous Response to Environmental Violence. The report states that
colonially supported extractive industries create "devastating impacts
of environmental violence" (WEA and NYSHN 2016). J.M. Bacon refers to
"colonial ecological violence" as a process of "disrupt\[ing\]
Indigenous eco-social relations" (2018: 1). I seek to investigate
philosophically one dimension of how settler colonialism commits
environmental injustice through the violent disruption of human
relationships to the environment. The dimension concerns how settler
colonialism works strategically to undermine Indigenous peoples' social
resilience as self-determining collectives. Engaging Anishinaabe
(Neshnabé) intellectual traditions, I will offer an Indigenous
conception of social resilience and self-determination that, for short,
I will call collective continuance. I will then show how settler
colonialism commits environmental injustice through strategically
undermining Indigenous collective continuance. Using this understanding
of environmental injustice, I will conclude by showing how **[settler
colonialism engenders at least two kinds of environmental injustices
against Indigenous peoples: (1) vicious sedimentation and (2) insidious
loops.]{.underline}** While my starting point of analysis is
anti-Indigenous violence that disrupts human relationships with the
environment, I am not attempting here to define absolutely what such
violence is or entails. I am also not trying to create the single theory
of environmental injustice that can somehow explain every wrongdoing.
The theory offered here in outline seeks only compatibility and
complementarity with a variety of other approaches to violence and
injustice that are well argued for across Indigenous studies and related
fields, such as settler colonial studies and critical environmental
justice studies. I will also isolate US settler colonial domination for
analytic purposes in this article, especially the oppressive
relationship between US settler populations and Indigenous populations.
The theory I will offer here should, when further elaborated elsewhere,
be able to connect to more complex, intersectional, and globally
integrated accounts of ecological domination within, before, and beyond
US settler colonialism.

### 2NC -- AT: Recognition solves

#### Government action based around the "recognition" of indigenous rights presupposes that the government has the ability to frame this rights discourse -- this assumption reinforces colonialism and cultural superiority

Yet [when we turn the 'recognition' debate toward indigenous peoples and
the desire to address colonial dispossession]{.underline}, [there is a
more fundamental problem than liberalism's traditional
individualism]{.underline}. Recognition via collective rights may offer
indigenous peoples a greater degree of equality in fact, and a degree of
cultural protection unattainable through pure individualism, **[but
beneath the veneer of such substantive liberal equality lie problematic
colonial assumptions]{.underline}**. There is a forceful argument, put
forward by many indigenous writers and post-colonial theorists like
Bhikhu Parekh, which asserts that [modern liberalism is founded on an
arrogant assertion of cultural superiority]{.underline}, for [whilst
Western value systems are far from perfect they are nonetheless afforded
normative priority.]{.underline} As Parekh (1998) observes, **[liberal
notions of justice and fairness are understood via the assertion of
universalised values, like liberal individualism, in contrast to the
supposedly backward, primitive societies that were 'enlightened' by
colonialism]{.underline}**. [Even those liberal and communitarian
writers who might be considered champions of minorities]{.underline},
like Taylor and Kymlicka, **[skip over the 'first step in questioning
the sovereignty of the authoritative traditions and institutions they
serve to legitimate']{.underline}** (Tully 1995: 53). [Such
writers,]{.underline} whilst recognising the importance of culture to
indigenous peoples, **[talk in terms of participation within liberal
institutions]{.underline}**, **[and their solutions to collective
disadvantage are framed in a liberal discourse of rights that has been
forced on indigenous peoples by colonialism]{.underline}**. Kymlicka,
for example, concedes that indigenous peoples' special relationship to
land is significant enough to justify recognition via the notion of
'group rights' and 'differentiated citizenship', but he exposes the
colonial underpinnings of such liberalism by denying indigenous peoples
full political autonomy. Cultural protection should be only available to
indigenous nations 'if, and in so far as, they are themselves governed
by liberal principles' (Kymlicka 1995: 153, my emphasis[). By presuming
the legitimacy of the liberal settler state's jurisdiction over
indigenous nations]{.underline}, **[such an approach presupposes exactly
what is in question]{.underline}** (see Tully 2000: 55).

At its June 1977 organizational meeting in Barrow, Alaska, the Inuit
Circumpolar Conference resolved \"that the Arctic shall be used for
peaceful and environmentally safe purposes only;\' and in 1983 resolved
further to oppose Arctic nuclear power stations and the mining of
nuclear minerals. A September 1985 [I.C.C. preparatory
conference]{.underline} at Montreal considered \"draft principles on the
peaceful use of the Arctic\" [calling for the complete demilitarization
of the Arctic under an international convention guaranteeing that it
\"never contribute to, or become a theatre of armed
conflict\"]{.underline} All these proposals will be reviewed at the
LC.C.\'s July 1986 meetings at Kotzebue, Alaska. [[I.C.C.]{.mark}
represents the indigenous majority of the Alaskan and Canadian Arctic
and newly-autonomous Greenland, [**enjoys consultative status** with the
U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations Economic and Social

[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[viewed denuclearization as a matter
of]{.underline}]{.mark} Inuit communities\' unique [[historical
responsibility]{.underline}]{.mark} for the Arctic environment.3
Regional disarmament proposals take on special meaning when linked with
a broadly-representative movement for regional autonomy. [General
Assembly Resolution 35/118]{.underline} of 11 December 1980 [calls on
Member States to [\"oppose all military activities]{.mark} and
arrangements [by colonial]{.mark} and occupying
[Powers]{.mark}\"]{.underline} in non-selfgoverning territories [[and

powers\' military facilities. **Demilitarization can be viewed**]{.mark}
not only as an important end in itself, but also **[as the first step
towards decolonization.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Arctic disarmament and self-determination. The political consequences of
[**an Inuit disarmament initiative could be substantial**.]{.underline}
[It would, at a minimum, serve as a unique symbol of regional identity
and national unity coming]{.underline}, altogether appropriately, from a
people whose history is exceptionally free from instances of armed
violence against others. If considered seriously by the United Nations
in the context of the disarmament process, [it would also amount to
defacto acknowledgment of Inuit self-determination - that is, their
right to determine their own future and the fate of the territory in
which they lives **States**]{.underline} can no longer acquire inhabited
territories except by purchase,73 and **[are obliged to refrain from
assisting states that occupy territories without the inhabitants\'
consent]{.underline}**.74 Although Canada has \"settled\" the status of
northern Quebec and the MacKenzie District by agreement, the central and
eastern Arctic and Labrador remain under negotiation, and U.S. title to
Alaska is based on 1971 legislation implemented without formal Inuit
consent. The United Nations approved the 1959 U.S. incorporation of
Alaska, previously considered a non-self-governing territory or colony,
but without being advised of the existence of an indigenous
population.75 The status of permanent sea ice poses special problems.
The U.S. insists on treating the entire Arctic Ocean as high seas open
to all nations, while both Canada and the U.S.S.R. view the ice as
subject to claim by adjacent states (under the \"sector principle\") and
to appropriation by occupation.76 Canada\'s strongest claim to polar sea
ice derives from Inuit use.77 Indeed, Canada based its previous
assertions of sovereignty over Arctic seas on the need to protect Inuit
hunting.78 Free navigation would threaten food species that live in the
ice (chiefly seals), and interfere with Inuit use of the ice as a
travelling surface.79 [An Inuit initiative could **force the United
Nations to take a closer look** at territorial claims]{.underline} in
the Arctic. Most non-aligned states will welcome an Arctic disarmament
declaration on principle, leaving the nuclear powers to object that
Inuit lack authority to make one. Inuit might point out that while they
do not enjoy full statehood, neither have they been democratically
incorporated into other states. They constitute either
non-self-governing territories administered by the U.S., U.S.S.R.,
Canada and Denmark, or states subject to an illegal, belligerent
occupation. As potential states (states in statu nascendi) [they enjoy
sufficient legal identity to take part in international
negotiations]{.underline}, in common with the PLO or SWAPO, for
instance.80 [Heightened international awareness of conflicting
territorial claims and their security implications **could lead to
establishment of a multilateral oversight council**]{.underline} for the
Arctic under a regional disarmament convention similar to the Antarctic
Treaty. [**This might strengthen Inuit autonomy by counterbalancing**
Canadian and American jurisdictional assertions.]{.underline}
Territorial claims could also be taken up by the United Nations Special
Committee on Decolonisation, or the Fourth Committee of the General
Assembly, leading to a multilateral oversight process similar to the
United Nations Trust Council for Namibia.

#### Empirical examples of this working

[Examples of regional disarmament. The 1920 multilateral treaty
accepting Norwegian sovereignty over Spitsbergen may be considered the
first modern case of regional disarmament.]{.underline} 10
Notwithstanding its control of the island, [Norway was \"not to create
or to allow the establishment of any naval base \... and not to
construct any fortification \... which may be used for warlike
purposes.\"]{.underline}» Norway also agreed to extend mining and
fishing privileges equally to the signatories. [The 1959 Antarctic
Treaty]{.underline} marking the conclusion of the International
Geophysical Year was somewhat more ambitious, [prohibiting \'any
measures of a military naturej\' including basing, maneuvers, and
weapons tests, as well as nuclear explosions and the disposal of
radioactive waste]{.underline}, above 60 degrees souths Military
personnel may be present in the region, but \"for peaceful purposes
only\" » All major nuclear powers ratified the treaty and appear to have
abided by it. 14 U.S. President Eisenhower suggested demilitarizing
outer space in 1957, but the U.S.S.R. contended this would give the
Americans, with their greater reliance on bombers, a strategic advantage
over the Soviet ICBM-based nuclear arsenal.15 The General Assembly
endorsed the suggestion that space be \"used for peaceful purposes
only,\"16 but the 1963 Outer Space Treaty, while incorporating the same
broad language as the Antarctic Treaty, demilitarized only \"the moon
and other celestial bodies\'\' Orbital or interplanetary space can be
used for military purposes except the deployment of \"nuclear weapons or
any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction\" 17 [In 1967 Latin
America became the first inhabited region to denuclearize. Bolivia,
Brazil, Chile and Ecuador first suggested a Latin American NFWZ in 1962,
reacting to the Cuban missile crisis,]{.underline} 18 [and the Treaty of
Tlatelolco was signed three years latear.]{.underline} 19 The testing,
acquisition, deployment, storage and use of nuclear weapons are
prohibited,20 excluding only nuclear explosions for \"peaceful
purposesl\'2\' Under an additional protocol ratified by the U.S.,
U.S.S.R., U.K., France and China, nuclear powers agreed to respect the
Treaty and to refrain from using or threatening the use of nuclear
weapons in the region.22 Eight Latin American states [subsequently
called for \"the effective limitation of (conventional) armaments\" as
well]{.underline}, \"and an end to their acquisition for offensive
purposesl \'23 Like the Antarctic and outer space treaties, the 1971
sea-bed treaty deals with newly-explored, uninhabited regions. An
offshoot of the law-of-the-sea programme, its language parallels the
outer space treaty, prohibiting the emplacement of \"nuclear weapons or
any other types of weapons of mass destruction;\' including carriers and
storage facilities, on the sea floor.24 Albeit of more symbolic than
real strategic significance, the sea-bed treaty has been widely accepted
and respected.25 At the suggestion of Sri Lanka, the 1970 Lusaka
conference of the Non-Aligned Countries called for the elimination of
\"Great Power rivalries\" from the Indian Ocean, and the following year
the General Assembly declared the Ocean, seafloor and airspace a
demilitarized \"zone of peace\"26 [Regional
denuclearization]{.underline} (at least) [has also been proposed by the
Organization of African Unity, some Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern
states, and the South Pacific Forum which includes Australia and New
Zetland.]{.underline}21 Most recently there has been growing interest in
a Nordic, or circumpolar NFWZ. Although Scandinavia has always been de
facto nuclear-free, Denmark, Norway and Iceland have reserved the right
to accept nuclear weapons in wartime.28 In 1957, the Soviet Union
suggested formalizing the region\'s nuclear-free status in notes to the
Norwegian and Danish governments.29 This was followed by Finnish
President Kekkonen\'s 1963 proposal for a Nordic NWFZ, and the idea has
continued to gain popularity despite several incidents involving Soviet
nuclear-armed submarines in Nordic territorial waters.3° Advocates of a
Nordic NWFZ argue that extending it to the entire area north of 60
degrees, with negotiated exceptions,31 would go beyond preserving the
Nordic status quo by requiring the removal of nuclear weapons from a
significant strategic area, reducing the risk of war.32 It would also
require the decommissioning, or transfer of control,33 of early-warning
systems. All previous regional measures have been designed to restrict
proliferation, rather than actually reduce existing forces.34

[Strategic analysts are devoting increasing attention to the possibility
of \"horizontal\" disarmament - that is, removing weapons from
particular regions as an alternative to reducing \"vertically\" the
number of weapons controlled by the nuclear powers.]{.underline} The
1978 [United Nations Special Session on Disarmament encouraged the
establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones]{.underline} (NWFZ) as a
prelude to global disarmament, and endorsed several regional
initiatives.4 Neighboring states share security interests, and the
nuclear powers are less directly affected.5 Regional consensus is most
likely in areas where nuclear armaments have not yet been deployed. The
principal objective of a NWFZ is detargetting. Posing no nuclear threat
to others, the argument goes, [a NWFZ is less likely to be viewed as a
nuclear target in time of war.]{.underline}6 [This reduces the arsenal
requirements of nuclear-weapon states, and allows the nuclear-free
states to redirect their financial resources to social and economic
development.]{.underline}7 It may also [contribute to \"confidence
building\" reducing the nuclear powers\' fear of attack, and creating
regional buffers that reduce the maneuverability and effectiveness of
nuclear forces.]{.underline}9 The objectives of complete
demilitarization (a \"zone of peace\") are essentially the same, but
restrictions include conventional as well as nuclear arms. The
effectiveness of establishing a NWFZ largely depends on \"negative
security guarantees\" by nuclear powers.9 It is not enough for the
region to dismantle (or refuse to accept) weapons; potential adversaries
must be persuaded to reciprocate. [This can include dismantling, moving,
or retargetting weapons originally aimed at the region, all of which is
more meaningful and verifiable than more assurances against the threat
or use of force.]{.underline}

1.3.2 Indigenous Engagement in the Uranium Industry [In recent years
there have been important developments]{.underline} in Canadian case law
dealing [with the Government's duty to consult indigenous peoples when
an action threatens to infringe or negatively affect a]{.underline}n
aboriginal [group's potential or established rights and
interests.]{.underline} Since corporations in the uranium industry can
and do suffer financial loss due to the government's inadequate
consultation, [corporations should take a more proactive role in the
consultation process and engage in a constructive process.]{.underline}
Canada's current framework for indigenous consultation, as discussed in
Aboriginal Consultation and Accommodation with its Updated Guidelines
for Federal Officials to Fulfill the Duty to Consult (AANDC)7 is
informed by Supreme Court decisions on aboriginal rights. While this
framework does not give indigenous people's veto power, [it does provide
a spectrum of required consultation according to the strength of the
aboriginal claim or right and the adverse impact of the
project.]{.underline} Although the government is responsible for
ensuring adequate consultation, they are not civilly liable to
corporations for financial losses due to inadequate consultation. Thus
project proponent corporations play an important role in carrying out
the procedural aspects of the consultation. In Chap. 10 Taymoor Pilehvar
provides helpful recommendations for corporate engagement which should
be driven by the objectives of facilitating the Crown's consultation
process and fostering good relations with Indigenous stakeholders.
[Corporations in the Uranium sector should adopt a policy that: (1)
includes good-faith engagement strategy with indigenous people; (2)
requires careful record keeping; (3) contemplates a broad range of
provisions that might be laid down in memoranda of understanding; and
(4) contemplates a broad range of mitigating measures, including
ecological and cultural impact, that might be included in an impact
benefit agreement. These best practises have the goal of recruiting
genuine indigenous support for the project]{.underline}, thereby
reducing the risk of corporate loss due to costly delays and/or
litigation.

### 2NC -- Solves Arms Sales

#### The root cause of harmful ideas of sale and ownership of property is from the will of the settler to acquire land and gain resources

Scholars of settler colonialism argue that it is a distinct form of
colonialism that needs to be theorized separately from colonialism more
generally. In contrast to classic colonialism whose aim is to take
advantage of resources that will benefit the metropole, [settler
colonialism's objective is to acquire land so that colonists can settle
permanently and form new communities]{.underline}. Lorenzo Veracini
(2011) compares the narrative arc of classic colonialism and settler
colonialism to the difference between a circle and a line. In classic
colonialism, the narrative, as in the Odyssey, takes a circular form,
"consisting of an outward movement followed by interaction with exotic
and colonized 'others' in foreign surroundings, and by a final return to
an original location" (p. 205). In contrast, "the narrative generally
associated with settler colonial enterprises rather resembles the
Aeneid, where the traveler moves forward along a story line that can't
be turned back" (p. 206). Settler colonists do not envision a return
home. Rather, they seek to transform the new colony into "home." The
differing goals of classic colonialism and settler colonialism lead to a
second major difference: their confrontation with indigenes. In classic
colonialism, the object is to exploit not only natural resources but
also human resources. Native inhabitants represent a cheap labor source
that can be harnessed to produce goods and extract materials for export
to the metropole. They also serve as consumers, expanding the market for
goods produced by the metropole and its other colonies. Goods and raw
materials, like colonists, follow a circular path in classic
colonialism. [In settler colonialism, the object is to acquire land and
to gain control of resources. To realize these ambitions, the first
thing that must be done is to eliminate the indigenous occupants of the
land. This can be accomplished in a variety of ways: genocide, forced
removal from territories desired by white settlers, and confinement to
reservations outside the boundaries of white settlement. It can also be
accomplished through assimilation. Assimilation can be
biological]{.underline} (e.g., through intermarriage to "dilute"
indigenous blood) [and/or cultural]{.underline} (e.g., by stripping
indigenes of their culture and replacing it with settler culture). [The
second thing that must be done is]{.underline} to [secure the
land]{.underline} for settlers. This can be accomplished by imposing a
modernist property regime that transforms land and resources (sometimes
including people) into "things" that can be owned. [This regime consists
of such elements as mapping and marking boundaries to delimit an object
that is to be owned, a system for recording ownership, and legal rules
for ownership and sale of objects defined as property.]{.underline}
Indigenous people generally understand the land and their relationship
to it very differently, viewing themselves as being provided for by the
land and in turn as living in harmony with the land and having a sense
of responsibility for its welfare. Settler society does not recognize
indigenous conceptions and from their own perspective of land as
property, views indigenes as failing to make productive use of it.

SR

[Colonization is violence. Colonization has had an impact on both
Indigenous women and men's roles in all relationships but Indigenous
women have taken the brunt of the impacts of colonization. Direct
attacks against Indigenous women are attempts to erase them from
existence so that there will be no future generations. These are attacks
against the future of our Indigenous nations. Indigenous women are now
dealing with the high statistics of violence against them and the
highest numbers of missing and murdered Indigenous women, not only in
Canada but also globally.]{.underline} Violence and abuse have occurred
in all societies and in all races of peoples, but the violence against
Indigenous women comes from colonization; our Indigenous women have
become the direct targets of colonial violence. This has saturated into
our communities and Indigenous women are now dealing with the violence
against them by Indigenous men and by non-Indigenous men. They are no
longer safe in their own communities. I have learned about not being
safe in my own home and community. I have learned what an abusive
relationship is. In an abusive relationship, the abuser feels the need
to have power and control. [When an abuser feels that his power and
control are taken away, he has to strike out at his most vulnerable
victim to regain that power and control. The victim loses her voice and
feels that she does not have any control of the situation at the time of
the abuse. I remember being silent and knowing that I could not say a
word to anyone about the abuse that was happening. I remember that
silence well. When an abusive relationship ends, the victim makes a
decision to take her power back]{.underline}. I remember saying that I
will no longer be beaten or abused -- not mentally, emotionally,
spiritually, physically or sexually. I remember saying that no one will
ever hurt me again. I acknowledged that I will no longer be a victim. I
had found my voice and regained respect for myself. As a survivor of
violence, I have learned not to blame anyone else but to take
responsibility for myself. I can celebrate my life and learn from the
lessons that I have learned. The abuser has an opportunity to learn that
he does not need to have that kind of power and control but can be an
equal and respectful partner. The relationship has to be a partnership.
[The abusive relationships that happen to our women are also born out in
the larger context of Canada's colonial relationship to Indigenous
peoples. Canada's colonial government has been an abuser since its
existence. First, it violated peace and friendship treaties, which were
based on nation-to-nation relationships, by unilaterally establishing
its government through legislation in which it had control over Indians
and lands reserved for Indians]{.underline} (ie. British North America
Act, 1867). This legislation then gave the government authority to
establish the most racist piece of legislation called the Indian Act.
These unilateral acts were the beginning of the abusive relationship. As
a result of generations of abuse and control, Indigenous peoples have
become victims in a long-standing abusive relationship and have been
silenced through the lack of control over lands and resources, the
genocidal policies of the residential school system, and the disrespect
and violence against Indigenous women. [The violence against women and
the violence occurring against Mother Earth are also directly
connected]{.underline}. Haudenosaunee planting ceremonies acknowledge
that the women are the seed -- the connection between the Creator and
Mother Earth. The loss of connection of Indigenous women to their lands
and territories means that the lifeblood and carrier of future
generations are also cut off. Since the existence of the patriarchal
Indian Act, there have been missing Indigenous women who were forcefully
displaced from their traditional territories for "marrying out". This
was the beginning of missing Indigenous women. The genocidal policies of
the Indian Act also had an impact on Indigenous governance systems where
the women's decision-making qualities were silenced and no longer part
of the balance of these systems. And we already know what the
residential schools did to our families, including the roles of mothers
and fathers and the losses of family bonding, and the loss of the most
basic tenets of a relationship: love and emotional well-being. In order
to become survivors of this abusive relationship, all victims, including
Indigenous men and women, must take their power back. Many have already.
This is what decolonization means at a very practical level -- taking
our power back. The language and actions about violence against
Indigenous women has to shift to actually begin the decolonization
process. What do I mean by shifting our language? It means that we have
to stop behaving and to stop talking like a victim. We have to stop
blaming the abuser and take responsibility for our own actions. [We have
to teach our next generations about healthy relationships, healthy
sexual relationships and how to treat each other with respect. We need
to practice our teachings by making a conscious choice about the
decisions that we make today and how each of those decisions have an
impact seven generations from now. I know my ancestors did that for me
seven generations ago. The decisions include how we teach our sons to
respect themselves and to be good men, to honour the women in their
lives, to honour their children, to be good fathers and good
grandfathers; the decisions to teach our daughters to respect themselves
and their bodies, to respect all of the relationships in their lives, to
know that they are the life givers and nurturers to the next
generations]{.underline}. Decolonization means bringing the safety back
and means living in a society where we feel safe and where we respect
each other as people. It means that our men are taking back their
rightful responsibilities to be the Warriors of our nations; to protect
the women and the children, and the lands they are all connected to, to
protect the lands for our future generations. [It means that our women
are taking back their rightful responsibilities to be respected
decision-makers, to carry and nurture life and to bring those future
generations into this physical world. It is the responsibility of all
generations (mothers, fathers, grandmothers and grandfathers) to ensure
that we maintain those connections to our lands and territories, with
our strong languages and ceremonies intact.]{.underline} Decolonization
means true partnerships, whether those partnerships are with Canada,
with our non-Indigenous allies, or between Indigenous men and women.
[Decolonization means that we celebrate our resiliency in the face of an
abusive relationship and choose different relationships that honor
ourselves, our communities, our women, and our lands.]{.underline}

#### Decolonization is a prerequisite to understanding the problems and methods of sexism

[If we successfully decolonize, the argument goes, then we will
necessarily eliminate problems of sexism as well. This sentiment can be
found in the words of Ward Churchill. He contends that all struggles
against sexism are of secondary importance because, traditionally,
sexism did not exist in Indian nations]{.underline}. Churchill asks
whether sexism exists in Indian country after Native peoples have
attained sovereignty? His reply, \"Ask Wilma Mankiller,\" former
principal chief of the Cherokee Nation.5 Well, let\'s ask Mankiller. She
says of her election campaign for deputy chief that she thought people
might be bothered by her progressive politics and her activist
background. \"But I was wrong,\" she says: No one challenged me on the
issues, not once. Instead, I was challenged mostly because of one fact-I
am female. The election became an issue of gender. It was one of the
first times I had ever really encountered overt sexism . .. (people)
said having a female run our tribe would make the Cherokees the laughing
stock of the tribal world.6 Regardless of its origins in Native
communities, then, sexism operates with full force today and requires
strategies that directly address it. Before Native peoples fight for the
future of their nations, they must ask them selves, who is included in
the nation? It is often the case that gender justice is often
articulated as being a separate issue from issues of survival for
indigenous peoples. [Such an understanding presupposes that we could
actually decolonize without addressing sexism, which ignores the fact
that it has been precisely through gender violence that we have lost our
lands in the first place]{.underline}.7 In my activist work, I have
often heard the sentiment expressed in Indian country: we do not have
time to address sexual/ domestic violence in our communities because we
have to work on \"sur vival\" issues first. However, Indian women suffer
death rates because of domestic violence twice as high as any other
group of women in this This content downloaded from 141.211.4.224 on

https://about.jstor.org/terms 122 Andrea Smith country.8 They are
clearly not surviving as long as issues of gender vio lence go
unaddressed. Scholarly analyses of the impact of colonization on Native
communities often minimize the histories of oppression of Native women.
In fact, many scholars argue that men were disproportionately affected
by colonization because the economic systems imposed on Native nations
deprived men of their economic roles in the communities more so than
women.9 By narrowing our analyses solely to the explicitly eco nomic
realm of society, we fail to account for the multiple ways women have
disproportionately suffered under colonization-from sexual violence to
forced sterilization. [As Paula Gunn Allen argues: Many people believe
that Indian men have suffered more damage to their traditional status
than have Indian women, but I think that belief is more a reflection of
colonial attitudes toward the primacy of male experience than of
historical fact. While women still play the traditional role of
housekeeper, childbearer, and nurturer, they no longer enjoy the
unquestioned positions of power, respect, and decision making on local
and international levels that were not so long ago their accustomed
functions.10 This tendency to separate the health and well-being of
women from the health and well-being of our nations is critiqued in
Winona LaDuke\'s 1994 call to not \"cheapen sovereignty.\" She discusses
attempts by men in her community to use the rhetoric of \"sovereignty\"
to avoid paying child sup port payments.]{.underline} What is the point
of an Indian Child Welfare Act when there is so much disregard for the
rights and well being of the children? Some of these guys from White
Earth are saying the state has no jurisdiction to exact child support
payments from them. Traditionally, Native men took care of their own. Do
they pay their own to these women? I don\'t think so. I know better. How
does that equation better the lives of our children? How is that (real)
sovereignty? [The U.S. government is so hypocritical about recognizing
sovereignty. And we, the Native community, fall into the same hypocrisy.
I would argue the Feds only recognize Indian sovereignty when a first
Nation has a casino or a waste dump, not when a tribal government seeks
to preserve ground water from pesticide contamination, exercise
jurisdiction over air quality, or stop clear-cutting or say no to a
nuclear dump.]{.underline}

#### Native feminist theory is key to understanding governmental structures; this is a prerequisite before addressing global issues 

**Smith 2005** (Andrea Smith, Native American Feminism, Sovereignty, and
Social Change , Andrea Smith is associate professor in the Department of
Media and Cultural Studies at the University of California, Riverside,
Spring 2005, Feminist Studies, Vol. 31, No. 1, pp. 128-129,

[Native feminist theory and politics as a whole by questioning the
legitimacy of the United States specifically and the nation-state as the
appropriate form of governance generally. Progressive activists and
scholars, although prepared to make critiques of the U.S. government,
are often not prepared to question its legitimacy.]{.underline} A case
in point is the strategy of many racial justice organizations in the
United States to rally against hate crimes resulting from the attacks of
9/11 under the banner, \"We\'re American too.\" However, [what the
analysis of Native women activists suggests is that this implicit
allegiance to \"America\" legitimizes the genocide and colonization of
Native peoples, as there could be no \"America\" without this genocide.
Thus by making anticolonial struggle central to feminist politics,
Native women make central to their organizing the question of what is
the appropriate form of governance for the world in
general.]{.underline} Does self-determination for indigenous peoples
equal aspirations for a nation-state, or are there other forms of
governance we can create that are not based on domination and control?
[Questioning the United States, in particular, and questioning the
nation state as the appropriate form of governance for the world, in
general, allow us to free our political imagination to begin thinking of
how we can begin to build a world we would actually want to live in.
Such a political project is particularly important for colonized peoples
seeking national liberation because it allows us to differentiate
\"nation\" from \"nation state.\"]{.underline} Helpful in this project
of imagination is [the work of Native women activists who have begun
articulating notions of nation and sovereignty that are separate from
nation-states. Whereas nation-states are governed through domination and
coercion, indigenous sovereignty and nation hood is predicated on
interrelatedness and responsibility]{.underline}. As Crystal Ecohawk
states: Sovereignty is an active, living process within this knot of
human, material and spiritual relationships bound together by mutual
responsibilities and obligations. From that knot of relationships is
born our histories, our identity, the traditional ways in which we
govern ourselves, our beliefs, our relationship to the land, and how we
feed, clothe, house and take care of our families, communities and
Nations.\"9 [This interconnectedness exists not only among the nation\'s
members but among all creation-human and nonhuman. As Sharon Venne
states: Our spirituality and our responsibilities define our duties. We
understand the concept of sovereignty as woven through a fabric that
encompasses our spiritual ity and responsibility. This is a cyclical
view of sovereignty, incorporating it into our traditional philosophy
and view of our responsibilities. There it differs greatly from the
concept of western sovereignty which is based upon absolute
power.]{.underline} For us absolute power is in the Creator and the
natural order of all living things; not only in human beings\.... Our
sovereignty is related to our connections to the earth and is inherent.
The idea of a nation did not simply apply to human beings. We call the
buffalo or the wolves, the fish, the trees, and all are nations. Each is
sovereign, an equal part of the creation, interdependent, interwoven,
and all related.20 These models of sovereignty are not based on a narrow
definition of nation that would entail a closely bounded community and
ethnic cleansing. For example, one activist distinguishes between a
chauvinistic notion of \"nationalism\" versus a flexible notion of
\"sovereignty\": Nationalism is saying, our way is the only right
way\.... I think a real true sovereignty is a real, true acceptance of
who and what\'s around you. And the nationalist doesn\'t accept all
that\.... [Sovereignty is what you do and what you are to your own
people within your own confines, but there is a realization and
acceptance that there are others who are around you. And that happened
even before the Europeans came, we knew about the Indians. We had
alliances with some, and fights with some. Part of that sovereignty was
that acceptance that they were there.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- State must go

#### As long as the state exists, settler hegemony persists -- only dismantling the structures of society can result in fundamental change

Settler Hegemony, and the Japanese in Hawai'I." August 2004.

Although many American citizens are critical of the US government on its
environmental, human rights, or military policies, most believe the
United States remains the best country in the world. In other words,
these [settlers accept American imperialism and settler
hegemony]{.underline}. Some of the American policies need reforming. But
while these reform efforts need to pursued, [there is a vast difference
between repairing/ reforming a state and overturning it.]{.underline}
Put in another way, **[there is a fundamental distinction reconstituting
settler hegemony and ending it.]{.underline}** Lenin clarifies this
distinction when he observes that the \"proletariat fights for the
revolutionary overthrow of the imperialist bourgeoisie\" while \"the
petty bourgeoisie fights for the reformist \'improvement\' 160 of
imperialism, for adaptation and submission to it.\" [If one is against
American imperialism yet believes reforms can end the American predatory
policies and culture]{.underline}, **[then one does not understand the
vast scope of hegemony with its interlocking governmental and societal
structures.]{.underline}** As Lenin aptly put it, supporting reform is
working for solutions within (\"improvements of\") the colonial
structure and not dismantling it. [In order to seek fundamental change
in society, the existing hegemony must be abolished]{.underline}. For
Lenin, hegemony is the power vested in public institutions that uphold
the ruling class and its interests. [Changing political actors,
improving policies, or restructuring certain public agencies does not
change the domination of the ruling class]{.underline}. **[Revolutionary
change in state power means creating new political, economic, and social
structures]{.underline}**. If hegemony is not understood, Lenin warns,
whatever state structure is envisioned will remain within the
\"boundaries of bourgeois reasoning and politics.\"

Facing assertive indigenous presences within settler colonial spaces,
[settlers must answer the legitimate charge that **their daily life --
in all its banality -- is predicated upon the privileges produced by
ongoing genocide**]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} [jarring nature of
such charges offers an irreconcilable challenge to settlers qua
settlers.]{.underline}64 Should these charges become impossible to
ignore, [they threaten to explode the imago of settler colonialism,
which had hitherto operated within the settler psyche in a relatively
smooth and benign manner]{.underline}. [This explosion is potentiated by
the revelation of even a portion of the violence that is required to
make settler life possible.]{.underline} If, for example, settlers are
forced to see 'their' beach as a site of murder and ongoing
colonization, it becomes more difficult to sustain it within the
imaginary as a site of frivolity.65 As Brown writes, in the 'loss of
horizons, order, and identity' the subject experiences a sense of
enormous vulnerability.66 Threatened with this 'loss of containment\',
the settler subject embarks down the road to psychosis.67 Thus, to
parlay Brown\'s thesis to the settler colonial context, the
uncontrollable rage that indigenous presences induce within the settler
is not evidence of the strength of settlers, but rather of a subject
lashing out on the brink of its own dissolution. [This panic -- this
rabid and insatiable anger -- is always already at the core of the
settler as a subject]{.underline}. As Lorenzo Veracini observes, the
settler necessarily remains in a disposition of aggression 'even after
indigenous alterities have ceased to be threatening\'.68 [This
disposition results from the precarity inherent in the maintenance of
settler colonialism\'s imago, wherein any and all indigenous presences
threaten subjective dissolution of the settler as such]{.underline}.
Trapped in a Gordian Knot, the very thing that provides a balm to the
settler subject -- further development and entrenchment of the settler
colonial imago -- is also what panics the subject when it is inevitably
contravened.69 We might think of this as a process of hardening that
leaves the imago brittle and more susceptible to breakage. [Their desire
to produce a firm imago means that settlers are also always already in a
psychically defensive position -- that is, the settler\'s offensive
position on occupied land is sustained through a defensive posture. For
while settlers desire the total erasure of indigenous populations, the
attendant desire to disappear their own identity as settlers
necessitates the suppression of both desires, if the subject\'s reliance
on settler colonial power structure is to be psychically
naturalized.]{.underline} Settlers' reactions to indigenous peoples fit,
almost universally, with the two ego defense responses that Sigmund
Freud observed. The first of these defenses is to attempt a complete
conversion of the suppressed desire into a new idea. **[In settler
colonial contexts, this requires averting attention from the violence of
dispossession]{.underline}**; [as such, settlers often suggest that they
aim to create a 'city on the hill']{.underline}.70 Freud noted that the
conversion defense mechanism does suppress the anxiety-inducing desire,
but it also leads to 'periodic hysterical outbursts\'. [Such is the case
when settlers' utopic visions are forced to confront the reality that
the gentile community they imagine is founded in and perpetuates
irredeemable suffering]{.underline}. A second type of defense is to
channel the original desire\'s energy into an obsession or a phobia. The
effects of this defense are seen in the preoccupation that settler
colonialism has with purity of blood or of community.71 As we have
already seen, [this obsession at once solidifies the power of the
settler state, thereby naturalizing the settler and simultaneously
perpetuating the processes of erasing indigenous peoples.]{.underline}
Psychic defenses are intended to secure the subject from pain, and
whether that pain originates inside or outside the psyche is
inconsequential. [Because of the threat that indigeneity presents to the
phantasmatic wholeness of settler colonialism, settlers must always
remain suspended in a state of arrested development between these
defensive positions]{.underline}. Despite any pretensions to the
contrary, the settler is necessarily a parochial subject who
continuously coils, reacts, disavows, and lashes out, when confronted
with his dependency on indigenous peoples and their territory. This
psychic precarity exists at the core of the settler subject because of
the unending fear of its own dissolution, should indigenous sovereignty
be recognized.72 Goeman writes as an explicit challenge to other
indigenous peoples, but this holds true to settler-allies as well, that
**[decolonization must include an analysis of the dominant
'self-disciplining colonial subject']{.underline}**.73 However, as this
discussion of subjective precarity demonstrates, the degree of to which
these disciplinary or phenomenological processes are complete should not
be overstated. For [settler-allies must also examine and cultivate the
ways in which settler subjects fail to be totally
disciplined.]{.underline} Evidence of [**this incompletion** is apparent
in the subject\'s arrested state of development. Discovering **the
instability at the core of the settler subject,**]{.underline} indeed of
all subjects, is the central conceit of psychoanalysis. This exception
of at least partial failure to fully subjectivize the settler is also
what sets my account apart from [Rifkin\'s. His phenomenology falls into
the trap]{.underline} that Jacqueline Rose observes within many
sociological accounts of the subject: [that of assuming a successful
internalization of norms. From the psychoanalytical perspective, the
'unconscious constantly reveals the "failure"' of
internalization.]{.underline}74 As we have seen, [within settler
subjects]{.underline} this can be expressed as [an irrational
anxiety]{.underline} that expr[esses itself whenever a settler is
confronted with the facts regarding their colonizing
status]{.underline}. Under conditions of total subjectification, such
charges ought to be unintelligible to the settler. Thus, **[the process
of subject formation is always in slippage and never totalized as others
might suggest]{.underline}**.75 Because of this precarity, the settler
subject is prone to violence and lashing out; but [the subject in
slippage also provides an avenue by which the process of settler
colonialism can be subverted]{.underline} -- [creating cracks in a
phantasmatic wholeness which can be opened wider]{.underline}.
[Breakages of this sort offer an opportunity]{.underline} to pursue what
Paulette Regan calls a 'restorying' of settler colonial history and
culture, **[to decenter settler mythologies built upon and within the
dispossession of indigenous peoples]{.underline}**.**[76 The cultivation
of these cracks is a necessary part of decolonizing work]{.underline}**,
[as it continues to panic and thus to destabilize settler
subjects.]{.underline} [Resistance to settler colonialism does not occur
only in highly visible moments]{.underline} like the famous conflict at
Kanesatake and Kahnawake,77 **[it also occurs in reiterative and
disruptive practices, presences, and speech acts.]{.underline}** Goeman
correctly observes that [the 'repetitive practices of everyday life' are
what give settler spaces their meaning, as they provide a degree of
naturalness to the settler imago and its psychic
investments]{.underline}.78 As such, to **[disrupt the ease of these
repetitions is at once to striate radically the otherwise smooth spaces
of settler colonialism and also to disrupt the easy (re)production of
the settler subject.]{.underline}** Goeman calls [these subversive acts
the 'micro-politics of resistance\']{.underline}, which historically
took the form of 'moving fences, not cooperating with census
enumerators, sometimes disrupting survey parties' amongst other
process.79 These acts panic the subject that is disciplined as a product
of settler colonial power, by forcing encounters with the sovereign
indigenous peoples that were imagined to be gone. This [reveals to the
settler, if only fleetingly, the violence that founds and sustains the
settler colonial relationship. While such practices may not overthrow
the settler colonial system, they do **subvert its logics by insistently
drawing attention to the ongoing presence of indigenous peoples who
refuse erasure.**]{.underline}

Introduction, pp. 13-16, jwm)

Losing Patience for the Task of Convincing Settlers to Pay Attention to
Indigenous Ideas---Eve Tuck Learning from Linda Tuhiwai Smith's work,
much of my writing has expressed some impatience with regard to research
practices on Indigenous peoples. [I have been critical of
damage-centered research]{.underline} (Tuck, 2009), which [focuses
solely on the supposed damage of Indigenous people in the supposed
aftermath of colonization (supposed because settler colonialism
continues to violently shape Indigenous life]{.underline}). I have also
written with Wayne (Tuck & Yang, 2012) to critique superficial, additive
employs of the term decolonization in education discourse, and have
argued for using the term with specificity, not just as an emptied
synonym for whatever project someone was already wanting to make happen.
To say that [decolonization is not a metaphor is to resist using
decolonization as a trendy term, and in settler colonial contexts, to
resist delinking decolonial projects from the rematriation of Indigenous
land and life.]{.underline} [In settler states that are also
antiblack]{.underline} states founded through the violence of chattel
slavery, [decolonization also must involve abolition]{.underline}. So,
I'm somewhat used to expressing impatience in my work, but more
recently, [I have become frustrated by the way that Indigenous
scholarship is taken up in the settler academy]{.underline}. For most of
my career, I have advocated for the centrality of Indigenous social
thought in fields of education. Most of my interventions have focused on
the possibilities afforded by attending to Indigenous writings,
worldviews, teachings, approaches to relationship, ethics, histories,
and futurities. I have done this because [I am convinced that Indigenous
texts, for the most part, do the work to teach readers how these texts
need to be read.]{.underline} One extended analogy that I have made to
describe the relationship between Indigenous social thought and Western
theory is that of the New York City subway system. I was a New Yorker
for much of my adult life, and I hold the NYC subway system in high
regard (note I am describing the network of tracks, not necessarily the
company that runs the trains!). A map of the criss-crossing routes is
something to behold. Trains go all over the city, taking one below
rivers, beneath stone and skyscrapers, above avenues and through the
most sacred parts of the city. Subway lines route from this corner to
that corner, from this neighborhood to that beach. Entryways from the
street are well marked, often with a glowing green ball, or one that
glows red to convey that it is closed for now. Signs from the street
indicate "downtown only," or "uptown only," and where a train will go to
(and not go to) is clearly marked on the platforms. For me, thinking of
this underground world of connectivity and travel and hubs and pathways
is a good way to think about Indigenous knowledges. Indigenous
knowledges have many of these characteristics and are also usually
sign-posted---this will take you in this direction, but not in this
direction. This is open for you now. This is how you get to your
destination, but this is also how you get to other destinations. To
extend this analogy, sometimes listening to a person who is trying to
understand something only by engaging Western theory is like listening
to a person who keeps trying to take a taxi cab in rush-hour traffic.
They complain about getting stuck, the slow ride, the cost of the trip.
Being an Indigenous scholar in the settler academy is like listening to
someone go on and on about the dilemmas of cab rides while knowing that
the subway system is just beneath the surface. Again, I feel that I have
spent much of my time in education encouraging people to take just a
short journey on a subway, or at least check out a map. I feel that I
have been standing at the subway entrance, calling to colleagues and
students as they hop in their individual taxi cabs into gridlock
traffic. I find myself less willing to do this now. I am [weary after so
many conference presentations in which Indigenous scholars present work
and then someone in the audience asks them a question that expects them
to do more work.]{.underline} When I was in graduate school, I hated
conference presentations because [no matter how carefully I articulated
my project, there was always someone in the audience who wanted me to do
more labor for them; either tell them what they can do or help them see
how they can save all the "Indian" children.]{.underline} In most cases,
[this question was posed even if my presentation critiqued the ways in
which white settlers make their experiences the center of life and
work]{.underline}. Now, especially when I am serving as chair or
discussant on panels with new Indigenous scholars, [I warn audiences
away from asking self-serving questions or questions that make
Indigenous scholars create honey-do lists for settlers]{.underline}.
There have been several "turns," including the ontological turn, the
material turn, the spatial turn, each of which is actually a turn to
where Indigenous people have always been (see also Tuck & McKenzie,
2015). I [recently became totally exasperated when I saw a social media
post by a white settler colleague **asking for recommendations of "more
practical" readings by Indigenous scholars, which would provide more
detail about what decolonization looks like "in reality.**]{.underline}"
To watch [settler scholars sift through our work as they effectively
ask, "Isn't there more for me to get from this?" is so
insulting]{.underline}. It seems like [the tacit (and sometimes
arrogantly explicit) request for more (details, explanation, assurance)
is actually a form of dismissal]{.underline}. It is a rejection of the
opportunity to engage with Indigenous texts on their own terms. It [is a
deferral of responsibility through asking]{.underline}, "**[Isn't there
something less theoretical? Isn't there something more theoretical?
Something more practical? Something less radical? Can't you describe
something that seems more likely or possible?]{.underline}**" [These
insistences upon Indigenous writings contradict themselves while also
putting all the onus of responsibility on Indigenous people to make the
future more coherent and palatable to white settler
readers**.**]{.underline} In reading Indigenous work, they ask for more
work, even if they have done little to fully consider what has already
been carefully and attentively offered. Often it seems that settler
readers read like settlers (that is, read extractively) for particular
content to be removed for future use. The reading is like panning for
gold, sorting through work that may not have been intended for a
particular reader, sorting it by what is useful and what is discardable.
Again, [something being purportedly too theoretical is often the reason
that Indigenous work is discarded or disregarded, whereas that "too
theoretical" idea may be entirely practical, lifesustaining, and
life-promoting for an Indigenous reader]{.underline}. I spent almost all
my career, up until recently, believing that if white settlers would
just read Indigenous authors, this would move projects of Indigenous
sovereignty and land rematriation in meaningful ways. I underestimated
how people would read Indigenous work extractively, for discovery. I
underestimated how challenging it would be for settlers to read
Indigenous work, after all these years of colonial relations.
[Indigenous and decolonial theories are unfairly, inappropriately
expected to answer to whiteness and to settler relationships to land in
the future.]{.underline} At the end of Decolonization is Not a Metaphor,
Wayne and I write about the importance of incommensurability. We write
that **[incommensurability is an ethic that contests
reconciliation---reconciliation is about rescuing settler normalcy,
about ensuring a settler future. A settler future is preoccupied by
questions of, What will decolonization look like? What will happen after
abolition? What will be the consequences of decolonization for the
settler?]{.underline}** Wayne and I close the article with the
insistence that decolonization is not obliged to answer questions
concerned with settler futures. "[Decolonization is not accountable to
settlers, or settler futurity. Decolonization is accountable to
Indigenous sovereignty and futurity]{.underline}. The answers to those
questions are not fully in view" (Tuck & Yang, 2012, p. 35). What I am
coming to more fully understand is that [the questions of "What will
decolonization look like?," when posed by settlers, are a distraction to
Indigenous theorizations of decolonization.]{.underline} They **[drain
the energy and imagination of Indigenous scholarship---they pester, they
think they are unique, and they are boring.]{.underline}** I want time
and space to sketch the next and the now to get there. [Decolonization
is not the endgame, not the final outcome of a long process, but the
next now, the now that is chasing at our heels]{.underline}. I am lucky
to come from the long view.

This article has referred thus far to recognition and nonrecognition
without properly clarifying what authentic recognition might look like.
To do this, I will here define [recognition as being either in "bad
faith" or in "good faith]{.underline}". Popularised in the work of
French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, ["bad faith" is considered as a
form of active deception]{.underline}, as lying to oneself.20 In this
sense, it is an escape from what Sartre considers to be the 'choice' of
freedom. Recognition in bad faith suppresses the point of rupture as a
means of reconciling combative struggle. It [depends on being recognized
on the terms of the oppressor, and thus recognition in "bad faith" is a
"choice" against a break with the systems of power.]{.underline} Drawing
on both Sartre and Fanon, Lewis Gordon argues that from the existential
phenomenological standpoint, freedom and humanity are regarded as one.
Since [freedom and human being are regarded as one, we can translate bad
faith into]{.underline} more prosaic language as the effort to hide from
human beings. The effort to hide from human beings takes at least two
forms[: rejection of the humanity in others and rejection of the
humanity in oneself]{.underline}.21 Gordon's definition helps to
establish a [politics of recognition]{.underline} in bad faith as
[a]{.underline} ["rejection of humanity" in oneself and
others]{.underline}. In contrast, the concept of recognition in good
faith relies on nonrecognition and therefore rupture. **[Good faith
requires a complete break with the systems that have birthed oppression,
and allows for the reinstatement of humanity to both colonized peoples
and the victims of history]{.underline}**---the subjects of Fanon and
Benjamin's concerns, respectively. [Rupture, as they key to recognition
"good faith," characterizes moments of combative struggle within
dialectical analysis]{.underline}. Fanon and Benjamin both identify in
such [rupture the quality of being 'suspended' in history and locked in
time]{.underline}; that is to say, each envisions dialectics at a
standstill. [Rupture acts here as a marker of weakness within the linear
thread of material history]{.underline}, providing the vantage point
from which transformation may be pushed forth. [Good faith therefore has
a temporal dimension---it arrests historical narrative, while bad faith
succumbs to it.]{.underline} In this context, let's re-examine Fanon's
treatment of rupture. For Fanon, recognition in good faith is a
politicized phenomenon, given that a material situation governs one's
capacity to realise one's freedom. Rupture exists as an active,
combative tension at the centre of a contradiction of forces, but can be
trapped at the points where its realization is suppressed. But Fanon's
understanding is such that [colonialism induces a dialectical stasis
that renders rupture immobile]{.underline}. To this extent, there is a
temporal dimension latent within Fanon's treatment of rupture.
[Recognition in bad faith follows a logic of substitution]{.underline}.
In The Wretched of the Earth, this theme is developed in Fanon's
warnings against neocolonialism. The period post-independence in an
anti-colonial struggle, he cautions, carries with it the risk of the
"native" bourgeoisie substituting itself in the gap left by the former
settler colonial bourgeoisie: "there is no native who does not dream at
least once a day of setting himself up in the settler's place."22 The
logic of substitution helps to determine the way in which the colonial
world is "a motionless, Manichaean world,"23 and for this reason, Fanon
warns that "independence ... is not a word which can be used as an
exorcism."24 In this way, Fanon reaches the following conclusion: The
[immobility to which the native is condemned can only be called into
question if the native decides to put an end to the history of
colonization---the history of pillage---and to bring into existence the
history of the nation---the history of decolonization]{.underline}.25
[Decolonization]{.underline} for Fanon is synonymous with a dialectical
movement of history and [must follow the "dialectical requirement" of
rupture if recognition in good faith is to be achieved]{.underline}.26
Without rupture, dialectics are at a stand-still: "Today, we are at
present at the stasis of Europe. Comrades, let us free from this
motionless movement where gradually dialectic is changing to the logic
of equilibrium."27 [Focusing on the content of rupture, Fanon turns to
revolutionary violence.]{.underline} Fanon's opening discussion of The
Wretched of the Earth emphasises that "[violence is a cleansing force.
It frees the native from]{.underline} his [interiority complex and
from]{.underline} his [despair and inaction; it makes him fearless and
restores]{.underline} his [self-respect]{.underline}."28 He means, of
course, **[violence to the structure of colonialism]{.underline}**. This
conception of [violence frees colonized subjects from the dialectical
stasis to which racism has confined them, acting as a medium through
which rupture functions]{.underline}. Fanon's notion of violence serves
the same purpose of reinvigorating dialectical movement through the
formation of collective bonds: "the practice of [violence binds
\[colonized subjects\] together as a whole, since each individual forms
a violent link in the great chain, a part of the great organism of
violence which has surged upwards in reaction to the settler's violence
in the beginning]{.underline}."29 **[Collective violence acts here with
a rehabilitative dimension, building solidarity and a sense of national
consciousness in opposing the colonial enemy as a nation]{.underline}**.
Violence that gives way to a national movement derives its strength by
totalising the "weaker" efforts toward liberation that came before it,
and asserts itself as combative struggle in the face of its passive
counterpart of recognition in bad faith. In this context, Fanon's
discussion on violence highlights the importance in privileging rupture,
and the movement of history through rupture, within dialectical
analysis. Furthermore, Fanon argues that a radical multiplicity of
ruptures might emerge from the same historical dialectic, which
distinguishes his thought clearly from progressive discourses
(especially those inspired by Marxist-Leninism) that suppose a linearity
of "revolutionary" struggle. This is made possible through the method by
which Fanon reconsiders Hegel's master/slave dialectic, and by his
demand to move away from the epistemologies and institutions established
by an imperial Europe. This new history must be on the terms of what, at
the time of Fanon's writing, was described as "the Third World": "if we
want humanity to advance a step farther, if we want to bring it up to a
different level than that which Europe has shown it, then we must invent
and we must make discoveries."30 This is written as a warning to not
follow in the wake of Europe, which leaves behind it "an avalanche of
murders."31 We can now consider similarities and differences between
Fanon's and Benjamin's accounts of rupture and recognition in good
faith. If rupture is a moment of tension built from the contradictions
that inform it, then for Benjamin, the essence of rupture within history
is understood in the following way: "where we see the appearance of a
chain of events, he \[the Angel of History\] sees one single
catastrophe, which unceasingly piles rubble on top of rubble and hurls
it before his feet."32 Returning to the idea of dialectics at a
standstill, dialectical movement for Benjamin is frozen on the grounds
that the rupture is only seen by the Angel of History, as rupture is
suppressed by means of the myth of progress. Regarding the notion of
revolutionary agency in Fanon, Benjamin offers an equally powerful
emphasis on pushing the point of rupture to its absolute breaking point:
Marx said that revolutions are the locomotive of world history. But
perhaps things are very different. It may be that revolutions are the
act by which the human race travelling in the train applies the
emergency brake.33 To extend the metaphor, the train does not move
dialectically, but is trapped in a movement that renders its movement
neither forwards nor backwards. The emergency break to which Benjamin
refers is the moment at which the rupture suppressed can no longer
maintain its hold. At this point, rupture gives way to messianic time,
and historical chapters seemingly sealed away in the past return with
full force into the immediacy of the present: "what characterises
revolutionary classes at their moment of action is the awareness that
they are about to make the continuum of history explode."34 The
explosion is what Benjamin calls a "dialectical leap," a term used in
his analyses of the French Revolution and its selfperception as Rome
incarnate. According to Benjamin, this is a "tiger's leap into the past.
Such a leap, however, takes place in an arena where the ruling class
gives the commands. The same leap in the open air of history is the
dialectical leap Marx understood as revolution".35 Benjamin's
convergence with Fanon can be established on the basis of the shared
temporal specificity of their treatment of rupture. Benjamin understands
without rupture, nothing is able to change. Despite appearing to move
forward, the 'progressive' train in Benjamin's metaophor is actually at
a stand-still. [Bad faith uses the myth of progress to look backwards
down the narrow, linear path of the tracks that produced oppression and
exploitation in the first instance]{.underline}. By contrast, [the
explosive nature of rupture immediately collapses the myth of
progress.]{.underline} Messianic time demands recognition in good faith,
in order for the recognition of history and historical injustice to be
truly redemptive. In a similar vein to Fanon, Benjamin also looks to
[violence as a political phenomenon that emphasises the explosive nature
of rupture]{.underline}. This is specifically manifest in the idea of
divine [violence, which enacts justice in its intervening role in
institutionalized or structural violence]{.underline}.36 It
[exists]{.underline} [outside]{.underline} [of]{.underline} any [legally
endorsed violence, and in its spontaneous bursts, it makes visible the
injustice of existing legal frameworks.]{.underline} Although divine
violence for Benjamin cannot be a means to an end, [it]{.underline}
still [has historical significance in signifying a collective will to
political change]{.underline}. To this end, divine violence exists in
parallel to Fanon's conceptions of revolutionary agency, which manifests
spontaneously outside of a well-articulated political project of
resistance. It is for this reason that Fanon looks to the rural
peasantry as the revolutionary class. Because of their physical
isolation from the cities, Fanon points out that the constitution of the
native peasantry "obeys its own logic, and neither the brimming activity
of the missionaries nor the decrees of the central government can check
its growth".37 In Benjamin, divine violence reveals a momentary flash in
the underlying sentiments of an oppressed population, pure in its
opposition to all laws.38 Both Fanon and Benjamin converge in terms of
the momentary, explosive nature of rupture, particularly in terms of its
reliance on spontaneity.

### AT: Agonism

#### Agonism is wrong -- it falsely assumes the state as the starting point for radical action, which reinscribes the subjugation of indigenous points of view

**Verdeja 17** (Verdeja, Ernesto. "Political Reconciliation in
Postcolonial Settler Societies." International Political Science Review,

Political Violence (Temple University Press, 2009).) //bc

First, [by privileging radical critique, it is difficult to identify,
much less justify, reconciliation's constitutive elements in agonistic
terms.]{.underline} In agonism, **[reconciliation is treated as the
outcome of power relations but otherwise has no substantive normative
content]{.underline}**. Mouffe herself admits this; for her, basic norms
such as equality and liberty cannot be justified through appeals to
human reason or natural law, but are wholly the product of particular
political struggles, with their own historical specificities and
contingencies (Mouffe, 2005: 2--12). And yet she also claims, correctly,
that **[those who reject these basic democratic norms threaten the
possibility of shared political life]{.underline}**. As [there can be no
compelling rational grounds]{.underline} (on her terms) [for adopting
these norms]{.underline}, [she is left with making an affective claim
for their relevance]{.underline}, **[arguing for a "passionate
commitment to a system of reference \[i.e. shared democratic
norms\]"]{.underline}** (Mouffe, 2000: 95). Taking up this challenge,
Muldoon has further radicalized Mouffe's theory by advocating a
Nietzschean agonist reconciliation that respects the democratic values
of peaceful contestation but defends the use of agonistic struggle by
indigenous groups against the state. He writes, "...[indigenous people
need to appreciate the rules of the ga]{.underline}me \[i.e. rules of
democratic contestation\] [and... need to engage agonistically in it in
order to expand and protect indigenous-specific rights"]{.underline}
(Muldoon, 2010: 134). **[However, it is not apparent why the "rules of
the game" should be respected in the first place;]{.underline}** **[a
theoretical perspective that treats normative claims as expressions of
power will struggle with justifying various desirable normative
concepts, such as reconciliation]{.underline}** (or equality, liberty,
and indigenous rights in the examples above). This leads to a second,
more serious concern: **[the reduction of reconciliation to power
relations undermines the possibility of establishing a critical position
from which to examine responses to the past]{.underline}**. For
instance[, how does one distinguish between normatively defensible
versions of reconciliation that advance the claims of indigenous groups
versus those that privilege state power and majority
culture?]{.underline} Certainly, some transformative relations are more
desirable than others, especially from the perspective of indigenous
actors. Agonist theorists recognize the need for normative
criteria---they are, almost unanimously, motivated by concerns over
oppressed groups (see contributions in Hirsch, 2012a). However, [the
agonist perspective]{.underline}, which reduces norms and values to
expressions of power, **[risks undermining the possibility of defending
any normative criteria for political reconciliation]{.underline}**. As
Adrian Little has argued, **["the problem with agonistic accounts is the
difficulty of establishing a founding order of
reconciliation]{.underline}** [which can act as an agreed basis on which
to conduct a more inclusive but conflictual form of political
engagement]{.underline}" (Little, 2012: 67). Of course, any account of
reconciliation must be subjected to revision, reflection and evaluation,
and not formulated as transcending politics or remaining outside the
bounds of contestation. But [some criteria are required if
reconciliation]{.underline}, no matter how agonistic and thin, **[is to
avoid undermining its very possibility and collapsing into normative
indeterminacy]{.underline}**. In the following sections, I outline an
account of reconciliation that takes seriously the charges leveled by
agonistic theorists but also provides some minimally defensible elements
that go beyond agonism.

### AT: Binarism/Structure

#### Their criticism of Settler Colonialism scholarship is selective and wrong -- no link to their binarism or structuralism arguments they misread our authors 

**Young, Honors Faculty Fellow, 17**

(Alex Trimble, is a scholar of transnational settler colonialism and
United States literature and culture. His current research focuses on
how the oppositional literature in the contemporary U.S. has been shaped
by the ongoing history of settler colonialism and Indigenous resistance;
October 2017, "A Response to 'On Colonial Unknowing'", *Theory & Event*,
Volume 20, Number 4, pp. 1035-1041, jwm)

The [success of settler colonial studies as an analytic has not been
accompanied by a comparable institutionalization]{.underline}. There are
[no settler colonial studies programs, research centers, or endowed
professorships]{.underline}. We point this out not to state a grievance
(genuine interdisciplinarity is one of settler colonial studies'
greatest strengths), but to highlight the fact that to be an academic
engaged in settler colonial studies is necessarily to be engaged in
broader field and disciplinary conversations. The number of scholars
involved in settler colonial studies who would identify it as their
primary or even secondary field is, we believe (claims about this type
of identification are difficult to verify), exceptionally small. Settler
Colonial Studies remains the only institution (such that it is) directly
associated with its eponymous field.7 [For this reason, Vimalassery et.
al.'s claims regarding the supposedly dogmatic and hermetic tendencies
of the field ought to be judged in relation to the work published in our
journal]{.underline}. Even a brief survey of the work published in
Settler Colonial Studies reveals that [the field has enabled discussion
and collaboration between Indigenous and non-native scholars of
remarkable and global diversity engaged in rigorous and anti-dogmatic
debate about questions of empire and decolonization]{.underline}. While
the work published in our journal engages settler colonialism as a
meaningful concept, [the exact terms of the settler colonial distinction
continue to be debated]{.underline}. Our editorial collective jokes that
there must be few journals that publish so many articles that
strenuously critique the work of the journal's editors. This is an
intellectual capaciousness we celebrate. That being said, settler
colonial studies did emerge as a distinct field in a context dominated
by white settler scholars, as Tiffany Lethabo King and others have
noted.8 If settler colonial studies today is practiced by a much more
diverse set of scholars and is connected to a much broader range of
intellectual traditions than it was as an emergent field, much work
remains to be done in expanding its citational practices and
intellectual genealogies. White settler scholars who came to prominence
during the field's emergence should not be heralded as "discoverers" of
a new body of knowledge, but rather as having provided a supplement to
much older traditions of critique emerging from Indigenous and
racialized communities.9 In assess[ing the evolving citational practices
of the field, however, it is important to recognize that alongside the
risk of non-native scholars occluding the work of Indigenous and other
marginalized scholars by acts of omission, there is an attendant risk of
occluding that work through acts of appropriation]{.underline}. It was
this latter risk with which Patrick [Wolfe]{.underline}, who remains one
of the field's most cited theorists, [was most deeply
concerned]{.underline}. Wolfe wrote Settler Colonialism and the
Transformation of Anthropology at a moment in which white settler
scholars in British Commonwealth nations were enthusiastically
identifying their own traditions as post-colonial.10 [Wolfe's early
interventions were aimed not at detracting from the work of the South
Asian theorists]{.underline} who spearheaded the postcolonial critique,
or sequestering the study of settler colonialism off from broader
discussions of empire. By interrogating representations of Indigenous
alterity within the Australian academy, [Wolfe's monograph sought to
turn the focus of white settler scholars away from acts of ethnographic
"ventriloquism" and toward their own imbrication in an ongoing structure
of imperial violence that settler nations' identification with the
"post" in postcolonial obfuscated]{.underline}. Indigenous resistance
and sovereignty are carefully decentered in Settler Colonialism and the
Transformation of Anthropology not because Wolfe sought to devalue
Indigenous intellectual traditions, but because he was hyperaware of his
own positionality and the risk of perpetuating the appropriative
tradition he was critiquing. The specificity of Wolfe's citational
practice to his own standpoint and intellectual moment is one of the
many reasons that, in mourning his passing, settler colonial studies
scholars should be careful to eschew the hagiographies that hold him up
as a patron saint of the field even as we celebrate his remarkable
contribution to scholarship.11 The editors of "On Colonial Unknowing"
read Wolfe's influence on the field as one that has already become
overbearing. After lauding Wolfe's work as "generative," they go on to
suggest that its continuing influence on the field has been anything
but, arguing that it has been taken up "reductively to occlude settler
colonialism as constitutively entangled with broader imperial
formations."12 They cite no examples of this misapprehension taking
place. Without example, the ways in which "generative" becomes
"reductive" remain unclear. [There is no doubt that Wolfe's most
memorable formulations, like those of any generative theorist, have been
reduced at times to the level of truism or platitude. These reductive
usages, however, are hardly representative of how the field has engaged
with Wolfe's work]{.underline}. **[Vimalassery et. al.]{.underline}**
[take issue]{.underline}, for instance, **[with Wolfe's insistence on a
neat delineation between Native and non-Native as the structuring binary
of setter colonialism]{.underline}**. They join a years-old chorus of
scholars working within settler colonial studies in doing so. Lorenzo
**[Veracini's more complex structural analysis of settler colonial
population economy as a dynamic system operating in relation to both
indigenous and exogenous alterities, and indeed Jodi Byrd's application
of Braithwaite's conception of "the arrivant" are already frequently
engaged]{.underline}**.13 The editors of "On Colonial Unknowing"
[marshal such objections into a broader critique of the idea that
settler colonialism is a "structure not an event," suggesting that
analyses that employ Wolfe's formulation effect two undesirable
outcomes: firstly, preventing the ability to undertake historically
grounded analysis that recognizes the relationality of settler
colonialism to other forms of imperial violence, and secondly (and more
insidiously), attributing "finality to events of conquest and
dispossession."]{.underline}14 Regarding **[the first
claim,]{.underline}** one need hardly look further than **[Wolfe's last
book -- Traces of History: Elementary Structures of Race -- to find a
refutation.]{.underline}** Whatever its faults, **[one cannot argue that
Traces of History fails to attend to historical differences in modes of
racialization]{.underline}**. [Wolfe's study of the structures of race
is not antithetical to the idea that those structures emerged out of
history]{.underline}, or the idea that "being contingent, they can be
overcome."15 As Veracini put it in 2014 in a defense of settler colonial
studies, "[Settler colonial studies deals in structures, not in
structuralisms. The structure is in what it is observing, not in its
methodological approach. Looking at a structure does not make one a
structuralist]{.underline} any more than studying history makes one a
historicist."16 Insofar as settler colonial studies is being practiced
[as a mode of structuralism that reifies or attributes finality to the
structures of violence it critiques, we join the editors of "On Colonial
Unknowing" in rejecting it.]{.underline} But again, [they offer no
examples of this tendency in action, and we find nothing to suggest that
such a tendency has come to define the field]{.underline}. To recognize
settler colonial studies as the study of a structure rather than a mode
of structuralism is to recognize the field as playing a necessarily
circumscribed role in decolonial study. We endorse the invaluable
reminder offered recently by Kˉehaulani Kauanui: "[Settler Colonial
Studies does not, should not, and cannot replace Indigenous Studies."17
We would add Black studies, ethnic studies, and gender studies (an
incomplete list) to this injunction.]{.underline} At the same time,
settler colonial studies would be meaningless without its continued
engagement with such fields, and its robust support for these fields as
they fight for their own precarious positions within the academy. **[The
tools the field of settler colonial studies has developed for the
critique of a specific structure of violence can aid in theorizing how
that structure might be dismantled]{.underline}**, but they cannot
constitute the radical horizon of decolonial thought, nor were they
intended to. Indigenous studies should not be limited to the study of
one of the structures that has sought, and failed, to destroy Indigenous
resistance. [Decolonial solidarities are not defined by the modes of
identity that settler colonialism or other structures of imperial
violence impose and police]{.underline}. The [vital work by Indigenous
and non-native scholars across the globe that has been empowered by its
engagement with settler colonialism as a conceptual category is a
testament, however, to the ongoing need for the subfield of settler
colonial studies as a specific yet transnational and interdisciplinary
venue for developing such interventions]{.underline}.18 Contemporary
settler colonies share a tendency to graft narratives of
anti-metropolitan revolt and universal liberation onto a root of
imperial violence. These narratives all too often allow settler colonies
to enter broader conversations about empire as nations that have
successfully rejected empire (entering the postcolonial), or in the case
of the United States, only become imperial with the launch of its own
large-scale projects in blue-water imperialism. [By analyzing invasion
as "a structure not an event," settler colonial studies has enabled a
productive mode of critique that examines how eliminatory violence can
subtend even the most unlikely discourses of liberation in settler
colonial circumstances]{.underline}. **[This]{.underline}** mode of
**[analysis]{.underline}** **[will remain]{.underline}** one
**[important]{.underline}** tool **[among many as we continue to work
toward]{.underline}** an **[understanding the interrelation between
multiple forms of empire, and build relational solidarities that work
toward a decolonial future]{.underline}** in which "justice is realized
for all \[...\] peoples, and equality is not only espoused, but
practiced."19

### AT: Crackdown

#### State crackdown is a security trap that classifies indigenous groups as extremist, denies self-determination, and bolsters settler sovereignty by suppressing movements

[In addition to military intelligence, Canada\'s national police force
also played a pivotal role in the surveillance network targeting the
movement.]{.underline} Far from being simply a matter of \"objective\"
public order policing, [the surveillance measures]{.underline} initiated
from the RCMP betray a political hostility to the movement and [show
that Idle No More was **interpreted as a threat to settler society that
must be contained and suppressed**.]{.underline} For example, one email
from RCMP Corporal Wayne Russett, the Aboriginal liaison for the
national capital region, to Inspector Mike LeSage, [the acting director
general for National Aboriginal Policing, described Idle No More
as]{.underline} follows: This Idle No More Movement is like
[bacteria]{.underline}, it has grown a life of its own all across this
nation. It may be advisable for all to have contingency plans in place,
as this is one issue that is not going to go away\... .There is a high
probability that we could see flash mobs, round dances and blockades
become much less compliant to laws in an attempt to get their point
across. [The escalation of violence is ever near.]{.underline} (Barrera
2015) [Conjuring discursive representations of **biopolitical
management**, the likening of Idle No More to bacteria that threaten the
health of the nation is **twinned with a racialized characterization of
indigenous movements as violent**.]{.underline} This characterization
[**delegitimizes indigenous claims to** treaty rights and
**self-determination**, casting these movements as illiberal enemies of
progress]{.underline} (Coulthard 2007). Though no reports of violence
(from protestors) have been associated with Idle No More, the RCMP
became fixated on the scope of the movement and its disruption of
highways and railways. One briefing note prepared by RCMP Criminal
Intelligence headquarters from February 2013 noted that there have been
\"more than 700 events \... across Canada consisting of peaceful
demonstrations. However, significant protest days occurred on January
5,11,16, and 28,2013, on which economic blockades (both partial and
full) were organized on ports of entry (such as ferries and
internationalbridges),on significant major highways,on railways, and on
inter-provincial bridges\" (RCMP 2013-5506, l).The briefing note
consists of a detailed compilation of regional protests and highway
disruptions. The documents note that \"\[ajccording to reports, a full
blockade of Hwy 63 near Fort McMurray has been a concern by third
parties as it is the only corridor to many of the sites associated with
the Oil Sands Industry\" (RCMP 2013-5506, 2). Under \"Strategic
Considerations,\" the briefing note calls attention to potential unrest
resulting from a call for another National Day of Action on February
14,2013, to coincide with Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women
Awareness Day. Demonstrating the systematic surveillance of indigenous
protests, the note says that \"approximately eight events of solidarity
are currently planned in the province of Alberta for that day\" (RCMP
2013---5506,4). A final concluding section of the briefing note appears
under the headline of \"Extremism Components and Associated
Criminality\" and underlines how Idle No More presents a serious threat
to traffic and railway transportation. [In what functions as **a
\"security trap\"**(]{.underline}CASE Collective 2006), [indigenous
movements are framed as criminal threats for their disruptions of the
economic status quo but also labeled as \"extremist\"in the new lexicon
of counterterrorism. National security is invoked to
justify]{.underline} procedural and political license for policing
agencies to engage in [widespread surveillance, particularly against
movements that threaten the normalcy of settler colonialism]{.underline}
and the imagination of Canada as a post-colonial entity. As Pasternak et
al. (2013, 66) have shown, the criminalization of indigenous movements
in Canada rests on framing assertions of self-determination \"as
existing outside\' the bounds of reasonable recognition of Aboriginal
rights.\" As [an extension of the colonial practices that have long
monitored indigenous communities for threats against settler
colonialism]{.underline} (Smith 2009), security agencies have
intensified their surveillance and policing of indigenous movements as
part of the war on terror. In the following section [we link the
surveillance of Idle No More to **a broader program of settler
governmentality that under the banner of national security classifies
indigenous groups that threaten colonial development as
\"extremist."**]{.underline}

### AT: Framework

#### Centering indigenous experiences in policymaking is imperative to understanding the contemporary grief they face daily and helps heal this grief

[Utilising an Indigenous research paradigm, we centred the use of
story]{.underline} (novels, poetry and podcast) [by Indigenous authors
about Indigenous people's lives. This]{.underline} form of knowledge
sharing [carries on the storytelling tradition, allowing modern readers
insight into the lives of Indigenous people]{.underline} living in urban
or non-reserve settings. The social workers and social service systems
focus on the most acute presenting issue, but that is only a part of the
grief experienced in these stories. [Stories offer insight into how
Indigenous people navigated through grief to find healing.]{.underline}
Most important to the characters was reconnection with family and
culture, or reconciling the loss of these relationships that were the
result of settler colonialism. Stories have the advantage of giving the
reader a long view of these events because the authors are depicting
traumatic events in the context of a character's life. [The]{.underline}
practice implications and **[broader lessons learned from these stories
are applicable to Indigenous populations globally.]{.underline}** The
cultural responsiveness to these stories through social work practice by
integrating art and healing into a more holistic way of being, addresses
key aspects of the World Health Organization Sustainable Development
Goals of peace and justice, reduced inequalities and improved health and
well-being for Indigenous people, especially for those who have a shared
colonial experience. Through reading the stories and examining the
themes related to ambiguous loss, we have contributed to further
understanding the application of this framework on shared experiences of
foster care, sexual violence, residential schools and Indigenous
peoples. Children in foster care balance their impermanence and a sense
of belonging in a family system (Samuels, 2009), an experience shared by
survivors of residential schools. The storytellers underscore emotional
impacts of loss of connection to culture and the yearning their
characters have to reunite with family. Samuels (2009) expanded
ambiguous loss theory to recognise that the systems and structures
created ambiguous losses for these children. Certainly, **[Indigenous
experiences of settler colonialism advance the ways in which the
characters navigated national policy and practices that removed them
from their families, cultures and homes.]{.underline}** Additionally,
[people suffering from ambiguous losses often struggle to find
meaning]{.underline} (Boss, 2010). [For healing to occur, a pathway to
hope and healing must be established.]{.underline} One avenue is through
spirituality, ceremony or religious practices and connection to others
(Boss, 2010). [The storytellers provide that hope and healing as we
witness the healing process for each character.]{.underline} These
stories underline the fact that connections to family, culture and
ceremony are important components of healing. [An Indigenous
approach]{.underline} to social work [includes spirituality as a central
pillar and is grounded in place]{.underline} (Hart, 2009). It is
necessary for social workers to know the history of place from an
Indigenous perspective and promote Indigenous rights (Hart 2009). Social
workers can actively incorporate these approaches through cultural
humility as they commit to continuous lifelong learning about Indigenous
cultures and then actively challenging the inequalities for individuals
and in institutions (Fisher-Borne et al., 2015). [These storytellers
provide insights that are important to understanding Indigenous
experiences.]{.underline} Social work practitioners can identify
appropriate interventions to address feelings and beliefs of Indigenous
clients (Betz and Thorngren, 2006). Stories can be used as culturally
relevant treatment when working with Indigenous people.

### AT: Not a structure

#### Holding settlerism to merely an event ignores settler futurity and the logic of elimination that translates into the status quo 

**Tuck and Fernandez 13** Eve is an award winning scholar in field of
Indigenous studies and educational research Rubén A.
Gaztambide-Fernández is an Associate Professor in the Department of
Curriculum, Teaching and Learning at the Ontario Institute for Studies
in Education of the University of Toronto \["Cirriculum, Replacement,
and Settler Futurity"\]//Mberhe

The settler colonial curricular project of replacement is invested in
[settler futurity]{.underline}, or what Andrew Baldwin calls [the
"**permanent** virtuality" of the settler on stolen land]{.underline}
(2012, p. 173). When [we locate the present of settler colonialism as
only the production of the past, we overlook how settler colonialism is
configured in relation to]{.underline} a different temporal horizon:
**[the future.]{.underline}** To say that something is invested in
something else's futurity is not the same as saying it is invested in
something's future, though the replacement project is invested in both
settler future and futurity. Futurity refers to the ways in which, "the
future is rendered knowable through specific practices (i.e.
calculation, imagination, and performance) and, in turn, intervenes upon
the present through three anticipatory logics (i.e. pre-caution,
pre-emption and preparedness)" (p. 173). Considering the significance of
futurity for researching whiteness and geography, Baldwin (2012) wonders
whether a past-oriented approach reproduces the (false), Teleological
[assumption that white racism can be modernized away]{.underline}. Such
an assumption **[privileges an ontology of linear causality in which the
past is thought to act on the present and the present is said to be an
effect of whatever came before]{.underline}** \[\...\] According to this
kind of temporality, the future is the terrain upon or through which
white racism will get resolved. It cleaves the future from the present
and, thus, gives the future discrete ontological form. (p. 174) Thus, in
this historical analysis of the settler colonial curricular project of
replacement, we seek to emphasize the ways in which replacement is
entirely concerned with settler futurity, which always indivisibly means
the continued and complete eradication of the original inhabitants of
contested land. [Anything that seeks to recuperate and not interrupt
settler colonialism, to reform the settlement and incorporate Indigenous
peoples into the multicultural settler colonial nation state is fettered
to settler futurity.]{.underline} To be clear, our commitments are to
what might be called an Indigenous futurity, which does not foreclose
the inhabitation of Indigenous land by nonIndigenous peoples, but does
foreclose settler colonialism and settler epistemologies. That is to say
that Indigenous futurity does not require the erasure of now-settlers in
the ways that settler futurity requires of Indigenous peoples.

#### Settler Colonialism is not a single event, but an oppressive structure

Patrick **Wolfe**, 12-21-20**06**, \"Settler colonialism and the
elimination of the native,\" Taylor &amp; Francis,
https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14623520601056240
Accessed 6/26/19//SR

As practised by Europeans, both [genocide and settler
colonialism]{.underline} have typically employed the organizing grammar
of race. European xenophobic traditions such as anti-Semitism,
Islamophobia, or Negrophobia [are considerably older than race, which,
as many have shown, became discursively consolidated]{.underline} fairly
late in the eighteenth century.2 But the mere fact that race is a social
construct does not of itself tell us very much. As I have argued,
different [racial regimes encode and reproduce the unequal relationships
into which Europeans coerced the populations concerned.]{.underline} For
instance, [Indians and Black people in the US have been racialized in
opposing ways that reflect their antithetical roles in the formation of
US society.]{.underline} Black people's enslavement produced an
inclusive taxonomy that automatically enslaved the offspring of a slave
and any other parent. In the wake of slavery, this taxonomy became fully
racialized in the "one-drop rule," whereby any amount of African
ancestry, no matter how remote, and regardless of phenotypical
appearance, makes a person Black. For Indians, in stark contrast,
non-Indian ancestry compromised their indigeneity, producing
"half-breeds," a regime that persists in the form of blood quantum
regulations. As opposed to enslaved people, whose reproduction augmented
their owners' wealth, Indigenous people obstructed settlers' access to
land, so their increase was counterproductive. In this way, [the
restrictive racial classification of Indians straightforwardly furthered
the logic of elimination. Thus we cannot simply say that settler
colonialism or genocide have been targeted at particular races, since a
race cannot be taken as given. It is made in the
targeting]{.underline}.3 Black people were racialized as slaves; slavery
constituted their blackness. Correspondingly, Indigenous North Americans
were not killed, driven away, romanticized, assimilated, fenced in, bred
White, and otherwise eliminated as the original owners of the land but
as Indians. Roger Smith has missed this point in seeking to distinguish
between victims murdered for where they are and victims murdered for who
they are.4 [So far as Indigenous people are concerned, where they are is
who they are, and not only by their own reckoning. As Deborah Bird Rose
has pointed out, to get in the way of settler colonization, all the
native has to do is stay at home.5 Whatever settlers may say--- and they
generally have a lot to say---the primary motive for
elimination]{.underline} is not race (or religion, ethnicity, grade of
civilization, etc.) but access to territory[. Territoriality is settler
colonialism's specific, irreducible element]{.underline}. The logic of
elimination not only refers to the summary liquidation of Indigenous
people, though it includes that. In common with genocide as Raphae¨l
Lemkin characterized it,6 settler colonialism has both negative and
positive dimensions. Negatively, it strives for the dissolution of
native societies. Positively, it erects a new colonial society on the
expropriated land base---as I put it, settler colonizers come to stay:
invasion is a structure not an event.7 In its positive aspect,
elimination is an organizing principal of settler-colonial society
rather than a one-off (and superseded) occurrence. The positive outcomes
of the logic of elimination can include officially encouraged
miscegenation, the breaking-down of native title into alienable
individual freeholds, native citizenship, child abduction, religious
conversion, resocialization in total institutions such as missions or
boarding schools, and a whole range of cognate biocultural
assimilations. All these strategies, including frontier homicide, are
characteristic of settler colonialism. Some of them are more
controversial in genocide studies than others. [Settler colonialism
destroys to replace.]{.underline} As Theodor Herzl, founding father of
Zionism, observed in his allegorical manifesto/novel, "If I wish to
substitute a new building for an old one, I must demolish before I
construct."8 In a kind of realization that took place half a century
later, one-time deputy-mayor of West Jerusalem Meron Benvenisti
recalled, "As a member of a pioneering youth movement, I myself 'made
the desert bloom' by uprooting the ancient olive trees of al-Bassa to
clear the ground for a banana grove, as required by the 'planned
farming' principles of my kibbutz, Rosh Haniqra."9 Renaming is central
to the cadastral effacement/replacement of the Palestinian Arab presence
that Benvenisti poignantly recounts.10 Comparably, though with reference
to Australia, PATRICK WOLFE 388 Tony Birch has charted the contradictory
process whereby White residents sought to frustrate the (re-) renaming
of Gariwerd back from the derivative "Grampians" that these hills had
become in the wake of their original owners' forcible dispossession in
the nineteenth century.11 Ideologically, however, there is a major
difference between the Australian and Israeli cases. The prospect of
Israeli authorities changing the Hebrew place-names whose invention
Benvenisti has described back to their Arabic counterparts is almost
unimaginable. In Australia, by contrast (as in many other settler
societies), the erasure of indigeneity conflicts with the assertion of
settler nationalism. On the one hand, settler society required the
practical elimination of the natives in order to establish itself on
their territory. [On the symbolic level, however, settler society
subsequently sought to recuperate indigeneity in order to express its
difference---and, accordingly, its independence--- from the mother
country]{.underline}. Hence it is not surprising that a progressive
Australian state government should wish to attach an indigenous aura to
a geographical feature that bore the second-hand name of a British
mountain range. Australian public buildings and official symbolism,
along with the national airlines, film industry, sports teams and the
like, are distinguished by the ostentatious borrowing of Aboriginal
motifs. For nationalist purposes, it is hard to see an alternative to
this contradictory reappropriation of a foundationally disavowed
Aboriginality. The ideological justification for the dispossession of
Aborigines was that "we" could use the land better than they could, not
that we had been on the land primordially and were merely returning
home. One cannot imagine the Al-Quds/Jerusalem suburb of Kfar Sha'ul
being renamed Deir Yasin. Despite this major ideological difference,
however, Zionism still betrays a need to distance itself from its
European origins that recalls the settler anxieties that characterize
Australian national discourse. Yiddish, for instance, was decisively
rejected in favour of Hebrew---a Hebrew inflected, what is more, with
the accents of the otherwise derided Yemeni mizrachim. Analogously, as
Mark LeVine has noted, though the Zionist modernization of the Arab city
of Jaffa was intended to have a certain site specificity, "in fact Jaffa
has had to be emptied of its Arab past and Arab inhabitants in order for
architects to be able to reenvision the region as a 'typical Middle
Eastern city'."1

Settler Colonial Studies and its Discontents [A number of scholars have
critiqued settler colonial studies for its methodology]{.underline}. In
a 2014 article that warranted a special section in Australian Historical
Studies, [social scientist and historian Tim Rowse authoritatively
decried the "structuralist" approach of settler colonial
studies]{.underline}.13 This is an important argument and it was raised
several times afterwards**[. Even if settler colonial studies actually
consists of a variety of very different approaches, it is true that
settler colonial studies focused on the ways in which settler invasion
structures a particular set of unequal relationships between indigenous
and exogenous collectives]{.underline}**. But ultimately, as I have
argued in [my response to **Rowse's** article, to label scholars
contributing to settler colonial studies "structuralist" is
unwarranted]{.underline}.14 Just as l[ooking at history does not make
you a historicist, observing a particular social structure does not make
you a structuralist.]{.underline} Similarly, law historian Lisa Ford,
who collaborated with Rowse in an important international project
appraising the heterogeneity of contemporary indigenous-settler
relations in multiple contexts, [criticized settler colonial studies for
its tendency to propose abstract analyses detached from specific
situations: an alleged failure to contextualize]{.underline}.15 Again,
this is a most relevant observation. But [**all theory is a result of
abstraction.**]{.underline} Hence, Ford [critiques settler colonial
studies for doing precisely what it set out to do: to abstract for the
purpose of theory.]{.underline} [Criticism]{.underline} [like this can
only be sustained if]{.underline} [we]{.underline} somehow [imagine that
the scholarly debate that underpins the emergence of settler colonial
studies is entirely disconnected from surrounding]{.underline}
disciplinary [fields]{.underline} [and scholarly
traditions]{.underline}. Moreover, conceptual-analytic and
empirical-descriptive moments are necessarily linked: [one would not
exist without the other]{.underline}. The critique here is that settler
colonial studies forsakes empirical observation, while actually it is
predicated on it. Settler colonial studies would not be possible without
work that emanates from related disciplinary traditions and national
historiographies. Possibly the most significant characteristic of
settler colonial studies as a developing subfield has been its
transdisciplinary and comparative character. Indeed, [in this instance
abstraction should be seen as the dialectical outcome of empiric
achievement, not its denial.]{.underline} Other scholars have contested
settler colonial studies by focusing on its findings. Uncomfortable with
the notion of a "logic of elimination" and its proliferation in a
multiplicity of interpretative contexts, New Zealand historian of
imperial formations Tony [Ballantyne authoritatively criticized a
definition of elimination]{.underline} "so capacious as to be
analytically unhelpful."16 [But the definitional apparatus of settler
colonial studies and its emphasis on elimination is dialectically linked
to its opposite: let's call it the colonial logic of reinscription, the
ongoing reproduction of colonial difference]{.underline}, the 4 à à à
American Indian Culture and Research Journal 41:1 (2017) sustained
implementation of what Partha Chatterjee has called colonialism's "rule
of difference."17 A [drive towards elimination and a focus on the
reproduction of colonial difference remain dialectically
linked]{.underline}. In any case, settler colonial studies always aimed
to complement, not replace, colonial or imperial studies. [The notion
that settler colonial studies allegedly proclaims the elimination of
indigenous resistance is much repeated]{.underline}, yet an [exploration
of settler colonialism's "logic" of elimination cannot be construed as
an appraisal of an accomplished elimination]{.underline}. How this
"zombie" claim has proliferated is epitomized by Miranda Johnson's
recent dismissal of Wolfe's work as "insufficient": relying on the
critiques of others, her argument misreads **[Wolfe]{.underline}**, who
**[never suggested that settler colonialism successfully "eliminates"
indigenous peoples]{.underline}**.18 [The]{.underline} fundamental
[distinction]{.underline} here is [between the "logic of elimination"
and "elimination."]{.underline} They are identified by different terms
and are not the same, yet this distinction is lost in these critiques.
Generally, they take two shapes: some emphasize that indigenous peoples
retained agency and the ability of shaping relationships in the past and
for a long time, and that this ability counters the notion that
indigenous autonomy was "eliminated" by settler invasion. As a result, a
focus on the "middle ground" and its longevity diverts attention from
the successive settler onslaught on indigenous communities. Others note
that indigenous struggles for sovereignty and self-affirmation will
renegotiate the terms of settler domination in the future, and that
present struggles, through their very existence, counter the notion that
indigenous autonomy was ever "eliminated." Both [approaches fail to
consider that the logic of elimination and indigenous agency and
resurgence are also dialectically related]{.underline}. Whether in the
past or in the present, [settler colonialism's logic of elimination
remains the dialectical counterpart of indigenous
sovereignty]{.underline}. Neither should be appraised in isolation.
Rowse, Ford, Johnson, and Ballantyne---a group that includes a settler
scholar whose expertise is primarily in indigenous policy, two law
historians, and an historian of British imperial formations---have
expressed an antipodean reluctance to acknowledge settler colonial
studies.19 This is, however, a global debate. Scholars contributing to
borderlands historiographies have similarly expressed dissatisfaction
with settler colonial studies. They are especially [alarmed by some of
its keywords, such as "takeover," "elimination," "structure," and
"binaries."]{.underline} This should not surprise, given that
borderlands historiographies are characterized by very different terms:
"situational," "circumstantial," "ambiguous," "contingent," and
"unpredictable."20 Borderlands historiographies concentrate on an "end
of empire" in locales where the power of imperial centers finally wanes,
exhausted by distance. These two literatures have developed different
terminologies because they examine different circumstances. But settler
colonial studies, too, refers to an "the end of empire" of sorts: an
empire that runs its course without exhausting itself---an empire that
completes its "transit," to use Jodi Byrd's apt concept.21 Supersession
is neither a colonial reinscription of difference nor a borderlands
dissolution of power. I would like to suggest that an articulation of
analytical labor may be emerging here: one historiography addresses
locales where "anything can happen," and where power is "contested by
many and controlled by none"; the other deals with settings Veracini \|
Decolonizing Settler Colonialism 5 where "something has happened," that
is, settler conquest, which prompts the [recurrence of unfounded
allegations that settler colonial studies sees settler colonialism as
ultimately "inevitable."]{.underline}22 And yet, even an analysis that
is guided by a determination to recover the historical ascendancies of
indigenous polities and their ability to exercise their "imperial
moments" against indigenous and nonindigenous collectives alike has to
consider the successive emergence and consolidation of settler-colonial
orders.23 The two approaches may complement each other rather than being
mutually exclusive. Different focuses may result in a non-debate, like a
tennis match between accomplished players who face off at opposite ends
of separate courts. But I would suggest that this tension should not be
seen as necessarily sterile; borderlands historiographies and settler
colonial studies remain dialectically linked. Moreover, [settler
colonial studies was never meant to operate in an intellectual
vacuum.]{.underline} Rather, as a paradigm identifying a specific mode
of domination, it was designed to explore the dialectical tension
between exploitation and elimination. Of course, this tension is not
new---it constitutes, for example, Hegel's master-slave dialectic (one
may disagree that it represents what actually happened, but it cannot be
denied that it remains a seminal contribution to the ways we understand
exploitation).24 Elimination and exploitation not only coexist in
tension; they also codefine each other.25 One does not exist without the
other, and in their dialectical opposition one brings the other into
existence. Emphasizing a constitutive dialectic, settler colonial
studies was always meant to integrate, not displace, the already
available ways in which colonial phenomena are analyzed. Nor was it an
attempt to flatten complexity or predetermining outcomes; on the
contrary, as part of a dialectical reflection, [settler colonial studies
was meant to enable a focus on the constitutive binaries that produce
hybridity, and not only as a result of an encounter between different
subjectivities following displacement and the colonial encounter, but
also as a result of interaction between different modalities of
domination that appear in the spectrum of possibilities characterized by
exploitation and extermination]{.underline}. Rather than contest
borderlands methodologies, settler colonial studies was an invitation to
explore the borderlands where different modalities of oppression, not
simply different empires and their agencies, meet. An articulation of
analytical labor may apply with regard to other disciplinary approaches
as well. Introducing an edited collection on the topic of "Native
Diasporas," Gregory Smithers and Brooke Newman recently argued against
"rigid paradigms" and for "fresh, meaningful, and methodologically
innovative ways."26 According to these authors, who note that Wolfe sees
indigenous history as made up of only victimization and violence,
Wolfe's paradigm is restrictive and limits Native agency---hence their
commitment to a postcolonial perspective. Postcolonial studies'
reiteration of an irreducible hybridity, however, results from a
disinclination to inquire into its constitutive components.27 This
inquiry would complement, not betray, specific observation, and analyze,
not reduce, "heterogeneity."28 What is, after all, hybridity constituted
by? It is like saying, for example, that gravity "just is," instead of
thinking about force and mass. Other scholars have complained about
settler colonial studies' consolidation relative to other fields. In a
brief article published in the magazine of the American Historical
Association, Nancy Shoemaker reminds historians that settler colonialism
6 à à à American Indian Culture and Research Journal 41:1 (2017) is only
one among many (i.e., twelve) types of colonialism and noted that in
"the past several years, settler colonial theory has taken over my
field."29 Similarly, Kēhaulani Kauanui recently noted that "Settler
Colonial Studies does not, should not, and cannot replace Indigenous
Studies," and that "to exclusively focus on the settler colonial without
any meaningful engagement with the indigenous---as has been the case in
how Wolfe's work has been cited---can (re)produce another form of
'elimination of the native.'"30 Echoing similar concerns, Canada-based
scholars Corey **[Snelgrove]{.underline}**, Rita Kaur
**[Dhamoon]{.underline}**, and Jeff **[Corntassel]{.underline}** have
[argued recently that a renewed focus on settlers and their hegemony may
contribute to obscuring indigenous peoples]{.underline}.31 The focus
shift is undeniable. But t[here is a specific genealogy at work here
that should not be ignored. Settler colonial studies is necessarily
predicated on the previous achievements of indigenous
scholars.]{.underline} **[It does not displace indigenous-based
scholarship and its epistemologies; indeed, it acknowledges them through
its very existence as well as through scholarly
referencing]{.underline}**. But reinscribing the settlers as the only
agents of history and, historiographically speaking, returning full
circle to a pre-1960s exclusive focus on heroic, manly pioneers is now
impossible. On the contrary, [emphasis on this presumed risk itself
neglects the relevance of the indigenous-led paradigm
shift]{.underline}. [There is no way back:]{.underline} the
[achievements]{.underline} [of indigenous studies]{.underline} and other
historiographies in [centering the experience and epistemologies of
indigenous peoples are now irreversible and we are all better off for
it]{.underline}. Also, a determination not to ventriloquize, or to speak
on behalf of indigenous voices, should not be misconstrued as neglect,
nor does deference to indigenous voices mean there is a lack of
interest.32 In their survey of what they define as ways of "colonial
unknowing," Manu **[Vimalassery]{.underline}**, Juliana **[Hu
Pegues]{.underline}**, and Alyosha **[Goldstein]{.underline}** similarly
referred to settler colonial studies.33 They were [considering "the ways
in which the generative work of Patrick Wolfe has been taken up
reductively to occlude settler colonialism as constitutively entangled
with broader imperial formations]{.underline}," how analyses of settler
colonialism "as isolated from imperialism and differential modes of
racialization are consequences of the institutionalization of this work
as a distinct subfield," and how this approach can "foreclose or bracket
out interconnections and relational possibilities."34 [They do not
mention specific instances of this actually happening]{.underline}---and
there is a good reason why you need a body to set up a murder trial. My
suggestion, however, is that disciplinary currents actually ran the
other way around: **[it was the analysis of settler colonialism that
followed those of colonialism and imperialism; it was settler colonial
studies that made observing the interconnections
possible]{.underline}**. [Other critiques have noted a tendency to see
settler colonialism as "inevitable and transhistorical."]{.underline}35
The [possibility of preemption is a serious charge; preemption is, after
all, what settlers do as they enter "empty" lands (or what their
sovereigns do, depending on who retains the initiative]{.underline}),36
and [preemption is incontestably a move critical analysis should
avoid]{.underline}, not replicate. It is true that the
[scholars]{.underline} who have [contributed to settler colonial studies
as a developing field have collectively focused on settler colonialism
as a mode of domination]{.underline}, **[but they certainly do not think
that it is "unavoidable."]{.underline}** It is like the television
series Mayday (known in Australia and elsewhere as Aircrash
Investigations), which focuses on the planes that crash, but nonetheless
does not assume that all planes must invariably fall from the sky.
Likewise[, in exploring a specific mode of domination settler colonial
studies observes ongoing subjection, but to do so neither predetermines
it nor sees it where there is none]{.underline}. Ultimately, the best
way to respond to these criticisms is to patiently reconstruct
genealogies. [Settler colonial studies cannot replace indigenous studies
because it is predicated on it]{.underline}. Settler colonial studies
cannot obstruct an analysis of the relationship between differently
colonized constituencies because it follows the consolidation of
colonial and postcolonial studies. If anything, [it enables a relational
analysis that had been previously impossible.]{.underline} The same
holds true for the notion that settler colonialism was only one mode of
domination among many and often not even the most important one: the
analysis of settler colonial phenomena was added to the analysis of
other colonial formations; it was predicated on this work. It is not a
return, but a dialectical departure. Likewise, [settler colonial studies
cannot be accused of proclaiming indigenous elimination, or of seeing it
as inevitable, because it was born in a contestation of the alleged
"postcoloniality" of settler societies.]{.underline} Setter colonial
studies emerged against claims that assumed a postcolonial condition:
"What? Have they left?"

[We can link]{.underline} Benjamin's interest in history and his
[critique of linear historicism to the problems of recognition and
rupture]{.underline} discussed above. Bound up in Benjamin's notion of
messianicity is the idea of redemption, which he describes as a "secret
index" encoded in the past.14 [The political implication is that
revolutions]{.underline}, [as authentic forms of political
transformation]{.underline}, [redeem past struggles and
conflict]{.underline}. Benjamin's concern for the victims of
history---those not lost to the past but waiting like ghosts for
redemption---plays out in a desire for collective emancipation, which
cannot happen on the terms of historicism. This is because **[the
narrative of progress here undermines the capacity for emancipation by
shutting off the past]{.underline}**, effectively sealing it away as
chapters in history. Consider Benjamin's sixth thesis in "On the Concept
of History," in which he states that "articulating the past historically
does not mean recognizing it "the way it really was. It means
appropriating a memory as it flashes up in a moment of danger."15 For
Benjamin, the passive nature of historical contemplation is insufficient
for a radical politics. By [focusing on nonrecognition]{.underline}, and
[turning to rupture instead]{.underline}, [we can see]{.underline} how
Benjamin looks to [radically rework historicism instead of substituting
the direction of its gaze]{.underline}. It is not through
acknowledgement of historical injustice within the framework of linear
progress towards Europe that can ever truly redeem the past. Recognition
must be on the basis of a radically reformulated conception of time,
that is not history per se, but now-time, with the emphasis placed on
messianic power as a radically active force. Benjamin expands on the
theoretical move described above throughout On the Concept of History.
He configures his critique around social democracy: for Benjamin,
[social democracy wants to be recognised by the mechanisms of power, so
conforms to, and assimilates into, the doctrine of
progress]{.underline}. This has three dangerous consequences which lead
to social democracy being understood as a threat. Firstly, the [social
democrats faith in technological development was mistaken as
"constituting a political achievement]{.underline}."16
[Modernisation]{.underline} [is]{.underline} therefore [taken to mean
progress at the expense of its effect on workers, ignoring how
technological development and its commodities could actually be of
benefit to the working class]{.underline}. Secondly, in "[recognizing
only the progress in mastering nature, not the retrogression of
society,"]{.underline} the social [democrats subscribed to the
domination and exploitation of nature]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} by
extension, [labour]{.underline}.17 **[Progress is measured without
consideration of nature and labour, as its narrative is used
teleologically and in blind faith]{.underline}**. Finally, social
[democracy "already displays the technocratic features that later emerge
in fascism.]{.underline}"18 Benjamin here acknowledges that the
culmination of the [subscription to the narrative of progress in a
totalising move to power by way of the exploitation of natural
resources]{.underline} and human labour. To the extent that the social
democrats desire recognition as a means to an end, they subscribe to the
ideological narratives dictated by power---in this case, the myth of
progress. **[There can be no resistance within the desire for
recognition by the frameworks handed down by structures of
power]{.underline}**. **[A total break with the system is
needed.]{.underline}** In Benjamin's words, a "state of emergency" must
be declared.19 Historical consciousness, as an emancipatory objective
for a radical politics, must take on a radically new meaning that
locates it entirely outside of the given framework of progress. An
entirely [new comprehension of time and history must be
found]{.underline}, and here Benjamin---like Fanon---turns to [the
notion of rupture]{.underline}.

**[This work is aimed at decolonization and, as such, remains firmly
within decolonial and Indigenous conceptual frameworks because
"decolonization does not exist without a framework that centers and
privileges Indigenous life, community, and

stance toward the Lacanian theorization of the unconscious and language
because, in the bare reality, [decolonization is not always about the
co- existence of knowledges]{.underline}, nor knowledge synthesis, which
inevitably centers colonial logic. [Whiteness does not "play well with

and drunk on conquest, **[assimilation is submission and decolonization

Indigenous compatibility with Western knowledge but rather a scouring of
Settler paradigms from the bodies, minds, and souls of all peoples and
lands]{.underline}. In this way, Indigeneity itself comprises a specific
onto- epistemology that is, inevitably, ethico- onto-epistemological.12
[In defining a framework for evaluating and forwarding concepts and
ideas, we adopt specific frameworks that are intertribally rele- vant
for Indigenous peoples]{.underline}.13As Native American philosophers
have pointed out time and time again, the question of ontology for
Indigenous peoples is rooted firmly in the question of relationships
guided by respect, reciprocity, and renewal.14 [The ontological question
is, therefore, never captured within an individualistic ontology but
always multiple and relational.]{.underline} The relationship between
two entities is not simply important to their individual existences, but
it pre-cedes them and makes the entities themselves possible.This form
of being, however, is often denied through a political ontology that is
undergirded by the assumptions of a violently racist Hegelianism.
Attempts at true recognition fall prey to the Settler's misrecognition,
which serves to place Indigenous spirituality in Western metaphysics.
This transla-tion is a form of cosmological violence that reduces spirit
to metaphysics.15Cosmological violence does not operate within the
dialectics of losses and gains but rather is a violence against the
cosmos itself as well as all who reside within it. Violence that
operates at this level necessarily escapes cap-ture by rationality and
operates within an anarational economy of violence. It is anarational in
that it exceeds rationality, but such an excess not only exceeds or
moves beyond rationality but is an excess against rationality.16The
prefix "ana- " means "up, against, back, re- " and, as such,
anarationality is above rationality; it is against it, pushes back on
it, returns rationality to itself.17 [The very nature of anarational
violence is its condition of irrational-ity; however, it is not
irrational in that it lacks a rationale but rather in that it is a
rationale that exceeds and disturbs the very nature of
rationality]{.underline}--- an ante- rationality that is inflected by
the ante- ontology of the Native.18 [Such an ante- ontology, in escaping
the paradigm of in/sanity, frustrates and, in doing so, calls into being
the very logic of sanity that marks it as insane in the first
place.]{.underline}

#### The permutation fails---it functions as a politics of reconciliation that forecloses indigenous refusal and pathologizes indigenous folk as irrational. State reconciliation only solidifies Settler hegemony and trades off with radical politics

[Sorry Day]{.underline} at Risdon Cove [did address past colonial
violence directly]{.underline}, [and was]{.underline} also [performed as
a reconciliatory act]{.underline}. But [its aim was not centred on
Aboriginal experience or Aboriginal cultural reclamation]{.underline};
it was [therefore n]{.underline}ot, at its heart, centrally [a
decolonizing experience]{.underline}. As a public event attended by
church groups and school children, it was as much about
consciousness-raising for settlers, as it was about mourning and
commemoration. Its aims were broad enough for it to be a cross-cultural
and symbolic coming together to generate friendship, however temporary.
The [work of 'sorry' may offer emotional releases for both parties,
build trust, and genuinely assist in forging new
relationships]{.underline}; **[but its attendant politics can once again
firmly position the settler at the centre of the narrative of redemption
and moral recuperation,]{.underline}** something which may seal off
discussion of the past **[and work against struggles to gain Aboriginal
rights and sovereignties in the present.]{.underline}** Crucially,
**[Indigenous peoples have the right to refuse the coercive politics of
sorry]{.underline}**, part of the broader program of reconciliation,
with its Christian principles of restorative justice based on linear
ideas of confession, forgiveness and moving on. As I have been arguing
throughout this book, [reconciliation is both utopic and
coercive]{.underline}, and perpetually structured by ambivalence. Both
national and local reconciliation events signal the urgent and genuine
desire of Indigenous and nonIndigenous peoples to symbolically forge new
friendships. And yet, at the same time, [reconciliation efforts draw
Indigenous peoples into an affective script of refounding a settler
nation that cannot by its very construction admit Indigenous
sovereignty]{.underline}. I suggest that [local efforts organized by
local Indigenous people]{.underline}, communities and groups
[are]{.underline} better [able to creatively engage with]{.underline}
the lofty and often diffuse aims of [reconciliation by being attentive
to specifically Indigenous histories and rituals.]{.underline} In its
coercive aspect, [reconciliation places a hefty psychic burden on
Aboriginal peoples to forgive -- but without the benefits of meaningful
reparation]{.underline}. Such an affective script is at work in the
Christian principles of restorative justice, where victims and
perpetrators are encouraged to meet together for the expression of
remorse and forgiveness to encourage healing on both sides. Annalise
Acorn calls this 'compulsory compassion'.27 As Acorn writes, restorative
justice can be hypocritical because [it 'lacks authenticity, fails to
accommodate people's natural needs to give wrongdoers their just
deserts, \[and\] expects compassion in circumstances where this is
unreasonable and oppressive]{.underline}'.28 Likewise, Roxana Waterson
has cast doubt on whether the Christian emphasis on forgiveness and
mercy can allow for the right of the victim to refuse to be reconciled
with the perpetrator.29 For critics of reconciliation processes, then,
**[what is at stake is the right to reject a politics that requires
Indigenous assent and assimilation to a non-Indigenous desire for
forgiveness and restoration of honour.]{.underline}** Scholars Pauline
Wakeham and Glen Coulthard both argue that **[formal state-based
reconciliation can work to recuperate and re-establish settler
hegemony.]{.underline}**30 A[rguing for the productive and political
force of anger and resentment]{.underline} as emotions, and critiquing
the Canadian politics of reconciliation, [Coulthard contests the way in
which Indigenous expressions of anger and resentment are too often
represented 'as "negative"]{.underline} emotions that threaten to impede
the realization of reconciliation in the lives of Indigenous people and
communities on the one hand, and between Indigenous nations and Canada
on the other'.31 Coulthard continues: More often than not [defenders of
reconciliation represent these emotional expressions in an unsympathetic
light -- as irrational, as physically and psychologically unhealthy, as
reactionary, backward looking, and even as socially
pathological]{.underline}. In contradistinction to this view, I argue
that **[in the context of ongoing settler-colonial injustice, Indigenous
peoples' anger and resentment can indicate a sign of moral protest and
political outrage that we ought to at least take seriously, if not
embrace as a sign of our critical consciousness]{.underline}**.32
Coulthard suggests that [anger and the 'politics of resentment' are a
productive force and a form of political practice for Indigenous
peoples.]{.underline} Following Franz Fanon's assertion that the
colonial state apparatus cannot produce emancipatory effects but rather
reduplicate patterns of domination, Coulthard is sceptical of
reconciliation and the politics of recognition around which sorry and
forgiveness are based. He argues, rather, for [a 'host of
self-affirmative cultural practices that colonized peoples often
critically engage in to empower themselves, as opposed to relying too
heavily on the subjectifying apparatus of the state or other dominant
institutions of power to do this for them']{.underline}.33 Within a
[settler-colonial logic, to reconcile is to be a 'good' and compliant
citizen of the settler state; to refuse to reconcile renders Indigenous
peoples as non-compliant and unwilling to be part of the
nation.]{.underline} Tasmanian Aboriginal artist Julie Gough has
declared, 'We are sick of being "conciliated!"' In her performance art
piece Manifestation (Bruny Island), a European chair is set alight with
an Aboriginal spear. Burning on the rocky shore of Bruny Island on the
southeast coast of Tasmania, [the chair aflame references the frontier
past and the guerrilla tactics of Aboriginal peoples' war of resistance
and their use of fire to burn the houses and crops of
colonists]{.underline}. The chair is an emblem of domesticity and
domestication, which, as Ghassan Hage has argued, is a crucial element
in the construction of the settler-colonial fantasy of 'home' and the
creation of homely spaces.34 [The chair is symbolic of a settler
identity establishing itself through domesticating alien difference
under the sign of familiarity]{.underline}. It also makes reference to
the efforts of the Bruny Island mission, instated by George Augustus
Robinson, to conciliate and civilize Aboriginal people -- to domesticate
them -- through familiar Christian principles. Manifestation is
emblematic of Gough's anger at the colonial past and expresses the right
to refuse the reconciliatory politics of 'sorry' and the pressure to
forgive, to reach settlement and 'move on'. [Gough's anger is neither
unproductive nor irrational. Rather, in line with Coulthard's position,
her stance is a form of political outrage and a sign of critical
consciousness]{.underline}.35 Gough rejects the rubric of reconciliation
in the face of Tasmania's 'genocidal history, \[where\] ... Tasmanian
Aboriginal people have been subjected to the term "conciliation" for
generations, but not its practice'.36 In this refutation, Gough eschews
any notion of a break between the past and the present, and links the
contemporary reconciliation movement to the 'Great Conciliation' of
1832, a moment of settler triumph that marked the end of the Black Wars
in Van Diemen's Land between settlers and Aboriginal peoples.37 [Gough's
declaration also speaks to reconciliation fatigue]{.underline}, with the
suggestion that [it is an exhausted politics with sorely diminished
returns]{.underline}. For Gough, [the 'genocide' of Aboriginal people in
Tasmania renders reconciliation impossible.]{.underline} The Black War
resulted in the almost wholesale slaughter of Aboriginal peoples on the
island in a settler land war that many have argued was indeed genocidal.
At the time of contact in 1803, it was estimated that around
6,000--8,000 people lived on Trowunna (the Aboriginal name for
Tasmania), but that number was rapidly reduced to a remnant population.
By 1838 only around 60 people had survived, mainly to be exiled against
their will to northerly Flinders Island in the Bass Strait.38 As the
cover image of this book shows, Gough's artwork Manifestation delivers
an incendiary performance of resistance. Gough points to the repressive
tendencies of the reconciliation paradigm, one that, in this case, is
especially potent in Tasmania, with its highly intertwined history of
violence and conciliation deployed as complementary modes of colonial
governance, a theme to which I now turn.

#### Negotiations empirically fail

"Treaties between the Eastern Shawnee Tribe and the United States:
Contracts between Sovereign Governments",
<https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2875875//> RC)

The History and Law of Treaty-Making Between Indian Nations and the
United States: Indian treaty rights are often hotly contested issues
because some people perceive them as giving Indian "special rights."
[These property rights have often been vigorously opposed by state
officials and issues about tribal treaties are regularly in the news.
Many people misunderstand the nature of treaties,]{.underline} the
promises that were given therein, and the reservations that were formed
by treaties. [For the most part, native governments and peoples were not
"given" rights or land by the United States in treaties. Instead,
through political and contract-like negotiations, tribes reserved rights
they already owned and traded other rights with the United
States]{.underline}. In 1905, the [U.S. Supreme Court clearly showed its
understanding of the true nature of Indian treaties: "the treaty
was]{.underline} not a grant of rights to the Indians, [but a grant of
rights from them]{.underline}---[a reservation of those not
granted."]{.underline} Thus, **[in treaty-making, tribes were giving up
certain rights they already owned in lands, resources, and assets in
exchange for payments, promises, and protection from the United
States.]{.underline}** The [Indian nations agreed to sell some of their
property rights while they preserved other assets they already possessed
and owned,and wanted to retain.]{.underline} It is obvious, then, why
American Indian homelands are called "reservations" and why the lands of
the First Nations in Canada, for example, are called "reserves."
[Moreover, it is well recognized that Indian treaties are contracts
between the United States and Indian nations. The Supreme Court has
recognized this fact as already quoted above.]{.underline} And, in fact,
several of the ESTO treaties expressly name the Tribe and the United
States as "the contracting parties."5 Consequently, [treaties are
correctly analyzed under both contract law and international law
principles.]{.underline} Long before Europeans arrived in North America,
Indian nations were dealing politically and diplomatically with other
native governments through negotiations and consensual arrangements. [As
mentioned in the introduction, once European countries began attempting
to colonize North America, they uniformly followed the recognized
pattern of dealing with Indian nations through governmental and
political means via treaty-making.]{.underline} France, Holland, Spain,
and England, and their [colonial governments, signed scores and even
hundreds of treaties with American Indian nations. Once the United
States was created, it naturally adopted the accepted practice of
dealing with tribal nations as governments and through
treaties.]{.underline} Under the Continental Congress, the United States
negotiated its first Indian treaty with the Delaware Nation in 1778.
This Congress respectfully requested permission to cross Delaware
territory to attack the British at Fort Detroit during the Revolutionary
War. In this treaty, the United States even asked the Delaware to
consider joining the Union of the thirteen states as a separate state.7
After winning the war, the new United States government, now known as
the Articles of Confederation Congress, was at first far less solicitous
of tribes. This Congress signed eight treaties with Indian nations in
1784-1789. But at first, this Confederation Congress approached the
tribes with a very bellicose attitude because many tribes had supported
the British in the Revolutionary War. In fact, the U.S. claimed that it
had "conquered" the tribes by defeating England and that under
international law tribal lands were now forfeited to the United States.
That argument was vigorously disputed by Indian nations and it did not
help the United States relationship with the tribes. Thus, in 1795,
Secretary of War Timothy Pickering specifically instructed U.S. treaty
commissioners to drop any "conquest" claims and to strive to reach fair
diplomatic agreements with tribal governments.8 Once the current United
States government commenced operations under the new Constitution in the
spring of 1789, President George Washington and his administration dealt
with tribal governments and treated Indian treaties in the same manner
and with the same respect as they did international treaties with
foreign powers. The U.S. ultimately entered 375 treaties with Indian
tribes from 1778 to 1871[. In these treaties, the United States
negotiated cessions of land, recognized other areas of land usually
known as "reservations" which the tribal governments reserved to
themselves, and respected the self- governing powers of Indian
nations.]{.underline} Even though [Congress ended treaty-making with
tribes in 1871, the preexisting treaties are still in effect today and
contain promises which still bind the United States.]{.underline} In
fact, [under the Constitution, treaties are "the supreme Law of the
Land."]{.underline} In addition, [the United States continues to deal
with the tribal nations on a political basis to this day.]{.underline}
The [United States developed fairly standard procedures for proposing,
negotiating, and ratifying Indian treaties.]{.underline} We will see
many of these procedures used in the specific Eastern Shawnee treaties
and agreements discussed in section III below. [But it is also helpful
to note here the standardized and generalized procedures the United
States developed for Indian treaty-making. Tribal treaties were most
often negotiated by U.S. commissioners who were officially appointed by
the executive branch and funded by appropriations from
Congress.]{.underline} [Commissioners were then instructed to travel to
specific tribes to attempt to reach agreements on certain
objectives.]{.underline} [The United States was almost always seeking
land sales (cessions) from tribes and also was often trying to control
tribal trade, attempting to keep the peace, and settling grievances
Indians had with American settlers who were invading tribal
lands.]{.underline} Occasionally, Indian leaders traveled to Washington
D.C. for negotiating sessions and sometimes Indian nations requested the
United States to treaty with them. But [in the vast majority of
situations, the U.S. sought out the tribes. Federal treaty commissioners
were usually given fairly specific instructions on what to seek from the
tribes.]{.underline} Many of them kept detailed notes or journals of the
treaty negotiations to record what was discussed at the sessions. These
journals and signed treaties were then submitted to the Secretary of
War, and later to the Secretary of Interior after the U.S. Department of
the Interior was created in 1849. The Secretary would then submit the
proposed treaty to the President who, if he approved, would send it to
the Senate for consideration. [The Constitution provides for the
President to negotiate and draft treaties but they must be ratified by a
two-thirds vote in the Senate before they become binding on the United
States]{.underline}.11 **[There are several practices that were
regularly used by U.S. treaty commissioners that raise serious questions
about the meaning and fairness of American Indian
treaties]{.underline}**. First, questions arise about almost all Indian
treaties whether the "chief" or tribe that signed a particular treaty
even had the authority or right to sell the lands and surrender the
various rights addressed in the treaty. Numerous allegations have been
made by historians and tribal citizens that federal commissioners,
including ones that signed treaties with the ESTO, purposely selected
the "chiefs" they wanted to negotiate with, or picked a specific tribe
to speak for others. William Henry Harrison, for example, who negotiated
three treaties with the ancestors of the Eastern Shawnee Tribe and other
tribes in 1803, 1814, and 1815, and many other U.S. treaty negotiators,
were well known to select the tribal chiefs they would negotiate with,
and then would only give gifts to those chiefs who signed treaties.12
Second, all Indian treaties, including the ones with the Eastern
Shawnee, were negotiated and written in English. Hence, Indians had to
trust that the U.S. commissioners and the interpreters were telling them
the truth. In addition, tribal leaders were expected to understand
exactly the legal meaning and significance of the English words used in
the treaties. Third, the federal commissioners had the assistance of
trained personnel and, for example, in regards Indian treaties in the
Pacific Northwest, the U.S. commissioner even had a Harvard trained
attorney on his staff. Fourth, federal negotiators were known to badger
and coerce tribal leaders to sign treaties and often alcohol flowed
freely at treaty sessions. The federal commissioner at the Wapakoneta
Shawnee August 1831 treaty negotiation in Ohio apparently even refused
to take the time to read the full treaty to the tribal leaders but still
tried to force them to sign it. Suspiciously, treaty interpreters and
other Americans often received grants of tribal lands in these treaties,
and, fifth, in many of the treaty negotiations, including again the
Wapakoneta Shawnee in August 1831, Indians and Indian leaders were
heavily influenced by businessmen who claimed the tribal government
and/or individual Indians owned them enormous debts for past purchases.
One eyewitness at the Wapakoneta Shawnee negotiation in 1831 claims that
traders paid bribes to some Shawnees and provided alcohol to federal
officials and Shawnees to get them to agree to a treaty that ensured the
traders were paid for blatantly false claims.13

the Connections between Education and Sovereignty for ka Lähui
Hawai'I\]//Mberhe

The decolonization and indigenization of education, which may be
strategized and implemented through Indigenous critical pedagogy,
requires several steps. Despite the linear appearance of their
presentation here, these steps should be thought of as occurring fluidly
and recursively. First, we must come to an understanding that **[Western
notions of knowledge, education, and research, especially those that
come from a positivist paradigm, are in no way absolute.]{.underline}**
Meyer (2008), [for example]{.underline}, discusses the [limitations of
Eurocentric empiricism and scientific objectivity in the construction of
knowledge.]{.underline} As she theorizes a Hawaiian conception of
meaning-making which involves three parts, the body, mind, and spirit,
she notes that The body idea in the triangulation of meaning is what
science has cornered. It is expressed through sensation via objective
measurement and evaluation. It is a valuable and rigorous part in the
triangulation of meaning and the center of most research processes...The
problem was that we assumed all the world could be described this way.
(p. 226) In other words, **[although there is some value in what we can
know empirically, there is also value in the knowledge we can encounter
through other means.]{.underline}** And, whereas [we have been taught
through positivism that we can only know what can be detected through
the use of our five senses, this is not the only way to know ourselves,
to know others, or to know the world]{.underline}. Furthermore, if
[there are different ways of knowing than those presented to us via
Western empiricism,]{.underline} then [there are also different ways of
constructing new knowledge through research]{.underline}. Though the
scientific method teaches researchers to utilize objectivity and
distance in their work, such concepts can be liabilities when conducting
research within Indigenous contexts (Mataira, Matsuoka, & Morelli, 2005;
Meyer, 2008). [From an Indigenous perspective, research that originates
from within Indigenous communities and involves trust, communication,
and collaboration within these communities leads to the production of
knowledge that is both authentic and useful]{.underline} (Henry & Pene,
2001; Kawakami, Aton, Cram, Lai, & Porina, 2007; Mataira et al., 2005).
In Meyer's (2008) words, "objectivity is its own limitation" (p. 227).
Second, we must utilize education as a space through which we may
develop better understandings about our selves, our histories, our
traditions and, subsequently, secure foundations for our futures. L. T.
Smith (1999) suggests that relearning 213 Reyes \| Indigenous Critical
Pedagogy and ka LÄhui Hawai'i and reconceptualizing the past is a vital
step to the decolonization process for Indigenous people since
Westerners have told only one-sided accounts of our histories for so
long. In transforming the knowledge of our histories through critical
reexamination, we can also be better prepared to transform our
contemporary identities. Grande (2008) asserts that Indigenous peoples
should collectively examine their own communities and decide for
themselves what beliefs and behaviors are acceptable and essential to
their community identities. This might include critically examining the
ways in which even some of what we consider to be cultural traditions
have come to reflect colonial values and norms through time (Denetdale,
2006). Through engaging in such a mindful, spiritual process of
reinvention and self-definition, Indigenous peoples exercise their
rights as revolutionary agents (Grande, 2008). [They empower themselves
to push back against Eurocentric mainstream ideologies and create
culturally responsive educational spaces, placing their own values,
knowledge, worldviews, and concerns at its center]{.underline} (Denzin &
Lincoln, 2008; Trinidad, 2011). Within these educational spaces,
**[Indigenous peoples can arm themselves with]{.underline}** what
Mataira and associates (2005) call **["empirical ammunition" for
validating their realities]{.underline}** and preserving their
traditions for future generations (Grande, 2008). Thus, whereas critical
pedagogy might encourage individuals to imagine a utopian future unlike
anything before seen, Indigenous critical pedagogy might encourage
Indigenous communities to envision a hopeful future "that lives in
contingency with the past---one that trusts the beliefs and
understandings of our ancestors, the power of traditional knowledge, and
the possibilities of new understandings" (Grande, 2008, p. 250).

[There are limits to this mode of accumulation]{.underline}. **[Settler
colonialism may be a "structure," but structures can be torn
down]{.underline}**. True, the redundant [populations are increasing,
but so are the effects of an overaccumulation crisis that is becoming
more and more visible]{.underline}. **[Financial bubbles, a generalized
fall in commodity prices, and stubbornly anemic economic growth are
signals that accumulation without reproduction is unsustainable in the
long term]{.underline}**.21 When it comes to a search for
sustainability, there is again much to be learned from indigenous
knowledges. That "[degrowth]{.underline}" as a possibility (see, for
example, Latouche 2010) actually [reproduces indigenous approaches to
economic management]{.underline} should be noted. An unprecedented [flow
of refugees moving toward Europe demonstrates that the global disposable
populations will not accept the new dispensation without
resisting]{.underline}. [This mode of domination]{.underline} in the
"creditocratic" age does not recognize and suppresses our sovereign
collective capabilities as it appropriates whatever secondary "commons"
we may still hold.22It w[ants what we have but is not interested in
reproducing us as labor.]{.underline} [It does not demand that we
sell]{.underline} it [in exchange for wages;]{.underline} some of us may
still do (I do), but [this is no longer the main point]{.underline}.23
Rosemary Hennessy (2016, 259) notes: "As [capital accumulation from
'immediate life' advances, social reproduction is being eviscerated and
value is becoming increasingly dissociated from surplus
labor."]{.underline} [Debt]{.underline}, it should be remembered, [was
one crucial way in which indigenous peoples globally were dispossessed
of their lands]{.underline} (see Banner 2007), and [debt today has
profoundly spatial implications]{.underline} (see Harker 2017). 24 It is
significant that [a call for considering the spatiality of
debt]{.underline} rather than its temporal characteristics (i.e., debt
as simply "present consumption bought with future labour") [should arise
from the analysis of a settler colony and its operation]{.underline}
(i.e., from occupied Palestine). Even if these observations are only
partially correct, [formulating a response should become a
priority]{.underline}. As **[indebtedness, underconsumption, and
overcapitalization move to center stage]{.underline}** (see, e.g.,
Joseph 2014), **[settler colonialism as a specific mode of domination
should enter the analytical frame]{.underline}**. After all, Wakefield
proposed [settler colonialism as a way out of what he had interpreted as
an unprecedented overcapitalization crisis]{.underline} (he was
especially concerned about the falling rate of profits, something that
should sound familiar to observers of the current conjuncture; see
Piterberg and Veracini 2015). It is perhaps no accident that [neoliberal
rhetorical stances are now routinely used in relation to indigenous
peoples and that neglect of collective obligations toward indigenous
constituencies can be framed in the language of self-reliance and
self-determination]{.underline} (see Altman 2010; Bessire 2014;
Strakosch 2015). We may be facing a palindrome rather than an
irreversible progression: [if the ultimate product]{.underline} (if not
the method) [of settler-colonial processes is the state, then in
important ways neoliberal orders are implicitly already settler
colonial]{.underline}. [The state typically follows the "closing" of the
frontier]{.underline}, the closing of an unsettled state that is
superseded by the state; [the current "abdication" of the
state]{.underline} in order [to pursue and defend private property begs
the question of a possible return to "frontier"
arrangements]{.underline} (see Sugg 2015).25 [Two]{.underline} unrelated
currently developing "[frontiers]{.underline}" could be mentioned here.
The [current "NGOization" of the structures of international governance
is designed to compensate for the apparent failure of the postcolonial
state]{.underline} (see Choudry and Kapoor 2013). [NGOs are therefore a
constituent part of the global settler present in a growing assemblage
of stateless frontiers]{.underline}. Also [foreshadowing]{.underline}

#### The 1ac operates through the logic of settler futurity through representing "extinction" and thus the termination of the settler to sustain their existence

First, what exactly does the term **["settler
futurity]{.underline}***"* mean? Since I am no scholar on settler
colonialism and imperialism, here is how Tuck & Gaztambide-Fernández
define settler futurity in their book Curriculum, Replacement, and
Settler Futurity: "Settler Futurity. The settler colonial curricular
project of replacement is invested in settler futurity, or what Andrew
Baldwin calls the "permanent virtuality" of the settler on stolen land
(2012, p. 173)". ..."which always indivisibly means the continued and
complete eradication of the original inhabitants of contested land.
Anything that seeks to recuperate and not interrupt settler colonialism,
to reform the settlement and incorporate Indigenous peoples into the
multicultural settler colonial nation state is fettered to settler
futurity." Essentially, it'[s the preservation of settler bodies
while the erasure of indigenous bodies is completely accepted or
ignored]{.underline}. But how does this manifest in current society? You
may have heard of **["utilitarianism,"]{.underline}** or a moral
doctrine that **[favors]{.underline}** benefiting **[the most amount of
people]{.underline}**. In these types of decision making factors, it
is often [the "settler" ]{.underline}who [gets to make the choice of
which route to take]{.underline}: should we [build train
tracks]{.underline} all [over Native American
territory ]{.underline}to [enhance transportation for all Americans,
or ]{.underline}should
[wekeep ]{.underline}the [Treaty ]{.underline}of [Greenville ]{.underline}and [allow
other European countries ]{.underline}to [surpass us]{.underline}? And
in a non-colonial context: should we nuke Japan to officially stop WWII,
or should we wait an unknown amount of time for the war to
end? But [often ]{.underline}in these situations, the [two
choices ]{.underline}are [not weighed
equally]{.underline}--the [side ]{.underline}that [benefits]{.underline}
[the preservation of ]{.underline}the [most settler
bodies ]{.underline}is [un-proportionally
favored]{.underline}. Similarly, attempts at avoiding extinction
scenarios and the obsession of the settler to avoid their own demise,
often trade off with the lives of indigenous peoples: The containment of
the Indigenous in reservations is key for economic development; only
eradicating their culture will prevent barbarism and danger;
yada yada yada. When asked, they hold a guise and say *"*[but preventing
extinction and war is beneficial for all people]{.underline}!",
but [isn't this ]{.underline}the same concept as the ["All Lives
Matter" debate? Even if everyone stays alive biologically, Indigenous
peoples face daily psychological warfare, decreased quality of life,
heightened suicide rates, and cultural genocide that essentially means
the loss of identity]{.underline}. If even their biological lives don't
have as much meaning as the one of the settler, then [indigenous folk
have no way of benefiting in any situation.]{.underline}* *Furthermore,
these extinction scenarios have so little probability yet they are still
preferred above the status quo structural impacts; here we are worrying
about nuclear war even though deterrence, interdependence, international
norms, and pure science all indicate that North Korea would hardly have
a chance of bombing the United States, while Indigenous peoples across
the globe wake up each day in fear of their culture slowly disappearing
until they are completely assimilated and lost from any distinct
identity... The **[settler is phenomenal at imagining scenarios that
threaten their existence, and does everything
possible ]{.underline}***(create policies, establish
organizations, etc) ***[to ensure that they will continue to exist.
Their futurity lacks space for the indigenous:]{.underline}** "this is
my home and I intend to live in it." [But since when did they ever
consider how the perpetuation of the dominant culture, of the settler
futurity, is killing the identityof the indigenous?  ]{.underline}

#### Attempts to deconstruct structures of power at a local level ignore the hegemonic paradigms that are the root cause of problematic issues

**Alcoff 12** (Linda M. Alcoff is the Professor of Philosophy at Hunter
College and the CUNY Graduate Center. "Enrique Dussel's Transmodernism,"
[https://escholarship.org/uc/item/58k9k17t
//](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/58k9k17t%20//) nsp

This difficulty gets at the key problem for the revisionary shift at the
meta-level that Dussel wants to make: how do we move to a decentralized,
pluriversal (rather than universal) approach that avoids relativism?
[How do we avoid losing the ability for critique, and especially for
macro-level critiques that will be adequate to the macro-level epistemic
structures of the coloniality of power]{.underline}? How do we construct
a pluriverse epistemology in a politically meaningful way? [Any
overarching normative criterion for inclusion in the pluriverse is
contradictory to the idea of pluriversality.]{.underline} Jürgen
Habermas's attempts to produce overarching norms come under the
understandable criticism that these work again to be exclusionary of
those who cannot or don't want to be discursively engaged, who cannot or
refuse to accept the terms of engagement, and this would include some
indigenous groups, for example, who want disengagement and autonomy more
than anything else. Yet without an overarching criterion of inclusion or
evaluation, Dussel is right that pluriversality has no clear relation to
liberation. Dussel's worries with Foucault are based precisely in this
concern: he suggests that [if we stay only at the level of the local, we
cannot develop a macro-account of hegemonic power. He asks: how
can]{.underline} Foucault's [local critiques work without challenging
the meta-narratives]{.underline}, and macro-practices, [that subordinate
local knowledges]{.underline}? "One must recognize that [power is
mutually and relationally constituted between social
subjects]{.underline}, but that, in any case, [the power of the state or
the power of the hegemonic nation]{.underline} (such as the United
States) [continues to exist"]{.underline} (Dussel, "Philosophy" 339).
[Local praxis does not make it possible to theorize the relations
between local issues as relations between parts to a whole, and to
understand local problems and challenges as often connected to larger,
non-local processes.]{.underline} Dussel rightfully argues that [we need
a new paradigm, not simply a scattered guerrilla war]{.underline}. The
concept of the transmodern is meant, in part, to allow for a broad, even
global relationality among elements, so none are irreducibly local. When
we make cultures or knowledge systems irreducibly local, we truly risk
ahistorical reifications. [We risk losing sight of how our
representations of local practices or knowledges may be constituted
through imperial sign systems, or, in other words, mistaking the local
as a]{.underline} solipsistic [spontaneous emergence, rather than
implicated\-\--at least in its representations and how it is
understood\-\--within a larger colonial semiosis.]{.underline} Thus, [we
must avoid fetishizing the local]{.underline}. The potential relativism
of pluriversality is avoided, then, not by imposing a uniform, universal
standard or method or set of norms, but by developing provisional
meta-narratives of global history that can illuminate local conditions
and relations. What provides the normative criterion within
pluriversality is just this meta-narrative of an interconnected history.
This is not a transcendental criterion of rationality, a la Habermas,
but a more dynamic and decentered notion of the developments of reason
in relationality. [Dussel's macro-frame]{.underline} of the
metanarrative, [and]{.underline} in particular [his metanarrative of the
transmodern, operates to keep the colonial context ever-present in the
analytical process, while decentralizing the idea of the modern and
removing its vanguard global status]{.underline}. There is a coherent
historical narrative that Dussel gives here to be sure---modernity phase
one and modernity phase two---but there is no uniquely privileged site
where the emergence of rationality occurs, or the development of a
reflexive critical consciousness that begins to assess one's conventions
of belief and practice. Reflective consciousness is an equal opportunity
phenomenon, as is blind dogmatism and willful ignorance. Meta-narratives
of history have explanatory value; they are offered as explanations for
progression, development, or relations. The concept of the transmodern
is a concept with much greater explanatory value than the myth of
Eurocentric modernity, and, because of its pluri- and trans-versa
character, it avoids the exclusionary, hierarchical effects of
totalizing systems. Although it provides a check on the potential
relativism that can occur when we reject centralized models, the concept
of the transmodern is meant to provide an overarching criterion of
evaluation for the philosophy of liberation, despite the fact that it is
Dussel's main alternative meta-narrative to the meta-narratives of
Eurocentrism. It is motivated by its descriptive project, to produce a
better ideational representation of history and social formations in the
colonial era. In more recent work, Dussel has suggested that it is out
of this historical re-description that we can map the productive sites
for the most critical, irruptive work. The transmodern meta-narrative
suggests a recipe for moving forward not through universalist procedures
justified via a transcendental argument outside of cultural or
historical specificity, but via an analysis of how and where cultural
dialogues can occur most productively given the way in which the current

#### Pragmatism is better than idealist methods of attacking injustices -- avoid the pitfalls of the alternative which allow for injustices to be simplified and for concrete manifestations of injustices to be ignored

THERE HAS BEEN A RECENT RESURGENCE OF pragmatism1 in sociopolitical
theory, one in which [pragmatism is]{.underline} presented as offering
[an alternative and promising approach to nonideal theories of
justice]{.underline}. This may seem ironic since the record of the
classical pragmatists on being explicit about justice or the injustices
of their time in their philosophical corpus is a mixed one at best.
However, this has not stopped recent philosophers from continuing to
draw from the philosophical resources in this tradition to address the
injustices of today (e.g., Cornel West, Eddie Glade, Shannon Sullivan,
Melvin Rogers, Jose Medina, Elizabeth Anderson). The title of the 2014
SAAP presidential address by Ken Stikkers was "Toward a Pragmatic
Understanding of Racism."

What is it about this philosophical tradition that seems worth
reconstructing for today, in spite of its shortcomings? The short answer
is pragmatism is a metaphilosophy guided by a normative vision of
democracy. This paper argues that this metaphilosophy is worth
reconstruction, but that, in order to advance it, we need to re-examine
it by making explicit the basic tenets of this approach to injustices in
the world and determining how it differs from other similar approaches.
In this reconstructive task, we would do well to revisit some of John
Dewey's and Jane Addams's insights in regard to proper methodology for
philosophy in addressing social problems. In the brief characterizations
of pragmatism by Elizabeth Anderson and others, its more radical aspects
have been left out.2 This raises some interesting challenges for
philosophers today, including Anderson, who claim to practice an
"empirical" nonideal approach to actual injustices. The pragmatists'
approach should be distinguished from [nonideal theories]{.underline}
whose starting point is some grand historical account of injustice or a
sociological structural account of injustice. Pragmatism's most
important contribution to the development of nonideal theories today, in
fact, points to the ways in which these views \[End Page 58\] [are not
immune from making]{.underline} the same [mistakes]{.underline} as the
most universalistabsolutist approaches in sociopolitical [theory such as
oversimplification of or blindness to aspects of concrete
injustices.]{.underline} [The pragmatist's methodological prescription
to be sensitive to the concrete problems of injustice turns out to
be]{.underline} a more [demanding]{.underline} and "unorthodox"
prescription than Anderson and others think.

What Kind of Nonideal Sociopolitical Theory is Pragmatism?

Is the fact that pragmatism as a philosophy does not have a theory of
justice a weakness or a strength? There are metaphilosophical reasons
that explain Dewey's relative silence about justice. A theory of justice
is as much a dangerous mistake in philosophy as it is a theory of truth,
and for the same reasons. They are both part of a philosophical quest
that usually ends up committing the "philosophical fallacy"3 and showing
the ineptness of philosophy in helping to ameliorate concrete problems.
[Pragmatism is committed to basing philosophy in lived experience, and,
in social philosophy, this means a shift from the theoretical
construction of a substantive normative conception of justice to a more
contextualist, problem-centered, empirical, and inquiry-oriented
approach.]{.underline} A [pragmatist's approach]{.underline} must be
distinguished from, and [is critical of, approaches]{.underline} to
justice [that:]{.underline}

[(1). start with a]{.underline} theory or [theoretical abstraction about
what justice is]{.underline};

[(2).]{.underline} [start with the assumption of a noncontextual
ahistorical universal point of view]{.underline} (the "Archimedean
standpoint"4); and

(3). start with or presuppose a political ideology or even a political
agenda.

But there are other contemporary approaches that reject these same
views. In contrast to these views, it has been said that [**the proper
approach should be nonideal, historical, contextual, and
empirical**.]{.underline} Philosophers like Amartya Sen and Charles W.
Mills have argued that [ideal-type approaches are useless, ideological,
and may function as blinders to actual injustices, or mask existing
oppressions.]{.underline} Instead, nonideal theorists
[insist]{.underline} that [political philosophy should be empirical and
realistic, and should start with the actual circumstances in which we
find ourselves. The diversity of views within nonideal theory includes
the approaches to philosophy of Marxists, feminists, critical theorists,
critical race theorists, and Latin American liberation philosophers.
Many of these views seem to be in agreement]{.underline} [that a proper
approach to injustices]{.underline} (for example, racism or inequality)
[should start with]{.underline} either or both: \[End Page 59\]

(4). a theory of historical evil: [a theoretical-historical account of
injustices]{.underline} in the world or of a particular problem of
injustice at a particular time in the history of a particular country,
nation, or civilization (e.g., the history of white supremacy or of
colonization of the Americas); or

(5). [an empirical diagnosis provided]{.underline} [by]{.underline} the
social sciences via [studies and analysis of the causes of the concrete
problems of injustice.]{.underline} For example, philosophy should begin
with a sociological structural account of the systematic disadvantages
imposed on people because of their race, class, or gender in our
society.

Anderson places pragmatism in the nonideal camp of the contemporary
ideal versus nonideal debate.5 She identifies the pragmatists' approach
with (5) when she asserts that "**[philosophy must start from a
diagnosis of injustices in our actual world, rather than from a picture
of an ideal world]{.underline}**" (Anderson 3). I argue that neither (4)
nor (5) captures what pragmatism believes to be the proper
philosophical-empirical approach to the problems of injustice.

It is easy to see why (4) and (5) could be considered "empirical"
starting points compared to the imaginary and theoretical abstractions
of ideal theory. Since [pragmatism is committed to
empiricism]{.underline}, it is very sympathetic to the type of views in
(4) and (5), and, in fact, it welcomes both historical accounts and
scientific results as part of its resources. However, what distinguishes
it from other nonideal approaches is a more radical empiricism and
contextualism that is not captured by the above tenets, one that issues
important methological warnings to all nonideal theories.

One analytical insight of a governmentality approach McKee highlights is
the productive nature of power. Foucault's "concern lay in the different
means by which human beings are made subjects" (McKee 2009, p. 470).
This relates to my study in two ways. First, my thinking about settler
colonialism has been shaped by Indigenous scholars who have written
about the importance of considering the productive nature of settler
colonialism (Stark 2016, no page numbers available; Coulthard 2014, p.
152). Second, though the present study strategically brackets the
question of subject formation, [consultation and accommodation policy
contributes to producing people as subjects by **setting out categories
people may belong to, and limiting the ways members of each category may
participate in consultation**]{.underline} and accommodation processes.
These categories are not exclusive to consultation and accommodation
policy; [they are related to wider social and political
contexts.]{.underline}13 [These categories shape the conditions of
possibility for action]{.underline} and focusing on them allows us to
see the productive nature of power.

This thesis explores technologies of power that operate in British
Columbia's policy for consultation with Indigenous peoples about
proposed land and resource decisions. I use the concept of settler
colonialism to analyze the contents of British Columbia's consultation
and accommodation policy to assess whether and how the policy is
oriented toward settler-colonial relationships. I analyze a British
Columbia provincial policy document entitled Updated Procedures for
Meeting Legal Obligations When Consulting First Nations Interim. By
focusing on this policy document, I examine how [power operates through
settler state law and policy. I]{.underline} critically analyze [three
technologies of power that operate in British Columbia's
consultation]{.underline} and accommodation [policy: the administrative
law principle of procedural fairness, recognition politics, and the
assumption of legitimate settler sovereignty.]{.underline} I consider
how the policy's focus on process reveals colonial power dynamics.
Furthermore, I argue that [recognition politics operate in the policy
because Indigenous difference is recognized and some space is made for
Indigenous actors to exercise authority, however **the settler state
retains final decisionmaking authority, which shows a colonial hierarchy
of power.**]{.underline} Finally, I consider how [the assumption of
legitimate settler state sovereignty that underlies B.C.'s law and
policy is a source of authority through which the settler state has
various types of power under the policy, including definitional power
and final decision-making power.]{.underline}

#### The use of the term "native" groups non-indigenous people from in a settler state with people of indigenous descent, exacerbating colonialism

**FNSP 09** (First Nations Studies Program, First Nations and Indigenous
Studies at the University of British Columbia, "Terminology", Indigenous
Foundations, 2009, Date Accessed: 6/26/19,
https://indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca/terminology/#native )//SR

"Native" is a general term that refers to a person or thing that has
originated from a particular place. The term "native" does not denote a
specific Aboriginal ethnicity (such as First Nation, Métis, or Inuit).
In the United States, the term "Native American" is in common usage to
describe Aboriginal peoples. In Canada, the term "Aboriginal" or
"Indigenous" is generally preferred to "Native." Some may feel that
["native" has a negative connotation and is outdated. This term can also
be problematic in certain contexts, as some non-Aboriginal peoples born
in a settler state may argue that they, too, are "native."]{.underline}
Is it okay to say "native"? While ["native"]{.underline} is generally
not considered offensive, [it may still hold negative connotations for
some. Because it is a very general, overarching term, it does not
account for any distinctiveness between various Aboriginal
groups.]{.underline} If you are referencing a specific group, [it is
generally considered more respectful to use another term that more
specifically denotes which peoples you are referring to.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- AT: Ontological

#### Positing settler colonialism as ontological and immutable allows settlers to absolve their political responsibility towards its destruction

\*People in positions of power use theories that settler colonialism is
immutable to justify not doing anything about it

Firstly, by disturbing settler colonialism's narratives of [progress,
SCT attributes a peculiar suspended temporality to the settler
project.]{.underline} This can portray settler colonialism as an
inevitable structure likely to exist across time -- the fact that the
past persists in the present implies that this past will also persist in
the future. Foundational scholar Patrick Wolfe has been labelled 'very
much a structuralist stuck in a poststructuralist world'. 63 As we have
outlined, [this structuralism]{.underline} is particularly useful in
identifying the operation of political hierarchies. However, it [can
also excuse us from human political action in the present by presenting
this action as futile or already determined]{.underline}.[64 The role of
political activists is to wait for the structurally determined future,
and at most to prepare others for its arrival]{.underline}. **[The
particular challenge of SCT's analysis is that it does not give an
account of such a transformed future, or of the conditions for settler
colonialism's demise]{.underline}**. This can lead to a theoretical and
political impasse and result in a kind of colonial fatalism. Such
fatalism can be deployed to imply a moral equivalence between different
forms of settler political interaction with Indigenous people, and, at
its worst, to deny the legitimacy of Indigenous resistances.
[Structuralist narratives are able to posit radical change, but only if
this change is built into the structures they descr]{.underline}ibe --
for example because these structures are subject to internal
contradictions or are inherently unstable. [Settler colonial structures,
however, appear as highly stable and 'relatively impervious to regime
change']{.underline}. 65 Therefore, **[at the same moment settler
scholars finally see the depth and reach of settler colonialism in the
present they feel unable to find 'postsettler colonial
passages']{.underline}**. 66 [This tendency is reinforced by SCT's
capacity to identify significant commonalities in the objectives of
conservative and progressive policy approaches]{.underline}, as
discussed above. It shows that traditional 'decolonizing' pathways such
as treaty making, reconciliation and formal apologies may also serve
colonial ends by absorbing and extinguishing Aboriginal political
difference without disturbing the foundational structures of settler
dominance. As Australian anthropologist Deborah Bird Rose notes, [this
makes it 'difficult to offer a critique of the colonizing features
without calling into question the whole decolonizing
project]{.underline}'. 67 **[If every settler action is framed as always
already colonizing, then individuals are excused from anti-colonial
action in the present and Indigenous people are destined to be victims
of an unstoppable colonizing state]{.underline}**.68 As bell hooks
argues in relation to US race relations, **[this is useful to those in a
position of dominance]{.underline}**: '**[so many White people are eager
to believe racism cannot be changed because internalizing that
assumption downplays the issue of accountability. No responsibility need
be taken for not changing something if it is perceived as
immutable.']{.underline}** 69 [Is it possible that settlers are
particularly attracted to SCT precisely because it gives us a sense of
being intellectually committed to the end of colonialism while
simultaneously unable to act against our own privilege?]{.underline} As
a recent article concluded about the prospects for decolonization: I can
only assess this with a degree of gloom. I am yet to be convinced that
we can prevent indigenous disadvantage remaining structurally embedded
in society and through the state even after any kind of 'transition' or
'transformation'. At the same time, I fear decolonization. I am myself a
settler, like several of my ancestors before me, and I have nowhere else
to belong. [SCT's structuralism may serve these conflicted interests, in
allowing us to feel we have done all we can while facing the 'reality'
of an inevitable settler colonial future.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- AT: Refusal ALT

#### A politics of refusal sabatoges movements -- they foreclose political strategies of communication and pluralism that create effective strategies and instead push indigenous folk to remain subaltern

Anna Frances **Laing 15,** geography PhD candidate, "Territory,
resistance and struggles for the plurinational state: the spatial
politics of the TIPNIS Conflict,"
<http://theses.gla.ac.uk/5974/7/2015laingphd.pdf>) // nsp

The use of indigeneity as a common signifier has fostered mobilisation
across different ethnic groups. This process has been aided by NGOs and
técnicos (technical experts) that accompanied the Eighth and Ninth
Marches. NGO representatives facilitated meetings, provided training,
funded activities and constructed written announcements and texts. These
mediatory actors therefore helped to re-articulate the grievances of the
marchers under the banner of indigenous rights. This could be seen in
the writing of open letters to the government during both the Eighth and
Ninth Marches, made possible through the aid of technical experts from
one of the principle legal organisations defending indigenous rights in
Bolivia CEJIS (Centro de Estudios Jurídicos e Investigación Social;
Centre of Legal Studies and Social Investigation). Therefore, [in order
to]{.underline} 'speak' and [be heard,]{.underline} the [indigenous
peoples have to undergo a process of representation through the language
of legal rights]{.underline}. [They]{.underline} therefore [remain
'subaltern']{.underline} because their [attempts at self-representation
fall outside the 'the lines laid down by the official institutional
structures of representation']{.underline} (Spivak 1996: 306). Thus,
Glenn (2011) contends that [the UN Declaration on the Rights of
Indigenous Peoples]{.underline} is ironic since it [seeks the
recognition of alternative epistemologies through civic institutions
that have homogenising and universalising tendencies.
However]{.underline}, as Fabricant notes in her work with the Landless
Peasants Movement in Bolivia, [movements 'take NGO ideas and meld them
with]{.underline} their own [creative strategies to come up with
solutions that will work]{.underline} for their communities' (2012:
120). Moreover, Gustafson (2009b) offers a balanced interpretation of
the ways that NGOs offer a language and model for politicising
alternative worldviews. [The indigenous movement]{.underline}
[consciously reifies certain strategic essentialisms whilst at other
times actively resisting them.]{.underline} Indeed, indigenous
knowledges do not exist outside of other knowledge forms (Walsh 2002).
As Walsh argues '\[t[\]he efficacy of the movement]{.underline} in fact
[derives from its ability to]{.underline} construct and [use the
correspondences among various contemporary knowledge
positions]{.underline} \[...\] [in order to exercise political tactics
and strategies']{.underline} (2002: 71). **[A politics of refusal is
unlikely to advance indigenous demands]{.underline}**. As such, Hale
suggests an analytical framework based on the Gramscian notion of
articulation to [ask: will the subjugated knowledge and practices be
articulated within the dominant, and neutralised? Or will they occupy
the space opened from above while resisting its built in logic, connect
with others, toward 'transformative' cultural-political alternatives
that still cannot be fully imagined?]{.underline} (2002: 499). Indeed,
there is the danger that [identifying under a single]{.underline}
indigenous [label risks losing]{.underline} the [complexities and
processes that permeate the heterogeneous inter-ethnic collectivity of
the lowland indigenous movement.]{.underline} [This acts to
disembody]{.underline} the [identity claims from]{.underline} some of
the more [radical tangents of the movement.]{.underline} Mexican
anthropologist Miguel Alberto Bartolomé argues that [indigenous autonomy
should contemplate 'new modes of]{.underline} \[interethnic,
inter-cultural\] [social articulation that are more
egalitarian]{.underline} than existing \[ones\]' and that [a
multi-ethnic state 'should explore all possible paths in the search for
novel forms of conviviality between culturally distinct
groups']{.underline} (2005: 146 cited in Gustafson 2009a: 998). Escobar
similarly calls for a decolonisation that 'can be started in earnest
from a deessentialized perspective' (2008: 305). Indeed, the movement
seeks the recognition of plurality without the homogenisation of
indigenous cultures or ideologies or the ranking of difference that
necessarily works to subordinate some cultures and let others dominate.
This project of emancipatory societal transformation is an on-going
challenge for the lowland indigenous movement.

### 2AC -- AT: Pyschoanalysis

#### Psychoanalysis isn't universal and scaling it up to political conclusions is ineffective

**Rogers, 17**---Senior Lecturer in Criminology in the School of
Political Sciences at the University of Melbourne and Adjunct Professor
at Griffith Law School, Queensland (Juliet, "Is Psychoanalysis
Universal? Politics, Desire, and Law in Colonial Contexts," Political
Psychology, Vol. 38, No. 4, 2017, Accessed 7/4/19)//SR

[The presumption of a universal form of desire is an important starting
point for the analyst of any patient who arrives on the couch in the
psychoanalytic clinic. The psychoanalyst can only offer certain
parameters, with all their limitations. The patient, if the analyst
allows for an interrogation of their own forms of resistance, however,
can speak back to any frame of desire that the analyst presumes or
proposes]{.underline}. And the analyst---if Jacques Lacan's thoughts on
resistance are taken seriously (Lacan, 2007, p. 497; Rogers, 2016, pp.
183--187)---must listen, attend, learn, and adapt. But when the desires
of subjects are extended into the political realm, when the wants and
needs of every subject are presumed to articulate with a psychoanalytic
notion of universal desire, then something is lost. That something might
be called the desire of the other, or it might not be called desire at
all. The desire of the other is not easily seen in the wake of European
Enlightenment that has engulfed the imagination of psychoanalytic and
political theorists and practitioners alike. It is not easily seen, and
it is not easily conversed with when epistemological work presumes a
trajectory of desire and then applies it. In this application, there is
little space for a radically other performance of politics as action or
imagination to appear. The subject who is subsumed into this
imagination---the subject Gayatri Spivak (1996)1 describes as "the Other
of Europe"---has little opportunity to do more than "utter" under the
weight of its imagined subjectivity. As Spivak (1999) says: \[I\]n the
constitution of that Other of Europe, great care was taken to obliterate
the textual ingredients with which such a subject could cathect, could
occupy (invest?) its itinerary---not only by ideological and scientific
production, but also by the institution of the law. (p. 266)
[Psychoanalysis is as guilty of exercising such a form of "great care"
as many of the occupations of French intellectuals that Spivak has
criticized for doing so. Psychoanalysis, with its attention to the many
forms of the unconscious, can appear otherwise than guilty of this. It
can appear more open, generous, and curious about the many forms that
desire can take. In its later forms of attention to a politically
constituted "symbolic order" under the guidance of Lacan (2007), it can
also appear more attentive to the particularities of desires informed by
a politics of the time. I argue here, however, that attention is already
constituted by an imagination of a subject who wants, who needs, who
desires objects, things, rights, in a mode which cannot not start from a
point of origin, and a particular political form of origin which then
precludes the recognition---in both the clinic and in political
analysis2 ---of other forms of desire, "with which such a subject could
cathect, could occupy (invest?) its itinerary."]{.underline} When
practices such as political psychoanalysis presume a particular form of
desire, what is at stake in this constitution of desire is the political
subject or the Other of Europe who cannot "speak," in Spivak's terms.
What is lost might be called radical desire; it might be an itinerary
which is cathected or invested otherwise, and, as such, it might not be
recognizable in psychoanalysis or in contemporary political psychology
at all. The nonrecognition of the Other of Europe, in her many forms, is
a consistent political problem---documented often and insistently by
critical race and postcolonial analysts such as Spivak, but also Sanjay
Seth, Leila Gandhi, Chandra Talpade Mohanty, Aileen Moreton-Robinson,
Elizabeth Povinelli, Ashis Nandy, Christine Black, and Homi Bhabha. Such
nonrecognition, however, when repostulated in political psychoanalysis
has another effect. The trajectory of the symptoms of political
practice---including desires for law, justice, particular election
outcomes, rights, socioeconomic configurations, or even for the
formation of political structures themselves (democracy being only
one)--- presume a form of desire that refers to, and endures in, its
constitution. As Spivak (1999) notes in her critique of power and desire
as universal: \[S\]o is "desire" misleading because of its paleonomic
burden of an originary phenomenal passion---from philosophical
intentionality on the one hand to psychoanalytic definitive lack on the
other. (p. 107) [The psychoanalytic definitive lack she speaks of refers
to the Lacanian configuration of desire as always attempting to recover,
to master, to instantiate an identity that is supposedly interminably
lost as soon as language acts upon the subject. This lack is inaugurated
through the subjects relation to what it cannot have, or, in Spivak's
terms, the "originary phenomenal passion" referring to the oedipal
scene, which is presumed to be the origin of desire for all. This
configuration of desire renders all subjects desiring of overcoming that
lack. But it is a particular form of desire and a particular quality of
lack. The presumption of this quality---the presumption about what and
how people desire---I argue here, must be accountable to the
politico-historical configurations which have produced it]{.underline}.
1 Spivak (1996) makes [the]{.underline} [distinction between utterance
and speech, the former being a kind of inaudible babble, and the other
being a kind of speech that can be recognized in the political space. 2
This is Spivak's (1999) particular concern with psychoanalytic
theoretical applications that recruit Freud's gender theories (p. 284).
686 Rogers Politico-historical configurations, by definition, are not
universal.]{.underline} [That is, contra Zizek (2006), I argue that not
all the world is a symptom, but that any psychoanalysis of a political
symptom, of a political subject, or of the desires examined through
psychoanalysis as they emerge in a political arena, assume a particular
formation of desire]{.underline}. And that such an analysis operates
within the parameters and employs the understandings of the oedipal
scene, or, simply of a subjectivity split by language, including the
language of law. As Lacan (2006) says "language begins along with law"
(p. 225). While this split subjectivity may appear to be universal---and
is convincingly employed as such by psychoanalytic and political
theorists, and often philosophers (Butler, 1997; Epstein, 2013; Zevnik,
2016; Zizek, 2006), this splitting refers specifically to an oedipal
lineage, as a particular instantiation of Oedipal Law, and, as I argue
positive law as a liberal law concerned with rights and with what once
can or cannot have from the polis as much as what one can take from the
father. Thus the "originary phenomenal passion," which a psychoanalysis
of the political engages, always refers back as I will explain, to a
(primal) father as a sovereign in a wrangle with his sons, a scene which
itself cannot not be understood without its resonances to the French
Revolution.

This essay is an examination of an emerging form of asymmetric warfare;
a look at the situation on the ground. Taken out of context, the
following material might appear to some as a, "terrorist operations
manual." It isn\'t. Operational information has been intentionally
excluded. I\'ve never advocated violence or breaking the law, but I know
that those facts don\'t matter under a system of overt fascism. Even so,
I\'m stating, clearly and emphatically, that what follows is intended

INTRODUCTION The germ of this essay was a Wired article about electronic
piracy called, "[The Shadow
Internet](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.01/topsite.html)."[1](http://cryptogon.com/docs/pirate_insurgency.html#sdendnote1sym)
The following Cryptogon analysis will focus on the nature of insurgency
in the U.S. and critical national security aspects of electronic piracy
that the article failed to address. The Wired article does not mention
that there is now a strong ideological motivation driving some actors in
the piracy scene. Back in the 1980s, piracy was mostly for the fun of
it, as the article indicates. Now, though, [some militant anarchists see
piracy as a way of bankrupting corporations and view their activities as
a form of warfare against corporations and the governments that serve
them]{.underline}. The supporting material for this statement is
available on the Internet. I will not provide direct links to
information related to the operational aspects of militant electronic
piracy because doing so could subject me to criminal
prosecution.[2](http://cryptogon.com/docs/pirate_insurgency.html#sdendnote2sym)
This analysis will use the term "militant electronic piracy" to refer to
the high level, massive theft and distribution of copyrighted material
for purposes of politico-economic warfare. This may be viewed in stark
contrast to the more ubiquitous activity of "file trading," where
individuals use peer-to-peer software to download music, movies and
software for free. Casual file traders ascribe no political motivation
whatsoever to their actions. "[The American Corporate State," (ACS)
refers to the existing power structure in the U.S. This system is
characterized by the fascist convergence of corporate and government
interests]{.underline}.[3](http://cryptogon.com/docs/pirate_insurgency.html#sdendnote3sym)
In order to understand the national security implications of militant
electronic piracy, an examination of conventional insurgency against the
American Corporate State is necessary. THE NATURE OF ARMED INSURGENCY
AGAINST THE ACS [Any violent insurgency against the ACS is sure to fail
and will only serve to enhance the state\'s power. The major flaw of
violent insurgencies, both cell based]{.underline} (Weathermen
Underground, Black Panthers, Aryan Nations etc.) [and
leaderless]{.underline} (Earth Liberation Front, People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals, etc.) [is that they are attempting to attack the
system using the same tactics the ACS has already mastered: terror and
psychological operations. The ACS attained primacy through the effective
application of terror and psychological operations. Therefore, it has
far more skill and experience in the use of these tactics than any
upstart could ever hope to
attain.]{.underline}[[4](http://cryptogon.com/docs/pirate_insurgency.html#sdendnote4sym)
This makes the ACS impervious to traditional insurgency
tactics]{.underline}. - Political Activism and the ACS Counterinsurgency
Apparatus The ACS employs a full time counterinsurgency infrastructure
with resources that are unimaginable to most would be insurgents. Quite
simply, violent insurgents have no idea of just how powerful the foe
actually is. Violent insurgents typically start out as peaceful,
idealistic, political activists. Whether or not political activists know
it, even with very mundane levels of political activity, they are
engaging in low intensity conflict with the ACS. [The U.S. military
classifies political activism as "low intensity conflict."]{.underline}
The scale of warfare (in terms of intensity) begins with individuals
distributing anti-government handbills and public gatherings with
anti-government/anti-corporate themes. In the middle of the conflict
intensity scale are what the military refers to as Operations Other than
War; an example would be the situation the U.S. is facing in Iraq. At
the upper right hand side of the graph is global thermonuclear war. What
is important to remember is that the military is concerned with ALL
points along this scale because they represent different types of
threats to the ACS. Making distinctions between civilian law enforcement
and military forces, and foreign and domestic intelligence services is
no longer necessary. After September 11, 2001, all national security
assets would be brought to bare against any U.S. insurgency movement.
Additionally, the U.S. military established NORTHCOM which designated
the U.S. as an active military operational area. [Crimes involving the
loss of corporate profits will increasingly be treated as acts of
terrorism and could garner anything from a local law enforcement
response to activation of regular military forces. Most of what is
commonly referred to as "political activism" is viewed by the corporate
state\'s counterinsurgency apparatus as a useful and necessary component
of political control.]{.underline} Letters-to-the-editor\...
Calls-to-elected-representatives\... Waving banners\... "Third" party
political activities\... Taking beatings, rubber bullets and tear gas
from riot police in free speech zones\... [Political activism amounts to
an utterly useless waste of time, in terms of tangible power, which is
all the ACS understands. Political activism is a cruel guise that is
sold to people who are dissatisfied, but who have no concept of the
nature of tangible power. Counterinsurgency teams routinely monitor
these activities, attend the meetings, join the groups and take on
leadership roles in the organizations. It\'s only a matter of time
before some individuals determine that political activism is a honeypot
that accomplishes nothing and wastes their time. The corporate state
knows that some small percentage of the peaceful, idealistic, political
activists will eventually figure out the game]{.underline}. At this
point, the clued-in activists will probably do one of two things; drop
out or move to escalate the struggle in other ways. If the clued-in
activist drops his or her political activities, the ACS wins[. But what
if the clued-in activist refuses to give up the struggle? Feeling
powerless, desperation could set in and these individuals might become
increasingly radicalized. Because the corporate state\'s
counterinsurgency operatives have infiltrated most political activism
groups, the radicalized members will be easily identified, monitored and
eventually compromised/turned, arrested or executed. The ACS wins
again.]{.underline} - ACS Full-Spectrum PSYOP Dominance [The ACS wields
the most powerful weapon of political control the world has ever seen:
the mass media. This is the corporate state\'s trump card against
leaderless resistance movements which are impossible to infiltrate and
compromise by counter-insurgency teams. The appearance of legitimacy is
all that matters in a low intensity conflict, and the ACS, with the
corporate media running continuous propaganda and perception management
campaigns, represents the final solution to what the public will view as
legitimate.]{.underline}[[5](http://cryptogon.com/docs/pirate_insurgency.html#sdendnote5sym)
All anti-corporate/anti-government political activism will be portrayed
by the ACS as lunatic muckraking and a potential hotbed of terrorism.
All violent insurgency activities will be portrayed as terrorist
acts.]{.underline} (Some criminal activity is now considered terrorism
by the ACS.) The behavior of the ACS will be represented as just,
measured and prudent, regardless of the ghastly nature of its
atrocities. The general population will be bombarded with images, sound
bites and articles about the threats posed by the "terrorists." [In
other words, the population, rather then fearing the state and its
continuous cryptofascist operations and more overt international war
crimes and economic exploitation, will come to view the insurgents as a
threat and the ACS as their savior. The ACS can punctuate the point by
unleashing false flag terror incidents on the population while
conveniently blaming any organization it wishes, including other
states]{.underline}.[6](http://cryptogon.com/docs/pirate_insurgency.html#sdendnote6sym)
The general population will respond by supporting: foreign wars, the
diminution of individual rights, and legislation and funding that adds
to the power of the corporate state. Some simple analogies might help to
clarify the realities facing an armed insurgency in the United States.
Could a 5 year old beat a university mathematics professor in a
mathematics contest? Could an ape beat a grand champion at chess? Could
a high school basketball team beat the Los Angeles Lakers at basketball?
[Could an armed insurgency overthrow the American Corporate State? The
obvious answer to all of these questions is: NO.]{.underline} Some
insurgents, having determined that terror and psyops will obviously fail
against the ACS, sought out other means of attacking this extremely
powerful foe. MILITANT ELECTRONIC PIRACY: MILITARY-STYLE DAMAGE WITH
NON-VIOLENT TACTICS High level electronic piracy (massive intellectual
property theft and distribution) has the potential to inflict
\"military-style\" damage to the American Corporate State. What does
military-style damage mean in this context? - Bankrupt ACS The ACS is
quite literally bankrupt, yet it continues to function do to an
increasing flow of foreign capital that serves to finance its
unimaginable levels of
debt.[7](http://cryptogon.com/docs/pirate_insurgency.html#sdendnote7sym)
If an insurgency was able to slow the flow of capital to corporations,
by any means, the revenue loss could eventually cause reverberations
throughout the economy that would be catastrophic for the ACS and the
wider system of institutionalized theft commonly referred to as "global
capitalism." According to Robert Holleyman, president and CEO of the
Business Software Alliance, "Software piracy continues to be a major
challenge for economies worldwide. From Algeria to New Zealand, Canada
to China, piracy deprives local governments of tax revenue, costs jobs
throughout the technology supply chain and cripples the local,
in-country software
industry."[8](http://cryptogon.com/docs/pirate_insurgency.html#sdendnote8sym)
If any non-violent insurgency could cause serious and sustained economic
damage to major components of the ACS, the resulting chaos might
resemble the results of a strategic military attack, complete with
infrastructure breakdown, food shortages and the collapse of government
authority. This is not to say that militant electronic piracy would be
the primary cause of the collapse of the ACS. Piracy might, however,
serve as the straw, or one of several straws, the breaks the camel\'s
back. - Casual Downloaders Unknowingly Assist Insurgency In the most
simple terms, the less money individuals spend, the faster the collapse
of the ACS will occur. The ubiquity of peer-to-peer file trading tools
provides non-technical computer users point-and-click access to massive
amounts of music, movies and software. The militant electronic pirates
are intelligent. They know most people are lazy and will
never\-\--willingly\-\--do anything to fight the status quo, in terms of
tangible power. Do casual downloaders think they are throwing Molotov
cocktails at a TimeWarner building or blowing up a Walmart each time
they download music or movies from the Internet for free? No, the
average p2p user isn\'t thinking along these lines. But every legitimate
purchase that isn\'t made as a result of electronic piracy drives
another nail into the coffin of the American Corporate State. At what
point does electronic piracy move from being an annoyance for profit
hungry corporations to a national security matter? - Militant Electronic
Piracy Operations Militant electronic piracy operations may be carried
out by anti-corporate computer experts in any geographic location on the
planet. Whereas armed insurgents face physical and public relations
impossibilities of using political violence successfully, militant
electronic pirates, on the other hand, can more effectively control the
battle space using security hardened software tools (all of which are
available for free). On the Internet, militant electronic pirates
possess capabilities that are more congruent to the corporate state than
the most sophisticated armed insurgency group could ever hope to attain
in the conventional military sphere. By using electronic piracy as a
mode of attack, pirates are able to inflict tens of billions of dollars
worth of damages per year against the
ACS.[9](http://cryptogon.com/docs/pirate_insurgency.html#sdendnote9sym)
This is an astonishing proof of the validity of this mode of attack
versus violent operations. Violent insurgency groups, such as the Earth
Liberation Front, have only managed to inflict tens of million dollars
worth of damage to the ACS over their entire lifetimes. Additionally,
pirates do tangible damage to the ACS with little to fear in the way of
a public relations backlash. The ACS has had difficulty in generating
public concern for the losses of maniacal corporations, primarily
because no unpleasant spin\-\--such as news video of anti-corporate
rioting and chaos\-\--is possible. Militant electronic piracy represents
a silent, continuous and costly attack on the ACS. Contrast this to
violent insurgency tactics, which amount only to symbolic pinpricks
against the ACS and are accompanied by wholly untenable public relations
consequences. Militant electronic pirates enjoy the benefits of being
able to conduct their operations in a virtual battlefield. Stealth is
obtainable through the use of encryption and other techniques that are
not suitable for discussion in an essay of this type. As a result,
authorities face great difficulty in trying to interdict high level
pirates. According to a recent Associated Press article: The groups are
typically very hierarchical, with tiers of leadership, said John
Malcolm, head of the Motion Picture Association of America\'s antipiracy
unit. \"There are many of them out there, highly organized, very
clandestine,\" Malcolm said. \"They\'re tough nuts to crack.\"
Authorities don\'t have a fix on how many groups exist. \"There are a
lot of similarities with the drug war,\" said David Israelite, chairman
of the U.S. Justice Department\'s Intellectual Property Task Force.
\"You never really are going to eliminate the problem, but what you hope
to do is stop its
growth.\"[10](http://cryptogon.com/docs/pirate_insurgency.html#sdendnote10sym)
With the continuous increase in the use of broadband Internet
connections, the base of the piracy pyramid\-\--the casual
downloaders\-\--will only continue to grow in size. New peer-to-peer
filetrading tools and specialized firewalls (all available for free)
increasingly protect users at the base of the pyramid from ACS
interdiction efforts. A small number of insurgent seed nodes can, in a
very short period of time, spread files further down toward the ever
expanding (and well defended) base of the pyramid, causing an
unstoppable flood of shared files. It\'s not clear which task would be
more daunting for the ACS: attempting to apprehend tens of millions of
individual downloaders, or attempting to take down a loose network of
several thousand hard-core, militant pirates with computer skills that
are commensurate with intelligence agency information warfare experts. -
Just Kids Having Fun? The assertion in some media (the Wired article,
for example) that high level electronic piracy is
just-a-bunch-of-kids-out-for-a-good-time is ludicrous. Without a doubt,
at the lower levels, a horde of generally clueless users is just looking
for free music, movies and software. But at the node level and above,
things are much more interesting. It\'s difficult to imagine individuals
taking on different multi-billion dollar industries (represented by
RIAA-Music, MPAA-Movies, BSA-Software), the mercenaries hired by these
industries (Overpeer, etc.) and the U.S. Government just for the fun of
it. The ACS is dedicating increasing energy to thwarting high level
electronic piracy. The U.S. Department of Justice agent above compared
electronic piracy to the drug war! Clearly, it\'s not all fun and games
for high level electronic pirates. It\'s war. THE ACS RESPONSE [The ACS
will become increasingly reckless as it nears the abyss of economic
collapse. It will lash out against enemies, real and perceived, in
expected and unexpected ways. As for the pirates, they\'re already
classified as
terrorists.]{.underline}[[11](http://cryptogon.com/docs/pirate_insurgency.html#sdendnote11sym)
They should expect the ACS to escalate the operations against them.
Expect a legislated, "national security" justification for Microsoft\'s
long awaited (and dreaded) Digital Rights Management scheme, codenamed
Longhorn]{.underline}. Microsoft will tout Longhorn as the solution to
piracy and other "terrorist" uses of computers and the Internet. Besides
turning each computer into a tamper proof vending machine (this will
mean The End of general purpose computing), Longhorn will provide an
astonishing surveillance capability to ACS law enforcement, intelligence
and military organizations. Those who refuse to use Longhorn will
increasingly find themselves locked out of networks. [The goal will be
to apply maximum surveillance and control to "trusted" users on the
Internet. CONCLUSION Militant electronic pirates can successfully obtain
military-style results from their
activities.]{.underline}[[12](http://cryptogon.com/docs/pirate_insurgency.html#sdendnote12sym)
An insurgency based on militant electronic piracy is viable (and
preferable to violent tactics) for several reasons. Militant electronic
pirates cause orders of magnitude greater damage to the ACS than violent
insurgencies. And they do so while avoiding much of the
impossible-to-manage public relations disaster that surrounds violent
tactics]{.underline}. Pirates use a virtual battlespace for most of
their activities; they can attack and maneuver without too much fear of
being physically apprehended by authorities. Militant electronic piracy
takes advantage of the massive force multiplication effect of tens of
millions of low level cadres (casual downloaders) who don\'t even
understand the implications of what they\'re doing. [With a foe as
powerful as the ACS, violent insurgents face an impossible struggle.
Militant electronic piracy offers a much more viable and effective mode
of combat to insurgents, both as groups and as individuals]{.underline}.

### 2AC -- Decolonizing debate fails

#### Decolonizing debate fails -- it obscures the materiality of settler colonialism

**Tuck and Yang 12** \[Eve is an award winning scholar in field of
Indigenous studies and educational research \["Decolonization is not a
metaphor" pg 1-40\]//Mberhe

Our goal in this article is to remind readers what is unsettling about
decolonization. **[Decolonization brings about the repatriation of
Indigenous land and life; it is not a metaphor for other things we want
to do to improve our societies and schools]{.underline}**. The [easy
adoption of decolonizing discourse by educational advocacy and
scholarship, evidenced by the increasing number of calls to "decolonize
our schools," or use "decolonizing methods," or, "decolonize student
thinking", turns decolonization into a metaphor.]{.underline} As
important as their goals may be, social justice, critical methodologies,
or approaches that decenter settler perspectives have objectives that
may be incommensurable with decolonization. **[Because settler
colonialism is built upon an entangled triad structure of
settler-native-slave, the decolonial desires of white, nonwhite,
immigrant, postcolonial, and oppressed people, can similarly be
entangled in resettlement, reoccupation, and reinhabitation that
actually further settler colonialism. The metaphorization of
decolonization makes possible a set of evasions, or "settler moves to
innocence", that problematically attempt to reconcile settler guilt and
complicity, and rescue settler futurity. In]{.underline}** this article,
we analyze multiple settler moves towards innocence in order to forward
"an ethic of incommensurability" that recognizes what is distinct and
what is sovereign for project(s) of decolonization in relation to human
and civil rights based social justice projects. We also point to
unsettling themes within transnational/Third World decolonizations,
abolition, and critical spaceplace pedagogies, which challenge the
coalescence of social justice endeavors, making room for more meaningful
potential alliances.

### 2AC -- Entrapment DA

#### Entrapment DA -- resisting the state gets infiltrated and shutdown by provocateurs --federal violence against marginalized groups increases and takes out solvency

**Schepers 17** (Emily Schepers, veteran civil and immigrant rights
activist, doctorate in cultural anthropology from Northwestern
University, September 18, 2017. "Agents provocateurs and the
manipulation of the radical left."
<https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/agents-provocateurs-and-the-manipulation-of-the-radical-left/>)

[The far-right surge arising in the wake of the election of Donald Trump
includes various shades of fascism]{.underline}. This is being abetted
by the president and other major political leaders. [It has led to a
many-fronted crisis to which we need to prioritize effective resistance.
To be effective such resistance must do two things.]{.underline} First,
it must aim to protect [the sections of our society which are being
targeted by the right-wing surge. African Americans, other minorities,
immigrants, women, LGBTQ people, the poor, and the natural environment
are all in the crosshairs of the right]{.underline}. Total solidarity of
all with all is essential. Second, [effective resistance has to turn the
politics of the situation around so that there is a truly massive,
society-wide rejection of fascism and the right in the country, in the
elections, in the legislative field, on the cultural front, and in every
other possible arena.]{.underline} The 2017 and 2018 elections are thus
tremendously important. Right now, there is considerable discussion
going on about the best way to do all these things. Tactics that make us
feel good because they are exhilarating are not necessarily the same as
effective tactics. They can, in fact, be precisely the opposite.
[History teaches us is that the ruling class, the state and non-state
institutions it controls, as well as the right have learned the
political judo whereby the left's actions may be turned around and used
to strengthen the right and weaken the left]{.underline}. Specifically,
we should learn from the history of the agent provocateur, a specialist
in manipulating conflict so as to benefit our enemies. [Agents
provocateurs are not merely enemy spies within the people's movement.
The provocateur has an even more sinister mission, which sometimes has
deadly results. What the provocateur frequently provokes is actions that
either discredit the left or the people's movement in the eyes of large
numbers of people, or which entrap the unwary into acts that will allow
police to pounce, accuse activists of plotting violent or other
anti-social acts, and then lock them up. Agents provocateurs have been
known for well over a century, in many countries;]{.underline} the breed
was especially rife in tsarist Russia in the late 1800s and early 1900s.
[In the United States, agents provocateurs often targeted labor union
organizing efforts. Since the end of the Second World War and the
beginning of the Cold War, there are many accounts of the FBI, other
police bodies, the military, and private right-wing vigilante groups
sending agents provocateurs into people's organizations with the purpose
of dividing, disrupting, and discrediting them and then laying them open
to arrest and prosecution, or worse]{.underline}. More radical than thou
In the 1960s and 1970s, there was a great outpouring of grassroots
rejection of the policies, domestic and international, of the Cold War.
The Civil Rights Movement, plus the movement against the Vietnam War,
brought millions into the streets protesting courageously against the
many injustices of our society. The Cold Warriors and the ruling class
did not like this, as they saw their interests threatened. So they
developed [open and covert strategies for undermining the new radicalism
as well as the "old left" (communists and socialists). The idea was to
make sure that the left did not continue to win over the support of the
mass of the people of the United States to progressive and ultimately,
revolutionary, socialist ideas]{.underline}. The "new left" tendencies
that arose at this time included many positive features but had some
dangerous flaws also. One flaw was that too often, a fetish was made of
the absolute right of anybody involved in an organization to express his
or her opinion no matter how divergent from the main goals of the
organization, or to engage in any activity which was "radical"
regardless of whether it helped or harmed the cause. [This extreme
liberalism laid many organizations open to manipulation of some of their
weakest elements by agents provocateurs. There was also a tendency to
compete to see who was most radical. The competition for revolutionary
"cred" was a godsend for agents provocateurs, who actively encouraged
such competition. The lack of connections, especially among campus-based
white radicals, to the working class and its politics exacerbated this
trend by eliminating an important reality check.]{.underline} Picking
off leaders and undermining public support There also tended to be a
cult of leadership within many radical organizations which put their
leaders into a vulnerable position in which they could be targeted for
neutralization so as to undermine the whole movement. J. Edgar Hoover's
FBI, for instance, put a huge amount of effort into neutralizing
leaders. The agents provocateurs were deployed in such a way as to
discredit the leaders and their organizations, to create splits in the
movement, and in some cases to provoke violence which would lead to
physical elimination of leaders plus a societal repudiation of the
movement. The 1960s campus-based movement against the Vietnam War was a
top target for agents provocateurs. There were several at work, but one,
known as "[Tommy the
Traveler](https://jeffsharletandvietnamgi.blogspot.com/2011/04/tommy-traveler.html)"
was particularly memorable. He, too, concentrated on enticing
impressionable young would-be "revolutionaries" to commit acts that
would divide the movement while landing them in jail. Hoover, a
crusading anti-communist and paranoid racist, paid particular attention
to disrupting the
[highly-effective](https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/want-to-punch-a-nazi-think-twice/)
African American people's movement, often employing agents provocateurs
to create friction within and between liberation organizations. This led
to several murders. In 1967, for example, agents provocateurs,
especially a certain [William
O'Neal](https://www.thenation.com/article/was-fred-hampton-executed/),
described in a Nation article as "infatuated with weapons," played a
role in the police murder of Illinois Black Panther Party leaders Fred
Hampton and Mark Clark. Hampton had been suspicious of O'Neal because of
his violent talk, but others did not see through him, with tragic
results. O'Neal's promotion of crackpot violent schemes should have been
a giveaway. When O'Neal set up Hampton and Clark for a brutal murder by
police acting under the orders of Cook County State's Attorney Ed
Hanrahan, the perpetrators were able to convince sectors of the public
that the Panthers were prone to violence and shot first, which was
untrue. Another example was the crime of Cerro Maravilla, in Puerto
Rico, on July 25, 1978. An agent provocateur, [Alejandro González
Malavé](https://nacla.org/article/cerro-maravilla-deaths-police-cover-rock-puerto-rico),
working undercover for the Puerto Rican police, enticed two idealistic
young supporters of independence for Puerto Rico into a reckless act
that cost them their lives. One was Carlos Enrique Soto Areví, the son
of one of Puerto Rico's most important literary figures, the novelist
Pedro Juan Soto. The second was a self-taught worker, Arnaldo Dario
Rosado. Both were on fire with indignation at the colonialist treatment
that Puerto Rico received at the hands of the United States (treatment
which continues today). They wanted to demonstrate this indignation in
some dramatic way. Their lack of practical political experience made
them easy prey for González Malavé. He persuaded them that a noble act
for their homeland would be to destroy some communications towers on the
top of a hill called "Cerro Maravilla." This was supposed to express
solidarity with some imprisoned Puerto Rican independence fighters. The
three kidnapped a taxi driver and forced him to drive them up to Cerro
Maravilla. But when they arrived, they found they had been led into a
police ambush. As the armed police approached, González Malavé
identified himself as an agent, but Soto and Rosado were killed, and the
"official" story was put out that they had been shot in a firefight with
the cops. The right-wing, pro-statehood governor at the time, Carlos
Romero Barceló, hailed the police as heroes, and the FBI helpfully
pitched in to support the Puerto Rican Justice Department with the
cover-up. However, the police had left a "loose end," namely the taxi
driver, who spoke to the press and revealed that in fact González Malavé
was a police agent and that the two young men were still alive when he
left the place. The police had entrapped the two men, then murdered them
after they surrendered. This became a big scandal, and eventually led to
prosecutions and the defeat of Romero Barceló's party in the next
elections. But the use of agents provocateurs to divide and isolate the
Puerto Rican left has been unrelenting, both before and after that
incident. Disrupting today's movements Such agent provocateur tactics
surfaced again during the protests against the Iraq War, and in the
"Occupy" movement. In each case, glib charismatic strangers wormed their
way into protest organizations, and then entrapped inexperienced young
radicals to get involved in plans, which were sometimes really just
talk, to engage in violence. A typical case is that of the "[Cleveland
bomb
plot](http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/02/nation/la-na-nn-fbi-stings-20120502)"
of 2012. Another is the San Francisco [Mission District
riot](https://missionlocal.org/2012/05/occupysf-reacts-to-monday-nights-destruction-of-valencia/)
of May 2012, when a mysterious black-clad contingent hijacked part of a
peaceful "Occupy" demonstration and turned it toward random violence. In
both cases, the purpose of the provocateurs was to discredit the
movement in the eyes of the public, which otherwise might have been
receptive to Occupy's "99 percent versus one percent" message. This kind
of manipulation still continues by all accounts. As before[, the purpose
is to discredit the movement, divide it, deprive it of allies, and set
up leaders and organizations for repressive action while making sure
that this repression will not produce a wave of public indignation, as
happened with the Cerro Maravilla case. The right and the ruling class
always try to portray these people's movements as violent, because this
is the alchemy best suited to turn public opinion against them. This is
the main lesson to be learned from the agent provocateur experiences of
the past. In the conditions of our country today, injecting violent
tactics into the mass movement of protest undermines that movement and
plays the enemy's game. Loose talk about violence can be just as
dangerous. This danger is multiplied by the development of online
communications and social media---there are no secrets now. Hijacking
other people's protest actions to "move them to a higher level," meaning
toward violent confrontations, is really a dirty kind of pseudo-left
politics.]{.underline} What is needed now is to build the movement into
a great wave of rejection against the reactionary policies of the ruling
class, the right, and the Trump administration and its allies. Let us
work on that basis and avoid tactics that undermine it.

### 2AC -- Fiat DA

#### The alternatives use of fiat to understand decol turns it into an empty signifier 

**Tuck and Yang 12** \[Eve is an award winning scholar in field of
Indigenous studies and educational research \["Decolonization is not a
metaphor" pg 1-40\]//Mberhe

Decolonization in exploitative colonial situations could involve the
seizing of imperial wealth by the postcolonial subject. In settler
colonial situations, seizing imperial wealth is inextricably tied to
settlement and re-invasion. Likewise, the promise of integration and
civil rights is predicated on securing a share of a settler-appropriated
wealth (as well as expropriated 'third-world' wealth). [Decolonization
in a settler context is fraught because empire, settlement, and internal
colony have no spatial separation]{.underline}. Each of these features
of settler colonialism in the US context - empire, settlement, and
internal colony - make it a site of contradictory decolonial desires7 .
**[Decolonization as metaphor allows people to equivocate these
contradictory decolonial desires because it turns decolonization into an
empty signifier to be filled by any track towards liberation. In
reality, the tracks walk all over land/people in settler contexts.
T]{.underline}**hough the details are not fixed or agreed upon, in our
view, decolonization in the settler colonial context must involve the
repatriation of land simultaneous to the recognition of how land and
relations to land have always already been differently understood and
enacted; that is, all of the land, and not just symbolically. This is
precisely why [decolonization is necessarily unsettling, especially
across lines of solidarity. "Decolonization never takes place
unnoticed"]{.underline} (Fanon, 1963, p. 36). [Settler colonialism and
its decolonization implicates and unsettles everyone.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Food security

#### There has been successful food reform that has provided material instances of ensuring the right to food -- policy is key to address food inequalities. 

**FAO Right to Food Team 09---**Food and Agriculture Organization the
United Nations (2009, "The Right to Food",
<http://www.fao.org/right-to-food/resources/resources-detail/en/c/49285/>
//RC)

[Indigenous peoples, like everyone else, have a right to adequate food
and a fundamental right to be free from hunger.]{.underline} This is
stipulated in Article 11 of the *International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights* (ICEsCR) of 1966 and constitutes binding
international law. [This means states Parties to the ICEsCR are obliged
to implement the right to food domestically, ensuring that it becomes
part of their national legal system. The right to food entitles every
person to an economic, political, and social environment that will allow
them to achieve food security in dignity through their own means.
Individuals or groups who do not have the capacity to meet their food
needs for reasons beyond their control, such as illness, discrimination,
age, unemployment, economic downturn, or natural disaster, are entitled
to be provided with food directly.]{.underline} The obligation to ensure
a minimum level necessary to be free from hunger is one of immediate
effect. [Various other binding and non-binding international legal
instruments protect indigenous peoples' right to food, directly or
indirectly. The *UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
Peoples*2]{.underline}, adopted in September 2007, [is a comprehensive
statement addressing the human rights of indigenous peoples. It
emphasizes the rights of indigenous peoples to live in dignity, to
maintain and strengthen their own institutions, cultures and traditions
and to pursue their self-determined development, in keeping with their
own needs and aspirations.]{.underline} The [Declaration contains
provisions on land, natural resources and subsistence activities, which
are highly relevant for the realization of the right to food, recognizes
indigenous peoples' collective rights and stresses cultural
rights.]{.underline} **[The *Voluntary Guidelines to Support the
Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of
National Food Security (Right to Food Guidelines)* provide policy
orientation in a number of areas and can be used by indigenous peoples
as a tool for advocacy.]{.underline}** They refer to indigenous
communities in the context of access to resources and assets. In
addition, provisions relating to vulnerable groups and disaggregation of
data, among others (3.3 on strategies; 7.2 on legal framework; 8.2 and
8.3 on access to resources and assets; 12.3 on national financial
resources; 13 on support for vulnerable groups; 14.4 on safety nets;
15.1 on international food aid; 17.2 and 17.5 on monitoring, indicators
and benchmarks) are of particular relevance to indigenous peoples[. The
UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples states that
indigenous peoples have the right to fully enjoy as a collective or as
individuals, all human rights and fundamental freedoms.]{.underline}
[With particular regard to the right to food, indigenous representatives
on the occasion of the 2002 Global Consultation signed the Declaration
of Atitlán3, stating that they were: "\... in agreement that the content
of the right to food of indigenous peoples is a collective
right".]{.underline} The adoption of the [*UN Declaration on the Rights
of Indigenous Peoples* brought the universal recognition of the right to
food as a **collective right one step forward**.]{.underline} This is
already reflected in the preamble of the Declaration which states that
"\... Indigenous Peoples possess collective rights which are
indispensable for their existence, well-being and integral development
as peoples." The right to food is one such indispensable right.
[Indigenous peoples' right to food has a particular cultural dimension
which is relevant in terms of food choices, food preparation and
acquisition. Culturally appropriate foods and the activities to obtain
them, such as agriculture, hunting and fishing, form an important part
of cultural identity]{.underline}.4 Furthermore, cultural acceptability
of food is an element of the normative content of the right to food, and
is of particular relevance to indigenous peoples. Right to Food
Guideline 10.10 on nutrition highlights the cultural aspects of
nutrition and pertains to indigenous peoples in particular. It
translates this principle into a practical policy recommendation by
reminding states "\...of the cultural values of dietary and eating
habits in different cultures\..." The right to food may be violated in
case of denial of access to land, fishing or hunting grounds,
deprivation of access to adequate and culturally acceptable food and
contamination of food sources. some court cases, in which indigenous
peoples have been involved, have already illustrated and proven that the
right to food provides indigenous peoples with an additional legal
argument when claiming their rights or challenging decisions or
omissions before administrative authorities or courts. Indeed, states
have particular obligations concerning the right to food of indigenous
peoples. These include respecting indigenous peoples' traditional ways
of living, strengthening traditional food systems and protecting
subsistence activities such as hunting, fishing and gathering. The
respect, protection and fulfilment of the right to food as a collective
right has an additional value in comparison to individual rights. This
additional value is related to the fact that some property rights to
lands, territories and resources are held collectively, and subsistence
based activities carried out collectively are not only part of
indigenous peoples' cultural identity, but are often essential for their
very existence. The right to food, in its collective dimension, is
clearly supplementary to the individual one. Under the right to food,
states are also responsible for ensuring the application of general
human rights principles to indigenous peoples, both in their food and
nutrition security policies and other policies that may affect their
access to food. The right to food does not only address the final
outcome of eliminating hunger and ensuring food security but provides a
holistic tool and approach for indigenous peoples to improve their food
security situation. The rights-based approach, normatively based on
international human rights standards, determines in the food security
context the relationship between indigenous groups and individuals as
rights holders and the state with correlative obligations as a duty
bearer. These human rights principles include participation,
accountability, non-discrimination, transparency, human dignity,
empowerment and the rule of law. A rights-based approach requires
particular attention to indigenous peoples' specific circumstances and
concerns. Applied to the right to food in practice, this means that
indigenous peoples must be engaged and particularly supported in
processes that determine food security and related policies, legislation
and decisions. states should provide space for participation in the
setting of verifiable targets and benchmarks for subsequent monitoring
and accountability of food security. With regards to non-discrimination,
governments should also ensure that data is disaggregated by age, sex
and ethnicity. This information should then be used for the development,
design, implementation and monitoring of more appropriate food and
nutrition policies, which address the needs of all groups, including
indigenous peoples. The concepts of the right to food and food
sovereignty are related. The clarification of their content is
particularly necessary in the context of indigenous peoples because
these terms are often mentioned together and interchangeably in
different statements and documents.6 The right to food is a legal
concept a human right and in the case of its violation, remedies can be
claimed where available. Food sovereignty is a political concept; there
is no existing international human right corresponding to the right to
food sovereignty. However, the two concepts have some common elements,
and food sovereignty includes calls for the realization of the right to
food. The claim of food sovereignty campaigners is for emphasis on local
and national production and the right of peoples to freely define their
own food and agricultural policies. [One illustrative case for the
significance of the right to food for empowerment, advocacy and
litigation is a decision by the African Commission on Human and Peoples'
Rights regarding a complaint brought by *SERAC and CESR against
Nigeria*.]{.underline}5 The complaint alleged the military Government of
Nigeria of violating human rights of the Ogoni people. The Nigerian
National Petroleum Company (NNPC), the state oil company, formed a joint
venture with shell Petroleum Development Corporation (sPDC) whose
activities in the Ogoni region allegedly caused environmental
degradation, health problems among the Ogoni people and a destruction of
food sources, resulting from the contamination of soil, water and air[.
In its decision, the African Commission found several violations of the
African Charter, including a violation of the right to food, which is
implicit in the right to life, the right to health and the right to
economic, social and cultural development. The African Commission argued
that the minimum core of the right to food requires the Nigerian
Government to not destroy or contaminate food sources. Furthermore, it
found that **the Government has a duty to protect its citizens**, not
only through appropriate legislation and effective enforcement but also
by protecting them from damaging acts that may be perpetrated by private
parties and by preventing peoples' efforts to feed
themselves.]{.underline} Food sovereignty and the right to food are
often complementary. [For example, the right to food as a human right
implies the application of the participatory approach to food security
on the basis of the human rights principle of participation. This
signifies that participating population groups and individuals,
including indigenous peoples, can shape strategies, policies and
programmed promoting the realization of right to food.]{.underline} Thus
right to food mechanisms can be used for the promotion of food
sovereignty claims when this contributes to regular, permanent and
unrestricted access to quantitatively and qualitatively adequate and
sufficient food. The right to food has both a cultural and a
sustainability dimension. While it can be argued that local production
is more sustainable, the right to food does not. [The process of
clarifying the **implications of the right of indigenous peoples to
adequate food has just started**. Laws and policies]{.underline} need to
be [put into practice to ensure that indigenous peoples fully enjoy the
right to food.]{.underline} Indigenous peoples must assert their human
rights, including the right to food and exert pressure on states and
their officials to meet human rights obligations and commitments.
[states on the other hand are required to respect and protect indigenous
peoples' unique cultural identities and special concerns when realizing
their right to food. Increased awareness and capacity of both rights
holders and duty bearers is necessary for rights to be
realized.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Futurity Good

#### A focused mindset centered on futurity supports marginalized groups- indigenous resistance movements proves 

**Kuttner, 17**---Education Partnership Manager & Director for Community
Engaged Scholarship, University Neighborhood Partners, University of
Utah (Paul, "Futurism, Futurity, and the Importance of the Existential
Imagination," <http://culturalorganizing.org/futurism-futurity/>,
Accessed 7-4-2019//SR)

In arts and social change work, we talk about the importance of being
able to imagine a future that is better --- more just --- than the world
we live in today. [But often the struggle is a more existential one:
imagining a future where one's community or culture exists at
all.]{.underline} Last year I had the great pleasure of hearing a talk
by artist and interactive designer [Ayodamola Tanimowo
Okunseinde](http://www.ayo.io/) (Ayo). "Blackness," he told the gathered
crowd at the URBAN conference in New York City, "is being removed from
the future." [This removal, he explained, is partly physical: black
bodies are being violently removed from the future through police
killings, mass incarceration, and other systems of racial oppression.
This removal is also representational. Black people are either
misrepresented or completely unrepresented in popular visions of the
future. Mainstream science fiction, on the page and on the screen, is
[dominated by white authors and their white
characters](https://www.wired.com/2016/02/geeks-guide-diversity-destroy-scifi/)]{.underline}.
This lack of representation of People of Color is not only a question of
equity. What happens when people spend their lives being fed visions of
the future that don't include them? What does that do to their
self-perceptions? To their their ability to plan for the future? What
does it do to our collective capacity to imagine --- and enact ---
something different? In response, Ayo has transformed himself into an
[Afronaut.](http://afronaut.ayo.io/abstract.html) He walks the streets
of New York as Dr. Tanimowo, a time traveler from a future where African
diasporic peoples and cultures are well represented. His outfit --- part
space suit, part [Yoruba
masquerade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egungun) --- blends space-age
materials with West African-patterned fabrics. As he journeys through
our present time, Dr. Tanimowo interacts with passers-by. [For a moment,
they are presented with an alternative and potentially liberating vision
of the future. As Ayo explains, these travels are "a ritualistic rite,
or a ritual that's actually creating the future itself."1 The Afronaut
on expedition. Image copyright Ayodamola Okunseinde Ayo is also
encouraging others to imagine Black futures. With fellow artist [Salome
Osega](http://www.salome.zone/), Ayo runs workshops where community
members can become futuristic archeologists]{.underline}. Participants
"uncover" artifacts from the future through design, and many of those
designs are then built, here in the present. Ayo and Osega co-founded
the [Iyapo Repository](https://iyaporepository.tumblr.com/) to hold and
display these artifacts: pills that teach African American history, a
wetsuit that helps alleviate the cultural trauma of the Atlantic Slave
Trade, a necklace that senses "bad vibes" by warning the user when they
are in a location where there has been a police shooting. Ayo's
interactive design work is rooted in, among other things, Afrofuturism.
Coined in the early 90's, the term Afrofuturism was an attempt to
delineate a particular tradition of African American futuristic and
technological imagination --- a tradition embodied in the speculative
fiction of [Octavia Butler](http://octaviabutler.org/) and [Samuel
Delaney](http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/samuel-delany-and-the-past-and-future-of-science-fiction),
the music of [Sun Ra](http://www.sunraarkestra.com/1-main.html) and
[P-Funk](http://georgeclinton.com/), and the visual art of
[Basquiat](http://basquiat.com/) and
[Rammellzee](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/arts/02rammellzee.html),
among others.2 The concept was further developed by a group of writers
and critics on Alondra Nelson's Afrofuturism listserv, and came to
encompass a much larger arena of cultural production. In the words of
Nelson, [Afrofuturism is "a critical perspective that opens up inquiry
into the many overlaps between technoculture and black diasporic
histories. AfroFuturism looks across popular culture...to find models of
expression that transform spaces of alienation into novel forms of
creative potential. In the process it reclaims theorizing about the
future." 3 Afrofuturist aesthetics seem to have made a resurgence in
recent years through the work of popular artists like]{.underline}
[[Beyoncé]{.underline}](https://robobeyonce.wordpress.com/2015/03/30/beyonce-the-queen-of-afrofuturism/)
[and [Janelle
Monáe](http://www.popmatters.com/column/176055-power-up-janelle-monae-afrofuturism-and-plurality/).
Meanwhile, Afrofuturism has helped to inspire other art and scholarship,
like the [Indigenous Futurism of Wendy
Redstar](http://gutsmagazine.ca/visual-cultures/) and the
[Chican@futurism of Marion C. Martinez](http://www.marionmartinez.com/).
These and other artists are directly challenging popular discourses that
associate progress, technology, innovation, and the future itself with
whiteness. Unlike other
"[futurist](http://www.theartstory.org/movement-futurism.htm)"
movements, Afrofuturism and its cousins are neither a break with the
past nor a fetishization of the new. They are deeply rooted in history.
They offer what Nelson calls "past-future visions."]{.underline} Like
Ayo's high tech space suit, with its traditional West African elements,
these visions "insist [that who we've been and where we've traveled is
always an integral component of who we can become."4 They forefront
continuity rather than rupture, overlaying past, present, and future. As
the [Afrofuturist Affair
writes](http://www.afrofuturistaffair.com/about-afrofuturist-affair),
this kind of time-bending is not new to Communities of Color. "Whether
you call it mythology, ghost stories, cosmology, parable, folktale,
sci-fi, religious tale, or fantasy, people of color have always
contemplated their origins in the same breath that they anticipated the
fate of humankind."5 Organizers and activists also seem to be taking an
increased interest in the future. In 2015, the Movement for Black Lives
and Huffington Post launched an annual celebration of [Black Futures
Month](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/opal-tometi/black-future-month-examin_b_6589244.html),
a remixing of Black History Month that calls on people to "seize the
opportunity to change the course of history by shaping our
future."]{.underline} That same year, AK press put out [Octavia's
Brood](http://octaviasbrood.com/), an engrossing collection of SF short
stories written by activists and organizers. Of course, social justice
organizing is often driven by a vision of a future better than the one
we live in. But something deeper is going on here: a recognition that
the future, despite its intangibility, is directly impacting us today.
[Take US politics. The election campaign that lifted 45 to the
presidency was premised largely on fear of the future. In his speeches
and tweets, 45 conjured an imagined future in which the US is overrun by
"terrorists," "rapists," and "criminals" from across our borders. In
this racist, dystopian future, white people sacrifice power and safety
amid hostile aliens. This future is not real in any concrete sense. And
yet, it affects the present in multiple ways --- increasing support for
racist policies, emboldening white supremacist organizations, and
igniting hate crimes, just to name a few. In this sense, the future is
what Andrew Baldwin calls a "permanent virtuality," unreal and yet
ever-present]{.underline}.6 Scholars have taken to using the term
futurity to explore these interactions between past, present, and
future. From my reading, futurity refers to three main dynamics: [The
ways that the future is defined (or "rendered knowable") through
practices such as prediction, projection, imagination, prefiguration,
and prophecy;7 The ways that the future impacts the present, for example
through fear, hope, preparation, and preemption;8and The ways that our
thoughts and actions in reference to the future make some futures more
likely, and others less likely, to come about]{.underline}.9 In his book
[Cruising Utopia](https://nyupress.org/books/9780814757284/), José
Esteban Muñoz proposes that queerness is a kind of futurity.
"Queerness," he writes in the book's introduction, "is not yet
here...Put another way, we are not yet queer."10 Instead, he explains,
queerness is an ideal. It is a utopian vision that can help us to see
beyond our everyday restrictions toward new possibilities. We cannot
touch queerness with our hands, or claim to fully know what it is. We
can, however, get glimpses of it, particularly in the realm of cultural
production. Through poems, plays, visual art, dance, and other types of
performance, artists can step away from what Munoz calls "straight time"
--- that sense that the present is natural and enduring --- to suggest
alternative futurities. The concept of futurity seems to have been most
fully developed by Indigenous scholars and activists. [As Native
scholars have shown, settler colonialism (the kind of colonialism we
have in the US, where the colonizer comes to stay) involves an ongoing
project of erasure and replacement.11 After all, settler claims to the
land in the Americas, the Pacific Islands, and elsewhere only make sense
if the original inhabitants are gone. And, despite centuries of
genocide, they are not. Part of the modern settler project, then, is to
erase Indigenous peoples --- if not physically (through policies that
deny land, health care, etc.) or culturally (through blood quantum tests
or the forced removal of children), then at least from popular
consciousness. Movies, television shows, school curricula, political
speeches, news reports, and other media relegate "the Indian" to our
past --- a sad chapter in history, perhaps, but nothing to concern
ourselves with as we dream of the future. By erasing Indigenous people
from the present and the future, these discourses advance the cause of
what scholars like Eve Tuck call settler futurity. In other words, these
discourses are premised on, and help to bring about, a future of endless
settler dominance over the land and all that is on/of it.12 Indigenous
communities, though, are (re)claiming the future --- opening up space
for indigenous futurities to flourish.13 To advance indigenous futurity
is to assert, and takes steps to make possible, futures outside of
settler colonialism. We can get glimpses of indigenous futurities in the
social movement organizing of [Idle No More](http://www.idlenomore.ca/),
among the water protectors at [Standing
Rock](http://standwithstandingrock.net/), in the Indigenous media
production of [Indian and Cowboy](http://indianandcowboy.ca/), and in
everyday assertions of Native culture and sovereignty. Noelani
Goodyear-Kaʻōpua writes that, although they are often framed as relics
of the past, Indigenous communities are actually at the front lines of
the struggle to protect the future. Writing about Native Hawaiian
efforts to defend cultural and natural resources, she notes that "When
colonial discourses frame blockades at Newcastle or on Mauna a Wākea as
obstructions on a march to "the future," they miss the ways this kind of
activism is actually protecting the possibilities of multiple
futures."14 This work is rooted deeply in Indigenous cultural practices
and [epistemologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology), which,
according to Hawaiian activist and blogger Bryan Kamaoli Kuwada, have
always attended to both the past and the future. "The future is a realm
we have inhabited for thousands of years. You cannot do otherwise when
you rely on the land and sea to survive.]{.underline} All of our
gathering practices and agricultural techniques, the patterned mat of
loʻi kalo, the breath passing in and out of the loko iʻa, the Kū and
Hina of picking plants are predicated on looking ahead. This ensures
that the land is productive into the future, that the sea will still be
abundant into the future, and that our people will still thrive into the
future."15 A Final Note When I was coming up in the world of social
justice arts and organizing, much of the focus was on history. [We
studied how injustices like racism and colonialism were historically
constructed. We learned how histories of activism and rebellion had been
hidden, rewritten, and co-opted to reinforce the right of those in power
to rule. We supported youth as they came to see themselves as part of
long social movement traditions. This focus on the past was, and is,
terribly important. At the same time, I am energized by what I see as a
growing emphasis on the future as an arena of active
struggle.]{.underline} Because that's certainly how those in power see
it. [Wall street traders are gambling on our futures. Tech companies are
redesigning our futures. Hollywood is whitewashing our futures. And all
the while, unfettered capitalism is foreclosing so many healthy futures
for this planet. Imagining alternative futures is, quite literally, a
matter of life and death. The struggle for futurity is on, and as
artists and cultural workers we are right in the middle of it, whether
we know it or not]{.underline}. It's time to accept the invitation of
Bryan Kamaoli Kuwada: ["We live in the future," he writes. "Come join
us."16]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Settler Innocence

#### The alternative is [settler innocence]{.underline} through hypothetically imagining the end of settler colonialism within a settler subject position

**Tuck and Yang 12** \[Eve is an award winning scholar in field of
Indigenous studies and educational research \["Decolonization is not a
metaphor" pg 1-40\]//Mberhe

**[There is a long and bumbled history of non-Indigenous peoples making
moves to alleviate the impacts of colonization.]{.underline}** The
too-easy [adoption of decolonizing discourse]{.underline} (making
decolonization a metaphor) is just one part of that history and it [taps
into pre-existing tropes]{.underline} that get in the way of more
meaningful potential alliances. [We think of the enactment of these
tropes]{.underline} **[as a series of moves to innocence]{.underline}**
(Malwhinney, 1998), which problematically attempt to reconcile settler
guilt and complicity, and rescue settler futurity. Here, to explain why
decolonization is and requires more than a metaphor, we discuss some of
these moves to innocence: As an Indigenous scholar and a
settler/trespasser/scholar writing together, we have used forward
slashes to reflect our discrepant positionings in our pronouns
throughout this essay. i. Settler nativism ii. Fantasizing adoption iii.
Colonial equivocation iv. Conscientization v. At risk-ing / Asterisk-ing
Indigenous peoples vi. Re-occupation and urban homesteading [Such moves
ultimately represent settler fantasies of easier paths to
reconciliation.]{.underline} Actually, we argue, attending to what is
irreconcilable within settler colonial relations and what is
incommensurable between decolonizing projects and other social justice
projects will help to reduce the frustration of attempts at solidarity;
but the attention won't get anyone off the hook from the hard,
unsettling work of decolonization. Thus, we also include a discussion of
interruptions that unsettle innocence and recognize incommensurability.

### 2AC -- SCT Bad

This [structuralism gives many within settler colonial studies a
particular orientation towards Indigenous resistance and
scholarship]{.underline}. Australian scholar Tim Rowse argues that
[critical settler perspectives on colonialism can 'reproduce that
sorrowing form of attention in which defeat and marginality are
highlighted at the expense of understanding the nature and limits of the
Indigenous agency that circumstances afforded']{.underline}. 71 He and
others suggest that this sort of analysis caricatures Indigenous
responses, presenting a false binary between resistance/sovereignty and
co-optation in the colonizing process.72 [This]{.underline}, they
suggest, **[leads scholars to position one sort of Indigenous response
as more valid and authentic than others, re-performing the authority
settlers have always claimed over definitions of Indigenous
reality]{.underline}**. Joanne [Barker identifies a 'troubled focus
within settler colonial studies on structure to the erasure of
Indigenous experiences and perspectives about colonialism even within
analyses of the "logic of elimination" that fuels colonial processes of
social formation.]{.underline}' 73 [SCT may be revelatory to many
settler scholars**, but Indigenous people have been speaking for a long
time about colonial continuities based on their lived
experiences**]{.underline}.74 Some [SCTs have sought to connect with
these discussions and to foreground Indigenous resistance, survival and
agency]{.underline}.75 [Others]{.underline}, however, **[seem to use SCT
as a pathway to explain the colonial encounter without engaging with
Indigenous people and experiences]{.underline}** -- [either on the
grounds that this structural analysis already conceptually explains
Indigenous experience]{.underline}, [or because Indigenous resistance is
rendered invisible]{.underline}. In these cases, **[the structuralism of
SCT theory can be mobilized to actively reinforce settler colonial
authority and to participate in the attempted erasure of Indigenous
independence.]{.underline}** We argue that Australian scholar Dirk
Moses76 deploys SCT in his analysis of the NT intervention in ways that
clearly demonstrate this potential re-inscription of colonial
authority.77 Moses, perhaps more than some others, recognizes the
radical implications of settler colonial analysis. He acknowledges that
because 'Australia remains a settler colonial entity,' the Indigenous
'experience of disintegration is intense ... in the face of a White
settler colony determined to assimilate the "Native" other. Cultural
survival is, then, a pressing issue for Indigenous leaders and
intellectuals'. 78 In his recent pieces on contemporary Australian
Indigenous policy, [Moses deploys postcolonial and SCT to evaluate the
responses of Indigenous intellectuals and political
leaders]{.underline}, [leveraging theory and his status as a settler
intellectual to provide an account of Indigeneity]{.underline}. He seeks
to both encompass Indigenous experiences of colonization and offer an
assessment of appropriate Indigenous survival strategies. [Ultimately,
Moses uses SCT to argue that, for their own good, Indigenous people must
give up the struggle for survival in order to release themselves from
violence and find freedom and policy agency.]{.underline}

### 2AC - Scholarship turn

#### Critical theories which attempt to conceptualize and solve indigenous struggles ignore the unique nature of the Native American predicament; this mutes and marginalizes American Indian intellectualism

[Until Indians resolve for themselves a comfortable modern identity that
can be used to energize reservation institutions, radical changes will
not be of much assistance]{.underline}. (Deloria & Lytle, 1984, p. 266)
Our struggle at the moment is to continue to survive and work toward a
time when we can replace the need for being preoccupied with survival
with a more responsible and peaceful way of living within communities
and with the everchanging landscape that will ever be our only home.
(Warrior, 1995, p. 126) Broadly speaking, [this article focuses on the
intersection between dominant modes of critical pedagogy\' and American
Indian intellectualism]{.underline}.2 At present, [critical theories are
often indiscriminately employed to explain the sociopolitical conditions
of all marginalized peoples]{.underline}. As a result, [many Indigenous
scholars view the current liberatory project as simply the latest in a
long line of political endeavors that fails to consider American Indians
as a unique populations]{.underline}. Thus, while [critical pedagogy may
have propelled mainstream educational theory and practice along the path
of social justice]{.underline}, I argue that [it has muted and thus
marginalized the distinctive concerns of American Indian intellectualism
and education]{.underline}. As such, I argue further that the particular
history of imperialism enacted upon Indigenous peoples requires a
reevaluation of dominant views of democracy and social justice, and of
the universal validity of such emancipatory projects - including
critical pedagogy. It is not that critical pedagogy is irrelevant to
Indigenous peoples, as they clearly experience op\[pression, but rather
that [the deep structures of the \"pedagogy of oppression\" fail to
consider American Indians as a categorically different population,
virtually incomparable to other minority groups. To assert this is not
to advocate any kind of hierarchy of oppression but merely to call
attention to the fundamental difference of what it means to be a
sovereign and tribal people within the geopolitical confines of the
United States.]{.underline} Previous examinations of the potential for
critical theory to inform Indigenous pedagogy (Grande, 1997, 2000)
expose significant tensions in their deep theoretical structures. For
instance, insofar as critical theorists retain \"democracy\" as the
central struggle concept of liberation, they fail to recognize
Indigenous peoples\' historical battles to resist absorption into the
\"democratic imaginary\"4 and their contemporary struggles to retain
tribal sovereignty. In fact, it could be argued that the forces of
\"democracy\" have done more to imperil American Indian nations then
they have to sustain them (e.g., the extension of democracy in the form
of civil rights and citizenship has acted as a powerful if not lethal
colonizing force when imposed on the intricate tribal, clan, and kinship
systems of traditional Native communities). Compounding the tensions
between American Indian intellectualism and critical pedagogy is the
fact that [American Indian scholars have, by and large, resisted
engagement with critical theory,5 and concentrated instead on the
production of historical monographs, ethnographic studies, tribally
centered curricula, and site-based research.]{.underline} Such a focus
stems from the fact that [most American Indian scholars feel compelled
to address the political urgencies of their own communities, against
which engagement in abstract theory appears to be a luxury and privilege
of the academic elite]{.underline}. [While I recognize the need for
practically based research, I argue that the ever increasing global
encroachment on American Indian lands, resources, cultures, and
communities points to the equally urgent need to build political
coalitions and formulate transcendent theories of
liberation.]{.underline} Moreov er, while individual tribal needs are in
fact great, I believe that, unless the boundaries of coalition are
expanded to include non-Indian communities, Indian nations will remain
vulnerable to whims of the existing social order. The combined effect of
internal neglect and external resistance to critical pedagogy has pushed
American Indian intellectualism to the margins of critical discourse.
This reality raises a series of important questions that help form the
basis of this discussion: 1. Insofar as critical theory remains
disconnected from the work of American Indian scholars, how do its
language and epistemic frames serve as homogenizing agents when
interfaced with the conceptual and analytical categories persistent
within American Indian educational history and intellectualism? 2. How
has the resistance of American Indian intellectuals to critical theory
contributed to the general lack of analyses on the impact of racism
(and, for that matter, other \"isms\") within American Indian
communities? 3. How have the marginalization of critical scholarship and
the concomitant fascination with cultural/literary forms of American
Indian writing contributed to the preoccupation with parochial questions
of identity and authenticity? And, how have these obsessions about
identity concealed the social-political realities facing American Indian
communities? While the above questions provide the foundation for a
broad discussion of the intersection of critical theory and American
Indian intellectualism, I submit that the main source of tension is
embedded in their competing notions of identity - one rooted in Western
definitions of the civil society and the other in the traditional
structures of tribal society. In terms of identity, critical theorists
aim to explode the concretized categories of race, class, gender, and
sexuality and to claim the intersections the borderlands - as the space
to create a new culture - una cultures mestiza - in which the only
normative standard is hybridity and all subjects are constructed as
inherently transgressive.6 [Though American Indian intellectuals support
the notion of hybridity, they remain skeptical of the new mestiza as a
possible continuation of the colonialist project to fuse Indians into
the national model of the democratic citizen. There is, in other words,
an undercurrent to the postcolonial lexicon of mestizaje that seems to
undermine the formation of \"a comfortable modern American Indian
identity\"]{.underline} (Deloria & Lytle, 1984, p. 266). More
specifically, I argue that the contemporary pressures of ethnic fraud,
corporate commodification, and culture loss render the critical notion
of \"transgressive\" identity highly problematic for Indigenous peoples.
As such, the primary argument is that [critical efforts to promote
mestizaje as the basis of a new cultural democracy does not fully
consider Indigenous struggles to sustain the cultural and political
integrity of American Indian communities.]{.underline} That being said,
it is important to note that [American Indian critical studies are
perceived by both Indigenous and non-Indigenous scholars as a
\"dangerous discourse\" equally threatening to the fields of critical
pedagogy and American Indian intellectualism.7 After all, American
Indian critical studies would compel \"Whitestream\" advocates of
critical theory to ask how their knowledge and practices may have
contributed and remained blind to the continued exploitation of
Indigenous peoples.]{.underline} Specifically, it would require a deeper
recognition that these are not postcolonial times, that
\"globalization\" is simply the new metaphor for imperialism, and that
current constructions of democracy continue to presume the eventual
absorption of Indigenous peoples. For American Indian intellectuals, the
infusion of critical studies would require a movement away from the
safety of unified, essentialized, and idealized constructions of
American Indianness toward more complicated readings of American Indian
formations of power and identity, particularly those that take into
account the existence of internal oppression. Specifically, it would
compel American Indian intellectuals to confront the taboo subjects of
racism, sexism, and homophobia within American Indian communities.

### 2AC -- Politics Necessary/Agonism

#### Movements towards reconciliation are fundamentally political -- only by embracing this aspect of reconciliation can result in new political orientations 

**Verdeja 17** (Verdeja, Ernesto. "Political Reconciliation in
Postcolonial Settler Societies." International Political Science Review,
vol. 38, no. 2, Mar. 2017, pp. 227--241, doi:10.1177/0192512115624517.
Ernesto Verdeja holds a joint appointment in the Department of Political
Science and the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies. He is
the author of Unchopping a Tree: Reconciliation in the Aftermath of
Political Violence (Temple University Press, 2009).) //bc

Rather than treat antagonisms as anti-political, Mouffe argues that [a
theory of democracy must begin with the fact of antagonism and develop
the theoretical framework and tools to address, rather than eliminate,
the danger it poses]{.underline} (Mouffe, 2000: 80--88). [It is
necessary to transform antagonistic violence into agonistic
relations]{.underline}: [those relations that do not result in the
destruction of shared political life, but establish the conditions for a
vibrant but tolerant contest between groups that espouse different
identities and normative orientations.]{.underline} This [agonistic
democracy represents a significant radicalization of democratic
life]{.underline}, for [it places at the center of political discourse
those groups that otherwise remain marginalized]{.underline}, or even
excluded, [by majoritarian and consensus-based democratic
politics]{.underline}. As such, agonistic theory questions the very
boundary used to distinguish who does and does not belong to the demos.
Several theorists have taken the insights of agonistic theory and
applied them to the question of political reconciliation. Andrew Schaap
proposes that [any account of reconciliation must avoid a strong
communitarian ethic that privileges shared identity and social harmony
as the end point of post-conflict politics]{.underline}. For Schaap,
[reconciliation must be open to "accepting the risk of
politics]{.underline} (**[and the opportunity it
presents]{.underline}**) [rather than eliding it"]{.underline} (2005:
20). [Accepting this risk not only opens to debate specific policy
recommendations]{.underline}---[on the appropriateness of reparations,
the role of an official apology, and the like]{.underline}---**[but
explicitly challenges the very terms of reconciliation
itself]{.underline}**. [Agonism deepens the political dimension of
reconciliation by creating a space for alternative articulations of
coexistence]{.underline}, [while retaining the conflictive experiences
without which politics is impossible]{.underline}. Paul Muldoon and
Andrew Schaap argue that [reconciliation politics "tend to be" agonistic
because they "open up a space of contestation and disagreement in
relation to the claims identity groups make as victims of
injustice]{.underline}" (Muldoon and Schaap, 2012: 182). Furthermore,
drawing attention to the distinctly agonistic elements of reconciliation
politics raises questions about who gets to establish the boundaries of
legitimate political discourse and collective identity, for it
scrutinizes the legitimacy of the very state whose origins are rooted in
historical injustices against indigenous groups. This radicalization,
and opening, of debate further problematizes unreflective conceptions of
historical memory that may otherwise privilege the majority community at
the expense of indigenous communities. [Agonists persuasively argue that
reconciliation is much more than a search for consensus on historical
interpretation and a desire to "move on" after conflict]{.underline}
(Hirsch, 2012a); instead, [reconciliation concerns contestation over the
very boundaries of political discourse,]{.underline} [collective
identity and the status of democratic politics]{.underline}. These
radica[l approaches scrutinize the legitimacy claims of the society that
ostensibly promotes reconciliation]{.underline}, **[and underscore how
normative claims are ultimately expressions of political
power.]{.underline}** The upshot is twofold: [no agreement on a morally
satisfactory account of reconciliation can be developed prior to
political struggle]{.underline}; and, **[reconciliation will remain
incomplete]{.underline}**, for [new forms of contestation and
negotiation over collective identity will always emerge due to the
intrinsically agonistic nature of political life]{.underline}.
Nevertheless, agonism faces at least two challenges for reconciliation
politics.

Theorising Decolonisation For all its attached redemptive prospects and
radical possibilities, it is important to emphasise that the meanings of
decolonisation as both a concept and political project are not just
broad, but also multifaceted and highly contested. What it means to
'undo' colonialism is deeply contextual (Jansen and Osterhammel, 2017).
While colonialism can be defined broadly as a relationship of domination
in which a people or territory is politically and economically
subjugated to a foreign power, actual colonial situations vary quite
widely from each other, depending on, among others, the particular
political systems instituted to maintain control, types of exploitation
and expropriation (resources, labour, plantations), relationship between
the metropole and colony and patterns of migration they compel (slavery,
settlement). [Projects of decolonisation accordingly take different
forms even if they are united by the common concern of ending or
overturning structures of domination instituted by
colonialism]{.underline}, which has historically taken place mostly
through the withdrawal of colonial powers and achievement of
independence for the colonised (Buchanan, 2010). Decolonisation speaks
to the aspiration of self-rule and its concomitant critique of
colonialism as the 'systematic denial of freedom' (Kohn and McBride,
2011: 6) and is therefore entangled with a variety of concerns, namely,
self-determination, justice, equality, freedom and solidarity against
colonialism and imperialism. As Todd Shepherd (2006: 3--4) writes,
decolonisation is 'a much wider concept than the mere "winning of
Independence" or "transfer of power"... It entails the exploration of
dreams, the analysis of struggles, compromises, pledges and
achievements, and the rethinking of fundamentals'. Traditional
literature on decolonisation approached it in terms of the historical
process that began in the immediate aftermath of World War Two in which
countries previously under (typically European) foreign rule
transitioned to constitutional independence (Buchanan, 2010).
Decolonisation was one of the most significant developments of the
twentieth century, radically changing the face of the globe from one in
which a small number of empires had dominion over some 80% of the
earth's surface to an international order based on the principle of
self-determination and made up of ostensibly independent states
(Hopkins, 2008). Scholars in this tradition have done much to illuminate
the wide-reaching structural transformations that accompanied
decolonisation, including the emergence of anti-colonial and national
liberation struggles at the turn of the century, shifts in world economy
that made the maintenance of traditional forms of Empire increasingly
difficult, the development of a 'Third World' political project and the
institutionalisation of human and civic rights principles that rendered
systems based on ideas of racial and ethnic superiority less viable
(Hopkins, 2008: 216). Yet, [the focus on transition has been critiqued
for its narrowness insofar as it seems to take for granted the meanings
of self-determination and temporally restricts decolonisation to the
moment of national liberation.]{.underline} Postcolonial scholars, among
others, have been at the forefront of this charge, arguing that
[decolonisation did not produce a postcolonial world per se, but rather
one that continues to be shaped in significant ways by the legacies of
European colonialism]{.underline} (e.g. Spivak, 1999). As Ella Shohat
(1992) has argued, there is no way of turning back from the world
colonialism set in play nor did colonial modes of domination end with
the formal period of decolonisation. From this broadened perspective[,
[decolonisation is the difficult task]{.mark} of tracing the economic,
political, social, cultural, relational and linguistic consequences of
colonialism and is therefore also an ongoing imaginative project seeking
'a new form of consciousness and way of life']{.underline} (Pieterse and
Parekh, 1995: 3) beyond the coloniality of modern modes of culture,
identity and knowledge more generally. While the transitional focus of
conventional scholarship is quite illuminating in the contexts of Africa
and Asia, for example, it furthermore excludes a great many
decolonisation efforts that have taken place and continue to take place
in other regions. This includes countries that remained dependent or
only achieved semi-independence as dominions, decolonising projects
carried out in territories never formally under colonial rule (the
Iranian Revolution, for instance) and -- as is particularly important to
our discussion here -- settler colonies that only partially decolonised,
whether by way of loosening ties with the Motherland or achieving
independence, but which continue to dominate substantial indigenous
populations (Hopkins, 2008). There is a significant lacuna in the
decolonisation literature when it comes to settler colonialism, which
has increasingly been recognised as a distinct form of colonial practice
-- and one that is particularly resistant to decolonisation (Veracini,
2007). As the transfer of an exogenous population to a territory they
intend to claim as their permanent home, settler colonialism establishes
quite a different structural relationship to 'traditional' forms of
colonialism, especially when settler colonial projects succeed in
creating a state (Bateman and Pilkington, 2011). Rather than governing
native peoples in order to extract resources for economic gain, settler
colonisers instead aim to 'seize their land and push them beyond an
ever-expanding frontier of settlement' (Elkin and Pedersen, 2005: 2).
For Patrick Wolfe (2006), what distinguishes settler colonialism is thus
that it is guided by a logic of elimination as opposed to a logic of
exploitation, wherein the eradication of indigenous presence is
essential to the success of settler colonial projects. [The primacy of
national liberation in the literature makes it especially difficult to
imagine, let alone theorise, decolonisation in many settler colonial
contexts.]{.underline} Whereas some settler colonial projects like
Algeria and Kenya saw decolonisation by way of a mass settler exodus,
paving the way for the establishment of independent states, the more
successful ones established permanent settler communities (e.g. Northern
Ireland) or their own states (e.g. Australia, Canada, the United States)
which preclude a simple transition from foreign rule to sovereign status
(Veracini, 2007). This is of course not to say that self-determination
of the type aspired to by anti-colonial national movements was an easy
or even necessarily achievable task. As Kohn and McBride (2011) suggest,
[in pursuing the dream of self-rule, anti-colonial thinkers had to
reckon with the difficulties of articulating alternative political
foundations that would make for a genuinely self-determining polity, an
enormous task which **[demands decolonising of minds as much
institutions and territory]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see Fanon,
2001\[1963\]). Decolonisation must pursue a convincing 'break' between a
colonial past and a postcolonial future 'through decisive action in the
present'; it must also 'seek to reinterpret the past in such a way that
it may help in the present and future struggle for self-rule' (Kohn and
McBride, 2011: 19). While these pursuits are invariably contingent,
partial and commonly symbolic, national liberation struggles very often
provide the fodder for a reinterpreted past that is robustly positive
and the establishment of an independent state serves as that aspired for
'break'. Settler colonial contexts, especially those where indigenous
peoples live as minorities in settler states, make these types of
symbolic transitions challenging, as they do the imagining of
postcolonial alternatives. If the narrative structure of colonialism is
circular (leave, stay, return), making that symbolic break possible,
settler colonial narratives are linear insofar as the settler comes to
stay and the line continues on unbroken (Veracini, 2007). As Ann
Curthoys (1999: 288) writes, **[[settler colonial spaces are
simultaneously colonial and postcolonial]{.mark}, colonising and
decolonising, [which makes decolonisation]{.mark} temporally [ambivalent
at best]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Lorenzo Veracini (2007) suggests that
there are only two alternatives to settler evacuation for decolonising
settler colonial forms and [it is dubious whether one of these counts as
decolonisation at all: the [decolonisation]{.mark} of
relationships]{.underline} through 'the promotion of various processes
of Indigenous reconciliation' [or the]{.underline} maintenance of the
status quo 'with the [explicit rejection of the possibility of reforming
the settler body politic']{.underline}. Again, **[what the former might
mean [is often vague]{.mark}, and historically it is the decolonisation
of relationships that is hardest to come by considering the
psychological consequences of colonialism for coloniser and colonised
alike]{.underline}** (Memmi, 1965). Like traditional forms of
colonialism, settler colonialism was legitimated by a belief in the
colonised's racial and cultural inferiority. However, the specific
settler colonial pursuit of land seizure compels additional stereotypes
of native peoples or unique applications of existing colonial ones,
wherein their supposed inferiority makes them ill-equipped to develop
that land (pre-modern, nomadic, barbaric) or, alternatively, voids any
claims to ownership (terra nullius). In other words, settler colonialism
is as much premised on the denial of indigenous peoples as a political
constituency with rights to land as it is their purported inferiority,
which is typically enshrined in their status as second-class citizens
with all the economic, cultural and social disadvantage this entails
(Bateman and Pilkington, 2011: 3). [Given that settler societies are
marked by 'pervasive inequalities, usually codified in law, between
native and settler populations' which preserve]{.underline} political
and economic [privileges for the latter]{.underline} (Elkin and
Pedersen, 2005: 4), **[[decolonising relationships demands structural
changes that often encounter significant resistance from settler
constituencies]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Likewise, it requires a reckoning
with historical injustice -- specifically violence and conflict at the
colonial frontier -- that is challenging for settler states and
populations because it opens questions of settler identity, privileges,
legitimacy and reparations and expressly seeks to scrutinise disavowed
and long suppressed histories. [Settler colonial [decolonisation
is]{.mark} thus [complicated by a multitude of hurdles,]{.mark} which
bring the]{.underline} postcolonial caution of the [impossibility of a
'break' into stark relief.]{.underline} Kohn and McBride (2011) suggest
that [**[decisive action in the present is essential to
decolonisation]{.mark}**, but in settler colonial contexts **[this is
hindered by power discrepancies between settler and native
constituencies,]{.mark} a general [lack of settler political
will]{.mark}** to enter into difficult processes of historical
introspection **[as well as the constraining of Indigenous
claims]{.mark} within the settler state**.]{.underline} Indeed, even a
commitment to a postcolonial polity as expressed through processes of
historical reconciliation often encounters strong resistance when it
comes to judicial, constitutional or legislative change genuinely
decolonised relationships would demand. Nevertheless, even if it remains
difficult to comprehensively imagine the decolonisation of 'settler
societies vis-à-vis Indigenous constituencies' (Veracini, 2007), [[the
central question must be how to construct political foundations
which]{.mark} simultaneously [acknowledge]{.mark} 'the practices of
[racism, violence and subordination']{.mark}]{.underline} (Kohn and
McBride, 2011: 18) [that preceded them [while also **paving the way for
a postcolonial future in which natives and settlers are equal**]{.mark}
**parties [and share the right to narrate the
polity]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Equality, freedom and justice may come
from legally enshrining Indigenous rights to self-determination or,
alternatively, doing away with the categories of 'settler' and 'native'
altogether (Mamdani, 2001). What shape such efforts are likely to take
depends, among others, on the 'size and tenacity' of Indigenous
populations as well as the power of the settler constituency (Elkin and
Pedersen, 2005: 3, 6). But we would suggest that the measure to which
they may be thought of as decolonising rests on the robustness of the
relationship they envision and the space they carve for equal membership
in and to a postcolonial polity.

### 2AC -- Perm -- State Engagement

#### Challenging settler colonialism is not mutually exclusive with engaging the state -- government interactions are a better site of indigenous-settler cooperation -- empirics prove 

**Steinman 16** (Steinman, Erich W. "Decolonization Not Inclusion:
Indigenous Resistance to American Settler Colonialism." Sociology of
Race and Ethnicity, vol. 2, no. 2, Apr. 2016, pp. 219--236,
doi:10.1177/2332649215615889) //bc

[Challenging settler colonialism involves advancing possible
alternatives to the logic of substitution]{.underline}. In the history
of settler-indigenous interaction in North America, many possibilities
for sustained mixed communities, social and political amalgamation, or
the formal inclusion of Indian nations in the union have appeared---and
have been definitively rejected by settler citizens, courts, and
officials. Veracini (2010:95) asserted that there is a narrative deficit
for decolonizing settler colonialism. However, as noted in previous
scholarship, [tribal leaders in the United States have in the past 30
years advocated for and have partly created structures implementing the
coexistence of tribal governments alongside state and local settler
governments]{.underline} (Steinman 2005). Similar agreements and
arrangements in Canada are more problematic, because of a weaker
standing for indigenous rights in Canadian jurisprudence (Coulthard
2014; Gover 2013:189--90). [It may be even more difficult to decolonize
relationships and interactions in nongovernmental fields,]{.underline}
**[where individuals are less exposed to information about tribal
nationhood and are less bound by laws,]{.underline}** **[policies, and
shared practical interests]{.underline}**. [Without disruptions of
settler colonialism's normative power]{.underline}, [interactions with
and even alliances between Natives and non-Native peoples are located
"in power-laden discursive and institutional relationships, whether they
wish or not]{.underline}" (Morgensen 2011:229; Steinman 2011a). At least
two modes of indigenous action are perceptible in response to this
challenge. [The first involves critically educating non-indigenous
allies and aiding their efforts to educate others about settler
colonialism. In the context of bitter treaty rights conflicts in
Wisconsin in the 1980s and 1990s, tribal fishermen asked non-Native
allies to train other supportive individuals, so that the latter could
appropriately support tribal rights by serving as "witnesses" and
provide a buffer between intimidating protestors and vulnerable tribal
members fishing at night]{.underline} (Nesper 2002). More proactively,
[in 2009 Dakota activists taught a 10-week course, "Dakota
Decolonization: Solidarity Education for Allies,"]{.underline} in
Minneapolis [that led to the creation of the Unsettling Minnesota
collective, which in turn produced the sourcebook Deconstructing
Colonial Mentality]{.underline} (Unsettling Minnesota 2009). Second,
**[indigenous leaders highlight past respectful indigenous-settler
relations and invite settlers to reclaim such honorable
interactions.]{.underline}** In New York, ind[igenous leaders and
nations provided support and guidance to the "Two Row Wampum Renewal
Campaign,]{.underline}" [honoring the 400-year-old treaty relationship
between the Iroquois Confederacy and colonists and their settler
successors]{.underline}. The relationship that this first covenant
formalized was one that Indians originally understood to be based on
"peace and friendship," rather than merely legalistic or purely
conflictual (Williams 1997). Heeding Onondaga direction, **[the
educational and advocacy campaign launched in 2013 sought to create a
decolonized understanding of history and to build local and regional
foundations for respectful relationships]{.underline}** (Manno 2014). In
more specific substantive fields, [various types of new symbolic and
material arrangements are being advanced. Those articulating Native
science are not only seeking to promote tribal access to and benefits
from indigenous knowledge, and gain respect for it (Trafzer, Gilbert,
and Madrigal 2008), but propose it as a complement to Western science.
From applied science education programs at the secondary school level to
college courses and academic conference keynote speakers, the advocates
of Native science are working to carve out relations of coexistence in
educational structures. Similarly, they have been inserting Native
science into grassroots environmental and climate change
efforts]{.underline} (Nelson 2008).

### 2AC -- Reform

#### Reform is not monolithic -- there are instances when state engagement is necessary and useful.

AD: In an interview you did with Glen Coulthard, you asked him a
question about [state engagement versus disengagement.]{.underline} I
want to ask you the same question: [How do we determine when and how to
turn away]{.underline}? HW: I think **[the disengagement versus
engagement dichotomy is false]{.underline}**, **[just as the reform
versus revolution debate is reductive]{.underline}**. Even **[if our
long-term vision is turned away from the state, in the short term we may
have to engage with the state]{.underline}** --- things like [dealing
with the courts or calling the cops to address gender violence
etc.]{.underline} Part of the reason [someone may decide to rely on the
police is because our community accountability mechanisms are
dismal.]{.underline} I asked Glen that question because [I don't think
it's a simple answer]{.underline}. [Despite my vision to disengage with
the state, the reality is that I end up engaging with the state every
day]{.underline} especially when supporting marginalized women. I am
[not suggesting that engagement versus disengagement with the state is
simply a temporal distinction]{.underline}, as [many alternatives to the
state do exist in the immediate.]{.underline} It is more of a practical
and contextual consideration for me. [The main principle]{.underline} I
work around [in these individual instances is the principle of
self-determination.]{.underline} If I am supporting someone facing
deportation or partner violence, what do they need? Are there effective
alternatives to the state that exist that I can suggest or do they feel
the need to engage with the state in order to reduce harm or to access
safety? AD: As a general answer that seems really helpful because
**[that answer makes it concrete immediately in terms of specific needs
and specific situations]{.underline}**. And it [pushes back on the
traditional "reform versus revolution"]{.underline} version of the
question. In prison abolition work, I heard the language of "reformist
reforms" versus "non-reformist reforms" being used more and more, and
I'm wondering if that language makes sense based on the concrete
situations you're invoking here: a reform that reinforces the system
versus a reform that requires a different system. HW: Yes, I think so.
[Arguably every reform entrenches the power of the state because it
gives the state the power to implement that reform]{.underline}. [But
from an ethical orientation towards emancipation,]{.underline} I think
[a guiding question on non-reformist reforms is: Is it increasing the
possibility of freedom?]{.underline} In the context of detention centers
and prisons, there are tangible differences between various kinds of
reforms. Locally, we are in the period of a state inquest after the
tragic death of a Mexican migrant woman Lucia Vega Jimenez in
immigration detention. [There are now a number of reform-based
recommendations on the table coming from legal organizations, NGO's and
state-based agencies]{.underline}. Our allies and us put forward our
vision for an end to all deportations and detentions, and then [we
supported those specific necessary reforms that detainees over the years
have talked about that would increase their access to the outside world
-- for example, increased access to phones, computers, and legal
advice.]{.underline} Conversely, one of the proposed reforms that we did
not support was a GPS electronic bracelet as an alternative to
incarceration. This is forcing people to incarcerate their own body and
their home becomes their cages. Another reform we opposed was more
cameras in prisons. Even though it was pitched under the guise of
"keeping detainees safe," surveillance is less about safety and more
about invasion of privacy and increased social control. So that was how
we decided---[is the reform increasing the possibility of freedom or is
it incarceration and control in another form?]{.underline}

This essay is an examination of an emerging form of asymmetric warfare;

following material might appear to some as a, "terrorist operations
manual." It isn\'t. Operational information has been intentionally

I\'m stating, clearly and emphatically, that what follows is intended

INTRODUCTION The germ of this essay was a Wired article about electronic
piracy called, "[The Shadow
Internet](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.01/topsite.html)."[1](http://cryptogon.com/docs/pirate_insurgency.html#sdendnote1sym)
The following Cryptogon analysis will focus on [the nature of insurgency
in the U.S. and critical national security aspects of electronic piracy
that the article failed to address.]{.underline} The Wired article does
not mention that there is now a strong ideological motivation driving
some actors in the piracy scene. Back in the 1980s, piracy was mostly
for the fun of it, as the article indicates. Now, though, some militant
anarchists see piracy as a way of bankrupting corporations and view
their activities as a form of warfare against corporations and the
governments that serve them. The supporting material for this statement
is available on the Internet. I will not provide direct links to
information related to the operational aspects of militant electronic
piracy because doing so could subject me to criminal
prosecution.[2](http://cryptogon.com/docs/pirate_insurgency.html#sdendnote2sym)
This analysis will use the term "militant electronic piracy" to refer to
the high level, massive theft and distribution of copyrighted material
for purposes of politico-economic warfare. This may be viewed in stark
contrast to the more ubiquitous activity of "file trading," where
individuals use peer-to-peer software to download music, movies and
software for free. Casual file traders ascribe no political motivation
whatsoever to their actions. "The American Corporate State," (ACS)
refers to the existing power structure in the U.S. [This system is
characterized by the fascist convergence of corporate and government
interests.[3](http://cryptogon.com/docs/pirate_insurgency.html#sdendnote3sym)
In order to understand the national security implications of militant
electronic piracy, an examination of conventional insurgency against the
American Corporate State is necessary. THE NATURE OF ARMED INSURGENCY
AGAINST THE ACS Any violent insurgency against the ACS is sure to fail
and will only serve to enhance the state\'s power. The major flaw of
violent insurgencies,]{.underline} both cell based (Weathermen
Underground, Black Panthers, Aryan Nations etc.) and leaderless (Earth
Liberation Front, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, etc.) [is
that they are attempting to attack the system using the same tactics the
ACS has already mastered: terror and psychological
operations]{.underline}. [The ACS attained primacy through the effective
application of terror and psychological operations. Therefore, it has
far more skill and experience in the use of these tactics than any
upstart could ever hope to
attain.[4](http://cryptogon.com/docs/pirate_insurgency.html#sdendnote4sym)
This makes the ACS impervious to traditional insurgency
tactics]{.underline}. - Political Activism and the ACS Counterinsurgency
Apparatus The ACS employs a full time counterinsurgency infrastructure
with resources that are unimaginable to most would be insurgents. [Quite
simply, violent insurgents have no idea of just how powerful the foe
actually is]{.underline}. Violent insurgents typically start out as
peaceful, idealistic, political activists. Whether or not political
activists know it, even with very mundane levels of political activity,
they are engaging in low intensity conflict with the ACS. The U.S.
military classifies political activism as "low intensity conflict." The
scale of warfare (in terms of intensity) begins with individuals
distributing anti-government handbills and public gatherings with
anti-government/anti-corporate themes. In the middle of the conflict
intensity scale are what the military refers to as Operations Other than
War; an example would be the situation the U.S. is facing in Iraq. At
the upper right hand side of the graph is global thermonuclear war. What
is important to remember is that the military is concerned with ALL
points along this scale because they represent different types of
threats to the ACS. Making distinctions between civilian law enforcement
and military forces, and foreign and domestic intelligence services is
no longer necessary. After September 11, 2001, all national security
assets would be brought to bare against any U.S. insurgency movement.
Additionally, the U.S. military established NORTHCOM which designated
the U.S. as an active military operational area. Crimes involving the
loss of corporate profits will increasingly be treated as acts of
terrorism and could garner anything from a local law enforcement
response to activation of regular military forces. Most of what is
commonly referred to as "political activism" is viewed by the corporate
state\'s counterinsurgency apparatus as a useful and necessary component
of political control. Letters-to-the-editor\...
Calls-to-elected-representatives\... Waving banners\... "Third" party
political activities\... Taking beatings, rubber bullets and tear gas
from riot police in free speech zones\... [Political activism amounts to
an utterly useless waste of time, in terms of tangible power, which is
all the ACS understands. Political activism is a cruel guise that is
sold to people who are dissatisfied, but who have no concept of the
nature of tangible power.]{.underline} Counterinsurgency teams routinely
monitor these activities, attend the meetings, join the groups and take
on leadership roles in the organizations. It\'s only a matter of time
before some individuals determine that political activism is a honeypot
that accomplishes nothing and wastes their time. The corporate state
knows that some small percentage of the peaceful, idealistic, political
activists will eventually figure out the game. At this point, the
clued-in activists will probably do one of two things; drop out or move
to escalate the struggle in other ways. If the clued-in activist drops
his or her political activities, the ACS wins. But what if the clued-in
activist refuses to give up the struggle? Feeling powerless, desperation
could set in and these individuals might become increasingly
radicalized. Because the corporate state\'s counterinsurgency operatives
have infiltrated most political activism groups, the radicalized members
will be easily identified, monitored and eventually compromised/turned,
arrested or executed. The ACS wins again. - ACS Full-Spectrum PSYOP
Dominance [The ACS wields the most powerful weapon of political control
the world has ever seen: the mass media. This is the corporate state\'s
trump card against leaderless resistance movements which are impossible
to infiltrate and compromise by counter-insurgency teams. The appearance
of legitimacy is all that matters in a low intensity conflict, and the
ACS, with the corporate media running continuous propaganda and
perception management campaigns, represents the final solution to what
the public will view as
legitimate.]{.underline}[5](http://cryptogon.com/docs/pirate_insurgency.html#sdendnote5sym)
[All anti-corporate/anti-government political activism will be portrayed
by the ACS as lunatic muckraking and a potential hotbed of terrorism.
All violent insurgency activities will be portrayed as terrorist acts.
(Some criminal activity is now considered terrorism by the ACS.) The
behavior of the ACS will be represented as just, measured and prudent,
regardless of the ghastly nature of its atrocities. The general
population will be bombarded with images, sound bites and articles about
the threats posed by the "terrorists." In other words, the population,
rather then fearing the state and its continuous cryptofascist
operations and more overt international war crimes and economic
exploitation, will come to view the insurgents as a threat and the ACS
as their savior]{.underline}. The ACS can punctuate the point by
unleashing false flag terror incidents on the population while
conveniently blaming any organization it wishes, including other
states.[6](http://cryptogon.com/docs/pirate_insurgency.html#sdendnote6sym)
The general population will respond by supporting: foreign wars, the
diminution of individual rights, and legislation and funding that adds
to the power of the corporate state. Some simple analogies might help to
clarify the realities facing an armed insurgency in the United States.
Could a 5 year old beat a university mathematics professor in a
mathematics contest? Could an ape beat a grand champion at chess? Could
a high school basketball team beat the Los Angeles Lakers at basketball?
[Could an armed insurgency overthrow the American Corporate State? The
obvious answer to all of these questions is: NO.]{.underline} Some
insurgents, having determined that terror and psyops will obviously fail
against the ACS, sought out other means of attacking this extremely
powerful foe.

In the case of the United States, **[private corporations and the
military (the government agency) have made the military industrial
complex big business for America's corporate elite]{.underline}**. John
Feffer points out in his article, "Globalization and Militarization"
that all [trade accords starting at the 1947 General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) have had a "national security exception" for
military subsides]{.underline}. Feffer explains that [if the U.S.
government subsidizes fighter jets rather than a passenger jet, other
nations cannot file grievances against the United States through
international organizations such as the World Trade
Organization]{.underline} (WTO). **[It is no wonder that the United
States is "the world's largest weapons producer, exporter, and
subsidizer]{.underline}**"" [and the globe a more heavily militarized
planet since U.S. foreign aid is often given in the form of military
aid]{.underline}. American [settlers]{.underline}, born into a predatory
culture, **[see imperialist policies as being "good for
business."]{.underline}** Economist James Cypher refers to the U.S.
military industrial complex as the "Iron Triangle." On [one side of a
triangulated relationship is the "civilian" government that "shape(s)
US. military polic]{.underline}y---[the Office of the President, the
National Security Council, the Senate and House \| Armed Services
Committees]{.underline}, [and civilian agencies like the CIA and NSA."
Ona second side is the military institutions]{.underline} (the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, the four branches of the military, the CINCs). [Lastly,
the base of the triangle consists of "the 85,000 private firms that
profit from the military contracting system."]{.underline} Halliburton,
one of the world's largest energy service corporations, is an example of
a private corporation, which benefits from an intimate relationship with
the U.S. government. Halliburton boasts that it has a "rich heritage" of
contract work with the military. After the 1990s Gulf War, Halliburton
brought the burning oil wells under control. Later, its subsidiary,
Brown & Root (now Kellogg, Brown & Root), supplied "U.S. peacekeeping
forces in Bosnia, Croatia, and Hungary with food, laundry,
transportation and other lifecycle management services."" Then, during
the "war on terrorism," Brown & Root again received a ten-year contract
to supply the military operations in Afghanistan and Uzbekistan with
service support (laundry, food service, etc.) as well as to assist other
military projects." Halliburton is not an "outside" contractor bidding
on a government job, but part of an established military monopoly. For
example, current Vice President Dick Cheney was also the former
Secretary of Defense who led the Operation Desert Storm during the 1990
\~--- 1991 Gulf War. While under Cheney's leadership, the Department of
Defense gave the contract to extinguish the burning oil wells to
Halliburton, which subsequently made Cheney its CEO in 1995. It is no
surprise that Brown & Root was awarded the Central Asia service support
contract in December 2001 given Vice President \| Dick Cheney's
connections. Moreover, during Cheney's tenure as CEO, . Halliburton
began business ventures in Turkmenistan, one of the Caspian Sea / basin
states."

#### Arms sales by global hegemons are used as a tool to oppress 3rd world populations and uphold Manifest Destiny

Clay **Jason** 19**87** \[December, Cultural Survival, "ARMED STRUGGLE
AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLE"\] \[DS\]
\[https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/armed-struggle-and-indigenous-people\]

[A number of countries use the manufacture and sale of arms to subsidize
their own public or private industries or to finance new lines of
weapons]{.underline}. The [US]{.underline}, USSR, China, England and
France [have long been known as arms dealers for the rest of the
world]{.underline}; in fact, the USSR recently passed the US as the
world\'s major supplier of weapons. Israel, fearing dependence on
foreign arms suppliers, has a large weapons production program
[subsidized by sales of weapons to developing countries]{.underline}.
Israel recently sold weapons and provided technical advisers to the
governments of Guatemala and Sri Lanka to support each government\'s
attacks on and armed conflicts with distinct cultural groups. And along
with other countries implicated in the \"contragate\" hearings, [Israel
has been used by the US to circumvent laws prohibiting the direct sale
of weapons to specific countries.]{.underline} The issue of arms sales
naturally raises the issue of arms purchases. **[Weapons purchased by
Third World states are almost always used on people who live within
those states. More often than not, the victims belong to tribal groups
being incorporated or forcibly assimilated into a
\"nation.\"]{.underline}** In the past decade, **[weapons sales account
for one-half of Third World debt]{.underline}**. These [purchases use
scarce foreign exchange]{.underline}. In short, arms [take precedence
over essential productive imports, resulting in inflation and an
economic tailspin. The social tension created by these conditions poses
added threats to the ruling group\'s power, which, in turn, prompts the
importation of additional weapons. The cycle continues and the violence
increases. The indebtedness incurred by arming states]{.underline},
[especially in the Third World, has escalated to the point at which
everyone\'s lives are affected by the need to increase exports of cash
commodities while reducing imports of food and other
essentials]{.underline}. [As is often the case, the people or groups on
the bottom rung of society pay a disproportionate price for such
indebtedness. Their lands are invaded and their resources stolen.
Because of inflation, their incomes buy less. They often find that the
imported weapons are used to exact higher taxes, contributions and
payments (including the seizure of their land) to the state - a state
that created the debt in the first place by importing weapons and items
of conspicuous consumption for the elite.]{.underline} This argument may
seem a bit abstract. In real terms, however, [the world spends \$800
billion on arms, a sum equivalent to all Third World debt]{.underline}.
[It has been estimated that less than half of one percent of this sum
could make all countries self-sufficient food producers in 1990. States
spend, on average, \$30,000 per soldier but less than \$500 per
student.]{.underline} Causes of Conflict Many of today\'s armed
struggles share a number of common features, some of which contribute to
the underlying causes of conflict, others to the duration or outcome of
such conflicts. Listed below are some factors that are important
components in understanding conflicts that involve tribal or ethnic
groups. The list is not definitive, and the order of the issues listed
is not significant. When possible, examples of peoples, groups and
states are listed for each category; these, too, are not exhaustive. CSQ
readers are encouraged to expand this list or the examples mentioned
with their own experiences. [The issue of militarization and conflict
seriously threatens indigenous peoples throughout the
world]{.underline}. [Cultural Survival wants to continue its research
and publications in this area, and welcomes your comments on the issues
raised by - or omitted from - this introduction or any of these
articles.]{.underline} Perhaps the most important factors that determine
the intensity, duration and ultimate conclusion of conflicts are the
causes that precipitate them. What are groups fighting to obtain or
retain? Some common areas of conflict suggested in these two issues
include independence, autonomy, self-determination, representation,
local political control, resource control, land rights, religious or
linguistic rights, military conscription and taxes or other state
contributions. How can these causes affect the duration of conflict or
the fighting ability of groups? How are such causes manipulated by
outsider groups, such as states, religious groups and political parties?
These are some of the questions that are discussed below. Size of Group
[Ruling minorities are often threatened - or think they are threatened,
regardless of how passive the majority populations may appear - by
disenfranchised majorities. Repression often occurs in such situations
because of the long-term threat that the minority-dominated state
believes is posed by the majorities. Recent cases of this type that have
involved shooting conflict, displacement and relocation include
Guatemala (whites versus Indians), Ethiopia (Amhara versus Oromo, Anuak,
Tigray, Somali, Komo, Sidamo and Afar), Burundi (Tutsi versus Hutu) and
South Africa (whites versus blacks).]{.underline} Creating a National
Culture In a new state, [a dominant ethnic group - whether a majority or
minority - often attempts to create a national culture (through
religion, language, dress, laws) in its own image. The dominant group
fears the persistence or growth of dominated groups. Israel expresses
great concern that the high birth rate of Arabs will cause them to soon
outnumber Jews. Greater Ethiopia submits to Amharic language and culture
due to the military conquest and colonization of most of the empire
nearly a century ago. In Turkey, Kurdish is technically forbidden and
Armenian churches were looted and dismantled long ago.]{.underline} [The
Indonesian state reportedly converts tribal people to Islam \"on the
point of a sword\" and forces them to wear \"modern\" clothes. In the
1930s, the El Salvador ruling party attacked Indians for wearing
distinctive clothes; Guatemalan soldiers in the early 1980s were taught
to identify some people by the weaving of their clothes and to detain
those from certain areas.]{.underline} Manifest Destiny [Ruling groups
often see their domination, power and authority as a right or
obligation, a form of manifest destiny]{.underline}. [This is true of
the Tutsi in Burundi, Muslims in Sudan, Han Chinese throughout China and
Tibet, Russians throughout the USSR and governments and colonists alike
throughout the Americas, Australia and Indonesia. This belief in a
group\'s destined right to civilize can also apply to religious groups
such as Christians (Protestants, Catholics, Coptics), Muslims or Jews.
Westernized groups or descendants of Western colonists often assume the
superiority of their Western traditions and modern ways over those of
tribal groups, which they believe should be eradicated. **Dominating
groups often use ideology, however, to mask more important economic
motives; dominated groups often come to understand and reject this
manipulation**. This, in turn, can produce volatile
situations.]{.underline}

As a young teacher in the 1990s, I viewed HRE with suspicion. I
associated it with a liberal look toward the international by [Americans
looking for sites to stake their activist identities. Turning
international sometimes meant turning a blind eye toward your present
place and moment]{.underline}. For me, that present place was Oakland,
and other North American cities like it[: cities built and building upon
histories of settlement/displacement, gentrification/ghetto-ization;
cities hatch-marked by the sharp contradictions between urban realities
and urbane privileges]{.underline}. I was particularly discouraged when
the Amnesty International student club at Oakland High, where I was
teaching at the time, decided that US political prisoner, Mumia
Abu-Jamal, had indeed murdered Philadelphia police officer Daniel
Faulkner, and thus deserved a state-administered death sentence. The
students came to these conclusions themselves, after reviewing all
available evidence under the guidance of a progressive teacher. If HRE
was about evaluating who does and doesn't deserve state violence, then I
wanted nothing to do with it. Admittedly, I was pretty darn ignorant of
the scope of human rights activism. Plus, my feel for political change
was fairly parochial. I needed this book. I needed to [see the strategic
value of human rights in anti-colonial movements, the synergy between
transnational and local human rights activism, and the ways queer
people, people of color, and stateless people instrumentalize while
transgressing the limits of the UDHR.]{.underline} One such person was
El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, commonly known as Malcolm X. [America is a
colonial power . . . depriving us of first-class citizenship, actually
by depriving us of human rights. **She has not only deprived us of the
right to be a citizen, she has deprived us of the right to be human
beings**]{.underline}, the right to be recognized and respected as and
men and women. (Malcolm X, 1964a, pp. 50--51). [Human rights for Malcolm
X was a political strategy that went beyond the US nation-state, and
thus beyond the ways in which civil rights legislation had limited Black
dreams for freedom into a promise of someday equality with whites, or
more precisely limited Black dreams into the fantasy of a someday white
status. \[W\]e are the victims of America's colonialism or American
imperialism]{.underline} . . **[. \[O\]ur problem is not an American
problem; it's a human problem]{.underline}**. It's not a Negro problem;
it's a problem of humanity. [Not just in this life but in our past life.
It's not a problem of civil rights but a problem of human
rights]{.underline}. (Malcolm X, 1964c, para. 1) Malcolm X said [our
present local struggle was transnationally and transhistorically
signific]{.underline}ant -- not just this life but in our past life.
Furthermore, **[colonialism/empire is the transnational and
transhistorical problem that connects the Black struggle in America to
struggles in other places and other times]{.underline}**. For me,
Malcolm X provided a shared vocabulary for these struggles: human
rights, colonialism, empire.

In May 2005, with more than 100,000 U.S. troops at war in Iraq as they
sought to enforce the U.S. military occupation of that oil-rich nation,
and with confrontations growing over North Korean and Iranian nuclear
programs, the Washington Post carried a disturbing report about U.S.
preparations for its next war. In response to Secretary of Defense
Donald Rumsfeld's top secret "Interim Global Strike Alert Order," the
Pentagon's Strategic Command had, it was reported, developed a
"fullspectrum global strike \... capability to deliver rapid, extended
range precision kinetic (nuclear and conventional) and non-kinetic
(elements of space and information operations) effects in support of
theater and national objectives" (Arkin 2005). In plain English, this
meant that [even as U.S. forces were bogged down in Iraq,]{.underline}
[the Pentagon claimed to have established the ability to launch
offensive military attacks -- "conventional" or nuclear -- "in any dark
corner of the world" including North Korea, Iran, or China "at any
moment's notice."]{.underline} "**[American imperial
power,"]{.underline}** former National Security Adviser Zbigniew
Brzezinski once wrote, **[derives "in large measure from superior
organization, from the ability to mobilize vast economic and
technological resources promptly for military purposes"]{.underline}**
(Brzezinski 1998). [Like the wars the United States has fought to create
and then to maintain its global and regional hegemonies]{.underline},
from World War II and the Bushes' Iraq wars, to Vietnam, Nicaragua, and
Kosovo, **[the Pentagon's twenty-first century "global strike" doctrine
depends on the organization of military violence supported by a
historically unprecedented U.S. global infrastructure of foreign
military bases.]{.underline}** [Without its foreign fortresses, the
United States could not have been an "Asian power," or established
hegemony in the Middle East]{.underline} -- "**[the jugular vein" of
global capitalism]{.underline}**. If U.S. military forces had not
guaranteed the survival of the Saudi monarchy, and maintained bases near
Mecca and Medina, cities revered by Moslems, the world might never have
heard of Osama Bin Laden. September 11 might still be remembered as the
day Chilean president Salvador Allende was overthrown and died in
General Pinochet's CIA-backed coup d'état. Similarly, the Monroe
Doctrine that declares all of Latin America and the Caribbean to be
within the U.S. "sphere of interest" could not have been enforced
without repeated invasions and other acts of subversion over almost two
centuries. Even as it suffers setbacks in the Middle East and Central
Asia, [the U.S. goal is to colonize time as well as space in order to
guarantee U.S. military, economic, and political dominance for the
century to come**. This military colonialism claims its tolls of human
lives and hopes, the environment, sovereignty, and national independence
even without shots being fired, missiles launched, or countries
invaded.**]{.underline} More than 200 years ago the U.S. Declaration of
Independence decried the "abuses and usurpations" caused by the
"Standing Armies" that King George III "kept among us, in times of
peace." [Today]{.underline} [the "abuses and usurpations" are far more
intrusive and destructive than those that fueled the U.S. war of
independence. They include more than rape, murder, sexual harassment,
robbery, other common crimes, seizure of people's lands, destruction of
property, and the cultural imperialism that have accompanied foreign
armies since time immemorial.]{.underline} [They now include terrorizing
jet blasts of frequent low altitude and night-landing exercises,
helicopters and warplanes crashing into homes and schools, and the
poisoning of environments and communities with military toxics; and they
transform "host" communities into targets for genocidal nuclear as well
as for "conventional" attacks.]{.underline}

#### US preferential treatment of Israel for arms sales solidifies Israeli settler colonialism towards Palestinian people

The Trump administration seems to care very little about international
consensus and international law on the status of the occupied
territories. Instead, it has sabotaged the American government's
standing as an "honest broker" and effectively encouraged support for
the continuation of Israeli colonization of Arab land. Until now, no
country had recognized Israel's act of plunder in the Golan Heights.
Following the Six Day war in 1967, Israel expelled 130,000 Syrians from
the Golan Heights. 14 years later, in 1981, Israel annexed the territory
-- in violation of international law. The United Nations member states,
including the U.S., immediately declared Israeli efforts to change the
Golan Height's status "null and void." A small population of Syrian
Druze are the only survivors of that ethnic cleansing operation.
[We]{.underline} recently [saw this unfold when Trump issued his
Jerusalem decree to recognize the city as the Israeli capital, which
goes against the international community's consensus of Jerusalem as a
final status issue in negotiations and,]{.underline} again, [violates
international law. While the U.S. Embassy was moving from Tel Aviv to
Jerusalem on May 15, Israeli snipers were massacring 60 Palestinians
protesters in the Great March of Return at the Gaza fence. This is not
the first time we have seen U.S. foreign policy and Israeli
settler-colonial enterprise interfered with the international
community's consensus on Palestinian-Israeli affairs]{.underline}. [The
Jerusalem Basic Law of 1980 and the Jerusalem Embassy Act of
1995]{.underline} were highly controversial because of their timing and
their political and legal implications, according to Michael Zank, a
professor at Boston University. Both laws [were enacted during times
when the international coalition was making progress with the
Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations.]{.underline} U.S. President
[Jimmy Carter and Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat had signed the Camp
David Accords]{.underline}, a peace treaty with Israel and Egypt in
1979; consequently, the Jerusalem Basic Law endangered the peace process
and negatively impacted the ongoing negotiations. The Jerusalem Embassy
Act was signed into law shortly after the Oslo Accords were concluded
and greatly affected the final status negotiations between Israel and
the Palestinian Authority that were held at Camp David in 2000. Both
these legislative acts created a binding relationship between Israel and
the U.S which ultimately changed the status quo. But [to fully
conceptualize the U.S.-Israel special relationship]{.underline} **[we
need to unpack the the preferential arms trade agreements that allows
for this relationship to continue at the expense of the indigenous
population in the occupied territories.]{.underline}** Max Ajl, a PhD
candidate in development sociology at Cornell University, writes: "[U.S.
'military assistance,]{.underline}' more accurately understood as a
circular flow through which U.S. weapons firms profit off the
colonization of Palestinian land and Israeli destabilization of the
surrounding states, [is a long-term structuring element of the
U.S.-Israel 'special relationship.'"]{.underline} U.S. military loans
started arriving in Israel in November 1971, when the Nixon
administration signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Israel to build
up its domestic industrial-arms sector through technical and
manufacturing assistance. Grants started to replace loans in 1974. The
U.S. government shortly afterwards started to permit Israel to spend 26%
of the annual military grant on purchases in Israel -- a unique
arrangement, since by U.S. law recipient countries must spend all of
their foreign military financing in the U.S. According to Ajl, "the
Israeli military industry often relies on U.S. technological inputs, and
the U.S. forbids Israel from manufacturing crucial heavy weaponry, such
as fighter jets, in order to maintain control over Israel." U.S.
military grants to Israel were often quid pro quo, as Israel
increasingly took on the work for which the U.S. could not publicly take
responsibility, given popular unease in the States over aid to fascist
dictatorships. As the International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network noted in
their report, Israel's Worldwide Role in Repression, in the 1970s[,
Israel armed the brutal military regime of the Argentinian junta **that
imposed seven years of state terrorism on the population.**]{.underline}
Israel also provided most of the arms that Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio
"Tachito" Somoza used in the last year of his dictatorship to oppose the
revolution, a conflict that killed tens of thousands of Nicaraguans in
the 1970s. By the 2000s, [the Israeli military-industrial complex had
produced an industry capable of competing in small-arms and high-end
security technology on a worldwide scale]{.underline}. **[Israel started
to export arms that have been refined through high-technology colonial
policing of the Palestinian population]{.underline}**, especially in the
Gaza Strip and the West Bank. In recent years, Israel has risen to one
of the top 10 arms exporters in the world. Last May Haaretz reported,
"Israel's defense-related exports in 2017 totalled \$9.2 billion, an
all-time record and whooping 40% increase over 2016 -- when
defense-related transactions totaled \$6.5 billion." The Obama
administration adjustments to Israel's military aid package came amidst
a shifting geopolitical environment, both within the U.S. and Israel.
There was a shift in original MOU that would slowly phase out the
provisions through which Israel could spend up to 26% of its funding
package within Israel, to Israel spending more of this funding on the
advanced military capabilities that only the United States can provide
-- as much as \$1.2 billion per year, according to Ajl. In addition,
this MOU locked in \$500 million annually for missile defense. The MOU
mandates Israel update its fighter aircraft fleet, which is a direct
investment into the U.S. military-industrial complex, given that
fighter-jet factories are exclusively based in the United States. [**Not
only does U.S. foreign policy and Israeli-settler colonialism shape what
happens across historic Palestine, it also shapes what happens across
the Middle East region.** The firm establishment of Israel's military
defense industry also provides an excuse to sell ever-more-sophisticated
weapons to other regional U.S. allies,]{.underline} especially Saudi
Arabia. [As long as Israel has the latest U.S. technology, other
countries can buy older models]{.underline}, again to the great profit
of the U.S. defense industry. **[Israel thus is the spark plug for an
entire region-wide weapons bazaar]{.underline}**, [while also providing
such countries the means to destroy and dismantle even poorer countries
like Yemen.]{.underline} This keeps the entire region aflame, oppressed
and desperate, and thus unlikely to upset hierarchical regional and
international social structures. Ajl suggests that [one of reasons the
United States]{.underline} [pushed through this MOU]{.underline} before
Obama left office **[is the rising discontent within the U.S. population
over ongoing support for Israeli colonization of historic Palestine and
the surrounding region.]{.underline}** Frida Berrigan, author of Made in
the U.S.A.: American Military Aid to Israel, writes that a major barrier
to any shift in American policy towards Palestine-Israel is "financial
pressures from a U.S military industrial complex accustomed to billions
of dollars in sales to Israel and other Middle Eastern nations locked in
a seemingly perpetual arms race with each other by all buying American
and using Foreign Military Financing (FMF) to pay the bills." The United
States is the primary source of Israel's far superior arsenal. Israel's
dependence on the U.S. for aid and arms means that the Israeli military
relies on spare parts and technical assistance from the U.S. to maintain
optimum performance in battle. During the Bush administration, from 2001
to 2005, Israel had actually received more in U.S. military aid than it
has in U.S. arms deliveries. Over this time period, Israel received
\$10.5 billion in FMF -- the Pentagon's biggest military aid program --
and \$6.3 billion in U.S. arms deliveries. According to Berrigan, the
most prominent of those deals was a \$4.5 billion sale of 102 Lockheed
Martin F-16s to Israel. Unlike other countries, Israel receives its
Economic Support Funds in one lump sum early in the fiscal year rather
than in four quarterly installments. While other countries primarily
deal with the Department of Defense when arranging to purchase military
hardware from U.S. companies, Israel deals directly with U.S. companies
for the vast majority of its military purchases in the United States.
Other countries have a \$100,000 minimum purchase amount per contract,
but Israel is allowed to purchase military items for far less, according
to Berrigan. Today, Israel has been the beneficiary of approximately
\$125 billion in U.S. aid. An unimaginable sum, more than any other
country since World War II. U.S. aid is projected to further increase to
\$165 billion by the end of the new 10-year package, in 2029, according
to Charles D. Freilich, a former Israeli deputy national security
adviser. U.S. aid constitutes some 3% of Israel's total state budget and
about 1% of its GDP, a highly significant sum. Moreover, U.S. aid
constitutes some 20% of the total defense budget, 40% of the budget of
the Israel Defense Forces, and almost the entire procurement budget,
according to Freilich. [Israel's dependence on the U.S. is not limited
to financial aid and weapons sales]{.underline}. According to Freilich[,
the U.S. provides technologies for the development of unique weapons
systems that Israel needs, such as the Iron Dome and the Arrow rocket
and missile defense systems.]{.underline} It [mans the radar deployed in
Israel, which is linked to the global American satellite
system.]{.underline} Fredilich writes, "There is simply no alternative
to American weapons, and our dependence on the United States is almost
complete; the bitter truth is that without the United States, the IDF
would be an empty shell." The United States is Israel's largest trading
partner, at least partially due to their bilateral free trade agreement,
the first the United States signed with any country. [**The U.S.-Israel
special relationship is rooted in preferential arms trade agreements as
a way to subsidize the U.S. military industry and reinforce support for
Israeli colonialism**. This special relationship is locked into an arms
trade cycle where both the Israeli and American elite class
benefits]{.underline}, **[at the expense of the indigenous
population.]{.underline}** The U.S. [recognition of Israeli sovereignty
over occupied territories provides a boost for Israeli
colonialism]{.underline}. We must ask ourselves[, "If Trump has
consented to Israeli illegal seizure of the Golan Heights and Jerusalem,
why not also the West Bank?"]{.underline} Prime Minister [Netanyahu has
vowed to annex Israeli settlements in the West Bank]{.underline} if he
is re-elected, [which wil]{.underline}l [likely be considered as the
final blow to the so called possibility of a two-state
solution.]{.underline} The Trump administration is expected to announce
his "ultimate deal" following the Israeli elections and after a new
government is formed. [It is only a matter of time till the Trump
administration decides to follow suit and recognize Israeli sovereignty
over the West Bank, which will drive the final nail into the coffin of
the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations and solidify Israeli
apartheid.]{.underline}

In the wake of U.S. President Donald [Trump's recognition of Israeli
sovereignty over the Syrian Golan Heights,]{.underline} we are seeing a
continuation of the Trump's administration's flat-out rejection of
international law on the status of occupied territories held by Israel
since 1967. The timing is significant because it is an attempt by Trump
to meddle in the Israeli elections on April 9 which ultimately could
benefit Benjamin Netanyahu's chances for re-election. The Trump
administration seems to care very little about international consensus
and international law on the status of the occupied territories.

capital,]{.underline} which goes against the international community's
consensus of Jerusalem as a final status issue in negotiations and,
again, violates international law. [While the U.S. Embassy was moving
from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem on May 15, Israeli snipers were massacring 60
Palestinians protesters in the Great March of Return at the Gaza
fence**. This is not the first time we have seen U.S. foreign policy and
Israeli settler-colonial enterprise interfered with the international
community's consensus on Palestinian-Israeli affairs**. The Jerusalem
Basic Law of 1980 and the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 were highly
controversial]{.underline} because of their timing and their political
and legal implications, according to Michael Zank, a professor at Boston
University. Both laws were enacted during times when the international
coalition was making progress with the Palestinian-Israeli peace
negotiations. U.S. President Jimmy Carter and Egyptian President Anwar
al-Sadat had signed the Camp David Accords, a peace treaty with Israel
and Egypt in 1979; consequently, the Jerusalem Basic Law endangered the
peace process and negatively impacted the ongoing negotiations. The
Jerusalem Embassy Act was signed into law shortly after the Oslo Accords
were concluded and greatly affected the final status negotiations
between Israel and the Palestinian Authority that were held at Camp
David in 2000. Both these legislative acts created a binding
relationship between Israel and the U.S which ultimately changed the
status quo. **[But to fully conceptualize the U.S.-Israel special
relationship we need to unpack the the preferential arms trade
agreements that allows for this relationship to continue at the expense
of the indigenous population in the occupied territories]{.underline}**.
Max Ajl, a PhD candidate in development sociology at Cornell University,
writes: "[U.S. 'military assistance,' more accurately understood as a
circular flow through which **U.S. weapons firms profit off the
colonization of Palestinian land and Israeli destabilization of the
surrounding states,** is a long-term structuring element of the
U.S.-Israel 'special relationship]{.underline}.'" U.S. military loans
started arriving in Israel in November 1971, when the Nixon
administration signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Israel to build
up its domestic industrial-arms sector through technical and
manufacturing assistance. Grants started to replace loans in 1974. The
U.S. government shortly afterwards started to permit Israel to spend 26%
of the annual military grant on purchases in Israel -- a unique
arrangement, since by U.S. law recipient countries must spend all of
their foreign military financing in the U.S. According to Ajl, "the
Israeli military industry often relies on U.S. technological inputs, and
the U.S. forbids Israel from manufacturing crucial heavy weaponry, such
as fighter jets, in order to maintain control over Israel." U.S.
military grants to Israel were often quid pro quo, as Israel
increasingly took on the work for which the U.S. could not publicly take
responsibility, given popular unease in the States over aid to fascist
dictatorships. As the International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network noted in
their report, Israel's Worldwide Role in Repression, in the 1970s,
Israel armed the brutal military regime of the Argentinian junta that
imposed seven years of state terrorism on the population. Israel also
provided most of the arms that Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio "Tachito"
Somoza used in the last year of his dictatorship to oppose the
revolution, a conflict that killed tens of thousands of Nicaraguans in
the 1970s. By the 2000s, the Israeli military-industrial complex had
produced an industry capable of competing in small-arms and high-end
security technology on a worldwide scale. Israel started to export arms
that have been refined through high-technology colonial policing of the
Palestinian population, especially in the Gaza Strip and the West
Bank[.]{.underline} In recent years, Israel has risen to one of the top
10 arms exporters in the world. Last May Haaretz reported, "Israel's
defense-related exports in 2017 totalled \$9.2 billion, an all-time
record and whooping 40% increase over 2016 -- when defense-related
transactions totaled \$6.5 billion." The Obama administration
adjustments to Israel's military aid package came amidst a shifting
geopolitical environment, both within the U.S. and Israel. There was a
shift in original MOU that would slowly phase out the provisions through
which Israel could spend up to 26% of its funding package within Israel,
to Israel spending more of this funding on the advanced military
capabilities that only the United States can provide -- as much as \$1.2
billion per year, according to Ajl. In addition, this MOU locked in
\$500 million annually for missile defense.The MOU mandates Israel
update its fighter aircraft fleet, which is a direct investment into the
U.S. military-industrial complex, given that fighter-jet factories are
exclusively based in the United States[. Not only does U.S. foreign
policy and Israeli-settler colonialism shape what happens across
historic Palestine, it also shapes what happens across the Middle East
region. The firm establishment of Israel's military defense industry
also provides an excuse to sell ever-more-sophisticated weapons to other
regional U.S. allies, especially Saudi Arabia. As long as Israel has the
latest U.S. technology, other countries can buy older models, again to
the great profit of the U.S. defense industry. Israel thus is the spark
plug for an entire region-wide weapons bazaar, while also providing such
countries the means to destroy and dismantle even poorer countries like
Yemen. **This keeps the entire region aflame, oppressed and desperate,
and thus unlikely to upset hierarchical regional and international
social structures**]{.underline}. Ajl suggests that one of reasons the
United States pushed through this MOU before Obama left office is the
rising discontent within the U.S. population over ongoing support for
Israeli colonization of historic Palestine and the surrounding region.
Frida Berrigan, author of Made in the U.S.A.: American Military Aid to
Israel, writes that a major barrier to any shift in American policy
towards Palestine-Israel is "financial pressures from a U.S military
industrial complex accustomed to billions of dollars in sales to Israel
and other Middle Eastern nations locked in a seemingly perpetual arms
race with each other by all buying American and using Foreign Military
Financing (FMF) to pay the bills." The United States is the primary
source of Israel's far superior arsenal. Israel's dependence on the U.S.
for aid and arms means that the Israeli military relies on spare parts
and technical assistance from the U.S. to maintain optimum performance
in battle. During the Bush administration, from 2001 to 2005, Israel had
actually received more in U.S. military aid than it has in U.S. arms
deliveries. Over this time period, Israel received \$10.5 billion in FMF
-- the Pentagon's biggest military aid program -- and \$6.3 billion in
U.S. arms deliveries. According to Berrigan, the most prominent of those
deals was a \$4.5 billion sale of 102 Lockheed Martin F-16s to Israel.
Unlike other countries, Israel receives its Economic Support Funds in
one lump sum early in the fiscal year rather than in four quarterly
installments. While other countries primarily deal with the Department
of Defense when arranging to purchase military hardware from U.S.
companies, Israel deals directly with U.S. companies for the vast
majority of its military purchases in the United States. Other countries
have a \$100,000 minimum purchase amount per contract, but Israel is
allowed to purchase military items for far less, according to Berrigan.
Today, Israel has been the beneficiary of approximately \$125 billion in
U.S. aid. An unimaginable sum, more than any other country since World
War II. U.S. aid is projected to further increase to \$165 billion by
the end of the new 10-year package, in 2029, according to Charles D.
Freilich, a former Israeli deputy national security adviser. U.S. aid
constitutes some 3% of Israel's total state budget and about 1% of its
GDP, a highly significant sum. Moreover, U.S. aid constitutes some 20%
of the total defense budget, 40% of the budget of the Israel Defense
Forces, and almost the entire procurement budget, according to Freilich.
Israel's dependence on the U.S. is not limited to financial aid and
weapons sales. According to Freilich, the U.S. provides technologies for
the development of unique weapons systems that Israel needs, such as the
Iron Dome and the Arrow rocket and missile defense systems. It mans the
radar deployed in Israel, which is linked to the global American
satellite system. Fredilich writes, "[There is simply no alternative to
American weapons, and our dependence on the United States is almost
complete; the bitter truth is that without the United States, the IDF
would be an empty shell."]{.underline} The United States is Israel's
largest trading partner, at least partially due to their bilateral free
trade agreement, the first the United States signed with any country.
[The U.S.-Israel special relationship is rooted in preferential arms
trade agreements as a way to subsidize the U.S. military industry and
reinforce support for Israeli colonialism. This special relationship is
locked into an arms trade cycle where both the Israeli and American
elite class benefits, at the expense of the indigenous
population]{.underline}. The U.S. recognition of Israeli sovereignty
over occupied territories provides a boost for Israeli colonialism. We
must ask ourselves, "If Trump has consented to Israeli illegal seizure
of the Golan Heights and Jerusalem, why not also the West Bank?" Prime
Minister Netanyahu has vowed to annex Israeli settlements in the West
Bank if he is re-elected, which will likely be considered as the final
blow to the so called possibility of a two-state solution. The Trump
administration is expected to announce his "ultimate deal" following the
Israeli elections and after a new government is formed. It is only a
matter of time till the Trump administration decides to follow suit and
recognize Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank, which will drive the
final nail into the coffin of the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations
and solidify Israeli apartheid.

[Israel's spatial policy]{.underline}, reflective of the settler
colonial context, [nationalized the spatial rights of indigenous 'enemy'
populations. It also allocated limited spatial rights, as part of what
we term 'selective privatization]{.underline},' [a system whereby the
allo- cation of limited spatial rights is determined by weighing
nationality, ethnicity and various other nationalist
considerations]{.underline}, [such as the Judaization of
space]{.underline}, [the interest to increase the number of Jews in
'frontier' regions]{.underline} (these processes were duplicated in 1967
in the occupied territories), [and the desire to inhibit the development
of Arab space]{.underline} (Yiftachel, 2006; Tzfadia & Yacobi, 2011;
Yacobi, 2009; Benvenisti, 2000). Selective privatization stratifies
society according to 6 H. YACOBI AND E. TZFADIA each group's relative
spatial rights. At the same time, [space becomes a reflec- tion of each
group's position in the social hierarchy]{.underline}. [This structure
is not based on a dichotomy between the dominant settler community and
the indigenous population but rather on the complex hierarchy within the
dominant national- ity]{.underline}: [a hierarchy determined by stigmas
of ethnicity, political status and level of 'commitment' to the
nation.]{.underline} Within this complex structure, [space can also
serve as at tool with which to put populations at a disadvantage, such
as newly immi- grated Jews]{.underline}, provided they take part in
strengthening the state's and nation's control over that space (Tzfadia
& Yacobi, 2011[). This selective privatization was part and parcel of a
wider national perspec- tive that viewed the selective privatization of
rights as a means with which to strengthen the state's control of
space]{.underline} -- [provided that substantial spatial rights were
given exclusively to social elites of the dominant (Jewish) nationality
upon joining frontier settlements]{.underline} (Tzfadia, 2009;
Trachtenberg et al., 2016). On a lower standing stood Jewish immigrants,
whose mere presence in nationally signifi- cant space increased national
control, even though they did not belong to the social and political
elite[. These immigrants improved their rights by becoming settlers in
frontiers areas]{.underline}, including in the 'new frontiers' in the
territories occu- pied in 1967 (Newman, 2005[). Palestinian who were
citizens of Israel]{.underline} (and obvi- ously the Palestinian
non-citizens residing in the 1967 occupied territories) **[were excluded
almost entirely from these privatization processes and were primarily
subjected to nationalization,]{.underline}** i.e., their lands were
expropriated. In the 1970s, however, [the nationalization of
Palestinian-owned lands slowed down considerably, stalling altogether
after the 1976 mass protests by the Arab population against land
expropriation]{.underline}, known as the Land Day Protests
(Holzman-Gazit, 2007). Yet, the policy of not allocating public land for
Palestinian usage continued. The fervour for expropriating Palestinian
lands and allocat- ing them to Jewish purposes and to creating a Jewish
settlement system was transferred in 1967 to the occupied territories
(for a detailed discussion, see Weizman, 2007; Newman, 2005). [The above
paints a complex picture of Israel's spatial policy in the first three
decades of its independence]{.underline} -- and up to the present day in
the occupied terri- tories. On the one hand, spatial policy was based on
large-scale nationalization of lands and planning rights. On the other
hand**[, allocating spatial rights to different groups marked a course
of selective privatization, that is, an unequal allocation of partial
spatial rights based on each group's affinity to the main- stream and
its level of commitment to the national effort of gaining Jewish control
over the land.]{.underline}** In other words, while the transfer of
partial rights could be described in terms of privatization, [its main
purpose,]{.underline} as we demonstrate, **[was in fact to reinforce the
exclusive control of Jews over the territory.]{.underline}** With
neoliberalism taking root in Israel (Ram, 2013), the 1980s were marked
by a shrinking welfare state, which greatly affected the level of
government fund allocation to public housing and farming subsidies. The
arrival of one million emigrants from the former Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics ('former Soviet Union' hereinafter) further
aggravated the housing crisis. [It was at this time that the geography
of colonization shifted]{.underline} -- **[the settlement project moved
to the occupied territories]{.underline}** (Newman, 2005[) while
traditional frontiers became peripheries]{.underline} (Tzfadia & Yacobi,
2011; Yacobi, 2009). As a result, [the early 1990s saw deeper changes in
Israel's spatial policy, manifested in two interlinked avenues: property
rights and development rights]{.underline}. We claim that [both avenues
were affected by ideas affiliated with neoliberalism and NPM, as well as
by con- flicts between interest groups]{.underline} − NGOs, politicians
and bureaucrats − [concerning efficiency, distributional justice,
environmentalism and nationalism]{.underline}. [These conflicts are
typical of neo-settler colonialism]{.underline} [because they are
encapsulated in the policy orientation of neoliberalism]{.underline} and
NPM, on the one hand, [and the socio-geographical structure of
settler-colonialism]{.underline}, on the other hand. Publ[ic
participation and collaborative governance were enrooted in Israel's new
spatial policy]{.underline}. The new policies, reforms and proposals
were debated in the media, courts and Parliament assemblies and
committees, as well as new media and in interactions between
organizations. All the materials, proposals, protocols and decisions
were available on the Internet -- on Parliament and ministry websites,
online newspapers, and professional databases. It should be noted that
though as members of Bimkom: Planners for Planning Rights 'Bimkom', a
human rights organization that participated in discussions on Israel's
new spatial policy as part of an ad hoc coalition of NGOs, we were
granted access to data on planning rights, the interpretative analysis
hereunder does not represent Bimkom's values and position; our research
method is based on the mapping of social, organizational and interest
groups, thematic analysis of their positions, and interpretative
analysis of their themes (for more details, see Scollon, 1998).

[The prescription for decolonization]{.underline} -- that is, a
normative project committed to the liberation of the colonized and the
overturning of colonial relationships of power (Kohn and McBride, 2011:
3) -- [is]{.underline} indeed [one of the most counter-hegemonic
implications of the settler colonial paradigm as applied to
Israel-Palestine, potentially shifting it from a diagnostic frame to a
prognostic one which offers a 'proposed solution to the problem, or at
least a plan of attack']{.underline} (Benford and Snow, 2000: 616).
What, however, does the settler colonial paradigm offer by way of
envisioning decolonization? As Veracini (2007) notes, while settler
colonial studies scholars have sought to address the lack of attention
paid to the experiences of indigenous peoples in conventional
historiographical accounts of decolonization (which have mostly focused
on settler independence and the loosening of ties to the 'motherland'),
there is nevertheless a 'narrative deficit' when it comes to imagining
settler decolonization. While Veracini (2007) relates this deficit to a
matter of conceptualization, [it is apparent that the structural
perspective of the paradigm in many ways closes down possibilities of
imagining the type of social and political transformation to which the
notion of decolonization aspires.]{.underline} In this regard, [there is
a worrying tendency]{.underline} (if not tautological discrepancy) [in
settler colonial studies, where **the only solution to settler
colonialism is decolonization -- which a faithful adherence to the
paradigm renders largely unachievable, if not impossible.**]{.underline}
To understand why this is the case, it is necessary to return to Wolfe's
(2013a: 257) account of settler colonialism as guided by a 'zero-sum
logic whereby settler societies, for all their internal complexities,
uniformly require the elimination of Native alternatives'. The
structuralism of this account has immense power as a means of mapping
forms of injustice and indignity as well as strategies of resistance and
refusal, and Wolfe is careful to show how transmutations of the logic of
elimination are complex, variable, discontinuous and uneven. Yet, [in
seeking to elucidate the logic of elimination as the overarching
historical force guiding settlernative relations there is an operational
weakness in the theory, whereby **such a logic is**]{.underline} simply
there, [**omnipresent and manifest even when**]{.underline} (and perhaps
especially when) **[it appears not to be]{.underline}**; the settler
colonial studies scholar need only read it into a situation or context.
It thus hurtles from the past to the present into the future, never to
be fully extinguished until the native is, or until history itself ends.
There is thus a powerful ontological (if not metaphysical) dimension to
Wolfe's account, where there is such thing as a 'settler will' that
inherently desires the elimination of the native and the distinction
between the settler and the native can only ever be categorical, founded
as it is on the 'primal binarism of the frontier' (2013a: 258). It is
here that the differences between earlier settler colonial scholarship
on Israel-Palestine and the recent settler colonial turn come into
clearest view. While Jamal Hilal's (1976) Marxist account of the
conflict, for instance, engaged Palestinians and Jewish Israelis in
terms of their relations to the means of production, Wolfe's account
brings its own ontology: the bourgeoisie/proletariat distinction becomes
that of settler/native, and the class struggle the struggle between
settler, who seeks to destroy and replace the native, and native, who
can only ever push back. Indeed, if the settler colonial paradigm views
history in similar teleological terms to the Marxist framework, it does
not offer the same hopeful vision of a liberated future. After all,
settler colonialism has only one story to tell -- 'either total victory
or total failure' (Veracini, 2007). Veracini's attempt to disaggregate
different forms of settler decolonization is revealing of the
difficulties that come along with this zero-sum perspective. It is
significant to note that beyond settler evacuation (which may decolonize
territory, he cautions, but not necessarily relationships) the picture
he paints is a relatively bleak one. For Veracini (2011: 5), [claims for
decolonization from indigenous peoples in settler societies can take two
broad forms: an 'anti-colonial rhetoric expressing a demand for
indigenous sovereign independence and self-determination]{.underline}
\... [and an ''ultra''-colonial one that seeks a reconstituted
partnership with the \[settler state\] and advocates a return to a
relatively more respectful middle ground and ''treaty''
conditions'.]{.underline} While both, he suggests, are tempting
strategies in the struggle for change, though 'ultimately ineffective
against settler colonial structures of domination' (2011: 5), it is the
latter strategy that invites Veracini's most scathing assessment. As he
writes, under settler colonial conditions the independent polity is the
settler polity and sanctioning the equal rights of indigenous peoples
has historically been used as a powerful weapon in the denial of
indigenous entitlement and in the enactment of various forms of coercive
assimilation. This decolonisation actually enhances the subjection of
indigenous peoples\... it is at best irrelevant and at worst detrimental
to indigenous peoples in settler societies. (2011: 6--7) The 'primal
binarism of the frontier' plays a particularly ambivalent role in
Veracini's (2011: 6) formulation, where the categorical distinction
between settler and native obstructs the 'possibility of a genuinely
decolonized relationship' (by virtue of its lopsidedness) yet [is **a
necessary political strategy to guard against the absorption of
indigenous people into the settler fold**, which would represent settler
colonialism's final victory.]{.underline} The battle here is between a
'settler colonialism \[that\] is designed to produce a fundamental
discontinuity as its ''logic of elimination'' runs its course until it
actually extinguishes the settler colonial relation' and an
anti-colonial struggle that 'must aim to keep the settler-indigenous
relationship going' (2011: 7). In other words, [the categorical
distinction produced by the frontier must be maintained in order to
struggle against its effects.]{.underline} Given the lack of options
presented to indigenous peoples by Veracini (2014: 315), his conclusion
that settler decolonization demands a 'radical, post-settler colonial
passage' is perhaps not surprising -- although he has 'no suggestion as
to how this may be achieved and \[is\] pessimistic about its
feasibility'. [Scholars have long reckoned with the ambivalence of the
settler colonial situation, which is simultaneously colonial and
postcolonial, colonizing and decolonizing]{.underline} (Curthoys, 1999:
288). Given the generally dreadful Fourth World circumstances facing
many indigenous peoples in settler societies, it could be argued that
there is good reason for such pessimism. [The settler colonial paradigm,
in this sense, offers an important caution against celebratory
narratives of progress.]{.underline} Wolfe (1994), it must be recalled,
wrote the original articulation of his thesis precisely against the idea
of 'historical rupture' that dominated in Australia postMabo, and was
thus as much a scholarly intervention as it was a political challenge to
the idea of Australia having broken with its colonial past. Nonetheless,
[the fatalism of the settler colonial paradigm -- whereby
**decolonization is by and large put beyond the realms of
possibility**]{.underline} -- has seen it come under considerable
critique for reifying settler colonialism as a transhistorical
meta-structure where colonial relations of domination are inevitable
(Macoun and Strakosch, 2013: 435 ; Snelgrove et al., 2014: 9). **[Not
only does Wolfe's ontology erase contingency, heterogeneity
and]{.underline}** (crucially) **agency** (Merlan, 1997; Rowse, 2014)[,
**but its polarized framework effectively 'puts politics to
death'**]{.underline} (Svirsky, 2014: 327). In response to such
critiques, Wolfe (2013a: 213) suggests that 'the repudiation of
binarism' may just represent a 'settler perspective'. However, as
Elizabeth Povinelli (1997: 22) has astutely shown, it is in this regard
that [the totalizing logic of Wolfe's structure of invasion rests on a
disciplinary gesture where 'any discussion which does not insist on the
polarity of the \[settler\] colonial project' is]{.underline}
assimilationist, worse still, [genocidal in effect if not
intent]{.underline}. Any attempt to 'explore the dialogical or hybrid
nature of colonial subjectivity' -- which would entail working beyond
the bounds of absolute polarity -- is disciplined as complicit in the
settler colonial project itself, [leaving 'the only nonassimilationist
position one that adheres strictly and solely to a critique of
\[settler\] state discourse'. **This gesture not only disallows the
possibility of counter-publics and strategic alliances**]{.underline}
(even limited ones), [**but also comes dangerously close to 'resistance
as acquiescence'** insofar as the settler colonial studies scholar may
malign the structures set in play by settler colonialism, but only from
a safe distance unsullied by the messy ambivalences and contradictions
of settler and native subjectivities and relations.]{.underline}
Opposition is thus left as our only option, but, **[as we know from
critical anti-colonial and postcolonial scholarship, opposition in
itself is not decolonization.]{.underline}**

2016, a video published by Electronic Intifada showed [the apparent
execution of a young Palestinian in occupied East

identified as Muhammad Abu Khalaf from the Jerusalem area town of Kufr
Aqab, was carrying out a stabbing attack on Israeli border police
officers when he was killed at the Damascus Gate of Jerusalem\'s Old
City, the video footage showed that [the young man posed no threat to
anyone and that a border police officer was shooting at the man after he
fell to the ground. Then, several other heavily armed officers shot
dozens of bullets into the man\'s body as he lay on the ground and as
passers-by were hurrying away from the scene.]{.underline} According to
Electronic Intifada, \"the video is [a shocking display of Israel\'s

[Understanding Israel]{.underline} as a racial state [is incomplete
without also theorizing it as a settler-colonial
enterprise]{.underline}. Settler colonialism\'s main objective is not
the enslavement or exploitation of the natives but rather access to
their territory. [Jewish Israeli settler colonialism was moulded not
merely by Zionist ideology but also by the process of colonizing an
already settled territory, a process that inevitably brought about
conflict with the native society]{.underline} (Shafir 1993). Theorizing
Israel\'s conquest of Palestine as settler colonialism is not new and
has its origins in the politics of left-wing groups such as Matzpen (13)
that saw Zionism as an imperial enterprise (Ram 1993) and in the work of
the Israeli sociologist Baruch Kimmerling (1983) who theorized Zionism
as a colonizatory movement that aimed to control the territory of
Palestine, thbrough what Pappe (2006) calls \"[the ethnic cleansing of
Palestine]{.underline}\". Kimmerling highlights the centrality of the
Zionist labour movement in the colonization of Palestine as resulting
from [the imperative to settle the frontier]{.underline}. Likewise,
Shafir (1989) argues that [the Jewish settlement of Palestine is a
\"pure colony\" based not on enslaved or native labour but rather on the
labour of the settlers who, besides the native territory, also sought to
eliminate the natives from the labour force]{.underline} (Ram 1993: 30).
[Defining Israel as settler colonial goes against Zionism\'s self-image
as a response to European antisemitism that enabled the settlement of
\"people without land in a land without people\".]{.underline} (14) [It
is worth remembering in this regard that Zionism explicitly cast itself
in settler-colonial terms: \"Yishuv\"\--the name of the prestate polity
in Palestine\--literally means \"settlement]{.underline}\". After the
first Zionist Congress of 1897, which voted in favour of Jewish
migration to Palestine, it was explicitly decided to establish \"three
types of colonies in Palestine: kibbutz, moshav and town\" (15)
(Benvenisti 2002: 263). Furthermore, as Wolfe (2006: 388) argues,
settler colonialism is about replacing the natives, unlike colonialism
which is about the exploitation of the natives, and it always replaces
what it destroys[. Thus replacing Palestinian orchards with imported
European conifers (which the Zionists dubbed \"making the desert
bloom\"), depopulated Palestinian villages and urban neighbourhood with
Jewish settlements, roads and national parks, Palestinian place names
with Hebrew place names, and the present-day campaign to replace Bedouin
villages, deemed \"unrecognised\", with Jewish space for, inter alia,
army manoeuvres, are all classic settler-colonial
governmentalities]{.underline}. Settler colonialism is informed by
various interpretations of terra nullius (\"a land without people\") and
\"is an inclusive, land-centred project that coordinates a comprehensive
range of agencies, from the metropolitan centre to the frontier
encampment, with a view to eliminating indigenous societies\" (Wolfe
2006: 393). Analysing Australian, North American and Israeli settler
colonialism, Wolfe argues that settler colonialism is ultimately about a
logic of elimination. Furthermore, [**in Israel biopolitics regulates
and controls the lives of Jews and Palestinians alike, the former
accorded land resources and encouraged to breed and multiply, the
latter\--both citizens and occupied subjects\--deprived of land
resources and of means of sustaining their families**]{.underline}
(through lower allocations of crucial resources, including water, roads,
education, health and other services). Wolfe\'s theorization of settler
colonialism as premised on securing territory in terms of \"structured
genocide\" leads us to appreciating the concrete relationships between
spatial removal, mass killings and biocultural assimilation. [The logic
of elimination is illustrated by the expulsion of the Palestinians from
their lands during and after the 1948 Nakba, by the resettlement of
their villages and urban neighbourhood by Jews, by the 1967 occupation
of the West Bank and Gaza, by the progressive dispensing with
Palestinian workers from the occupied territory]{.underline} (Kemp and
Raijman 2008) [and by the increasing military and civilian control of
the territory. A poignant example is the building of the so-called
\"separation wall\"]{.underline}: As Wolfe (2006) reminds us, [there
could hardly be a more concrete expression of spatial sequestration than
the West Bank barrier \... as Palestinians become more and more
dispensable, Gaza and the West Bank become less and less like Bantustans
and more and more like reservations]{.underline} (or, for that matter,
like the Warsaw Ghetto). (404) Svirsky and Bignall (2012) critique
Agamben, arguing that his project, firmly anchored in Western political
thought, is conceived without reference to colonialism and
anticolonialism, and ignores the critical interventions by colonized
people engaged in acts of decolonization. Wolfe seems to agree. (16) In
theorizing settler colonialism as spearheaded by mavericks who establish
the frontier, taken over by the colonial state once the dust settles on
frontier violence, he also sees the frontier as the classic state of
exception where primordial irregularity helps the sovereign to declare
the rule of law. However, he adds, Agamben\'s (2005) deeply entrenched
eurocentrism prevented him from seeing the colonial context, focusing
instead on the centrality of the paradigm of security in the state of
exception, which uses security as \"the normal technique of government\"
(14). **[Security, discourses of \"existential threat\" and Jewish
victimhood are central to Israel\'s racial policies]{.underline}**. As
[Israel]{.underline} sees itself as a haven for the \"Jewish nation\",
it [regards the control of 1948 Palestinians, 1967 Palestinians and
diasporic Palestinians as an imperative born of necessity and emergency,
which, Agamben suggests, creates and guarantees the situation that the
law needs for its validity.]{.underline} While Agamben does not theorize
colonialism in the context of biopower, [settler colonialism is
intrinsic to biopower, the product and process of a colonial
world]{.underline}. According to Morgensen (2011), [**colonialism and
settler colonialism place indigenous peoples in a state of exception,
albeit one that troubles the territorial and national integrity of
settlers as representatives of Western law**.]{.underline} Morgensen
reminds us, following Wolfe, that [as settler colonials come to stay,
assertions of sovereignty by settlers ground Western law in \"a logic of
elimination\". Indeed, the logic of elimination aims not to destroy but
to produce life, so as to amalgamate Indigenous peoples, cultures and
lands into the body of the settler nation]{.underline} (2011: 56).
[Thus, as Zionist settler colonials stayed and regarded the new colony
as \"their\" land, they had to employ biopolitical strategies,
controlling the life practices of the indigenous Palestinians, so as to
enable the Jewish colonists to live at the expense of the Palestinian
natives. Israel\'s settler-colonial racial regime creates constant zones
of exception, as witnessed inter alia in the 2014 massacre of Gaza,
conceived as exterior to any considerations of humanity or human
rights]{.underline}. A further example of what the African American
journalist and civil rights leader Ida B. Wells (with reference to
lynching) called the seemingly exceptional \"unwritten law\" which
becomes the law (17) is [the military courts system for trying
Palestinians, including many minors, in the occupied territory,
\"operating with virtually no transparency, subject to very lax internal
supervision, and rarely exposed to any public scrutiny]{.underline}\"
(Yesh Din 2013). Another illustration of settler colonialism as a racial
state of exception is the occupation\'s [colonial bureaucracy enacted
every day in every West Bank checkpoint, through sovereignty\--practices
of controlling space through the security forces and
governmentality\--practices of managing populations through
intelligence, economic control and racial profiling]{.underline} (Berda
2012). Settler-colonial practices such as the [periodic lethal attacks
on the besieged Gaza enclave, the disproportionate availability of water
between Jewish settlers and indigenous Palestinians in the OPT, and, of
late, the increased use of administrative detention and the growing
numbers of extrajudicial executions]{.underline} (see
euromedmonitor.org, 2015) [illustrate how biopolitics in the settler
colony that is Palestine becomes one of death]{.underline}, that Mbembe
(2003) calls \"necropolitics\" and Ghanim documents as
\"thanatopolitics\": \"from the moment that power is directed to
destroying, eliminating and dismantling their group, the decision about
their life becomes a decision about their death\" (Ghanim 2008: 69). And
death, expulsion and exclusion become the ultimate way of overcoming
(self-perceived) Israeli Jewish victimhood, which Svirsky theorizes as a
settler-colonial immunitarian practice of segregation and political
conservation of the paradoxical notion of \"Jewish democracy\" against
any possibility of shared ways of life (Svirsky 2012: 58).

#### Status quo theorizations of Israeli settler-colonialism rely on critiques of one or two specific instances -- the aff's critique Israel as a whole uniquely solves.

[In theorizing Israel as a settler-colonial regime, Wolfe positions race
as a trace of colonial history through noting racial hierarchies of
European versus Arab Jews]{.underline}. However, he does not position
race as central to the everyday criminality of the settler-colonial
regime in Palestine, which is what I want to end with. [Analyses
condemning the 1967 Israeli occupation of Palestine do not necessarily
accept as illegal the 1948 occupation of Palestinian lands or the Nakba
which saw the expulsion of some 800,000 Palestinians and the destruction
and depopulation of more than 500 villages and urban neighbourhoods, or
the very occupation itself. With few exceptions, such analyses often
focus on \"Israel\'s refusal to accept the legal obligations that the
status of an occupying power entails]{.underline}\" (Ben-Naftali, Gross
and Michaeli 2005). **[The discourse of obligations as an occupying
power appears to focus on specific actions undertaken within the
occupation rather than on the illegality of the occupation
itself]{.underline}**. As Ben-Naftali, Gross and Michaeli argue, even
[the recent advisory opinion rendered by the International Court of
Justice, Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the
Occupied Palestinian Territory, while critical of both this construction
and the related settlement enterprise, and decreeing their illegality,
still focused on specific actions by Israel without questioning the
legality of the occupation regime itself]{.underline}. (Ben-Naftali,
Gross and Michaeli 2005: 552) Offering an opinion on the legality of the
Israeli occupation of Palestine is beyond my competence. However, [the
recourse to increasingly violent measures by the Israeli security forces
against Palestinians mounting what I consider legitimate resistance
against occupation and siege, including at the extreme end extrajudicial
executions\--with the full support of the political leadership from
Prime Minister Netanyahu downwards and of the military command\--must be
understood not merely in legal but also in racial terms. Following
Israel\'s war against the Palestinians, it has become clear that house
and village demolitions, whether as punishment for alleged wrongdoings,
as deterrence or as population clearance mechanisms]{.underline} (in the
case of demolitions of Bedouin villages, or of expulsions of
Palestinians in the Jordan Valley region), [administrative
detention]{.underline} (used against Palestinian but not against Jewish
\"terrorists\"), [and particularly extrajudicial executions are
performed along racial lines]{.underline}. As Weheliye (2014) argues, if
we follow Ruth Wilson Gilmore\'s definition of racism as not resting on
phenotype or culture, but \"as the state-sanctioned and/or extra-legal
production and exploitation of group-differentiated vulnerabilities to
premature death\", what, then, is racism if not the political
exploitation and (re)production of race? (55) [Palestinians are targeted
by the Israeli settler colony not for phenotypical or cultural
reason]{.underline}s (though the former also pertain, as the Israeli
security forces have been known to target not merely Palestinians but
also, in some cases, \"Arab Looking\" Israeli Jews and, in one notorious
case, an Eritrean asylum seeker, shot by a security guard in Tel Aviv\'s
central bus station and later lynched by an Israeli Jewish mob; Gross
2015), [but for state-sanctioned political ends, the ultimate aim of
which is what Wolfe calls \"the logic of elimination]{.underline}\".
Racism, as Weheliye further argues, is \"[the ordinary means through
which dehumanization achieves ideological normality]{.underline}\". And
since Agamben\'s [homo sacerization goes hand in hand with
racialization]{.underline}\--even if Agamben does not explicitly say
so\--\"homines sacri not only legally and ideologically reside beyond
the scope of the political community \... their alterity is also visibly
marked, rendering the homo sacer\'s ban logical within the constraints
of Man\'s racializing assemblages\" (Weheliye 2014: 72). Just as Jews
were racialized as non-whites/Aryans, so does Israel racialize
Palestinian citizens and occupied, besieged and diasporic Palestinians
as non-Jews/whites while justifying their racialization in terms of
self-defence.

#### Israel is still reformable but pressure is necessary

With this we learn that [rather than demolishing the State of
Israel]{.underline}, Shammas's project, as outlined above, is [instead
to provoke and confront ensconced Jewish control in Israel]{.underline}.
In doing so, Shammas intends [to formulate the parameters of an
identity, accessible to both Palestinian-Arabs and Jews in Israel,
grounded upon state representation, shared territory and genuine
citizenship]{.underline}. Important for our purposes is the familiar
structure of Shammas's [critique of Israeli national
homogeneity]{.underline}. Similar to other prominent Arab and Jewish
intellectuals, the argument contends that **[as a result of the regime's
multifaceted manifestation of Jewish dominance, Palestinian-Arabs in
Israel are denied equal citizenship]{.underline}**. And, as we will see
below, for the most part, [this is where the existing scholarly
literature stops]{.underline}. This chapter begins with an outline of
the effects of the basic and inherent contradictions in the Israeli
incorporation regime through a comparative sample of the notable social
science research conducted on Arabs in Israel and their respective and
various formulations of what Palestinian citizenship entails or lacks.
From here, [the paradigm of stateless citizenship is introduced
alongside the existing scholarship as part of a response to the yet
unanswered question of how Palestinian citizenship came to embody its
existing exclusionary dynamics.]{.underline}

We would argue that the class structure of the United States,
immigration, and racism better explain the situation of the
Mexican-origin population in the United States today, especially in the
Southwest, rather than settler colonialism. [But first, let us briefly
examine more closely the Palestinian issue, which is both different and
in many ways more complex than ours]{.underline}. An accounting and
clearer sense of the current Palestinian issue is urgent, since we, as
Chicanos/as/Latinos/as, as [US citizens and residents, are complicit in
the current destitution, displacement, and even genocide of Palestinians
in view of the fact that]{.underline} \[End Page 1044\] the United
States provides Israel with close to \$3 billion dollars a year of our
tax dollars, much of it in military aid. In the Gaza war of 2008--9
[Israel's use of indiscriminate and intentional force against the
civilian population of Gaza left fourteen hundred Gazans dead, an attack
that the United States supported materially, providing US weapons. The
United States also blocked cease-fire efforts and gave unwavering
diplomatic support to Israel. Bluntly put]{.underline}, to quote the US
linguist Noam Chomsky, "[we are their partners in crime."]{.underline}16
Last year Israel subjected Gaza to eight days of bombardment. As Chomsky
again makes clear, ["The Israeli decision to rain death and destruction
on Gaza, to use lethal weapons of the modern battlefield on a largely
defenseless civilian population is the final phase in a decades-long
campaign to ethnically cleanse Palestinians."]{.underline}17 [Israeli
aggression in Palestine is best comparable with---and has its historical
correlate in---US aggression against its Native American population,
which it decimated throughout the nineteenth century, to dispossess them
of the lands where they lived and worked, and which it continues today
in multiple ways.]{.underline} Israeli aggression in Palestine is
likewise also comparable with US aggression in Afghanistan and Iraq,
against Vietnam, Korea, and Central American countries like Nicaragua
and Guatemala. In this regard it is not quite comparable with US
aggression against the Mexican population in the Southwest, for despite
human losses in the US--Mexican war, casualties in that conflict were
not primarily in the Southwest territory but in central Mexico, although
here in the Southwest, too, occupation and dispossession were the
ultimate objectives. It is precisely [this issue of
dispossession]{.underline} that [is especially striking and
revealing.]{.underline} To highlight the differences between our two
cases, let us return to our 1848/1948 benchmarks to review some further
facts. While [Palestinians were the majority native population in 1948
in the area of Palestine, now controlled by Israel, and had resided
there for centuries]{.underline}, Mexican/Spanish [settlers]{.underline}
were at best a small population, somewhere between seventy thousand and
one hundred thousand in the vast lands of the Southwest, that had
resided somewhere between 77 and 150 years in the Southwest by 1846 and,
more importantly, had themselves [dispossessed and subjugated the Native
American peoples of the area.]{.underline} In what became the US
Southwest, the indigenous population that migrated to the area of the
Americas some twenty-five thousand years ago would be oppressed,
exploited, dispossessed, and eliminated first by the Spanish explorers,
conquerors, and settlers and later by Mexican and Anglo colonists. [What
needs to be stressed is that the indigenous population that resided here
for thousands of years is most comparable to the displaced Palestinian
population]{.underline}.

#### Aff rejects an instance of settler colonialism -- attributing Israel to a settler-state is necessary for the alternative's success.

In some instances, guns are used. These events are always reported in
the Arab media, as well as in the Israeli Hebrew media. Community
leaders and political leaders in the Palestinian community continue to
call upon the state to initiate policies that would address this
problem. To this day, the Israeli state continues to ignore these
calls[. Israeli security forces seem to only focus on the Palestinian
community through the perspective of a security lens, always monitoring
what they call the 'radicalisation' of the Palestinian public. Israeli
security forces only intervene forcefully to suppress political
organising and protests. From the cases discussed here, it appears that
the Israeli state encourages internal divisions, continues to repress
the Palestinian collective identity, and lets conflicts erupt into
violence.]{.underline} On the other hand, some in the Palestinian
community are dealing with this problem through continuing calls on the
state to maintain internal peace and order. At the same time, local
conflict management methods are also used to manage tensions. Many
political parties and organisations also work on education and
mobilisation for unity. [This paper argued that linking the historical
development of 1948 and that of 1967 Palestinians is not only about
countering the rupture that took place in 1948, but could also
illustrate the intentions of the Israeli establishment, and possible
scenarios for the **future. In other words, learning about 1948
Palestinians can tell us more about the history of that community, as
well as highlighting the pattern of relationships the state has
established with the 1967 Palestinians. Failing to focus on the origins
of the state, and on relations between settlers and natives, has led to
a flawed understanding of the Israeli state and its relations to native
Palestinians in the field of Palestine Studies**. By not grounding the
analyses on the origin of the state (at least since 1948), much
scholarly work ends up missing the impact of settler colonial structures
and their ramification for the Palestinians who are citizens of the
state and those who reside in the 1967 Territories**. In some sense,
this work even legitimates the settler colonial structure established in
1948**]{.underline}. By not connecting the scholarship about 1948 and
that of 1967 Palestinians, we fail to recognise a pattern that started
in 1948 and was replicated in 1967[. By studying 1948 Palestinians, we
can better understand the intentions of the Israeli state for the future
of the Palestinians living 122 in the 1967 areas, as well as those in
exile. A state that was established as a setter colonial structure on
the ruins of the native population, cannot allow for coexistence unless
it dismantles a founding ideology and goes through an historical
self-evaluation]{.underline}. This must include the acknowledgement of
past wrongs and a commitment to reparation[. Settler
colonialism,]{.underline} as many theorists have argued, is based on a
genocidal attempt to displace indigenous peoples.22 This produces
endlessly conflicting relations with the native population, and [can
help explaining Israeli policies and positions towards]{.underline} the
1948 [Palestinians,]{.underline} and all Palestinians in general.

The United States was born as a naval trading nation, and, two centuries
before the oil boom, 20 percent of this trade was with the Middle East.
The early American presence in the region was mainly in North Africa,
where trading ships sailed to export American goods and to import
carpets, nuts, and figs; along with these came fashion and even some
architectural ideas. The trade routes to North Africa were also the
hunting ground of Barbary corsairs, and European nations paid these
pirates to protect their traders from attack. Some U.S. officials, such
as Thomas Jefferson, opposed this sort of bribery and insisted that the
United States build a naval force to protect its interest in maritime
freedom. Meanwhile, John Adams spoke for those who preferred payoffs to
building a navy. In the end, the former view prevailed \-- and one of
the arguments for the new U.S. Constitution was that a stronger federal
government was needed to raise funds for just such a naval force. From
that early period until today, [the American presence in the Middle East
has revolved around three themes: faith, fantasy, and
power]{.underline}. [Power \-- whether military, diplomatic, or economic
\-- is the pursuit of tangible American interests in the Middle
East]{.underline}. [This pursuit began right at the creation of the
United States, and the complications associated with such an enterprise
became apparent almost immediately]{.underline}. [The first American
hostage crisis occurred as early as 1787,]{.underline} when more than a
hundred sailors were held captive by Algerian pirates. Meanwhile,
[nearby Morocco was the first foreign country to recognize U.S.
independence in 1777]{.underline}, and one of the first treaties made by
the new U.S. government was with the Bey of Morocco. **[Finding the
right balance between friendly and adversarial power relations with
Middle East players has challenged American leaders ever
since.]{.underline}** The second theme, [faith]{.underline}, **[emerged
from the colonial legacy established by Puritans and other Christians
seeking refuge from religious persecution.]{.underline}** These
[Christians nevertheless wanted to impart their own faith to an
unbelieving world.]{.underline} Generations later, the new United States
viewed itself as a nation created not for its own benefit alone, but for
the benefit of all humanity. [Hence the notion of the \"city on a
hill]{.underline}\" \-- a shining example of freedom, morality, and
human rights for all the world to see. [The founding fathers agreed on
this principle, looking back to the Old Testament and finding a God who
spoke directly to his people, in their own language, promising to rescue
them from exile and restore them to the Holy Land]{.underline}. Quite a
few [religious American settlers appropriated those promises and
considered themselves the \"new Jews.\"]{.underline} Some also believed
that the return of the Jewish people to Palestine would make the country
\"bloom like a rose.\" For example, **[John Adams once wrote that he
wished 100,000 Jewish soldiers would march to Palestine and reclaim it
as a Judean kingdom]{.underline}**. [Similar sentiments found elaborate
expression in the bestselling mid-1800s book Valley of the Vision by
George Bush]{.underline} \-- [ancestor of the two modern-day presidents.
The theme of fantasy became apparent in the illusory and mystical images
of the Middle East engraved in the minds of many Americans]{.underline},
who **[saw it as a realm of unrivaled romance and
exoticism]{.underline}**. [This is the imagined Middle East of the
black-clad nomad with his flowing robe]{.underline}, [galloping out of
the desert on a white steed, picking up some innocent woman and taking
her to his tent. It is the mythical image of the Thousand and One
Nights, of Scheherazade and flying carpets and gleaming
minarets]{.underline}. [From the very early days of the republic,
well-known Americans traveled to the region in search of this
chimera.]{.underline} For example, John Ledgerd, a close friend of
Thomas Jefferson, gave a glimpse in his memoirs of how the Middle East
looked to Americans. Although he was disoriented by locals talking in
strange tongues and astounded by their bizarre ways of dressing, he
found one group of \"natives\" \-- the Bedouin \-- to be very admirable.
To him, they seemed to love liberty as much as Americans did, given
their hatred toward the oppressive hand of the Ottoman Empire. He even
suggested that if a rising power like the United States helped free the
Bedouins from imperial rule, they would become a democratic people. By
the middle of the nineteenth century, [thousands of Americans tourists
were traveling to the Middle East]{.underline}. Herman [Melville was
greatly disappointed]{.underline} \-- as he expounded at length in
voluminous diaries \-- [by the region\'s reality compared to its
imaginary allure]{.underline}. Mark [Twain had a similar reaction, with
almost nothing good to say about either the Middle East or the Americans
he encountered there]{.underline}. **[Faith met fantasy]{.underline}**
\-- and came up short \-- [in Twain\'s travel notes from the
region]{.underline}, published under the title Innocents Abroad. [The
book recounts the tales of \"restorationists\" who went to Palestine as
early as 1818 in order to teach local Jews how to farm.]{.underline}
[Such missionaries also founded colonies in the hope of re-creating a
Jewish state. But Twain found them all perilously close to
ruin.]{.underline} In the twentieth century, [U.S. policy toward the
Middle East often involved the intersection of faith]{.underline}
(whether in a democratic or religious mission) [and power
politics]{.underline}, [with mixed results]{.underline}. During World
War I, Theodore [Roosevelt insisted that the United States would be
disregarding its ideals of democracy and human rights if it did not
declare war on the Ottoman Empire]{.underline} as it had done with the
other two Central Powers. President Woodrow Wilson\'s refusal to do so
was a fateful decision. [When the guns fell silent**, more than one
million troops from Britain and France were stationed in the Middle
East**]{.underline} \-- but not one American soldier. As a result, the
United States had no role in the new Middle East controlled by the
French and the British. At the same time, [Wilson hinted to one
confidant that he relied partly on his Christian faith in endorsing
Britain\'s November 1917 Balfour Declaration]{.underline} \-- which for
the first time put a major power on record in official support of the
Zionist project of establishing a \"Jewish National Home\" in Palestine.
Similarly, [faith in democracy helped move the United States to support
the liberation of the Middle East from British and French colonialism
following World War II.]{.underline} Faith once again trumped power in
1948, when Harry [Truman]{.underline} \-- privately comparing himself to
Cyrus, the Persian emperor who permitted the Jews to return to Judea
from Babylonian exile \-- [took pride in helping to re-create a Jewish
nation **by making the United States the first country to recognize the
state of Israel.**]{.underline} [He did so,]{.underline} however, [only
for these reasons, rather than in response to the
entreaties]{.underline} (which he resented) [of both Jewish lobbyists
and his one lifelong Jewish friend.]{.underline} This illustrates how
[**modern-day U.S. support for Israel is part of a long history of
popular, partly faith-based sympathy for Jewish restoration to the Holy
Land** \-- and of support for the spread of democracy in that
region]{.underline}. This history is almost as long as that of the
United States itself. Today, [many Middle Easterners are unaware of this
history]{.underline}, [not realizing that the United States has long
enjoyed multifaceted and mutually beneficial relations in the
region.]{.underline} Although its policies, perceptions, and motives
have sometimes been a bit muddled, the United States has done vastly
more good than harm in the Middle East over the course of more than two
centuries, in unexpected ways that often foreshadowed some of this
century\'s most complex challenges. In the wake of U.S. President Donald
Trump's recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Syrian Golan
Heights, [we are seeing a continuation of the Trump's administration's
flat-out rejection of international law on the status of occupied
territories held by Israel since 1967]{.underline}. The timing is
significant because it is an attempt by Trump to meddle in the Israeli
elections on April 9 which ultimately could benefit Benjamin Netanyahu's
chances for re-election.

the "Where" of inquiry: Place and Land in Qualitative Research"}//Mberhe

**[Relational validity prioritizes the reality that human life is
connected to and dependent on other species and the land.]{.underline}**
Thus, [relational validity is based on the understanding that the
prioritization of "economic validity" is harmful for people, other forms
of life, and places.]{.underline} While only a few years ago a discourse
of climate change denial was prevalent and growing (Leiserowitz,
Maibach, Roser-Renouf, & Hmielowski, 2012), we have entered a new stage
in which human extinction from the planet is a realistic and very
probable concern (Sarmiento, Sean, Tola, & Hantel, 2014). The economic,
individualist, and anthropocentric paradigm of Western (post)modernism
continues to expand in its current globalizing and neoliberal forms
(Peck, 2013). In its global reach, it binds increasing numbers of
governance practices to the support of fossil fuel and other extractive
industries, resulting in the neglect of a fiduciary responsibility to
ensure the fulfillment of the right to clean water, air, and land. [As a
result, "the tensions of capitalism are being played out on a global,
biospheric scale and thus implicate the future of life on
earth"]{.underline} (Cooper, 2008, p. 49, in Pierce, 2012, p. 24). This
is an economic paradigm that banks its future on scientific and
technological advances designed to capitalize on forms of life (Pierce,
2012). Thus, relational validity implies that research is not only about
understanding or chronicling the relationality of life and the
inadequacy of economic validity but also that research necessarily
influences these conditions in small or significant ways; it thus impels
action and increased accountability to people and place. Because no
action is an action, and because not acting has implications, a more
adequate response is required for current and future injustices
(McKenzie, 2009).

Tomonori **Sugimoto** 09-11-**13** \["The Yellow Man\'s Burden: The
Politics of Settler Colonialism in Hokkaidō and Taiwan"\] \[DS\]
\[https://escholarship.org/uc/item/07c7b5f6\]

Following Wolfe and Stoler, I have been tracing [settler colonialism
in]{.underline} Hokkaidō and [Taiwan as an ongoing process that
\"saturate\[s\] the subsoil of \[indigenous\] people\'s lives and
\[that\] persis\[s\], sometimes subjacently, over a long
dureé]{.underline}\" (Stoler 2008:192). I roughly focused on the last
one hundred and fifty years, examining the emergence of what I term
[settler colonial biopower in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries in the Japanese Empire]{.underline} and the mutations of this
mode of power in the subsequent settler regimes. This particular form of
[power instituted by the Japanese]{.underline} imperial government was
guided by liberal humanist sentiments: it attempted to make indigenous
peoples live through caring for, [protecting, and nurturing them so that
they would gradually assimilate into the new settler society founded on
the colonized indigenous lands. The postwar regimes in Taiwan and Japan
mostly inherited this power and emphasized the assimilation of the
indigenous populations into settler society, as they attempted to
configure themselves as ethnically homogenous
nation-states]{.underline}. 75 While this mode of power has not
completely disappeared, a significant change is occurring in these two
settler colonial formations due to the rise of liberal multiculturalism.
In the age of multiculturalism, the logic of cultural recognition
emerged as a self-critique of the past assimilatory policies. This new
logic cunningly deflects critiques directed at the liberal settler
nation-state as it purports to correct itself to advance an even better
liberalism (Povinelli 2001). Settler colonial violence inherent in and
enacted by liberalism is often left unexamined. Liberal
multiculturalism, therefore, fails to be a critical force for
decolonization, deimperialization, or de-Cold War. Some might say that
challenging multiculturalism might be counter-effective when some
right-wing politicians, authors, and activists attack even the
legitimacy of multiculturalist projects. In Japan, for example, some
have been questioning the necessity of multicultural projects for Ainu
people saying that taxpayers\' money should not be spent on the
protection of a race that does not exist any more and that the Ainu
Association is merely reproducing discrimination to secure funding from
the state. 29 Attacking the multicultural state might dangerously
overlap with such extremely settler colonial, racist, and neoliberal
attack on multiculturalism. I am not arguing that the state should
completely recede from multiculturalist policies. My point is that, as
Simpson (2011) forcefully argues in the epigraph, multiculturalism needs
to \"be paired with structures, peoples, and institutions that labor for
a radically different historical consciousness, one that is deeply
cognizant of the means of its own societal production so that it may
afford Indigeneity (and the condition of many others) a robust present
as well as a vigorous, variegated past and future" (212). How can this
consciousness be cultivated? I discussed transnational-solidarity
projects between the yuanzhumin and the Ainu as one of such sites where
indigenous (and non-indigenous) people can reflect on the histories of
settler colonial violence in Asia and the Pacific and develop a critical
awareness to challenge the active participation of the liberal
nation-states in it. [In order to work toward decolonization,
deimperialization, and de-Cold War in Asia and the Pacific, it is time
for anthropologists too to rewrite and reread the history of the region
from an indigenous-centered perspective and acknowledge our historical
complicity with settler colonialism and racism. My thesis hopes to
contribute to such rereading and rewriting in rudimentary ways. We also
need to turn to dissident praxes among indigenous subjects and sites of
subversion that they create within liberal multiculturalism, rather than
obsessive descriptions of "indigenous culture" that have flourished with
the rise of multiculturalist discourse (Wolfe 1999). The transnational
solidariy-building project between]{.underline} the Ainu and [the
Taiwanese indigenous peoples is certainly one example of such praxes.
Only by refusing the role of \"the agent of love\" 30 assigned to us in
multiculturalism can anthropologists radicalize the past, present, and
future of settler colonial formations such as Taiwan]{.underline} and
Hokkaidō.
