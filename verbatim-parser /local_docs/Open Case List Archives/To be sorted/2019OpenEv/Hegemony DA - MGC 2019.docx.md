#### Trump is sustaining US grand strategy through arms sales---abandoning those deals signals shift in military strategy

Before becoming president, [Trump threatened to tear up long-standing
alliances. He branded NATO outmoded, expensive, irrelevant to
contemporary security problems, and "obsolete]{.underline}."151 At other
times, [he threatened to change the basis of alliances]{.underline},
making what had been permanent U.S. commitments more conditional and
transactional, issuing threats to allies in Europe and Asia that the
United States might abandon them if they did not pay up.152 Trump
implied similar policies for the Persian Gulf. As a candidate, [Trump
argued that Saudi Arabia, as the traditional bulwark of U.S. power
projection in the Gulf, should pay more for the United States\'
"tremendous service]{.underline}," accusing it of complicity in the
September 11 attacks.153 Trump suggested that he would accommodate the
United States\' rivals, especially Russia. He promised to give Russia,
NATO\'s resurgent adversary, a freer geopolitical hand. He would shift
burdens by forcing allies to pay for protection. Such [open threats
struck against the grand strategy of primacy]{.underline}, which regards
permanent commitments as essential even if the distribution of
sacrifices is lopsided. [Within]{.underline} only [months]{.underline}
of his presidency, **[Trump altered both the rhetoric and substance of
his stance toward allies]{.underline}**. By April 2017, NATO was "no
longer obsolete."154 In May, Trump increased by 40 percent the United
States\' European Reassurance Initiative, established by Obama to signal
the U.S. commitment to Europe with increased troops, infrastructure, and
exercises after Russia\'s annexation of Crimea in 2014.155 In addresses
in Brussels in May 2017 and Warsaw in July, [Trump signaled support for
NATO]{.underline} while insisting its members contribute more.156 By
June, he had reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to Article 5 of the NATO
Charter.157 At the urging of advisers, Trump now took only a more
abrasive version of the position taken by every president since
Eisenhower---that NATO is vital, but that member states should
contribute more. In the Middle East, [Trump embraced Saudi Arabia and
the Gulf monarchies in the United States\' traditional role as armorer
and protector; in his May visit to Riyadh, he **signed a \$110 billion
arms deal**]{.underline} and jettisoned "America First" rhetoric in
favor of "bipartisan internationalism."158 Within six months of taking
office, [Trump\'s strategic vision for the world\'s key power
centers]{.underline}---the Gulf, Europe, and East Asia---[held the
United States to be the principal security provider]{.underline}. In
Asia, Secretary for Defense James Mattis reassured Japan and South Korea
of U.S. alliance commitments.159 Toward Russia, Trump did not lift
sanctions imposed to penalize Moscow\'s adventurism in the Ukraine.
**[He authorized the sale of "defensive" weapons to Ukraine against
Russia-leaning separatists]{.underline}**, **[sold Patriot missiles to
Poland]{.underline}**, [and demanded that Russia withdraw from
Crime]{.underline}a. In its 2017 National Security Strategy, the Trump
administration promised continued primacy, dominance in key regions, and
counterproliferation, while more explicitly acknowledging competition
with rivals.160 [Trump]{.underline} also has [rededicated the United
States to military preponderance and the frequent use of force that is a
hallmark of U.S. unipolarity]{.underline}. Campaigning for office, Trump
denounced his opponent\'s hawkishness. He promised to reduce and focus
the use of force, to "stop racing to topple foreign regimes that we know
nothing about, that we shouldn\'t be involved with," to withdraw from
Afghanistan,161 to avoid nation-building expeditions, and to focus on
the Islamic State and counterterrorism.162 Upon taking office, [Trump
showed a propensity toward using force]{.underline}. By July 31, 2017,
he had overseen the unleashing of 80 percent of the total number of
bombs dropped by the United States under Obama during the whole of 2016,
including the most bombs dropped on Afghanistan since 2012.163 He also
increased the U.S. ground commitment to Afghanistan.164 In the name of
deterring the use of chemical weapons, Trump bombed President Bashar
al-Assad\'s regime in Syria. He also bolstered U.S. military deployments
to NATO\'s eastern flank. Trump declared an increased defense budget and
an ambition for nuclear supremacy. His combination of arms buildup and
budget expansion amounted to "warmed-over Reaganism"; and like Reagan,
Trump\'s administration formulated its budget on the advice of the
primacist Heritage Foundation.165 [Trump also conformed with the
tradition of "inhibition," forcefully confronting North Korea over its
nuclear and missile programs]{.underline}. While campaigning[, he
suggested he would tolerate nuclear proliferation by South Korea, Japan,
and Saudi Arabia.]{.underline} [He imagined negotiating with the "rogue"
proliferator]{.underline}, North Korea\'s ruler Kim Jong-un, suggesting
that nuclear proliferation was both inevitable and acceptable.166 These
sentiments violated decades of tradition, whereby the United States has
inhibited proliferation through security guarantees, troop deployments,
arms sales, nuclear umbrellas, and sanctions threats. By the summer of
2017, Trump had converted to denuclearization and was engaged in
brinkmanship with North Korea, attempting to coerce Pyongyang to abandon
its nuclear ambitions. In July 2017, he approved plans to increase U.S.
freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea, to resist
Chinese expansion.167 **[Trump\'s America exercises military
preponderance, maintains alliances, and pursues
counterproliferation]{.underline}**---even at the risk of war---[to
forestall the emergence of challengers and prevent a return to
multipolar disorder.]{.underline} EXPLAINING CONTINUITY: TRUMP AND THE
BLOB [Trump\'s conformity on major grand-strategic questions fits my
argument\'s predictions]{.underline}. He took office at a time when the
electorate was buffeted by war weariness and the long-term stresses of
the 2008 global financial crisis. These [**pressures could have been a
basis for grand strategic revision. Yet Trump is not trying to overhaul
grand strategy.** He has been unwilling to spend the political capital
that such a revision would require]{.underline}. [In the absence of a
determined agent of change, the Blob\'s advantages persist]{.underline}.
[The Blob has a privileged position in presidential staffing and
security expertise; it exerts dominance over the security discourse; and
**it is reinforced by the demands of allies.**]{.underline}

#### US influence in the middle east is a conflict dampener

**Brands 19** (Hal Brands- Henry A. Kissinger Distinguished Professor of
Global Affairs at the John Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies and a Senior Fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary
Assessments, 3-21-2019, \"Why America Can\'t Quit The Middle East,\"
Hoover Institution,
<https://www.hoover.org/research/why-america-cant-quit-middle-east>) RK

One of the most persistent myths about U.S. foreign policy is the idea
that America desires---due to greed, messianic ideological impulses, or
simple imperial presumptions---to dominate the Middle East. In reality,
[American policy has long been torn by two conflicting imperatives: The
need to protect enduring U.S. interests, on the one hand, and the desire
to stay clear of the region's unending headaches, on the
othe]{.underline}r. Paul Wolfowitz
[remarked](https://books.google.com/books?id=wcljXYTZVnUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=rise+of+the+vulcans&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjMsZTm7M3gAhWhc98KHU7-AIAQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=sunlight&f=false)
once that his shift from focusing on the Middle East to working on East
Asia was like "walking out of some oppressive, stuffy room into sunlight
and fresh air." To borrow the metaphor, American officials have long
desired to walk toward the sunlight---while understanding that they
cannot fully escape the darkness. Today, [calls for the United States to
disengage militarily from the Middle East are commonplace]{.underline}.
Those calls reflect deep frustration with the travails of American
interventions over the past two decades, as well as the
belief---entirely correct---that the United States faces greater
challenges elsewhere. [Yet U.S. interests in the region have not
disappeared, and the prospect that Middle Eastern troubles will impact
America if left unattended is as high as ever]{.underline}. **[If the
United States rushes for the exits, it may find that it is pulled back
under worse circumstances, and at higher costs, in the
future]{.underline}**. President Trump is giving voice to a powerful and
understandable urge to cut cleanly and get out of the Middle East. The
best approach, however, may be one that reflects America's longstanding
ambivalence about the region. The [interests that have long kept the
United States involved in the Middle East are fairly clear]{.underline}.
Coming out of World War II, American strategists resolved that [the
United States must prevent any hostile force from dominating a region of
critical geopolitical or geo-economic significance]{.underline}. The
Middle East, with its vast oil reserves, certainly fit that description.
True, America never got a particularly large portion of its oil from
Middle Eastern sources. But its allies did: "The Marshall Plan for
Europe,"
[noted](https://books.google.com/books?id=nGqoAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA267&dq=what+good+is+grand+strategy+middle+east+oil+forrestal&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjM7JyJ7c3gAhWKc98KHXGRAg0Q6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=what%20good%20is%20grand%20strategy%20middle%20east%20oil%20forrestal&f=false)
Truman's first Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal, "could not succeed
without access to the Middle East oil." Moreover, the fact that oil was
traded on a global market meant that a disruption of price or supply in
one region would cause disruption on a far larger scale. At present, the
United States is again becoming a net energy exporter and a swing
producer in the global oil market. Yet [so long as the countries of the
Middle East sit atop huge energy reserves that confer great wealth and
power on whoever controls it, the strategic importance of the Middle
East]{.underline}---[and the imperative of keeping it out of hostile
hands---will remain.]{.underline} Other issues have also kept the United
States engaged. Since the 1970s, America has had a critical interest in
preventing or combating international terrorism, much of which emerges
from the Middle East[. American policymakers have been properly
concerned with confronting aggression against friendly nations and
preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction to rogue states or
non-state actors]{.underline}. [Then there is the American interest in
promoting peace, democracy, and human rights in the Middle East---one
that has never been as important as the other U.S. interests, that has
affected how even the most cynical, "realist" administrations have
approached the region.]{.underline} Over a period of decades, these
issues have exerted a strong gravitational pull on American policy,
making it impossible for U.S. officials to ignore the region. And yet
American policymakers have often been equally aware of the problems that
U.S. engagement presents. The situation in the Middle East, Dean Acheson
once
[commented](https://books.google.com/books?id=nGqoAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA55&dq=what+good+is+grand+strategy+karl+marx&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiUjKb77M3gAhWNmeAKHQXeDNMQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&q=what%20good%20is%20grand%20strategy%20karl%20marx&f=false),
"might have been devised by Karl Marx himself." A combination of stunted
development, stifling socio-political conditions, and resentment of
foreign influence made the region ripe for radicalism and inherently
difficult for outside powers to manage. Getting deeply involved in the
Middle East ran the risk of making America the target of that radicalism
and anger; it also ran the risk of distracting the United States from
other areas where the prospects for constructive change seemed more
promising. The Middle East, Wolfowitz
[lamented](https://books.google.com/books?id=wcljXYTZVnUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=rise+of+the+vulcans&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjMsZTm7M3gAhWhc98KHU7-AIAQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=sunlight&f=false),
was an area "where people only know how to create problems." The result
has been a perpetual tension: The Middle East might require American
attention and management, but it was also a source of dangers and
distractions that most U.S. officials would have been just as happy to
avoid. This tension has been omnipresent as the U.S. role in the Middle
East has expanded since the 1970s, following the British withdrawal from
the region. During the late 1970s and 1980s, the United States [built
up](https://books.google.com/books?id=bKA9DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=making+the+unipolar+moment&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjsutKm7c3gAhXiYd8KHSzBAsgQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=making%20the%20unipolar%20moment&f=false)
the military capabilities necessary to prevent the Soviet Union (or
perhaps a hostile Iran) from dominating the region. During the Iran-Iraq
War, the Reagan administration supported Saddam Hussein as a bulwark
against Tehran's influence. But at the same time, the United States
refrained from a significant "onshore" military presence in the Persian
Gulf out of fear of inciting terrorist attacks, offending local
sensitivities, or discrediting friendly regimes. Once the Iran-Iraq War
ended, American military capabilities started flowing out of the region,
to be refocused on other priorities. That trend was reversed after
Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait prompted a massive, U.S.-led
intervention to restore the regional balance of power, as well as a
persistent post-conflict military presence to keep an eye on Saddam's
wounded but still dangerous regime. As early as 1990-91, however, U.S.
officials had been deeply
[ambivalent](https://books.google.com/books?id=bKA9DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=making+the+unipolar+moment&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjsutKm7c3gAhXiYd8KHSzBAsgQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=making%20the%20unipolar%20moment&f=false)
about the idea of permanently stationing American forces in Saudi Arabia
or other Gulf countries. They worried that such a presence might make
American forces the target of terrorist groups that opposed
authoritarian governments in the Persian Gulf---warnings that seemed
vindicated when al-Qaeda began taking aim at U.S. targets in the region
and far beyond. The 9/11 attacks offered evidence that the Middle East's
problems could reach out and touch the United States in disastrous ways.
The George W. Bush administration responded with the massive projection
of American power into the region, focused on defeating al-Qaeda,
toppling hostile governments in Afghanistan and Iraq, birthing stable
democracies, and thereby transforming the region for the better. When
that project proved vastly more costly and difficult than expected, the
Obama administration sought to limit U.S. engagement in the region as a
way of husbanding resources, avoiding blowback, and "pivoting" to more
promising areas. Yet even Obama, so skeptical of American intervention
in the region, was unable to get out entirely: The persistent threat of
terrorism compelled continuing engagement in Afghanistan; humanitarian
concerns triggered military action in Libya; the U.S. withdrawal from
Iraq and inaction in Syria contributed to a regional meltdown that
ultimately compelled re-intervention to deal with a new and terrifying
threat from ISIS. The story of American policy in the Middle East has
been one of engagement---sometimes remarkably intensive and violent
engagement---but also one of recurring ambivalence about that
engagement. Today, the [Trump]{.underline} administration [is
manifesting]{.underline} the same [ambivalence]{.underline}. The
president reportedly referred to Syria as a country offering only "sand
and death," and he announced plans for a complete withdrawal of U.S.
troops. [Trump appears to be eyeing the exits in
Afghanistan]{.underline} as well. But at the same time, a familiar set
of factors is making other U.S. officials reluctant to countenance a
broad withdrawal. The U.S. intelligence community has warned that a
complete pullout from Afghanistan could lead to a major terrorist attack
on the American homeland within two years. [There are also concerns that
American retrenchment would open the door for hostile
actors]{.underline}---Iran and Russia---[to exert dominant influence in
a region that still matters]{.underline}. Trump is a most unorthodox
president, but he faces the same dilemma that has long afflicted U.S.
policy in the Middle East. Indeed, that dilemma may explain why the
president---after insisting for months that the United States would
withdraw entirely from Syria, just recently indicated that a token
American force might remain. [So what can this history tell us about how
to proceed today?]{.underline} Three key points are in order. First,
there is a critical need to meter U.S. involvement in the Middle East.
This is not simply because large-scale interventions have proven so
unrewarding over the past two decades. It is also because the need to
confront other, more important issues---namely the threats posed by
China and Russia---is undeniable. There is a finite amount of resources,
time, and political will the United States can devote to foreign policy
issues. And when Washington overcommits to a region as frustrating as
the Middle East, it risks undermining public support for U.S. foreign
policy not just in that region but around the world. If the United
States goes big in the Middle East, it will sooner or later face strong
pressures to go home. Second, however[, it is a fantasy to think that
the United States can disengage from the Middle East without
consequence]{.underline}. This is because [America still has pressing
interests in that region]{.underline}---and because those interests are
as unlikely to protect themselves today as they ever have been in the
past. **[Growing Russian influence, Iran's hegemonic ambitions, the
potential resurgence of key terrorist organizations, and the massive
political instability and violence that plagues large swaths of the
region are real problems that demand competent
management]{.underline}**. [America's partners in the region can do more
to manage those problems than they have done to date, but they remain
manifestly incapable of doing so without significant U.S.
support.]{.underline} Third, hasty withdrawals are likely to be followed
by hasty re-engagements. After the United States left Iraq in 2011, the
state nearly collapsed, ISIS surged to prominence, and an emergency
military intervention---which has now lasted nearly five years---was
needed to repair the damage. If the United States disengages from Syria
and Afghanistan today and the result is a significant terrorist attack,
the pressure to get back into the region and take decisive military
action will be strong indeed---even if that means shortchanging other
geopolitical priorities. If America goes home from the Middle East, it
will sooner or later face pressures to go big. Whatever policies the
Trump administration pursues in the Middle East, then, [the United
States will continue to face the same conflicting imperatives that have
long shaped its approach to that region. America will be drawn toward
the Middle East by enduring interests and pressing threats]{.underline}.
[But it will be tempted to depart the region because of the dangers and
costs U.S. engagement causes.]{.underline} In these circumstances, [a
responsible strategy would focus on minimizing the dangers and costs of
engagement by suppressing the most serious threats at the lowest
expenditure of resources. This]{.underline} [might entail using a select
subset of capabilities]{.underline}---**[special operations forces,
tactical airpower, support for local forces]{.underline}**---[to keep
the pressure]{.underline} [on the most dangerous terrorist groups and
prevent them from mounting major external attacks]{.underline}. (This
was, in essence, the strategy the United States was following prior to
Trump's Syria withdrawal announcement.) Likewise, [it might focus on
empowering---with]{.underline} intelligence, diplomatic, and [military
support---anti-Iran actors in the region and thereby maintaining a
tolerable balance of power]{.underline}. In Afghanistan, this might mean
continuing to push for a negotiated peace deal, but only with adequate
assurances that an American withdrawal would not turn that country into
a terrorist playground---and without telegraphing a near-term retreat
that will only make such assurances harder to obtain. [The worst
strategies,]{.underline} by contrast, [would be those that skew toward
the extremes of deeper engagement or precipitate
withdrawal]{.underline}, [inviting some adverse development that would
cause an overcorrection in the future]{.underline}. "Muddle through" is
rarely the sort of advice that wins a lot of applause. But it may be the
best approach to managing America's continuing strategic ambivalence
about the Middle East.

#### Saudi depends on US arms sales for counter-terror and regional balancing

**Khoury 18** (Nabeel Khoury- nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic
Council's Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East, 10-23-18, \"Oil,
Arms, and Counterterrorism: A Look At Saudi Options and How Far the

RK

[Arms sales]{.underline} Weapon purchases by Middle Eastern countries,
especially Arab Gulf countries, have indeed been a valued source of
income, particularly for the United States, the United Kingdom, France,
and Germany. [Middle Eastern purchases accounted for almost half of US
arms exports from 2013-17]{.underline}. Saudi Arabia tops the list as
the largest buyer. [Saudi Arabia has gone on a massive arms-buying
spree]{.underline}, according to a new report by the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). In the last five years,
Saudi Arabia increased its arms purchases by 225 percent compared to the
previous five-year period. [Yearly sales from Western countries to
Middle Eastern countries have increased over the past decade, with US
arms sales to Saudi Arabia]{.underline} rising from under \$400 million
in 2010 to \$10 billion in 2017. Sales from the United Kingdom rose from
\$550 million to \$4 billion for the same period. [Saudi
Arabia,]{.underline} however, [has in the process upped the percentage
of its purchases from Europe and the United States to 98 percent of its
overall arms imports.]{.underline} [This is a significant dependency
that would be very hard, if not impossible, to break]{.underline}. Saudi
Arabia's attempts to diversify its sources of weaponry has thus far been
unsuccessful. [This dependency goes beyond mere dollar figures and
percentages to the difficulty of changing weapon systems, personnel
training, and war strategies.]{.underline} Here the dependency is total
because while European weapons can easily be made interoperable with US
weapons, this is not the case with weapons purchased from Russia and
China. [The Saudis would need an entirely different approach and
training for their military forces.]{.underline} Bruce Riedel, the
author of Kings and Presidents, a book that narrates the story of Saudi
dependency on the United States, says that of the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) countries, Saudi Arabia would have the most difficulty in
switching over to a different system of security and weaponry. [This
Saudi dependency is not new]{.underline}. The kingdom has relied on the
United States for its security since the very beginning, when Franklin
D. Roosevelt struck an oil versus security arrangement with King
Abdulaziz toward the end of World War II. [In stressing the need to
maintain good relations with Saudi Arabia, Trump has asserted 500,000 US
jobs would be at stake should the Saudis stop buying US
arms]{.underline}---an inflated figure even according to State
Department assessments. [The United States is, in fact, the only country
in the world that could sustain a weapons industry with purchases needed
for its own military.]{.underline} Counterterrorism cooperation [Outside
the obvious Saudi dependency on the United States to come to its defense
in the highly unlikely scenario of a direct attack by Iran,
counterterrorism collaboration is a double edged sword]{.underline}.
[The kingdom is much more vulnerable to terrorist attacks than the
United States, being in the neighborhood where al Qaeda has long
operated and where ISIS now remains]{.underline}, not only in Syria and
Iraq, but more importantly next door in Yemen. All this to say that
raising the specter of a cut-off of economic, military, and security
cooperation by Saudi Arabia is bogus. It would be the equivalent of the
proverbial cutting off one's nose to spite one's face. [Saudi Arabia is
much more dependent on the United States]{.underline} than the other way
around. In weighting how much pressure to apply to affect Saudi behavior
in the region, the Trump administration should not be overly concerned
with losing significant equities, as has been repeatedly implied by
Trump and by other administration officials.

#### Arms support to saudi is key to US influence in Yemen---key to stop the war in yemen

In a new resolution, [a bipartisan group of senators is calling for the
United States to end its involvement]{.underline}---specifically its
support of Saudi Arabia---[in the Yemen conflict]{.underline}. On
Wednesday, the Senate voted 63-37 to pass a procedural measure that will
clear the way for a floor debate on the issue next week. The push comes
largely in response to the recent murder of Saudi journalist Jamal
Khashoggi. Get exclusive insider information from Heritage experts

The Trump administration has banned 21 Saudi suspects in that murder
from entering the U.S., imposed sanctions on 17 Saudi officials, and
expressed its willingness to take further action if warranted by ongoing
investigations. Many senators seek to do more to punish the Saudis, even
if it means sacrificing the interests of the Yemeni government and
making a negotiated settlement of the conflict more difficult. [The
killing of Khashoggi was certainly abhorrent, but ending U.S. support
for the multinational coalition in Yemen is not the proper solution. It
risks dangerously conflating two separate issues and would inevitably
trigger unintended consequences that would undermine U.S. national
security interests in the region.]{.underline} Senators must remember
that Saudi Arabia is not the only belligerent in Yemen. A cutoff of U.S.
support would also hurt the elected and internationally recognized
government of Yemen, which was ousted by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in
2015 in a bloody coup that violated a [U.N.-brokered
ceasefire](https://www.cnn.com/2014/09/21/world/meast/yemen-prime-minister-resigns/index.html).
[Withdrawing U.S. support would also harm the interests of other U.S.
allies fighting in Yemen, including the United Arab Emirates and
Bahrain. The war in Yemen is complex. Those who rush to blame Saudi
Arabia entirely for the suffering of the Yemeni people ignore the war
crimes and heavy-handed treatment meted out by the Houthis to their
opponents and the ruthless role that Iran plays in supporting the Houthi
Ansar Allah ("Supporters of Allah") movement, a Shia Islamist extremist
group.]{.underline} The Saudis are rightly criticized for not doing more
to prevent civilian casualties as they target Ansar Allah positions. But
the Houthis should not be given a free pass for deliberately targeting
civilian targets in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates with
increasingly sophisticated Iranian ballistic missiles. [Ansar Allah also
deserves criticism for its violent role in destabilizing Yemen and
creating the conditions that led to the current humanitarian
disaster]{.underline}. Ansar Allah regularly attacks the Saudi border,
launches missiles strikes into Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates, and diverts international medical and food aid to favor its
own supporters and sell on the black market. Ansar Allah also has
targeted U.S. Navy vessels, those of allied nations, and civilian
shipping in the [Red
Sea](https://www.heritage.org/middle-east/commentary/bab-el-mandeb-the-us-ignores-the-most-dangerous-strait-the-world-its-peril)
with Iranian-supplied missiles, gunboat attacks, and boat bombs.
Undermining the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen risks exacerbating this
threat to international shipping and giving Iran the opportunity to
threaten oil shipments through the Bab al-Mandab Strait, just as it has
threatened to do in the Strait of Hormuz. [Those who advocate
withdrawing support for Saudi Arabia apparently believe that they can
somehow end the current conflict in Yemen through a one-sided strategy
that penalizes allies and boosts Ansar Allah]{.underline}, a group that
chants "Death to America" and looks more like Hezbollah, Iran's Lebanese
proxy group, every day. [Never mind that Saudi Arabia is supporting the
internationally recognized government of Yemen in this effort. Never
mind that leaving Ansar Allah to run amuck will not bring an end to the
humanitarian suffering, but only prolong it. The U.S. currently extends
only limited support to Saudi Arabia in Yemen centered on intelligence
and information sharing]{.underline}. There are no U.S. troops involved
in combat operations, except for occasional commando raids and air
strikes against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a Sunni terrorist
group that continues to target the U.S. homeland, as well as Saudi
Arabia, France, and other countries. [The Trump administration already
has stopped the aerial refueling of Saudi warplanes involved in the
Yemen conflict and called for a negotiated settlement]{.underline}.
**[But the United States cannot afford to abandon its allies and hope
for the best]{.underline}**. [Undermining the Yemeni government and the
Saudi-led coalition would make an acceptable political settlement
impossible.]{.underline} [The Yemeni government and Saudi Arabia will
continue to fight this war with or without U.S. support. Those who would
connect two unrelated issues, condemn Saudi involvement, and ignore
Iran's hostile role inside Yemen will only do more harm to innocent
Yemeni civilians and empower Iran and its Yemeni proxies.]{.underline}

It will also tell us which set of advisors he is most inclined to listen
to: [pragmatists, like incoming National Security Advisor retired Lt.
General Mike Flynn, who prioritize the fight against militant Salafism,
or neoconservatives who see Iranian influence as the primary threat to
regional stability]{.underline}. While the war in Yemen has received
limited coverage, **[it is just as brutal as the war in Syria and just
as critical to regional stability]{.underline}**. Yemen is located along
the Bab al Mandeb in the Red Sea, one of the world's critical shipping
corridors. [It is also home to the most lethal and nimble branch of
al-Qaeda]{.underline}. As befits its byzantine politics and rugged
terrain, Yemen's civil war is decidedly complex. Broadly speaking, the
Houthis, a Zaidi Shi'a rebel group that controls northwest Yemen, are
fighting Yemen's government in exile nominally led by President Abd
Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Yemen's government in exile is supported by Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United
States. Despite evidence to the contrary, Saudi Arabia views the Houthis
as Iranian proxies. In March 2015, Saudi Arabia and its allies launched
"Operation Decisive Storm" --- a campaign to defeat the Houthis and
reinstall the pro-Saudi government in exile. Fast forward nearly two
years and **[Saudi Arabia and its partners have little to show for
intense aerial bombardment]{.underline}** and an estimated expenditure
of 5 billion dollars by Saudi Arabia alone. The Houthis and their
allies, which include Yemen's former president Ali Abdullah Saleh (even
though the Houthis fought six wars against Saleh's government), remain
in control of the capital and most of northwest Yemen. **[The southern
half of Yemen is loosely controlled by a motley mix of nominally
pro-government in exile forces, tribal militias, southern separatists
and militant Salafis, namely al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula
(AQAP)]{.underline}**. [The Saudi and Emirati led war in Yemen has been
decisive, although not in the ways that were intended]{.underline}.
**[AQAP, which was on the ropes before the war, is now resurgent and the
war has empowered the Houthis rather than defeated them]{.underline}**.
In March 2012, long before the Houthis took over Sana'a, one of Yemen's
elder statesmen told me, "[The Houthis know nothing about governing or
running a country but the one thing they can do is fight]{.underline}."
[The same long-serving politician went on to issue a prescient warning,
"fighting is where their power lies. If there is a war, they will win,
without it, they will lose."]{.underline} Four years later, the Houthis
have demonstrated that they can indeed fight. Saudi Arabia's aerial
campaign which has targeted bridges, schools, factories and even a
funeral has allowed the Houthis to cast themselves as "defenders of the
nation." [The Houthis probably enjoy more support now than they ever
have]{.underline}. **[AQAP too has been empowered by the war in
Yemen]{.underline}**. The Houthis and AQAP are enemies since Salafis
regard all Shi'a as heretics. Before the start of the Saudi-led war, the
Houthis and the tribal militias allied with them were on the offensive
against AQAP. [AQAP was underfunded and was having a hard time
recruiting enough men to replenish its ranks]{.underline}. [With the
start of the Saudi campaign, all of this changed]{.underline}. [AQAP was
once again able to go on the offensive]{.underline}. In the months
following the launch of Operation Decisive Storm, AQAP surged across
southern Yemen. [It seized stores of weapons and materiel abandoned by
Yemeni troops and it took over Yemen's fifth largest city,
Mukalla]{.underline}. There, it raided a branch of the Yemeni Central
Bank and walked away with 100 million dollars . In April, Mukalla was
retaken by Saudi and Emirati-backed forces. However, this loss of
territory, which was described by AQAP as a strategic retreat, has had
little effect on the organization. [If anything, AQAP has benefited from
being more mobile]{.underline}. In what is a dangerous parallel with
militant Salafist organizations in Syria fighting the Assad government,
AQAP is focused on enmeshing itself within those forces battling the
Houthis . During his campaign, Trump prioritized the need to fight
militant Salafism, stating that he will work with Russian President
Vladimir Putin to battle the Islamic State in Syria. Yet the
president-elect has repeatedly described the nuclear agreement with Iran
as " the worst deal ever negotiated ." This could well lead one to
believe that a Trump administration will listen to neoconservatives.
[The same neoconservatives whose policies---like invading Iraq---have,
more than anything else, empowered Iran]{.underline}. If
neoconservatives like John Bolton exert influence on the
president-elect, a focus on rolling back Iranian influence in the region
will likely come at the expense of fighting militant Salafism. [With a
pragmatic approach to the war in Yemen, the incoming Trump
administration could achieve both aims]{.underline}. It could check
Iranian influence by exerting real and sustained pressure on Saudi
Arabia to end its largely futile campaign against the Houthis. While the
evidence that Houthis are Iranian proxies is dubious, [Iran can only be
delighted by the fact that Saudi Arabia is mired in a costly war that it
cannot win]{.underline}. The **[cessation of the Saudi-led aerial
campaign]{.underline}** and the lifting of the naval blockade
**[are]{.underline}** both **[critical first steps toward stopping an
unfolding humanitarian catastrophe and restarting Yemeni-driven
negotiations]{.underline}**. These [negotiations were at an advanced
stage before the Saudi intervention in Yemen]{.underline} . [Restarting
meaningful negotiations and addressing Yemen's dire humanitarian crisis
are both prerequisites for combating a resurgent AQAP]{.underline}.
**[AQAP---like all militant Salafi organizations---feeds on poverty and
chaos and thrives in ungoverned spaces]{.underline}**. For nearly two
years, **[AQAP has had an almost free hand in southern
Yemen]{.underline}**. **[The Trump administration's response to the war
in Yemen will be telling]{.underline}**. Will the president-elect buy
into Saudi Arabia's and the neoconservatives' Iran-centric view of the
conflict? And if this is the case, will he continue to embrace policies
and measures that enable Saudi Arabia to continue its increasingly
brutal war? Or will he be more inclined to listen to advisors like Mike
Flynn who view militant Salafism as the primary threat to regional
stability? If this is the case, then **[ending the war and stabilizing
Yemen should be high on the incoming president's list]{.underline}**.
What is certain is that **[how Trump responds to the war in Yemen will
show the region just how capable the new president and his advisors are
of addressing conflicts that demand calculated, pragmatic, and
well-balanced responses]{.underline}**.

#### Decreasing US arms sale causes Chinese and Russian fill-in---gives up US allies and partnerships in important areas like india, middle east, and south east asia

[The potential for unilateral restraint in drones is over]{.underline}.
To date, [the United States has been extremely discrete in exporting
unmanned systems (particularly armed ones]{.underline}). But somewhat
comparable products are now readily available from multiple sources in
the global market. Over the past five years Israel has filled the gap,
delivering 43 percent of all drone exports, with China a rising
competitor at 32 percent (source SIPRI[). If the United States begins
exporting unmanned aerial vehicles more freely, American drones are
likely to both dominate the market and be subject to more rigorous
regulatio]{.underline}n. That said, the economic boom is likely to be
modest; the entire annual military unmanned aerial vehicle market is
projected to be under \$10 billion as late as 2026. [The security
benefits for the United States of drone exports remain considerable
however. Interoperability among networked drones from multiple countries
will likely play an enormous role in future "informationalized"
conflict.]{.underline} Strong security incentives exist for the United
States to ensure that allies operate its unmanned systems. Export
Capability First The State and Defense Departments must maintain the
professional identity of Security Cooperation Offices. [Concentrate on
improving allied military performance first]{.underline}, any modest
economic benefits second. Sometimes American weapons are not the right
answer. Potential customers and balancers against China such as Taiwan
and Vietnam would be better off buying defensive weapons such as
anti-ship missiles and diesel submarines (ideally produced by Germany or
South Korea rather than Russia) than most American products. [Keep China
Down, Russia Out, and Friendly States In A smart arms transfer policy
would strangle both Russia, the number two exporter, and China, which is
trying to take its place]{.underline}. [Russia in particular needs arms
exports to fund its aggressive but underfunded military modernization
plans (not to mention hard currency for its weak economy). It is in
America's interests to choke off as large a percentage of the Russian
export market as possible in favor of the products of more closely
aligned countries.]{.underline} In terms of both [American influence and
curbing proliferation]{.underline}, it is better for countries like
Malaysia and Indonesia to buy German or South Korean submarines than
Russian. This will have the added benefit of diminishing the quality
and, eventually, raising the price of the products Russia will export to
states, such as Syria, that cannot buy arms from anywhere else. In the
spirit of bolstering potential partners and limiting the reach of
Russian weapons, [the United States can directly compete against Russia
in one important market]{.underline}. India accounts for a stunning 39
percent of Russia's recent arms exports (SIPRI). Indian orders might be
big enough to provide some meaningful economic benefits to the United
States, but more importantly, U.S. sales would cut into Russia's market
share. [Tying India and the United States closer, even if it means
allowing most production, jobs, and even some technology transfer to go
abroad, should be a central goal of U.S. arms transfer
policy]{.underline}. Lockheed Martin's offer to transfer the F-16
production line to India appears a step in this direction. [America
should accept that Saudi Arabia is going to buy a lot of U.S.
weapons,]{.underline} but avoid coddling the Kingdom. Saudi Arabia (and
its Gulf State allies) will remain an important customer largely because
the country is desperate to keep the United States involved in the
region. The [Saudi military is almost entirely American equipped and
trained and most of its military capability requires continued American
support to function for more than a couple of days]{.underline}. A few
additional jobs may result from selling more arms to the Kingdom, but
this may not justify giving up the leverage over Saudi and its allies'
policies towards Yemen, Syria, and Qatar that do not necessarily advance
American interests. T[he United States should encourage]{.underline},
but steer, [Europe]{.underline}. Since the Cold War the [United States
has used its economic and political clout to systematically inhibit an
independent European defense production capability]{.underline}. This
has certainly increased U.S. market share, but continued efforts come at
the expense of more important political goals. It would be much easier
to ask NATO allies to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense if more of
this money would go into indigenous industries. The United States should
recognize that European global competitiveness in the arms trade can
serve American interests (and perhaps provide competition for its own
sheltered defense industry). [This will relieve pressure on Europe to
export to countries embargoed by the United States, which undermines the
influence of U.S. arms transfer policy]{.underline}. When the United
States placed real restrictions on arms transfers to Egypt's al-Sisi
regime, other states quickly attempted to fill this gap. As one French
policymaker cynically noted, "Obama was the \[French fighter jet\]
Rafale's best salesperson." Overall, from 2012-2015 the export
agreements of major European sellers to Egypt have gone up
forty-seven-fold over the previous four-year period. That said, Europe
has by and large cooperated with successful arms embargoes against
Russia and China (although Europe does sell nearly \$400 million of dual
use equipment to China each year). Maintaining and even tightening these
key sanctions must be the highest priority of any defense cooperation
policy with Europe. More broadly, fixation on "buying American" misses
tremendous opportunities for leading coordinated action with like-minded
states in Europe and elsewhere. This is feasible given that the United
States, NATO members, South Korea, Israel, and a few other allies
account for a whopping 62 percent of total global arms exports (SIPRI).
To this end, the United States should liberalize its own market. Much as
when "foreign" automotive firms build their cars in the United States,
acquiring products from abroad may create more jobs than selling weapons
internationally. The U.S. Air Force's current \$16 billion
fighter-trainer contract has been largely narrowed down to three
candidates with foreign connections: a Lockheed Martin-Korea Aerospace
Industries version of Korea's T-50; a new design from a Boeing-Saab
team; and an entirely foreign offering from Leonardo. Winning such a
contract will give one of three like-minded states (South Korea, Sweden,
or Italy, respectively) a boost in other international competitions
against less scrupulous dealers. And the United States can still shape
these exports for its political interests, such as when it recently
vetoed the T-50's export to Uzbekistan. America is Like No Other Arms
Exporter and Should Act Like It [The United States --- by dint of its
huge military budget, massive defense R&D, and long dominance of the
global arms market --- can use arms transfers in ways beyond the dreams
of its competitors]{.underline}. Indeed, many competitors recognize
this, albeit grudgingly. I have interviewed officials in multiple
countries (both clients and competitors of the United States) claiming
they will defer to U.S. wishes on arms exports if they trust it is done
for political rather than economic reasons. [Many of America's closest
allies, who are also arms export competitors, look to the United States
for leadership on controversial importers such as Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}. And, the Trump administration should be given due
credit for exercising discretion, given, for instance, its recent
unilateral embargo on arms transfer to South Sudan. In fact, one
administration official stated flatly that sales "will not come at the
expense of human rights." In no small part, **[U.S. domination of the
global arms trade is based on the world's belief that the United States
uses its clout to advance its political ends, not economic
gain.]{.underline}** Destroying this reputation will do little to bring
jobs to the United States, while doing much to damage American influence
abroad.

[East Asian countries, with the exception of China]{.underline} --- and
perhaps Laos and Cambodia --- [look for U.S. leadership]{.underline}.
[They may posture and raise concerns, but they rely on the United States
for some semblance of stability and order. The United
States]{.underline}, regrettably, [is already beginning to squander
leadership. U.S. rejection of the Trans Pacific Partnership and the
"America first" policy, along with China's rise, is beginning to tilt
the balance toward China. That would increase, not decrease, instability
in the region]{.underline}. On the security front, [China's expansion of
its military presence in the South China Sea remains a source of
tension]{.underline}. On the more imminent and high-stakes issue of
North Korea, the United States and China have a shared interest in a
less provocative Kim Jong Un. The United States is hopeful that China
will help deescalate North Korea's aggressive stances, while China and
South Korea hope for a ratcheting down of divisive rhetoric on both
sides. All parties want to minimize tension and avoid military conflict,
but history has proven that the Korean peninsula and China will be the
nations impacted by a conflict between the United States and North
Korea, further incentivizing each nation's investment in maintaining
peace in the region. Kim's threats have moved the once conciliatory
President Moon Jae In a bit closer to President Trump's more hawkish
approach. At the same time, President Trump's hostility towards the
Korea-U.S. free trade agreement has created friction with this longtime
ally at a time of internal transition. [Instability threatens South
Korea's major economic driver]{.underline}, as well. The scandal that
rocked Samsung, South Korea's largest and most well-known family-run
conglomerate, has led to the perception that politics --- rather than
actual evidence --- dictated the administration of justice. Regardless
of the ultimate outcome, it is likely to complicate President Moon Jae
In's ambitious reform agenda. Indeed, a harsh and unfair penalty will
only provide a rare opportunity for Samsung's and Korea's competitors to
inflict damage to the company and the country. [If there is one thing
that businesses, and investors, hate, it is unpredictability. A
pragmatic approach to internal economics would help further South
Korea's stability and leadership in the region]{.underline}. In an
uncertain time, continuity should trump castigation --- South Korea
would do well with a pragmatic approach, rather than allowing emotions
or politics to lead to a punishment that "sends a message." [Steady U.S.
engagement with China, South Korea, and other Asian countries is more
important than ever]{.underline}. As chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, I led efforts to bring China into the World Trade
Organization. I believed then, and continue to believe, membership in
the WTO will nudge China toward acting as a leading stakeholder and
defender of a global trade system. [My three years as the U.S.
ambassador to China confirmed my sense that the Chinese are very clear
on their long-range aspirations to be a preeminent global
power]{.underline}. This has become even more obvious under President Xi
Jinping. Having visited every province in China and interacted with
business leaders across the country, [I know firsthand that the Chinese
will champion their industries and exploit weaknesses, whether it is
turmoil at Samsung or volatility in U.S. policy]{.underline}. When it
comes to their rational self-interest, the Chinese are unapologetic.
South Korea may want to take note, rather than undermining major
economic drivers. Samsung employs hundreds of thousands of people in
South Korea, and makes up 20 percent of the country's gross domestic
product. Instability at Samsung means instability for the entire South
Korean economy, and China is waiting in the wings to take advantage of
any such instability. President Trump's vow to open up the Korea-U.S.
Free Trade Agreement, if managed well, could improve our bilateral trade
ties. Both countries have an interest in the more balanced and mutually
beneficial relationship envisioned with the agreement. I supported the
Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, only after a struggle over Korea's
willingness to import U.S. beef. The hard work and compromise that went
into the agreement was worth it. Deepening and strengthening our trade
relationships in Asia is good for U.S. interests and the Korea-U.S. Free
Trade Agreement is a cornerstone of this strategy. It is essential for
maintaining U.S. credibility and reliability as a trading partner, and
can only be achieved when major corporations behave in rational,
predictable ways. [China's rapid ascent and its increasingly transparent
ambitions for global dominance, dangerous behavior by North Korea, and
an unfolding political and economic transition in South Korea are among
the many issues affecting U.S. interests in Asia. Only steady leadership
and close engagement with its allies will strengthen the America's hand
and advance our mutual interests in the region]{.underline}.

IN 1972 Anwar Sadat expelled Soviet military advisers from Egypt,
setting the stage for decades of American dominance, and much violent
disappointment, in the Middle East. In 2013 President Barack Obama
surrendered America's hegemony when he refused to take military action
against Syria's use of poison gas, and later sought a nuclear
accommodation with Iran. Donald [Trump]{.underline}, by contrast, has
lobbed missiles at Syria and menaced Iran. But as he [swings between
threatening to crush foes and getting out entirely, the latter instinct
will dominate]{.underline}. Sometimes events, his advisers or domestic
politics may compel him to take action. But Mr [Trump will mostly prove
even more detached than Mr Obama. That will make for unpredictability,
ineffectiveness and prolonged chaos. Partial accords might be negotiated
in Yemen, Syria and Libya, without finding lasting settlements to end
the wars. Mr Trump's "ultimate deal" of peace between Israel and the
Palestinians will be stillborn]{.underline}, if a plan emerges at all.
America's sanctions on Iran will not dislodge its clerical regime, and
will strengthen its hardliners. Jihadists will exploit any space to
regroup. In this free-for-all, [the danger of new wars will be
ever-present in 2019]{.underline}, if not by design then by mistake. The
shooting-down of a Russian spy plane in September, by Syrian air-defence
batteries taking aim at Israeli bombers, was a warning of how things can
go wrong when so many powers are fighting different wars at close
quarters. [One risk is of a war pitting Israel against Iran and its
allies,]{.underline} notably Hizbullah, the Lebanese Shia militia.
Another is of Turkey being drawn into fighting against Syrian forces
(and their Russian and Iranian allies) if they try to retake the
rebel-held enclave of Idlib. The politics of the Gulf will be jittery.
The macabre murder in October of Jamal Khashoggi, an exiled journalist,
has weakened King Salman of Saudi Arabia and his son, Muhammad, the
crown prince, on whom rested the hopes of social and economic reform.
That could lead to more repression, intensify palace intrigues and
deepen the country's cold war with Qatar and Turkey. Mr Trump's sympathy
for auto­cratic chums ultimately feeds instability, but he will worry
more about losing influence, and defence contracts, to Russia or China
Indeed, [Russia will increasingly cast itself as the indispensable power
in the Middle East]{.underline}. By intervening in Syria in 2015, Russia
saved the regime of Bashar al-Assad yet has so far avoided falling into
a quagmire of the sort that exhausted America in Iraq. [Russia has shown
that it will stand by its allies, no matter how repulsive. It has honed
its warfighting techniques, and has created a showcase for sales of
military equipment. Russia is the only country to enjoy friendly
relations with all the main regional players]{.underline}, among them
Israel, Turkey and, crucially, Iran. The key to any solution in Syria
will be in the hands of Russia, not America. [Even though Russia has
provided air power to the region's "Shia axis]{.underline}", Saudi
Arabia has co-operated with Russia to manage oil output and push up the
price of crude, to the ire of Mr Trump. [Israel, Saudi Arabia and
several Arab leaders have cheered Mr Trump at the risk of damaging
future rel­ations with America's Democrats]{.underline}. But [Gulf states
think he is a fickle friend]{.underline}, a fear heightened by Mr
Trump's warning that the Saudi king "might not be there for two weeks
without us". Russia thus provides a useful hedge against American
indifference. China is making inroads, too. It has a naval base in
Djibouti and its warships have called at Gulf ports. As the biggest
buyer of Gulf oil, it has a vital interest in the security of the
region. But China will mostly limit itself to pursuing economic deals.
[It will leave the maddening political and security problems
to]{.underline} America---or failing that, to [Russia]{.underline}.

[The rivalry between America and China has seen both sides step up

military ties with key allies]{.underline}, according to a report
published on Monday. The study by the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute ([SIPRI]{.underline}), which [examined the volume of
international transfers of major weapons between 2008 and 2017, showed
China's arms exports represented 5.7 per cent of the world's share of
arms exports between 2013-17]{.underline} -- up by more than a third
from the 4.6 per cent recorded between 2008-12. The report was published
a week after China unveiled an 8.1 per cent increase in military
spending over a three-year period, although China's state media defended
the rise as proportionate and low, adding that it would not lead to an
arms race with the United States. [The administration of US President

major arms to 48 countries in the past five years, with Pakistan topping
the list, followed by Bangladesh and Algeria. "[China was the largest
arms supplier to Pakistan in 2008--12 and 2013--17.]{.underline}
Although the volume of China's arms exports to Pakistan remained roughly
the same in both periods, its share of Pakistan's arms imports rose from
45 per cent in 2008--12 to 70 per cent in 2013--17 due to the overall
decrease in Pakistan's arms imports between those periods," the report
stated. China unhappy with US aircraft carrier's visit to Vietnam, state

from the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang
Technological University in Singapore, said higher value military items
like warships and fighter jets were the major reason for the rise in
China's arms exports. "[This is most notable in naval sales. For
example, submarines to Pakistan and Thailand, and corvettes to
Bangladesh and Algeria. Even with land-based systems, China has also
made inroads in higher value sales, such as its long-range rocket
artillery," he said.]{.underline}

#### Failure to balance China causes a resurgence in sphere of influence politics\-\--that collapses regional stability and economic globalization, causes nuclear proliferation and causes great power war.

[The liberal world order is under assault]{.underline}. Polls suggest an
American ambivalence about upholding the rules-based global system.
Populists are besieging governing elites in the West while Russia works
strategically to destabilize European and American governments through
propaganda and proxies. [A rising China wants to create a global system
that is not U.S.-centric, one in which smaller powers defer to bigger
ones and norms of democracy and rule of law do not prevail. Meanwhile,
the U.S. alliance system looks adrift while competitors in China and
Russia appear to be on the march. **If it holds, this trend could
produce a spheres-of-influence world**]{.underline} --- which many,
including the current presidents of the United States, China, and
Russia, find intuitively attractive. [**But were such an order to
replace one based on global integration and American leadership in the
geopolitical cockpits of Europe and Asia, it would only engender
insecurity and conflict.** In a spheres-of-influence world, great powers
order their regions. The United States would go back to a "Monroe
Doctrine" version of grand strategy; Russia would dominate the former
Soviet space; China would govern East Asia, and India South Asia. The
problem with this kind of order, however, is several-fold. **Too many
spheres overlap in ways that would generate conflict rather than clean
lines of responsibility**]{.underline}. [Japan would oppose Chinese
suzerainty in East Asia, including by developing nuclear weapons; India
and China would compete vigorously in Southeast Asia;]{.underline}
[Russia and China would contest the resources and loyalties of Central
Asia]{.underline}; [Europe and Russia would clash over primacy of
Central and Eastern Europe]{.underline}. [The Middle East would be an
even more likely arena for hot war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and
Turkey would contest regions also claimed by Russia, Europe, and
possibly China.]{.underline} Russia, like the Soviet Empire before it,
would keep pushing west until it met enough hard power to stop it. **[A
spheres of influence world would also sharpen great power competition
outside of each region]{.underline}**. [Regional hegemony is a
springboard for global contestation. **China would be more likely to
challenge the United States out-of-area if it had subdued strategic
competition in its own region.** Russia, like the Soviet Empire before
it, would keep pushing west until it met enough hard power to stop
it.]{.underline} (The fact that Russian troops marched through Paris
during the Napoleonic Wars demonstrates that the limits of Russian power
need not be confined to the former Warsaw Pact). American leaders have
long understood that a "Fortress America" approach is a source of
national insecurity. Franklin Roosevelt made this case in a series of
"fireside chats" in the run-up to America's participation in World War
II --- even before the advent of the far more sophisticated
power-projection technologies that exist today. Roosevelt and his
generals well understood that the United States could not be safe if
hostile powers controlled Europe and Asia, despite the wide oceans
separating North America from both theaters. [**A spheres-of-influence
world would also crack up the integrated global economy that underlies
the miracle in human welfare that has lifted billions out of poverty in
past decades. It would replicate the exclusive economic blocs of the
1930s, including an East Asia "co-prosperity sphere," seeding conflict
and undercutting prosperity.** A real-world and real-time example of
what happens when American power retreats in an effort to encourage
regional powers to solve their own problems is the mess in Syria. It has
produced the greatest refugee crisis since 1945 --- a stain on the
consciousness of human civilization --- and has led many to conclude
that the Middle Eastern order of states dating to the end of World War 1
is collapsing.]{.underline} President Obama pursued an express policy of
retracting American military power from the Middle East, including
withdrawing all troops from Iraq and refusing to intervene militarily
when President Assad used chemical weapons against his own people,
despite a red-line injunction from the United States not to do so. Obama
and his White House political advisors believed that American withdrawal
from the Arab Middle East (if not from the ironclad U.S. commitment to
Israel) would lead a new balance of power to form, one policed by
regional powers rather than by America. [This flawed, amoral, and
un-strategic approach has led to a series of hot wars --- in Syria,
Iraq, and Yemen --- the collapse of Arab allies' confidence in the
United States as an ally, as well as an intensified cold war with Iran.
Despite the international agreement freezing Iran's nuclear program,
Iran's support for terrorism and hostile insurgencies targeting American
allies across its region actually intensified during this period. **This
experience underlines a core problem with a spheres-of-influence world.
It leaves weaker states to become the victims of stronger or more
aggressive ones, and it seeds insecurity by removing the reassuring
variable of American military guarantees and presence. It emboldens
American adversaries and leads American allies to take self-help
measures that themselves may undercut American security
interests.**]{.underline} A [spheres-of-influence world would also
produce contestation of the open global commons that are the basis for
the unprecedented prosperity produced by the liberal international
economic order]{.underline}. [Should the Indian and Pacific Oceans, or
the Arctic and Mediterranean Seas, become arenas of great-power
conflict]{.underline} (like the South China Sea already has thanks to
China's militarization and unilateral assertion of sovereignty over it)
**[as leading states seek to incorporate them into their privileged
zones of control, economic globalization would collapse, harming the
economies of every major power.]{.underline}** The United States,
because of its sheer power and resource base as well as its relative
geographical isolation, might do OK in a spheres-of-influence world.
[Most of America's friends and allies would not. Their weakening and
insecurity would in turn render the United States weaker and more
insecure --- since U.S. allies are force-multipliers for American hard
and soft power, and since norms like freedom of the global commons are
in fact underwritten by that power. **More broadly, such a transition
would also likely lead to the kind of hot wars that reorder the
international balance of power, including by incentivizing aggressive
states to push out and assert regional dominion, knowing that America
does not have the will or interest to oppose them.**]{.underline}

ONG THE [Trump administration's most significant national security
decisions has been the shift from counterterrorism to inter-state
competition]{.underline}. [The United States is increasingly engaging in
global rivalry with "revisionist" states like China,]{.underline}
Russia, Iran and North Korea. To do this well, some U.S. policymakers
have argued that the United States needs to develop capabilities to
fight---and win---conventional and possibly even nuclear wars against
these states if deterrence fails. As the National Defense Strategy
argues, "The surest way to prevent war is to be prepared to win one.
Doing so requires a competitive approach to force development and a
consistent, multiyear investment to restore warfighting readiness and
field a lethal force." While there are good reasons to focus U.S.
national security on balancing against global and regional state
adversaries, it [would be a mistake to assume that most future conflict
will be conventional or even nuclear. It won't]{.underline}. [The United
States remains the world's preponderant military power]{.underline}.
[For]{.underline} Russia, Iran, North Korea and even
[China]{.underline}, [conventional or nuclear war with the United States
would be risky and prohibitively costly]{.underline}. What's more,
[America's struggles in Afghanistan and Iraq suggest that the U.S.
military is vulnerable when faced with adversaries that resort to
irregular strategies]{.underline}, operations and tactics. These
realities suggest that [competition between the United States and its
main adversaries will likely be irregular---not
conventional]{.underline}. Russia will likely continue to focus on a
suite of overt and covert actions, from supporting state and nonstate
proxies in Syria, Ukraine and potentially the Baltics to information
warfare. Iran will attempt to expand its power through proxies in
Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan and Bahrain---not by amassing a
more potent army, navy or air force capable of fighting conventional
battles against the United States. [China is already spreading its
influence in the Pacific by utilizing economic coercion, conducting a
sophisticated information campaign, and resorting to fishing vessels and
other "grey zone" tactics to lay claim to islands.]{.underline} Even
North Korea will likely continue to develop its special operations and
cyber capabilities. The future of conflict means that the United States
needs to prepare to compete with these states not primarily with
divisions, aircraft carriers and strategic bombers---but by, with, and
through state and nonstate proxies, cyber tools, and overt and covert
information campaigns. At the moment, however, the United States is
ill-prepared for irregular competition. WHILE THE United States needs to
prepare for the possibility of conventional and nuclear war, neither
will likely be the primary means of competition for at least two
reasons. First, the United States remains the dominant global military
power. Its defense budget is still larger than the defense budgets of
the next eleven countries in the world combined. More importantly, the
United States' land, air, naval, space and cyber capabilities are
formidable. [For]{.underline} Russia, Iran, North Korea and even [China,
conventional or nuclear war with the United States would be risky. The
gap between the United States and China, in particular, is narrowing.
Beijing is developing more accurate, long-range missiles; integrated air
defense; fourth-generation fighter aircraft; enhanced naval power
projection; more advanced space and counterspace capabilities; and
nuclear forces, including a new generation solid-propellant
intercontinental ballistic missile, the df-41.]{.underline} But U.S.
military capabilities surpass those of its competitors. econd, [the
costs of conventional and nuclear war are likely to be
staggering.]{.underline} Over the past several years, the U.S.
government and think tanks have conducted numerous wargames and analyses
of conflicts with Russia in the Baltics, China in the Taiwan Straits and
South China Sea, Iran in the Middle East and North Korea on the Korean
Peninsula. The [results are generally bleak. Most conclude that war
could lead to tens or hundreds of thousands of dead soldiers and
civilians, domestic unrest, billions of dollars in economic damages, a
global economic downturn and the potential collapse of long-held
alliances]{.underline}. In addition, [these conflicts might escalate to
nuclear war, raising the number of dead to millions of civilians, create
far-reaching environmental destruction and trigger unthinkable global
financial costs. A U.S. war with China could reduce China's gross
domestic product (GDP) by between 25 and 35 percent and the American GDP
by between 5 and 10 percent]{.underline}, according to a rand report. As
the report concluded: [A long and severe war could ravage China's
economy, stall its hard-earned development, and cause widespread
hardship and dislocation. Such economic damage could in turn aggravate
political turmoil and embolden separatists in China. Both the United
States and China would also suffer huge numbers of military and civilian
deaths and risk large-scale destruction of their military forces. If war
expanded to include their allies, economic and casualty figures would
skyrocket even further.]{.underline} Wargames that involve a conflict
between NATO and Russia, including scenarios with Russian forces
invading one or more Baltic countries, often escalate to include the
threat---or use---of tactical nuclear weapons. Even a conventional war
in the region could led to substantial destruction. If one or both sides
used nuclear weapons, the number of casualties would be virtually
unthinkable. hese costs and risks will likely give Washington, Moscow,
Beijing, Tehran and even Pyongyang pause. During the Cold War, Moscow
and Washington confronted a similar bleak reality, which meant that most
competition was irregular. THE COLD War offers a useful historical lens
to assess the risks of conventional and nuclear war between major
powers. NATO planners prepared for a possible Soviet and Warsaw Pact
invasion of Western Europe. The United States and other NATO countries
deployed forces close to the intra-German and Czech-German border to
stop Warsaw Pact forces from conducting an armored blitzkrieg into West
Germany. NATO also planned for nuclear war, limited or otherwise. The
United States amassed a vast nuclear arsenal and adopted strategies like
mutually assured destruction (MAD), which assumed that a full-scale use
of nuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would cause the
annihilation of both the attacker and the defender. The threat of such
heavy costs deterred conflict, despite some close calls. During the 1962
Cuban Missile Crisis, the United States and Soviet Union nearly went to
war after a U.S. U-2 aircraft took pictures of Soviet medium-range and
intermediate-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs and IRBMs) under
construction in Cuba. But Washington and Moscow ultimately assessed that
direct conflict was too costly. Deterrence held. Instead, the United
States and Soviet Union engaged in intense security competition at the
irregular level across Latin America, Africa, Asia and Europe. Both
countries backed nonstate groups and states to expand their power and
influence. Under the Reagan Doctrine, for example, the United States
provided overt and covert assistance to anti-Communist governments and
resistance movements to roll back Communist supporters across the globe.
For its part, Moscow adopted an aggressive, irregular approach best
captured in the Russian phrase aktivnyye meropriatia , or "active
measures." It involved overt and covert actions designed to influence
populations across the globe, from Europe and Asia to Latin America and
Africa. The kgb conducted disinformation campaigns using forgeries,
orchestrated political operations by recruiting or planting journalists
as agents of influence, supported front organizations in the West that
spread false information and lobbied in favor of pro-Soviet causes and
orchestrated targeted assassinations. The Soviets used active measures
as an offensive instrument of foreign policy to extend Moscow's
influence and undermine U.S. power throughout the world. George F.
Kennan argued that a significant component of U.S.-Soviet competition
could be characterized by what he called "political warfare." This type
of warfare refers to the employment of military, diplomatic,
intelligence and other means---short of conventional war---to achieve
national objectives. As Kennan argued, the tools of irregular warfare
range from such overt actions as political alliances, economic measures
(as \[the Marshall Plan\]), and "white" propaganda to such covert
operations as clandestine support of "friendly" foreign elements,
"black" psychological warfare and even encouragement of underground
resistance in hostile states. his type of irregular war was anything but
"cold." There were on average 180,000 deaths per year because of
insurgencies from 1950 to 1989, or approximately seven million dead.
Moscow and Washington aided rebels or governments in many of them.
TODAY, THE United States confronts multiple state adversaries---not one.
But U.S. policymakers have failed to learn important lessons from the
Cold War. The U.S. Air Force, Army, Navy and Marine Corps are
concentrating on developing forces, platforms, systems and capabilities
for conventional and nuclear war. Examples include longer-range
air-to-surface and air-to-air missiles, counterspace systems and
short-range air defense systems (SHORADs) for cruise missile defense
against China; heavy brigade combat teams and their sustainment for
Baltic scenarios against the Russians; high-capacity, close-in defenses
for surface vessels against Iran; and layered missile defense
capabilities against North Korea's ballistic missile program. The U.S.
military is also committed to modernizing the nuclear triad---strategic
bombers, intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and
submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). Professional military
education has shifted toward a focus on conventional and, to a lesser
degree, nuclear war. Some of these capabilities are clearly necessary.
But [based on the high costs of conventional and nuclear
war]{.underline}, most U.S. [competition]{.underline} [with]{.underline}
Russia, [China]{.underline}, North Korea and Iran [will likely be
irregular]{.underline}. [The United States is vulnerable. Just look at
Afghanistan, where the Taliban has fought the United States to a
stalemate despite lacking the U.S.'s high-tech weapons]{.underline}.
Instead, [the Taliban]{.underline}---which receives some support from
Pakistan, Iran and even Russia---[has focused on guerrilla tactics like
ambushes, raids, suicide attacks and targeted
assassinations.]{.underline} The U.S. [military has struggled against
poorly-equipped insurgent groups in Iraq, Libya and Somalia, just to
name a few other examples. U.S. adversaries have noticed.]{.underline}
Russia employs a mix of technologically-sophisticated offensive cyber
capabilities, covert action, and information operations to expand its
power and compete with the United States. Moscow has implemented overt
information campaigns using platforms like RT and Sputnik. It has also
conducted covert campaigns to support influential figures and opposition
political parties in Western and Eastern Europe; waged offensive cyber
campaigns against the United States, France, Germany and other NATO
countries; and supported state and nonstate proxies in Ukraine, Libya,
Syria and Afghanistan to increase its power in Europe, Asia, the Middle
East and even Africa. Russia's approach involves the use of high volumes
of information, provided rapidly, repetitively, and without a commitment
to objectivity and facts. In short, Moscow has warmly embraced the tous
azimuts use of irregular warfare. Iran possesses formidable irregular
capabilities led by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps--Quds Force
(IRGC-QF), the special forces unit of the IRGC responsible for
international operations. Iran has adopted a strategy of "forward
defense," which involves supporting sub-state proxies across the Middle
East and beyond. The Islamic Republic has used local militias, employed
religious ideology to recruit and inspire militants, utilized economic
influence as a means of political leverage, engaged in psychological
warfare to promote the Islamic revolution's ideology, and engaged in
cultural and religious diplomacy efforts. Iran's proxies, for example,
play a prominent role in Tehran's irregular warfare strategy. The
IRGC-QF is responsible for training pro-Iranian militants across the
Middle East and beyond in countries like Lebanon, Syria, Afghanistan,
Iraq and Yemen. Iran has encouraged militias to establish political
organizations, with Lebanese Hezbollah serving as the most successful
example. At the same time, Iran backs competing militias to provide it
with strategic options and to prevent any one group from becoming too
powerful. In addition, Iran has developed substantial cyber
capabilities. It has penetrated U.S. and allied networks to conduct
espionage for future cyberattacks. Tehran likely views cyberattacks as a
versatile tool to respond to perceived provocations. Iran's cyberattacks
against Saudi Arabia in late 2016 and early 2017 involved data deletion
on dozens of networks across government and the private sector. [China
has used fleets of fishing vessels and created artificial islands by
dumping millions of tons of sand and concrete onto reefs to assert its
territorial and resource claims in the Pacific]{.underline}. [Beijing
has]{.underline} also [utilized economic inducements and coercion,
aggressive cyber activity by government and nonstate hacktivists, and
covert support to foreign government officials to expand its power and
influence]{.underline}. [While China is modernizing its army, air force
and navy, much of its activity will likely be irregular warfare. In a
concept known as the "three warfares,"]{.underline} [the Chinese
Community Party and People's Liberation Army have focused on improving
China's propaganda, psychological operations and "lawfare"---the use of
law as a weapon of warfare.]{.underline} Even North Korea has developed
irregular capabilities. It has conducted offensive cyberattacks against
corporations like Sony and countries like South Korea, as well as
orchestrated broader attacks like the WannaCry ransomware campaign that
crippled hospitals, banks and other companies across the globe in 2017.
North Korea is also developing more robust special operations
capabilities, including establishing forward-deployed hovercraft bases
closer to South Korean islands in the West Sea for possible clandestine
activity. More broadly, the North Korean leadership has focused on
developing special forces, chemical weapons, and biological weapons and
delivery systems. In fact, North Korea's special forces are among the
largest in the world and could greatly complicate any conflict by
striking behind South Korean lines in "second front" operations. North
Korea has a robust inventory of chemical weapons, estimated at
2,500--5,000 metric tons of chemical agents. [America's adversaries are
unlikely to compete with the United States directly in a series of
set-piece battles.]{.underline} Instead, **[they will likely continue to
engage in cyber, proxy and information campaigns]{.underline}**. Thus
far, [the United States has failed to compete effectively in this
field]{.underline}, except for some efforts by U.S. special operations
forces. [Washington has been far too reactive, defensive, and
cautious]{.underline}---not to mention discordant among multiple U.S.
government agencies

**[Abdication is not isolationism]{.underline}**. Donald **[Trump's
United States is not isolationist]{.underline}**. [He has authorized the
use of limited military force against the Syrian government in a manner
his predecessor rejected. U.S. military operations have gone a long way
toward defeating ISIS in both Syria and Iraq]{.underline}. [The Trump
administration might employ force against Iran or North Korea, or both,
and has pressed for and secured new international sanctions against the
latter]{.underline}. It could well act (most likely unilaterally) in the
economic realm, applying tariffs or sanctions as it sees fit against one
or another trading partner. [It is trying its hand (thus far **without
success**) at mediating several disputes in the Middle
East]{.underline}. The U.S. military effort in Afghanistan is to be
extended and possibly augmented. But **[abdication describes U.S.
foreign policy all the same, as the United States is no longer taking
the lead in maintaining alliances, or in building regional and global
institutions that set the rules for how international relations are
conducted]{.underline}**. It is abdication from what has been a position
of leadership in developing the rules and arrangements at the heart of
any world order. For three-quarters of a century, from World War II
through the Cold War and well into the post--Cold War era, the United
States was the principal architect and builder of global rules. This is
not to say that the United States always got it right; it most certainly
did not, at times because of what it did, at other times because of what
it chose not to do. [But more often than not, the United States played a
large, mostly constructive, and frequently generous role in the
world]{.underline}. [Under Donald Trump, however, U.S. foreign policy
shows clear signs of significant departure]{.underline}. [Support for
alliances, embrace of free trade, concern over climate change,
championing of democracy and human rights, American leadership per
se---these and other fundamentals of American foreign policy have been
questioned and, more than once, rejected]{.underline}. Trump is the
first post--World War II American president to view the burdens of world
leadership as outweighing the benefits. As a result, **[[the United
States has changed from the principal preserver of order to a principal
disrupter]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[This [change has major
implications]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[It will make it far more
difficult to deal with the challenges posed by globalization]{.mark},
[including]{.mark} climate change [and nuclear proliferation]{.mark}, to
regulate cyberspace on terms compatible with American interests, or to
help relieve the plight of refugees on terms consistent with American
values]{.underline}**. [It will make it more difficult to build
frameworks that promote trade and investment and to ensure that the
United States benefits from them]{.underline}. The process of pulling
back began in the opening minutes of Donald Trump's presidency, in his
inaugural address. The new president espoused a doctrine of "America
First," suggesting that for decades what the United States had spent and
done abroad had been to America's domestic detriment, and that the
United States would no longer put the interests of others ahead of its
own. [The focus was on sovereign rights, not obligations, and on
promoting national recovery rather than international
order]{.underline}. Not surprisingly, this message was not well received
by [**[American allies]{.underline}**,]{.mark} who **[[have made the
strategic decision to place the]{.mark} lion's [share of their security
and well-being in American hands and were taken aback by the notion that
their interests would be relegated to second
place]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [It is important to keep in mind that
alliances are important both for what they do---**they pool resources on
behalf of shared goals and defense---and what they discourage, including
proliferation and deferring to adversaries**]{.underline}[. [Attempts
by]{.underline}]{.mark} [two of Mr[. Trump's top **aides** to smooth
matters did not succeed]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Their
statement]{.mark}---appearing in the form of a Wall Street Journal op-ed
in late May---that "America First does not mean America alone[" was
inconsistent with their description of the world as a Hobbesian arena
where nations, nongovernmental actors, and businesses engage and compete
for advantage]{.mark}. **[This expression of pure realism was at odds
with the essence of alliances (best understood as strategic
relationships) in which long-term commitments and shared interests take
precedence over particular interactions or transactions and short-term
considerations]{.underline}**. Mr. Trump's own subsequent effort at the
United Nations in September to portray America First as nothing
different from the priority any leader would accord his country
similarly failed to assuage concerns for the simple reason that the
United States has a role in the world that is unlike that of any other
country. [The inaugural address was also explicitly
protectionist]{.underline}---including a call to "Buy American and Hire
American." Within days, Donald Trump translated these words into policy
when he took the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership
(TPP), the 12-nation trade pact that had been painstakingly negotiated
among governments representing some 40 percent of global GDP. While far
from perfect---the TPP did not provide mechanisms for addressing
currency manipulation or state subsidies or forced transfers of
technology---it represented a major advance over existing trade pacts
and would have increased American access to the markets of others, most
of whom already enjoyed tariff-free access to the U.S. market. It also
provided a foundation for future innovations that could promote and
protect U.S. interests. [Trade accords had been a staple of the
post--World War II world, providing a mechanism for economic growth,
development, and association with friends and allies, and a means of
**reining in would-be adversaries who otherwise would have little
incentive to act with restraint**]{.underline}. Walking away from the
TPP was thus inconsistent with American economic and strategic interests
alike. The decision also ignored the reality that it is not trade but
innovation and productivity enhancements that account for the lion's
share of recent job disappearance. Over the ensuing months, [**[the new
president distanced himself further from many of the country's
allies]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [He neglected to reiterate U.S. adherence
to **Article 5 of the NATO treaty** (which underscores that an attack on
one is an attack on all, triggered only once, in the wake of the 9/11
attacks on the United States)]{.underline} when speaking in Europe in
May; instead, the speech included several statements pressing the allies
to spend and do more on defense. [The overall effect was to make the
U.S. commitment to Europe's security appear conditional]{.underline}.
The president's subsequent articulation (in Warsaw in July) of the U.S.
commitment to Article 5 was a classic case of too little, too late.
Moreover, public criticism by President Trump of South Korea, over both
the terms of the bilateral trade pact and its alleged "appeasement" of
North Korea, reinforced the notion that alliances and long-term
relationships counted for little. Just as significant was the decision
announced in June that the United States intended to leave the Paris
climate pact. This was an odd decision on the merits, as the agreement
constituted a form of multilateralism that left all discretion with
sovereign governments rather than with any supranational authority. The
decision to leave raised questions (coming as it did on the heels of the
decision to leave the TPP) about the continued willingness of the United
States to play a role in upholding global order. Such questions
increased in the wake of the December 2017 U.S. boycott of the Mexico
City meeting convened to promote international cooperation on migration.
**[[The net result was to give the United States a reputation for
parochialism and unreliability]{.mark}, something inconsistent with its
role as an ally and its hard-earned reputation for global
leadership]{.underline}**. [It is strangely reminiscent of the dictum of
the 19th-century British statesman Lord Palmerston: "We have no eternal
allies, and we have no perpetual enemies. Our interests are eternal and
perpetual, and those interests it is our duty to follow."]{.underline}
[One could almost imagine Mr. Trump tweeting a version of the
above]{.underline}. [Making matters worse were **proposed budget cuts
and unfilled posts at home and overseas that reduced the resources
essential for an active diplomacy**]{.underline}. [It added up to what
appeared to be a doctrine of withdrawal]{.underline}. Barack Obama,
often reluctant to make large commitments, never could shed the
oxymoronic description of his foreign policy as "Leading from Behind."
For Donald Trump, the tagline might well be "Leaving from Behind." U.S.
standing in the world also suffered for other reasons. It was fine, as
the president said in his speech to the United Nations in September,
that the United States would not impose its way of life on others. But
less clear is the country's continuing ability to "shine as an example
for everyone to watch." One of the most important mechanisms for
influence is the example set by what goes on inside this country:
politically, economically, and socially. But [**political dysfunction
and pronounced division reduce the appeal of American democracy**, while
the government's ability to advocate for democracy is further set back
by President Trump's attacks on courts and media]{.underline}. **[Social
fissures, stagnating incomes, high inequality, increasing national debt
(to be exacerbated by the tax cut) and violence likewise have taken
their toll on respect for this country and what it stands
for]{.underline}**. [Much the same can be said about a much-reduced U.S.
willingness to accept refugees in general, and from certain
predominantly Muslim countries in particular]{.underline}. It is
impossible to know whether what we have witnessed to date is something
of an aberration or a new normal. In principle, Mr. Trump could evolve
or, even if not, his successor could embrace a more familiar foreign
policy. But **[it is also possible that Mr. Trump will be a two-term
president and that his successor will embrace at least some of his
approach to foreign policy]{.underline}**. **[Regardless, the world that
either a reformed President Trump or a successor would inherit is
already one of increasing disarray]{.underline}**. [It is also far from
assured that other governments would ever again see the United States
the same way in that, if such a radical departure could happen once, it
could happen a second time]{.underline}. This raises a larger, related
point. **[There must be a presumption of continuity in the foreign
policy of a great power if allies are to remain allied and if foes are
to be deterred]{.underline}**. [Unpredictability may on occasion make
sense as a tactic, but not as a strategy]{.underline}. [The many
departures introduced or threatened by the Trump administration (most
recently extending to both the NAFTA agreement and the 2015 nuclear
accord with Iran) create **doubts as to U.S. reliability**]{.underline}.
This is not meant as an argument for standing pat in foreign policy. The
world is changing and U.S. foreign policy must change with it. **[The
argument, though, is that the international project should be a
renovation based on the existing order, not a teardown]{.underline}**.
It needs pointing out that to recognize [the revival of great-power
rivalry, a prominent theme of the recently released National Security
Strategy, provides little in the way of policy guidance]{.underline}.
**[Countering Russian or Chinese challenges is necessary but not
sufficient; doing so will not position the United States to meet
regional and global challenges to its interests]{.underline}**. **[What
is required is the forging of effective collective responses, if need be
without Russia and China, when possible with them]{.underline}**. The
question naturally arises as to whether such a world could come about
without the leadership of the United States, and in particular without
the enthusiastic backing of the president and the executive branch. An
optimist would argue that it could, that others in the United States and
around the world would take up the slack. Alas, such optimism is mostly
unwarranted. It is true that **[Congress can do some
things]{.underline}**, such as introduce sanctions. **[It can also
reject appointments, review treaties, hold hearings that shape public
opinion, and withdraw or add funding]{.underline}**. In addition, states
and cities can do a good deal to offset executive disinterest in
adopting policies to slow and adapt to climate change.

Don't let the title fool you: Eliot A. Cohen's newest book, "The Big
Stick: The Limits of Soft Power and the Necessity of Military Force,"
isn't a pro-war polemic. Instead, it's very much in the "older, sadder,
wiser" vein: Once seen as a cheerleader for the George W. Bush
administration's ambitious neo-conservative agenda, Cohen now offers a
vision of American power largely stripped of illusion. **[The United
States must enhance its military capabilities and remain engaged in
shoring up the international order]{.underline}**, he contends in this
thoughtful and erudite book --- [but not because it is
infallible.]{.underline} It's simply that [in this messy and uncertain
world, **there are currently no better alternatives**]{.underline}.¶
Even though Cohen is passionate about a United States that is militarily
powerful and internationally engaged, he is also a student of history,
and for the most part, he owns up to recent U.S. failures. [In Iraq and
Afghanistan, the United States was "unprepared, intellectually and
organizationally."]{.underline} It made "fundamental misjudgments," and
the military adapted only haltingly and intermittently to the new forms
of conflict it faced. Ultimately, Cohen concludes, the Iraq War, which
he once staunchly supported, was "a mistake." False intelligence about
weapons of mass destruction damaged U.S. credibility, as did the abuses
at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere. More broadly, the war strained
civil-military relations, caused tensions with key U.S. allies and left
the United States weaker rather than stronger.¶ Cohen is equally
critical of American military and political leaders. Enamored of Special
Operations forces and drone strikes, [U.S. policymakers have confused
tactical success with strategic progress, and the military has failed to
invest in "the intellectual infrastructure" of hard power and to develop
innovative new ways to bring in vital talent.¶]{.underline} Why, then,
should the flawed and error-prone United States not simply cultivate its
own garden, reserving the use of military force for narrow, defensive
purposes?¶ Cohen has an answer, and it's far from triumphalist: We live
in a country that has been continuously at war for the past 15 years and
continually at war throughout its history, and we belong to a species
that seems uniquely prone to bouts of mass slaughter. As Leon Trotsky is
said to have remarked, "[You may not be interested in war, but war is
interested in you.]{.underline}" If we take that seriously, [the United
States needs to be engaged in the ongoing project of shoring up the
international order it helped create, and it needs to accept that there
may be times when political leaders will conclude]{.underline}, "however
reluctantly, [that violence is the least bad policy
choice."¶]{.underline} That international order (and the American
interests it protects) faces four main challenges. The first is China.
**[China's worldview is fundamentally incompatible with that of the
United States]{.underline}**, Cohen asserts. [In the South China Sea,
for instance, "China has made claims that would not only deny other
countries access to the riches of the seabed, but would, by constraining
commerce, render them vassals to their giant neighbor."]{.underline}
More broadly, [China]{.underline} refuses to "recognize a state system
based on equality and sovereignty, and an economic system built around
globalized free trade supported by the rule of law." Instead, "it [has a
hierarchical conception of **i**nternational
**r**elations]{.underline}."¶ China, one supposes, might say the same of
the United States. Still, Cohen is surely right that [China's recent
attempt to claim most of the South China Sea as part of its territorial
waters runs afoul of international law and greatly increases the risk of
international conflict]{.underline}. "[War]{.underline}," Cohen notes,
"[may come without either side willing it from the
beginning]{.underline}"; even **[an "accidental or nearly accidental
clash between American and Chinese forces" could quickly spiral into
overt conflict]{.underline}**, and there is no guarantee that the United
States would emerge victorious.¶ **[Washington]{.underline}**, Cohen
contends, **[must therefore "convince \[this\] rising, assertive and yet
vulnerable peer" that attacks on its neighbors or on the United States
would "not only fail, but endanger the regime that launched
them,"]{.underline}** [something that can "only be accomplished by an
American force structure, alliance system, and mobilization capacity
that makes such attacks self-evidently unwise."¶]{.underline} Cohen sees
a second challenge to U.S. interests in the behavior of **[powerful
nuclear and near-nuclear states such as Russia, Iran and North Korea.
Each aims to change regional balances of power in ways that could
trigger widespread conflict, and]{.underline}** each, he argues, **[can
be deterred only by clear evidence that the United States will, if
necessary, respond to aggressive or destabilizing actions with decisive
force.¶]{.underline}** In Cohen's eyes, a third threat is posed by the
"various jihadi movements --- al-Qaeda, the Islamic State, al-Shabaab,
Boko Haram, and others." Traditional models of deterrence have little to
offer when it comes to ideologically motivated, violent nonstate actors,
and the United States has struggled both to define and to respond to
these nontraditional foes. On the one hand, such extremist groups pose
no existential threat to the United States; on the other hand, they
can't merely be ignored. Cohen advocates a combination of "lethal
operations . . . to tamp down, disrupt, and limit a virus that cannot,
however, be destroyed this way"; a focus on capturing "and where
possible, turning" leading terrorists; and a greatly expanded effort to
harness American "soft power" to counter extremist ideologies.¶ Finally,
"The Big Stick" turns to the challenges posed by ungoverned spaces and
the global commons. Here, [there is often no "enemy" but rather a
compelling U.S. interest in ensuring that the world's trouble spots
don't boil over]{.underline}. [The **refugee** flows engendered by
Syria's civil war are destabilizing Europe; internal conflicts in
**Yemen**, **Iraq** and a dozen other places also threaten regional
stability.]{.underline} Similarly, [tensions over access to and control
of the **oceans**, over the potentially vast resources beneath the
melting polar **ice caps**, over **outer space**, and over
**cyberspace** could easily escalate.]{.underline} Complex as they are,
Cohen insists, **["in all these dimensions of ungoverned space and the
commons," American "military power remains the ultimate guarantor that
the diverse great commons of mankind remain accessible to
all."]{.underline}**¶ In some ways, "The Big Stick" is less a defense of
the continued relevance of hard power than a broadside against various
dangerous illusions. Cohen is scathing, for instance, toward Steven
Pinker, Francis Fukuyama and all those inclined to dismiss the 20th
century's brutal world wars as mere random blips in a long-term trend
toward peace: ["If the world's randomness is such that it can produce
slaughter on such an epic scale,"]{.underline} he asks, "[why should we
be any less fearful of it in today's world --- a world with far better
tools for inflicting mass death?]{.underline}" He is equally savage
regarding those who imagine that the use of force can ever be fully
predictable or controlled. To Cohen, those who speak of [**"containment,
end state, and exit strategy" are merely sprinkling "a kind of strategic
pixie dust" over complex problems, deluding themselves into thinking of
war as "a kind of engineering enterprise," rather than "a contest of
opposing wills conducted in the murk of politics," subject**, like
everything in human affairs, **to "accident, contingency, and
randomness."**]{.underline}¶ No question, U.S. efforts to serve as the
guarantor of world order have frequently been characterized by failure
and incompetence --- but, Cohen reminds us, "[failure and incompetence
are more the norm in international politics than success and
skill]{.underline}," and in any case, as Syria and a multitude of other
tragedies demonstrate, "**[the perils of inaction . . . can be as great
as those of action]{.underline}**."¶ In a dangerous and uncertain world,
he concludes, [the best we can do is acknowledge how very little we know
and try to build a military and a society capable of rapid adaptation to
challenges we can barely anticipate, much less control.]{.underline} To
those who ask, "**[Why the United States]{.underline}**?" Cohen offers
an implicit challenge: **[Who else]{.underline}**?

#### Pursuit of heg inevitable and Trump doesn't change it

**Carafano 17** (James Jay, Heritage Foundation vice president, "The
Most Shocking Thing about Trump So Far: How Boring He\'s Been", National
Interest, 3/13,

Rather than turn the world upside down, Donald [**Trump might do little
more than sustain and stabilize the liberal order** that emerged after
World War II.¶]{.underline} That will shock those who expect the new
president to shock the world. Their predictions range from hot wars to
reckless acts of statecraft to utter isolationism. But [presidential
rhetoric aside, the early signs suggest **Trump is pursuing a defense
and foreign policy that looks tediously mainstream**.¶]{.underline} And
[that's a good thing]{.underline}. Defying his critics' expectations,
[Trump could become the steadying influence the world needs right
now.¶]{.underline} Decoding Presidential Doctrine¶ [**An understanding
of executive doctrine emerges when we analyze the actions taken in
office rather than the rhetoric spoken there or on the campaign trail**,
and when we accept the fact that doctrine often evolves.¶]{.underline}
The Clinton worldview of engagement and enlargement evolved from the
president's effort to craft something to replace Cold War containment.
The Bush Doctrine was largely shaped by the events of 9/11.¶ In 2009, it
was impossible to predict---from listening to Obama's campaign
speeches---the kind of foreign policy the new president would pursue.
Heritage Foundation scholars had to wait almost two years before they
were confident they had enough data to identify the trends that defined
the Obama Doctrine.¶ Discerning the direction of Trump's foreign policy
may require even more caution. Instant analysis is rarely accurate, and
this president's rhetoric---both before and after the election---was
often overwhelming and distracting. [A vigorous debate can be had over
what Trump's tweets are. What they are not are the elements of foreign
and defense policy]{.underline}.¶ Even reading fulsome treatments by
members of the president's team offers only so many clues. Before he
took on his duties as deputy assistant to the president for strategic
communications in the National Security Council, Michael Anton wrote a
long piece on the future prospects for the liberal international order.
"Trump's campaign was driven by the basic awareness of ordinary citizens
that American peace, prestige, and prosperity were not being served by
our foreign policy," he asserted, adding that [Trump "seems to
understand that correcting the errors of the neo-interventionists does
not require adopting those of the paleo-isolationists."]{.underline} He
made Trump sound more like a tinkerer than a demolition man.¶ Still, the
words of one advisor are just more drops in the bucket of administration
rhetoric. In fact, suggesting that the president plans to hold the
middle ground between invading every country and sitting on his hands
doing nothing echoes the promises made by Obama when he scooped up his
2009 Nobel Peace Prize.¶ Tour du Trump¶ Rather than look at words,
[let's examine Trump's first cut at actions to determine where the
administration is headed.¶]{.underline} [Hard vs. Soft Power: Clearly,
Trump wants both and is happy with neither]{.underline}. On the
statecraft side, draft budgets reportedly call for real reductions in
the State Department and foreign aid. But that is not to say he is soft
on soft power. [Lopping off all of Obama's pet progressive projects
would yield substantial savings at State without compromising the
department's core missions that address the issues of war and
peace]{.underline}. In the end, [budgets would look much like they did
in the Bush years]{.underline}---which, by the way, saw substantial
growth from 2000 to 2008.¶ On the hard-power side, [Trump acknowledges
that defense has been underfunded]{.underline}. The military faces a
readiness crisis, so [the downward trend in military spending must be
reversed. **That's not warmongering**.]{.underline} The service chiefs
have presented plenty of quantitative evidence that the U.S. military
lacks the capacity and capability to adequately defend America's vital
interests. The Heritage Foundation's 2016 Index of U.S. Military
Strength rates the current armed forces as "marginal."¶ Some have
criticized Trump for trying to rebuild the military, but [the more
accurate critique might argue for even more aggressive reinvestment in
the military]{.underline}. Trump is said to be seeking a 2018 defense
budget of \$603 billion. Heritage recommended a \$632 billion
budget---even after identifying \$14 billion in savings.¶ [Trump also
looks to be looking for balance in leadership]{.underline}. His
**[secretaries of defense and state have both made high-profile visits
around the world reassuring allies that the U.S. will maintain its
commitments to friends and allies]{.underline}**. Both have the
president's respect and confidence. Further, the [appointment of H. R.
McMaster as National Security Advisor has drawn bipartisan---almost
universal---praise.¶]{.underline} What could be more mainstream than a
peace-through-strength strategy that promises to be a good friend to our
friends and a fearsome opponent to our unfriendly competitors? Now, the
administration can shore up confidence that it has the right balance by
speeding the appointment of competent, seasoned national-security
professionals to fill out the president's team.¶ Europe: Most notable
about Trump's policies is what the administration has not done. [The
White House has not called for ending sanctions against
Russia]{.underline}---the right call, because Putin has not honored
commitments under the Minsk agreement. **[The administration has not
distanced itself from Ukraine or pared back the joint military
deployments on NATO's frontier]{.underline}**. Nor has it shown any
interest in trimming missile-defense plans or the NATO reassurance
initiative. All these "non-actions" pair well with the many reassuring
statements that senior U.S. officials, and the president himself, have
made about America's continued commitment to the alliance.¶ Of course
the administration can send even more reassuring signals. It could
announce a proactive policy of support for Ukraine. It could exercise
some leadership in the Balkans, where the EU has clearly dropped the
ball. It could throw support behind central European energy and economic
programs, which would make the region less susceptible to Russian
meddling. It could press the Congress to ratify the accession of
Montenegro to NATO.¶ Still, for now it is clear that [the administration
is interested in the peace and security of Europe]{.underline}. It is
hard to be more mainstream than that.¶ Middle East: [Trump is committed
to the defeat of ISIS and Al Qaeda,]{.underline} and to keeping
transnational terrorist threats from coming to American shores. That
hardly seems off the reservation for U.S. policy. Further, once the
rhetoric is stripped away, it is clear that [these
policies]{.underline}, like his controversial executive order, [are
focused on providing security, not demonizing the Muslim
world.¶]{.underline} Trump has also signaled that [he interested in
restraining Iran]{.underline}. That, too, was standard operating
procedure for U.S. foreign policy until Barack Obama entered the Oval
Office.¶ For sure there is much more to be done. Topping the list:
dealing with the disaster in Syria.¶ Far East: Trump has jettisoned the
Blazing Saddles policy towards China. Instead of "Don't shoot Mongo; you
might make him mad," [the administration seems happy to bump against the
Chinese across the spectrum of military, economic and political
affairs]{.underline}.¶ Again, the reassuring to-do list in Asia is long.
That starts with a sustainable, realistic plan to deal with North Korea.
But for now, [the bold assertion of America's rights in the region is
frankly are far more mainstream than what we got from our last two
presidents]{.underline}.

### 2nc -- multipolarity not possible 

#### Hege now -- multipolarity not possible 

**Kortunov 18** (Dr. Andrey KORTUNOV Director General of the Russian
International Affairs Council. June 28, 2018 Why the World is Not
Becoming Multipolar
https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2018/06/28/why-the-world-is-not-becoming-multipolar/)
\[Twinz\]

Elusive Multipolarity In October 2016, twenty years after Yevgeny
Primakov' policy article was published in the journal International
Affairs, President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin gave a
speech at the Annual Meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi,
during which he commented, "I certainly hope that... the world really
will become more multipolar, and that the views of all actors in the
international community will be taken into account." Six months prior to
that, [Putin noted the role of the United States in international
relations: "America is a great power, today perhaps the only superpower.
We accept this." That is, even though a multipolar world is the
desirable world system, presently it is too early to say that the
"unipolar moment" has been completely overcome]{.underline}. Minister of
Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Sergey Lavrov, following the
general logic and even the style of Yevgeny Primakov's narrative of 20
years ago, also spoke about the start of a transition to multipolarity
and the completion of the process in some indefinite future: "... [A
change of eras is always a lengthy process. It will continue for a long
tim]{.underline}e." As an additional complication, Lavrov emphasized the
staunch resistance of the proponents of the old world order: "[There are
active attempts to hinder the process primarily on the part of those who
used to dominate the world, who wish to preserve their domination in new
conditions as well, and, generally speaking, to enshrine their
domination forever]{.underline}." This logic is hard to dispute. Yet
some questions remain. First, [the historical experience of the previous
centuries offers no examples of an old world gradually transforming into
a new one over time. The changes in the world order that took place in
1815, 1919, and 1945 were not evolutionary, but imposed by revolutionary
(forcible) means and stemmed from large-scale armed conflicts that had
preceded them]{.underline}. [The new world order was always built by the
victors in their own interests]{.underline}. Of course, we may suppose
that humanity has become wiser and more humane over the last 100--200
years, though not everyone would agree. Yet even if that is true,
[surely all attempts to "gradually" transition to a multipolar world
would be the same as trying to alleviate the pain of a beloved pet dog
by cutting off its tail piece by piece]{.underline}. Second, [if we take
as given that the transition to a multipolar world will become an
extended process spread over, say, five decades (1995--2045), this leads
to the depressing conclusion that humanity will remain in the "grey
area" between the old and new world orders until the middle of the 21st
century]{.underline}. This "grey area" is clearly not a particularly
comfortable or safe place. [It is easy to predict that it will lack
clear rules of the game, understandable and generally recognized
principles of the functioning of the international system, and numerous
conflicts between the emerging "poles." The system may even split into
individual fragments and its "poles" will become self-isolated in their
regional or continental subsystems]{.underline}. Can we afford several
decades in the "grey zone" without subjecting humanity to extreme risks?
Third, [do we even have sufficient grounds to say that the world is
moving towards multipolarity, even if this movement is slow,
inconsistent, and sporadic? Could we, for instance, conclude that today,
the European Union is closer to being a full-fledged and independent
global "pole" than it was ten years ago? Can we assert that, over the
last decade, Africa, the Middle East, or Latin America have made
significant progress towards the status of a collective
"pole]{.underline}"? Is it possible to say that as the Shanghai
Cooperation Organisation (SCO) expanded, the group increased its
capability to act on a consolidated stance on the international stage?
[If we are not yet prepared to give an unequivocal "yes" to all these
questions, then we do not have the right to say that the world is
steadily moving towards multipolarity]{.underline}. Over the years,
[multipolarity has become like a distant horizon that keeps receding as
we move towards it]{.underline}. Could we not, therefore, apply Eduard
Bernstein's famous saying that "the movement is everything, the final
goal is nothing" to multipolarity? That is, could we perceive
multipolarity not as a full-fledged alternative to the existing world
order, but as a mechanism for correcting the weakest and most vulnerable
elements of this order? "The Concert of Europe" 200 Years On Adherents
of multipolarity like to cite the "Concert of Europe," the Vienna System
of international relations established in Europe in the early 19th
century after the Napoleonic wars. This system was truly multipolar; it
did indeed help preserve peace in Europe for a long time. Historians
debate the precise date at which the system collapsed: 1853 (the start
of the Crimean War), 1871 (the Franco-Prussian War) or 1914 (the First
World War). In any case, after 1815, the 19th century was relatively
peaceful for Europe, particularly when compared to the disastrous 20th
century. [Could the "Concert of Europe" be repeated 200 years later,
this time in the global, rather than the European, context]{.underline}?
Let us start with the fact that [the members of the "Concert of Europe,"
despite being very different states, were still comparable in power and
influence militarily, politically, and economically]{.underline}. The
cosmopolitan European elites remained largely homogeneous (European
monarchies in the 19th century were essentially one extended family),
spoke the same language (French), professed the same faith
(Christianity), and were in general part of the same cultural tradition
(the European Enlightenment). Of even greater importance is the fact
that [the members of the "Concert of Europe" did not have radical,
irreconcilable differences in their views on the desirable future of
European politics, at least until the rapid rise of Prussia and the
subsequent unification of Germany]{.underline}. [Today, the situation is
drastically different. The potential members of a unipolar system have
fundamentally different political weight. The United States has a
greater weight in today's international system than the British Empire
had in European politics in the 19th century. The global elite is
heterogeneous, and there are profound differences in their cultural
archetypes and basic values]{.underline}. In the 19th century, the
differences between the members of the "concert" pertained to specific
issues in European politics, to the "manual tuning" of the complicated
European mechanism. In the 21st century, the differences between the
great powers pertain to the very foundations of the world order, the
basic principles of international law, and even more important questions
such as justice, legitimacy, and the "great meanings" of history. On the
other hand, [the Concert of Europe was so successful largely due to its
flexibility. Great European powers could afford the luxury of promptly
changing the configuration of unions, coalitions, and alliances to
maintain the overall balance of the system]{.underline}. For instance,
France was one of Russia's main adversaries in the Crimean War. Just a
year later, after the Treaty of Paris was signed in 1856, Russia and
France embarked upon a phase of active rapprochement, which resulted in
Russia's final break with Austria and Austria's defeat in its 1859
conflict with France. Could we imagine such flexibility today? Could we
suppose that over the course of two or three years, Russia would be
capable of swapping its current partnership with China for an alliance
with the United States? Or that the European Union, as it faces
increasing pressure from the United States, would re-orient itself
towards strategic cooperation with Moscow? Such scenarios look
improbable at best and absurd at worst. [Alas, the leaders of great
powers today do not have the flexibility that is absolutely necessary to
maintain a stable multipolar world order]{.underline}. At the end of our
short historical sketch, we can ask another curious question. Why did
the 1814--1815 Congress of Vienna result in a stable European order,
while the 1919 Treaty of Versailles became meaningless 15 years after it
was signed? How is it possible that the members of the anti-France
coalition were capable of magnanimity towards their former enemy, while
members of the anti-German coalition were not? Was it because George
Clemenceau, David Lloyd George, and Woodrow Wilson were more stupid or
bloodthirsty than Alexander I, Klemens von Metternich, and Charles
Maurice de Talleyrand? Of course not. [It is just that the Concert of
Europe was created by autocratic monarchs, while the Treaty of
Versailles was designed by leaders of western democracies. The latter
were far more dependent on national public sentiment than their
predecessors were a century earlier]{.underline}. And the public
sentiments of nations that had experienced four years of suffering,
unprecedented privations, and losses demanded that the Germans be
punished in the harshest and most uncompromising manner. And this is
what the victors ultimately did, thus planting the seeds of the global
carnage that was to come. Clearly, over the last hundred years,
politicians have grown even more dependent on the smallest fluctuations
in public opinion. Unfortunately, the chances of seeing new examples of
Alexander's magnanimity and Metternich's insight today are slim. To
paraphrase Pushkin, we can say that "political populism and
multipolarity are two things incompatible." The "Gangsters" and "Molls"
of the Multipolar World A famous cliché in international relations
(attributed to a variety of authors, from Otto von Bismarck to Stanley
Kubrick) states that on the global stage, large states act as gangsters
and small states act as molls. [The concept of a multipolar world is
geared towards the "gangsters" and ignores the "molls." Not every state
and not even every coalition of states has the right to claim the status
of a "pole" in the international system]{.underline}. The adherents of
multipolarity believe that most contemporary states are simply incapable
of independently ensuring their own security and economic growth, not to
mention making a significant contribution to shaping the new world
order\[4\]. Thus, in both the current and future multipolar world, only
a handful of countries have "true sovereignty," while others sacrifice
this sovereignty in the name of security, prosperity, or even plain
survival.\[5\] At the time of the Concert of Europe, the "gangsters"
could successfully control the "molls" who depended on them, and the
number of "molls" was relatively small. Two centuries later, the
situation has changed drastically. [Today, there are about 200 states
that are members of the UN, and then there are unrecognized states and
non-state actors. Therefore, the majority of members of international
relations in the new multipolar world has been assigned the unenviable
role of extras or observers]{.underline}. [Even if we ignore the moral
and ethical deficiency of such a world order, there are grave doubts
that such a project is feasible, especially given mounting problems in
current military, political, and economic unions and the sharp rise of
nationalism that affects both great powers and small and medium-sized
countries]{.underline}. [The adherents of multipolarity probably think
that the "poles" of the new world order will form naturally, that the
"molls" will rush into the arms of neighbouring "gangsters" out of love
rather than by coercion. That is, they will be driven by geographic
proximity, economic expediency, common history, cultural similarities,
etc. Unfortunately, historical experience would suggest the
contrary]{.underline}. French-speaking Flanders has for centuries fended
off the obtrusive patronage of Paris; Portugal has for an equally long
time striven to distance itself from the geographically and culturally
close Spain; and for some reason, Vietnam has failed to appreciate the
advantages of belonging to China's "pole." It would be best to not even
recall the state of relations between Russia and once "brotherly"
Ukraine. [If the "molls" are forced to turn to the "gangsters" for
protection, they clearly prefer "gangsters" from a remote neighbourhood
rather than from their own street]{.underline}. Generally speaking, such
preferences are sometimes somewhat logical. [And if this is the case,
then "poles" can only be formed "voluntarily under duress," as the
Russian saying goes -- and in the 21st century, such foundations have
dubious stability]{.underline}. One gets the impression that the Russian
discourse about the impending multipolar world confuses the notions of
legal equality ("equal rights") and actual equality (identity as the
ultimate equality). [States cannot actually be equal to each other:
their size, resources, and capabilities, as well as their economic,
military, and political potential, differ too greatly]{.underline}. Yet
the apparent inequality of states does not necessarily mean that they
should also have different basic rights. There is the principle of all
citizens being equal before the law regardless of the differences in
social status, property, education, and talents.

Trump's National Security Strategy Boldly Reasserts American Leadership
<https://www.heritage.org/homeland-security/commentary/trumps-national-security-strategy-boldly-reasserts-american-leadership>)
\[Twinz\]

In the Obama White House, [the mantra of "leading from behind" was so
deeply embedded that America's allies were often left confused and
disoriented when it came to U.S. foreign policy]{.underline}. President
Barack [Obama's 2015 National Security Strategy was a curious mishmash
of lofty idealism and outreach to dictatorial regimes such as Iran and
Cuba, combined with a refusal to even acknowledge that an ideological
war existed against Islamists]{.underline}. Obama's National Security
Strategy listed climate change as a "top strategic risk to our
interests" alongside use of weapons of mass destruction, while the
threat posed by ISIS and al-Qaeda was simply dubbed "violent extremism."
Just as Obama himself began his two term presidency with an apology tour
across the world, his strategy warned that America's own values had been
under threat in the post 9/11 era in the war on terror. [The new
National Security Strategy]{.underline} released early Monday
[by]{.underline} President Donald [Trump's White House sets a very
different, distinctly unapologetic tone]{.underline}. [It takes a
clear-cut view of the immense challenges faced by the United States from
an array of actors, from Russia, China, and North Korea to
transnational, largely Islamist terror networks. In addition, the
strategy emphatically rules out the idea of extending the hand of
friendship to rogue regimes such as Iran]{.underline}. [The projection
of American leadership is front and center in the new
strategy]{.underline}. [The document contains a strong rejection of the
idea that the United States should share global leadership with Moscow
and Beijng in a supposedly multipolar world]{.underline}: [The United
States will respond to the growing political, economic, and military
competitions we face around the world. China and Russia challenge
American power, influence, and interests, attempting to erode American
security and prosperity. They are determined to make economies less free
and less fair, to grow their militaries, and to control information and
data to repress their societies and expand their influence. These
competitions require the United States to rethink the policies of the
past two decades---]{.underline}policies based on the assumption that
engagement with rivals and their inclusion in international institutions
and global commerce would turn them into benign actors and trustworthy
partners. For the most part, this premise turned outlateral to be false.
[Trump's National Security Strategy]{.underline}, which runs to 70 pages
(in contrast to 2015's 29 pages), [outlines four pillars for advancing
and defending America's interests on the world stage: protecting the
American people, the homeland, and the American way of life; promoting
American prosperity; preserving peace through strength; and advancing
American influence]{.underline}. At the core of the new strategy is an
emphasis on controlling America's borders, rebuilding America's
military, and competing and leading in international organizations,
including NATO and the United Nations, while pressing to make them more
accountable and effective. [As the new strategy makes clear, America's
enemies should be under no illusions regarding U.S.
resolve]{.underline}: We must convince adversaries that we can and will
defeat them---not just punish them if they attack the United States. We
must ensure the ability to deter potential enemies by
denial---convincing them that they cannot accomplish objectives through
the use of force or other forms of aggression. We need our allies to do
the same. [The document is a bold reassertion of American leadership and
a refusal to bow to the siren calls of isolationism]{.underline}. [It is
a robust defense of the principles of national sovereignty and
self-determination, as well as a recognition that the United States can
best lead on the world stage by upholding its own sovereignty and that
of its allies]{.underline}. The document also includes powerful support
for religious freedom, an important message to send both at home and
abroad, as well as a welcome call to rethink foreign aid, by basing
foreign assistance on free market principles and private investment.
[The 2017 National Security Strategy should reassure America's friends
and allies that the United States is firmly committed to leading the
free world. At the same time, it should serve as a stark warning to
America's adversaries and strategic competitors that the U.S. will renew
its military might, reject failed strategies of engagement, and use its
resources to challenge and where necessary defeat those who threaten the
security of the American people]{.underline}.

### Revisionism

#### Extinction

**Kagan 17** (Robert, Fellow at the Brookings Institution, "Backing Into
World War III", Foreign Policy, 2/6,

[[**Granting the revisionist powers spheres of influence is not a recipe
for peace and tranquility but rather an invitation to inevitable
conflict**. Russia's historical sphere of influence does not end in
Ukraine. It begins in Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}. It extends to the
Baltic States, to the Balkans, and to the heart of Central Europe. And
within Russia's traditional sphere of influence, other nations do not
enjoy autonomy or even sovereignty. There was no independent Poland
under the Russian Empire nor under the Soviet Union. [[For China to gain
its desired sphere of influence in East Asia will mean that, when it
chooses, it can close the region off to the United
States]{.underline}]{.mark} --- not only militarily but politically and
economically, too.¶ China will, of course, inevitably exercise great
sway in its own region, as will Russia. The United States cannot and
should not prevent China from being an economic powerhouse. Nor should
it wish for the collapse of Russia. The United States should even
welcome competition of a certain kind. [Great powers compete across
multiple planes]{.underline} --- economic, ideological, and political,
as well as military. **[Competition in most spheres is necessary and
even healthy]{.underline}**. Within the liberal order, China can compete
economically and successfully with the United States; Russia can thrive
in the international economic order upheld by the democratic system,
even if it is not itself democratic.¶ But military and strategic
competition is different. The security situation undergirds everything
else. It remains true today as it has since World War II that only the
United States has the capacity and the unique geographical advantages to
provide global security and relative stability. [[There is no stable
balance of power in Europe or Asia without the United
States]{.underline}. And while we can talk about "[soft power" and
"smart power,"]{.underline} they [have been and always will be of
limited value when confronting raw military power]{.underline}.]{.mark}
[Despite all of the loose talk of American decline, it is in the
military realm where U.S. advantages remain clearest.]{.mark} Even in
other great powers' backyards, **[the United States retains the
capacity, along with its powerful allies, to deter challenges to the
security order]{.underline}**. But **[[without a U.S. willingness to
maintain the balance in far-flung regions of the world, the system will
buckle under the unrestrained military competition of regional
powers.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Part of that willingness entails defense
spending commensurate with America's continuing global role.¶ [For the
United States to accept a return to spheres of influence
would]{.underline} not calm the international waters. It would merely
[return the world to the condition it was in at the end of the 19th
century, with competing great powers clashing over inevitably
intersecting and overlapping spheres]{.underline}. These **[unsettled,
disordered conditions produced the fertile ground for the two
destructive world wars]{.underline}** of the first half of the 20th
century. The collapse of the British-dominated world order on the
oceans, the disruption of the uneasy balance of power on the European
continent as a powerful unified Germany took shape, and the rise of
Japanese power in East Asia all contributed to a highly competitive
international environment in which [[dissatisfied great powers took the
opportunity to pursue their ambitions in the absence of any power or
group of powers to unite in checking them]{.mark}. [The result was an
unprecedented global calamity and death on an epic
scale]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It has [been the great accomplishment of
the U.S.-led world order in the 70 years since the end of World War II
that this kind of competition has been held in check and great power
conflicts have been avoided]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [It will be
more than a shame if Americans were to destroy what they created --- and
not because it was no longer possible to sustain but simply because they
chose to stop trying.]{.mark}

### FMS

#### FMS are a vital military tool and they cement US heg 

**Goure 16** (Daniel Gouré, Ph.D., 2-26-2016, \"Foreign Military Sales
Remain An Important Tool Of U.S. National Security,\" Lexington
Institute,
<https://www.lexingtoninstitute.org/foreign-military-sales-remain-an-important-tool-of-u-s-national-security/>)
RK

As still the world's sole superpower, [the United States possesses an
unequaled array of instruments to support its foreign and defense
strategies. With]{.underline} so much [attention being focused on the
conflicts in the Middle East, Russian aggression in Eastern Europe and
Chinese efforts to assert its hegemony in the Western
Pacific]{.underline}, [the fact that the United States employs a wide
range of non-military, or at least **non-kinetic tools** in pursuing its
national interests is lost]{.underline}. Most recently, for example, the
United States and China agreed on the imposition of new trade sanctions
on North Korea in response to that country's test of a long-range
ballistic missile. **[One of the most important of these tools is
foreign military sales]{.underline}** (FMS). [The complex role of FMS is
reflected]{.underline}, in part, [in the fact that the program is run by
the Department of State and not the Department of Defense]{.underline}.
[One reason for this unusual management approach is that the FMS program
involves sales by the U.S. government of U.S. arms, defense equipment,
defense services, and military training to foreign
governments]{.underline}. As a result, such sales reflect the views of
the U.S. government with respect to the recipient country, its
relationships with others in the region and the overall approach this
country takes to mitigating the threat of regional or global conflict.
[The FMS program serves many other purposes]{.underline}. [The sales of
U.S. arms and related items to foreign countries helps reduce the cost
of those systems to our own military]{.underline}. [FMS sales help to
ensure the ability of U.S. allies to defend themselves and support the
maintenance of **stable regional military balances**]{.underline}.
Equally important, [FMS sales over time establish enduring relationships
between foreign governments and their militaries and the
U.S]{.underline}. When the U.S. military trains alongside those of
allies equipped with the same hardware**[, it helps to cement the bonds
between our countries]{.underline}**. Moreover, [it improves
communications]{.underline} and understanding among these militaries,
often [helping to inculcate U.S. values related to the use of military
force]{.underline}. Foreign militaries dependent on access to U.S.
hardware, spare parts, software upgrades and training are more likely to
listen to this country when there is a dispute regarding regional
politics or defense issues. [FMS has been particularly important as an
instrument for influencing foreign governments and **shaping regional
balances of power in the Middle East**.]{.underline} Following the 1973
Arab-Israeli War, the United States completely reequipped the Egyptian
military. The Egyptian-Israeli border has been remarkably stable ever
since. Sales of military aircraft, missile defense systems and precision
munitions to the nations of the Persian Gulf have been instrumental in
ensuring a stable balance of forces in that area. [Pakistan has been a
recipient of U.S. arms. FMS sales have been extremely important to U.S.
efforts to ensure Pakistan's reliability as an ally in the war on
terror]{.underline}. Congress has appropriated about \$3.6 billion in
Foreign Military Financing (FMF) for Pakistan since 2001. The kind of
equipment provided ranges from radios, transport aircraft and unmanned
systems to F-16 fighters. Recently, [the State Department approved the
sale of eight F-16s to Pakistan.]{.underline} [Pakistan intends to use
these aircraft in its fight against domestic terrorists.]{.underline}
The U.S. and other regional allies have found the F-16 to be an
effective platform for conducting precision strikes against terrorist
targets. In addition, India is pursuing a major Air Force modernization
program. The sale of F-16s to Pakistan would help to maintain the
balance of power in the subcontinent.

### NATO

#### Arms sales to NATO are key to sustain military spending 

**Cloughley 18** (Brian Cloughley, 7-31-18, \"NATO is a Goldmine for US
Weapons' Industries,\" MintPress News,
<https://www.mintpressnews.com/nato-us-weapons-industries/246736/>) RK

[Countries of the NATO military alliance have been ordered by President
Trump to increase their spending on weapons]{.underline}, and the
reasons for his insistence they do so are becoming clearer. [It's got
nothing to do with any defence rationale, because, after all, the
Secretary General of the US-NATO military alliance,]{.underline} Jens
Stoltenberg, has admitted that "[we don't see any imminent threat
against any NATO ally"]{.underline} and the Stockholm International
Peace Research Institute recorded in its 2018 World Report that "at
\$66.3 billion, Russia's military spending in 2017 was 20 per cent lower
than in 2016." Even Radio Free Europe, the US government's anti-Russia
broadcaster, records that [Russia has reduced its defence spending.
There is demonstrably no threat whatever to any NATO country by
Russi]{.underline}a, but this is considered irrelevant in the context of
US arms' sales, which are flourishing and being encouraged to increase
and multiply. On July 12, the second and final day of the recent US-NATO
meeting, Reuters reported Trump as saying that "the United States makes
by far the best military equipment in the world: the best jets, the best
missiles, the best guns, the best everything." He went on "to list the
top US arms makers, Lockheed Martin Corp, Boeing Co and Northrop Grumman
Corp by name." On July 11 the Nasdaq Stock Exchange listed the stock
price of Lockheed Martin at \$305.68. The day after Trump's speech, it
increased to \$318.37. On July 11 the Nasdaq Stock Exchange listed the
stock price of Boeing at \$340.50. The day after Trump's speech, it
increased to \$350.79. On July 11 the New York Stock Exchange listed the
stock price of Northrop Grumman (it doesn't appear on Nasdaq) at
\$311.71. The day after Trump's speech, it increased to \$321.73.
General Dynamics, another major US weapons producer, might not be too
pleased, however, because its stock price rose only slightly, from
\$191.51 to \$192.74. Nor might Raytheon, the maker of the Patriot
missile system which Washington is selling all over the world, because
its stock went up by a modest five dollars, from \$194.03 to \$199.75.
[Perhaps they will be named by Trump the next time he makes a speech
telling his country's bemused allies to buy US weapons]{.underline}.
Trump also declared that "We have many wealthy countries with us today
\[July 12 at the NATO Conference\] but we have some that aren't so
wealthy and they did ask me if they could buy the military equipment,
and could I help them out, and we will help them out a little bit,"
which made it clear that poorer countries that want to buy American
weapons will probably not have to put cash down for their purchases. So
it wasn't altogether surprising that the stock prices of the three arms
manufacturers named by Trump all rose by over ten dollars. To further
boost this bonanza, [the State Department did its best to make US arms
sales even easier by enabling weapons manufacturers to avoid the
well-constructed checks and balances that had been in place to ensure
that at least a few legal, moral and economic constraints would be
observed when various disreputable regimes queued up to buy American
weapons]{.underline}. But these regulations no longer apply, because on
July 13 the State Department announced new measures to "fast-track
government approval of proposals from defense and aerospace companies"
which action was warmly welcomed by the President of the US Chamber of
Commerce Defence and Aerospace Export Council, Keith Webster, who is
"looking forward to continued collaboration with the White House on
initiatives that further expand international opportunities for the
defense and aerospace industries." There was yet more boosting by
Lt-General Charles Hooper, Director of the Defense Security Cooperation
Agency, who declared at the Farnborough International Air Show on July
18 that "[Defense exports are good for our national security, they're
good for our foreign policy. And they're good for our economic
security]{.underline}." [He then proposed that his agency cut the
transportation fee charged to foreign military sales
clients]{.underline}, [which would be a major stimulant for sales of
"the best jets, the best missiles, the best guns" so valued by Mr
Trump.]{.underline} Obviously a devoted follower of his President, the
General followed the Trump line with dedication by reminding the media
that "as the administration and our leadership has said, economic
security is national security." This man just might go places in Trump
World. But he won't go as far as the arms manufacturers, whose future
growth and profits are assured under Trump and the Washington Deep
State, which is defined as "military, intelligence and government
officials who try to secretly manipulate government policy." [US weapons
producers have realised, as said so presciently two thousand years ago
by the Roman statesman, Cicero, that "the sinews of war are infinite
money," and their contentment will continue to grow in synchrony with
their financial dividends.]{.underline} Voice of America joined the
chorus of reportage on July 12 and observed that "with Thursday's
renewed pledge by NATO countries to meet defense spending goals, some of
the biggest beneficiaries could be US weapons manufacturers, which
annually already export billions of dollars worth of arms across the
globe." Within European NATO, the biggest spenders on US arms, thus far,
are Poland, Romania, Britain and Greece, and the amounts involved are
colossal. Poland, whose economy is booming, has signed an agreement to
buy Patriot missile systems for \$4.75 billion, adding to the purchase
of Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles for \$200 million, Advanced
Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles, costing \$250 million, and High
Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems for the same amount. Delivery of its
48 F-16 multi-role strike aircraft (\$4.7 billion) began in 2006, and
Warsaw has proved a loyal customer ever since. Who knows what exotic new
piece of US hardware will be ordered as a result of Mr Trump's
encouragement? Romania, a country with only 750 kilometres of motorway
(tiny Belgium has 1,700 km), has been seeking World Bank assistance for
its road projects but is unlikely to benefit because it is so gravely
corrupt. This has not stopped it purchasing US artillery rocket systems
for \$1.25 billion and Patriot missiles for a colossal \$3.9 billion,
following-on from construction in May 2016 of a US Aegis missile
station, at Washington's expense. It forms part of the US-NATO
encirclement of Russia, and its missiles are to be operational this
year. [The message for European NATO is that the US is pulling out all
stops to sell weapons, and that although, for example, "about 84% of the
UK's total arms imports come from the United States", there is room for
improvement]{.underline}. Slovakia is buying \$150 millions' worth of
helicopters and paying a satisfying \$2.91 billion for F-16 fighters,
but other NATO countries appear to have been less disposed to purchase
more of "the best jets, the best missiles, the best guns" that Mr Trump
has on offer[. The mine of NATO gold is there for exploitation, and
following Trump's enthusiastic encouragement of his arms' manufacturers
it seems that extraction will be effective. The US Military-Industrial
Complex stands to gain handsomely from its President's campaign to boost
the quantities of weapons in the world.]{.underline}

### Saudi

#### US needs Saudi---they're our most important partner in the middle east 

**Cordesman 18** (Anthony Cordesman- Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy
\@CSIS., 3-22-2018, \"Saudi Arabia is a Critical American Security
Partner in the Middle East,\" No Publication,
<https://www.csis.org/analysis/saudi-arabia-critical-american-security-partner-middle-east>)
RK

Somewhere along the line[, we seem to have forgotten that our strategy
in the Middle East is dependent on Saudi Arabia as our most important
single security partner]{.underline}. Israel's security is certainly a
key American concern, but it does not play an active role in most of
America's ongoing military engagements in the region, in dealing with
Iran, or in a direct fight against violent extremist movements like ISIS
and Al Qaeda. [Saudi Arabia's role as a strategic partner has also been
enhanced by the fact that Egypt and Algeria are focused on their own
internal stability]{.underline}, [and their roles in the region have
sharply diminished, and Iraq and Syria both must deal with major
instability problems and are at war]{.underline}. Our European allies
have declining power projection capabilities, and Turkey's role in the
region is increasingly problematic. [It is certainly true that Saudi
Arabia needs the United States as much or more than the United States
needs Saudi Arabia.]{.underline} Saudi military forces are steadily
improving, [but it is the U.S. presence in the region that creates a
balance of forces that firmly deters Iran and has helped Saudi Arabia
defeat its own terrorist threats from groups like Al Qaeda in the
Arabian Peninsula**. U.S. arms shipments, advisory efforts and exercises
also play a critical role in improving Saudi forces.**]{.underline} But
**[the United States needs Saudi Arabia as well]{.underline}**. [Saudi
Arabia is now the most critical single security partner in ensuring the
stable flow of petroleum out of the Gulf regio]{.underline}n. While the
United States is largely eliminating its need for direct petroleum
imports, it is steadily increasing its dependence on the health and
growth of the global economy and imports from Asian states like China,
Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, which are critically dependent on Gulf
petroleum exports. [The end result is that U.S. strategic interests in
the region continue to increase in spite of the steady cut in U.S.
direct oil imports.]{.underline}

### arms sales- generic

#### Trump era hegemony is shaped by military support for regional allies---arms sales are a lynchpin of operations with NATO, Saudi Arabia, and Japan

International Policy Digest,
<https://intpolicydigest.org/2018/12/31/analysis-of-the-u-s-grand-strategy/>)
RK

In terms of security strategy, [the Trump administration has clearly
drawn away from the American grand strategic tradition of retrenchment
or deep engagement]{.underline}. 'America First' seems to have to
address US foreign policy by withdrawing from certain treaties and
intervening in the pursuit of US security and prosperity. [The US
current administration aims to maintain its security and prosperity by
allowing other great powers to promote a global liberal
order]{.underline}. The Trump administration uses foreign policy more
ambitiously because it considers an unprecedented grand [strategy of
illiberal hegemony]{.underline}. Traditional US liberal hegemony
strategy used to focus on promoting democracy and human rights, creating
multilateral institutions, and mirroring the international system
vis-à-vis the US values. In contrast, [Trump's illiberal hegemony
strategy seeks superior economic and military capability by portraying
the US as the world's arbiter]{.underline}. [Such]{.underline}
[a]{.underline}n expensive [strategy has increased the US defense
budget, security and military commitments, and nuclear modernization
programs]{.underline}. Contrary to previous administrations that
invested considerable sums of money in building democracy abroad, [the
Trump administration envisions engagement with the world's security
problems by targeting its main allies]{.underline} -- [Europe, Japan,
and Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. Trump's foreign policy in Europe
intensified EU efforts to reduce an over-reliance on US protection. It
seems that [the US administration is trying to return NATO to Europe by
mitigating its financial contribution and military spending for a NATO
expansion]{.underline}. As a result, the [EU launched a military
joint-force, PESCO]{.underline}, that could pave the way for an EU army.
PESCO was first established in the 2009 Lisbon Treaty, as an EU defense
cooperation. [PESCO members have pledged to increase defense budgets in
real terms regularly, genuinely pursue national investments with due
consideration for joint capability needs, expose national plans to EU
scrutiny, and, ultimately, provide more strategically deployable forces
than currently available today.]{.underline} [This]{.underline} force
[could play a leading role in scenarios such as peace support operations
in the Western Balkans]{.underline}. Although [the US has shown a
hesitation to embrace the idea of deeper European defense integration
fully]{.underline}, the US should support a more self-reliant EU. When
it comes to defense, [the goal is also to improve competitiveness and
enhance innovation across the continent's defense industr]{.underline}y.
In a post-Brexit world, the momentum behind PESCO offers an opportunity
for the US to revisit the EU's legacy goal of deploying and sustaining
60,000 ground troops as part of a joint force. In Asia, [Japan is the
most relevant US partner in some foreign policy areas, particularly in
security concerns, which range from hedging against Chinese military
modernization to countering threats from North Korea]{.underline}. In
2018, [Japan's military sees record spending]{.underline}, [aiming at
buying more US arms]{.underline}. Japan's Ministry of Defense in August
sought [record spending of 5.3 trillion-yen next year to help pay for
significant upgrades to defenses]{.underline} designed to shoot down any
North Korean ballistic missile. Japan military budget has grown for the
seventh year in a row. The US should allow Japan to pursue its own
military capability, which would lead to a political, military and
economic balance or rivalry within the region. [As for the Middle East,
US-Saudi alliance is extremely important for the US foreign policy due
to the US national interests of economic prosperity]{.underline},
[security]{.underline}, [the fight against terrorism and energy
supply]{.underline}. Trump's first foreign visit as US president was to
Saudi Arabia in May 2017, where a military deal worth \$110 billion
between the two countries was penned. [The Trump administration has
sought to strengthen ties to Saudi Arabia by signing this arms sales
contract]{.underline}. Additionally, [President Trump dismissed
proposals to cut arms sales to the kingdom and backed the Saudi Crown
Prince]{.underline}, Mohammed bin Salman's assertions that he did not
order the killing, despite the reported conclusions of the CIA.
Furthermore, [Saudi Arabia is the top destination for US arms, with US
defense sales to the kingdom totaling close to \$90 billion for the past
seventy years]{.underline}. In addition, both [countries share security
concerns about Iran]{.underline}. [They both have ramped up efforts to
counter Iran, Saudi Arabia's main regional rival.]{.underline} Regarding
energy supply, the US imports only 25% of Saudi oil reserves, whereas US
allies -- Europe and Japan -- depend on the Middle Eastern oil, and
therefore, should share the responsibility for stabilizing the region.
[By sharing with its allies the world's security problems, the US
strengthens the allies' presence, shares information, and develops deep
cooperation.]{.underline} Thus, [the US and its allies need to work
together and better balance the burden of democratic world order.
Alliances are better for everyone and institutions facilitate iterated
interactions amongst members.]{.underline} The US and European countries
cofounded most of the world's institutions in the aftermath of WWII.
Such institutions helped shape the world we live in. Therefore, the US
should maintain its robust presence in these institutions as well as in
multilateral agreements. As for counterterrorism and counterinsurgency,
[the US and its allies should increase their interaction regarding
strategic intelligence based on allied security forces. Terrorism is the
world's problem that needs a collective effort to fight against it.
Short-term military actions informed by long-term analysis, would
reshape the international environment and constrain terrorist attacks.
The Trump administration]{.underline} [should]{.underline} develop a
range of politically credible, clearly articulated indirect actions to
[support the allies' efforts to improve their civil defense
capabilities]{.underline}. By adopting a multipolar strategy, [the US
would allow other nations to build their military capabilities and
provide for their own national and regional security]{.underline}. In
this great geopolitical rebalancing, states share the burden of
maintaining stability in various parts of the world, looking for
absolute gains and more peaceful relations.

#### Arms sales are critical to military strategy and sustain alliances 

**Thomas 17** (Clayton Thomas- Analyst in Middle Eastern Affairs for the
CRS, 10-11-17 "Arms Sales in the Middle East: Trends and Analytical
Perspectives for U.S. Policy,"
<https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/R44984.pdf> )RK\
While scholars debate the relative effects of arms transfers between
nations and the relationship between arms transfers and interstate
behavior, 3 [arms sales are recognized widely as an important instrument
of state power.]{.underline} [States have many incentives to export
arms.]{.underline} These [incentives include enhancing the security of
allies or partners; constraining the behavior of adversaries; using the
prospect of arms transfers as leverage on governments' internal or
external behavior; and creating the economies of scale necessary to
support a domestic arms industry]{.underline} (see textbox below). 4
U**[.S. arms exports sustain parts of the U.S. defense industrial
base]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[foreign sales constitute a relatively
important part of the U.S. economy]{.underline}**, constituting 6.2% of
the value of all U.S. exports from 2007 and 2014, compared with a
worldwide average of 0.8% over the same period and 1.9% for Russia (one
of the United States' main competitors in this arena). 5 Direct
deployment of U.S. manpower and resources appears to feature less
prominently in current U.S. public opinion and policy debates regarding
future foreign policy approaches to the Middle East than was the case in
the years following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
Therefore, **[arms sales in the region may become a significant way for
the United States and other external actors to influence Middle Eastern
partners and political-military outcomes.]{.underline}**6 On the other
hand, U.S. reliance on arms sales as a policy tool places at least some
responsibility for their use in the hands of partners who do not always
share U.S. interests, follow internationally-acceptable rules of
engagement, or have the same capabilities as U.S. forces. [Congress,
through its oversight of U.S. arms sales, plays an important role in
shaping U.S. policy in the region.]{.underline} In past eras when arms
sales figured prominently in U.S. regional or global efforts,
congressional actions and opinions in specific cases arguably had a
significant effect on overall policy trajectories. Arms Sales and
Domestic Industry Arms sales are an important contributor to the U.S.
aerospace and defense industry, a sector that directly employs over 1
million workers, with another 3 million working in support.7 According
to one industry observer, [international sales have made up 20 percent
of U.S. firms' total sales in recent years]{.underline}, and industry
executives reportedly expect that figure to grow.8 [Middle Eastern
states play a critical role in sustaining this industry]{.underline}. In
early 2014, it was reported that, as the U.S. Navy looked to shift from
the F-18 to the new Lockheed Martinproduced F-35, Boeing's F-18 assembly
line in St. Louis, MO, could close within two and a half years. Similar
projections were made for the F-15 production line, which would come to
an end in 2019 after fulfilling a large order from Saudi Arabia.
However, two large deals with other Middle Eastern partners (Kuwait and
Qatar9) appeared to save those lines from closure and extend their
operations into at least 2020. Similar dynamics have played out in South
Carolina (where a potential deal with Bahrain for a number of F-16s
could boost a Lockheed-Martin plant in the state),10 Ohio (where Saudi
orders have sustained General Dynamics tank production in Lima),11
Massachusetts (home to Raytheon, whose production of the Patriot air and
missile defense system was rejuvenated by a 2008 UAE deal),12 and
elsewhere. House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chairwoman Kay
Granger, [in response to a Trump Administration decision to delay some
military aid to Egypt, said that when sales are curtailed, "the
companies and the workers that put that equipment together in the United
States are hurt]{.underline}."13 Opponents of specific arms sales
sometimes characterize these potential economic benefits as short-term
or incommensurate with the potential downsides. During a June 2017
debate over sales of air munitions to Saudi Arabia, Senator Rand Paul
criticized those who would justify the deal as "a jobs program," saying
that "we are going to give money to people who behead you and crucify
you to create jobs. That should never be the way we make a decision
about arms sales in our country."14 [The Middle East is one of the most
militarized regions in the world, featuring numerous conflicts or
standoffs that involve nearly every state in the region.]{.underline}
Israeli leaders, pointing to a series of perceived existential threats
including several major wars between Israel and its neighbors, assert a
continued need to maintain a large and technologically advanced
military. [Iran is seen as a threat not just by the United States and
Israel, but by nearly every one of its neighbors in the Persian
Gulf]{.underline}. Ongoing conflicts in places like Yemen, Syria, and
Libya demonstrate the extent to which other states seek to influence
outcomes through the use of their own military forces and through arms
transfers to local partners. Several [additional factors have created an
enormous demand for arms in the region. Many countries face
transnational terrorist threats and, in some cases, domestic
insurgencies]{.underline}. In addition, [many states have large
militaries that often play a prominent, even dominant, role in domestic
and international politics]{.underline}. Advances in technology and
capabilities have made some systems obsolete, creating a need for new
acquisitions. Some have argued that the importance Middle Eastern
governments evidently ascribe to large weapons purchases stems from the
role of arms in building international credibility, as well as national
pride and identity. These are [strong incentives in a region where
legitimacy is widely contested and where some states became independent
less than half a century ago]{.underline}.15 By almost every measure,
the Middle East is a main participating region in the global arms trade,
constituting 61.1% of the value of all arms agreements concluded by all
suppliers with the developing world from 2012 to 2015, and 54.5% from
2008 to 2011. [The Middle East has particular importance for the United
States: arms from the United States made up 46.2% of all arms delivered
to the Middle East]{.underline} from 2008 to 2011, and 45.8% between
2012 and 2015, outpacing those from the next largest supplier (Russia,
whose deliveries totaled 19.1% and 17.5% of all deliveries to the Middle
East, respectively).16 Those trends show no sign of slowing down in an
increasingly militarized region

### Arms sales bad

#### Arms sales destabilize regions---the us doesn't discriminate between high and low risk countries

Washington's [faith in the wisdom of foreign arms sales is seriously
misplaced]{.underline}. The [benefits]{.underline} tend to be
[oversold]{.underline}, and the [downsides]{.underline} are often simply
[ignored]{.underline}. The [defense industry and its
champions]{.underline}, in particular, [have]{.underline} long
[exaggerated the economic boon of arms
sales]{.underline}.[5](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor005)
And even if they were greater, economic benefits alone are not worth
subverting strategic considerations. More importantly, the [strategic
deficits of arms sales are severe]{.underline} enough to overwhelm even
the most optimistic economic argument. It is the strategic case for and
against arms sales that we consider in this analysis. [Arms sales create
a host of negative, unintended consequences that warrant a much more
**cautious and limited approach**]{.underline}, even in support of an
expansive grand strategy like primacy or liberal hegemony. From the
perspective of those who would prefer a more restrained American foreign
policy, [the prospective benefits of engaging in the arms trade are even
smaller.]{.underline} [Even in cases where the United States wants a
nation to arm itself, there is rarely a need for the weapons to come
from the United States.]{.underline} Moreover, [the United States would
generate significant **diplomatic flexibility and moral authority** by
refraining from selling arms]{.underline}. Given these outsized risks
and nebulous rewards, [the United States should greatly reduce
international arms sales.]{.underline} To develop our argument we begin
in section one with a quantitative analysis of U.S. arms sales since
9/11 in order to illustrate the dangerous track record of recent sales.
We then provide a brief history of U.S. arms sales policy to provide a
context for the current process in section two. Section three outlines
the advocates' case for arms sales and section four outlines the case
against. We conclude with a brief discussion of the current politics of
the arms trade and a series of policy recommendations. U.S. Arms Sales
since 9/11: Assessing the Risk from Arms Sales In order to comply with
the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), the U.S. government must generate a
risk assessment in order to confirm that sales are unlikely to produce
unwanted outcomes. This requirement makes sense, because history shows
that arms sales can lead to a host of negative, unintended consequences.
These [consequences come in many forms]{.underline}, [from]{.underline}
[those that affect the United States, such as blowback and entanglement
in foreign conflicts]{.underline}, [to those that affect entire regions,
such as instability and dispersion]{.underline}, [to those that affect
the recipient regime itself,]{.underline} such as enabling oppression
and [increasing the likelihood of military coups]{.underline}.
Forecasting how weapons will be used, especially over the course of
decades, is difficult, but history provides evidence of the factors that
make negative outcomes more likely. Sadly, however, [even a cursory
review of American arms sales over time makes it clear that neither the
White House, nor the Pentagon, nor the State Department]{.underline} ---
all of which are involved in approving potential sales --- [takes the
risk assessment process seriously]{.underline}. Historically, [the
United States has sold weapons to almost any nation that wanted to buy
them]{.underline} --- suggesting that [the risk assessment process is
rigged to not find risk.]{.underline} From 2002 to 2016, America
delivered \$197 billion in weapons to 167 states
worldwide.[6](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor006)
Thirty-two of these countries purchased at least \$1 billion in arms.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was America's biggest client, purchasing
\$25.8 billion worth of weapons --- including F-15s and a litany of
helicopters, naval assets, and associated munitions. As shown in Table
1, the top 10 clients collectively bought \$124 billion in arms ---
accounting for roughly two-thirds of the value of America's total global
exports since 2002. Given the amount of chaos, instability, and conflict
in the world, it is difficult to imagine what sort of process would
assess as many as 167 of
![https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/images/pubs/pa-836/pa-836-figure-1.png](media/image2.png){width="6.108146325459318in"
height="4.893600174978128in"}the world's roughly 200 countries as safe
bets to receive American weapons. Moreover, [the United States has a
long history of selling weapons to nations where the immediate risks
were obvious]{.underline}. From 1981 to 2010, the United States sold
small arms and light weapons to 59 percent and major conventional
weapons to 35 percent of countries actively engaged in a high-level
conflict. The United States sold small arms to 66 percent and major
conventional weapons to 40 percent of countries actively engaged in a
low-level
conflict.[7](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor007)
As one author noted, in 1994 there were 50 ongoing ethnic and
territorial conflicts in the world and the United States had armed at
least one side in 45 of them. Since 9/11, the United States has sold
weapons to at least two dyads in conflict: Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and
Turkey and the
Kurds.[8](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor008)
To produce a risk assessment of American arms recipients since 2002, we
consulted previous research to identify the risk factors most commonly
associated with both short- and long-term negative outcomes.
Unfortunately, there are no hard data on the precise relationship
between many of these risk factors and the probability of negative
outcomes. We also lack data entirely for certain risk factors that we
would otherwise have included. A nation's previous use (and misuse) of
American weapons, for example, is clearly among the most important
factors to assess. Neither the government nor academic research,
however, exists to inform such an assessment. As a result, we take a
conservative approach, creating an index of overall riskiness based on
straightforward assumptions about the correlations between risk factors
and negative outcomes on data that are available, rather than attempting
to make precise predictions about the impact of each specific risk
factor, or speculating about the impact of factors we cannot measure.
The first risk factor we consider is the stability of the recipient
nation. We assume that fragile [states with tenuous legitimacy and
little ability to deliver services and police their own territory, or
those that cannot manage conflict within their borders, pose a greater
risk for the dispersion and misuse of weapons]{.underline}. Research
also indicates that military aid can increase the likelihood of a
military coup, an outcome even more likely in the case of a fragile
state.[9](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor009)
To measure this factor, we take the most recent score for each nation on
the Fragile States Index, which determines a state's vulnerability by
looking at a range of economic, political, and social
factors.[10](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor010)
The second risk factor we look at is the behavior of the state toward
its own citizens. We assume that states that rank poorly on human rights
performance or that regularly use violence against their own people pose
a greater risk of misusing weapons in the short or long term. To measure
this we rely on two sources: Freedom House's Freedom in the
Worldrankings, which assess "the condition of political rights and civil
liberties around the
world,"[11](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor011)
and the State Department's Political Terror Scale, which provides a more
specific measurement of a state's use of torture and violence against
its
citizens.[12](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor012)
Finally, we consider the level of conflict, both internal and external,
each state is engaged in. We assume that countries dealing with
widespread terrorism and insurgency, or actively engaged in an
interstate conflict, also represent higher risks of negative outcomes
such as dispersion, blowback, entanglement, conflict, and human rights
abuses. Though the United States may have reasons to provide arms to
nations engaged in such conflicts or dealing with terrorism, the risk of
negative consequences remains. To assess these factors, we rely on the
Global Terrorism Index, which measures the scope of terrorism in a
country, and the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset, published by the
Uppsala Conflict Data Program and the Peace Research Institute Oslo,
which tracks each country's involvement in wars as well as in smaller
conflicts.[13](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor013)
To gauge the riskiness of selling weapons to a given country, we
combined its scores on these five metrics into a single risk index
score. Since the measures all used different scales, we first recoded
each of them into three categories: low, medium, and high risk. For
example, we coded "not free" countries as high risk (3 points); "partly
free" countries as medium risk (2 points); and "free" countries as low
risk (1 point). The result was a risk index that runs from 5 (countries
scoring "low risk" on all measures) to 15 (countries scoring "high risk"
on all measures). To facilitate our reporting we then grouped the
results into four risk categories. We gave the Highest Risk designation
to the 5 countries that scored as "high risk" on every measure. At the
other end of the spectrum, the Lowest Risk category contains the 38
countries that rated as "low risk" on all five measures. The categories
between these two are Very Risky (64 countries) and Somewhat Risky (60
countries).
![https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/images/pubs/pa-836/pa-836-figure-2.png](media/image1.png){width="6.9567104111986in"
height="3.496910542432196in"}Table 2 reveals the distribution of
countries across risk categories as well as the average total arms sales
by category since 2002. Three important observations immediately emerge
from the analysis. First, [there are a large number of risky customers
in the world, and the United States sells weapons to most of
them.]{.underline} Thirty-five nations (21 percent) scored in the
highest-risk category on at least two metrics, and 72 (43 percent) were
in the highest-risk category on at least one of the five measures. There
simply are not that many safe bets when it comes to the arms trade.
Second, the [data provide compelling evidence that the United States
does not discriminate between high- and low-risk customers]{.underline}.
The average sales to the riskiest nations are higher than those to the
least risky nations. Considering discrete components of the index, for
example, the 22 countries coded as "highest risk" on the Global
Terrorism Index bought an average of \$1.91 billion worth of American
weapons. The 28 countries in active, high-level conflicts bought an
average of \$2.94 billion worth of arms. Applying our risk assessment
framework to the list of 16 nations currently banned from buying
American weapons helps illustrate the validity of our approach. The
average score of banned nations is 11.6, with 12 nations scoring 10 or
higher. The highest-scoring nations were Syria, Sudan, and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, with Iran, Eritrea, and the Central
African Republic not far behind. Clearly these are nations to which the
United States should not be selling weapons. What is especially
troubling is that the United States sold weapons to several of these
countries in the years right before sales were banned, when most of the
risks were readily apparent. Moreover, America's customer list includes
32 countries with a risk score above the average of those on the banned
list. This reinforces our concern that the U.S. government does not
block sales to countries that clearly pose a risk of negative
consequences. The third major observation is that this [lack of
discrimination is dangerous]{.underline}. As simple as it is, our risk
assessment is a useful guide to forecasting negative consequences. The
five countries that scored as high risk on all five measures provide a
clear illustration of the risks of arms sales. This group, which
purchased an average of \$1.8 billion in U.S. weapons since 9/11,
includes Libya, Iraq, Yemen, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and
Sudan. These five countries, recall, are classified by the [various
metrics as: "terror everywhere," "not free," "most fragile," "large
impact from terrorism," and as being involved in high-level
conflicts]{.underline}. These governments have used their American
weapons to promote oppression, commit human rights abuses, and
perpetuate bloody civil wars. Within the Very Risky category, each
country rated as "highest risk" on at least one measure, and 30 scored
as "highest risk" on at least two measures. This group also represents
the full range of unintended consequences from arms sales. Afghanistan,
Egypt, Somalia, and Ukraine fall into this category. This group
collectively spent an average of \$1.38 billion over the time period.
Since 9/11, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (which scored a 12) invaded
Yemen, intervened in Tunisia and Syria, and provoked a crisis with
Qatar, while cementing a track record of human rights abuses and
government oppression. Other states in this category, such as
Afghanistan (score of 14), have entangled the United States in
counterproductive conflicts since 9/11 and continue to do so today.
[Even arms sales to the less risky nations do not come without
risk.]{.underline} For example, the Somewhat Risky category includes the
United Arab Emirates, which is involved in an active conflict in Yemen,
as well as Georgia, which has dangerous neighbors. Finally, the [Lowest
Risk category includes most of the NATO nations, Taiwan, South Korea,
and a range of other, mostly smaller nations with stable governments,
such as Barbados and Grenada, located in friendly
neighborhoods]{.underline}. [These countries pose little risk for
problems like dispersion, destabilization, or misuse of weapons for
oppression]{.underline}. In some cases, however, **[arms sales could
alter regional balances of power in ways that increase tensions and the
chance of conflic]{.underline}**t. [U.S. arms sales to NATO
allies]{.underline}, as part of the European Reassurance Initiative, for
example, [have upset Russian
leaders]{.underline}.[14](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor014)
Similarly, arms sales to Taiwan, itself not a risky customer, have
nonetheless raised tensions between China and the United
States.[15](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor015)
In short, even a relatively simple risk assessment makes it clear that
the policy of the United States is to sell weapons to just about any
nation that can afford them without much concern for the consequences.
Though the United States does limit its most advanced weapons to
allies[16](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor016)
and maintains a ban on the sale of materials related to weapons of mass
destruction,[17](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor017)
the United States has sold just about everything else, in many cases to
countries embroiled in interstate and civil conflicts, to countries with
horrendous human rights records, and to countries that represent a risk
for entangling the United States in unwanted conflicts.

### No link- alliances

#### Doesn't fix heg\-- alliances

**Thrall and Dorminey 18** (A Trevor Thrall- senior fellow for the
Cato's Institute's Defense and Foreign Policy Department, with expertise
in international security and the politics of American national security

RK

At the strategic level, [the United States inhabits such an extremely
favorable security environment in the post-Cold War world that **most
arms sales do little or nothing to improve** its
**security**]{.underline}. Thanks to its geography, friendly (and weak)
neighbors, large and dynamic economy, and secure nuclear arsenal, [the
United States faces very few significant threats]{.underline}. There is
no Soviet Union bent upon dominating Europe and destroying the United
States. China, despite its rapid rise, cannot (and has no reason to)
challenge the sovereignty or territorial integrity of the United States.
Arms sales --- to allies or others --- are unnecessary to deter major,
direct threats to U.S. national security in the current
era.[47](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor047)
[Nor are arms sales necessary to protect the United States from "falling
dominoes," or the consequences of conflicts elsewhere]{.underline}. [The
United States enjoys]{.underline} what Eric Nordlinger called
"[strategic
immunity]{.underline}."[48](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor048)
Simply put, [most of what happens in the rest of the world is irrelevant
to U.S. national security.]{.underline} The United States has spent
decades helping South Korea keep North Korea in check, for example, but
division of territory on the Korean peninsula does not affect America's
security. Likewise, [civil wars in the Middle East and Russia's
annexation of Crimea might be significant for many reasons,]{.underline}
but [those]{.underline} [events]{.underline} [do not
threaten]{.underline} the ability of [the United States]{.underline} to
defend itself. As a result, [a decision to sell weapons to Ukraine,
Taiwan, or South Korea could significantly affect those nations'
security; doing so is not an act of ensuring U.S. national
security.]{.underline} Nor does the threat of [transnational terrorism
justify most arms sales]{.underline}. Most fundamentally, the actual
threat from Islamist-inspired terrorism to Americans is extraordinarily
low. Since 9/11, neither al Qaeda nor the Islamic State has managed an
attack on the American homeland. Lone wolf terrorists inspired by those
groups have done so, but since 9/11 those attacks have killed fewer than
100 Americans, an average of about 6 people per year. There is simply
very little risk reduction to be gained from any strategy. The idea that
the United States should be willing to accept the significant negative
effects of arms sales for minimal counterterrorism gains is seriously
misguided.[49](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor049)
Moreover, [even if one believed that the benefits would outweigh the
potential costs, arms sales still have almost no value as a tool in the
war on terror for several reasons.]{.underline} First, the [bulk of arms
sales]{.underline} (and those we considered in our risk assessment)
involv[e major conventional weapons, which are ill suited to combatting
terrorism. M]{.underline}any U.S. arms deals since 9/11 have involved
major [conventional weapons systems]{.underline} such as fighter jets,
missiles, and artillery, [useful for traditional military operations,
but of little use in fighting terrorists]{.underline}.
[Insurgencies]{.underline} that hold territory, like the Islamic State,
[are one thing, but most terrorist groups do not advertise their
location, nor do they assemble in large groups.]{.underline} Second,
[there is little evidence]{.underline} from the past 16 years that
direct [military intervention is the right way to combat
terrorism.]{.underline} Research reveals that military force alone
"seldom ends
terrorism."[50](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor050)
This comports with the American experience in Afghanistan, Iraq, and
elsewhere in the war on terror to date. Despite regime change, thousands
of air strikes, and efforts to upgrade the military capabilities of
friendly governments, the United States has not only failed to destroy
the threat of Islamist-inspired terrorism, it has also spawned chaos,
greater resentment, and a sharp increase in the level of terrorism
afflicting the nations
involved.[51](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor051)
Given the experience of the United States since 2001, there is little
reason to expect that additional arms sales to countries like Saudi
Arabia, Pakistan, Qatar, or the United Arab Emirates will reduce
terrorism, much less anti-American terrorism specifically. Relatedly,
[many]{.underline} [arms deals since]{.underline} 9/11, made in the name
of counterterrorism, [were irrelevant to U.S. goals in the global war on
terror because they provided weapons to governments fighting terrorist
groups only vaguely]{.underline} (if at all) [linked to al Qaeda or
ISIS]{.underline}. Although selling weapons to the governments of
Nigeria or Morocco or Tunisia might help them combat violent resistance
in their countries, [terrorist groups in those countries have never
targeted the United States]{.underline}. As a result, such arms deals
cannot be justified by arguing that they advance the goals of the United
States in its own war on terror in any serious way. Finally, arms [sales
are completely useless to combat the largest terrorist threat to the
U.S. homeland]{.underline} --- lone wolf attackers already living in the
United States. As noted, none of the successful attacks in the United
States since 9/11 resulted from operations directed by al Qaeda or ISIS.
And in fact only two foiled attempts since then --- the underwear bomber
and the printer-bomb plot --- can be ascribed to al
Qaeda.[52](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor052)
Instead, in almost all cases, persons already living in the United
States, inspired by Islamist groups, decided to carry out attacks on
their own. Clearly, arms sales to foreign nations won't help with that
problem; rather, as many analysts have suggested, amplifying conflicts
abroad may well make the problem
worse.[53](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor053)
In sum, [the strategic value of arms sales for the United States is very
low given today's security environment]{.underline}. Different
circumstances would produce a different analysis. Although today [there
is little reason for the United States to worry about the Russian threat
to Europe, during the Cold War foreign policy experts agreed that
preventing the Soviet Union from dominating the European continent was
critical to American security]{.underline}. As a result, the United
States sensibly provided NATO allies with advanced weapons. This
strategy greatly enhanced the fighting capability of NATO, thereby
bolstering deterrence and ensuring European security. Today, happily,
the [United States faces no such threats]{.underline}. For this reason,
the [argument in favor of arms sales cannot rest on national security
grounds but must rest instead on "national interest"
grounds]{.underline}, that is, on the benefits gained from helping other
nations improve their own security, and from maintaining conditions
generally believed to be in the national interest, such as regional
stability or the prevention of war. [This is already a much weaker
position than the conventional wisdom acknowledges]{.underline}. Even
worse for such sales' advocates, however, is the fact that arms sales
are notoriously uncertain tools for achieving those objectives.

### t\-- blowback

#### Blowback makes arms sales ineffective and damages regional stability!

Cato's Institute's Defense and Foreign Policy Department, with expertise
in international security and the politics of American national security
and Caroline Dorminey- policy analyst in defense and foreign policy

[Arms Sales Have Many Potential Negative Consequences Though arms sales
are of marginal value to national security and the pursuit of national
interests, their negative consequences are varied and often
severe]{.underline}. [Arms]{.underline} sales can [spawn unwanted
outcomes on three levels: blowback against the United States and
entanglement in conflicts; regional consequences in the buyer's
neighborhood, such as the dispersion of weapons and increased
instability; and consequences for the buyer itself, such as increased
levels of corruption, human rights abuses, and civil
conflict.]{.underline} Effects on the United States. Though the goal of
arms sales is to promote American security and U.S. interests abroad, at
least two possible outcomes can cause serious consequences for the
United States. The first of these --- blowback --- occurs when a former
ally turns into an adversary and uses the weapons against the United
States. The second --- entanglement --- is a process whereby an arms
sales relationship draws the United States into a greater level of
unwanted intervention. [Blowback. The fact that the United States has
sold weapons to almost every nation on earth, combined with frequent
military intervention, means that blowback is an inescapable outcome of
U.S. arms sales policy]{.underline}. American troops and their allies
have faced American-made weapons in almost every military engagement
since the end of the Cold War, including in Panama, Haiti, Somalia,
Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, and Syria. And [even where the United States
has not yet engaged in combat, American arms sales have bolstered the
military capabilities of adversaries once counted as friendly. Blowback
can occur in at least three ways. First, a previously friendly regime
becomes unfriendly]{.underline}. [For example, the United States sold
billions of dollars in weapons to the Shah of Iran during the 1970s in
the hopes that Iran would provide a stabilizing influence on the Middle
East]{.underline}. The sales included everything from fighter jets for
air campaigns to surface-to-air missiles to shoot down enemy
fighters.[70](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor070)
After the 1979 revolution, however, [Iran used those weapons in its war
with Iraq and enabled the new Iranian regime to exert its influence in
the region]{.underline}. Panama, the recipient of decades of American
military assistance, as well as host to a major military base and 9,000
U.S. troops, was a similar case. In 1989, Gen. Manuel Noriega ---
himself a CIA asset for more than 20 years --- took power and threatened
U.S. citizens, prompting a U.S. invasion that featured American troops
facing American
weapons.[71](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor071)
[Blowback also occurs when the United States sells weapons to
nations]{.underline} (or transfers them to nonstate actors)
[that]{.underline}, [though not allies, simply did not register as
potential adversaries at the time of the sale]{.underline}. The United
States, for example, sold surface-to-air missiles, towed guns, tanks,
and armored personnel carriers to Somalia during the 1980s. [Few
officials would have imagined that the United States would find itself
intervening in Somalia]{.underline} in 1992, [or that the United States
and its allies would provide billions in weapons and dual-use equipment
to Iraq in an effort to balance against Iran, only to wind up
confronting Iraq on the battlefield to reverse its annexation of
Kuwait.]{.underline}[72](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor072)
And finally, [blowback can occur when U.S. weapons are sold or stolen
from the government that bought them and wind up on the battlefield in
the hands of the adversary]{.underline}. For example, the Reagan
administration covertly provided Stinger missiles to the Mujahideen, who
were fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan during the 1980s; they in turn
sold them off eventually to Iran and North Korea, among others. [More
recently, the Islamic State managed to capture from the Iraqi
government]{.underline} a stunning number of Humvees and tanks the
United States had sold to Iraq to rebuild its military capabilities
after the 2003 invasion, as well as enough small arms and ammunition to
supply three divisions of a conventional
army.[73](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor073)
**[These examples of blowback demonstrate how difficult it can be to
forecast the long-term outcomes of arms sales and how obvious it is that
selling weapons carries a number of risks.]{.underline}** Predicting
what exactly will happen is hard, but [predicting that arms sales to
clients with red flags are likely to end badly is quite
easy]{.underline}. Iraq was a fragile state ravaged by a decade's worth
of American intervention and rife with terrorism and civil conflict; to
transfer such large quantities of weapons to its military and police
force under such conditions was to invite disaster.

#### Intervention is dangerous---we get stuck defending other countries not tied to US security 

**Thrall and Dorminey 18** (A Trevor Thrall- senior fellow for the
Cato's Institute's Defense and Foreign Policy Department, with expertise
in international security and the politics of American national security

[Entanglement. Arms sales raise the risk of entanglement in two ways.
First, they can represent early steps down the slippery slope to unwise
military intervention.]{.underline} Consider a case like the Syrian
civil war or the many cases during the Cold War in which the United
States wanted to support rebels and freedom fighters against oppressive
governments.[74](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor074)
In the majority of those cases, [American leaders were wary of
intervening directly]{.underline}. Instead, [the United States tended to
rely on money, training, and arms sales. But by taking concrete steps
like arms sales to support rebel groups, Washington's psychological
investment in the outcome tends to rise]{.underline}, [as do the
political stakes for the president, who will be judged on whether his
efforts at support are successful or not]{.underline}. As we saw in the
Syrian civil war, for example, Barack Obama's early efforts to arm
Syrian rebels were roundly criticized as feckless, increasing pressure
on him to intervene more
seriously.[75](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor075)
[History does not provide much guidance about how serious the risk of
this form of entanglement might be]{.underline}. During the Cold War,
presidents from Nixon onward viewed arms sales as a substitute for
sending American troops to do battle with communist forces around the
world. The result was an astonishing amount of weaponry transferred or
sold to Third World nations, many of which were engaged in active
conflicts both external and internal. [The risk of superpower conflict
made it dangerous to intervene directly; accordingly, the Cold War-era
risk of entanglement from arms sales was
low.]{.underline}[76](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor076)
Today, however, the United States does not face nearly as many
constraints on its behavior, as its track record of near-constant
military intervention since the end of the Cold War indicates. As a
result, **[the risk of arms sales helping trigger future military
intervention is real, even if it cannot be measured precisely. The
second way in which arms sales might entangle the United States is by
creating new disputes or exacerbating existing tensions]{.underline}**.
U.S. arms sales to Kurdish units fighting in Syria against the Islamic
State, for example, have ignited tensions between the United States and
its NATO ally Turkey, which sees the Kurds as a serious threat to
Turkish sovereignty and
stability.[77](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor077)
Meanwhile, ongoing arms sales to NATO nations and to other allies like
South Korea and Taiwan have exacerbated tensions with Russia, China, and
North Korea, raising the risk of escalation and the possibility that the
United States might wind up involved in a direct
conflict.[78](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor078)
Regional Effects. Arms sales do not just affect the recipient nation;
they also affect the local balance of power, often causing ripple
effects throughout the region. Though advocates of arms sales trumpet
their stabilizing influence, as we have noted above, arms sales often
lead to greater tension, less stability, and more conflict. Because of
this --- and the complementary problem of weapons dispersion --- the
regional impact of arms sales is less predictable and more problematic
than advocates acknowledge. [Instability, Violence, and Conflict. First,
arms sales can make conflict more
likely]{.underline}.[79](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor079)
[This may occur because recipients of new weapons feel more confident
about launching attacks or because changes in the local balance of power
can fuel tensions and promote preventive strikes by others]{.underline}.
A study of arms sales from 1950 to 1995, for example, found that
although arms sales appeared to have some restraining effect on
major-power allies, they had the opposite effect in other cases, and
concluded that "increased [arms transfers from major powers make states
significantly more likely to be militarized dispute
initiators]{.underline}."[80](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor080)
Another study focused on sub-Saharan Africa from 1967 to 1997 found that
"arms transfers are significant and positive predictors of increased
probability of
war."[81](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor081)
Recent history provides supporting evidence for these findings: since
2011, Saudi Arabia, the leading buyer of American weapons, has
intervened to varying degrees in Yemen, Tunisia, Syria, and Qatar.
**[Second, arms sales can also prolong and intensify ongoing conflicts
and erode rather than promote regional stability]{.underline}**. [Few
governments, and fewer insurgencies, have large enough weapons stocks to
fight for long without
resupply]{.underline}.[82](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor082)
The [tendency of external powers to arm the side they
support]{.underline}, however understandable strategically, [has the
inevitable result of allowing the conflict to continue at a higher level
of intensity than would otherwise be the case.]{.underline} As one study
of arms sales to Africa notes, "Weapons imports are essential additives
in this recipe for armed conflict and
carnage."[83](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor083)
[Third]{.underline}, **[this dynamic appears to be particularly
troublesome with respect to internal conflicts]{.underline}**. Jennifer
Erickson, for example, found that recipients of major conventional
weapons are 70 percent more likely to engage in internal conflicts than
other states. [Though halting arms sales alone is not a panacea for
peace and stability, arms embargoes can help lessen the destructiveness
of combat in both civil and interstate wars simply by restricting access
to the means of
violence]{.underline}.[84](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor084)
[Finally]{.underline}, **[because of their effects on both interstate
and internal conflict, arms sales can also erode rather than promote
regional stability]{.underline}**. As noted in the previous section,
[where the United States seeks to manage regional balances of power,
arms sales often create tension, whether because the American role in
the region threatens others or because American clients feel emboldened.
The Middle East, for example, has seesawed between violence and tense
standoffs for the past many decades]{.underline}, at first because of
Cold War competition and more recently because of the American war on
terror. T[he notion that increased U.S. arms sales since 9/11 made the
Middle East more stable is far-fetched to say the least]{.underline}.
Similarly, [though many argue that American security commitments to
countries like Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea have produced greater
stability, there is a strong case to be made that the opposite is now
true]{.underline}. [American support of South Korea has driven North
Korea to develop nuclear weapons; the presence of U.S. missile defense
systems in South Korea has aggravated China, and American support of
Taiwan produces continual tension between the two
powers]{.underline}.[85](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor085)

### Heg bad- arms races

#### Heg causes international insecurity and arms races -- independently causes protectionism

**Jimin 18** (Chen, Associate Research Fellow, CPC Party School,

Stability]{.underline}**", China-US Focus, 4/13,

DB

First, [the Trump administration regards strategic competition from
great powers as an essential feature of international relations and uses
military force as the main tool for advancing U.S. national
interests]{.underline}. **[This could lead to an escalation of the
"security dilemma" among big countries and thus have a negative impact
on the stability of the international security system]{.underline}**.
[The Trump administration regards China and Russia as "competitors",
"rivals" and "adversaries" and considers the competition from a zero-sum
perspective]{.underline}. [It inevitably worries **China and
Russia**]{.underline}. In addition, the [Trump administration's emphasis
on military means to advance its national security strategy agenda is
likely to trigger some sort of **arms race**]{.underline}. Obviously,
this is not conducive to the improvement of relations among big powers.¶
Second, [the Trump administration views the current international
trading system as a "victim" of free trade and tries to redefine
international trade rules through unilateral actions, thus making the
current **unstable international economic order even
worse**]{.underline}. The Trump administration has raised economic
security as part of national security, which means the US position on
economic issues will be tougher and less compromising. Since taking
office, President [Trump has repeatedly stated that the United States
was taken advantage of in the free trade system]{.underline}. Thus, the
Trump administration renegotiated trade agreements based on the
principle of "fairness and reciprocity," lets domestic law override the
rules of international trade, and increases tariffs to reverse the
foreign trade imbalance. The Trump administration has launched a
"Section 301 investigation" against China and imposed high tariffs on
imported steel and aluminum. [The United States under the Trump
administration is no longer the defender of the international free trade
system]{.underline}. Instead, **[it is an advocate of trade
protectionism, which will shock the system]{.underline}**.¶ Thirdly, the
Trump administration's **[selective engagement in international
mechanisms will erode the authority and stability of the current
international order]{.underline}**. The Trump administration reduced US
funding for international organizations like the UN Population Fund and
urged drastic cuts to peacekeeping funds. [It also withdrew from
existing international mechanisms including the Paris Agreement, UNESCO,
and The Global Compact on Migration]{.underline}. Some scholars, like
Thomas G. Weiss, a professor of political science at City University of
New York, believes that ["America First" actually means "America
Alone"]{.underline}. [Trump's egoism damages America's international
image as well as global public interests]{.underline}. Its indifference
to the voice of the international community not only reflects
unrestrained US power, but also indicates **[the major flaws in global
governance, namely, its dependence on America]{.underline}**. It also
shows [it is high time for the international governance mechanism to be
reformed]{.underline}. [The international community should work together
to build a more representative, balanced, and effective global
governance system that upholds the principle of achieving shared growth
through discussion and collaboration]{.underline}.

DB

The first is that [it's quite easy to manufacture an international
crisis: all a nation has to do is to make some issue---regardless of its
intrinsic worth---a question of prestige or honor]{.underline}; if the
opposing power actually has a vital interest in the question (as Austria
did in November 1912), [or if it merely invests its prestige in the
issue, then all the ingredients for a clash have been
assembled]{.underline}. In the era before the Great War, such conflicts
were called "trials of strength." Today, [game theorists call this sort
of conflict a game of chicken: a test of resolve in which both sides
risk a clash, in the hope the other backs down.]{.underline} Sometimes,
as in November 1912, one driver does swerve; other times, as in July
1914, no one is willing to. But the important point here is that had
Russia simply not made the port question one of honor, its prestige
would never have been engaged. [The allure of power is in its exercise,
but its habitual exercise over nonessential questions almost guarantees
the sort of situation Europe faced in November 1912]{.underline}. The
lesson is that [states should not engage their prestige in nonessential
questions, just as drivers should not play chicken merely to boost their
prestige among their peers or followers.]{.underline}¶ Psychologically,
secondly, the way to justify a trial of strength is to not think
seriously of the consequences. Indeed, the day after Count Kokovtsov
prevented a Russian mobilization, he was noisily opposed by his fellow
ministers of state, who contended that Russia should "firmly defend our
present-day interests, having no fear of the specter of war." This is a
perfect example of "temporal discounting": prestige today felt more
important than peace tomorrow to Russia's ministers. In November 1912,
Kokovtsov angrily railed against this psychological crutch, and was able
to convince the czar and Sazonov, who eventually decided that swerving
was less costly than accelerating. **[Prestige today is worth far less
than the cost of world war tomorrow]{.underline}**. The lesson is that
[even if a state foolishly engages its prestige, it is still more
rational for it to back down than to risk a catastrophic
conflict]{.underline}.¶ [A system based on trials of
strength]{.underline}, finally, [is perilously unstable]{.underline}.
[**This is even truer in complex systems divided into alliance blocs**,
as was prewar Europe]{.underline}. This is what historian Paul Schroeder
meant by picturing prewar Europe as "Galloping Gertie," a reference to
the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which in 1940 collapsed in an orgy of
"aeroelastic flutter." [In the prewar era]{.underline}, traditional
Concert of Europe [diplomacy was being replaced by prestige contests in
which someone had to back down]{.underline}, the [Great Powers were
increasingly unwilling to respect each other's vital interests, and the
leaders of Europe were more concerned with the strength of their
alliance blocs than with the peace of Europe.]{.underline} War was
avoided in November 1912, but [the very nature of Great-Power politics
led to new crises]{.underline} in the spring of 1913 (over Scutari) and
October 1913 (over Albania's northern borders). These, too, were
eventually resolved, but by the time July 1914 rolled around, Europe,
like Galloping Gertie, was fluttering, and [a sharp burst of
wind]{.underline}---the assassination of Franz Ferdinand---[was able to
bring the whole system down with a crash]{.underline}. The lesson is
that **[systems based on trials of strength and alliance solidarity are
unlikely to last, a fact unaltered by the resolution of a few
crises]{.underline}**.¶ Happily, this is the twenty-first century, and
constructed crises, prestige and alliance blocs don't define the
contemporary international system. Right?¶ Wrong. **[Prestige today
typically goes by the moniker]{.underline}** "honor" or
"**[credibility]{.underline}**," and it is certainly still extant. As
for alliances, since the end of the Cold War they have never been so in
vogue. Here at the National Interest, a veritable campaign has been
waged by advocates of a newly empowered "get tough on China" school. The
school's argument is simple. The United States should internally balance
against China by rebalancing its assets to East Asia, by increasing
military investments and by openly planning for war with China. The
United States should externally balance against China by forming
anti-China blocs---the Quad is a common such suggestion---and
strengthening current allies like Japan and the Philippines. The United
States, furthermore, should be more willing to intervene---to invest its
prestige---in East Asian disputes: old questions like Taiwan, yes, but
particularly the new questions of the Senkaku Islands and the South
China Sea.¶ These latter two are indeed new questions. It was not until
1996 that the United States publicly indicated that the Senkakus fell
within the U.S.-Japan Treaty, and it was not until 2010 that a U.S.
Secretary of State (Hillary Clinton) ever verified the claim. As for the
South China Sea, in 1974 and in 1988, [China fought actual battles with
Vietnam over the Paracel and Spratly Islands]{.underline}, in which
hundreds died, but indifference was America's only response. In 2010,
Secretary Clinton (again) shifted U.S. policy by inserting the nation
into the region's territorial disputes as a prelude to her pivot
strategy.¶ Today, the [Washington Consensus is that the United States
should lead Asia by creating blocs like the Trans-Pacific Partnership
that exclude China, by "shaming" China when it acts against the
contemporary wishes of Washington]{.underline} (but, incidentally, as
America historically has acted), [and by investing American prestige in
East Asia's conflicts.]{.underline}¶ [The latent danger of this sort of
international system is that **a crisis will
develop**]{.underline}---say, over Scarborough Shoal, [over which the
United States has apparently laid down a "red line"---that will pit
American prestige and "alliance credibility" against China's perceived
vital interests and supposed "historic rights" in its adjoining
seas]{.underline}. A courageous leader would back down rather than fight
a war over such an insignificant dispute. This is what the Russian czar
did in November 1912, and what President Obama did in (and after) August
2013. But the trouble is that **[even if the first such crisis is
resolved peacefully, afterwards the supposed "humiliation" of backing
down becomes a rallying cry for stronger future resolve]{.underline}**.
This happened to Russia after the Annexation Crisis of 1908--09 and,
indeed, after Russia backed down over its constructed trials of strength
in November 1912, spring 1913 and October 1913. Popular opinion pushes
out prudent statesmen, like Count Kokovtsov, who was forced to resign at
the end of January 1914. Then, [when the next crisis comes along, no
driver is willing to swerve]{.underline}. In July 1914, there was no one
in St. Petersburg to oppose proposals for mobilization. Russia mobilized
at the end of the month, and Germany responded, as Kokovtsov had warned
two years earlier, with actual war.¶ [**Constructed trials of strength,
obsession with prestige ("credibility"), emerging multipolarity and
strengthened alliance blocs today are gradually moving the international
system towards the instability of the pre--World War I era**. The
creation of new flashpoints in the East and South China Seas is the
first stage in this process; this has already happened]{.underline}.
[Strengthened anti-China groupings]{.underline} (both military and
economic) [are the second stage;]{.underline} this is currently under
way. [An intensified arms race with China and simultaneous constructed
crises, typically over "alliance credibility,"]{.underline} are the
third stage. [Cumulative radicalization, following the peaceful
resolution of a few crises]{.underline}, is the fourth stage. It's here
that the system becomes "Galloping Gertie" and statesmen insist on
"firmly" defending "present-day interests, having no fear of the specter
of war." The conflict of 1914 was the "seminal catastrophe" of the
twentieth century. **[There is no reason to suppose the Sino-American
conflict of a decade hence would not be the seminal catastrophe of the
twenty-first]{.underline}**

For all of the loose (frequently hysterical) talk in Congress, the
foreign policy community, and the news media about President Donald
Trump's alleged eagerness to appease Vladimir Putin, [U.S. policy
remains as confrontational as ever toward Russia]{.underline}. Among
other actions, [the Trump administration has involved U.S. forces in
NATO military exercises]{.underline} (war games) [in Poland and other
East European countries on Russia's border, as well as in naval
maneuvers [in the Black
Sea](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_154386.htm) near Russia's
sensitive naval base at Sevastopol]{.underline}. Washington has even
sent U.S. troops as participants in joint military exercises [with
Ukrainian
forces](https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/11/politics/us-troops-ukraine-nato/index.html)---an
act that Moscow considers especially provocative, given its tense
relations with Kiev. [On no issue is the administration's risky course
more evident than its military policy toward Ukraine]{.underline}.
Recent measures are certain to provoke Moscow further, and entangle the
United States to an unwise extent with an extremely murky, ideologically
troubling Ukrainian regime. Secretary of Defense James Mattis
acknowledges that U.S. instructors are [training Ukrainian military
units](https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/1431947/us-troops-training-ukrainian-soldiers-mattis-says/)
at a base in western Ukraine. [Washington also has approved two
important arms sales to Kiev's ground forces in just the past nine
months]{.underline}. The first transaction in December 2017 was limited
to small arms that at least could be portrayed as purely defensive
weapons. That agreement included the export of Model M107A1 Sniper
Systems, ammunition, and associated parts and accessories, a sale valued
at \$41.5 million. [A transaction in April 2018 was more serious. Not
only was it larger]{.underline} [[(\$47
million)](https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-announces-sale-anti-tank-missiles-ukraine-russian/story?id=53450406),
it included far more lethal weaponry, particularly [210 Javelin
anti-tank
missiles](https://www.rferl.org/a/javelin-missile-delivery-ukraine-us-confirmed/29200588.html)]{.underline}---the
kind of weapons that Barack Obama's administration had declined to give
Kiev. Needless to say, the Kremlin [was not
pleased](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russia-issues-stern-warning-us-is-fueling-new-bloodshed-in-ukraine/2017/12/23/7e90f78a-40bf-4967-95f0-af840a23ec63_story.html?utm_term=.d3217d74b629)
about either sale. Moreover, Congress soon passed legislation in May
that authorized \$250 million in military assistance, including lethal
weaponry, to Ukraine in 2019. Congress had twice voted for military
support on a similar scale during the last years of Obama's
administration, but the White House blocked implementation. The [Trump
administration cleared that obstacle out of the way in December 2017 at
the same time that it approved the initial small-weapons
sale]{.underline}. The passage of the May 2018 legislation means that
the path is now open for a dramatic escalation of U.S. military backing
for Kiev. On September 1, former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kurt [Volker
disclosed during an [interview with The
Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/31/ukraine-kurt-volker-us-arms-supplies)
that Washington's future military aid to Kiev would likely involve
weapons sales to Ukraine's air force and navy as well as the
army]{.underline}. "**[The Javelins are mainly symbolic]{.underline}**
and it's not clear if they would ever be used," Aric Toler, a research
scholar at the Atlantic Council,
[asserted](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/31/ukraine-kurt-volker-us-arms-supplies).
One could well dispute his sanguine conclusion, but even Toler conceded:
"Support for the Ukrainian navy and air defence would be a big deal.
That would be far more significant." Volker's cavalier attitude about
U.S. arms sales to a government locked in a crisis with Russia
epitomizes the arrogance and tone-deaf nature of the views that too many
U.S. foreign policy officials exhibit regarding the sensitive Ukraine
issue. "We can have a conversation with Ukraine like we would with any
other country about what do they need. I think that there's going to be
some discussion about naval capability because as you know their navy
was basically taken by Russia \[when the Soviet Union dissolved\]. And
so they need to rebuild a navy and they have very limited air capability
as well. I think we'll have to look at air defence." One suspects that
**[Americans would be incensed at comparable actions by Moscow if the
geo-strategic situations were reversed]{.underline}**. [Imagine if
Russia]{.underline} (even a democratic Russia) [had emerged from the
wreckage of the Cold War as the undisputed global superpower, and a
weakened United States had to watch as the Kremlin expanded a powerful,
Russian-led military alliance to America's borders, conducted alliance
war games within sight of U.S. territory,]{.underline} interfered in
Canada's internal political affairs to oust a democratically elected
pro-American government, and then pursued [growing military ties with
the new, anti-U.S. government in Ottawa. Yet that would be]{.underline}
disturbingly [similar to what Washington has done regarding NATO policy
and U.S. relations with Ukraine]{.underline}. [The Much Diminished

Moreover, although Kiev's cheerleaders in the Western (especially U.S.)
media like to portray Ukraine as a beleaguered democracy that plays the
role of David to Russia's evil Goliath, the reality is far murkier.
Putin's government overstates matters when it alleges that Ukraine's
2014 Maidan revolution was a U.S.-orchestrated coup that brought
outright fascists to power in Kiev. Nevertheless, that version contains
more than a little truth. Prominent, powerful U.S. figures, most notably
the late Senator John McCain and Assistant Secretary of State for
European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland, [openly
sided](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/americas-ukraine-hypocrisy)
with demonstrators seeking to unseat Ukraine's elected government.
Indeed, Nuland was [caught on
tape](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26079957) with U.S.
Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt scheming about the desired
composition of a new government in Kiev. It is unfair to portray
Ukraine's current administration led by President Petro Poroshenko as a
neo-fascist regime. Post-revolution elections appear to have been
reasonably free and fair, and there are major factions that are
committed to genuine democratic values. But Ukraine also is hardly a
model of Western-style democracy. Not only is it afflicted with
extensive graft and corruption, but some extreme nationalist and even
[neo-Nazi
groups](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cohen-ukraine-commentary/commentary-ukraines-neo-nazi-problem-idUSKBN1GV2TY)
play a significant role in the "new" Ukraine. The notoriously fascist
Azov Battalion, for example, continues to occupy a prominent position in
Kiev's efforts to defeat separatists in Ukraine's eastern Donbass
region. Alexander Zakharchenko, prime minister of the self-declared
Donetsk People's Republic in the pro-Russia rebel-occupied city of
Donetsk, [was assassinated on September
1](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/pro-russian-rebel-leader-killed-in-eastern-ukraine-blast/2018/08/31/12a18336-ad37-11e8-b1da-ff7faa680710_story.html?utm_term=.fc482a2c6bab)
and officials there and in Russia are blaming Kiev. The Ukrainian
government has denied involvement. Other ultranationalist factions act
as domestic militias that attempt to intimidate more moderate
Ukrainians. Even the Poroshenko government itself has adopted troubling
censorship measures and other autocratic policies. Officials in both the
Obama and Trump administration have taken a much too casual attitude
toward [U.S.
cooperation](https://www.thenation.com/article/americas-collusion-with-neo-nazis/)
with extremist elements and a deeply flawed Ukrainian government. [Both
the danger of stoking tensions with Moscow and becoming too close to a
regime in Kiev that exhibits disturbing features should caution the
Trump administration against boosting military aid to
Ukraine.]{.underline} It is an unwise policy on strategic as well as
moral grounds. Trump [administration officials should refuse to be
intimidated or stampeded into forging a risky and unsavory alliance with
Kiev out of fear of being portrayed as excessively "soft" toward
Russia]{.underline}. Instead, the president and his advisers need to
spurn efforts to increase U.S. support for Ukraine[. A good place to
start would be to restore the Obama administration's refusal to approve
arms sales to Kiev]{.underline}. **[Washington must not pour gasoline on
a geo-strategic fire that could lead to a full-blown crisis between the

policy that states should axiomatically adopt]{.underline}. Spreading
liberal democracy around the world is said to make eminently good sense
from both a moral and a strategic perspective. For starters, it is
thought to be an excellent way to protect human rights, which are
sometimes seri­ously violated by authoritarian states. And because the
policy holds that liberal democracies do not want to go to war with each
other, it ultimately provides a formula for transcending realism and
fostering international peace. Finally, proponents claim it helps
protect liberalism at home by eliminating authoritarian states that
otherwise might aid the illiberal forces that are constantly present
inside the liberal state. **[This conventional wisdom is
wrong]{.underline}**. **[Great powers are rarely in a position to pursue
a full­-scale liberal foreign policy]{.underline}**. **[As long as two or
more of them exist on the planet, they have little choice but to pay
close attention to their position in the global balance of power and act
according to the dictates of realism]{.underline}**. [Great powers of
all persuasions care deeply about their survival, and there is always
the danger in a bipolar or multipolar system that they will be attacked
by another great power]{.underline}. In these circumstances, [liberal
great powers regularly dress up their hard­-nosed behavior with liberal
rhe­toric]{.underline}. **[They talk like liberals and act like
realists]{.underline}**. [Should they adopt liberal policies that are at
odds with realist logic, they invariably come to regret it]{.underline}.
But occasionally a liberal democracy encounters such a favorable balance
of power that it is able to embrace liberal hegemony. That situation is
most likely to arise in a unipolar world, where the single great power
does not have to worry about being attacked by another great power since
there is none. Then the liberal sole pole will almost always abandon
realism and adopt a liberal foreign policy. Liberal states have a
crusader mentality hard­-wired into them that is hard to restrain.
[Because liberalism prizes the concept of inalienable or natural rights,
committed liberals are deeply concerned about the rights of virtually
every individual on the planet]{.underline}. **[This universalist logic
creates a powerful incen­tive for liberal states to get involved in the
affairs of countries that seriously violate their citizens'
rights]{.underline}**. To take this a step further, the best way to
ensure that the rights of foreigners are not trampled is for them to
live in a liberal democracy. **[This logic leads straight to an active
policy of regime change, where the goal is to topple autocrats and put
liberal democracies in their place]{.underline}**. [Liberals do not shy
from this task, mainly because they often have great faith in their
state's ability to do social engineering both at home and
abroad]{.underline}. Creating a world populated by liberal democracies
is also thought to be a formula for international peace, which would not
just eliminate war but greatly reduce, if not eliminate, the twin
scourges of nuclear prolifera­tion and terrorism. And lastly, it is an
ideal way of protecting liberalism at home. [This enthusiasm
notwithstanding, **liberal hegemony will not achieve its goals, and its
failure will inevitably come with huge costs**]{.underline}. [The
liberal state is likely to end up fighting endless wars, which will
increase rather than reduce the level of conflict in international
politics and thus aggravate the problems of proliferation and
terrorism]{.underline}. Moreover, [the state's militaristic behavior is
almost certain to end up threatening its own liberal
values]{.underline}. **[Liber­alism abroad leads to illiberalism at
home]{.underline}**. Finally, **[even if the liberal state were to
achieve its aims---spreading democracy near and far, fostering eco­nomic
intercourse, and creating international institutions---they would not
produce peace]{.underline}**. The key to understanding liberalism's
limits is to recognize its relation­ship with nationalism and realism.
This book is ultimately all about these three isms and how they interact
to affect international politics. [Nationalism is an enormously powerful
political ideology]{.underline}. It revolves around the division of the
world into a wide variety of nations, which are formidable social units,
each with a distinct culture. Virtually every nation would prefer to
have its own state, although not all can. Still, [we live in a world
populated almost exclusively by nation­-states, which means that
liberalism must coexist with nationalism]{.underline}. Liberal states
are also nation­states. [There is no question that liberalism and
nationalism can coexist, but when they clash, nationalism almost always
wins]{.underline}. [The influence of nationalism often undercuts a
liberal foreign policy]{.underline}. For example, [nationalism places
great emphasis on self­-determination, which means that most countries
will resist a liberal great power's efforts to inter­fere in their
domestic politics---which, of course, is what liberal hegemony is all
about]{.underline}. These two isms also clash over individual rights.
Liberals be­lieve everyone has the same rights, regardless of which
country they call home. Nationalism is a particularist ideology from top
to bottom, which means it does not treat rights as inalienable. In
practice, the vast majority of people around the globe do not care
greatly about the rights of individu­als in other countries. They are
much more concerned about their fellow citizens' rights, and even that
commitment has limits. Liberalism oversells the importance of individual
rights. **[Liberalism is also no match for realism]{.underline}**. At
its core, [liberalism assumes that the individuals who make up any
society sometimes have profound differences about what constitutes the
good life, and these differences might lead them to try to kill each
other]{.underline}. [Thus a state is needed to keep the
peace]{.underline}. But **[there is no world state to keep countries at
bay when they have profound disagreements]{.underline}**. **[The
structure of the international system is anar­chic, not hierarchic, which
means that liberalism applied to international politics cannot
work]{.underline}**. [Countries thus have little choice but to act
according to balance-­of-­power logic if they hope to
survive]{.underline}. There are special cases, however, where a country
is so secure that it can take a break from realpolitik and pursue truly
liberal policies. The results are almost always bad, largely because
nationalism thwarts the liberal crusader. My argument, stated briefly,
is that [nationalism and realism almost always trump
liberalism]{.underline}. Our world has been shaped in good part by those
two powerful isms, not by liberalism. [Consider that five hundred years
ago the political universe was remarkably heterogeneous; it included
city­-states, duchies, empires, principalities, and assorted other
political forms]{.underline}. [That world has given way to **a globe
populated almost exclusively by nation­ states**]{.underline}. Although
many factors caused this great transformation, two of **[the main
driving forces behind the modern state system were nationalism and
balance-­of-­power politics]{.underline}**. The American Embrace of
Liberal Hegemony This book is also motivated by a desire to understand
recent American foreign policy. The United States is a deeply liberal
country that emerged from the Cold War as by far the most powerful state
in the international system. 1 The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991
left it in an ideal position to pursue liberal hegemony. 2 The American
foreign policy establishment em­ braced that ambitious policy with little
hesitation, and with abundant opti­mism about the future of the United
States and the world. At least at first, the broader public shared this
enthusiasm. The zeitgeist was captured in Francis Fukuyama's famous
article, "The End of History?," published just as the Cold War was
coming to a close. 3 Liberalism, he argued, defeated fascism in the
first half of the twentieth century and communism in the second half,
and now there was no viable alternative left standing. The world would
eventually be entirely populated by liberal democracies. According to
Fukuyama, these nations would have virtually no meaningful disputes, and
wars between great powers would cease. The biggest problem confronting
people in this new world, he suggested, might be boredom. [It was also
widely believed at the time that the spread of liberalism would
ultimately bring an end to balance-­of-­power politics]{.underline}. The
harsh security competition that has long characterized great-­power
relations would dis­appear, and realism, long the dominant intellectual
paradigm in inter­national relations, would land on the scrap heap of
history. "In a world where freedom, not tyranny, is on the march," Bill
Clinton proclaimed while campaigning for the White House in 1992, "the
cynical calculus of pure power politics simply does not compute. It is
ill­-suited to a new era in which ideas and information are broadcast
around the globe before ambas­sadors can read their cables." [Probably no
recent president embraced the mission of spreading liberal­ism more
enthusiastically than George W. Bush, who said in a speech in March
2003, two weeks before the invasion of Iraq]{.underline}: "[The current
Iraqi re­gime has shown the power of tyranny to spread discord and
violence in the Middle East]{.underline}. [A liberated Iraq can show the
power of freedom to transform that vital region, by bringing hope and
progress into the lives of millions]{.underline}. America's interests in
security, and America's belief in liberty, both lead in the same
direction: to a free and peaceful Iraq." Later that year, on September
6, he proclaimed: "The advance of freedom is the calling of our time; it
is the calling of our country. From the Fourteen Points to the Four
Freedoms, to the Speech at Westminster, America has put our power at the
service of principle. We believe that liberty is the design of nature;
we be­lieve that liberty is the direction of history. We believe that
human fulfill­ment and excellence come in the responsible exercise of
liberty. And we believe that freedom---the freedom we prize---is not for
us alone, it is the right and the capacity of all mankind." Something
went badly wrong. **[Most people's view of U.S. foreign policy today, in
2018, is starkly different from what it was in 2003, much less the early
1990s]{.underline}**. **[Pessimism, not optimism, dominates most
assessments of America's accomplishments during its holiday from
realism]{.underline}**. [Under Presi­dents Bush and Barack Obama,
Washington has played a key role in sow­ing death and destruction across
the greater Middle East, and there is little evidence the mayhem will
end anytime soon]{.underline}. American policy toward Ukraine, motivated
by liberal logic, is principally responsible for the ongo­ing crisis
between Russia and the West. [The United States has been at war for two
out of every three years since 1989, fighting seven different
wars]{.underline}. We should not be surprised by this. Contrary to the
prevailing wisdom in the West, a **[liberal foreign policy is not a
formula for cooperation and peace but for instability and
conflict]{.underline}**. In this book I focus on [the period between
1993 and 2017, when the Clinton, Bush, and Obama administrations, each
in control of American foreign policy for eight years, were fully
committed to pursuing liberal hegemony]{.underline}. Although President
Obama had some reservations about that policy, they mattered little for
how his administration actually acted abroad. I do not consider the
Trump administration for two reasons. First, as I was finishing this
book it was difficult to determine what President
**[Trump]{.underline}**'s foreign policy would look like, although it is
clear from his rhetoric during the 2016 campaign that he **[recognizes
that liberal hegemony has been an abject failure and would like to
abandon key elements of that strategy]{.underline}**. Second, **[there
is good reason to think that with the rise of China and the res­urrection
of Russian power having put great power politics back on the table,
Trump eventually will have no choice but to move toward a grand strategy
based on realism, even if doing so meets with considerable resistance at
home]{.underline}**.

Affairs in the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs

<https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/gji3/files/why_the_liberal_world_order_will_survive.pdf>

In this essay I look at the evolving encounters between rising states
and the post-war Western international order. My starting point is the
classic "power transition" perspective[. Power transition theories see a
tight link between international order---]{.underline}its emergence,
stability, and decline---[and the rise and fall of great
powers.]{.underline} It is a perspective that sees history as a sequence
of cycles in which powerful or hegemonic states rise up and build order
and dominate the global system until their power declines, leading to a
new cycle of crisis and order building. In contrast, I offer a more
evolutionary perspective, emphasizing the lineages and continuities in
modern international order. More specifically, I argue that [although
America's hegemonic position may be declining]{.underline}, **[the
liberal international characteristics of order---openness, rules,
multilateral cooperation---are deeply rooted and likely to
persist.]{.underline}** [This is true ev**en though the orientation and
actions of the Trump administration** have raised serious questions
about the U.S. commitment to liberal internationalism. Just as
importantly, rising states (led by **China**) **are not engaged in a
frontal attack** on the American-led order.]{.underline} [While
struggles do exist over orientations, agendas, and leadership, **the
non-Western developing countries remain tied** to the architecture and
principles of a liberal-oriented global orde]{.underline}r. And [even as
China seeks in various ways to build rival regional institutions,
**there are stubborn limits on what it can do.**]{.underline} Power
Transitions and International Order There is wide agreement that the
world is witnessing a long-term global power transition. [Wealth and
power is diffusing, spreading outward and away from Europe and the
United States.]{.underline} [The rapid growth that marked the
non-Western rising states in the last decade may have ended, and even
China's rapid economic ascendency has slowed]{.underline}. But [the
overall pattern of change remains: the "rest" are gaining ground on the
"West."]{.underline} While there is wide agreement that the world is
witnessing a global power transition, there is less agreement on the
consequences of power shifts for international order. The classic view
is advanced by realist scholars, such as E. H. Carr, Robert Gilpin, Paul
Kennedy, and William Wohlforth, who make sweeping arguments about power
and order. These [hegemonic realists argue that international order is
a by-product of the concentration of power]{.underline}. Order is
created by a powerful state, and when that state declines and power
diffuses, international order weakens or breaks apart. Out of these
dynamic circumstances, a rising state emerges as the new dominant state,
and it seeks to reorganize the international system to suit its own
purposes. In this view, world politics from ancient times to the modern
era can be seen as a series of repeated cycles of rise and decline. War,
protectionism, depression, political upheaval---various sorts of crises
and disruptions may push the cycle forward. This narrative of hegemonic
rise and decline draws on the European and, more broadly, Western
experience. Since the early modern era, Europe has been organized and
reorganized by a succession of leading states and would-be hegemons: the
Spanish Hapsburgs, France of Louis XIV and Napoleon, and post-Bismarck
Germany. [The logic of hegemonic order comes even more clearly into view
with Pax Britannica]{.underline}, the nineteenth-century hegemonic order
based on British naval and mercantile dominance. The decline of Britain
was followed by decades of war and economic instability, which ended
only with the rise of Pax Americana. [For hegemonic realists, the debate
today is about where the world is along this cyclical pathway of rise
and decline. Has the United States finally lost the ability or
willingness to underwrite and lead the post-war order?]{.underline} Are
we in the midst of a hegemonic crisis and the breakdown of the old
order? And are rising states, led by China, beginning to step forward in
efforts to establish their own hegemonic dominance of their regions and
the world? These are the lurking questions of the power transition
perspective. **[But does this vision of power transition truly
illuminate the struggles going on today over international
order?]{.underline}** [Some might argue no---that the United States is
still in a position, despite its travails, to provide hegemonic
leadership]{.underline}. Here one would note that [there is a durable
infrastructure (or what Susan Strange has called "structural power")
that undergirds the existing American-led order]{.underline}.
[Far-flung security alliances, market relations, liberal democratic
solidarity, deeply rooted geopolitical alignments---there are many
possible sources of American hegemonic power that remain
intact]{.underline}. **[But there may be even deeper sources of
continuity in the existing system.]{.underline}** This would be true if
the existence of a liberal-oriented international order does not in fact
require hegemonic domination. It might be that the **[power transition
theory is wrong: the stability and persistence of the existing post-war
international order does not depend on the concentration of American
power.]{.underline}** In fact, [international order is not simply an
artifact of concentrations of power]{.underline}. The **[rules and
institutions that make up international order have a more complex and
contingent relationship with the rise and fall of state
power]{.underline}**. This is true in two respects. First,
[international order itself is complex: multilayered, multifaceted, and
not simply a political formation imposed by the leading
state]{.underline}. [International order is not "one thing" that states
either join or resist. It is an aggregation of various sorts of ordering
rules and institutions]{.underline}. **[There are the deep rules and
norms of sovereignty. There are governing institutions]{.underline}**,
starting with the United Nations. **[There is a sprawling array of
international institutions, regimes, treaties, agreements, protocols,
and so forth]{.underline}**. These governing arrangements cut across
diverse realms, including security and arms control, the world economy,
the environment and global commons, human rights, and political
relations. [Some of these domains of governance may have rules and
institutions that narrowly reflect the interests of the hegemonic state,
but most reflect negotiated outcomes based on a much broader set of
interests. As rising states continue to rise]{.underline}, they do not
simply confront an American-led order; [they face a wider conglomeration
of ordering rules, institutions, and arrangements; many of which they
have long embraced**. By separating "American hegemony" from "the
existing international order," we can see a more complex set of
relationships.** The United States **does not embody the international
order;** it has a relationship with it, as do rising
states]{.underline}. [The United States embraces many of the core global
rules and institutions]{.underline}, such as the United Nations,
International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and World Trade
Organization. [But it also has resisted ratification of the Law of the
Sea Convention and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (it being
the only country not to have ratified the latter) as well as various
arms control and disarmament agreements.]{.underline} [China also
embraces many of the same global rules and institutions, and resists
ratification of others]{.underline}. Generally speaking, the more
fundamental or core the norms and institutions are---beginning with the
Westphalian norms of sovereignty and the United Nations system---the
more agreement there is between the United States and China as well as
other states. Disagreements are most salient where human rights and
political principles are in play, such as in the Responsibility to
Protect. [Second, there is also diversity in what rising states "want"
from the international order. T]{.underline}he struggles over
international order take many different forms. In some instances, what
rising states want is more influence and control of territory and
geopolitical space beyond their borders. One can see this in China's
efforts to expand its maritime and political influence in the South
China Sea and other neighboring areas. This is an age-old type of
struggle captured in realist accounts of security competition and
geopolitical rivalry. Another type of struggle is over the norms and
values that are enshrined in global governance rules and institutions.
These may be about how open and rule-based the system should be. They
may also be about the way human rights and political principles are
defined and brought to bear in relations among states. Finally, the
struggles over international order may be focused on the distribution of
authority. That is, rising states may seek a greater role in the
governance of existing institutions. This is a struggle over the
position of states within the global political hierarchy: voting shares,
leadership rights, and authority relations. [These observations cut
against the realist hegemonic perspective and cyclical theories of power
transition]{.underline}. **[Rising states do not confront a single,
coherent, hegemonic order.]{.underline}** [The international order
offers a buffet of options and choices. They can embrace some rules and
institutions and not others]{.underline}. Moreover, stepping back, [the
international orders that rising states have faced in different
historical eras have not all been the same order]{.underline}. The
British-led order that Germany faced at the turn of the twentieth
century is different from the international order that China faces
today. [The contemporary international order is much more complex and
wide-ranging than past orders]{.underline}. **[It has a much denser
array of rules, institutions, and governance realms]{.underline}**.
There are also both regional and global domains of governance. **[This
makes it hard to imagine an epic moment when the international order
goes into crisis and rising states step forward---either China alone or
rising states as a bloc---to reorganize and reshape its rules and
institutions]{.underline}**. Rather than a cyclical dynamic of rise and
decline, [change in the existing American-led order might best be
captured by terms such as continuity, evolution, adaptation, and
negotiation. **The struggles over international order today are growing,
but it is not a drama best told in terms of the rise and decline of
American hegemony.**]{.underline}

### AT revisionism -- Russia 

**No Russia threat -- it's just perception**

**Grobe 16** (Anna Mulrine Grobe -- Staff Writer for CS Monitor,
8/29/16, "How big a military threat is Russia, really?"
<https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2016/0829/How-big-a-military-threat-is-Russia-really>)

In a recent talk at one of America's premier war colleges, the nation's
top military officer warned incoming students about the dangers of
Russian aggression. Gen. Joe Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, pointed to Russia's annexation of Crimea, its meddling in
Ukraine, and its aid to the Syrian regime. Even in the face of a severe
economic squeeze, \"they are modernizing their nuclear enterprise, they
are modernizing their submarine force,\" he said. Such warnings have
become increasingly dire in foreign policy circles. Is Russia really the
dire military threat that it\'s made out to be? **[Many longtime Russia
analysts concur that]{.underline}** there is certainly a role for a
robust military posture but that **[Russia\'s moves don\'t merit the
level of alarm that they have generated.]{.underline}** Russian
President Vladimir **[Putin]{.underline}** has made it clear that he
**[has "no interest in challenging our military]{.underline}** **[where
we make it clear we don't want to be challenged,"]{.underline}** says
Olga Oliker, director of the Russia and Eurasia program at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. **[Instead, "the
Russians]{.underline}** are terrified of us. **[They see themselves as
pushing back against US hegemony]{.underline}** -- and they really do
see this, this isn't just rhetoric\.... We are what they build against."
**[For]{.underline}** **[just this reason]{.underline}**, the
**[Russians have been]{.underline}** beefing up their conventional
arsenal, **[building hypersonic missiles and new
submarines]{.underline}**. **[Russia's moves]{.underline}** to date
"**[have been select and calibrated]{.underline}**," write retired Gen.
David Petraeus, former head of the CIA, and Michael O'Hanlon, a defense
analyst at the Brookings Institution, in this month's Foreign Affairs
magazine. **[Crimea]{.underline}**, after all, **[was historically
Russian and "is populated by]{.underline}** a majority of **[Russian
speakers]{.underline}**, and is home to Russia's only Black Sea naval
base." What's more, **[when]{.underline}** Mr. **[Putin moved into
Syria]{.underline}** last fall, "**[He did so only after having
determined that]{.underline}** the **[Obama]{.underline}**
administration **[was keeping its own]{.underline}** **[involvement
limited]{.underline}**," they argue. While these actions "may have been
cynical and reprehensible" they "were not completely reckless or random,
nor were they particularly brutal by the standards of warfare." **[In
short]{.underline}**, they conclude, **[Russia's actions "do
not]{.underline}** likely **[portend a]{.underline}** direct
**[threat]{.underline}** to more central NATO interests." The debate
comes as the West generally and the US in particular decides how to
counter Russia\'s increasingly bold moves -- on a number of threat
levels. Where conventional forces are concerned, the US military is
quickly becoming the force charged with "serving as a strong deterrent
to Russian aggression," the director of strategy for US European
Command, Maj. Gen. David Allvin, said last month. This warning comes, as
such military warnings generally do, with a hefty \$3.4 billion request
in the Pentagon's latest budget for the so-called European Reassurance
Initiative that will, among other things, fund the deployment of more US
troops and weapons to Europe. Few analysts suggest the US should do
nothing. The debate is over how forcefully to react. With US Army troop
levels down to 30,000 in Europe, it makes sense to beef up the forces
there, General Petraeus and Mr. O'Hanlon write. But "**[stationing a
major]{.underline}** NATO **[force in the Baltics]{.underline}** ...
**[not only is unnecessary but also could provoke Putin as easily as
deter him]{.underline}**, given his temperament and his desire to
restore Russia's status.\"

### [AT revisionism -- china]{.underline} 

**China isn't revisionist and are only emboldened by US hegemony**

**Lind, 2-13-17** - (Jennifer, Associate Professor of Government at
Dartmouth, \"Asia\'s Other Revisionist Power,\" Foreign Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/2017-02-13/asias-other-revisionist-power)

Donald Trump's election as U.S. president threatens to upend the world's
most important bilateral relationship. On the campaign trail, Trump
promised to label China a currency manipulator and to respond to its
"theft of American trade secrets" and "unfair subsidy behavior" by
levying a 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports. As president-elect, he
reversed four decades of U.S. policy when he spoke by telephone with
Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and declared that the United States was
not bound by the "one China" policy, the diplomatic understanding that
has underpinned Washington's approach to Beijing since 1979. Trump's
actions, however, have only compounded deeper problems in the
Sino-American relationship. Recent Chinese policies have fueled concerns
that the country seeks to overturn the post--Cold War geopolitical
order. President Xi Jinping has begun to modernize China's military,
gradually transforming the regional balance of power. He has pursued
assertive policies in the East China and South China Seas, appearing to
reject both the territorial status quo in East Asia and the role of
international law in adjudicating disputes. Many observers now believe
that efforts to integrate China into the international system have
failed and that East Asia will have to contend with a dangerous,
revisionist power. But **[China is not the only revisionist power in the
U.S.-Chinese relationship]{.underline}**. Since the end of World War II,
**[the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[has pursued a
strategy aimed at overturning the status quo by spreading liberalism,
free markets, and U.S. influence around the world]{.underline}**. Just
as Chinese revisionism alarms Washington, **[the United States' posture
stokes fear in Beijing and beyond. As Trump begins his presidency, he
would do well to understand this fear]{.underline}**. The risk of
crises, and even war, will grow if Trump introduces instability into
areas of the relationship that posed few problems under previous U.S.
administrations. But Trump could ease tensions if he pursues a less
revisionist strategy than his predecessors. SEA CHANGE **[Chinese
policymakers deny that their country is a revisionist
power]{.underline}**. They claim that **[China seeks merely to defend a
regional status quo that the United States is
threatening]{.underline}**. After all, **[they argue, China's claims to
many of the region's disputed islands date back
centuries]{.underline}**. For example, Yang Yanyi, China's ambassador to
the European Union, wrote in a 2016 op-ed that China has enjoyed
"sovereignty over the South China Sea Island . . . and the adjacent
waters since ancient times." **[Chinese policymakers point out that the
"nine-dash line," a demarcation of Chinese claims that runs along the
edge of the South China Sea, has appeared on Chinese maps since the
1940s]{.underline}**. "**[China's relevant claims have never exceeded
the scope of the current international order,"]{.underline}** China's
ambassador to the United Kingdom, Liu Xiaoming, argued in a 2016 speech
criticizing the decision by an international tribunal in The Hague to
rule against China in the South China Sea dispute. "**[China's rejection
of the arbitration is to uphold the postwar international
order]{.underline}**," he said. According to Beijing, the South China
Sea has always been, and will always be, Chinese territory; **[China, in
other words, remains a status quo power, not a revisionist
one.]{.underline}** But even if its territorial claims are not new,
China rarely sought to enforce them until recently. For the past few
years, however, China has grown increasingly assertive in its
territorial disputes. In 2012, to the dismay of Tokyo and Washington,
Beijing declared an "air defense identification zone" over the Senkaku
Islands (known in China as the Diaoyu Islands), which are currently
controlled by Japan but which China also claims, requiring aircraft
flying through the zone to identify themselves to Chinese authorities.
That same year, China maneuvered the Philippines out of Scarborough
Shoal---a reef just over 100 miles from the Philippines and more than
500 miles from China. Today, its navy, coast guard, and "maritime
militia" of fishing boats deny Philippine vessels access to the area.
Meanwhile, China has presided over an extraordinary construction project
in the South China Sea, building a string of artificial islands. As the
Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, a website that monitors activity
in the disputed territory, has noted, "The number, size, and
construction make it clear these are for military purposes---and they
are the smoking gun that shows China has every intention of militarizing
the Spratly Islands," a contested archipelago. China has drilled for oil
in the waters of the contested Paracel Islands, ignoring Vietnamese
protests and keeping Vietnamese ships away from the area. Last year,
China sent a swarm of approximately 230 fishing boats, escorted by coast
guard ships, into the waters around the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands, and it
has also escalated the situation by sending more powerful military
forces into the area, such as a frigate and an air force bomber. What's
more, over the past few years, **[China has modernized its
military]{.underline}**. According to Captain James Fanell, the former
chief of intelligence for the U.S. Pacific Fleet, China is building
coast guard vessels "at an astonishing rate," some of which are among
the largest coast guard ships in the world. China is also improving its
conventional ballistic missiles, which threaten U.S. air bases and ports
in the region, including Andersen Air Force Base, on Guam, a crucial
U.S. military hub. These moves jeopardize the entire U.S. strategy for
projecting power in East Asia. **[In the eyes of all but Beijing, this
clearly counts as revisionist behavior.]{.underline}** And **[it has
touched off a flurry of activity among countries that feel
threatened.]{.underline}** The Philippines, although possibly moving
closer to China under President Rodrigo Duterte, has challenged China's
territorial claims in an international tribunal. Australia has
strengthened its military and deepened its alliance with the United
States. Singapore, not a U.S. treaty ally but a longtime U.S. partner,
has increased its defense spending and has begun to work more closely
with the U.S. Navy. Despite the legacy of the Vietnam War, Hanoi and
Washington have begun to move toward closer security cooperation.
Chinese behavior has also shocked Japan into action. Japanese leaders
have rejected military statecraft for more than half a century. But
under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japan has reinterpreted (and may
eventually revise) its constitution to permit more military activism and
is forging closer ties with other countries worried about Chinese
revisionism, including Australia and India. So far, **[Japan's response
to China has been restrained]{.underline}**. Although changes in the
Japanese defense posture often generate alarmist headlines, Japan's
actions to date have been modest, especially when compared with how
great powers normally behave when confronted by a rising power in their
neighborhood. The Japanese public is preoccupied with a lagging economy
and an aging society; it has no interest in military statecraft and has
disapproved of the security reforms pushed by Abe and other
conservatives. But as the world's third-largest economy, Japan has
tremendous latent power; a sufficiently alarmed Tokyo could decide to
increase its military spending from the current one percent of GDP to
two or three percent---an undesirable outcome for Beijing. Chinese
officials argue that U.S. interference has caused its neighbors to
respond with alarm, but China's own revisionism is to blame. Consider
that for the past 60 years, even as Washington constantly entreated
Japan to play a more active military role in the U.S.-Japanese alliance,
Tokyo stepped up only when it felt threatened, as it did in the late
1970s when the Soviet Union launched a military buildup in Asia. Today,
Japan is responding not to U.S. pressure but to Chinese assertiveness.
Beijing must understand how threatening its actions appear if it wishes
to successfully manage its relations with its neighbors and with
Washington. POT, MEET KETTLE Like **[their Chinese counterparts, U.S.
foreign policy officials argue that the United States seeks merely to
uphold the status quo in East Asia. They want to maintain military
predominance in the region through the policy of a "rebalance" to Asia,
prevent a return to an era when countries settled disputes unilaterally
and by force, and support freedom of navigation and the law of the
sea.]{.underline}** In its desire to preserve the current global
economic system and its network of military alliances, the United States
does favor the status quo. **[But at its heart, U.S. grand strategy
seeks to spread liberalism and U.S. influence]{.underline}**. The goal,
in other words, is not preservation but transformation. After World War
II, **[the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[formed a
network of partners, supported by military alliances and international
institutions, and sought to expand it.]{.underline}** Prosperity and
peace, created through trade and institutions, would prevail among the
members of the liberal zone. As democracy and economic interdependence
deepened, and as the zone widened, war would become less likely and
respect for human rights would spread. Washington sought to pull
countries into its orbit, regardless of whether they accepted its
values. In time, perhaps engagement with the United States and with the
liberal order would encourage the spread of liberalism to those
countries, too. "**[The West]{.underline}** was not just a geographical
region with fixed borders," the scholar G. John Ikenberry has written.
"Rather, it **[was an idea---a universal organizational form that could
expand outward, driven by the spread of liberal democratic government
and principles of conduct]{.underline}**." **[The
strategy]{.underline}**, to be sure, had elements of self-interest:
Washington sought to create a liberal order that it itself led. But it
also **[had a]{.underline}** more **[revolutionary goal: the
transformation of anarchy into order.]{.underline}** The United States
has pursued this transformational grand strategy all over the world. In
Europe, after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United
States and its allies did not preserve the status quo. Instead, they
pushed eastward, enlarging NATO to absorb all of the Soviet Union's
former Warsaw Pact allies and some former Soviet territories, such as
the Baltic states. At the same time, the European Union expanded into
eastern Europe. In Ukraine, U.S. and European policymakers encouraged
the overthrow of a pro-Russian government in 2014 and helped install a
Western-leaning one. In the Middle East, U.S. policymakers saw the 2003
invasion of Iraq as an opportunity to advance democracy in the region.
During the Arab Spring, they viewed the uprising in Libya as another
chance to replace an anti-American dictator, and they encouraged the
spread of democracy elsewhere as well. Underlying the United States'
recent engagement with Iran is a desire to promote liberalization there,
too. In East Asia, the United States has not only maintained and
strengthened its longtime alliances with Australia, Japan, and the
Philippines but also courted new partners, such as Malaysia and
Singapore. And with its policy toward Vietnam, the United States may
encourage a dramatic change in the regional status quo. Historically,
Vietnam, which borders China, has fallen within its larger neighbor's
sphere of influence, and since the Vietnam War, its relations with the
United States have been bitter. In the past few years, however, Vietnam
and the United States have deepened their economic ties, resolved
previous disputes, and even explored greater security cooperation.
Vietnam is also expanding its military ties with U.S. allies---namely,
Australia, Japan, and the Philippines. In each of these regions, U.S.
diplomatic, economic, and military policies are aimed not at preserving
but at transforming the status quo. "A country is one of three colors:
blue, red, or gray," the Japanese journalist Hiroyuki Akita said in 2014
at a talk at the Sasakawa Peace Foundation, in Tokyo. "China wants to
turn the gray countries red. The Americans and Japanese want to turn the
gray countries blue." No one, in other words, is trying to preserve the
status quo. U.S. foreign policy elites might object to Akita's blunt
assessment and often dismiss the notion of "spheres of influence" as
outdated, Cold War--era thinking. But the U.S. goal is to replace the
old-fashioned competition for spheres of influence with a single liberal
sphere led by the United States. IN OR OUT? China, of course, does not
stand entirely outside the liberal international system. China has
become the world's second-largest economy in large part by embracing
some features of liberalism: it is now a top trading partner of many
countries, including, of course, the United States. And China has gained
greater influence in institutions such as the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank. The country both profits from
and---increasingly, by virtue of its wealth, talent, and
expertise---contributes to the liberal order. Yet in several key
respects, China remains outside that order. Its military modernization
and regional assertiveness challenge U.S. primacy in Asia and the
principle that countries should resolve territorial disputes through
peaceful adjudication. Although China has introduced significant
economic reforms, many observers question its support for liberal
economic development. Beijing argues that the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank, a Chinese-led international development bank, will
uphold good governance and environmental protection. Yet Beijing could
well renege on those promises. China is clearly an outsider in the realm
of human rights. The Chinese Communist Party maintains its grip on power
through the threat and use of force. It harasses, arrests, and tortures
political activists and suspected enemies, and it represses secessionist
groups, such as the Mongolians, the Tibetans, and the Uighurs. Under Xi,
the government has cracked down even more harshly on domestic dissent.
As a 2015 Human Rights Watch report put it, the Chinese leader has
"unleashed an extraordinary assault on basic human rights and their
defenders with a ferocity unseen in recent years"; in 2016, the
nongovernmental organization declared that "the trend for human rights .
. . continued in a decidedly negative direction." China also obstructs
its liberal partners' efforts to promote human rights across the globe.
In the 1990s, for example, China opposed UN intervention in Bosnia and
Kosovo, arguing that the West should respect national sovereignty. And
regarding Syria, China has vetoed multiple UN Security Council
resolutions calling for a political solution. For illiberal countries,
the inherently transformational nature of U.S. grand strategy appears
deeply threatening---something U.S. foreign policy elites too often fail
to recognize. NATO expansion, for example, provoked deep consternation
in Moscow. As the political scientist Joshua Itzkowitz Shifrinson has
noted, "Western scholars and policymakers should not be surprised that
contemporary Russian leaders resent the United States' post--Cold War
efforts and are willing to prevent further NATO expansion---by force, if
necessary." U.S. and European efforts to encourage Ukraine to join NATO
and the EU menaced Russia, and Russian President Vladimir Putin lashed
out. This is not to excuse Putin's military aggression; he had other
choices. But NATO members' inability to see how the expansion of their
alliance threatened Russia represented a serious failure of strategic
empathy. In East Asia, adding Vietnam to the list of U.S. regional
partners---or even allies---would seem to follow naturally from a
strategy of spreading democracy and free markets and might insulate a
liberalizing Vietnam from the coercive influence of its powerful
neighbor. But a U.S. alliance with Vietnam would represent a dramatic
departure from the status quo, and China would see it as such. U.S.
foreign policy analysts sometimes invoke the benefits of closer U.S.
relations with Hanoi without mentioning how threatening this development
would appear to Beijing, which could react in a similar way toward
Vietnam as Russia did toward Ukraine. U.S. policymakers should not
automatically defer to China and Russia. But to understand the real
tradeoffs of a given policy, they need to take into account how these
great powers will likely react. A BULL IN A CHINA SHOP? One can argue
that the United States' transformational strategy has had, and will
continue to have, a profoundly positive effect on the world. Or one can
argue that it is simply a manifestation of self-interested U.S.
expansionism. **[It's hard to argue, however, that U.S. policy has
sought to support the status quo. Proponents of the post--World War II
U.S. grand strategy might argue that there is no reason to adjust it
now. They might insist that challenges from China and Russia
demand,]{.underline}** if anything, **[a stronger U.S. commitment to
spreading liberalism]{.underline}**. **[According to this view, the
United States should strengthen its security commitments in eastern
Europe and extend new ones there. In Asia, the United States should
strengthen its existing alliances, align itself more closely with
Vietnam, and clarify its commitment to defend Taiwan.]{.underline}**
**[China, unlike the Soviet Union, does not have a revolutionary
ideology. By contrast]{.underline}**, **[realist critics might caution
that as the global balance of power changes, so must U.S. grand
strategy.]{.underline}** **[A transformational approach may have made
sense in the 1990s: it allowed the United States and its liberal
partners to gain ground when China and Russia posed little
threat.]{.underline}** Today, however, **[China's rise and Russia's
resurgence make this strategy]{.underline}** **[too
provocative]{.underline}**. In this view, **[Washington must be wary of
a growing risk of great-power conflict and, because all three countries
possess nuclear weapons, potentially catastrophic
escalation.]{.underline}**
