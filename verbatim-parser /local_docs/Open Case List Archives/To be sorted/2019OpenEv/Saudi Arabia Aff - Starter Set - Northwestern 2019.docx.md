#### US-arms sales to Saudi Arabia escalate Yemen conflict\-\--Causes US-Iran war

Nicholas **Kristof 19**, NYT foreign affairs correspondent, won two
Pulitzer's for covering Tiananmen Square, 5/18/19, "Is War Coming With
Iran? We're Already in One,"
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/18/opinion/sunday/war-yemen-iran-united-states.html

Is America headed for a war involving Iran?

Actually, we're already mired in one. It's the unconscionable [war in
Yemen]{.underline}, [where [we are complicit in]{.mark} the [deaths
of]{.mark} almost [a quarter million Yemenis]{.mark}]{.underline} so
far, many of them children who have starved to death.

Just a few days ago, bombs (perhaps American made) killed four Yemeni
children. Every 12 minutes, another child in Yemen dies.

Yemen is a complicated place with many bad actors, but [here's the
bottom line:]{.underline} [[Because of]{.mark} our [enmity toward Iran
and]{.mark} our [bond with Saudi Arabia]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[we are
helping]{.mark} to [starve and bomb]{.mark} Yemeni
[children]{.mark}]{.underline}.

With tensions in the region high, [[Saudi Arabia is]{.underline}]{.mark}
now [[encouraging the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[to escalate]{.mark} the [hostilities
and]{.mark} order a military [strike]{.mark} on
[Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}. "They must be hit hard," Arab News, a
newspaper with ties to the Saudi government, declared on Thursday.

Beware. That was the Saudi line as well in 2015 when Saudi Arabia's Mad
Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, intervened in Yemen. He wanted to show his
toughness and assumed that his armed forces would crush an Iran-backed
faction there called the Houthis.

Instead, [[the Saudi intervention resulted in Iran gaining influence in
Yemen]{.underline}]{.mark}, [while the Saudis have helped cause what the
U]{.underline}nited [N]{.underline}ations [calls the world's worst
humanitarian crisis]{.underline}. With talk of American conflict with
Iran again in the air, Yemen should be a reminder that wars are easy to
get into, harder to exit.

[It is Saudi Arabia]{.underline} and the United Arab Emirates [that drop
the bombs on Yemen]{.underline}, [but [Washington]{.mark} supplies
[weaponry]{.mark}]{.underline} and intelligence [that [allow]{.mark}
this [war to drag on indefinitely]{.mark}]{.underline}. American policy
is to support the starvation of Yemeni children because they are ruled
by a faction with ties to Iran.

This should not be a partisan issue. President Barack Obama backed the
Saudis in Yemen, and President Trump has doubled down on that support.

Most presidential candidates (with the exception of Senator Bernie
Sanders, who has been a strong opponent of the Yemen war) don't mention
Yemen much, and it receives little public attention. I'm writing about
it partly because I was able to slip through the Saudi blockade into
Yemen late last year, and I'm haunted by seeing my tax dollars go to
help starve children to death.

Congress passed a bipartisan measure to end U.S. involvement in the war,
but Trump vetoed it last month. A recent U.N. study calculated that if
the war ends this year, it will have claimed 233,000 lives, and that if
it continues until 2022, it will claim a total of 482,000 lives. If it
lasts until 2030, the U.N. estimated, it will cause 1.8 million deaths.

"Every day things get worse," Lise Grande, the U.N. humanitarian
coordinator in Yemen, told me this month. "There isn't anyone working
today in Yemen who doesn't believe that [the only solution to this
terrible, senseless crisis is to end the conflict]{.underline}. We have
to face the fact that [if fighting drags on]{.underline}, [[Yemen will
be a failed state]{.underline}]{.mark}, unstable for generations."

"Nearly every family has either lost someone, is hungry, has children
out of school or is battling cholera," Grande said. "It's hard to
understand why the lives of so many innocent people seem to mean so
little."

The Mad Prince's rash [interference in Yemen]{.underline} not only
backfired and [helped Iran]{.underline}, but a CNN investigation also
found that [it led [Saudi Arabia]{.mark} to [give American weapons
to]{.mark} fighters linked to [Al Qaeda]{.mark}]{.underline}. The chaos
led to the cholera outbreak, which worsened recently, with more than
300,000 suspected cases so far in 2019.

Iran and the Houthis have also behaved badly, but that's a poor excuse
for Americans to support war crimes against Yemeni children.

[Saudi Arabia]{.underline} and the United Arab Emirates [are no longer
enthusiastic about]{.underline} the [Yemen]{.underline} war,
[but]{.underline} they [don't want to leave and give Iran]{.underline}
and the Houthis [a victory]{.underline}. So [it's difficult to see how
the war ends unless the U.S. forces the issue.]{.underline}

Trump has said that if the United States doesn't sell weapons to Saudi
Arabia, then Russia or China will. But Saudi Arabia needs American spare
parts, and it also buys U.S. weapons partly for the implicit security
guarantee that comes with them. No other country can provide that
security blanket.

"[[The Saudi military is dependent on American]{.underline}]{.mark}
spare [parts]{.underline}, logistics [and
[munitions]{.mark}]{.underline}," noted Bruce Riedel, a Middle East
expert at the Brookings Institution. "[If Washington uses its enormous
leverage, the Saudis have no choice but to end the war]{.underline}."

[[We are drifting toward]{.underline}]{.mark} an [increased risk of a
[collision with Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [[the]{.mark} U.S.
[Navy]{.mark}]{.underline} in particular [[worries about an
accident]{.mark} in the Persian Gulf [that
escalates]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 1988, [in a similar period of
tensions, the United States mistakenly shot down an Iranian passenger
plane, killing 290 people on board.]{.underline}

#### That escalates\-\--causes [regional chaos]{.underline}, [terrorism]{.underline}, and [disrupts]{.underline} operations to [counter Russia and China]{.underline}

Ilan **Goldberg 19**, Director Of The Middle East Security Program At
The Center For A New American Security, 6/4/19, "What a War With Iran
Would Look Like,"
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iran/2019-06-04/what-war-iran-would-look

Moreover, [[even if the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [goes
into]{.mark} the [conflict hoping only to weaken Iran]{.mark}
militarily]{.underline}, [[it will]{.underline}]{.mark} soon [[face
calls]{.mark} at home and from Jerusalem, Riyadh, and Abu Dhabi [to
overthrow the]{.mark} Islamic [Republic]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a
result, [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [may stumble into]{.mark}
the kind of [regime change]{.mark}]{.underline} operation it carried out
in Iraq in 2003 and Libya in 2011---but this time on a much larger
scale. Iran today has a population of 80 million, more than three times
that of Iraq at the beginning of the Iraq war. The country's topography
is much more challenging than Iraq's. The cost of an invasion would over
time reach into the trillions of dollars. And [[consider]{.mark} for a
moment the [destabilizing effects of a refugee crisis stemming from a
country]{.mark} with a population [the size of Afghanistan, Iraq, and
Syria combined]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The United States might instead try to engineer the collapse of the
Islamic Republic without invading, as it tried in Iraq in the 1990s. But
unlike many Middle Eastern countries that have grown unstable in recent
years, Iran is not an artificial creation of European colonialism but a
millennia-old civilization whose nationalism runs deep. [Iranians are
not likely to respond to a major war with the United States by blaming
their own leadership and trying to overthrow it]{.underline}. Even if
they did, [the most likely result would be a transition from clerical
rule to a military dictatorship headed by the powerful Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps]{.underline}. In the worst case, [[internal
collapse would lead to civil war]{.underline}]{.mark}, just as it has
with several of Iran's neighbors, potentially [[creating terrorist safe
havens]{.mark} and enormous refugee flows.]{.underline}

Even short of such worst-case scenarios, any [[war with Iran would
tie]{.mark} down [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [in]{.mark} yet
another Middle Eastern [conflict for years]{.mark} to come]{.underline}.
[[The war]{.mark} and its aftermath [would]{.mark} likely [cost]{.mark}
hundreds of [billions]{.mark} of dollars [and]{.mark} hobble not just
Trump but future U.S. presidents. Such a commitment would mean the
[end]{.mark} of [the]{.mark} United States' purported [shift to
great-power competition with Russia and China]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Most likely, all parties understand these dangers---not least the
Iranian government, for which a war with the United States would be
particularly catastrophic. And for this reason, both sides will continue
to try to avoid an all-out war. [But sometimes even wars that nobody
wants still happen.]{.underline} The Trump administration and the
Islamic Republic should tread much more carefully, lest they send their
countries down [a dangerous and costly spiral]{.underline} that [will
quickly spin out of control]{.underline}.

#### Middle Eastern instability causes great power war

Migration, [[regional instability]{.underline}]{.mark}, and great-power
conflict. Civil wars are also [dangerous because they [could lead
to]{.mark}]{.underline} greater refugee flows, regional destabilization,
and [[great-power conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. Not [every civil war
has the potential for ]{.underline}**generating these global crises**[,
but if ]{.underline}**generated**, they would be a product not just of
civil strife but also of policy choices that were made by advanced
industrialized countries. In this regard, they should be contrasted with
possible pandemics and transnational terrorism that, arguably, would
occur regardless of the policies adopted by wealthy democratic states.
As Sarah Lischer\'s essay shows, the number of migrants--especially
people displaced by civil wars--has increased dramatically in recent
years.4 Most of these migrants have been generated by three conflicts,
those in Afghanistan, Syria, and Somalia. The wave of migrants entering
Western Europe has destabilized traditional politics and contributed to
the success of Brexit in the UK, the increased share of votes secured by
right-wing parties in a number of Western European countries, and the
electoral gains of a number of right-wing parties in Eastern Europe.
Anxiety about immigration contributed to Donald Trump\'s victory in the
United States. European countries, even those on the left like Sweden,
have responded to rising numbers of refugees by tightening the rules for
potential migrants. The European Union reached a deal with Turkey in
2016 to provide financial resources in exchange--among other things--for
an increase in acceptance of refugees. At the same time,
the sheer number of
refugees in Jordan andLebanon can potentially undermine government
control in those countries. The impact of [[civil
wars]{.underline}]{.mark} in one country can [spread]{.mark}
to surrounding areas. ISIL\'s ambitious campaigns have afflicted Syria
and Iraq. Civil strife in Somalia has, as Seyoum Mesfin and Abdeta
Beyene write, influenced the policies of Ethiopia.5 The FARC insurgency
in Colombia impacted Venezuela and Ecuador. Conflict in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) drew in several neighboring states. Some
regional conflicts have resulted in millions of deaths, most notably the
war in the DRC, with limited impact on and attention from wealthy
industrialized countries. [[Wars in the Middle
East]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, have been **more
consequential** because they have [[led to the
involvement of Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} and the United States, they
are closer to Europe and have therefore generated more refugees,
and [Middle Eastern oil is]{.mark} [a [global
commodity]{.underline}]{.mark} on which much of the world depends.
Regional destabilization in the Middle East does matter for the West;
regional destabilization in Central Africa may only matter for those who
live in the neighborhood. [[Direct
confrontation]{.underline} between [major
powers]{.underline}]{.mark} [[has not occurred
since]{.underline}]{.mark} the end of [[World War
II]{.underline}]{.mark}. In well-governed
areas, [where ]{.underline}**civil wars**[ are absent]{.underline},
the likelihood of great-power conflict is small. Territorial conquest
has been delegitimized (though Russia\'s annexation of Crimea stands as
a recent exception to this norm). The existence of nuclear weapons has
removed uncertainty about the costs of a confrontation between
nuclear-armed states with assured second-strike
capability. [Great-power confrontations are]{.mark}, however, [[more
likely in areas]{.mark} that are [afflicted by civil strife, because
instability and appeals]{.mark}]{.underline} from local actors [[could
draw in major]{.mark} state [actors with vested
interests]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is especially true for the Middle
East. Moreover, in countries on the periphery of Russia that were
formerly part of the Soviet Union, especially those with sizeable
Russian ethnic populations, the government in Moscow has demonstrated
that it can increase the level of internal unrest. There is no guarantee
of stability, even in countries that might have been stable absent
external support for dissident groups that would otherwise have remained
quiescent.

#### Terrorism causes extinction

Matthew **Bunn** **and Roth 18**, Nickolas, research associate with the
Project on Managing the Atom at Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center

practice and co-principal investigator with the Project on Managing the
Atom, 9/28/17, "The effects of a single terrorist nuclear bomb",
<https://thebulletin.org/2017/09/the-effects-of-a-single-terrorist-nuclear-bomb/>

And [what standards of international order and law would still
hold]{.underline} sway? [[The country attacked might]{.mark} well [lash
out militarily]{.mark}]{.underline} at whatever countries it thought
might bear a portion of responsibility. (A terrifying description of the
kinds of discussions that might occur appeared in Brian Jenkins' book,
Will Terrorists Go Nuclear?) [[With the nuclear threshold]{.mark}
already [crossed]{.mark}]{.underline} in this scenario---at least by
terrorists---[[it is conceivable]{.mark} that [some of]{.mark} the
resulting [conflicts might escalate to nuclear use]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[International politics could become]{.mark}]{.underline} more
[brutish]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [[violent,]{.underline} [with
powerful states taking unilateral action]{.underline}]{.mark}, [by
force]{.underline} if necessary, in an effort to ensure their security.
[[After 9/11, the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[led]{.mark} the [invasions of
two]{.mark} sovereign [nations]{.mark}]{.underline}, in wars that have
since cost hundreds of thousands of lives and trillions of dollars,
while plunging a region into chaos. [Would the reaction after a far more
devastating nuclear attack be any less?]{.underline}

In particular, the idea that each state can decide for itself how much
security to provide for nuclear weapons and their essential ingredients
would likely be seen as totally unacceptable following such an attack.
[Powerful states would likely demand]{.underline} that [others surrender
their nuclear material or accept foreign troops]{.underline} (or other
imposed security measures) to guard it.

[That could well be the first step toward a more profound transformation
of the international system]{.underline}. After such a catastrophe,
[[major powers may feel compelled to]{.mark} more freely [engage in
preventive war]{.mark}]{.underline}, seizing territories they worry
might otherwise be terrorist safe havens, and taking other steps they
see as brutal but necessary to preserve their security. For this reason,
[foreign policy analyst Stephen Krasner has argued]{.underline} that
["conventional [rules]{.mark} of sovereignty [would be abandoned
overnight]{.mark}."]{.underline} [[Confidence in]{.underline}]{.mark}
both the national security institutions of the country attacked and
[[international institutions]{.mark} such as]{.underline} the
[International Atomic Energy Agency and the U]{.underline}nited
[N]{.underline}ations, which had so manifestly failed to prevent the
devastation, [[might erode]{.underline}]{.mark}. The effect on nuclear
weapons policies is hard to predict: One can imagine new nuclear terror
driving a new push for nuclear disarmament, but one could also imagine
states feeling more certain than ever before that they needed nuclear
weapons.

#### US strategy shift is key to [deter adversaries]{.underline} and [assure allies]{.underline}\-\--avoiding Middle East conflagration is necessary 

Elbridge **Colby 19**, Director of the Defense Program at the Center for
a New American Security, 5/5/19, "HOW TO WIN AMERICA'S NEXT WAR,"
https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/05/05/how-to-win-americas-next-war-china-russia-military-infrastructure/

[[The]{.mark} U.S. [military will need to undergo dramatic
change]{.mark}]{.underline} [to prepare for possible attacks from China
or Russia]{.underline}. [For a generation, [the Pentagon operated
on]{.mark}]{.underline} what might be called [[the Desert Storm
model]{.underline}]{.mark}, under [[which]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[[exploited]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[enormous technical
advantages]{.underline}]{.mark} it had developed starting in the 1970s
to build a military capable of dominating any opponent in the 1990s and
2000s, a time when it lacked a peer competitor.

This approach was exemplified by the Persian Gulf War of 1990-1991.
After Iraq seized Kuwait late in the summer of 1990, the United States
first deployed forces to protect Saudi Arabia. Over the ensuing six
months, Washington assembled a broad coalition and built an iron
mountain of aircraft, tanks, warships, ammunition, and every other
expression of military might. Once the United States was good and ready,
it launched a withering air campaign that pummeled the Iraqi military
and quickly established total dominance of Kuwaiti and Iraqi airspace.
The subsequent ground invasion rapidly expelled the Iraqis from Kuwait,
after which the United States quickly ended the war on its preferred
terms.

The Gulf War operation was a stunning success---but the victory was owed
in great part to the fact that the nature of the conflict was perfectly
suited to the United States' advantages. Iraq had a formidable military,
but it was well behind that of the United States and incapable of
striking accurately beyond territory it owned or occupied. Meanwhile,
the desert provided an optimal environment for U.S. surveillance and
precision strikes, and Baghdad had no nuclear weapons to deter
Washington from launching such a pulverizing assault.

The world took note of the awesome power of the U.S. military. Until
today, no other country has dared to assault a U.S. ally. The point was
only magnified by the prowess the United States showed in its wars
against Serbia, the Taliban in Afghanistan, and Iraq in 2003.

[The problem today]{.underline}, however, [is [the approach]{.mark} that
worked so well against these]{.underline} so-called [rogue state
adversaries]{.underline} [[will fail against China or
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. That is because [[they]{.underline}]{.mark}
have spent the last 10 to 20 years specifically figuring out how to
undermine it. Victory, as the old saying goes, is never final, and it
breeds its own frustration. Today that takes the form of two militaries
that, while different, [[pose serious]{.mark} and intensifying [threats
to]{.mark} U.S. [allies]{.mark} and established partners in Eastern
Europe and the Western Pacific.]{.underline}

[[The core]{.underline}]{.mark} of both countries'
[[challenge]{.underline}]{.mark} [to the U.S. military [lies in]{.mark}
what are commonly called anti-access/area denial ([A2/AD]{.mark})
systems]{.underline}: in more colloquial terms, [a wide variety of
missiles, air defenses, and electronic capabilities that could destroy
or neutralize U.S. and allied bases, surface vessels, ground forces,
satellites, and key logistics nodes within their reach]{.underline}.
Both China and Russia have also developed rapidly deployable and
fearsomely armed conventional forces that can exploit the openings that
their A2/AD systems could create.

Despite these advances, both China and Russia still know that, for now,
they would be defeated if their attacks triggered a full response by the
United States. The key for them is to attack and fight in a way that
Washington restrains itself enough for them to secure their gains. This
means ensuring that the war is fought on limited terms such that the
United States will not see fit to bring to bear its full weight. Focused
attacks designed to pick off vulnerable members of Washington's alliance
network are the ideal offensive strategy in the nuclear age, in which no
one can countenance the consequences of total war.

The most pointed form of such a limited war strategy is the fait
accompli. Such an approach involves an attacker seizing territory before
the defender and its patron can react sufficiently and then making sure
that the counterattack needed to eject it would be so risky, costly, and
aggressive that the United States would balk at mounting it---not least
because its allies might see it as unjustified and refuse to support it.
Such a war plan, if skillfully carried out in the Baltics or Taiwan,
could checkmate the United States

[[To sustain]{.underline}]{.mark} what Mattis calls Washington's
constellation of [[alliances]{.underline}]{.mark} and partnerships, [the
U.S. [armed forces need to adapt]{.mark} [to deal with a]{.mark}
potential [great-power threat]{.mark}]{.underline}. This will require
making significant changes in the way the U.S. military is sized,
shaped, postured, employed, and developed---a change from a Desert Storm
model to one designed to defeat contemporary Chinese and Russian
theories of victory.

The U.S. military must shift from one that surges to battlefields well
after the enemy has moved to one that can delay, degrade, and ideally
deny an adversary's attempt to establish a fait accompli from the very
beginning of hostilities and then defeat its invasion. This will require
a military that, instead of methodically establishing overwhelming
dominance in an active theater before pushing the enemy back, can
immediately blunt the enemy's attacks and then defeat its strategy even
without such dominance.

In doing so, [the United States must demonstrate that its fight is
reasonable and proportionate, leaving the terrible burden of major
escalation on the opponent]{.underline}. Once their invasion has been
blunted and then stopped, Beijing or Moscow will be forced to choose
whether to escalate the war in ways that strengthen U.S. resolve and
bring others to its side---or settle for a real, albeit limited, defeat.

Since the end of the Cold War, the Pentagon's force planning
construct---the guidelines that determine how many and what kinds of
forces it needs---has focused on the ability to fight two simultaneous
wars against so-called rogue states. This standard has produced a force
emphasizing the deployment of large numbers of troops optimized for
beating the likes of Iraq, Iran, and North Korea---exactly the kind of
force to which China and Russia have adapted.

In the near term, then, [the Pentagon will need to make its existing
forces more lethal]{.underline}, for instance by equipping U.S. aircraft
and ships with more long-range missiles designed to sink enemy invasion
ships. In the longer term, the military will need to go further, using
artificial intelligence and autonomous systems in ways that can repel
intense attacks by a China exploiting the same technologies.

But [[the U.S.]{.mark} military, [even]{.mark} supplied [with the best
tech]{.mark}nology, [can't]{.mark} expect to [succeed]{.mark} against
major powers [unless it]{.mark} [rethinks its
posture]{.mark}]{.underline}. The model of the last generation was a
surge-based force that, when needed to eject an opponent from allied
territory, would gradually and securely flow from the United States to a
small number of fixed hub bases that were essentially immune to enemy
attack and then launch an overwhelming assault from there. Improvements
in military technology have now made these logistic tracks and bases
vulnerable to enemy attack at every step.

The new force needs to fight from the immediate outset of hostilities to
blunt the enemy's attack and, together with arriving follow-on forces,
deny the fait accompli. To make this strategy work will require a force
posture that is much more lethal, agile, and ready. To get there, the
U.S. military must make its bases and operating locations more
defensible and resilient as well as more geographically dispersed.

Nor can these efforts be confined to U.S. bases. The entire apparatus of
the U.S. military---including its logistics network and communications
systems---must shift from assuming invulnerability to expecting to be
under consistent attack or disruption while still performing
effectively. No longer can U.S. forces rely on exquisite systems
operating with little margin for failure.

Realizing these goals will also necessitate a new approach to the way
the armed forces are employed. [[The]{.mark} [N]{.mark}ational
[D]{.mark}efense [S]{.mark}trategy [provides an effective model]{.mark},
one that seeks to orient U.S. and allied forces toward denying China or
Russia the ability to rapidly seize territory and then harden its gains
in a fait accompli]{.underline}. The model calls, first, for small
contingents of U.S. forces to work closer toward potential front lines
alongside local partners in a so-called contact layer to build
relationships, deny adversaries the ability to manipulate information,
and set conditions for potential battle.

Second, a resilient and lethal blunt layer of U.S. and allied forces
should be present in or near vulnerable allies or partners to delay,
degrade, or deny enemy advances, thus frustrating the fait accompli.
Their task will be to buy time and space for surge layer reinforcements
coming from farther away that are trained to arrive, pick up their gear,
integrate with friendly forces already in the field, and get quickly to
the fight. Key forces that cannot quickly be deployed, such as air
defense units and armored vehicles, would be based close to the
potential fields of battle, while more flexible force elements---such as
infantry and tactical aircraft---would be trained to arrive and engage
the enemy before it can seal the fait accompli.

For [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to focus its military]{.mark}
on readying for great-power conflict, it [needs to use it]{.mark} far
[less for secondary missions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Over the last
generation and especially since 9/11, the operations tempo of the U.S.
military has risen markedly. Not only have U.S. forces been continuously
committed [[in the Middle East]{.underline}]{.mark}, Central Asia, and
Africa, but even many of those units that are not directly engaged in
those wars have been constantly participating in operations such as ship
cruises and exercises designed to deter adversaries and assure allies.
These factors have significantly eroded the force's readiness for a
high-end conflict. This must change. Beijing's or Moscow's calculations
of whether to attack or precipitate crises over Washington's allies are
going to be based on an assessment of how a war would likely
unfold---and especially whether their theory of victory would pan
out---not on the mere presence of U.S. ships. Moreover, assuring allies
is not an end in itself---deterrence of attack is the proper aim. Allies
should be sufficiently assured to prevent defeatism or buckling, but too
much reassurance encourages free riding, which Washington can no longer
afford to ignore.

As a result, much of the U.S. military is not as ready as it should be
to fight Russia over the Baltics or China over Taiwan. To rectify this
problem, Air Force and Navy pilots should spend more time at high-end
exercises and training schools and less time in air patrols over the
Middle East, and Army units should practice fighting Russians and spend
less time on counterinsurgency operations. Exercises with European
allies should focus more on honing their ability to defend NATO than
political symbolism.

The final piece of U.S. defense strategy that needs to change is the
relationship with allies and partners. Unlike in the post-Cold War era,
the United States needs its allies to help blunt Russian or Chinese
invasions but also respond to crises and manage secondary threats around
the world. U.S. forces are simply not large enough to do all this
themselves---and, given the necessity for the Pentagon to focus on
competing with Beijing and Moscow, the U.S. military's future focus must
be on quality rather than size.

Washington should encourage different allies to focus on different
roles, depending on their military situation and development level.
Front-line allies and partners such as Japan, Poland, Taiwan, and the
Baltic states should concentrate on their ability to blunt Chinese or
Russian attacks on their territory and to restrict Beijing's or Moscow's
ability to maneuver through adjoining airspace and waterways by building
their own A2/AD capabilities.

Higher-end allies farther from potential battlefields, such as Australia
and Germany, should work on contributing, both through their forces and
basing, to defeating Chinese or Russian aggression against nearby
allies. Partners such as France, Italy, and Spain with established
interests in places such as North Africa should allocate more forces to
handling secondary threats there.

The strategy outlined in this essay is an ambitious one. But it is
feasible at current spending levels---if the Pentagon and Congress make
the hard choices needed. A serious strategy in challenging times should
provide clarity on what is more important and what is less so and thus
what to do and buy and what not to. Strategies that promiscuously
enumerate threats, and call for equivalent vigilance between great
powers that can change the world and rogue states and terrorists that
cannot, will diffuse and squander Washington's scarce attention and
resources. Such strategies call to mind the remark about ordinary
critics, who, striving for balance, search for truth in the middle,
between the extremes of right and wrong. Certain threats are simply more
consequential than others and thus demand more attention.

[A clarity in priority means hard choices but does not mean ignoring
other threats to America's interests, including terrorists, North Korea,
and Iran. It does, however, mean right-sizing the U.S. approach to these
threats]{.underline}. The United States cannot afford to transform
recalcitrant Middle Eastern societies or pursue an eliminationist vision
of counterterrorism---but it does not need to. It needs to defend itself
from a North Korean nuclear attack and help South Korea defend itself
from invasion by Pyongyang. But it does not need to be able to invade
and occupy the North. The United States needs to relentlessly pursue
terrorists who can directly threaten it and its allies, but it does not
need to strike at every extremist with a taste for violence or remake
the societies in which they live. [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[needs to check Iran's aspirations]{.mark} for regional hegemony [but
not overthrow the Islamic Republic]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, the
United States does not need F-22s to attack terrorist havens nor whole
brigade combat teams to advise Middle Eastern militaries; cheaper drones
and tailored advise-and-assist units will do.

#### Adversary revisionism causes nuclear war

A. Wess **Mitchell 16**, President of the Center for European Policy
Analysis, 2/12/16, "Predators on the Frontier,"
https://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/02/12/predators-on-the-frontier/

[[Revisionist powers are on the move.]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[‎From]{.underline}]{.mark} eastern [[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} and
[[the Persian Gulf to the]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}outh [[C]{.underline}]{.mark}hina
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}ea, large [[rivals]{.mark} of the United States
[are modernizing]{.mark} their military [forces]{.mark}]{.underline},
grabbing strategic real estate, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[threatening]{.underline}]{.mark} vulnerable U.S.
[[allies]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Their goal is]{.mark} not just
[to]{.mark} assert hegemony over their neighborhoods but to [rearrange
the global security order]{.mark} as we have known it since the end of
the Second World War.]{.underline}

We first wrote about these emerging dynamics in 2010, and then in TAI in
2011. We argued three things. First, that revisionist powers were using
a strategy of "probing": a combination of assertive diplomacy and small
but bold military actions to test the outer reaches of American power
and in particular the resilience of frontier allies. Second, we argued
that the small, exposed allies who were the targets of these probes were
likely to respond by developing back-up options to U.S. security
guarantees, whether through military self-help or accommodation. And
third, we argued that that China and Russia were learning from one
another's probes in their respective regions, and that allies themselves
were drawing conclusions about U.S. deterrence in their own neighborhood
from how America handled similarly situated allies elsewhere.

Five years later, as we argue in a new book released this month, [these
dynamics have intensified dramatically]{.underline}. [[Revisionist
powers]{.mark} are indeed probing the United States]{.underline}, but
their methods [[have become]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[bolder]{.underline}]{.mark}, [more violent---and
successful.]{.underline} [[Allies]{.mark} have grown more alert to this
pressure, [amid]{.mark} the steady [whittling away of]{.mark}
neighboring [buffer zones]{.mark}, and [have begun to pursue]{.mark} an
array of [self-help]{.mark} schemes [ranging from arms build-ups to
flirtations with]{.mark} the nearby [revisionist
power.]{.mark}]{.underline} It has become harder for the United States
to isolate security crises to one region: [Russia's land-grabs in
Eastern Europe provide both a model and distraction effect for China to
accelerate its maritime claims in the South China Sea; Poland's quest
for U.S. strategic reassurance unnerves and spurs allies in the Persian
Gulf and Western Pacific]{.underline}.

By degrees, [[the world is entering the path to
war.]{.underline}]{.mark} Not since the 1980s have the conditions been
riper for a major international military crisis. [Not since the 1930s
has the world witnessed the emergence of multiple large, predatory
states determined to revise the global order to their
advantage]{.underline}---if necessary by force. At a minimum, [[the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates in coming years could face the pressure
of managing several deteriorating regional security
spirals]{.underline}; at a maximum, it [[could be confronted with a
Great Power war]{.mark} [against]{.mark}]{.underline} one, and possibly
two or even [[three, nuclear-armed]{.mark} peer
[competitors]{.mark}]{.underline}. In either case, the U.S. military
could face these scenarios [[without]{.mark} either the presumption of
[tech]{.mark}nological [overmatch]{.mark} or favorable force ratios that
it has enjoyed against its rivals for the past several
decades.]{.underline}

#### [Ending]{.underline} arms sales has a [unique signaling effect]{.underline}\-\--causes Saudi draw-down 

Jennifer **Spindel 19**, assistant professor of international security
at the University of Oklahoma, and the Associate Director of the Cyber
Governance and Policy Center, 5/14/19, "THE CASE FOR SUSPENDING AMERICAN
ARMS SALES TO SAUDI ARABIA,"
https://warontherocks.com/2019/05/the-case-for-suspending-american-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia/

[Arms embargos]{.underline} [are often dismissed as
symbolic]{.underline}, [and therefore ineffective]{.underline}. [But
just because something is symbolic, doesn't mean that it won't have an
effect. [A U.S. arms embargo against Saudi Arabia would be a clear
signal of]{.mark} American [disproval of]{.mark} Saudi [actions in
Yemen]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} [would be an equally
important signal to Washington's allies]{.underline}, who are [left
wondering if the United States is ambivalent or uninterested in the
growing Yemeni humanitarian catastrophe.]{.underline}

By continuing to provide weapons, President Donald Trump tacitly
endorses Saudi policies. This signal is strengthened by Trump's recent
veto of the resolution that called for an end to U.S. support for the
war in Yemen. While Trump justified the veto by saying that the
resolution was a "dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional
authorities," statements from Congressional representatives show they
are aware of the powerful signals sent by arms sales. Sen. Tim Kaine
said that the veto "shows the world \[Trump\] is determined to keep
aiding a Saudi-backed war that has killed thousands of civilians and
pushed millions more to the brink of starvation." [An arms embargo
against Saudi Arabia would be a signal both to leaders of that country,
and other states, that the United States does not endorse Saudi
actions]{.underline}. Those arguing against a ban are correct on one
point: Embargos as blunt force instruments of coercion are rarely
effective. But [[arms embargos]{.mark} are effective as signals of
political dissatisfaction, and [serve an important communication
role]{.mark} in international politics.]{.underline}

Arms Embargos Are Signals and Can Build Coalitions

Policymakers and scholars agree that arms embargoes are not effective
"sticks" in international politics. Rarely do states cave when faced
with punishment in the form of an embargo. But even if an arms embargo
isn't a direct tool of coercion, [an embargo would be an important
political signal]{.underline}. There are at least two reasons for the
United States to seriously consider an arms embargo against Saudi
Arabia.

[First]{.underline}, [[arms sales]{.mark} are signals that [cut through
the noise]{.mark} of the international system]{.underline}. [[Cutting
off]{.mark} arms [transfers is a common way that states express]{.mark}
their [dissatisfaction]{.mark} with others [and]{.mark} try to
[influence behavior]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Lawrence Freedman observed
in 1978, "refusing to sell arms is a major political act. It appears as
a calculated insult, reflecting on the stability, trust, and
credit-worthiness, or technical competence of the would-be recipient."
Yet this crucial point seems to have been lost in the current policy
debate about whether or not the United States should continue selling
arms to Saudi Arabia. [My research shows that stopping arms transfers or
denying requests is an effective way to signal dissatisfaction and
causes the would-be recipient to re-think their behavior.]{.underline}

Take, [[for example]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the U.S. relationship [with
Israel in the]{.mark} 19[60s]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The United States
sold Israel Hawk surface-to-surface missiles]{.underline} in 1962, [M-48
Patton tanks]{.underline} in 1964 and 1965, [and A-4E Skyhawk
bombers]{.underline} in 1966. [Israeli]{.underline} [leaders understood
that these transfers signaled a close U.S.-Israeli
relationship]{.underline}. As [diplomat]{.underline} [Abba
Eban]{.underline} [wrote]{.underline}, [the arms transfers were "a
development of tremendous political value."]{.underline} Even against
this backdrop of close ties and significant arms sales, [Israeli leaders
were extremely sensitive to arms transfer denials]{.underline}. [In
April and May 1967, the United States denied Israeli requests for
armored personnel carriers and fighter jets]{.underline}. Approving the
transfers would have signaled support, and likely emboldened Israel, as
tensions were growing in the region. [[Israeli leaders believed]{.mark}
these [transfer denials]{.mark} [overruled prior
signals]{.mark}]{.underline} and demonstrated that the United States was
not willing to be a close political ally for Israel. Eban described
Israel as "isolated," and the head of Israel's intelligence service said
that the arms transfer denials made it clear that "in Israel, there
existed certain misperceptions \[about the United States\]." [If arms
transfer denials could have such a significant effect on Israeli
thinking]{.underline} --- keeping in mind that there was a close and
significant political relationship between the US and Israel ---
[imagine what a transfer denial would mean for U.S.-Saudi
relations]{.underline}. Like Israel, [Saudi Arabia would have to
re-think its impression that it has political support and
approval]{.underline} [from the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. We can, and should, ask whether or not withdrawal
of U.S. support would affect Saudi behavior, but it's important that
this question not get overlooked in the current debate.

Because arms transfers (and denials) are powerful signals, they can have
an effect even before a transfer is actually completed. This suggests
that [[even the announcement of an embargo]{.mark} against Saudi Arabia
[could have an effect]{.mark}]{.underline}. Take, for example, Taiwan's
recent request for a fleet of new fighter jets. As reports mounted that
Trump had given "tacit approval" to a deal for F-16 jets, China's
protests increased. The United States has not sold advanced fighter jets
to Taiwan since 1992, partially out of fear of angering China, which
views Taiwan as a renegade province. Even if the deal for F-16s is
formally approved, Taiwan is unlikely to see the jets until at least
2021, and the balance of power between China and Taiwan would not
change. As one researcher observed, the sale would be a "huge shock" for
Beijing, "But it would be more of a political shock than a military
shock. It would be, 'Oh, the U.S. doesn't care how we feel.' It would be
more of a symbolic or emotional issue." Yet China's immediate, negative
reaction to even the announcement of a potential deal shows how powerful
arms transfer signals can be.

If this same logic is applied to an arms embargo against Saudi Arabia,
an arms embargo would signal that Saudi Arabia does not have the support
of the United States. [This signal would be an important first step in
[changing Saudi behavior]{.mark} because it would override other
statements and actions the United States has sent that indicate
support]{.underline}. And Trump has given Saudi Arabia a number of
positive signals: He called Saudi Arabia a "great ally" and dismissed
reports that that the Saudi government was involved in the murder of
journalist Jamal Khashoggi. He has expressed interested in selling
nuclear power plants and technology to Saudi Arabia. And he has
repeatedly claimed that he has made a \$110 billion arms deal with Saudi
Arabia (he hasn't). With these clear signals of support, why should
Saudi Arabia alter its behavior based on resolutions that come out of
the House or Senate, which are likely to be vetoed by Trump, anyway?
[[An]{.mark} arms [embargo would be a clear and unambiguous
signal]{.mark}]{.underline} [that the United States disproves of Saudi
actions in Yemen]{.underline}.

The second reason for supporting an embargo concerns U.S. allies and the
logistical difficulties of making an embargo have an effect. One of the
reasons embargoes have little material impact is because they require
cooperation among weapons exporting states. A ban on sales from one
country will have little effect if the target of the embargo can seek
arms elsewhere. Germany, instituted an arms ban against Riyadh in
November 2018, and German leaders have pressured other European states
to stop selling arms to the Saudis. Germany understands the importance
of the embargo as a political signal: as a representative of the German
Green Party explained, "The re-start of arms exports to Saudi Arabia
would be a fatal foreign policy signal and would contribute to the
continued destabilization of the Middle East." But the German embargo
has had minimal effect because Saudi Arabia can get arms elsewhere.

According to the 2019 Military Balance, most of Saudi Arabia's equipment
is American or French in origin, such as the M1A2 Abrams and AMX-30
tanks, Apache and Dauphin helicopters, and F-15C/D fighter jets. Saudi
Arabia has some equipment manufactured wholly or in part in Germany,
such as the Eurofighter Typhoon and the Tornado ground attack craft, but
these weapons are a small portion of its complete arsenal. [[A U.S.
embargo]{.mark} [would]{.mark} send an important [signal]{.mark} to the
[allies who also supply Saudi Arabia]{.mark}, allowing them to explain
participation in the embargo to their own domestic
constituencies]{.underline}. [This is especially important for countries
like France, Germany, and the United Kingdom]{.underline}, that need to
export arms to keep their own production lines running. While the
research shows that sustaining an arms embargo is often the most
difficult step, embargoes can restrain sending states' arms exports.
Even if a U.S. embargo won't have a direct effect on Saudi Arabia on its
own, [an embargo is important for [building coalitions for a more
expansive embargo]{.mark} that could affect Saudi behavior.]{.underline}

#### Causes a [political settlement]{.underline} in Yemen

Mohamad **Bazzi 18**, associate professor of journalism at New York
University and the former Middle East bureau chief at Newsday, 9/30/18,
"The United States Could End the War in Yemen If It Wanted To,"
https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/09/iran-yemen-saudi-arabia/571465/

[By accepting the coalition's cosmetic attempts to minimize civilian
casualties]{.underline}, [the [Trump]{.mark} administration [is]{.mark}
[signaling]{.mark}]{.underline} [to Saudi]{.underline} and Emirati
[leaders [its]{.mark} apparent [belief that a clear military victory in
Yemen remains possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [[as long as the
coalition believes it can crush]{.mark} the
[Houthis]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[there's little incentive]{.mark} for it
[to negotiate]{.mark}]{.underline}. Trump, then, has bought into Saudi
Arabia's zero-sum calculation: that a military win in Yemen for the
kingdom and its allies would be a defeat for Iran, while a negotiated
settlement with the Houthis would be a victory for Tehran. Blinded by
its obsession with Iran, [[the]{.mark} Trump [admin]{.mark}istration
[is]{.mark} [perpetuating]{.mark} an [unwinnable war and
undermining]{.mark} the [likelihood of]{.mark} a [political
settlement]{.mark}.]{.underline}

This current phase of the conflict in Yemen began in September 2014,
when the Houthis, a group of Shia rebels allied with Yemen's ousted
dictator Ali Abdullah Saleh, forced most of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour
Hadi's government to flee to Saudi Arabia, and threatened to take over
much of the country. In 2015, the Saudi-led coalition went to war in
Yemen to restore Hadi to power and roll back the Houthis. Since then,
[despite thousands of air strikes and an air and naval
blockade]{.underline} at a cost of some \$5 to \$6 billion a month for
Riyadh, [the Saudi-led alliance failed to dislodge the Houthis from the
capital]{.underline}, Sanaa.

While the Saudis are quick to blame Iran for the war, several
researchers, including Thomas Juneau, a professor at the University of
Ottawa and a former analyst at Canada's Department of National Defense,
have shown that the Houthis did not receive significant support from
Tehran before the Saudi intervention in 2015. [Iran has stepped up
military assistance to the Houthis since the war]{.underline}, and
Hezbollah has begun sending military advisers to train the Yemeni
rebels. But [the costs of this assistance fall far short of those
incurred by Saudi Arabia and its allies. For Iran, the Yemen conflict is
a low-cost way to bleed its regional rival.]{.underline}

The Saudis and Emiratis have largely ignored international criticism of
civilian deaths and appeals for a political settlement---and the Trump
administration's latest signal of support shows that strategy is
working. Investigations by the UN and other bodies have found both the
Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition responsible for potential war
crimes. But air strikes by the Saudis and their allies "have caused most
of the documented civilian casualties," the UN concluded in a report
last month. On August 9, the Saudi coalition bombed a school bus in the
northern town of Dahyan, killing 54 people, 44 of them children, and
wounding dozens, according to Yemeni health officials.

For weeks, the coalition defended the airstrike, but on September
1---with the deadline looming for the Trump administration to certify
Saudi and UAE efforts to reduce civilian casualties---the coalition
admitted that the bombing was a mistake and that it would "hold those
who committed mistakes" accountable. U.S. officials seized on that
statement as evidence that the Saudi coalition is willing to change its
behavior. But for three and a half years now, there has been "little
evidence of any attempt by parties to the conflict to minimize civilian
casualties," said Kamel Jendoubi, the chair of the UN investigation team
that documented war crimes

The [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [[has shown little
interest in using arms deals as leverage for a political
settlement]{.underline}]{.mark}, or to force the Saudis to take concerns
about civilian deaths more seriously. In March 2017, [Trump reversed a
decision]{.underline} [by]{.underline} the [Obama]{.underline}
administration [to suspend]{.underline} [the sale of]{.underline} more
than \$500 million in [laser-guided bombs]{.underline} and other
munitions [to the Saudi military]{.underline}. As more members of
Congress expressed criticism of Saudi actions in Yemen, the Senate
narrowly approved that sale. After the Houthis fired ballistic missiles
at several Saudi cities in late 2017, the Trump administration again
escalated U.S. involvement in the war. The New York Times broke the news
that the Pentagon had secretly dispatched U.S. special forces to the
Saudi-Yemen border to help the Saudi military locate and destroy Houthi
missile sites. Frustrated by the deepening U.S. role, two dozen members
of the House introduced a resolution this week invoking the 1973 War
Powers Act, arguing that Congress never authorized American support for
the Saudi coalition and instructing Trump to withdraw U.S. forces.

[[Saudi]{.underline}]{.mark} and Emirati [[leaders]{.underline}]{.mark}
want a clear-cut victory in their regional rivalry with Iran, and they
[[have been emboldened]{.underline}]{.mark} [by the Trump
administration's unconditional support [to stall
negotiations]{.mark}]{.underline}. [A]{.underline} recent [[UN]{.mark}
effort]{.underline} [to hold [peace talks]{.mark}]{.underline} between
the Houthis, Hadi's government, and the Saudi-led coalition
[[collapsed]{.underline}]{.mark} in early September, [[after]{.mark} the
Houthi delegation did not show up]{.underline} in Geneva. Houthi leaders
said [the [Saudis]{.mark}]{.underline}, [who control Yemen's
airspace]{.underline}, [[would not guarantee]{.mark} their [safe
travel]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Days later]{.underline}, [Yemeni forces
loyal to the Saudi-UAE alliance]{.underline} [launched a new
offensive]{.underline} aimed at forcing the Houthis out of Hodeidah
port, which is the major conduit for humanitarian aid in Yemen. UN
officials warn that a prolonged battle for the port and its surroundings
could lead to the death of 250,000 people, mainly from mass starvation.

After the Trump administration's endorsement this month, the Saudi-UAE
alliance has even less incentive to prevent civilian casualties and new
humanitarian disasters. [[Saudi Arabia and]{.mark} its [allies are more
likely to accept a peace process]{.mark}]{.underline} [[if it is clear
that the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[won't support an open-ended war]{.mark} in Yemen [and won't
provide]{.mark} the [military assistance]{.mark} required to keep the
war apparatus going]{.underline}. But Trump has shown little sign of
pressuring his Saudi and Emirati allies, least of all over Yemen. The
only realistic check left is in Congress, where more voices are asking
why the world's most powerful country is helping to perpetuate the
world's worst humanitarian crisis.

#### US action is [sufficient]{.underline}

Sophia **Lam 19**, journalist for the Gate, 4/9/19, "Ending US Arms
Sales to Saudi Arabia,"
<http://uchicagogate.com/articles/2019/4/9/ending-us-arms-sales-saudi-arabia/>

[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[continues to [play a preeminent role]{.mark}]{.underline} [in Saudi
weapons acquisitions]{.underline}. [[European
countries]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[reduced]{.mark} their arms
[sales]{.mark}]{.underline} [in response to Khashoggi's
death]{.underline} while [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
has [increased sales]{.underline}. There are multiple actors in the
international game but the US has the biggest muscles to flex,
economically and diplomatically speaking. [[Nearly all]{.underline} [of
Saudi Arabia's weapons have American parts]{.underline}]{.mark} or are
maintained by American technicians. [Saudi Arabia cannot find an easy
replacement]{.underline} for its US weapons imports: [[it would take
decades for Saudi Arabia to implement different]{.mark} [systems]{.mark}
and the [transition costs]{.mark} of such a switch [would be
monumental]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[By ending]{.mark} arms [sales]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[can assert
its sway]{.mark} over Saudi Arabia]{.underline}: if Saudi weapons and
systems are so reliant on US assistance, perhaps the Saudis should be
compelled to comply with new US terms; Such a move would help change the
narrative that the US will never use its military aid leverage over
other countries. If the United States suspended arms sales to Saudi
Arabia, other major arms exporters might either take similar measures or
continue to follow their own preexisting scalebacks.

[End Saudi Arms Sales]{.underline}

The United States' arms sales to Saudi Arabia are flawed in
humanitarian, economic and political terms. Rather than search for
innovative ways to justify protecting arms sales to Saudi Arabia, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates can and [should work
[to]{.mark} legitimately [foster]{.mark} sustainable [peace]{.mark} [and
stability]{.mark} in the Middle East]{.underline}. In short, the United
States ought to reverse its wrongs [by [ending]{.mark}]{.underline} its
[arms [sales]{.mark}]{.underline} [to Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. [Doing
so will not only allow war-torn Yemen to]{.underline} begin to
[recover]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} [[would]{.mark} also [allow the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} better revitalize its own economy, and
[[reassert its]{.mark} military [leverage]{.mark} and international
authority [to]{.mark} [hold]{.mark} allied [states]{.mark} like Saudi
Arabia [accountable]{.mark} for their agendas and actions]{.underline}.

#### Embargo Key\-\--Use restrictions are circumvented

Nima **Elbagir 19**, Sudanese journalist and an award-winning
international television correspondent, 2019, "Sold to an ally, lost to
an enemy,"
https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/02/middleeast/yemen-lost-us-arms/

Hodeidah, Yemen (CNN) -- [[Saudi Arabia]{.mark} and]{.underline} its
[coalition partners]{.underline} have [[transferred
American]{.mark}-made [weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to a]{.mark}l
[Q]{.mark}aeda-linked fighters]{.underline}, [hardline [Salafi
militias]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and other factions]{.mark} waging war
[in Yemen]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[in violation of their agreements with
the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}, [a CNN
investigation]{.underline} has [found]{.underline}.

[The [weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} have also [[made their way
into]{.mark} the [hands of Iranian-backed rebels]{.mark}]{.underline}
battling the coalition for control of the country, [exposing some of
America\'s sensitive military technology to Tehran and]{.underline}
potentially [endangering the lives of US troops in other conflict
zones.]{.underline}

[[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark} and the United Arab Emirates, its
main partner in the war, have [[used]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[US-manufactured]{.underline} [[weapons as a]{.underline}]{.mark} [form
of [currency]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to buy]{.mark} the
[loyalties]{.mark}]{.underline} [of militias or tribes]{.underline},
[bolster chosen armed actors]{.underline}, [and influence the complex
political landscape]{.underline}, [[according to]{.mark} local
[commanders on the ground]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and
analysts]{.underline}]{.mark} who spoke to CNN.

[By handing off this military equipment to third parties]{.underline},
[[the]{.mark} Saudi]{.underline}-led [[coalition is breaking the terms
of its]{.mark} arms [sales with the US]{.mark}]{.underline}, according
to the Department of Defense. After CNN presented its findings, a US
defense official confirmed there was an ongoing investigation into the
issue.

The revelations raise fresh questions about whether [[the US]{.mark} has
[lost control]{.mark} over a key ally presiding over one of the most
horrific wars of the past decade]{.underline}, and whether Saudi Arabia
is responsible enough to be allowed to continue buying the sophisticated
arms and fighting hardware. Previous CNN investigations established that
US-made weapons were used in a series of deadly Saudi coalition attacks
that killed dozens of civilians, many of them children.

The developments also come as Congress, outraged with Riyadh over the
murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year, considers whether to
force an end to the Trump administration\'s support for the Saudi
coalition, which relies on American weapons to conduct its war.

In 2015, Riyadh launched a coalition to oust Iranian-supported Houthi
rebels from the country\'s capital and reinstate the internationally
recognized government of President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi. The war split
the country in two, and with it came the weapons \-- not just guns, but
anti-tank missiles, armored vehicles, heat-seeking lasers and artillery
\-- all flooding into an unruly and complex state.

Since then, some of America\'s \"beautiful military equipment,\" as US
President Donald Trump once called it, has been passed on, sold, stolen
or abandoned in [[Yemen\'s state of chaos]{.underline}]{.mark}, where
murky alliances and fractured politics [[mean little hope for any system
of accountability or tracking]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Some terror groups have gained from the influx of US arms, with the
barrier of entry to advanced weaponry now lowered by the laws of supply
and demand. Militia leaders have had ample opportunity to obtain
military hardware in exchange for the manpower to fight the Houthi
militias. Arms dealers have flourished, with traders offering to buy or
sell anything, from a US-manufactured rifle to a tank, to the highest
bidder.

And Iran\'s proxies have captured American weapons they can exploit for
vulnerabilities or reverse-engineer for native production.

## War Power Advantage

#### [Advantage 2 is Congress]{.underline}: 

#### Congress' *War Powers Resolution* rebuke to Yemen involvement, vetoed by Trump, would have failed to challenge [Executive lawfare]{.underline}\-\--the plan builds a more [effective process]{.underline} checking Executive overreach 

Tess **Bridgeman 19**, Senior Fellow and Visiting Scholar at the Reiss
Center on Law and Security, NYU School of Law, 5/3/18, "Getting Past the
Veto on Ending Yemen War: How Congress' Next Moves Can Succeed,"
https://www.justsecurity.org/63855/getting-past-the-veto-on-ending-yemen-war-how-congress-next-move-can-succeed/

On Thursday, [[Congress failed to override]{.mark} President [Trump's
veto of]{.mark} bipartisan [legislation that]{.mark} had [directed him
to remove]{.mark} U.S. [armed forces from hostilities in Yemen]{.mark}'s
civil war]{.underline}. [[Congress has other paths it can]{.mark} now
[take]{.mark}, over the short and long term, to achieve the same
goals.]{.underline}

Passage of the now-vetoed joint resolution (S.J.Res.7) was, at a
minimum, a symbolic high-water mark in congressional reassertion of its
constitutional primacy in deciding when the United States should use
force abroad, at least compared to Congresses during the past three
administrations. Practically, however, use of the 1973 War Powers
Resolution (WPR) as a vehicle for ending a use of U.S. forces that
Congress disapproves of -- instead of using the power of the purse or
directly cutting off the specific types of support the Trump
administration is providing -- means that Trump's veto had little
impact. That's because the final version of the legislation provided the
Executive Branch a way to work around it. I explained why in this Just
Security article:

How could [[a bill under the WPR]{.underline}]{.mark} fail to constrain
U.S. involvement in Yemen's civil war? While important as a symbolic
rebuke, the bill [[directs the President to cease
activity]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[the]{.mark} Trump and Obama
[administrations]{.mark} both [argued]{.mark} has [never
occurred]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [the [involvement]{.mark} of U.S.
forces [in "hostilities" in Yemen]{.mark}'s civil war]{.underline}. As
Steve Pomper and I explained here, [[even if a WPR bill were
enacted]{.mark} over the President's veto, [the Admin]{.mark}istration
[would argue]{.mark} that [intelligence sharing and logistics
support]{.mark} to the Saudi-led coalition [do not constitute
involvement]{.mark} of U.S. forces [in "hostilities,"]{.mark} and thus
may lawfully continue]{.underline} (the same would apply to aerial
refueling, but the Trump administration stopped that activity of its own
accord late last year).

While Congress couldn't sustain the measure over Trump's veto --- the
Senate vote was 53 to 45, below the two thirds needed to override a veto
--- the story doesn't end here. [The process]{.underline} leading to the
passage of S.J. Res 7 and its inevitable veto [revealed the need for
Congress to start laying the groundwork for reform of the 1973 War
Powers Resolution]{.underline} -- a long-term endeavor that is
long-overdue. This will require sustained attention to where, how, why,
and at what cost the President is using U.S. armed forces abroad. [It
will]{.underline} also [require focusing on what mechanisms]{.underline}
[Congress can use most effectively to ensure it finds out about and can
limit (if it chooses) such activities.]{.underline}

But in the short term, the experience with S.J. Res 7 also provides a
roadmap for how Congress can fulfil its vital role in authorizing or
limiting military engagement that does not rise to the level of
"hostilities" as that term is interpreted by the Executive Branch.

[What Congress Can Do Next on Yemen]{.underline}

Trump's veto message revealed that he is committed to maintaining U.S.
military involvement in the disastrous war in Yemen in the face of
bipartisan opposition. It also showed he remains determined to defend
the Saudi government in the wake of its continued stone-walling about
the chilling murder of journalist and Virginia resident Jamal Khashoggi.
But the awareness-raising function served by debating and passing S.J.
Res 7 through Congress creates momentum in both Houses to craft
provisions that could end U.S. involvement in the Yemen war and move the
bilateral relationship with Saudi Arabia in a new direction.

There are a number of [[provisions]{.underline}]{.mark} -- some already
in existing bills -- that [[could]{.underline}]{.mark} swiftly [[become
part of a]{.underline}]{.mark} must-pass vehicle, like the National
Defense Authorization Act ([[NDAA]{.underline}]{.mark})
[[or]{.underline}]{.mark} an [[appropriations bill]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[that a]{.mark} [bipartisan majority]{.mark} of Congress [can get
behind]{.mark}]{.underline}. Having worked in the Obama White House, I
can attest how difficult it is for a President to veto the entire NDAA
despite provisions he finds loathsome. Of course, Congress too knows the
stakes of what makes it into the NDAA (or any must-pass legislation), so
it will be important to maintain bipartisan support for any
Yemen-related provisions among key committees of jurisdiction.

So, what are the kinds of legislative provisions that would be more
certain to achieve Congress's goal of cutting off U.S. support for the
Saudi-led operations in Yemen, while maintaining U.S. operations
directed against Al Qaeda and "associated forces"?

First, looking beyond the WPR, Congress can still achieve what S.J. Res.
7 was intended to do. As I noted here,

If the new [[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} is also serious about curbing
U.S. participation in Yemen's devastating civil war, it
[[should]{.underline}]{.mark} include a provision explicitly cutting off
specific forms of U.S. support --- not just directing withdrawal from
"hostilities" --- in a must-pass vehicle. Congress has a number of very
good options for doing so at its disposal. For example, two options,
which could be combined [[for maximum impact]{.underline}]{.mark}, are
(1) expressly prohibiting any further U.S. assistance or support,
including intelligence sharing and logistics support activities, to any
members of the Saudi-led coalition for the civil war in Yemen, and (2)
as Ryan Goodman has explained, [suspend]{.underline}ing [Direct
Commercial Sales licenses for]{.underline} maintenance and sustainment
of [fighter aircraft used in the Saudi coalition's offensive operations
in Yemen.]{.underline}

The first option would have the impact of ending the activities the U.S.
is actually undertaking in support of the Saudi-led coalition. The
second would create a strong incentive for the coalition to get serious
about negotiations to end the conflict: [it would have the impact of
grounding the coalition's fighter aircraft in short order, as they rely
on maintenance and spare parts provided under U.S.
licenses]{.underline}.

Congress could also choose to [[cut off arms sales to Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark}, which could be limited to certain
categories of weapons (i.e., potentially excluding weapons systems that
are defensive in nature) or sweep more broadly.

Second, existing provisions of the Saudi Arabia Accountability and Yemen
Act of 2019 use a range of tools to hold the Kingdom accountable for its
human rights abuses -- including the underlying problems that motivate
dissidents like Khashoggi to criticize the government in the first place
-- and for the Saudis' devastating restrictions on humanitarian access
in Yemen's civil war. While it is unlikely to make it out of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee soon, provisions in the bill such as
[prohibitions on certain arms sales to Saudi Arabia]{.underline},
prohibition of U.S. refueling of Saudi coalition aircraft engaged in
Yemen's civil war, and the imposition of sanctions for blocking
humanitarian access in Yemen, [could be included as amendments in the
NDAA or an appropriations bill.]{.underline}

Watch out for a Signing Statement

In his veto message on S.J. Res. 7, Trump wrote that if Congress seeks
to prohibit "in-flight refueling, or require military engagements adhere
to arbitrary timelines" it would be "interfer\[ing\] with the
President's constitutional authority as Commander in Chief of the Armed
Forces." And in a Statement of Administration Policy on the House
version of the War Powers Resolution bill, the President made the bolder
claim that Congress' cutting off U.S. support for the Yemen war "would
raise serious constitutional concerns to the extent it seeks to override
the President's determination as Commander in Chief." That is a bold and
dangerous claim.

[[If Congress does show]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[continued
resolve]{.underline}]{.mark} [by including provisions in the NDAA or an
appropriations bill]{.underline} [that cut off U.S. support for the
Saudi-led coalition]{.underline} in Yemen (or more broadly seek to hold
Saudi Arabia accountable for human rights and humanitarian abuses), we
should expect a signing statement by President Trump singling out those
provisions and making claims of constitutional interference like the
ones made in his Statements of Administration Policy on the Yemen War
Powers bills. Congress should be ready to challenge any interpretation
of the newly-enacted law that would suggest the President may simply
choose not to implement parts of a law on these highly dubious grounds.

One important insight that the Yemen War Powers Resolution bills have
demonstrated is that whatever the scope of the President's unilateral
constitutional authority to deploy troops and to initiate hostilities
might be, it is the legislative branch, not the President, that has the
last word -- if it is able to express its will in a statute passed
pursuant to its Article I authorities.

In sum, [[the clash]{.underline}]{.mark} between Congress' goals with
S.J. Res. 7 and the Executive Branch's interpretation of the War Powers
Resolution that S.J. Res. 7 brought into the spotlight [[can prompt a
broader process of reflection on how Congress can use]{.mark} its
[Article I powers more effectively]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [[and check
the Executive]{.mark}'s use of its Article II powers [more
consistently]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [in matters of war and
peace]{.underline}. That will be a long-term process. In the short term,
Congress can use President Trump's veto to galvanize support for
measures with real teeth that would begin to shift the U.S.-Saudi
relationship away from an unconditional embrace, cut off U.S.
involvement in Yemen's civil war, and show the Executive Branch that
Congress has the authority --- and the political will --- to do so.

[[A]{.mark} more [productive reform agenda]{.mark}]{.underline} (and by
no means a mutually exclusive one) [[would focus on strengthening
Congress's role in shaping]{.mark} U.S. [grand strategy more broadly.
Rather than devoting]{.mark} its [institutional energy to
reasserting]{.mark} its [control over decisions to engage]{.mark} the
enemy with military force [in particular circumstances, Congress would
work]{.mark} to [engage the executive]{.mark} branch more seriously and
[continually with regard to]{.mark} the general policy [circumstances
under which force might be contemplated. This]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[would require Congress to]{.underline}]{.mark} do something it is not
disposed to do, namely, [[use]{.underline}]{.mark} its other
powers---such as hearings, [[control of funds, and statutory
delegations]{.underline}]{.mark} of bounded policy discretion---[to
engage the executive branch on strategic questions about the way force
may be wielded [in advance of]{.mark}, or at the earliest stages of,
[crises.]{.mark}]{.underline} Proposals to restructure congressional
national security committees include the idea of creating more
consolidated, joint House-Senate national security committees, which
would have [[greater]{.underline}]{.mark} leverage, expertise, and
[[oversight responsibility]{.underline}]{.mark} and which [[would tie
together]{.underline}]{.mark} the elements of [U.S. [power more
effectively]{.mark}]{.underline}.218 These proposals should be viewed
not simply as means for Congress to consult with the Executive once
large-scale military intervention is imminent, but also as mechanisms
enabling Congress to coordinate with the Executive on the matching of
foreign policy means and ends well in advance of crises.

precarious]{.underline}. [New economic and geopolitical fault lines are
emerging]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The great powers of North and South America are barely on speaking
terms. [[Europe is]{.underline}]{.mark} again [[riven by geopolitical
antagonisms.]{.underline} [Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} should be a
prosperous, independent borderland between the European Union and
Russia. It [[has]{.underline}]{.mark} instead [[become a cockpit of
strategic contention]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and Russia have relapsed into
hostility]{.underline}. The post-Ottoman borders of West Asia and North
Africa are being erased. Neither Europeans, nor Russians, nor Americans
can now protect or direct their longstanding clients in the Middle East.
Brazil, China, and India are peacefully competing for the favor of
Africa. But, in the Indo-Pacific, [[China and Japan are at daggers
drawn]{.mark} and striving to ostracize each other]{.underline}.
[[Sino-American relations seem to be following]{.underline}]{.mark}
US-Russian relations [into mutual exasperation and
intransigence]{.underline}.

No one surveying this scene could disagree that the world would benefit
from recrafting the relationships between its great powers. As President
Xi Jinping has proposed, new types of relations might enable the great
powers to manage their interactions to the common advantage while
lowering the risk of armed conflict. [[This is]{.underline}]{.mark},
after all, [[the nuclear age]{.underline}. [A war could]{.underline}
[end in the annihilation of all]{.underline}]{.mark} [who take part in
it]{.underline}. Short of that, unbridled animosity and contention
between great powers and their allies and friends have high opportunity
costs and foster the tensions inherent in military posturing, arms
races, instability, and impoverishment.

behavior]{.mark}]{.underline}.[\[31\]](http://www.urich.edu/%7Eperspec/adler.htm#31)
[As a fundamental matter, emphasis on [joint policymaking]{.mark}
permits the airing of sundry political, social, and economic values and
concerns. Such a structure wisely [ensures]{.mark} that the ultimate
[policies will not]{.mark} merely [reflect]{.mark} the [private

the
President]{.underline}.[\[32\]](http://www.urich.edu/%7Eperspec/adler.htm#32)
{12} [Of course, this arrangement has come under fire in the postwar
period]{.underline} on a number of policy grounds. Some have argued, for
example, that fundamental political and technological changes in the
character of international relations and the position of the United
States in the world have rendered obsolete an eighteenth century
document designed for a peripheral, small state in the European system
of diplomatic relations. Moreover, [it has been asserted that quick
action and a single, authoritative voice are necessary to deal with an
increasingly complex, interdependent, and technologically linked world
capable of almost instantaneous massive destruction. Extollers of
presidential dominance also have contended that only the President has
the qualitative information, the expertise, and the capacity to act with
the necessary dispatch to conduct U.S. foreign]{.underline}
policy.[\[33\]](http://www.urich.edu/%7Eperspec/adler.htm#33) {13}
[These policy arguments have been reviewed, and discredited, elsewhere;
space limitations here permit only a brief
commentary]{.underline}.[\[34\]](http://www.urich.edu/%7Eperspec/adler.htm#34NAME=)
Above all else, [the implications of U.S. power]{.underline} and action
[in the twentieth century have brought about an even greater need for
institutional accountability and collective judgment than existed two
hundred years ago. The devastating, incomprehensible destruction of
[nuclear]{.mark} war and the]{.underline} possible
[[extermination]{.mark} of the human race [demonstrate]{.mark} the [need
for joint participation]{.mark} in any decision to initiate
war]{.underline}. Moreover, [[most]{.mark} of the [disputes]{.mark} at
stake between the executive and legislative branches in foreign affairs
[have virtually nothing to do with]{.mark} the need for [rapid
response]{.mark} to crisis.]{.underline} Rather, [they are concerned
only with routine policy formulation and execution]{.underline}, a
classic example of the authority exercised under the separation of
powers doctrine.[\[35\]](http://www.urich.edu/%7Eperspec/adler.htm#35)
{14} Nevertheless, these [joint functions have been fused by the
[executive]{.mark} branch and [have become]{.mark} increasingly
unilateral, secretive, insulated from public debate, and hence
[unaccountable]{.mark}]{.underline}.[\[36\]](http://www.urich.edu/%7Eperspec/adler.htm#36)
[In the wake of Vietnam, Watergate, and the Iran-contra scandal,
unilateral executive behavior has become ever more difficult to defend.
Scholarly appraisals have destroyed arguments about intrinsic executive
expertise and wisdom in foreign affairs and the alleged superiority of
information available to the
President]{.underline}.[\[37\]](http://www.urich.edu/%7Eperspec/adler.htm#37)
Moreover, [the inattentiveness of presidents to important details and
the effects of [\"groupthink\"]{.mark} that have dramatized and
[exacerbated]{.mark} the relative [inexperience of]{.mark} various
[presidents]{.mark} in international relations have also devalued the
extollers\' arguments]{.underline}. Finally, foreign policies, like
domestic policies, are reflections of values. Against the strength of
democratic principles, recent occupants of the White House have failed
to demonstrate the superiority of their values in comparison to those of
the American people and their representatives in Congress. {15} [The
assumption of foreign affairs powers by recent presidents represents a
fundamental alteration of the Constitution that is both imprudent and
dangerous]{.underline}. We turn now to an examination of the
judiciary\'s contribution to executive hegemony in foreign affairs.

Complicity,"
https://tcf.org/content/commentary/war-yemen-tragedy-america-can-end-complicity/?session=1

[[The problem of weapons sales transcends]{.mark} the [Yemen]{.mark}
War]{.underline} [and has contaminated a growing swathe of U.S.
policy]{.underline}. [[Weapons sales]{.mark} have [acquired a pernicious
logic]{.mark} of their own]{.underline}, [as if funding the U.S. weapons
industry were a jobs creation program and national security policy
simply a means to promote domestic economic growth]{.underline}. [U.S.
weapons [sales can be a major driver of conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}
and have routinely complicated foreign policy in regions where the
imperative to maintain market shares conflicts with core U.S. interests.
In specific cases like the Yemen War, where weapons sales run so
thoroughly against U.S. policy goals, they should end conclusively.

To date, [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has been]{.mark} almost
[entirely unwilling to give up any]{.mark} weapons
[contract]{.mark}]{.underline}, no matter how noxious, [[because of
the]{.mark} adverse impact to the U.S. [economy]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[This type of path dependency is counterproductive]{.underline}. The
United States must be willing to forego profitable contracts that harm
our interests or bind us to ineffective allies or specific misguided
policies.

[Winding Back the Forever War]{.underline}

[[The line between]{.mark} the [Yemen]{.mark} War [and America's global
war on terror is not]{.mark} a [long]{.mark} one]{.underline}. Congress
authorized the president to use military force against the perpetrators
of the September 11th attacks. Since then, [[military action has become
a reflex]{.underline}]{.mark} [rather than a rarity]{.underline}. U.S.
foreign policy since 2001 has been [[dominated by]{.underline}]{.mark}
direct and indirect [[intervention]{.underline}]{.mark}, [ranging from
outright invasion and occupation]{.underline}, as in Iraq in 2003, [to
dozens of undeclared and unmonitored actions that might not meet the
legal definition of direct military action]{.underline}. Trump's
excesses are an expansion of, rather than a departure from, the
practices of his predecessors. [[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} and
public opinion have [[tended to applaud]{.mark} military
[adventurism]{.mark}]{.underline} when they like its results
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[avoided confrontation with the
executive branch]{.underline}]{.mark} [even in cases where they
disapprove]{.underline}. Endless war has successfully been sold as a
public necessity in a campaign against terrorism, [[even when U.S.
military action makes the world]{.mark}, and Americans, [less
safe]{.mark}.]{.underline}

There are, of course, real security threats, and counter-terrorism
deservedly is a high priority for American officials---including in
Yemen. [[An effective counter-terrorism policy would move]{.mark} away
from a military paradigm [toward a policing
framework]{.mark}]{.underline}, in which the military supports a policy
that pursues terrorist networks much the same way that it pursues
organized crime syndicates. [[As the practice stands]{.mark}, the
forever war it has produced and perpetuates has corroded American values
and behavior]{.underline}. [[Malpractice]{.mark} abroad has [bred
contempt for]{.mark} our [democratic values and]{.mark}]{.underline} a
hopelessness about [[the rule of law]{.underline}]{.mark} at home.
Ideological frameworks used to justify foreign intervention and
mistreatment of civilians in conflict zones have also been invoked at
home. Threat inflation and demagoguery have helped fuel bigotry and
xenophobia at home. Elected officials now risk their careers if they try
to openly address the tradeoff between security and rights.

[[Ending the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates' [part in the Yemen
campaign]{.mark}]{.underline} won't suddenly bring an end to the
American forever war. But it [[would mark a turning
point]{.underline}]{.mark}---[a decisive rejection of the reflex to sign
onto any military conflict with even the slightest connection to
terrorism]{.underline}. The United States has a great many tools at its
disposal beyond weapons sales and direct engagement in hostilities. We
can pursue our interests in Yemen while avoiding extremes; and American
self-interest does not require it to fully reject its traditional allies
in the Gulf nor to actively join them in their worst excesses. [[A
rational assessment of]{.mark} that [self-interest might]{.mark} [now be
possible]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Trump's Dangerous Approach to Arms Sales,"
https://www.armscontrol.org/issue-briefs/2019-01/congress-exert-responsible-oversight-trumps-dangerous-approach-arms-sales

In general, [[transparency around arms deliveries remains too
obscure]{.underline}]{.mark} as a [New Hampshire NPR
reporter]{.underline} [recently discovered]{.underline}. [When U.S.
census [export data]{.mark} showed weapons worth more than \$61 million
had been sold from his state to Saudi Arabia in August
2018]{.underline}, [he [could not uncover what was in]{.mark} the [sales
nor which]{.mark} [companies provided]{.mark} the
[weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline} Annual reports on U.S. arms transfers
have grown increasingly opaque. Congress should mandate a change
demanding much greater transparency on the specifics of what is in U.S.
weapons deliveries.

Finally, sometime in the first quarter of 2019, the administration is
expected to publish final rules transferring export authority on select
firearms from the State Department to the Commerce Department, despite a
large number of negative public comments and a great deal of concern.
Members of Congress have raised an alarm that they will lose
notifications about these sales, which in the past two years has enabled
them to forestall small arms sales to Turkey and the Philippines. Last
year, legislation was introduced to stop these changes and should again
be considered. As with [[Trump's broad approach to arms
sales]{.underline}]{.mark}, these changes [[risk making it easier for
weapons to end up in the hands of terrorists]{.mark}, [international
criminals]{.mark}, [and abusive regimes]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Just before the December 2018 vote on direct U.S. military engagement in
the war, Sen. Menendez expressed concern [that [the]{.mark} Trump
[admin]{.mark}istration [believed "selling weapons to]{.mark} the
[Saudis was more important than]{.mark} [America's]{.mark} enduring
[commitment to]{.mark} human rights, [democratic values]{.mark}, and
international norms]{.underline}." [[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} has
the tools and [[must now use its authority to ensure]{.mark} U.S. [arms
sales strengthen]{.mark}, [rather than undermine]{.mark}, those
[enduring]{.mark} values and [norms]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The Soviet Union was an existential threat, and this focused the
attention of the world, and the American people. There existential
threat today is not found on a map, but it is very
real. [The [forces]{.mark} of the past [are]{.mark}
[making]{.mark} steady [progress against the modern world
order]{.mark}. [Terrorist movements]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Middle
East, [[extremist parties]{.underline}]{.mark} across Europe, a paranoid
tyrant in [[North Korea]{.underline}]{.mark} **threatening nuclear
blackmail**, and, at the center of the web, an aggressive KGB dictator
in [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. They all want to **turn the world back
to a dark past** [because their survival is threatened by the values of
the free world]{.underline}**,** epitomized by the United States. [And
they [are thriving as the U.S.]{.mark} has
[retreated]{.mark}]{.underline}.The global freedom index has declined
for ten consecutive years. No one like to talk about the United States
as a global policeman, but this is what happens when there is no cop on
the beat. American leadership **begins at home**, right here. [[America
cannot lead]{.underline}]{.mark} the world [[on democracy and human
rights if there is no unity]{.mark} on the meaning and [importance of
these things]{.mark}]{.underline}. Leadership is required to make that
case clearly and powerfully. Right now, Americans are engaged in
politics at a level not seen in decades. It is an opportunity for them
to rediscover that making America great begins with believing America
can be great. The Cold War was won on American values that were shared
by both parties and nearly every American. Institutions that were
created by a Democrat, Truman, were triumphant forty years later thanks
to the courage of a Republican, Reagan. This [[bipartisan
consistency]{.underline}]{.mark} [[created]{.underline}]{.mark} the
decades of [[strategic stability]{.mark} that is the great strength of
democracies. [Strong institutions]{.mark}]{.underline} that outlast
politicians [[allow]{.mark} for [long-range
planning]{.mark}]{.underline}. In contrast, dictators can operate only
tactically, not strategically, because they are not constrained by the
balance of powers, but cannot afford to think beyond their own
survival. This is why a dictator like Putin has an advantage in chaos,
the ability to move quickly. This can only be met by strategy, by
long-term goals that are based on shared values, not on polls and cable
news. The fear of making things worse has paralyzed the United States
from trying to make things better. There will always be setbacks, but
the United States cannot quit. The spread of [[democracy is the only
proven remedy for]{.mark} nearly [every crisis that plagues the world
today. War]{.mark}, famine, poverty,
terrorism--all [are]{.mark} generated and [exacerbated by authoritarian
regimes]{.mark}]{.underline}. A policy of America First inevitably puts
American security last.American leadership is required because there is
no one else, and because it is good for America. [[There is no
weapon]{.mark} or wall that is [more]{.mark} [powerful]{.mark} for
security [than America being]{.mark} envied, imitated, and
[admired]{.mark} around the world]{.underline}. Admired not for being
perfect, but for having the exceptional courage to always try to be
better. Thank you

Punish Saudi Arabia? Cut Off Its Weapons Supply,"
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/12/opinion/saudi-arabia-arms-sales.html

To date these sales have not "stewarded our national security." Beyond
its tragic war in Yemen, Saudi Arabia has blockaded Qatar, an ally that
hosts the Middle East's largest American military base. And Saudi Arabia
provides little help when it comes to Washington's real regional
priorities, such as fighting the Islamic State and stabilizing Iraq. The
Pentagon's National Defense Strategy specifically de-emphasizes the war
on terror to focus on competition with China and Russia.

[This]{.mark}, however, [is unlikely even in the long
term]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Saudi Arabia is in the middle of a]{.mark} major
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}, and more than 60 percent of its arms
deliveries over the past five years came from the United States. [The
Saudi military relies not just on American tanks, planes and missiles
but for a daily supply of maintenance, training and support, such as
intelligence and refueling]{.underline}. In the longer term, [almost all
of Saudi Arabia's remaining exports come from Europe]{.underline}.
[[To]{.mark} truly [squeeze Saudi Arabia]{.mark}, [a coordinated
embargo]{.mark}]{.underline} --- much like the one now in place against
Russia --- [[would be]{.mark} necessary but relatively [easy]{.mark}.
European governments already feel strong domestic political pressure not
to export to regimes like Saudi Arabia.]{.underline}

[[Transforming the Saudi military to employ Russian]{.mark}, [much less
Chinese]{.mark}, [weapons would cost a fortune]{.mark} even by Gulf
standards]{.underline}, would [[require years of
retraining]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and]{.mark} would [greatly
reduce]{.mark} its [military power for a
generation]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Russia cannot produce

#### Saudi's won't switch\-\--plan creates an [effective alliance]{.underline}

Doug **Bandow 18**, senior fellow at the Cato Institute, 11/26/18,
"Saudi Arabia Does More Harm than Good,"
https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/saudi-arabia-does-more-harm-good

Still, Riyadh is going to continue purchasing American weapons for its
own reasons. It could diversify suppliers, but for logistical reasons
the kingdom has reason to continue its relationship with the Pentagon.

If nothing else the royal regime needs spare parts and training to
maintain its forces. That need will only grow if Riyadh can no longer
count on America to protect it from its own folly.

Commercial sales beyond weapons are even less important to America's
\$20 trillion economy. If MbS is serious about reforming his nation's
energy-dependent economy, he is going to deal with American companies.
Anyway, a presidential desire that the Saudis buy products as well as
lobbyists and think tanks is not a good reason to insulate a murderous,
irresponsible and reckless regime.

The administration should stop acting like it is beholden to MbS. The
U.S. should end all support for the Yemen war. Weapons sales should be
placed on hold.

This doesn't mean the administration need treat Saudi Arabia as an enemy
and refuse to deal with MbS. After all, American presidents engaged
Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong and Kim Jong-un.

In dealing with ugly, brutal and authoritarian regimes the president's
transactional approach makes some foreign policy sense. However, there
should be no exaggerated expressions of fervent friendship, no illusions
about shared values, and no attempt to sugarcoat Riyadh's sustained
assault on human rights and American interests.

In particular, the U.S. should indicate that while Washington recognizes
the Saudis will choose their own leadership, the U.S. will be forced to
look to its own interests. That means confronting MbS' irresponsible
actions and aggressive reach for hegemony, which are destabilizing the
region.

The kingdom is not a U.S. or Western ally in any real sense. Working
together when appropriate should never be confused with endorsing or
even accepting such a malodorous regime.

### AT China Fill-In

#### China [can't]{.underline} and [won't]{.underline}

Sarah **Zheng 18**, Journalist for the South China Morning Post,
10/17/18, "China may seek to boost ties with Saudi Arabia but it 'can't
fill US arms sales gap'"
https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/2168849/china-may-seek-boost-ties-saudi-arabia-it-cant-fill-us-arms

[[China]{.mark} may continue to engage more with Saudi Arabia if
Washington imposes sanctions over the disappearance]{.underline} and
presumed murder [of]{.underline} Saudi journalist Jamal
[Khashoggi]{.underline}, [but it [cannot supplant US arms sales]{.mark}
as President Donald Trump believes, analysts say.]{.underline}

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday as
Washington weighs actions against Riyadh over the fate of Khashoggi, a
US resident and vocal critic of the Saudi regime who vanished two weeks
ago. But Trump has been reluctant to support sanctions, citing the
impact to a US\$110 billion arms deal he helped broker last year.

"I don't like the concept of stopping an investment of US\$110 billion
into the United States because you know what they're going to do?" Trump
told reporters last week. "They're going to take that money and spend it
in Russia or China or someplace else."

[[Saudi Arabia]{.mark} has [long sought to diversify]{.mark} away
[from]{.mark} its [reliance on the US]{.mark}]{.underline} [and has
increasingly stepped up its engagement with China]{.underline}, its
largest trading partner with US\$42.36 billion in bilateral trade in
2017. Last March, the two countries also signed US\$65 billion worth of
deals in areas ranging from energy to space technology.

The Arab nation could turn to countries such as China and Russia to help
fulfil its military needs if US sanctions were imposed, a step that
would "create an economic disaster that would rock the entire world",
according to a widely cited opinion piece by the general manager of the
Saudi-owned Al Arabiya news channel.

In the editorial, Turki Aldakhil said Saudi Arabia -- the world's
largest oil exporter -- was considering more than 30 countermeasures to
be taken against the US, including trading oil in yuan instead of the US
dollar.

[[But]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the military realm]{.underline},
[[China's arms exports to Saudi Arabia lag far behind]{.mark} those of
the US and its European allies]{.underline}. Beijing exported only
around US\$20 million in arms last year compared to US\$3.4 billion from
Washington, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute, a Swedish think tank.

Jonathan Fulton, assistant professor of political science at Zayed
University in Abu Dhabi, said China had grown more serious in its
regional arms relationships with Gulf states in recent years, with the
potential to serve as a "wedge" as US-Saudi relations frayed. Along with
Riyadh's previous indications that it was willing to consider funding in
yuan, increased arms sales would be a "natural progression" of their
relationship, he said.

"Part of the reason why \[Saudi Arabia\] is diversifying is there's been
so many kinds of structural changes in the relationship with the US,"
Fulton said. "Another important part is just obviously the commercial
relationship and economic relationship between these Gulf states and
China, with these energy exports. We're seeing a lot more engagement
both ways."

But as evidence piles up that Saudi Arabia ordered Khashoggi's
assassination, which the government denies, the backlash is getting
louder. A bipartisan group of US senators have pressured Trump to enact
sanctions and key corporate sponsors have pulled out of the high-profile
"Davos in the Desert" investment forum to be held in Riyadh this month.

"I would expect to see some kind of ... Saudi-led way to ease the
tensions between the US and Riyadh because I don't think they can afford
to let the US relationship deteriorate," Fulton said.

Simone van Nieuwenhuizen, an Australia-based researcher of China-Middle
East relations at the University of Technology Sydney, said China would
be "extremely unlikely" to follow US sanctions if they were levelled
against Saudi Arabia, but may not necessarily increase trade with the
country either.

"I think China is likely to keep a low profile on this issue and see how
it plays out before directly addressing it," she said. "While its
technology is developing, [[China]{.mark} still [lags behind the US
in]{.mark} the [sophistication and capability of]{.mark} its [military
equipment]{.mark}. [It]{.mark} simply [can't fill the
gap]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Robert Mason, director of the Middle East Studies Centre at the American
University in Cairo, said [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} [[would not want
to get involved]{.underline}]{.mark} [at this stage [to avoid]{.mark}
further [tensions with]{.mark} the [Trump]{.mark}
administration.]{.underline}

[[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, has in the process upped
the percentage of its purchases from Europe and the United States to 98
percent of its overall [[arms imports]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is a
significant [[dependency]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[would
be]{.underline}]{.mark} very hard, if not
[[impossible]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[to break]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Saudi Arabia's [attempts to diversify]{.mark} its [sources]{.mark} of
weaponry [has thus far been unsuccessful]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[This dependency goes]{.mark} beyond mere dollar figures and
percentages [to]{.mark} the [difficulty of changing]{.mark} weapon
[systems]{.mark}, [personnel training]{.mark}, [and war
strategies]{.mark}]{.underline}. Here the dependency is total because
while European weapons can easily be made interoperable with US weapons,
[this is not the case [with weapons purchased from Russia and
China]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The [Saudis would need]{.mark} [an entirely
different approach]{.mark} and training for their military
forces]{.underline}.

Bruce Riedel, the author of Kings and Presidents, a book that narrates
the story of Saudi dependency on the United States, says that of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, Saudi Arabia would have the
most difficulty in switching over to a different system of security and
weaponry.

Yet such [warnings of the Iranian threat miss a key factor]{.underline}:

### Arms Sales Bad\-\--Studies\-\--2AC

#### US arms sales escalate without deterring\-\--[academic consensus]{.underline}

Trevor **Thrall 18**, senior fellow for the Cato's Institute's Defense
and Foreign Policy Department, 7/2/18, "Arms Sales: Pouring Gas on the
Fires of Conflict,"
https://www.cato.org/blog/arms-sales-pouring-gas-fires-conflict

Do arms sales cause war? Or do wars cause arms sales? Critics of arms
sales often argue that [[selling weapons]{.mark} abroad]{.underline}
[[fuels conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. And indeed, one can point to one
or more sides using American weapons [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} many
recent conflicts including Syria, [[Yemen]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
Iraq. [Skeptics argue]{.underline}, on the other hand, [that weapons
don't start the fire and that conflicts would arise whether or arms
exporters like the United States sell weapons abroad.]{.underline}

The debate has important implications for foreign policy. If selling or
transferring weapons abroad makes conflict more likely, or intensifies
conflicts already in process, then the United States should rethink its
long-held policy of selling weapons to pretty much any nation that wants
them. If, on the other hand, arms sales have no impact on conflict or
make conflict less likely, then the Trump administration's intention of
expanding arms sales should be seen as a positive move.

As it turns out, [[several academic studies]{.underline}]{.mark} [have
[looked at this]{.mark} question]{.underline}. [[The primary
conclusion]{.underline}]{.mark} of these works [[is
that]{.underline}]{.mark} [although [arms sales]{.mark} do not create
conflicts out of thin air]{.underline}, [they do [make conflict more
likely when]{.mark} the [conditions]{.mark} for conflict [are]{.mark}
already [present]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The basic logic behind this conclusion is fairly straightforward and has
been noted in the academic literature for some time. In a 1998 article,
"Arms Transfer Dependence and Foreign Policy Conflict," David Kinsella
argues that [[states]{.mark} that enjoy a steady flow of
arms]{.underline} -- especially from multiple countries -- [[tend to
pursue more aggressive foreign policies]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
increase in the recipient's military capability makes victory in a
potential conflict more likely, [[which]{.mark} in turn [raises]{.mark}
the [likelihood]{.mark} that [the state will]{.mark} start disputes,
demand concessions from its neighbors in those disputes, and to
[escalate]{.mark} to [conflict]{.mark} if negotiations fail]{.underline}
to produce the desired outcome. [Using [case studies
from]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Israel]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[Egypt]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[Syria]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}, [Iraq]{.underline}, [India]{.underline},
[[Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark}, [Ethiopia]{.underline}, [[and
Somalia]{.underline}]{.mark} [Kinsella [find]{.mark}]{.underline}s
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark}, when a country has more than one weapons
supplier, [arms [sales drastically]{.mark} [increase]{.mark} the
[chances of conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In their 2002 article, "The Arms Trade and the Incidence of Political
Violence in Sub-Saharan Africa, 1967-97," Cassady Craft and Joseph
Smaldone identify another mechanism by which arms sales can fuel
conflict. They find that autocratic governments importing weapons are
more likely to use those weapons to oppress/mistreat/kill their own
citizens since they now have a greater coercive capability.

But despite the straightforward logic behind the arms sales/conflict
connection, most work on the topic to date has relied on case studies,
which are wonderful for highlighting potential causal mechanisms but not
much use for establishing whether those mechanisms hold across the time
and space. [[Until recently]{.underline} [there had not
been]{.underline}]{.mark} [any [work using statistical
methods]{.mark}]{.underline} [[that]{.mark} would [allow scholars to
state with confidence]{.mark} which direction [the causal
mechanism]{.mark} actually flows]{.underline} -- that is, do arms sales
precede conflict or do impending conflicts lead to increased arms sales?
Happily, [[the]{.mark} most [recent article]{.mark} on arms sales
[by]{.mark} Oliver [Pamp]{.mark}]{.underline} and his colleagues in the
January 2018 issue of the Journal of Peace Research entitled, "The
Build-Up of Coercive Capacities: Arms Imports and the Outbreak of
Violent Intrastate Conflict," [[uses a simultaneous equations model
to]{.mark} overcome this problem]{.underline}. Looking at the
relationship between arms sales and the outbreak of civil conflicts,
[the authors [confirm]{.mark}]{.underline} the general thrust of
[[previous research, concluding that]{.underline}]{.mark}:

"...while [[arms imports]{.underline}]{.mark} are not a genuine cause of
intrastate conflicts, they [significantly increase]{.underline} [the
probability of an onset in countries where conditions are notoriously
conducive to conflict]{.underline}. In such situations, [arms
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} [[not an effective deterrent]{.underline}
[but]{.underline}]{.mark} [rather [spark]{.mark} conflict
[escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}."

[This new confidence in the arms sales/conflict connection should compel
serious revision to American arms sales policies]{.underline}. Since
2002 the United States has sold over \$286 billion dollars of weapons to
167 countries. These exports have gone to numerous countries where the
conditions were or remain ripe for conflict. U.S. arms transfers to an
unstable Iraq preceded the emergence of the Islamic State, but wound up
helping amplify the Islamic State's military capability when it took
vast quantities of American weapons from defeated Iraqi army units.
[[U.S. arms sales]{.underline}]{.mark} over the past decade also
[[helped]{.underline}]{.mark} prepare [[Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[launch its]{.mark} disastrous
[intervention in Yemen]{.mark}]{.underline} and enabled the Nigerian
government to unleash more effective violence on its own citizens, just
to list a few examples.

Academic research often gets a bad rap in policy making circles. In the
case of arms sales and arms transfers, however, the scholarly literature
has correctly pointed out the serious risks involved. [If
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is serious
about preventing conflict and managing regional stability in trouble
spots around the globe, it would do well to stop pouring gas on the
fire]{.underline}.

[[Advocates]{.mark} of arms exports]{.underline} have [long
[argued]{.mark}]{.underline} that such [[sales are]{.mark} critical for
[promoting regional stability]{.mark}]{.underline} [in trouble spots

the Middle East are doing the exact opposite]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Arms
export [data from the]{.mark} [Stockholm International Peace Research

sales]{.mark} to the Middle East [has steadily]{.mark}
[increased]{.mark} over the past 15 years]{.underline}, [yet [with
conflicts in]{.mark}]{.underline} Syria, [[Yemen]{.underline}]{.mark},
and throughout North Africa, [[the region is as unstable as

United Arab Emirates have already enabled those nations to carry out a
bloody and catastrophic war in Yemen, which has killed thousands of
civilians, displaced most of the population, and put millions more at
risk of starvation and disease. [[By continuing to sell]{.mark} weapons
[to Saudi]{.mark} [Arabia]{.mark}]{.underline} even after attempts in
the U.S. Senate to halt them, [the [Trump]{.mark} administration [will

### US Spoils Peace Process\-\--2AC

#### The US acts as a spoiler to the peace3 process

Savannah **Soter 18**, Yemen Peace Project Congressional Advocacy
Intern, 12/19/18, "TO ADDRESS ITS STRATEGIC CONCERNS, US NEEDS TO BACK
THE PEACE PROCESS,"
https://www.yemenpeaceproject.org/blog-x/strategic-peace

These [[advocates for the]{.underline} [s]{.underline}]{.mark}tatus
[[quo]{.underline} [fail to recognize]{.underline}]{.mark}, however,
[that current [US]{.mark} geopolitical [interests regarding
Iran]{.mark}]{.underline} [[are]{.mark} only [being harmed by this
campaign]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [US]{.underline} is complicit in the
[[perpetuation of violence]{.mark} and instability in
Yemen]{.underline}, not to mention thousands of civilian deaths, all of
which [[feeds the anti-American narratives]{.underline}]{.mark} [of
non-state actors like the Houthis and al-Qaeda, as well as
Iran]{.underline}. The fact remains that [[neither the current conflict
nor]{.underline}]{.mark} [the wider challenge of [Iranian expansion can
be solved by endlessly bombing and starving Yemen]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Instead, [[the solution]{.underline}]{.mark} to these challenges
[[depends on]{.underline}]{.mark} all parties (possibly including Iran)
[[sitting down to develop a plan for a sustainable political
settlement]{.underline}]{.mark}. UN envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths
recently mediated talks in Sweden that resulted in agreements on a
limited ceasefire and the release of prisoners. \[7\] Earlier this fall,
UK Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt visited Tehran, where he met with
several Iranian diplomats including Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, in an
effort to discuss bringing an end to the fighting within Yemen. \[8\]
What is significant about these international diplomatic efforts to end
the conflict is the absence of the US. Secretaries Mattis and Pompeo
both recently issued statements calling a ceasefire, but placed the onus
for such an action squarely on the Houthis. \[9\] President Trump later
undercut those modest efforts with his own statement absolving Saudi
Arabia of responsibility for its conduct in both the war and the peace
process (as well as for the Saudi regime's premeditated murder of Jamal
Khashoggi). \[10\] Most recently, the US has delayed a UN Security
Council draft resolution which aimed to implement a limited ceasefire
and increase humanitarian aid to Yemen. While human rights groups have
called the draft disappointing in its limitations and lack of criticism
of Saudi Arabia, it is apparently still too bold for the US to support.
\[11\] [[The]{.mark} Trump [admin]{.mark}istration seems to have
effectively removed itself from the possibility of playing a
constructive role in the peace process, and [assumed the posture
of]{.mark} a [spoiler]{.mark} instead]{.underline}.

## Impact

### Russia Draw-In\-\--2AC

**Russia gets drawn in**

Ross **Harrison 16**, professor at the School of Foreign Service at
Georgetown University and a scholar at The Middle East Institute in
Washington, D.C., "Too Big to Fail: The Iran-Saudi Relationship," *The
Middle East Institute*, January 19, 2016,
<http://www.mei.edu/content/too-big-fail-iran-saudi-relationship>

[The latest [escalation]{.mark} in tensions [between Iran and Saudi
Arabia]{.mark} has set off alarm bells across the globe. There is a real
fear that failure to repair]{.underline} the rupture in [this
relationship [could]{.mark} lead to a [worsen]{.mark}]{.underline}ing
[of [the]{.mark}]{.underline} already dire humanitarian [[crisis in
Syria]{.mark}, further destabilize a]{.underline} perilously
[volatile]{.underline} region, and even impede the battle against
ISIS.\[1\] When Iraq, one of the region's most vulnerable and least
stable countries, offers to mediate between the far more powerful Iran
and Saudi Arabia, you know it's grim.\[2\]¶ However, regional states
alone cannot prevent the catastrophic effects that could come from
continued hostility between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Global powers need to
mount a diplomatic offensive to prevent this pivotal relationship from
falling further into the abyss, to rescue the fledgling peace process on
Syria, and keep ISIS from benefiting from the recent flare-up in
tensions.¶ The danger becomes apparent with an understanding that the
current conflict in the region is part of a three-tiered contest for
power, involving local, regional and international actors. [[Saudi
Arabia and Iran]{.mark} are the pivotal regional components in
the]{.underline} three-tiered [contest for power, and represent the
conduit [link]{.mark}ing international players, such as [the]{.mark}
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and
Russia, to the local players]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} the conflict zones of
[[Syria]{.underline}]{.mark}, Iraq [[and Yemen.]{.underline}]{.mark}
[The healthier the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Iran, the
greater the opportunities for international actors like Russia and the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to engage
constructively]{.underline} with local players in Syria and other
hotspots in the Middle East to try [to reduce conflict]{.underline}.
Conversely, [[Iranian-Saudi hostility makes it]{.mark}
**[virtually]{.mark} [impossible]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} international
powers [to work]{.mark} effectively [towards conflict
mitigation]{.mark}]{.underline} on the ground. [Worse yet, ongoing
[tensions]{.mark} between Tehran and Riyadh [increases the risk of
foreign powers being]{.mark} further **[drawn into]{.mark}** [conflict
zones]{.mark} such as Syria, Iraq and Yemen]{.underline}, and ensures
chaos across the three levels.¶ The Local Level: Effects of the
Iran-Saudi Row¶ [Increased hostility between Iran and Saudi Arabia will
further the nightmare in Syria]{.underline}, the epicenter of the
current regional instability. [Iran will]{.underline} likely [redouble
its efforts to fortify the Assad regime and the Saudis will ramp up
support for rebel groups]{.underline}, in an attempt by each side to
gain the upper hand. Moreover, [if a rupture in Iran-Saudi relations
leads to a collapse of the diplomatic track, military action on the
ground in Syria once again becomes unhinged from the political
process]{.underline}. Efforts by Jordan to vet rebel groups and create a
moderate front with which to negotiate with the Assad regime will likely
end abruptly, potentially fracturing rebel groups.\[3\]
[Fighting]{.underline}, thus, [will take on a new
intensity]{.underline}, with more Syrian towns experiencing the same
horrific fate of starvation as Madaya.\[4\]¶ ISIS could become the
largest beneficiary of the hostility between Iran and Saudi Arabia, as
it operates outside the proxy war zone in Syria. [ISIS will escape the
spotlight as Iran and Saudi Arabia pour their energy to fight their
proxy war]{.underline} in Syria.¶ The Regional Level: Effects of the
Iran-Saudi Row¶ [Continued hostility]{.underline} between Iran and Saudi
Arabia [will increase the levels of regional polarization along
sectarian and political lines]{.underline}. This has already begun.
Almost all Arab League ministers---with the exception of Lebanon---in a
recent communiqué backed Saudi Arabia in its spat with Iran over Sheikh
Nimr al-Nimr's execution and the subsequent sacking of the Saudi embassy
in Tehran.\[5\] Such politically charged gestures are difficult to
rescind, making it hard to move towards regional rapprochement and
almost impossible to settle the region's current conflicts. [Added to
this is the danger that Turkey will further tilt toward Riyadh in this
conflict, undermining the potential that it could serve]{.underline} an
invaluable role [as balancer and mediator]{.underline}.\[6\] [A
convergence of the Arab and Turkish positions in this dispute could
increase anxieties in Tehran]{.underline}, perhaps resulting in a
[strengthening]{.underline} of the [hardliners]{.underline} in the
February parliamentary and Assembly of Experts elections. [This could
produce a more adventurous Iran at a time when the Saudis themselves
have become]{.underline} more [openly aggressive]{.underline}. While
these possible trends toward further regional polarization do not
necessarily portend direct armed conflict between them, it will
certainly reduce their capacity and will to tackle the problems that are
currently feeding regional dysfunction.¶ The International Level:
Effects of the Iran-Saudi Row¶ The days of the "Great Game" in the
Middle East are over. Whereas there was a time when actions by global
actors were able to shape relationships and events in the Middle East,
today the dynamic can go both directions, with regional actors having
the capacity to influence relationships at the global level. A case in
point is the potential for hostility between Saudi Arabia and Iran to
increase tensions between the United States and Russia. [While the
U.S.-Russian relationship has been continuously fraught with tension
over Syria, with each backing opposing sides in the conflict, they seem
to agree]{.underline} on the principle [that there is no pure military
solution to the war]{.underline}. Evidence of this was the opening up of
a diplomatic track shortly after the Russians entered Syria, despite
initial U.S. reservations about Russia\'s direct military
involvement.\[7\]¶ [[**U.S.-Russian cooperation could end**]{.mark} if
the Iranian-Saudi relationship leads to a failure of diplomacy in the
Syrian civil war]{.underline}. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and
Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir have thus far committed their
countries to be represented at the next round of diplomatic talks.\[8\]
If Iran and Saudi Arabia come only grudgingly to the talks to promote
their competing regional agendas, or instead use this forum to close the
diplomatic window, then this leaves both the Washington and Moscow
holding the bag. [If the diplomatic process collapses, the most robust
[opportunities for cooperation]{.mark} between the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and Russia [could
**vaporize**]{.mark}]{.underline}, given they have differing military
priorities, [with Russia focused on fortifying the Assad regime and the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [focused on dislodging ISIS.
[The result could be **further military entrenchment**]{.mark} by both
global powers [and a **hardening of positions**]{.mark}. Moreover, if
Iran and Saudi Arabia add fuel to their proxy war in Syria, the U.S. and
Russian forces on the ground might find it hard to avoid being drawn
further into the fight, in effect trapping the two global powers in an
unwinnable and intractable situation]{.underline}. Russia, in a
desperate but vain attempt to show gains before getting out of Syria,
could ramp up its efforts to support Assad militarily. [[The risk of a
direct]{.mark} [clash]{.mark}]{.underline}, with the margins for error
narrowing, [[between the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and Russia is]{.underline}]{.mark} thus
**[[elevated]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### Draws in Russia and escalates arms race

Peter **Beaumont 15**, Journalist for the Guardian, 4/23/15, "The \$18bn
arms race helping to fuel Middle East conflict,"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/23/the-18bn-arms-race-middle-east-russia-iran-iraq-un

Borck says that [the scale of the arms being supplied to]{.underline}
countries such as [Saudi Arabia]{.underline} and the UAE by the west
[may also be acting as an incentive for Russia to get back into the
Middle East]{.underline} -- [not least via arms sales to its old clients
such as Iran]{.underline} -- and may have been a motivating factor in
the Kremlin's decision to lift the ban on the delivery of the S-300
missile system.

Putin, defending the decision to supply the missiles during a call-in
television show last week, cited Russia's prerogative to pursue its own
foreign policy initiatives and suggested that the missiles could
represent "a deterrent factor in connection with the situation in
Yemen".

Omar Ashour, an expert on Middle East security issues at Exeter
University, has sounded a further note of caution, this time over the
intentions of the new Saudi-led Arab coalition, warning that its
interventions are unlikely to contribute to stability. "The rise of Arab
military coalitions raises serious concerns," he wrote in a recent piece
for Project Syndicate. "Such interventions were usually aimed at
empowering a proxy political force over its military and political
rivals, instead of averting humanitarian disaster or institutionalising
a non-violent conflict-resolution mechanism following a war."

Speaking to the Guardian last week, he added: "On top of that, [the
increases in arms sales are bound to be extremely
destabilising]{.underline}. At the moment most of the interventions have
been against softer targets -- Saudi Arabia targeting guerrillas in
Yemen; Egypt against Bedouin in Sinai; or strikes against ragtag armies
in Libya. But if the 'soft' keeps being hit hard, they won't remain
soft. They will find their own patrons and proxies and hit back and [it
will lead to a vicious cycle]{.underline}."

#### Middle East crisis wrecks the global economy

Tony **Walker 19**, Adjunct Professor, School of Communications, La
Trobe University, 5/20/19, "Trouble in the Gulf as US-Iran dispute
threatens to escalate into serious conflict,"
https://theconversation.com/trouble-in-the-gulf-as-us-iran-dispute-threatens-to-escalate-into-serious-conflict-117081

[The last thing the world needs at a moment of significant trade
tensions between the United States and China is [a Middle East
crisis]{.mark} that [would]{.mark} further [imperil global
growth]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Yet this is what is threatening [in the Persian Gulf]{.underline},
[where [the US and]{.mark} its [Arab allies are edging towards a
showdown with Iran]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in a]{.mark} contested
[waterway through which 20% of]{.mark} the world's [tradeable oil passes
daily]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In coordination with its Arab allies, notably Saudi Arabia, and with
Israel, the US is ratcheting up pressure on Iran to wind back its
support for what it terms "bad actors" in the region.

This includes Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon, radical groups in the
Palestinian territories, including Hamas, the Houthis in Yemen, and
disaffected anti-regime elements in the Gulf.

[[While the US denies it]{.mark} is seeking to bring about [regime
change in Iran]{.mark}, this clearly [is its hope]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Conflict is not inevitable, but risks are elevated by combative talk --
and actions -- from a Washington that seems bent on engaging in the sort
of brinkmanship that threatens more serious conflict in a region already
on edge]{.underline}.

Washington's deployment of an aircraft carrier battle group and B-52
bombers in the Gulf region is amplifying concerns.

President Donald Trump is not helping; to the contrary.

On one hand, he invites Iran's leaders to talk. On the other, he warns
of that country's annihilation.

This sort of bombast, the antithesis of wielding a big stick and talking
softly, coincides with tightening US sanctions that are doing
significant damage to Iran's economy.

These measures include sanctions imposed this month on Iran's industrial
metals sector. This sector accounts for about 10% of its export economy.

How Tehran responds to these harsh assaults on its economic lifelines is
anyone's guess, but what is certain is that its response will not be
passive.

Already this month we have witnessed two sets of terrorist attacks on
Gulf oil interests Iran, or its proxies, are blamed for an assault on
four ships in which explosives damaged the hulls. Two of these vessels
are Saudi-owned. In the second, Iran proxies are blamed for drone
strikes on a Saudi Arabian oil pipeline.

In response to terrorist threats to its eastern oil-rich provinces,
Saudi Arabia's state-controlled media have begun calling for "surgical
strikes" against Iranian interests.

Such action would provoke a wider conflagration.

What tends to be overlooked in all of this is the ease with which Iran,
on a previous occasion, stifled oil shipments from the Gulf.

In 1984, Iran was widely believed to have been responsible for rolling
second world war mines into Gulf waterways in the so-called "tanker war"
with Iraq. This destroyed several vessels and brought tanker traffic to
a halt for weeks.

Adding to jitters are recent reports that a Katyusha rocket fell near
the American embassy in central Baghdad. Iranian-backed militias, with
their strongholds across the Tigris River in the east of the city, are
suspected of launching the rocket.

Washington had already ordered non-essential US personnel out of
Baghdad. Oil giant ExxonMobil has begun moving employees out of the
region. The US has warned commercial air traffic of increased risks in
the Gulf.

This is a movie we have seen before, in the first Gulf War and in the
2003 invasion of Iraq to remove Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.

Iran proved to be a significant beneficiary of the chaos that resulted
from a destabilisation of the Middle East following the US-led invasion.

[[None of this is contributing to a stable oil
market]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[on which the global economy
rests]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Goes Nuclear

Stein **Tønnesson 15**, Research Professor, Peace Research Institute
Oslo; Leader of East Asia Peace program, Uppsala University, 2015,
"Deterrence, interdependence and Sino--US peace," International Area
Studies Review, Vol. 18, No. 3, p. 297-311

Several [recent works]{.underline} on China and Sino--US relations [have
made]{.underline} substantial [contributions to the current
understanding of how and under what circumstances]{.underline} a
combination of [nuclear deterrence and economic interdependence may
reduce the risk of war between major powers]{.underline}. At least four
conclusions can be drawn from the review above: first, those who say
that [interdependence may both inhibit and drive conflict]{.underline}
are right. [Interdependence raises the cost of conflict]{.underline} for
all sides [but]{.underline} [asymmetrical or unbalanced dependencies and
[negative trade expectations]{.mark}]{.underline} may [[generate
tensions leading to trade wars]{.mark} among interdependent states
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} in turn [[increase]{.mark} the [risk of
military conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} (Copeland, 2015: 1, 14, 437;
Roach, 2014). The risk may increase if one of the interdependent
countries is governed by an inward-looking socio-economic coalition
(Solingen, 2015); second, the risk of war between China and the US
should not just be analysed bilaterally but include their allies and
partners. Third party countries could drag China or the US into
confrontation; third, in this context it is of some comfort that the
three main economic powers in Northeast Asia (China, Japan and South
Korea) are all deeply integrated economically through production
networks within a global system of trade and finance (Ravenhill, 2014;
Yoshimatsu, 2014: 576); and fourth, [decisions for war]{.underline} and
peace [are taken by very few people, who act on the basis of their
future expectations]{.underline}. International relations theory must be
supplemented by foreign policy analysis in order to assess the value
attributed by national decision-makers to economic development and their
assessments of risks and opportunities. [[If
leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} on either side of the Atlantic [begin to
[seriously]{.mark} fear or [anticipate]{.mark} their own nation's
[decline]{.mark}]{.underline} then [[they may blame]{.underline}]{.mark}
this on [[external dependence]{.mark}, appeal to anti-foreign
sentiments, contemplate the use of force to gain]{.underline} respect or
[credibility, adopt protectionist policies, [and]{.mark}]{.underline}
ultimately [[refuse to be deterred by]{.underline}]{.mark} either
[[nuclear arms]{.mark} or prospects of socioeconomic calamities. Such a
dangerous shift could happen abruptly]{.underline}, i.e. under the
instigation of actions by a third party -- or against a third party.

Yet as long as there is both nuclear deterrence and interdependence, the
tensions [in East Asia]{.underline} are unlikely to escalate to war. As
Chan (2013) says, all states in the region are aware that they cannot
count on support from either China or the US if they make provocative
moves. [[The greatest risk is]{.mark} not]{.underline} that [a
territorial dispute]{.underline} leads to war under present
circumstances [but [that changes in the world economy]{.mark} alter
those circumstances in ways that [render inter-state peace]{.mark} more
[precarious]{.mark}]{.underline}. If China and the US fail to rebalance
their financial and trading relations (Roach, 2014) then a trade war
could result, interrupting transnational production networks, provoking
social distress, and exacerbating nationalist emotions. [This could have
unforeseen consequences in the field of security, with nuclear
deterrence remaining the only factor to protect the world from
Armageddon, and unreliably so]{.underline}. [[Deterrence could
lose]{.mark} its [credibility]{.mark}]{.underline}: one of the two
[[great powers might gamble]{.mark} that the other yield [in a
cyber]{.mark}-war [or conventional]{.mark}]{.underline} limited
[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}, or third party countries might engage in
conflict with each other, with a view to obliging Washington or Beijing
to intervene.

### XT Impact\-\--1AR

#### Economic crisis causes global war\-\--defense is wrong 

Qian **Liu 18**, Managing Director of Greater China for The Economist
Group, previously director of the global economics unit and director of
Access China for the Economist Intelligence Unit, PhD in economics from
Uppsala University, Sweden, 11/13/18, "The next economic crisis could
cause a global conflict. Here\'s why,"
<https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/11/the-next-economic-crisis-could-cause-a-global-conflict-heres-why/>

The [response to the 2008]{.underline} economic [crisis]{.underline} has
[relied far too much on monetary stimulus]{.underline}, in the form of
quantitative easing and near-zero (or even negative) interest rates,
[and]{.underline} included [far too little structural reform. This
means]{.underline} that [[the next crisis could]{.mark} come soon -- and
[pave the way for]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[large-scale military
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The next economic crisis is closer than you think. But what you should
really worry about is what comes after: [[in the current]{.mark} social,
[political]{.mark}, and technological [landscape]{.mark}, a
[prolonged]{.mark}]{.underline} economic [[crisis]{.mark}, combined with
rising]{.underline} income [inequality, [could]{.mark}]{.underline} well
[[escalate into]{.mark} a major [global military
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The [20[08]{.mark}]{.underline}-09 global financial crisis
[[almost]{.underline}]{.mark} bankrupted governments and [[caused
systemic collapse]{.mark}. Policymakers managed to pull the global
economy back from the brink, using massive monetary
stimulus]{.underline}, including quantitative easing and near-zero (or
even negative) interest rates.

But monetary stimulus is like an adrenaline shot to jump-start an
arrested heart; it can revive the patient, but it does nothing to cure
the disease. Treating a sick economy requires structural reforms, which
can cover everything from financial and labor markets to tax systems,
fertility patterns, and education policies.

Policymakers have utterly failed to pursue such reforms, despite
promising to do so. Instead, they have remained preoccupied with
politics. From Italy to Germany, forming and sustaining governments now
seems to take more time than actual governing. And Greece, for example,
has relied on money from international creditors to keep its head
(barely) above water, rather than genuinely reforming its pension system
or improving its business environment.

The [lack of structural reform has meant]{.underline} that the
[unprecedented excess liquidity]{.underline} that central banks injected
into their economies [was not allocated to its most efficient uses.
Instead, it raised global asset prices to levels even higher than those
prevailing before 2008]{.underline}.

In the United States, housing prices are now 8% higher than they were at
the peak of the property bubble in 2006, according to the property
website Zillow. The price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, which measures
whether stock-market prices are within a reasonable range, is now higher
than it was both in 2008 and at the start of the Great Depression in
1929.

As monetary tightening reveals the vulnerabilities in the real economy,
the collapse of asset-price bubbles will trigger [[another]{.mark}
economic [crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} -- one that [[could be even more
severe]{.underline}]{.mark} than the last, [[because]{.mark} we have
built up a tolerance to our strongest macroeconomic medications. [A
decade of]{.mark}]{.underline} regular adrenaline shots, in the form of
ultra-low interest rates and [[unconventional monetary policies]{.mark},
has severely [depleted their power to stabilize]{.mark} and stimulate
[the economy]{.mark}]{.underline}.

If history is any guide, the [consequences]{.underline} of this mistake
[could extend far beyond the economy]{.underline}. According to
Harvard's Benjamin Friedman, [prolonged]{.underline} periods of
[economic distress have been characterized]{.underline} also
[by]{.underline} public [antipathy toward]{.underline} minority groups
or [foreign countries]{.underline} -- attitudes [that can]{.underline}
help to [fuel]{.underline} unrest, [terrorism, or even war]{.underline}.

For example, during the Great Depression, US President Herbert Hoover
signed the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, intended to protect American
workers and farmers from foreign competition. In the subsequent five
years, global trade shrank by two-thirds. Within a decade, World War II
had begun.

To be sure, WWII, like World War I, was caused by a multitude of
factors; [there is no standard path to war. But]{.underline} there is
reason to believe that [high]{.underline} levels of [inequality can play
a significant role]{.underline} in [stoking conflict]{.underline}.

According to research by the economist Thomas Piketty, a spike in income
inequality is often followed by a great crisis. Income inequality then
declines for a while, before rising again, until a new peak -- and a new
disaster. [Though causality has yet to be proven, given the limited
number of data points,]{.underline} [this correlation should not be
taken lightly]{.underline}, especially with wealth and income inequality
at historically high levels.

This is [all the more]{.underline} worrying [[in view
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[numerous]{.mark} other [factors
stoking]{.mark} social unrest and [diplomatic tension]{.mark}, including
technological disruption]{.underline}, a record-breaking
[migration]{.underline} crisis, [anxiety over globalization, political
polarization, and]{.underline} rising [nationalism. All]{.underline} are
symptoms of failed policies that [could]{.underline} turn out to [be
trigger points for a future crisis]{.underline}.

Voters have good reason to be frustrated, but the emotionally appealing
populists to whom they are increasingly giving their support are
offering ill-advised solutions that will only make matters worse. For
example, despite the world's unprecedented interconnectedness,
[multilateralism is increasingly being eschewed, as
countries]{.underline} -- most notably, Donald Trump's US -- [pursue
unilateral, isolationist policies]{.underline}. Meanwhile, proxy wars
are raging in Syria and Yemen.

[Against this background]{.underline}, we must take seriously the
possibility that [[the next]{.mark} economic [crisis could lead
to]{.mark} a [large-scale military confrontation]{.mark}]{.underline}.
By the logic of the political scientist Samuel Huntington , considering
such a scenario could help us avoid it, because it would force us to
take action. In this case, the key will be for policymakers to pursue
the structural reforms that they have long promised, while replacing
finger-pointing and antagonism with a sensible and respectful global
dialogue. The alternative may well be [global
conflagration]{.underline}.

### Brink/AT: Resilience\-\--2NC

#### There's no [immediate risk]{.underline} to the economy, but [potential exists]{.underline} for escalating collapse

Barry **Sterland 17**, Visiting Fellow - Global Economy and Development,
Brookings Institution, 2/24/17, "Part II: Global financial resilience in
a time of uncertainty,"
https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2017/02/24/part-ii-global-financial-resilience-in-a-time-of-uncertainty/

[How fragile is the global economy today?]{.underline} Or as former
United States Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner puts it, "Where is the
dry tinder?" And how well placed are key economies to mitigate of
economic or financial shocks through the use of macroeconomic policy?

Up front, I should note that [[immediate risks]{.mark} appear to [have
eased]{.mark} over the last year]{.underline}, and [particularly in the
last six months. [Growth]{.mark} in the largest economies [has
strengthened]{.mark}]{.underline} somewhat, [risks of [deflation have
receded]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [firmer commodity prices have assisted
many emerging and developing economies. [But]{.mark}]{.underline} just
as you don't wait until you see smoke to assess fire risk, so [[it is
important to assess]{.mark} the global economy's [risk]{.mark} profile
[separately from immediate indicators]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, if
the recovery strengthens it will be critical to use the breathing room
to mitigate the longer term risks which are the focus of this blog.

Any assessment of underlying global economic risks needs to start by
evaluating risks located at the core of the global economy. [[Each of
the major]{.mark} advanced systemic [economies]{.mark}---[the U.S.,
Eurozone, and]{.mark} [Japan]{.mark}]{.underline}---still [[face legacy
risks]{.mark} from the crisis]{.underline}. On most counts, [[the others
are significantly more fragile]{.mark} than the U.S., [and have]{.mark}
even [less]{.mark} macroeconomic [firepower]{.mark}]{.underline}. And
[new risks are still growing in China]{.underline} commensurate with its
weight in, and linkages to, the global economy. [Political risks
are]{.underline} also [elevated both in individual
economies]{.underline}, particularly the Eurozone, [and
globally]{.underline}, including from the risks associated with a less
predictable approach from the U.S. administration on trade and
macroeconomic policies.

[In Europe, slow nominal growth has exacerbated weakness in the
financial sector]{.underline} and imbalances across the eurozone. Recent
signs of growth picking up, while welcome, will ease but not
substantially remove this risk. While increased capital buffers and
financial regulation and oversight is much improved on the pre-crisis
situation, parts of the banking system retain legacy weaknesses of bad
debts and poor profitability. The insurance sector faces long term
solvency issues. As with the U.S., [[regulatory
changes]{.underline}]{.mark} aimed at ending "too big to fail"
[[have]{.underline}]{.mark} also likely [[reduced flexibility to manage
a crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}. And significant financial and fiscal
vulnerabilities remain in Italy and the peripheral states.

In total, these weaknesses ensure that the eurozone will remain a
potential source of global risk for some time. Monetary policy
normalization is some way off. While some parts of the eurozone have
fiscal room to move---Germany in particular---others are highly
constrained.

Brexit will add to both political and economic risks in the eurozone.
Even a cooperative outcome will reduce potential growth over time given
the likely negative impacts on trade. If handled poorly it could produce
some unpleasant surprises which add to existing geopolitical and
financial risks.

[[The Japanese]{.mark} financial [system faces]{.mark}]{.underline}
ongoing [[stress from low]{.underline}]{.mark} nominal [[growth and
stretched]{.mark} macroeconomic [settings]{.mark}]{.underline}. These
settings, while probably necessary for the moment, are not sustainable.
This raises risks of corrections at some point. Again recent signs of
growth ease slightly the immediacy of these risks but do not
substantially remove them. And [[Japan has]{.underline}]{.mark} almost
[[no]{.mark} macroeconomic [policy space]{.mark} to respond to a
worsening of conditions]{.underline}.

Probably [the most important emerging global risk relates to the Chinese
financial system]{.underline}. It is exhibiting familiar warning signs
from previous instances of financial crises---rapid growth in non-bank
financial activity and corporate debt, signs of mispricing risk, capital
outflow pressures. [Chinese regulatory arrangements are scrambling to
catch up with market developments, raising the risks of
mistakes]{.underline}.

China has some macroeconomic policy space to respond to adverse
developments, though monetary policy is constrained by the need to rein
in credit, and exchange rate policy constrained by a variety of
political and market factors. Fiscal policy probably has some room
(including to backstop parts of the Chinese financial system), though
this is diminishing with rapid growth in debt at all levels of
government.

While the Chinese financial system is not closely integrated
internationally, financial spillovers are increasing due to the growing
weight of the Chinese economy in global demand and therefore asset
valuations, tightly linked trade, and leakages from the system of
tightly regulated capital flows (and some limited opening of the capital
account). This financial risk is coming on top of the inherent
difficulty in managing several difficult transitions in the structure of
the Chinese economy. Experience and modelling suggests that the
spillovers from a slowdown in China on the Asian region and globally
would be large.

The new U.S. administration's approaches to fiscal, structural, trade
and currency policies add new unpredictable elements to the mix, both
positive and negative. This also comes at a turning point in the
monetary policy cycle, which can be associated with volatility as
expectations adjust.

REMAINING VULNERABILITIES IN KEY EMERGING ECONOMIES

Risks also exist in major emerging economies outside China, though there
has also been important progress that mitigates global risks in
important ways.

On the positive side there has been a general improvement in the
macroeconomic frameworks and financial regulation in many large emerging
economies (EMEs). Large Asian EMEs (including India and the ASEAN
economies) have established generally sound monetary and fiscal policy
frameworks, improved financial regulation and oversight, and retained
some room to move macroeconomic levers in response to shocks. Large
commodity exporters, such as Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Pacific-facing
Latin American countries, are withstanding large economic shocks without
generalized financial distress. Mexico is drawing on its strong
macroeconomic framework to absorb some of the risks arising from
uncertainty in the U.S. policy stance. Most EMEs are operating with
reasonably strong levels of reserves.

Important watch points remain though. Corporate debt is high in many
major EMEs. The banking sector in India has important weaknesses which
need to be addressed to support growth and reduce risk. Brazil and
Argentina are in the midst of difficult but necessary policy reform
exercises. Others, such as Turkey and several in South East Asia and
Latin America, have high levels of foreign currency denominated
corporate debt, which poses a vulnerability particularly if the U.S.
dollar strengthens. And some major EMEs retain important political
uncertainties which could continue to produce inconsistent or delayed
policy responses to growing imbalances or risks (e.g., Turkey, South
Africa, Nigeria). The size and volatility in gross international capital
flows introduces an ever present risk that existing buffers come under
pressure if there are significant economic and market events. And
developments in China and the US provide a major source of uncertainty,
including the interaction of these.

RISKS AND LIMITED RESPONSE OPTIONS

[[The]{.mark} [international economy]{.mark} continues to [provide
ample]{.mark}]{.underline}, though thankfully not uniform, "[dry
[tinder]{.mark}]{.underline}." Sustained effort will required to both
reduce factors and rebuild macroeconomic policy capacity.

This suggests [[we are in for a]{.mark}n extended [period
where]{.mark}]{.underline} both [global [risks are elevated and]{.mark}
macroeconomic [policy responses are constrained]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The global community will need to make the most of its limited
macroeconomic firepower in the event of a negative shock by coordinating
responses. [U.S. policy choices will be important in mitigating rather
than exacerbating]{.underline} the [risks in other major advanced and
emerging economies]{.underline} (with potential 'spillbacks' to U.S.
growth). Individual countries (that are able) need to "self-insure"
where possible, in particular carefully building solid macro-economic
and financial buffers as circumstances allow.

### Trade AO\-\--2AC

#### Yemen escalation wrecks trade

Alex **De Waal 16**, Executive Director of the World Peace Foundation
and Professor at Tufts, "Africa's \$700 Billion Problem Waiting to
Happen," 3/17/16,
http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/17/africas-700-billion-problem-waiting-to-happen-ethiopia-horn-of-africa/?page=full

[[The H]{.mark}orn [o]{.mark}f [A]{.mark}frica region [is central to the
world's maritime trade]{.mark}. It's]{.underline} also [beginning to
fall apart.]{.underline} Back in 2002, Meles Zenawi, then prime minister
of Ethiopia, drafted a foreign policy and national security white paper
for his country. Before finalizing it, he confided to me a "nightmare
scenario" --- not included in the published version --- that could upend
the balance of power in the Horn of Africa region. The scenario went
like this: Sudan is partitioned into a volatile south and an embittered
north. The south becomes a sinkhole of instability, while the north is
drawn into the Arab orbit. Meanwhile, Egypt awakens from its
decades-long torpor on African issues and resumes its historical stance
of attempting to undermine Ethiopia, with which it has a long-standing
dispute over control of the Nile River. It does so by trying to bring
Eritrea and Somalia into its sphere of influence, thereby isolating the
government in Addis Ababa from its direct neighbors. Finally, Saudi
Arabia begins directing its vast financial resources to support
Ethiopia's rivals and sponsor Wahhabi groups that challenge the
traditionally dominant Sufis in the region, generating conflict and
breeding militancy within the Muslim communities. Fourteen years later,
reality has exceeded Zenawi's nightmare scenario; not only has every one
of his fears come to pass, but Egyptian President Abdel Fattah [al-Sisi
and]{.underline} Saudi [King Salman]{.underline} bin Saud [are working
hand-in-glove on]{.underline} regional security issues --- notably in
[[Yemen]{.mark}]{.underline} and Libya --- [which has [raised]{.mark}
the [stakes of the]{.mark} long-running [Egypt-Ethiopia rivalry]{.mark}.
If the worsening tensions in the Horn of Africa erupt into military
conflict, as seems increasingly possible, it wouldn't just be a disaster
for the region --- it could also be a catastrophe for the global
economy. [Almost all]{.mark} of the maritime [trade between Europe and
Asia]{.mark}, about \$700 billion each year, [passes through the Bab
al-Mandab]{.mark}]{.underline}, the narrow straits on the southern
entrance to the Red Sea, en route to the Suez Canal. [An endless
procession of cargo ships and oil tankers passes within sight --- and
artillery range --- of both the Yemeni and African shores of the
straits.]{.underline} Zenawi's nightmare scenario, in other words, may
soon become the world's --- and no one has a white paper to prepare for
it. A crisis in the Horn of Africa has been a long time in the making.
The regional rivalries of today date back to 1869, when the Suez Canal
was opened to shipping, instantly making the Red Sea one of the British
Empire's most important strategic arteries, since almost all of its
trade with India passed that way. Then as now, the security of Egypt
depended on control of the Nile headwaters, 80 percent of which
originate in Ethiopia. Fearful that Ethiopia would dam the river and
stop the flow, Egypt and its colonial masters attempted to keep Ethiopia
weak and encircled. They did this in part by divvying up rights to the
Nile's waters without consulting Addis Ababa. For example, the
British-drafted Nile Waters Agreements, signed in 1929 and 1959,
excluded Ethiopia from any share of the waters. As a result, Egypt and
Ethiopia became regional rivals, intensely suspicious of each other.
[The Nile remains a high-profile source of tension]{.underline} between
the two countries to this day; Sisi's state visit last year to Ethiopia
failed to achieve much, in large part because of Egypt's unease over a
huge Ethiopian hydroelectric project on the Blue Nile. But another
important source of friction between the two countries has centered for
some time on two of Ethiopia's volatile neighbors --- Eritrea and
Somalia --- which Cairo has long viewed as useful partners to secure its
interests along the Red Sea littoral. Ethiopia has shown it will resist
what it views as Egyptian encroachment near its borders. From 2001 to
2004, for instance, Ethiopia and Egypt backed rival factions in Somalia,
which prolonged that country's destructive civil war. These fractures in
the Horn of Africa have been deepened by Saudi Arabia's reassessment of
its security strategy. Worried that the United States was withdrawing
from its role as security guarantor for the wider region, it resolved to
build up its armed forces and project its power into strategic
hinterlands and sea lanes to the north and south. In practice, that has
meant winning over less powerful countries along the African coast of
the Red Sea --- Sudan, Eritrea, Djibouti, and Somalia --- a region that
Ethiopia has sought to place within its sphere of influence. [The
Saudi]{.underline} presence along the African Red Sea coast has grown
more sharply pronounced since its March 2015 military [intervention in
Yemen]{.underline}, which [drew in Egypt]{.underline} as part of a
coalition of Sunni Arab states battling Iran-backed Houthi rebels. [The
coalition obtained combat units from Sudan and Eritrea, and scrambled to
secure the entire African shore of the Red Sea. Then]{.underline} in
January of this year --- under pressure from Saudi Arabia --- [Djibouti,
Somalia, and Sudan all cut diplomatic ties with Iran.]{.underline} By
far the most significant of these was Sudan, which has had long-standing
political and military ties with Tehran. For years, Iranian warships
called at Port Sudan, and Iranian clandestine supplies to the
Palestinian militant group Hamas passed freely along Sudan's Red Sea
coast (occasionally intercepted by Israeli jet fighters). Now Sudan is
part of the Saudi-led coalition pummeling the Iran-backed Houthis. But
[the most important geopolitical outcome of the Saudi-led Yemen
intervention has been the rehabilitation of Eritrea, which capitalized
on the war to escape severe political and economic
isolation.]{.underline} After it gained independence from Ethiopia in
1993, Eritrea fought wars with each of its three land neighbors ---
Djibouti, Sudan, and Ethiopia. It also fought a brief war with Yemen
over the disputed Hanish Islands in the Red Sea in 1995, after which it
declined to reestablish diplomatic relations with Sana'a and instead
backed the Houthi rebels against the government. After the
Ethio-Eritrean border war of 1998-2000, Eritrea became a garrison state
--- with an army of 320,000, it has one the highest
soldier-to-population ratios in the world --- and Ethiopia led an
international campaign to isolate it at the African Union, United
Nations, and other international bodies. This was made easier by
Eritrea's increasingly rogue behavior, including backing al-Shabab
militants in Somalia. The imposition of U.N. sanctions in 2009 brought
the country to the brink of financial collapse. But [the war in Yemen
gave]{.underline} [Eritrean President]{.underline} Isaias [Afewerki a
get-out-of-jail-free card. He switched sides in the Yemen conflict and
allied himself with Saudi]{.underline} Arabia and its Gulf partners. [As
a result, the Eritrean president is now publicly praised]{.underline} by
the Yemeni government [and welcomed in Arab capitals. His government is
also reaping handsome if secret financial rewards in exchange for its
diplomatic about-face.]{.underline} But the fact that Eritrea has
decisively escaped Ethiopia's trap does not mean it has suddenly become
a more viable dictatorship. On the contrary, [the renewed geostrategic
interest in the country and its 750-mile Red Sea coast make the question
of who succeeds Afewerki, who has been in power for a quarter century,
all the more contentious]{.underline} --- especially since Ethiopia has
long sought to hand pick a replacement for the Eritrean president.
[Already, Ethiopia mounts regular small military sorties on the
countries' common border to let Eritrea know who is the regional
powerbroker. It would not take much for these tensions to explode into
open war.]{.underline} Saudi Arabia's revamped security strategy has
also meant a sudden influx of Arab funds into Somalia. The Saudis
promised \$50 million to Mogadishu in exchange for closing the Iranian
embassy, for example, while other Arab countries and Turkey have spent
lavishly to court the allegiance of Somali politicians. This is partly
intra-Sunni competition --- Turkish- and Qatar-backed candidates pitted
against those funded by the Wahhabi alliance --- but it also reflects
Somalia's increasing geopolitical importance. In the country's national
elections scheduled for September, Arab- and Wahhabi-affiliated
candidates for parliament could very well sweep the board. [All of this
has made Ethiopia very nervous --- as it should]{.underline}. The
tremors of the region's shifting tectonic plates may not directly cause
a major crisis. [The more probable outcome is deeper divisions between
Egypt and Ethiopia, which could cause a proliferation or deepening of
proxy disputes elsewhere in the region]{.underline}, such as the two
countries' competing efforts to shape the future leadership of Eritrea
and Somalia. Still, [it's impossible to rule out the possibility of a
dramatic security crisis stemming from]{.underline} the shifting
regional balance of power. It could come in the form of renewed fighting
over Eritrea's still-disputed land borders, or [[spinoffs from]{.mark}
the war in [Yemen, such as]{.mark} the eruption of [maritime
terrorism]{.mark}. That would lead to a dramatic escalation of the
militarization of the region. It [would]{.mark} also threaten to
[entirely close]{.mark} the region's [sea lanes]{.mark} --- the ones
that are [so central to global commerce.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Unfortunately, [the international community is sorely unprepared for
such an outcome.]{.underline} A well-established, multi-country naval
coalition patrols the sea lanes off Somalia's coast to combat piracy,
but [no international political mechanism currently exists to diffuse a
regional crisis]{.underline}. In [the relevant bureaucracies that might
be called upon in an emergency --- from the United Nations to the U.S.
State Department --- Africa and the Middle East are handled by separate
divisions that tend not to coordinate.]{.underline} The EU's special
envoy for the Horn of Africa, Alex Rondos, has taken the lead in
developing an integrated strategy for both shores of the Red Sea, but
the EU's foreign policy instruments are ill-suited to hard security
challenges such as this that span two continents.

The rise in isolationism and [[protectionism will bring
about]{.underline}]{.mark} ever more heated arguments and [[dangerous
confrontations]{.underline}]{.mark} [[over]{.underline}]{.mark} shared
sources of oil, gas, and other key [[commodities]{.underline}]{.mark} as
well as factors of production that must, out of necessity, be acquired
from less-than-friendly nations. Whether involving raw materials used in
strategic industries or basic necessities such as food, water, and
energy, efforts to secure adequate supplies will take increasing
precedence in a world where demand seems constantly out of kilter with
supply. Disputes over the misuse, overuse, and pollution of the
environment and natural resources will become more commonplace. Around
the world, such [[tensions will give rise to full scale military
encounters]{.underline}]{.mark}, often with minimal provocation. In some
instances, economic conditions will serve as a convenient pretext for
conflicts that stem from cultural and religious differences.
Alternatively, nations may look to divert attention away from domestic
problems by channeling frustration and populist sentiment toward other
countries and cultures. Enabled by cheap technology and the waning
threat of American retribution, terrorist groups will likely boost the
frequency and scale of their horrifying attacks, bringing the threat of
random violence to a whole new level. [Turbulent conditions will
[encourage aggressive saber rattling]{.mark}]{.underline} and
interdictions [[by rogue nations]{.underline}]{.mark} running amok[.
Age-old clashes will also take on a new]{.underline}, more [heated sense
of urgency]{.underline}. [China will]{.underline} likely [assume an
increasingly belligerent posture toward Taiwan,]{.underline} while [Iran
may embark on overt colonization of its neighbors in the
Mideast]{.underline}. Israel, for its part, may look to draw a dwindling
list of allies from around the world into a growing number of conflicts.
Some observers, like John Mearsheimer, a political scientist at the
University of Chicago, have even speculated that [an "intense
confrontation" between the United States and China is
"inevitable]{.underline}" at some point. More than a few disputes will
turn out to be almost wholly ideological. Growing [cultural and
religious differences will be transformed from wars of words to battles
soaked in blood]{.underline}. [Long-simmering resentments]{.underline}
[could]{.underline} also [degenerate quickly]{.underline}, spurring the
basest of human instincts and triggering genocidal acts. Terrorists
employing [[biological or nuclear weapons will]{.underline}]{.mark} vie
with conventional forces using jets, cruise missiles, and bunker-busting
bombs to [[cause widespread destruction]{.underline}]{.mark}. Many will
interpret stepped-up confl icts between Muslims and Western societies as
the [[beginning]{.underline}]{.mark}s of [[a new world

#### Stops bioterror

Patrick **Rose 14**, PhD international biodefense expert, 2/24/14, "DIY
Bioterrorism Part II: The proliferation of bioterrorism through
synthetic biology,"
http://www.cbrneportal.com/diy-bioterrorism-part-ii-the-proliferation-of-bioterrorism-through-synthetic-biology/

During the last half century [[terrorist
organizations]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[consistently had]{.mark} an
[interest in]{.mark} using [bio]{.mark}]{.underline}logical
[[weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} as a means of attacking their targets,
but only few have actually made a weapon and used it. The attraction is
that terrorist activities with biological weapons are difficult to
detect and even more difficult to attribute without a specific
perpetrator claiming responsibility. Since 1971 there have been more
than 113,113 terrorist attacks globally and 33 of them have been
biological. The majority of bio-terrorism incidents recorded occurred
during the year 2001 (17 of the 33); before 2001 there were 10 incidents
and since 2001 there were 6 (not counting the most recent Ricin
attacks). The lack of a discernable trend in use of bio-terrorism does
not negate the clear intent of extremist organizations to use biological
weapons. [In fact, the [capacity]{.mark} [to harness]{.mark} biological
[weapons more effectively today]{.mark} only [increases]{.mark} the
[risk]{.mark} that [they will]{.mark} successfully [be
employed]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The landscape is changing: previously the instances where biological
attacks had the potential to do the most harm (e.g., Rajneeshees cult's
Salmonella attacks in 1984, Aum Shinri Kyo's Botulinum toxin, and
Anthrax attacks in the early 90's) included non-state actors with access
to large amounts of funding and scientists. Funding and a cadre of
willing scientists does not guarantee success though. The assertion was
thus made that biological weapons are not only expensive, they require
advanced technical training to make and are even more difficult to
effectively perpetrate acts of terrorism with. While it is difficult to
determine with certainty whether the expense and expertise needed to
create biological weapons has acted as a major deterrent for groups
thinking of obtaining them, many experts would argue that the
cost/expertise barrier makes the threat from biological attacks
extremely small. This assertion is supported by the evidence that the
vast majority of attacks have taken place in Western countries and was
performed by Western citizens with advanced training in scientific
research.

In the past decade the cost/expertise assertion has become less
accurate. [Despite the lack of biological attacks, there are a number of
very dangerous and motivated organizations that have or are actively
pursuing biological weapons]{.underline}. The largest and most outspoken
organization has been [the global [Al Qaeda]{.mark}
network]{.underline}, whose [[leaders]{.mark} have [frequently]{.mark}
and passionately [called]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the [development]{.mark}
(or purchase) [of]{.mark} Weapons of Mass Destruction
([WMD]{.mark}).]{.underline} The principal message from Al Qaeda Central
and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ([[AQAP]{.underline}]{.mark}) has
[[included the call to use biological WMDs]{.mark} to terrorize Western
nations]{.underline}. Al Qaeda has had a particular focus on biological
and nuclear weapons because of their potential for greatest harm. Osama
Bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri and Anwar al-Awlaki have all called for
attacks using biological weapons, going so far as to say that Muslims
everywhere should seek to kill Westerners wherever possible and that
obtaining WMDs is the responsibility of all Muslims. Before the US-led
invasion of Afghanistan, Al Qaeda had spent significant funds on
building a bio-laboratory and had begun collecting scientists from
around the world; however, the Afghanistan invasion and subsequent
global War on Terrorism is thought to have disrupted their capabilities
and killed or captured many of their assets. Despite the physical
setbacks, this disruption does not appear to have changed the aggressive
attitude towards obtaining WMDs (e.g., more recently U.S. Intelligence
has been concerned about AQAP attempting to make Ricin).

#### Extinction

Action," Working Draft, The Lawfare Research Paper Series

Research paper NO . 2 -- 2013

As horrible as this would be, such a pandemic is by no means the worst
attack one can imagine, for several reasons. First, [most of the classic
bioweapons are based on 1960s and 19**70s** **technology** because the
1972 treaty halted bioweapons development efforts in the United
States]{.underline} [and most other Western countries.]{.underline}
Second, [the Russians]{.underline}, although solidly committed to
biological weapons long after the treaty deadline, [were never on the
cutting edge of biological research.]{.underline} Third and most
important, [the science and technology of molecular biology have made
enormous advances**, utterly transforming the field**]{.underline} in
the last few decades. [High school biology students]{.underline}
routinely [perform]{.underline} molecular-biology [manipulations that
would have been impossible even for the best superpower-funded program
back in the heyday of bio]{.underline}logical-[weapons
research]{.underline}. The biowarfare methods of the 1960s and 1970s are
now as antiquated as the lumbering mainframe computers of that era.
**[[Tomorrow's terrorists will]{.mark} have [vastly more deadly
bugs]{.mark} to choose from.]{.underline}** Consider this sobering
development: in 2001, Australian researchers working on mousepox, a
nonlethal virus that infects mice (as chickenpox does in humans),
accidentally discovered that a simple genetic modification transformed
the virus.10, 11 Instead of producing mild symptoms, the new virus
killed 60% of even those mice already immune to the naturally occurring
strains of mousepox. The new virus, moreover, was unaffected by any
existing vaccine or antiviral drug. A team of researchers at Saint Louis
University led by Mark Buller picked up on that work and, by late 2003,
found a way to improve on it: Buller's variation on mousepox was 100%
lethal, although his team of investigators also devised combination
vaccine and antiviral therapies that were partially effective in
protecting animals from the engineered strain.12, 13 Another saving
grace is that the genetically altered virus is no longer contagious. Of
course, it is quite possible that future tinkering with the virus will
change that property, too. Strong reasons exist to believe that the
genetic modifications Buller made to mousepox would work for other
poxviruses and possibly for other classes of viruses as well. Might the
same techniques allow chickenpox or another poxvirus that infects humans
to be turned into a 100% lethal bioweapon, perhaps one that is resistant
to any known antiviral therapy? I've asked this question of experts many
times, and no one has yet replied that such a manipulation couldn't be
done. This case is just one example. Many more are pouring out of
scientific journals and conferences every year. [Just last year, the
journal Nature published a controversial study]{.underline} done at the
University of Wisconsin--Madison [in which virologists enumerated the
changes one would need to make to a highly lethal strain of bird flu to
make it easily transmitted from one mammal to another.]{.underline}14
**[[Biotech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}** [[is advancing so
rapidly]{.mark} that [it is hard to keep track]{.mark} of all the new
potential threats]{.underline}. Nor is it clear that anyone is even
trying. [In addition to lethality and drug resistance, many other
parameters can be played with]{.underline}, given that the infectious
power of an epidemic depends on many properties, including the length of
the latency period during which a person is contagious but asymptomatic.
Delaying the onset of serious symptoms allows each new case to spread to
more people and thus makes the virus harder to stop. This dynamic is
perhaps best illustrated by HIV , which is very difficult to transmit
compared with smallpox and many other viruses. Intimate contact is
needed, and even then, the infection rate is low. The balancing factor
is that HIV can take years to progress to AIDS , which can then take
many more years to kill the victim. What makes HIV so dangerous is that
infected people have lots of opportunities to infect others. This
property has allowed HIV to claim more than 30 million lives so far, and
approximately 34 million people are now living with this virus and
facing a highly uncertain future.15 [A virus genetically engineered to
infect its host quickly, to generate symptoms slowly]{.underline}---say,
only after weeks or months---[and to spread easily through the air or by
casual contact **would be vastly more devastating than
HIV**]{.underline} . It could silently penetrate the population to
unleash its deadly effects suddenly. This type of epidemic would be
almost impossible to combat because most of the infections would occur
before the epidemic became obvious. [[A]{.mark} technologically
sophisticated [terror]{.mark}ist [group could]{.mark} develop such a
virus and kill a large part of humanity with it]{.underline}. Indeed,
[**terrorists may not have to develop it themselves: some scientist may
do so first and publish the details.** Given the rate]{.underline} at
which [biologists are making discoveries about viruses and the immune
system,]{.underline} at some point **[in the near future]{.underline}**,
**[someone may create artificial pathogens that could [drive the human
race to extinction.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Indeed, a detailed
species-elimination plan of this nature was openly proposed in a
scientific journal. The ostensible purpose of that particular research
was to suggest a way to extirpate the malaria mosquito, but similar
techniques could be directed toward humans.16 When I've talked to
molecular biologists about this method, they are quick to point out that
it is slow and easily detectable and could be fought with biotech
remedies. If you challenge them to come up with improvements to the
suggested attack plan, however, they have plenty of ideas. **[Modern
biotechnology will soon be capable, if it is not already, of bringing
about the demise of the human race]{.underline}**--- **[or at
least]{.underline}** [of killing a sufficient number of people to end
high-tech civilization and set humanity back 1,000 years or
more]{.underline}. That terrorist groups could achieve this level of
technological sophistication may seem far-fetched, but keep in mind that
[it takes only a handful of individuals to accomplish these
tasks]{.underline}. Never has lethal power of this potency been
accessible to so few, so easily. Even more dramatically than nuclear
proliferation, [modern biological science has frighteningly undermined
the correlation between the lethality of a weapon and its
cost]{.underline}, a fundamentally stabilizing mechanism throughout
history. [Access to extremely lethal agents]{.underline}---lethal enough
to exterminate Homo sapiens---**[will be available to anybody with a
solid background in biology, terrorists included.]{.underline}**

**BVP = bioengineered virulent pathogen**

While we cannot forecast the odds of [[a BVP]{.underline}]{.mark}, a
host of [experts believe]{.underline}s it [[is
inevitable]{.underline}]{.mark}. A National Defense University study of
the GMO threat found that "the tools and information required for
genetic modification of microorganisms are readily available worldwide."
[[They are]{.underline}]{.mark} also very [[cheap]{.underline}]{.mark},
and "the [[work can be]{.mark} successfully accomplished [by]{.mark} a
small cadre \[of [three people]{.mark}]{.underline}\]." This study
estimated that the [materials and facilities]{.underline} to weaponize a
bioagent [would cost]{.underline} about [\$250,000]{.underline}.
"Compared to other projects that might be undertaken by governments or
private organizations, the cost of equipping and staffing a laboratory
scale bioprocessing facility is trivial." They concluded that "the
[potential for corruption of biotechnology to catastrophic malevolent
use is considerable]{.underline}," with "tangible opportunities for many
potential adversaries to acquire, modify, and then manufacture to scale
a potential GMO pathogen."5

A BVP or other triggering disaster need not be all that effective in
killing infected victims to generate a collapse that kills additional
people and destroys the nation's strength. "Collapse" is defined here as
a cessation of most economic activity and the widespread lack of law and
order, for a prolonged period of time, with very high fatalities
(millions, more than 10 percent of the population). Indeed, [GMOs pose
an "existential threat]{.underline}," meaning a risk not just of
[killing]{.underline} millions of people, but potentially [billions,
wiping out civilization as we know it]{.underline}. An existential
threat is defined here as one that could kill most of the population
(more than 90 percent), causing a collapse that lasts beyond a few
years, with the level of pre-collapse civilization not returning for
generations.

Despite a largely rural population and relatively little international
travel, the bubonic plague wiped out about a third of Europe's
population in the mid-14th century. Today, over [[half]{.mark} of [the
world]{.mark}'s seven billion people [live in cities visited]{.mark}
daily [by international travelers. We are]{.mark}]{.underline} more
urbanized and densely packed, [[sustained by]{.underline}]{.mark} food
and water that arrives from distant locations, [relying on delivery
systems and [economic operations that]{.mark} may [shut down if there is
a]{.mark} lethal contagious [virus]{.mark}]{.underline} spreading and
people understandably do not report to work. Even those with the courage
to face the risk may change their mind when they realize they could
bring a fatal virus home to their families.

Those that do keep working, medics and police in particular, are likely
to catch the virus. We should expect that most [economic activity,
public services]{.underline}, production of essential goods, and
transportation [may cease]{.underline}. To minimize inventory costs,
[businesses, even hospitals, now have "just-in-time" delivery of
supplies]{.underline}, sourced from lowest-cost providers on the other
side of the world. Even if your local trucker decides to continue
working, with multiple long-distance suppliers and shippers involved in
moving foodstuffs, a contagious pandemic would certainly disrupt the
flow of essential goods. Panic-buying and hoarding will add to the
problem of getting food to the population. How long will our public
water supplies continue functioning when maintenance personnel fail to
report for work? Our highly interdependent, just-in-time delivery
economy is very vulnerable to disruptions. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, an
expert in risk and thinking about rare events, points this out: "Our
connected world appears to be more efficient. But when there is a
disturbance, the setback is much harder to handle. Not only are we
building riskier systems, but also the risks involved in failure are a
lot larger."6

When the availability of food and water is threatened, widespread
marauding may occur. In 1977, New York City suffered a lightning strike
that caused a power failure for one night. Over 3,000 arrests were made
for looting, 400 policemen were injured, 500 fires were started. In
2005, after Hurricane Katrina, looting rapidly spread throughout New
Orleans, often in broad daylight and in the presence of police officers.
One third of New Orleans police officers deserted their posts. Given the
example of these and other, relatively small disasters, what should we
expect in the event of the far more serious scenario of a deadly viral
pandemic? Pandemonium.

There are many more reasons why we are far more likely to suffer when a
widespread disaster hits tomorrow. For example, despite rising
population, we have fewer hospital beds and emergency rooms in the
United States today than even a few decades ago. Between 1990 and 2009,
emergency rooms in non-rural U.S. hospitals declined 27 percent from
2,446 to 1,779.

Some may not wait to exploit a disaster, they may loot and maraud
immediately. UK riots in 2011 showed that law enforcement can break down
and violence spread without a disaster to trigger them. Prime Minister
Cameron called it "pure criminality." Others said it was inevitable
violence from youth fed up with unemployment or family breakdown. The
attacks on police and looting started in London, but spread quickly to
other cities across the United Kingdom. Looting and violence grew as
more people took advantage of the opportunity and "marauding gangs"
formed. Police lost control of many areas. Innocent people were shot
dead in cars and robbed on streets. Thugs in Birmingham killed three men
trying to protect their businesses. The riots continued the following
night---and the next. Violence continued in London for four nights until
an extra 16,000 police officers moved in to restore order.

Criminal syndicates and gangs can accelerate the breakdown in law and
order and magnify marauder threats. The number of gang members in the
world is estimated at several million. The United States has tens of
thousands of gangs and perhaps a million gang members. The Salvadoran
MS-13 gang alone, known for brutal murders, has tens of thousands of
members dispersed throughout most U.S. states. Many people, not just
gang members, will use the disaster and the distraction of police as an
opportunity to loot.

[A major disaster could lead to economic and societal shutdown that
escalates in ways we cannot foresee]{.underline}, but we can assume
[they may be even worse than the losses from the trigger
event]{.underline}. A Defense Science Board study warned that even a
relatively benign cyber attack could trigger collapse:

"\[F\]ood and medicine distribution systems would be ineffective,
transportation would fail or become so chaotic as to be useless. Law
enforcement, medical staff, and emergency personnel capabilities could
be expected to be barely functional in the short term and dysfunctional
over sustained periods."7

The nation's leading agency for protecting against WMD, the Defense
Threat Reduction Agency, warns that we face the "inevitable emergency of
a new threat from biological and chemical agents." The Commission on the
Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism,
the international police agency INTERPOL, the former president of the
Royal Society of London all warn that bio-terror attacks could kill
millions. When Dr. Henderson, who led the World Health Organization's
global smallpox eradication campaign, predicts that a human
transmissible form of avian flu could injure and kill billions, that's a
credible warning of an existential threat. But none of this generates as
much public attention or political action as North Carolina's
transgender bathroom dispute.

As for why we are blind to this pending disaster, Nassim Taleb's The
Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable offers insights. A
"Black Swan" is an extreme impact event that is outside the realm of
regular expectations; nothing in the past can convincingly point to its
possibility. Concerning such events, Taleb warns that "things have a
bias to appear more stable and less risky in the past, leading us to
surprises . . . . The history of epidemics, narrowly studied, does not
suggest the risks of the great plague to come that will dominate the
planet."8

Taleb cites 27 [widespread [errors in]{.mark} human
[thinking]{.mark}]{.underline} processes and misapplications of
statistics to [[explain why we neglect]{.mark} Black Swan disasters like
[a coming BVP]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [People cling
to]{.underline}]{.mark} [current truths and [past experiences]{.mark}
that [new tech]{.mark}nologies and changing conditions]{.underline} may
soon [[render]{.underline}]{.mark} wrong or
[[irrelevant]{.underline}]{.mark}. We often fool ourselves with stories
and anecdotes, and even invent memories that calm us---but also
demobilize us. [What we don't see regularly, we tend to
ignore]{.underline}. We learn by repetition, react and decide by gut
feeling, thinking that we've thought it through and made a rational
choice when we often have not. "We are made to be superficial, to heed
what we see and not heed what does not vividly come to mind." Taleb
cites as examples the diaries of people prior to World War II---few had
any inkling that something momentous was taking place, that large-scale
war was coming. And indeed, while we hear much about Churchill's
warnings (and less about Lord Vansittart's even earlier and more
consistent warnings), his was a rare voice and ignored.

BVP "disaster blindness" may be stronger in the United States because
we, with the mightiest military, feel immune from attack. This is
precisely why a BVP is a likely weapon of choice for attacking the
United States. It could kill more people than even a large nuclear
attack, cause more lasting devastation and economic collapse, and best
of all for the attackers---they may get away with no retaliation since
we may never be able to determine or prove who released the virus.

Our government spends tens of billions of dollars every year to counter
nuclear threats because it's a long-standing, very obvious threat. The
threat of bio attack is much worse, both in terms of likelihood and of
the damage it will probably cause, yet relatively little is done to try
and counter or prepare. In 2012 a National Research Council committee on
chemical and biological defense scolded, "The United States probably has
not yet adequately embraced the opacity of the threat. It will be much,
much more difficult to prepare for and defend against than prior
threats."9 Indeed, when I interview biologists and researchers who
should be troubled by the coming BVP, their more immediate worry is that
their research will be curtailed or over-regulated. They believe that
biotechnology promises great advances in medicine and is a huge economic
opportunity---a belief echoed by business executives. Scientists I've
interviewed fear that warnings about BVP will lead to more regulations,
which would drive the research to other parts of the world where it's
not regulated. They also argue that it is too late to stop misuse of
this technology.

The Federal government is certainly aware of the bioterrorism risk, but
it is not a top priority. The lead agencies dealing with biotechnology
fund and promote the research. Until the first instance of disaster, it
is doubtful there will be strong action to prepare for the threat of a
BVP-induced collapse. Nothing major happens in Washington, DC, without
laws to direct the action, budgeting, and the commitment of top elected
officials. All are lacking now. There are no special interests and
lobbyists pushing for bioterrorism preparedness.

The initial or "triggering" Black Swan disaster may not be the biggest
thing to worry about. The "cascading effects" of an economic shut down,
the loss of law and order, looting and marauding, and the disruption of
health, sanitation, water, and transportation systems triggered by the
initial disaster may deliver much worse, longer-lasting damage. What
cascading problems will result when the electrical grid goes down? Can
nuclear reactors remain safely shut down when no one reports to work
because they don't want to risk viral exposure, and local water and
electric systems aren't functioning? With the police force overwhelmed
and ravaged by casualties (first responders are more likely to get the
virus), many officers will abandon their jobs to protect their families
from exposure. An explosion in violent crime could be worse even than
the virus.

[The real [uncertainty is]{.mark}]{.underline} not whether a BVP or
other Black Swan disaster will occur, but [[how bad it will be]{.mark}
and how deep of a collapse will result]{.underline} from it. [After the
first pandemic and collapse, it will]{.underline} likely [be impossible
to prevent repeat bio attacks]{.underline}. It may be the next epoch of
warfare and terrorism that defines the next era of "civilization." Most
writers covering the Biotech Age emphasize the great advances in
medicine and new means of production. But in a time when individuals can
wield the power to kill millions and cause a collapse, the outlook for
mankind may be more bleak than rosy. The destructive power of
deliberately malign GMOs and the uncontrollable ability of individuals
to unleash a BVP may yield a reversal in mankind's fortunes: shorter
life spans, crueler lifestyles, and perhaps a collapse of civilization
entirely.

Whether the first bioengineered virus comes from an accidental release
or is spread by some regime, the key point Taleb makes is that "[Black
Swans being unpredictable, [we need to adjust to their
existence]{.mark}]{.underline} (rather than naively try to predict
them)." Estimating, assuming, hoping that accidents, lunatics,
terrorists, or enemy states won't release a GMO, or that we can always
detect and stop them, is a mistake. As a nation, we must adapt to the
existence of the BVP threat now [[and change]{.mark} the [protocols of
our strategy]{.mark}, military forces, [economy]{.mark}]{.underline},
and preparedness [[to ensure]{.mark} the [consequences do not cascade
into]{.mark} societal [collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}. We need to be
prepared to deal with the consequences of a viral pandemic that produces
horrific numbers of casualties that cannot be stopped with a simple
quarantine. This problem deserves far more attention and resources.
While we likely can't stop the release of lethal new GMOs, we can
survive if we are ready.

Many of the obvious preparations are relatively low-cost. Households
need to have not days of stored food and water, but months. While the
Federal government won't recommend something so politically incorrect,
wise citizens should stockpile and know how to use guns and ammo. The
National Guard should train and equip its forces to implement
quarantines and support local law enforcement, and add a "Civil Ground
Patrol" (modeled on the Air Force's Civil Air Patrol) to train and build
a force of volunteers to help in disaster recovery and response efforts.

After the first pandemic hits there will be support for making bigger,
more wide-sweeping changes in every aspect of our foreign and defense
policies, economy, culture and society. Nuclear weapons may no longer be
seen as the most threatening weapons that should be eliminated, but a
vital instrument for prompt strikes to incinerate a bioweapon threat. An
exodus from large cities may result as people conclude that rural areas
are safer. International travelers would not enter the country within an
hour of arrival, but after days spent in quarantine communities where
they can work and recreate, but remain in a controlled state.

From the Stone Age through the Bronze, Iron and Industrial Ages to
today's Information Age, humans have enjoyed longer lifespans and
improving quality of life and civilization. Every major technological
advance has also been applied to new means of killing, such as the
mass-produced weapons and chemical agents developed in the World Wars of
the 20th century. Nuclear weapons were very difficult to make or hide,
and are held today still only by states. But new computer,
nanotechnology, and other [technological advances give individuals the
power to severely damage states and]{.underline} the
[societies]{.underline} they govern. [[Bioengineered
viruses]{.underline}]{.mark} created and released by an individual
[[could destroy]{.underline}]{.mark} a country and, perhaps, [[our
species. The more we do now to adjust to]{.mark} the threat of
[biotech]{.mark}nology]{.underline} and prepare for the Age of
Bioengineered Viral Pandemics and Collapse [[the more likely we are to
survive]{.underline}]{.mark}.

http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/hs.2017.0028

Historically, [disease events have been responsible for the greatest
death tolls on humanity. The 1918 flu was responsible for more than 50
million deaths]{.underline},1 while [smallpox killed perhaps 10 times
that many in the 20th century alone.]{.underline}2 [The Black Death was
responsible for killing over 25% of the European
population]{.underline},3 while [other pandemics]{.underline}, such as
the plague of Justinian, [are thought to have killed 25
million]{.underline} in the 6th century---constituting over 10% of the
world's population at the time.4 It is an open question whether
[[a]{.mark} future [pandemic could result in]{.mark} outright [human
extinction]{.mark} or the irreversible collapse of
civilization]{.underline}.

[A skeptic would have]{.underline} many good [reasons to think that
existential risk from disease is unlikely. Such [a disease would need to
spread worldwide]{.mark} to remote populations, overcome]{.underline}
rare [genetic resistances, [and evade detection]{.mark}]{.underline},
cures, and countermeasures. Even evolution itself may work in humanity's
favor: [[Virulence and transmission is]{.mark} often [a
trade-off]{.mark}]{.underline}, and so evolutionary pressures could push
against maximally lethal wild-type pathogens.5,6

While [[these arguments]{.underline}]{.mark} point to a very small risk
of human extinction, [they [do not rule the possibility
out]{.mark}]{.underline} entirely. Although rare, [[there are]{.mark}
recorded [instances of species going extinct due to
disease]{.mark}]{.underline}---primarily in amphibians, but also in 1
mammalian species of rat on Christmas Island.7,8 There [are also
historical examples of large human populations being almost entirely
wiped out by disease, especially when multiple diseases were
simultaneously introduced into a population]{.underline} without
immunity. The most striking examples of total population collapse
include native American tribes exposed to European diseases, such as the
Massachusett (86% loss of population), Quiripi-Unquachog (95% loss of
population), and theWestern Abenaki (which suffered a staggering 98%
loss of population).

In the modern context, no single disease currently exists that combines
the worst-case levels of transmissibility, lethality, resistance to
countermeasures, and global reach. But [many diseases are proof of
principle that each worst-case attribute can be realized
independently.]{.underline} For example, [[some]{.mark} diseases
[exhibit]{.mark} nearly a [100%]{.mark} case [fatality]{.mark} ratio in
the absence of treatment]{.underline}, such as rabies or septicemic
plague[. [Other diseases have a]{.mark} track [record of spreading
to]{.mark} virtually [every]{.mark} human [community
worldwide]{.mark},]{.underline} such as the 1918 flu,10 and
[seroprevalence studies indicate that other pathogens,]{.underline} such
as chickenpox and HSV-1[, can successfully reach over 95% of a
population]{.underline}.11,12 [Under optimal virulence theory, natural
evolution would be an unlikely source for pathogens with the highest
possible levels of transmissibility]{.underline}, virulence, and global
reach. [But [advances in biotech]{.mark}nology [might allow the creation
of diseases that combine]{.mark} such [traits]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Recent controversy has already emerged over a number of scientific
experiments that resulted in viruses with enhanced transmissibility,
lethality, and/or the ability to overcome therapeutics.13-17 Other
experiments demonstrated that mousepox could be modified to have a 100%
case fatality rate and render a vaccine ineffective.18 In addition to
transmissibility and lethality, [studies have shown that other disease
traits, such as incubation time, environmental survival, and available
vectors, could be modifie]{.underline}d as well.19-2

### XT Terrorism IL\-\--1AR

#### That checks [Iranian]{.underline} and [Saudi]{.underline} terrorism support

Jonah **Shepp 18**, Journalist for NYMag and the Intelligencer, 8/7/18,
"While Condemning Iran, the U.S. Contributes to Terrorism in the Middle
East, Too,"
http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/08/iran-us-contribute-terrorism-middle-east.html

While ostensibly at war with both AQAP and the Iran-backed Houthi
rebels, the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia see the latter as the more pressing
threat by far. Accordingly, the AP found, local [[militias supported by
the coalition]{.underline}]{.mark} frequently
[[recruit]{.underline}]{.mark} seasoned [[Al Qaeda]{.mark}
fighters]{.underline} [[into their ranks]{.mark} to fight the
Houthis]{.underline}, in deals allegedly brokered by Emirati agents and
greased with Saudi money.

The U.S. does not directly fund the coalition, and the investigation
found no evidence of American money making its way to AQAP militants.
Nonetheless, [[the U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[supported the
coalition with]{.mark} billions of dollars in
[weaponry]{.mark}]{.underline}, while providing intelligence and air
support, chiefly in the form of drone strikes. Money is fungible, and
[[every dollar]{.underline}]{.mark} [the U.S. spends on
weapons]{.underline} for the coalition [[is a dollar Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark} or the U.A.E. saves to [[spend
on]{.underline}]{.mark} bribing or recruiting
[[AQAP]{.underline}]{.mark} [jihadists]{.underline}. When our drones
hold off on bombing AQAP convoys while the coalition grants them safe
passage into their mountain hideaways, we are still complicit in a dirty
deal.

This doesn't make us any worse than Iran, but it underscores the reality
that in messy wars over failed states, nobody comes out with clean
hands. Not one participant in the humanitarian catastrophe that is the
Yemeni civil war has [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} mind the best interests
of [[Yemen]{.underline}]{.mark} as a country or the Yemeni people. [As
the [regional powers play]{.mark} their [grand strategy]{.mark} game and
attempt to muscle the country into their respective spheres of
influence, everyone on the ground is just scrambling to survive and to
expand their piece of a very small pie.]{.underline}

The attitude of local militia commanders was described to the AP thusly:
"We will unite with the devil in the face of Houthis." In this context,
the notion that we could intervene in Yemen and not end up doing
business with people who ought to be our enemies is almost ridiculous.

The same is true of Syria, where the U.S. has consistently had a hell of
a time sorting out the "good" rebel factions we can conscientiously
support from the jihadists we'd rather not. Despite our best efforts to
only arm the good guys, some of the weapons we dumped into Syria
inevitably fell into the hands of radical terror groups, including ISIS.

In Iraq, too, militias once supported by Iran have become partners of
the U.S. in our efforts to help that country beat back ISIS and restore
some vestige of stability. Alliances with paramilitary groups were also
a key component of the U.S. counterinsurgency operations during the most
violent years of our occupation of Iraq. Needless to say, that
occupation was itself among the most destabilizing events to befall the
Middle East in its modern history and has led to tens of thousands of
deaths from terrorism.

[[It's hard]{.mark} for the U.S. [to credibly condemn Iran for
supporting terrorism]{.mark} when]{.underline} every time
[we]{.underline} involve ourselves in a Middle Eastern conflict, [we
find ourselves contributing]{.underline} --- directly or indirectly,
wittingly or unwittingly --- to instability, violence, and yes,
terrorism. The means of our foreign policy in the Middle East are at
odds with its supposed ends. Our invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, our
attempts to tip the scales of the conflicts in Libya and Syria, and our
[[intervention in Yemen]{.mark} have only [exacerbated the region's
ills]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Our close relationship with Saudi Arabia, which easily rivals Iran as an
inspiration, sponsor, and financier of terrorism, is a big part of the
problem. [[By supporting Saudi hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
greater Middle East, [[we]{.underline}]{.mark} have
[[abetted]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[prolif]{.underline}]{.mark}eration
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[radical Islamist
ideology]{.underline}]{.mark} no less toxic than that of the Iranian
mullahs. Moreover, [[by keeping Iran in a constant state of
threat]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[we]{.mark} justify its leaders' paranoia
and [motivate them to counter]{.mark} the [Saudis with]{.mark} weapons
proliferation and [terrorist activities]{.mark} of their
own.]{.underline}

### XT Safe Haven IL\-\--1AR

#### Strong AQAP leads to quick and massive attacks

Katherine **Zimmerman 15**, research fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute and the lead analyst on al-Qa'ida for AEI's Critical Threats
Project, "AQAP: A Resurgent Threat," September 2015,
<https://www.ctc.usma.edu/v2/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CTC-SENTINEL-8-912.pdf>

Al-Qa\`ida in the Arabian Peninsula ([[AQAP]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[is
one of the]{.mark} few [beneficiaries of Yemen's collapse]{.mark} into
civil war]{.underline}. [It now governs one of the
country's]{.underline} three [major ports]{.underline} and has expanded
its operations in Yemen, benefiting from a larger recruiting pool.
[[AQAP's enlarged safe haven]{.mark}]{.underline} supports its efforts
locally but also [[serves as a sanctuary for]{.mark} the [external
operations]{.mark} cell that previously has threatened the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [several times]{.underline}.
[[The affiliate remains a]{.mark}l-[Q]{.mark}a\`ida['s greatest]{.mark}
direct [threat to the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, [and it is growing stronger]{.underline}.

Al-Qa\`ida's Yemen-based affiliate has been quietly expanding as the
country descends further into civil war. It may be one of the few
beneficiaries of Yemen's collapse, other than the Islamic State, which
is developing its own Yemeni franchise. Al-Qa\`ida in the Arabian
Peninsula ([AQAP]{.underline}) [has taken advantage of the turmoil to
try its hand at governance again]{.underline} [and build support among
Sunni tribes]{.underline} angered by the Huthi takeover of large swaths
of the country. Yemen's civil war has secured nearly all of AQAP's
immediate military objectives. The West retreated. [The [Yemeni]{.mark}
military and security [forces]{.mark}]{.underline}, what is left of
them, [[are no longer fighting AQAP]{.mark}. Those elements that
remain]{.underline} [are divided and degraded]{.underline}, operating
without a central command, and have no incentive to enter into another
fight. The Yemeni state is broken, and local authorities have filled the
void. Mediation efforts with Yemeni stakeholders have not yielded much
progress on the political front, and even if a new central government
emerges, it will have to work hard to rebuild relationships with
provincial and local authorities. Finally, there is an active insurgency
in Yemen rooted in Sunni communities that provides an opportunity for
AQAP to further establish itself.

[The conditions are ripe for success]{.underline}, and [AQAP is an
adaptive organization.]{.underline} [It appears to have learned from
strategic errors in 2011 and 2012]{.underline}, [which led to a popular
uprising]{.underline} against it. [The late]{.underline} AQAP
[emir]{.underline}, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, [advised his Algerian counterpart
in the summer of 2012 that, based on AQAP's experiences in Abyan,
meeting the people's basic needs was the first step in
governance]{.underline}.1 The group also appears to have copied tactics
from al-Qa\`ida's Syrian affiliate, Jabhat al-Nusra, and has better
integrated itself into the population, by using local governance
structures for example.2 Additionally, the broad mobilization of Sunnis
against Huthis is giving AQAP momentum on which to draw. This condition
was not present during the Arab Spring and will only further serve
AQAP's interests.

[[AQAP]{.mark}'s gains [in Yemen could have disastrous
consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}. [AQAP was behind at least four major
attempted attacks on U.S. interests outside of Yemen]{.underline}, [and
all of those occurred when the group was weaker than it is
toda]{.underline}y. [[AQAP is also still a key asset for]{.mark} the
[global al-Qa\`ida]{.mark} network]{.underline}, [providing overall
leadership guidance, sharing expertise, and coordinating transnational
attacks.]{.underline} [AQAP's growing strength in Yemen could
reverberate throughout the alQa\`ida network, raising the
stakes]{.underline} [in the competition between alQa\`ida and the
Islamic State to lead the global jihadist movement]{.underline}.3

Complicity,"
https://tcf.org/content/commentary/war-yemen-tragedy-america-can-end-complicity/?session=1

The murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi---a Saudi national and U.S.
resident who spent much of his career explaining the kingdom to
Americans and more recently adopted a critical approach---has brought
long overdue scrutiny to Saudi Arabia's most toxic and destabilizing
policies. Khashoggi's tragic death, apparently at the hands of a hit
squad dispatched by the Saudis' top leadership, has finally spurred the
United States to ask uncomfortable questions about its complicity in
Saudi policy. [[A critical mass of American politicians]{.mark} in both
parties now [have the opportunity to challenge Saudi]{.mark} preferences
and clarify American interests]{.underline}.

One of their top priorities should be to disentangle the United States
from the disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen. American policy in the Gulf
cannot be subsidiary to [[weapons sales]{.underline}]{.mark}: [[major
contracts must be reassessed]{.underline}]{.mark} so that they serve
American policy interests, rather than drive them. Finally, [[a
principled]{.underline}]{.mark} and strategically sound [[recalibration
on Yemen can spur a]{.mark}n even more [important
process]{.mark}]{.underline}: [the [revival of congressional oversight

reversing]{.mark} the militarization of foreign policy and rethinking
[the]{.mark} logic of America's reflexive and [unconstrained]{.mark}
global [war on terror]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Bipartisan frustration was already building over the trajectory of the
Yemen War and Saudi's seeming indifference to congressional concerns
even before Khashoggi's murder. The Trump administration is unlikely to
dramatically change course, but [[Congress has the authority]{.mark} to
restrain the worst excesses of America's involvement in Yemen and,
equally important, [to force a debate about our forever

## Democracy

### US Key\-\--2AC

#### US democratic norm promotion key

Adrian A. **Basora 17**, was the U.S. ambassador to the Czech Republic,
is director of the Foreign Policy Research Institute Eurasia Program and
Project on Democratic Transitions; and Kenneth Yalowitz, the director of
the Conflict Resolution Program at Georgetown University and a Global
Fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center, 2/16/17, "Democracy Promotion Is
Smart Security Policy,"
http://nationalinterest.org/feature/democracy-promotion-smart-security-policy-19469?page=show

During the first decade after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union,
President George H. W. Bush's goal of "a Europe whole and free" and a
wider world largely at peace seemed within reach. The deadly threats of
the Cold War were gone, and the democratic revolutions that appeared to
be sweeping through eastern Europe and elsewhere created optimism as to
the [[continuing progress of a liberal]{.mark} international
[order]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Now, two and a half decades later, that promising trend [[is being
reversed]{.underline}]{.mark}. The authoritarian resurgence in Europe
and elsewhere over the past decade has shaken our confidence that
liberal democracy, free markets and peaceful borders will continue to
dominate the post--Cold War international order.

From our being the "sole superpower" in the 1990s, [[U.S. global
influence]{.mark} and effective power [are]{.mark}]{.underline} now
[[challenged by China and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, the weakening of
the European Union [[and]{.mark} the [sharp domestic divisions revealed
by the]{.mark} U.S. [presidential campaign]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
United States and Europe are threatened by radical terrorists,
challenged by territorially expansionist autocracies, and targeted by
covert action, massive disinformation and propaganda offensives.

Russia and China, the world's two principal autocratic powers, lead the
way in consolidating their model domestically, but also in advocating
internationally for an alternative authoritarian model based on strident
nationalism, autocratic leadership, and repression of human rights and
the rule of law. [[Russia, through its]{.underline}]{.mark} covert
[[intervention in the]{.mark} U.S. [election]{.mark}]{.underline},
military actions in Ukraine and support of right-wing populist forces in
Europe, [[is working to undermine]{.mark} the system of [liberal
institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} laws and behavioral norms
that have bound Europe and the United States. Sadly, [[this]{.mark}
alternative model [is gaining ground]{.mark}]{.underline} in Europe and
elsewhere. The list includes formerly promising new democracies such as
Hungary, Turkey, Thailand, the Philippines---and now even Poland.

What is the connection between America's security and the state of
democracy in the world? [[Democratic countries]{.underline} [rarely, if
ever, go to war]{.underline}]{.mark} with each other or prey on their
neighbors. Democratic systems and free markets support each other and
sustain individual and group freedoms. Also, [the rule of
law]{.underline}, which subsumes all, [is best guaranteed by democratic
systems. Protection of the democratic order]{.underline}, now under
challenge, [must]{.underline} therefore [be one of the
priorities]{.underline} weighed [in our strategic decisionmaking
analysis and policy process]{.underline}. And democracy promotion via a
revised, realistic and targeted approach must remain a fundamental
national-security objective for the United States and its allies.

At a recent conference at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for
Scholars in Washington, DC on this subject, eleven experts of varying
political and operational perspectives all concluded that the
[[national-security interests]{.underline}]{.mark} of the United States
and its allies not only permit, but [[require, America to support
democracy]{.mark} abroad. [Not to do so would ignore an existential
threat]{.mark}]{.underline} to democracies, and [[to the]{.mark}
international [order that has allowed the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[to remain secure]{.underline}]{.mark}
and prosper.

## Congress CP Answers

### AT: Congress CP\-\--2AC

#### Perm do both

#### Perm do the CP

#### Nuclear sole authority [doesn't cause]{.underline} executive secrecy and the CP [doesn't solve it broadly]{.underline}, but it [does]{.underline} kill deterrence 

George **Perkovich 10**, director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 2/7/10, "Book review: \'Bomb
Power\' by Garry Wills," The Washington Post,
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/05/AR2010020501330.html>

For all the light [[Wills]{.underline}]{.mark} generates, however, his
[[argument is overheated]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
[[damage]{.underline}]{.mark} that [successive administrations and
congresses have done [to constitutional governance]{.mark}]{.underline}
since the Manhattan Project [[should not be blamed]{.mark} so narrowly
[on the bomb]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Had the bomb not been used]{.mark} in 1945,
[wouldn\'t]{.mark}]{.underline} the memory of [[Pearl Harbor,
and]{.underline}]{.mark} the emergence of [[the global contest
between]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S.-led democratic [[capitalism
and]{.underline}]{.mark} Soviet-led [[communism, have been enough to
induce]{.mark} the [centralization of executive power?]{.mark} To fight
an obsessively secret and ruthless adversary that had global ambitions,
wouldn\'t worst-case thinking have undermined]{.underline} the
deliberateness and openness required for good [democratic
governance?]{.underline}

[[If]{.mark} all [nuclear weapons were eliminated]{.mark}]{.underline}
everywhere, [[would the imperial presidency]{.underline}]{.mark}, abuse
of executive orders, [overdone [secrecy and]{.mark} reckless clandestine
[interference in other countries]{.mark}]{.underline} all [[cease? Would
Congress]{.mark} somehow [become more responsible]{.mark}]{.underline}
\-- in all senses of the word? [[To fight
terror]{.mark}ism]{.underline}, recent [[administrations and congresses
have adopted all the practices Wills abhors. Would we reform
these]{.mark} practices [if nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s
were]{.mark}]{.underline} somehow [[removed from the]{.mark}
terrorist-threat [menu?]{.mark}]{.underline}

Wills is certainly right that the bomb poses profound challenges to
American constitutional governance. Congress\'s sole authority to
authorize war is difficult to reconcile with the five minutes in which a
president would have to decide whether to order the launch of nuclear
weapons if the United States were under missile attack. The end of the
Cold War should allow alternative ways to balance nuclear deterrence
with deliberative decision-making. [[Secrecy is required to
interdict]{.mark} nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration [or prevent adversaries
from learning how to undermine]{.mark} the [deterrent effects of
U.S.]{.mark} nuclear [forces]{.mark}, but reforms clearly are necessary
to prevent secrecy from being abused to cover incompetence, folly,
criminality and military-industrial aggrandizement]{.underline}.

Having illuminated these dangers, \"[[Bomb Power]{.underline}]{.mark}\"
regrettably [[does not point]{.mark} the way [to
remedies]{.mark}]{.underline}. The bomb is no longer the solution to the
most pressing challenges facing the United States, if it ever was.
[Cooler heads are now needed to act on the alarm that Wills

[This]{.underline} curious [book addresses what [Scarry

democracy. But her knowledge of nuclear matters is
superficial]{.mark}]{.underline}, and she says very little about the
weapons, other than to draw attention to their awfulness and to the
fragile, illegitimate, and dangerous structures that govern their
possession and potential use. The book is mainly a treatise on the
social contract between individuals and governments. It includes some
interesting ruminations on the sources of consent and on human behavior
in emergencies. Even on such abstract matters, Scarry is reliably
readable. But [[having underlined]{.mark} the [absurdity of the nuclear
condition]{.mark}, in which fallible human beings can inflict terrible
destruction]{.underline} in a matter of minutes, [[she offers]{.mark}
only [a feeble remedy]{.mark}. Her proposal is [to

the]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. [[Constitution that distribute

does not explain]{.mark}]{.underline}, however,
[[how]{.underline}]{.mark} ordinary [[people in the

<https://www.sfgate.com/books/article/Bomb-Power-by-Gary-Wills-3275087.php>

Garry Wills is also very upset about George - but Bush, now. A prolific
author of astonishing range - from St. Augustine to Henry Adams to
Richard Nixon - Wills in \"Bomb Power: The Modern Presidency and the
National Security State\" offers a forceful indictment of the 43rd
president, and even more of his vice president, Dick Cheney. [Wills\'
outrage is broad: torture, abuse of secrecy, illegal covert
operations,]{.underline} signing statements and (in Wills\' estimation)
unconstitutional expansion of the commander-in-chief power expressed in
Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution. We have come a
long way from the framers.

Clearly, something drastic has changed. [[Wills]{.mark}\']{.underline}
first goal here is to trumpet how far the modern presidency has departed
from the ideals of the fledgling republic, a \"violent break\" that
amounts to a \"quiet revolution.\" Wills does so by providing long
extracts of historical documents - principally the Constitution - and
demonstrating by apt placement of emphasis the documents\' intended
meaning. The result is deeply thought provoking.

His second [goal is to explain how we got here]{.underline}, as in the
book\'s first sentence: \"[This book [has a basic thesis]{.mark}, that
the Bomb altered our subsequent history]{.underline} down to its deepest
constitutional roots.\" He explains in the next paragraph that
[[today\'s abuses \"grew out of the Manhattan
Project]{.underline}]{.mark}, out of its product, and even more out of
its process. The project\'s secret work, secretly funded at the behest
of the President, was [[a model for]{.mark} the [covert activities
and]{.mark} overt [authority]{.mark} of the government [we now
experience]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" For the first half of this
impassioned book, Wills offers a condensed account of the development of
the atomic bomb in World War II and the rise of the \"national security
state\" under President Harry Truman. [He proposes that the first led to
the second]{.underline}.

[[This]{.mark} claim [is not persuasive]{.mark}]{.underline}, chiefly
[on logical grounds. [Wills suffers]{.mark}]{.underline} here [[from the
post hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy]{.mark}: Just [because A came before
B does not mean]{.mark} that [A caused B]{.mark}. Yes, [the]{.mark}
atomic [bomb preceded]{.mark}]{.underline} the developments that led to
the rise of [[expanded presidential]{.mark} intelligence and war
[powers, as well as]{.mark} to [excessive classification]{.mark} for
\"national security]{.underline},\" and the atomic bomb was indeed
invoked by people like Truman, his Secretary of State Dean Acheson and
their successors as justification.

[But [Wills\' own evidence shows]{.mark}]{.underline} that [the [desire
for an unfettered executive long preceded]{.mark} nuclear
[fission]{.mark}]{.underline}. Theodore Roosevelt issued more than a
thousand executive orders, unprecedented at the time, and Woodrow Wilson
tried to unilaterally make treaties. Plans to give the Air Force
autonomy had been under way since 1943, before anyone knew that nuclear
weapons were feasible. [[Bombs don\'t make strong presidents, people
do]{.mark}. The fact]{.underline} that long-standing [pressures to
expand the presidency succeeded after World War II does not mean that
the bomb generated the change]{.underline}.

Wills offers a concise tour through 25 actions, speeches and decisions
that clicked together with the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950
to form the national security state. \"The whole structure,\" Wills
tells us, \"is outside the Constitution.\"

[[Wills]{.underline}]{.mark} hits all the landmarks, but
[[leaves]{.underline}]{.mark} the reader with the impression that the
result was premeditated, leaving [[unmentioned all those decisions that
worked the other way]{.mark}: Truman\'s]{.underline} famously [minuscule
military budget]{.underline}, his [suspicion of intelligence
agencies]{.underline}, his early boycotting of the National Security
Council, and [the fact]{.underline} that [nuclear weapons production was
slowed after the war]{.underline} so that there were only seven nuclear
bombs in 1947 - hardly a stockpile. The upshot of a more nuanced history
would only help Wills to argue that these changes were not inevitable.

But the Bomb (always capitalized) only occupies the first half of the
book, after which Wills explores secrecy and the \"unitary executive\"
theory of untrammeled presidential power. The atomic bomb drops out
almost entirely as Wills documents presidential adventurism in toppling
foreign governments, bullying American citizens and centralizing control
of information. Every postwar president comes in for censure here, and
with reason. This is sobering reading, but this time [the fault is not
in the bomb, but in ourselves]{.underline}.

### Offense\-\--1AR

#### Congress would either [fail to act]{.underline} in a crisis or [build in exceptions]{.underline} to the CP that make it worthless 

Peter **Feaver 17**, professor of political science and public policy
and Bass Fellow at Duke University, and director of the Triangle

[[Why wouldn't legislative solutions work?]{.underline}]{.mark} And what
sort of unintended consequences are you worried about?

Peter Feaver

Well, [[I don\'t think you\'re going to pass a resolution that
requires]{.mark} the president to get [a vote from
Congress]{.mark}]{.underline}. First of all, [[I don\'t think Congress
is going to pass a law]{.mark} that would be [that
severe]{.mark}]{.underline}. Throughout the Cold War they never passed
that law, and I see no reason to think they would pass it today.

Second, [[there would be grave doubt whether Congress could act in times
of crisis]{.mark}. The [law would]{.mark} almost certainly [have
to]{.mark} be written so as to [leave substantial discretion]{.mark} up
[to the president. In times of crisis, this law doesn\'t apply.
In]{.mark} times of [urgency, this law doesn\'t
apply]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words, [[you are
reproducing]{.underline}]{.mark} some of [[the same discretion]{.mark}
and reliance on the good faith]{.underline} and professionalism [of the
people implementing it in order [for even that law to
work]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### The plan's perceived as the U.S. losing faith in deterrence\-\--emboldens adversaries

"Bad Idea: Putting Congress in the Chain of Command for Nuclear
Weapons,"
<https://defense360.csis.org/bad-idea-putting-congress-chain-command-nuclear-weapons/>

[[Nuclear policy is too important]{.underline}]{.mark} an issue [[to
legislate based on]{.mark} the [hypothetical thought processes of
individual actors]{.mark}]{.underline}. It becomes a greater issue when
[the [proposed solutions]{.mark} introduce measures that [will only
result in exacerbating]{.mark}]{.underline} already [[high
tensions]{.underline}]{.mark}. The debate over [[the "Restricting First
Use]{.underline}]{.mark} of Nuclear Weapons [[Act" will]{.mark} only
[add fuel]{.mark} to an already smoldering fire [by having a public
spectacle]{.mark}]{.underline} of [[over]{.mark} the [presidential
prerogative to utilize nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[Policymakers should consider how an adversary]{.underline}]{.mark}
[watching the public congressional proceedings [might
react]{.mark}]{.underline}. During the hearing, former Acting Under
Secretary for Policy at DoD Brian McKeon warned that [passing
[legislation that addresses hypothetical scenarios usually produces bad
law]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead of passing a bad law, the solution can
instead be found by reconfirming the existing power of the personnel in
the chain of command to refuse orders that are plainly illegal, without
having to exponentially add to the risks of miscalculation.

### AT: Political Will\-\--1AR

#### Congress doesn't care about nukes, they won't use authority effectively 

Jasmine **Farrier 14**, Professor of Political Science at the University
of Louisville, 2014, "THERMONUCLEAR MONARCHY: CHOOSING BETWEEN DEMOCRACY
AND DOOM," Law and Politics Book Review,
http://www.lpbr.net/2014/07/thermonuclear-monarchy-choosing-between.html

Books on US presidential war power are always topical, reflecting the
modern constitutional order. Although the War Powers Resolution was
passed in 1973 to increase congressional control over foreign policy,
Presidents have since initiated over 135 US military engagements abroad
(Grimmett 2012). This number does not include hundreds of drone strikes
in Yemen and Pakistan over the past decade, nor the armed advisors
President Barack Obama sent to Iraq this past June. The cold war-era
unilateral "Commander-in-Chief" narrative persisted after the collapse
of the Soviet Union and was reinvigorated after 9/11. Over the past
dozen years, [a combination of new and old legal [rationales for
executive power transcended partisan change in the White House and
continue]{.mark}]{.underline} today, [despite signals of presidential
war fatigue in public opinion and Congress]{.underline}. As he pivoted
from the threat of air strikes in Syria in 2013, President Obama still
insisted that he possessed a singular capacity to judge the national
interest abroad, and the constitutional power to act. But, he said, "I
believe our democracy is stronger when the President acts with the
support of Congress" (White House 2013). [For much of the past century,
presidents have treated congressional war powers as an institutional
courtesy at best (irrelevant annoyance at worst) rather than a
constitutional requirement. [No party in Congress]{.mark}]{.underline}
or ideological bent in the federal court [[has made a]{.mark} serious
[attempt to correct this]{.mark} view]{.underline}. The default
assumption of US foreign policy is the nuclear war model: the fate of
the world rests on a single person.

Elaine [[Scarry]{.mark} is deeply alarmed by these
developments]{.underline}. In THERMONUCLEAR MONARCHY: CHOOSING BETWEEN
DEMOCRACY AND DOOM, [she [argues]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[the]{.underline} means ([concentrated decision making) and]{.underline}
ends ([mass]{.underline} bodily [injury) of [nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark} cut the social contract]{.underline} to pieces [and
[undermine]{.mark} the constitutional principles of [s]{.mark}eparation
[o]{.mark}f [p]{.mark}owers]{.underline}, popular consent, and
deliberation. And she goes further to say [all this is true [even if
these weapons are never again used]{.mark}]{.underline}. She begins with
a quotation from President Nixon in 1974: "I can go into my office and
pick up the telephone and in 25 minutes 70 million people will be dead"
(p.14). [The goal]{.underline} of the book [is to convince
us]{.underline} that the boast itself -- certainly true, if unlikely to
be proven so -- demonstrates that [nuclear weapons are incompatible with
the virtues and structures of self-government]{.underline}. In addition
to tracing increases in presidential power, which have been widely noted
by historians and political scientists, Scarry offers new perspectives
on how Congress has allowed its war muscles to atrophy, as well as the
significance of shrinking public stakes in war decisions and execution.
\[\*343\]

Professor Scarry presents these arguments in a social theory framework
(she is the Cabot Professor of Aesthetics and General Theory of Value in
the Department of English at Harvard College). She weaves together a
variety of scholarly approaches in THERMONUCLEAR MONARCHY, including
ethics, history, law, linguistics, philosophy, and classics. Scarry does
not engage much contemporary political science literature on any of the
three branches, choosing instead to emphasize primary sources in the
institutional parts of the book, such as presidential and congressional
speech, legislative processes, and documents related to the US
Constitution's creation and ratification. Throughout, Scarry's writing
and argument style will be more familiar to readers with a background in
contemporary literary theory and other fields in the humanities. [The
book was not written to explain the technical side of nuclear
weapons]{.underline} development, nor the international treaties and
protocols that govern their existence today. Readers of this particular
review should also know that there is little discussion of case law
surrounding foreign policy and executive branch action (although she
cites Joseph Story's Commentaries on the Constitution several times).
But putting aside Professor Scarry's choices of emphasis and
presentation, her provocations are bracing and deserve attention from
scholars of political science and law, who rarely see normative
constitutional treatises of this book's ambition and scope (outside the
oeuvres of Bruce Ackerman, Louis Fisher, and Sanford Levinson, among a
few others).

Scarry presents her argument in three parts. The first will probably be
of greatest interest to those who study US constitutional and military
development. She says unequivocally that nuclear weapons are "outlawed"
by the Constitution in two ways: the declaration of war clause in
Article I, Section 8 and, more surprisingly, the 2nd Amendment. Scarry
describes these provisions as double-layered "distributional
requirements" (p.31), meaning the formal declaration of the House and
Senate needs more than a president's signature; legitimate war also
requires ratification by the people carrying arms into the field.

In Chapter 1, [[Scarry argues]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[nuclear
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} make legislative deliberation "ludicrous"
and thus "[infantilized" Congress]{.underline} over the past six
decades, [which she [ties to current]{.mark} lamentations of
[congressional dysfunction]{.mark}]{.underline} (pp.32-33). In addition
to the clear enumeration of Congress's power to declare war, which
should be neither appropriated nor delegated, Scarry explains why the
public deliberation that precedes a proper war declaration is edifying,
puts the members on the record, and broadens responsibility for the act.
In Chapter 2, she says the 2nd Amendment was designed to give
citizen-soldiers agency in battle. They can affirm, resist, or even
rebel against military and civilian leadership. She offers many examples
to show how desertion, mutiny, poor morale, and the abandonment of
conscription have influenced war outcomes in the US and around the
world. (These insights are certainly relevant to the lackluster
performance of the Iraqi army against Sunni militias in 2014, which has
led to calls for new US military support). While specialists may
disagree with her historical and legal analysis, Scarry's discussion of
the 2nd \[\*344\] Amendment as a "distribution of authorization over our
nation's arms" (p.98) is at least a refreshing diversion from
conventional gun rights debates. To her, the purpose of Article I,
Section 8 is the same as the 2nd Amendment: "consent processes will be
more rigorous, not less rigorous, in wartime" (p.136).

Part II focuses on the effects of nuclear weapons on the social
contract. Emphasizing classical and enlightenment philosophy, with a
special emphasis on the published work and correspondence of Thomas
Hobbes, she argues that above all else "the social contract is a
contract for peace" (p.155). In Chapter 3, Scarry argues that Hobbes
stressed a specific type of equality in the social contract: "equal
power to injure and be injured, regardless of apparent strength," (163)
which makes the concentration of nuclear weapons in just a handful of
countries especially dangerous, not to mention the constant dread of
non-state actors' obtaining the materials or hacking into weapons
systems. A general "aversion to war" and avoidance of bodily injury is
also central to the social contract theories of John Locke, Jean-Jacques
Rousseau, and Immanuel Kant (p.181). In Chapter 4, Scarry explains
further the "two-story" architecture of the social contract. Level one
is the "never-injure rule," except for self-defense. Level two is the
"release" from the first rule when the government is granted the power
to punish and make war because someone or a group has broken the
"never-injure rule" (p.189). The first level allows the government to
check the people, with the reverse true in level two. Then, in an
extended discussion on the development of judicial and parliamentary
processes (mostly in England), Scarry connects Parts I and II. She
argues that legislative assemblies were invented a thousand years ago
primarily to prevent or endorse executive war (p.203). In addition,
military observers from Homer to Abu Ghraib whistleblowers show how and
why it is also incumbent upon individual soldiers to assess the
legitimacy of war acts (pp.246-247).

In Part III, Scarry picks up a key theme from her own earlier work on
language, medicine, and the law to explain how nuclear weapons upset the
recognition of "the body as the ground of consent" (p.269). Continuing
an emphasis on Hobbes and Locke (the latter was also a physician), and
roaming through Benjamin Cardozo, John Rawls, and Michael Ignatieff,
among others, Scarry re-explores in Chapter 5 how the medical concept of
injury, and aversion to it, is at the heart of the governmental social
contract as well as consensual relations between individuals and groups.

Chapter 6 is titled "Thinking in an Emergency" and ties bodily consent
back to public deliberation. This chapter may hold special interest for
those who study the legal parameters of executive power in the US and
abroad. The 20th Century invention of "chronic emergency" has bled into
the 21st, even as presidential candidates of both parties rebuke
executive overreach (until they win the office). Torture, extrajudicial
executions, and other secretive facets of the "War on Terror" undermine
public deliberation when acting becomes more important than thinking.
Scarry explains that the question of whether we can remain coherent in
an emergency is as old as Aesop and Thucydides (pp.319-321). She then
turns to worldwide "habits in an emergency," ranging from the
development and re-assessment of \[\*345\] cardiopulmonary resuscitation
to medical mutual aid contracts and voluntary associations in Africa,
Canada, and Europe. The point of this section is to contrast these other
practiced communal arrangements for emergencies with the concentrated
processes of nuclear war, such as the well-known fact that the
"briefcase" (or "football") of nuclear launch codes must be near the
president at all times. She also lambasts Congress for helping to
reverse the "two part rule of an emergency -- act quickly if the goal is
to prevent injury; act slowly if the goal is to inflict injury" (p.374).
[Scarry is openly frustrated that today's Congress obstructs all manner
of domestic needs, but clears legislative barriers for war]{.underline}.

Though her jumping off points are different from contemporary political
science and legal scholarship, THERMONUCLEAR MONARCHY rings some
familiar alarm bells on presidential war. Criticism of executive
overreach on "emergency" and war powers target both the executive and
legislative branches (Adler and George 1996; Pfiffner 2008; Edelson
2013; Fisher 2013a, Zeisberg 2013, among many others). On the other side
are a variety of arguments that say, in effect, that presidents have a
legitimate obligation to punch out the walls of their authority when
they deem it necessary (Yoo 2010; Posner and Vermuele 2011; Howell et
al. 2013). Scarry's book is not organized to confront the legalese that
supports an "inherent/unified" theory of the presidency, but her
arguments still cut directly at its roots.

The Congress angle of Scarry's book will, unfortunately, get less
attention from scholars and practitioners. Conventional wisdom says
Washington is paralyzed from toxic partisan differences (Mann and
Ornstein 2013). [[There is less attention paid to]{.mark} the
[extraordinary consensus behind Congress's support of presidential
war]{.mark} under a variety of partisan landscapes and policy
environments]{.underline}. It is true that [[Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s and
Republicans subject opposition presidents to tongue lashings]{.mark} on
foreign policy, [but legislation]{.mark} to direct US foreign policy
[does not]{.mark}]{.underline} always [[follow]{.mark} the
[rhetoric]{.mark}]{.underline}. But [Congress's capacity to judge the
national interest is a]{.underline} complex and [open
question]{.underline}. Looking back at the 2002 floor debates on the
Authorization for the Use of Military Force against Iraq (Public Law
107-243), Representatives and Senators who voted against the bill (or
advocated a more diplomacy-centered alternative) were savaged, but many
of them made more accurate predictions of the war's trajectory than its
proponents. Without citing this point directly, THERMONUCLEAR MONARCHY
supplements a scholarly debate among those who see Congress flexing its
muscles before war (Howell and Pevehouse 2009), afterward in oversight
(Kriner 2013), or ambivalently, with cycles of delegation and regret
(Farrier 2010).

The judicial aspects of this book are likely to be the most intriguing,
but also frustrating, to law and courts scholars. Scarry says vaguely
that a legal case should be formulated "that shows how nuclear weapons
disenfranchise the entire population and thereby violate the Second
Amendment ... If the United States population comes to hold a strong
view on this matter, the court will eventually act" (p.87). If
[[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} and the public [[are not willing to pick
up]{.mark} their [constitutional tools]{.mark}]{.underline} "lying
unused on the ground" (p.404) to abolish nuclear weapons, and it is
unlikely that any \[\*346\] future president will pare back the
executive branch's national security infrastructure, can and should
courts fix these constitutional wrongs? Scarry hits a nerve here.

It is an underappreciated fact that federal court precedents on war
predate MARBURY V. MADISON and are usually more Congress-centered than
suggested by the oft-quoted dicta from US V. CURTISS-WRIGHT (1936)
(Glennon 1990; Silverstein 1997; Fisher 2005, 2013b). In the wake of the
bodily and institutional devastation wrought by the Vietnam War, some
were skeptical about whether the War Powers Resolution would be
sufficient to re-balance power without federal court support (Keynes
1982; Koh 1990; Ely 1993). Instead, federal courts built a wall of
justiciability barriers to punt foreign policy cases (such as Congress
members' lawsuits) back to the political process. Scarry does not
explain why courts would choose to take up cases on nuclear weapons when
they have spent decades developing strategies to avoid direct war powers
questions (as advocated by Bickel 1962 and Choper 1980). As recently as
2002, a federal district court dismissed a lawsuit against President
G.W. Bush for withdrawing unilaterally in December, 2001 from the thirty
year-old Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Russia (Adler 2004).

Here lies the central tension of THERMONUCLEAR MONARCHY. [[After a
scathing examination]{.mark} of inter-branch power
imbalance]{.underline}, Elaine [[Scarry]{.mark} still [places a lot of
faith in]{.mark}]{.underline} constitutions generally, and [[the]{.mark}
US [Constitution]{.mark}]{.underline} specifically, [to seek peace over
war]{.underline}. But [[if her main criticism]{.mark} of institutional
developments on nuclear weapons [is convincing, it seems a remote
hope]{.mark} that]{.underline} popular apathy, [[congressional
abdication]{.underline}]{.mark}, and court disinterest [[will]{.mark}
all [reverse]{.mark} to force the executive]{.underline} branch [into a
more modest institutional posture]{.underline}. Ironically, [the
[current poisonous political environment has given the president even
more cover to push unilateral]{.mark} executive [action on]{.mark}
domestic and foreign policy, including [nuclear weapons]{.mark}
reductions]{.underline}. In a speech in Prague early in his presidency,
and more recently in a State of the Union Address (White House 2009 and
2013), Obama did not say that his hands were tied by Congress on this
issue. Nor have executive branch officials pledged to the Senate that
they will go through formal treaty processes when negotiating with
Russia on nuclear reductions (Woolf 2014). A quick search on
https://beta.congress.gov/ for "nuclear weapons reduction" or
"abolition" shows only one bill that targets the US nuclear weapons
arsenal in the 113th Congress. H.R. 1650 was proposed by the at-large
Representative of Washington DC, Eleanor Holmes Norton, and died in
committee.

The separation of powers system was designed to inspire and sustain the
branches' different perspectives on the national interest through
(relative) electoral diversity and competition for power. Excessive
aggressiveness and delegation both undermine this carefully designed web
of institutional virtues that aim to balance deliberation with energy,
and majority rule with minority viewpoints (Tulis 1987). For example,
[congressional [critics of]{.mark} the [Obama]{.mark}
administration]{.underline} today [[look at Syria, Iraq]{.mark}, and
[elsewhere, and fault him for "taking a nap" through]{.mark} these
[crises]{.mark} while [offering few]{.mark} serious [specifics of their
own]{.mark}]{.underline} (Office of Speaker 2014). The Supreme Court
ruled recently against certain executive \[\*347\] orders and recess
appointments, but has little interest in taking up foreign and military
policy outside of detainees' constitutional rights. Elaine Scarry's book
is a call for the country to reject these habits and renew its original
constitutional vows. Even the most sympathetic readers will sigh at this
oddly hopeful ending.

### AT: Nuclear Authority Key\-\--1AR

#### Sole nuclear authority is a [consequence]{.underline} of an expanding national security state, [not the cause]{.underline}

Matt **Yglesias 11**, senior editor at the Center for American Progress
Action Fund, 2/7/11, "The Constitution in Danger,"
http://prospect.org/article/constitution-danger

In Bomb Power, the eminent intellectual Garry
[[Wills]{.underline}]{.mark} gives us an entertaining and informative
book whose self-proclaimed \"[basic thesis\" [is clearly mistaken. The
thesis is]{.mark}]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [the development of
[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s \"redefined the presidency]{.mark}
as]{.underline}, in all respects, [America\'s \'Commander in Chief\'\"
and \"altered our subsequent history down to its deepest constitutional
roots]{.underline}.\"

[[Instead]{.underline}]{.mark}, as the book\'s own brief history of the
Manhattan Project makes plain, [[nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline} (\"the Bomb\" as Wills puts it) [[are a
product of]{.mark} the [growth of a permanent]{.mark} national-[security
state and not its cause. Nor is there any mystery about why]{.mark} this
national-security state was created. [Objective facts of]{.mark} global
[power politics mandated]{.mark} the creation of [a mighty force to
defeat Germany]{.mark} and [Japan and]{.mark} to face down [the Soviet
Union]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Indeed, though the Bomb naturally starts at the foreground of Wills\'
narrative, it swiftly recedes to the background, and it is nearly
invisible by the close of the book, where [[Wills]{.underline}]{.mark}
laments that the \"vast and intricate structure\" built up during the
\"permanent emergency\" from World War II to the \"war on terror\" may
be impossible to dismantle. At various points he [[makes]{.mark}
sporadic, albeit [unconvincing, efforts to persuade us of the Bomb\'s
centrality. He argues]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example, that Woodrow
[[Wilson was unable to send troops]{.mark} to defend an ally
[without]{.mark} explicit [congressional
authorization]{.mark}]{.underline} \-- as Truman later did \-- [[because
Wilson \"did not have]{.mark} the [Bomb Power that made Truman able to
act]{.mark} in defiance of]{.underline} both [the]{.underline} United
States [Constitution]{.underline} and the United Nations Charter.\"

[The image of Wilson as]{.underline} strictly [constrained by the
constitutional order will amuse those of us who recall the Palmer Raids
and the imprisonment of Eugene Debs]{.underline}. And [[regarding
Truman]{.mark}, the [relevant Bomb Power was
Stalin\'s]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the time Wilson proposed the League
of Nations, people simply didn\'t believe the United States could face
pressing national-security threats from the other side of the ocean.
[[Hitler began to change minds]{.mark} on this score, and the [growth of
Soviet military power sealed the deal]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Nuclear authority was [not]{.underline} the root cause of executive secrecy\-\--their thesis [ignores]{.underline} historical contingency 

Timothy **Rutten 10**, LA Times writer for over 40 years, 1/20/10,
"\'Bomb Power\' by Garry Wills,"
http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/20/entertainment/la-et-rutten20-2010jan20

\"[[Bomb Power]{.underline}]{.mark},\" in other words,
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} an ambitious work, and while Wills is
incapable of being anything but provocative and erudite, his book is
thought-provoking but [[not]{.mark} entirely
[persuasive]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a one-time Jesuit seminarian,
[[Wills]{.underline}]{.mark}, now 75, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} a
reflexive Thomist: That has made him very [[discerning of first
causes]{.underline}]{.mark} and alive to the deeper meanings of texts,
like the Constitution.

[[It\'s not an outlook]{.underline}]{.mark}, though, [[that
copes]{.mark} well [with the reality of historical
contingency]{.mark}]{.underline} \-- and [that is where this book is
least satisfying]{.underline}. [We did not build the bomb on a strategic
whim: We built it because some of the world\'s best
physicists]{.underline}, including the instinctual pacifist Albert
Einstein, [told F]{.underline}ranklin [D]{.underline}.
[R]{.underline}oosevelt that [if we didn\'t, the Nazis would. The
Manhattan Project with]{.underline} all [its attendant secrecy was a
consequence of that reality]{.underline}.

And [yet, [Wills argues]{.mark}, \"only Congress can raise
money]{.underline}. It cannot give to another branch what the
Constitution limits to it. Executive actions that raise money apart from
Congress, that hide the money raised from Congress, that fail to report
all expended moneys to Congress, are all violations of the Constitution.
[The Manhattan Project was therefore a violation of the
Constitution]{.underline} \-- a thing perhaps understandable, or
forgivable, as a onetime emergency measure in war. But [as a standing
policy . . . this creates a steady erosion of the constitutional system.
[The]{.mark} National [Security State is in permanent constitutional
crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"

[Or [perhaps it\'s in]{.mark}]{.underline} a
[[permanent]{.underline}]{.mark} state of [[tension]{.underline}]{.mark}
\-- [[between]{.mark} its [republican ideals and the demands of a

Congress to Respond to Saudi Transgressions: Here's What Works according
to Former Senior U.S. Officials,"

**\*FMS = Foreign Military Sales**

It is important to separate option 1 (includes [[blocking]{.mark} future
[arm sales]{.mark}) and]{.underline} option 2 (includes suspending
maintenance and logistics for existing weapons systems), because the
latter may have more immediate effects on Saudi offensive military
operations in Yemen. In short, Riyadh would have no readily available
substitute for maintaining and servicing existing American weapons
systems. On Fox News Sunday, Senator Rand Paul said, "We have incredible
leverage. ... They can't last a couple of months without parts and
mechanics to help them run their air force." National Review's David
French wrote:

"American F-15s comprise close to half the Saudi fighter force, and the
Saudi variant of the F-15E Strike Eagle represents a substantial portion
of the air force's striking power....They can't just waltz over to a
different country and transform their armed forces --- not without
suffering enormous setbacks in readiness and effectiveness during a
years-long transition. A fundamental reality of arms deals is that a
major arms purchase essentially locks the purchasing nation in a
dependent posture for training, spare parts, and technical upgrades."

[Threatening support for Saudi Arabia's war machine can serve a variety
of purposes]{.underline}.

First, [such levers [present a]{.mark} potentially [significant stick
and carrot]{.mark}]{.underline} [for achieving policy goals that are
broader than the Yemen war]{.underline}. As Senator Macro Rubio stated
earlier this month on CNN's State of the Union, "[[Arm sales]{.mark} are
important,]{.underline} not because of the money, but [because it also
[provide]{.mark}s [leverage over]{.mark} their [future
behavior]{.mark}]{.underline}....[[They]{.mark} will [need]{.mark} our
[spare parts]{.mark}. [They]{.mark} will [need]{.mark} our
[training]{.mark}]{.underline}. [And those are things we can use to
influence their behavior]{.underline}."

Options 1-3 can also help curtail Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's
misadventures, if not his leadership of the Saudi government itself.
Bruce Riedel, who served as senior adviser on South Asia and the Middle
East to the last four presidents, explained in a recent essay,
"[Responsibility for the war is on [Mohammed bin Salman]{.mark}, who as
defense minister [has driven Riyadh into this]{.mark} quagmire. [Shaking
the arms relationship is]{.mark} by far [the most important way to clip
his wings]{.mark}]{.underline}." A former Obama official said as well,
"[[The message needs to be]{.mark} that [the relationship is being
frozen]{.mark} unless MBS moves aside. What Yemen and the Gulf crisis
and Khashoggi affair have clarified is that [MBS]{.mark} has allows
personal pique and vendettas to override any impulse to reform. He [has
made the region]{.mark} an even more [dangerous]{.mark} place,
[and]{.mark}, left to his own devices, [is]{.mark} very [likely to drag
us into regional conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. So I would pursue 4 and
2, with the former underscoring our message that MBS needs to step
aside, and the latter grounding their Air Force, to both add internal
pressure on MBS and to pressure the Saudis to negotiate a resolution to
Yemen."

[Options 1-3 can, indeed, serve purposes specific to the Yemen War,
including distancing the United States from support for Saudi crimes and
encouraging the Saudis and United Arab Emirates to finally bring the war
to a close through political negotiations]{.underline}.

In a New Yorker Radio Hour interview with David Remnick back in March,
Riedel explained, "[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is]{.mark} not
a direct party to the war, but we are [an enabler of]{.mark} the [war.
If the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [decided]{.mark} today that [it
was going to cut off supplies]{.mark}, spare parts, munitions,
intelligence,]{.underline} and everything else to the Royal Saudi
Airforce, [[it would be grounded tomorrow]{.underline}]{.mark}."

One former senior official suggested tying arm sales to different sets
of purposes, "I think [[Congress should pause all FMS and end]{.mark}
other [support]{.mark} to the Saudi campaign in Yemen]{.underline}.
Resumption of arms sales should be conditioned on Riyadh agreeing to a
fully transparent international investigation into the Khashoggi
incident, regular intelligence community assessments of Saudi efforts to
reduce civilian casualties in Yemen, and a report from the
administration outlining their strategy for addressing the humanitarian
crisis in Yemen and producing a peaceful settlement."

Nicole B. **Sedaca 18**, is a professor in the practice of international
relations at Georgetown University, 11/5/18, "The United States Should
Use Its Leverage Over Saudi Arabia,"
https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/11/05/the-united-states-should-use-its-leverage-over-saudi-arabia/

In the coming weeks, as more details about Khashoggi's killing emerge,
[[M]{.mark}ohammed [b]{.mark}in [S]{.mark}alman [will have to recover
from the]{.mark} significant [reputational blow]{.mark}]{.underline}
[that he and his country have taken]{.underline}. He will likely do so
by showing strength. This could take many forms. [[It is in the interest
of the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to make the case]{.mark} that [he
can achieve strength through]{.mark} real [political reform]{.mark}, as
opposed to crackdown]{.underline}. "[Encouraging public debate and
discussion by relaxing his grip on the country's media]{.underline}, as
well as releasing those jailed for expressing their views, [would prove
that he is indeed a true reformer]{.underline}," Khashoggi wrote.

[The U.S. [Congress]{.mark} has an important role to play in expanding
the conversation]{.underline} beyond Khashoggi's case. Numerous
legislators---including Sen. Marco Rubio and Reps. Mike Coffman, Adam
Smith, Eliot Engel, and Adam Schiff---have been outspoken in demanding
accountability for Khashoggi's death. Rep. Jim McGovern, along with a
[bipartisan group]{.underline} of 20 members of Congress, [has
[introduced legislation]{.mark} that seeks [to ban arms sales]{.mark}
and military aid to Saudi Arabia]{.underline} but ties this ban only to
the outcome of the investigation into Khashoggi's killing. [[These
efforts must extend to a broad range of]{.mark} Saudi [domestic
issues]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[including]{.mark} the [release of]{.mark}
all [political prisoners]{.mark} and journalists [and]{.mark} the
[lifting]{.mark} of [restrictions on the media and civic debate.
This]{.mark} would help [spur significant change]{.mark}]{.underline}
[that would serve both the Saudi people and the country's
economy.]{.underline}

[[In an ideal world]{.mark}, Mohammed bin Salman would open political
space]{.underline} [and stop persecuting journalists and activists
because of moral concerns]{.underline} and in order to meet
international standards, [and [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [would
make the case]{.mark} for these same reasons]{.underline}. But for
Trump, the pragmatic case for reform is more compelling. Regardless of
whether the White House and Congress are concerned about justice for
Khashoggi or the future of U.S.-Saudi relations, [[now is the time to
push]{.mark} Mohammed bin Salman to make meaningful
changes.]{.underline}

#### Circumvention\-\--Saudi can just give weapons to proxies in bad faith compliance with the CP\-\--that's Elbagir

#### The plan is key to global credibility for both advantages\-\--no risk of the net benefit 

Terrence **Guay 18**, Professor of International Business at
Pennsylvania State University, 10/19/18, "Arms sales to Saudi Arabia
give Trump all the leverage he needs in Khashoggi affair,"
http://theconversation.com/arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia-give-trump-all-the-leverage-he-needs-in-khashoggi-affair-104998

Last week, after the disappearance and apparent torture and murder of
Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, [[Trump argued]{.mark} that
"we would be punishing ourselves" by]{.underline} [[canceling arms
sales]{.mark} to Saudi Arabia]{.underline} [over a human rights
concern.]{.underline} Few world leaders, or former U.S. presidents,
would have been so bold as to publicly admit that a Saudi journalist's
life is not worth the loss of arms sales.

And it's true that the armaments relationship between these two
countries is long-established and lucrative for U.S. companies, as my
own research on the global defense industry shows.

However, [the president has it wrong when he argues the U.S. [would be
"foolish"]{.mark} to use these sales as]{.underline}
[leverage]{.underline} [with the Saudis,]{.underline} claiming they
could just get their tanks and fighter jets from other countries. [[In
fact it's]{.mark} one of [the best bargaining chips]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[he has]{.mark} with the kingdom.]{.underline}

An arms-buying behemoth

Saudi Arabia is indeed a major weapons buyer.

Saudi Arabia spent US\$69.4 billion on military expenditures in 2017,
according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the
world's leading research organization on conflict, armaments, arms
control and disarmament. Only the U.S. and China spent more.

But [since it doesn't have an arms industry]{.underline} -- like the
U.S. and China -- [[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [must import]{.mark} most of
that from other countries]{.underline}. That's why, over the past
decade, Saudi Arabia has imported more armaments than every country but
India.

And U.S. companies such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon have
benefited most from all that spending, making up the 55 percent of its
weapons imports from 2008 to 2017.

That has made Saudi Arabia the top buyer of American arms, with 11.8
percent of all sales over that period. In fact, U.S. defense contractors
have made almost \$90 billion selling arms to Saudi Arabia since 1950.

In recent years, fighter planes like the F-15 and their spare parts have
become particularly important to the weapons trade with Saudi Arabia
because it needs them to conduct its bombing campaigns in Yemen.

For example, a 2011 contract awarded \$30 billion to U.S. defense
contractors to produce 84 F-15 jets and other weaponry for the Saudi
military. Boeing stands to earn \$24 billion of this total, which the
company claimed will support over 50,000 U.S. jobs.

A bargain over human rights

As president, Trump clearly hopes that the money continues to pour in
and helps him with his "America First" campaign, intended to create jobs
for Americans.

It's no surprise, then, that he made his first foreign trip as president
to Saudi Arabia in May 2017. During the trip, he reportedly struck a
bargain with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman: Trump wouldn't
lecture his kingdom on human rights, and Saudi Arabia would buy more
American weapons.

Unfortunately, [Trump's claim to have secured \$110 billion in arms
sales has not materialized]{.underline}. Although the Saudis signed
numerous letters of intent and interest, some of which had been approved
by the Obama administration, no new contracts have resulted, due mainly
to lower oil prices and the Saudis' costly war in Yemen.

So [in the Khashoggi affair, it appears that Trump is eager to keep to
his end of the bargain.]{.underline} He has avoided criticizing the
Saudi government over its alleged role in Khashoggi's disappearance to
curry favor with the monarchy over arms sales. Even in the face of
Turkish reports that Saudi agents tortured Khashoggi and dismembered his
body and U.S. intelligence supporting those allegations, Trump has
preferred to blame "rogue killers" for any crime.

In defending this course of action, [[Trump claimed]{.mark} that "if
they don't buy \[weapons\] from us, [they're going to]{.mark} buy it
[from Russia or]{.mark} they're going to buy it from
[China]{.mark}]{.underline} or they're going to buy it from other
countries."

US leverage

While it's true that Russia and China are indeed major exporters of
armaments, the claim that U.S. weapons can easily be replaced by other
suppliers is not -- at least not in the short term.

First, [[once a country is "locked in"]{.mark} to a specific kind of
weapons system,]{.underline} such as planes, tanks or naval vessels,
[the [cost to switch]{.mark} to a different supplier [can be
huge]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Military personnel must be retrained on new
equipment, spare parts need to be replaced, and operational
changes]{.underline} [may be necessary.]{.underline}

[After being so reliant on U.S. weapons systems for decades, the
transition costs to buy from another country could be]{.underline}
[[prohibitive even for oil-rich Saudi Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The second problem with Trump's argument is that [armaments from Russia,
China or elsewhere are simply not as sophisticated as U.S.
weapons]{.underline}, which is why they are usually cheaper -- though
the quality gap is quickly decreasing. To maintain its military
superiority in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia has opted to purchase
virtually all of its weapons from American and European companies.

[[That is why the U.S.]{.mark} has [significant
leverage]{.mark}]{.underline} [in this aspect of the relationship. [Any
Saudi threat to retaliate]{.mark} against a ban on U.S. arms sales by
buying weapons]{.underline} from countries that have not raised concerns
about the Khashoggi disappearance [[would not be credible]{.underline}.
[And is]{.underline}]{.mark} [probably [why]{.mark}]{.underline},
despite worries in the White House, [such [a threat has not]{.mark} yet
[been made]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Selling ideals for short-term gains

[[Since]{.mark} the end of [World War II, the U.S.]{.mark} has
[developed a]{.mark}]{.underline} [[global reputation as a moral
authority]{.underline}]{.mark} [championing human rights]{.underline}.

Yes, there have been many times when realpolitik took priority.

But despite these moments, [the U.S. managed also to maintain its
authority by advocating respect for human rights as a global
norm]{.underline} during the Cold War, and within many repressive
regimes ever since.

With Khashoggi, [[Trump is choosing to give up that mantle
completely]{.underline}]{.mark} [by [showing his priority is]{.mark}
purely [economic, regardless of]{.mark} the [impact on]{.mark} the
United States' [global reputation]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Such [a
bald-faced strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}, in my view, [[sells American
values short and weakens U.S.]{.mark} global
[credibility]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Embargo Key\-\--1AR

#### **Clean break from military support is the only way to solve\-\--our evidence is comparative to the CP**

Ryan **Goodman 18**, editor of Just Security, 10/22/18, "Options for
Congress to Respond to Saudi Transgressions: Here's What Works according
to Former Senior U.S. Officials,"
https://www.justsecurity.org/61172/effective-ineffective-congressional-responses-saudi-arabia-arm-sales-sanctions-khashoggi/

[Another]{.underline} former [senior official supported a clean
break]{.underline} [from U.S. support for the Yemen war rather than a
piecemeal approach]{.underline}. "[On Yemen, [the best move would
be]{.mark}]{.underline} to support the Khanna-Murphy War Powers
resolution. [[A clean end to]{.mark} US [military support for
the]{.mark} Saudi-UAE [war]{.mark}]{.underline} in Yemen is [[better
than]{.mark} more [targeted efforts to police]{.mark} that
support]{.underline} (like the bar on in-flight refueling). [Suspending
existing DCS licenses and placing limits on future foreign military
[sales]{.mark} for things like air-to-ground strike capabilities would
be a natural supplement to this approach]{.underline}," the former
official said.

Jeffrey Prescott, who served as Special Assistant to the President and
Senior Director for Iran, Iraq, Syria, and the Gulf States on the
National Security Council and now a strategic consultant to the Penn
Biden Center expressed a similar perspective, "My view is that [the
callous murder of Mr. [Khashoggi]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [[and]{.mark}
the [Trump]{.mark} administration's clear impulse to sweep it under the
rug]{.underline} --- [[demonstrate]{.mark}s how far the relationship
with Saudi Arabia has gotten off track, and [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[need for serious consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}. As a start[, we
could use this moment to extricate ourselves from military involvement
in the disastrous war]{.underline} in Yemen, [a step that is long
overdue]{.underline}. Ideally [we would simultaneously help push for a
diplomatic resolution of the conflict]{.underline} -- necessary, not
easy, and very unlikely given how little effort the Trump administration
has put into serious diplomacy. But [[washing our hands of
involvement]{.mark} in the war, [even in the absence of a]{.mark} US
[diplomatic push, will]{.mark} still]{.underline} [put [pressure]{.mark}
on [UAE and Saudi to end the conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Professor Mohamad Bazzi, who is writing a book on proxy wars between
Saudi Arabia and Iran, had a similar assessment of the effectiveness of
suspending US military support as a means to effectuate a resolution to
the conflict. Bazzi told me, "Together, [actions]{.underline} 1, 2, and
3 (likely in that order of effectiveness) would go significantly beyond
the Obama administration's freeze on the sale of precision-guided
munitions to Riyadh in late 2016. [[They would signal]{.mark} to the
Saudis and Emiratis that [US]{.mark} military [assistance will]{.mark}
now [truly become contingent on]{.mark} progress in [political
negotiations]{.mark}]{.underline}. I suspect [[that's the only
way]{.underline} [Saudi and UAE leaders can be convinced to pursue a
political settlement]{.underline}]{.mark}, which the Trump
administration agrees (at least rhetorically) is [the path to ending
this war]{.underline}."

#### Embargo key\-\--US weapons will end up with Saudi proxies and only the plan builds in time to provide Yemen relief

Jennifer **Spindel 19**, assistant professor of international security
at the University of Oklahoma, and the Associate Director of the Cyber
Governance and Policy Center, 5/14/19, "THE CASE FOR SUSPENDING AMERICAN
ARMS SALES TO SAUDI ARABIA,"
https://warontherocks.com/2019/05/the-case-for-suspending-american-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia/

[Beyond signaling, we know [U.S. arms]{.mark} sales often [end up in the
wrong hands]{.mark}, and have been used [in Yemen]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[The]{.mark} Saudi-led [war]{.mark} in Yemen [has led to
starvation]{.mark} conditions]{.underline}, [caused thousands of
civilian [casualties, and]{.mark} has led to the [displacement]{.mark}
of millions of people. The United Nations]{.underline} [estimates that
[80 percent of Yemen's population]{.mark}]{.underline} -- 24 million
people -- [[require]{.mark} some form of [humanitarian or protection
assistance]{.mark}, and that the severity of the situation is
increasing]{.underline}. Would an arms embargo create meaningful change
in Yemen?

[[An]{.mark} initial [effect of an embargo is]{.mark} that
[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [would have to]{.mark}]{.underline} [[work harder
to access war materiel]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Jonathan Caverley noted,
[more than 60 percent of Saudi Arabia's arms delivered in the past five
years came from the United States]{.underline}. [Even if this percentage
decreases over time,]{.underline} [[it will be costly for Saudi]{.mark}
Arabia [to transition]{.mark}]{.underline} [to a primarily Russian- or
Chinese-supplied military. Though Saudi Arabia might be willing to
pay]{.underline} this cost, [it would still have to pay, [and
take]{.mark} the [time]{.mark} to transition]{.underline} [to its new
weapons systems. [This would represent a]{.mark} brief [break in
hostilities that could facilitate]{.mark} the [delivery of aid and
assistance in Yemen]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### AT: Sanctions Plank

#### Saudi Arabia is too large to isolate with sanctions\-\--the US would back down or only target small players

Jarrett **Blanc 18**, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, the State Department coordinator for Iran nuclear
implementation under President Obama, 10/19/18, "How to Punish Saudi
Arabia,"
https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/10/19/khashoggi-saudi-arabia-sanctions-221668

[Khashoggi's murder demands a meaningful response from the United
States]{.underline}. Washington has a responsibility to stand up for
U.S. residents---Khashoggi, a longtime journalist, was living in
Virginia---and an interest in standing up for the free press. [But
[sanctions are]{.mark} a [lazy and inadequate]{.mark}
answer]{.underline}. Instead, [[the U.S. needs to distance itself
from]{.mark} reckless [Saudi policies]{.mark}. Trump has tools to do so.
If he does not use them, it's time for Congress to step up]{.underline}.

[Talk about sanctioning Saudi Arabia is focused on the Global Magnitsky
Act]{.underline}, legislation that authorizes sanctions targeting
individuals responsible for gross human rights abuses. In part, that is
because the Trump administration has shown little appetite to hold
autocrats to account, while Congress has a role in Magnitsky sanctions.
Congress cannot force the executive to impose sanctions, but can
embarrass it for choosing not to.

[The focus on Magnitsky is also an implicit acknowledgment that other
broader sectoral or [national sanctions are ill-suited]{.mark} to
confronting Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. Saudis close to the government
have threatened that oil production could be withheld in response to
U.S. sanctions, leading to a price spike. This threat is easy to
exaggerate. Saudi Arabia could drive up prices, but in the long term,
the Saudis themselves would suffer most from wild fluctuations. Still,
[[Saudi Arabia is]{.mark} much more [integrated]{.mark} in [and
important to the world's economy]{.mark} than previous targets of
broad-based sanctions like Iran, Cuba, Myanmar or even
Russia]{.underline}. [[Trying to isolate them would be difficult and
ineffective]{.underline}]{.mark}, even if the Saudi oil weapon isn't
much of a threat.

[Neither Magnitsky sanctions nor broader economic sanctions are likely
to be effective tools]{.underline} to change Saudi policies. If
[[Magnitsky sanctions are used to target small fish]{.mark} like the
suspects in the murder]{.underline} or a carefully selected official
scapegoat, the [sanctions may feel righteous, but they will achieve
little]{.underline}. [The House of Saud has plenty of ways to motivate
its servants]{.underline}. Magnitsky sanctions could instead target the
senior-most officials, perhaps even the crown prince himself, making
them feel even more righteous, but as with national or sectoral
sanctions, [[Saudi Arabia is just too big]{.mark} to be isolated this
way]{.underline}. Also, like Russian oligarchs recently targeted for
U.S. sanctions, [Saudi [leaders own]{.mark} such [vast portfolios
of]{.mark} international [assets]{.mark} that [even targeted sanctions
are]{.mark} likely to have [difficult]{.mark}-to-predict economic
consequences.]{.underline} If the latest example of Russia sanctions
causing disruption in the global market for aluminum are precedent,
[[the U.S. will]{.underline}]{.mark} (and probably should) [[back down
rather than]{.mark} [suffer the consequences of sanctioning]{.mark}
Saudi oligarchs [without a clear understanding of]{.mark} [their impact
on the]{.mark} global [economy]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### AT End Use Monitoring 

#### End use monitoring fails---ensures US weapons end up in the wrong hands

Trevor **Thrall et al 18**, a senior fellow for the Cato's Institute's
Defense and Foreign Policy Department, 3/13/18, "Risky Business: The
Role of Arms Sales in U.S. Foreign Policy,"
https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#full

Dispersion. [The United States uses a number of procedures to try to
ensure that the weapons it sells actually go to authorized customers and
to monitor the end use of the weapons so that they do not wind up being
used for nefarious purposes]{.underline}. The Department of State even
compiles a list of banned countries, brokers, and customers. But most of
these tools have proved ineffectual.86

[Programs like Blue Lantern and Golden Sentry aim to shed light on the
service life of American weapons sold abroad through end-use
monitoring]{.underline}.87 [[While]{.mark} the description of U.S[.
end-use monitoring]{.mark} ("pre-license, post-license/pre-shipment, and
post-shipment") [sounds comprehensive, it's actually anything
but]{.mark}.]{.underline} In fiscal year 2016, the agency in charge of
approving and monitoring arms sales, the Directorate of Defense Trade
Controls (DDTC), authorized 38,398 export-license applications --- down
more than 50 percent from 2012 after the government shifted some weapons
to the Department of Commerce's purview.88 [[To oversee more than 35,000
export licenses]{.mark} annually, [the DDTC has a full-time staff of
only 171]{.mark} people. [The Blue Lantern program is]{.mark} executed
by embassy staff in recipient countries but [administered back]{.mark}
in Washington [by]{.mark} only [nine]{.mark} State Department [employees
and three contractors]{.mark}]{.underline}.89 [[Twelve people]{.mark}
[can't possibly track everything that happens to]{.mark} billions of
dollars' worth of [advanced weaponry]{.mark} transferred to dozens of
countries abroad each year.]{.underline}

[Nor is the process designed to correct problems. On one hand, end-use
violations can result in individuals and companies being prevented from
making future purchases. On the other hand, [there is no evidence that
end-use monitoring has changed the pattern of American arms
sales]{.mark} in any way[. The United States]{.mark} in truth
[has]{.mark} little or [no control over what happens to the
weapons]{.mark} it sells to other nations. [The result is that]{.mark}
year after year [weapons]{.mark} of all kinds [end up falling into the
hands of unreliable]{.mark}, risky, [or]{.mark} just plain [bad
actors]{.mark}, at which point they're used in ways neither the United
States nor its customers intended]{.underline}. [American weapons have
frequently wound up being used against Americans in combat. And even
more often, [local and regional actors]{.mark}, including criminal
gangs, [have employed them in their own conflicts]{.mark}. In civil
wars, regime collapse, or other extreme cases, [factions steal weapons
and use them for their own purposes, as ISIS did]{.mark} in
Iraq]{.underline}.90

[Iraq, as previously noted, provides an excellent case study in the
inability of the United States to prevent dispersion. As part of U.S.
efforts to rebuild Iraq's military and security capabilities after the
2003 invasion, the United States sent Iraq roughly \$2.5 billion worth
of American weapons]{.underline} through 2014, including everything from
small arms to "armored personnel carriers, military helicopters,
transport aircraft, anti-tank missiles, tanks, artillery and drones." 91

[Despite the presence of thousands of U.S. troops in-country and the
very close relationship between those troops and their Iraqi
counterparts, many of those weapons went missing. Between 2003 and 2008
alone, 360,000 out of 1 million small arms disappeared, along with 2,300
Humvees. A sizable chunk of this weaponry would later end up in the
hands of ISIS. The Iraqi army, trained and equipped by the American
military, dissolved when faced by ISIS and left their weapons behind for
the terrorist group to pick up and use for conquering and holding
territory]{.underline}. A UN Security Council report found that in June
2014 alone "ISIS seized sufficient Iraqi government stocks from the
provinces of Anbar and Salah al-Din to arm and equip more than three
Iraqi conventional army divisions."[92 Data collected by Conflict
Armament Research in July and August of 2014 showed that 20 percent of
ISIS's ammunition was manufactured in the United States --- likely
seized from Iraqi military stocks]{.underline}.93 [In short, [dispersion
enabled the spread of ISIS and]{.mark} dramatically r[aised the
costs]{.mark} and dangers [of confronting the group on the
battlefield.]{.mark}]{.underline}

https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/how-the-mysteries-of-khashoggis-murder-have-rocked-the-us-saudi-partnership/2019/03/29/cf060472-50af-11e9-a3f7-78b7525a8d5f_story.html?utm_term=.c5eb9c433b40

[It has been nearly six months since Jamal Khashoggi was brutally
murdered inside Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul, but the
aftershocks continue. [The U.S.-Saudi]{.mark} defense and intelligence
[partnership has been rocked]{.mark}. The future of the relationship is
on hold, pending answers from Riyadh.]{.underline}

Saudi Arabia still hasn't explained officially how and why the Post
Global Opinions columnist was killed. But Saudi and American sources
have begun disclosing new information about the people and events
surrounding Khashoggi's fatal visit to Istanbul. They've described
secret intelligence deals that are now frozen. And they've explained, in
the clearest detail yet, how an operation that began as a kidnapping
ended with a gasping, dying Khashoggi pleading: "I can't breathe."

The basic questions remain much the same as they did in October, when
Khashoggi died: How was the Istanbul strike team that carried out the
operation trained and controlled? What exact roles did Saudi Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his close aides play in the killing? What
new controls can be implemented, in Riyadh and Washington, to make sure
that such a grisly murder of a journalist never happens again?

And most important, will anyone be held accountable?

Saudi Arabia's initial lies about the killing collapsed soon after
Khashoggi disappeared on Oct. 2. But [[MBS,]{.mark} as the crown prince
is known, [still hasn't taken responsibility]{.mark} for the killers'
actions, which were done on his behalf and perhaps his orders. [Until he
provides]{.mark} real [answers, the U.S.-Saudi military]{.mark} and
intelligence [partnership]{.mark}, important for both countries'
security, [is]{.mark} likely to remain in [limbo.]{.mark}]{.underline}

This case is personal for us at The Post. Khashoggi was our colleague,
and my friend for 15 years. To understand how his gruesome murder
happened and whether it's possible to rebuild the U.S.-Saudi
relationship, I've interviewed more than a dozen knowledgeable American
and Saudi sources, who revealed some previously secret details because
they hope to establish new rules and accountability that might preserve
the relationship. The sources requested anonymity because of the
sensitivity of the information.

[The bottom line is that unless the crown prince takes ownership of this
issue and accepts blame for murderous deeds done in his name, his
relationship with the United States will remain broken. Saudi officials
claim that MBS has made changes, firing Saud al-Qahtani, his former
covert-operations coordinator. But [the Saudi machine]{.mark} of
repression [remains intact]{.mark}, run by many of the same people who
worked for Qahtani. U.S. officials worry that the young crown prince has
become a Saudi version of Saddam Hussein, an authoritarian
"modernizer."]{.underline}

MBS took a small step toward placating critics Thursday when the kingdom
announced it had freed three female human rights activists from prison
while they await trial. Ten other women who campaigned for women to
drive and on other issues remain in detention.

Prince Khalid bin Salman, a younger brother of the crown prince, former
ambassador to Washington and now vice defense minister, discussed
Saudi-American relations in an interview in Washington on Thursday. He
said he hoped that despite intense criticism in Congress of Saudi Arabia
in the wake of Khashoggi's murder, the partnership can be repaired: "The
relationship did not start in one day, and it will not end in one day."

The Saudi official met Thursday with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
[The Trump administration wants to maintain good relations with the
Saudis but faces]{.underline} some [strong congressional
resistance.]{.underline}

"The Saudis have internalized the idea that this will not blow over,"
says Bernard Haykel, a Princeton professor who knows MBS well. "[They
want to make good with Congress, but they don't know how."]{.underline}

Dangerous tools

The Khashoggi story is a lesson in how U.S.-supported intelligence and
special-operations capabilities can be misused by other countries.
That's the starkest conclusion that emerged from this reporting. Among
these previously undisclosed findings:

●[Some members of the Saudi Rapid Intervention Group that was sent to
Istanbul received training in the United States, according to U.S. and
Saudi sources. The CIA has cautioned other government agencies that some
of this special-operations training might have been conducted by Tier 1
Group, an Arkansas-based company, under a State Department license. [The
training]{.mark} occurred [before the Khashoggi incident]{.mark}, as
part of ongoing liaison with the Saudis, and it [hasn't been
resumed.]{.mark}]{.underline}

●[[A U.S. plan to train and modernize]{.mark} the [Saudi intelligence
service is also on hold]{.mark}, pending State Department approval of a
license. This project was developed by Culpeper National Security
Solutions, a unit of DynCorp, with help from some prominent former CIA
officials. No work on the project has been done.]{.underline}

●One of the Saudi contacts involved in planning the Culpeper training
project was Maj. Gen. Ahmed al-Assiri, the Saudi deputy chief of
intelligence, who Saudi officials say is under investigation because of
his alleged involvement in the Istanbul operation.

●[Michael Morell, former acting director of the CIA, was publicly
identified as Culpeper's chairman of the board in 2017, but he no longer
holds that position, according to a source familiar with the company. A
second source said Morell withdrew from the project within days of
Khashoggi's murder because of his concern about the direction Saudi
Arabia was heading.]{.underline} Morell declined to comment.

Tier 1 Group and DynCorp are both owned by affiliates of Cerberus
Capital Management, a privately owned investment group based in New
York. The company wouldn't confirm or deny whether any of the 17
perpetrators of the Khashoggi killing who were sanctioned by the
Treasury Department had been trained under the Tier 1 contract. But a
source close to Cerberus said, "We know that this horrendous incident
occurred" and that "companies must emphasize rigorous ethical evaluation
policies" in light of such an event.

●Stephen Feinberg, the co-chief executive of Cerberus, is also chairman
of the President's Intelligence Advisory Board, which provides
independent counsel on intelligence matters. When he was appointed,
critics argued there might be conflicts of interest. The source familiar
with Cerberus's business activities said that when Feinberg assumed the
PIAB post, he divested his interest in all companies in the Cerberus
portfolio that were involved in defense and intelligence matters,
including Tier 1 Group and DynCorp. The divestment occurred before
Khashoggi's death and was unrelated, the source close to the company
said. A Cerberus spokesman declined a request for comment by Feinberg.

●[[NSO Grou]{.mark}p, an Israeli-founded company that provides
sophisticated tools for hacking mobile phones, has reviewed and modified
its relationship with Saudi Arabia, according to a Saudi
source]{.underline}. The company, which was recently acquired by a
London-based private equity firm called Novalpina Capital LLP, concluded
after an internal review that its surveillance technology didn't
directly contribute to tracking Khashoggi on his way to his death. But
[the company [has frozen new requests from the kingdom]{.mark},
according to the Saudi source, because of concerns that its technology
might have been misused]{.underline}. The company declined to discuss
any specific clients and wouldn't confirm or deny this account.

[As [these corporate examples illustrate, the murder]{.mark} of a Post
columnist [has affected the contour of the U.S.-Saudi
relationship]{.mark}]{.underline}. This partnership has been beneficial
for both countries' security, and it's especially important now, at a
time when the Trump administration is challenging Iranian meddling in
the region. But [many current and former U.S. officials believe that
without clearer rules and accountability, [the partnership might be
unsustainable, given vocal opposition from]{.mark} many members of
[Congress.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Birth of a strike team

Understanding how the murder in Istanbul happened begins with MBS and
Qahtani, his Iago-like adviser. Starting in 2015, when King Salman took
the throne and a few months later installed his son Mohammed in the
royal succession, Qahtani began using the royal court to suppress
dissent. His base of operations was the Center for Studies and Media
Affairs, but behind this bland-sounding front, Qahtani began assembling
a team drawn from the Saudi intelligence services and military. And he
began purchasing surveillance tools from NSO and other vendors.

MBS's surveillance dragnet allowed him to spy on other key officials in
the kingdom. Starting in late 2015 or early 2016, he obtained permission
from Mohammed bin Nayef, then crown prince and interior minister, to
conduct "lawful intercepts" of communications through the royal court,
according to U.S. and Saudi sources. The subsequent wiretaps, through
various hidden channels, included Mohammed bin Nayef himself, his key
intelligence counselor Saad al-Jabri, and the heads of the foreign
intelligence and domestic security agencies, according to U.S. and Saudi
sources.

Because Qahtani specialized in social media campaigns against critics of
MBS, his targets became increasingly tilted toward political dissidents
and journalists such as Khashoggi. By 2017, Qahtani had drawn up a list
of more than two dozen names, including Khashoggi, of people who might
be subject to arrest or detention, according to a Saudi who has seen the
list. Only four of the names could be described as serious "enemy
combatants," the source said.

Qahtani developed special-operations capabilities at the center. Several
key operatives later became members of the Rapid Intervention Group sent
to Istanbul to kidnap or kill Khashoggi. The biographies of three
alleged team members sanctioned by the Treasury Department illustrate
how the group came together.

The Istanbul team's alleged leader was Maher Mutreb, a colonel in the
Saudi intelligence service and member of a wealthy and respected Saudi
family. A Saudi source said he had served in London from 2002 to 2007 as
deputy chief of station. He was an early expert in cyberintelligence,
and he would sometimes give advice to Saudi friends who worked at the
embassy about computer security and how to avoid hackers, a Saudi source
said. When Mutreb returned to the kingdom around 2007, the intelligence
service regularly sent him abroad, to the United States and elsewhere,
for further training.

Mutreb mentioned to Saudi friends that he had gone to several training
programs in the United States over the past decade, the Saudi source
said.

Mutreb may have been chosen to lead the team because he had been
friendly with Khashoggi when they were both living in London and working
for then-ambassador Prince Turki al-Faisal. According to a Saudi source
who knew Mutreb in London, the intelligence officer would sometimes join
Khashoggi and other Saudis working at the London embassy for Friday
prayers and then tea afterward in Mayfair.

Mutreb was drawn into Qahtani's circle when he was invited to join the
Saudi Federation for Cybersecurity, said the Saudi source, citing
contacts inside the royal court. A fluent English speaker, Mutreb
traveled with MBS on his trips to the United States in 2017 and 2018.
With his intelligence and cyber skills, he was tapped in 2017 as
assistant secretary general for security at Qahtani's center, according
to U.S. and Saudi sources.

The arc of Mutreb's career, from respected foreign intelligence officer
to alleged member of a kidnapping and murder team, illustrates how Saudi
intelligence was bent by MBS and Qahtani to their purposes.

Another senior member of the team, also reportedly a colonel in Saudi
intelligence, helped direct special activities for Qahtani's center,
possibly including the arrest and interrogation of detainees, a U.S.
source said. Saudi detainee cases at this time included the female
activists and other dissidents. This colonel helped make secret
preparations for the November 2017 arrest of about 200 prominent Saudis
and their detention at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh, the U.S. source
added.

A third operative sent to Istanbul was Thaar Ghaleb Alharbi, a
lieutenant in the royal guards according to the New York Times and other
news reports. He became a favorite of MBS after he fatally shot a Saudi
named Mansour al-Amri who tried to storm the gate at Al-Salam Palace in
Jiddah in October 2017, according to U.S. and Saudi sources. Alharbi
helped in managing detainees and other operations, said a U.S. source
familiar with the royal court's activities.

One macabre detail of the interrogations, according to U.S. and Saudi
sources, was that detainees were forced to sign nondisclosure agreements
pledging that if they talked about their imprisonment and interrogation,
they would bear "full responsibility" for the consequences. A European
source described Alharbi as a "very close ally" of MBS because of his
work on sensitive security matters; that might have made him a natural
selection for the Istanbul team.

The members of the Istanbul team were the field operatives, not the
deciders. "These are people who serve their country, and when they're
asked to do something, they do it," said one Saudi official.

Grisly new details

What happened inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul remains murky, even
six months later, because the Saudis haven't yet made a full disclosure
of the events.

A Saudi source says that the royal court had been tipped off by a
security officer stationed at the consulate that Khashoggi would be
there on Oct. 2 to complete some paperwork required before his planned
marriage to his Turkish fiancee, Hatice Cengiz. The Rapid Intervention
Group was assembled. The royal court advised the consulate, via a
foreign ministry cable, to cooperate with the team when it arrived.

The best account of Khashoggi's murder seems to come via a bug planted
in the consulate by Turkish intelligence. A Saudi who has carefully read
a transcript of an audio recording of that illegal surveillance
described its contents. He said it indicates the team planned to kidnap
Khashoggi and bring him back home for detention and interrogation ---
but that the plan was botched and Khashoggi was killed. His body was
then dismembered and disposed of.

The tape transcript, as described by the Saudi source, is chilling.
Mutreb tells Khashoggi: "You're coming back with us." Khashoggi
protests, "No! I have people outside waiting for me," meaning Cengiz.
Mutreb insists: "You're coming!" Khashoggi screams as he is grabbed, the
Saudi source said.

What happened next remains conjecture. The Saudi source says there is a
note in the transcript that says Khashoggi was given an injection, which
apparently was deduced from the audio. The Saudi source said the shot
was probably a powerful sedative, administered by Salah Tubaigy, a
medical specialist from the Saudi Interior Ministry who was allegedly
part of the team. The Saudis have used sedatives on other captives in
previous attempted renditions, the source said.

A bag was then placed over Khashoggi's head, and he screamed: "I can't
breathe. I have asthma. Don't do this." He died soon after --- possibly
from a sedative overdose, choking or asphyxiation. After his death, the
transcript describes a buzzing noise, perhaps from an electric saw as
his body is cut into pieces. This grisly task was apparently overseen by
Tubaigy, according to the Saudi who read the transcript.

The clearest evidence that the kidnapping, at least, was a premeditated
crime is that the Saudi team included a man named Mustafa Almadani. He
was a general in Saudi intelligence and older than other members of the
Istanbul team, according to passport records. His build was similar to
Khashoggi's, and he could wear his clothes and impersonate him after the
operation was concluded.

After Khashoggi's death, a look-alike, probably Almadani, left the
consulate by the back door, avoiding Cengiz. His presence strongly
suggests that the operation, whatever its purpose, was carefully
planned, U.S. and Saudi sources agree.

MBS under pressure

[After the initial coverup failed, the Saudi public prosecutor charged
11 people in Khashoggi's murder and requested the death penalty for five
of them. Qahtani was not one of the 11, according to Saudi and American
sources. The Saudis haven't disclosed the names of those
charged.]{.underline}

[Pompeo told MBS last year to take responsibility for the events by
closing Qahtani's center and putting him under house arrest, a U.S.
official said. But neither happened, initially]{.underline}. I reported
in January that Qahtani was continuing to give orders to his former
staff members and that he remained in contact with the crown prince.

Qahtani's Center for Studies and Media Affairs has been supplemented by
a new Center for Communication and Knowledge Foresight and put under the
control of Nasir al-Biqami, who also runs a counterterrorism center at
the royal court known as Etidal, according to U.S. and Saudi sources.

But [[the dissident-monitoring activities of the old center
continue]{.mark}, minus the kidnapping and special
operations]{.underline}, these sources noted. They said that [many of
Qahtani's former deputies still target MBS's critics on social media.
Holdovers from his old team include the chief of staff, who was
Qahtani's former secretary; the head of planning and development, who
was formerly chief of special cyber operations; the operations chief,
who was former head of cybersecurity; and the chief of analysis and
training, who previously was chief of target acquisition in the
special-operations wing.]{.underline}

[Despite reports that Qahtani is under house arrest, two Saudis told me
he is probably still communicating with his former aides.]{.underline}
"If you're in his position, you would want to make sure you don't lose
everything," said one Saudi official who knows Qahtani well. He cited a
Saudi proverb: " 'When a camel falls, it draws more knives than when it
was standing.' Everyone wants to show that the camel is still standing."

A slippery slope

[The dilemma [for U.S. defense and intelligence contractors]{.mark} is
that [it will be difficult for them to do new business]{.mark} with
Saudi Arabia until MBS takes responsibility for the Khashoggi killing
and demonstrates, through specific reforms, that such a crime won't be
repeated. Until that occurs, Saudi Arabia will face limits from the
State Department and Congress.]{.underline}

[U.S. companies that want to sell technology or services to Saudi Arabia
or other foreign nations face a complicated, little-known vetting
process]{.underline}. This applies both to direct
government-to-government deals, known as "foreign military sales," and
private contracts referred to as "direct commercial sales." Both
categories are licensed by the State Department's Directorate of Defense
Trade Controls, which is part of the Bureau of Political-Military
Affairs. The State Department's decisions are then reviewed by the House
and Senate foreign affairs committees.

[This [licensing pathway was]{.mark} effectively [blocked for Saudi
Arabia after Khashoggi's murder]{.mark}, because of the concerns about
the kingdom's respect for human rights. The licensing request by
DynCorp's Culpeper unit has been halted, for example, according to a
source close to the company, even though the kingdom's notoriously
disorganized intelligence service badly needs training.]{.underline}

["Stagnation of this effort to modernize Saudi intelligence is not good
for all of us," one Saudi official told me. That may be true, but
[Congress isn't likely to approve]{.mark} the [training without]{.mark}
real signs of [reform.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 1AR\-\-- Relations Weak Now

#### Report of new ballistic missile facility causing more fissures in the relationship

Natasha **Turak 19**, CNBC Correspondent, 2/1/19, "Alleged Saudi
ballistic missile base signals greater divergence from Washington,"
https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/01/middle-east-arms-race-fears-spike-over-alleged-saudi-arabia-missiles.html

[[Satellite imagery reportedly revealing a ballistic missile
facility]{.mark} deep in the Saudi desert [spotlights Riyadh's increased
investment in]{.mark} its [independent warfighting]{.mark}
capabilities]{.underline}, U.S. defense experts say.

[This, they believe, indicates a growing desire by the longtime ally to
be able to take offensive measures without the approval of its main
weapons sponsors in Washington.]{.underline}

"There's an arms race underway," Michael Rubin, a former Pentagon
official and Arab affairs expert at the American Enterprise Institute,
told CNBC. "Whiplash policy changes in Washington have had their impact
on Riyadh: Saudi authorities are no longer going to be constrained by
White House whispers. The Saudis are demonstrating that they can take
matters into their own hands."

Images analyzed by missile defense experts at the Middlebury Institute
of International Studies in Monterey, California, and first reported by
The Washington Post, appear to show the testing and possible
manufacturing of ballistic missiles. These can carry nuclear warheads to
targets thousands of miles from their launch point. International powers
have sanctioned Iran for its own frequent testing of the weapons.

ONE TIME USE: Saudi missile base

As America's top weapons buyer and foremost security partner in the Arab
world, one might question why Riyadh would need to invest in its own
ballistic missile facility. It already has a fleet of top-of-the-line
F-15 fighter jets, Tornados and Typhoons, giving it an airpower
advantage over regional arch-rival Iran, the majority of whose air force
hasn't been updated since the 1970s.

The catch is that Saudi Arabia's air force still needs maintenance and
logistics support from the jets' countries of origin --- the U.S. and
the U.K. --- and that support could be terminated if the aircraft is
used in an unapproved manner. Homegrown missiles, meanwhile, have no
such limit. Furthermore, missiles don't need pilots who require training
and risk being shot down and captured by the enemy.

Chinese assistance?

[[Riyadh has long operated its missile program outside the realm of
U.S.]{.mark} [approval]{.mark} and without U.S. assistance, starting
with its small purchase of Chinese D3-F Silkworm ballistic missiles in
1988. The program is overseen by the kingdom's secretive Strategic
Rocket Forces (SRF), which unlike other military branches, reportedly do
not mix with American advisors.]{.underline}

One former Pentagon official, who requested to remain anonymous due to
the sensitivity of the topic, told CNBC that [the SRF likely "operates
with Chinese input," adding that "given that Pakistan has close ties
with both China and with the Kingdom and has numerous advisors working
with Saudi security agencies, I wouldn't be surprised if there were some
Pakistani assistance as well."]{.underline}

[If true, the links illustrate a longtime Saudi strategy of diversifying
its diplomatic and security alliances and highlight a potential shift
eastward. Weapons purchases from China, though a tiny fraction of those
from the U.S., now feature armed drones --- something the U.S. currently
won't sell to the Saudis.]{.underline} And American arms dealers have
voiced alarm over Riyadh's expressed interest in purchasing Russia's
flagship S-400 missile defense system, a cheaper alternative to the
U.S.-made THAAD system.

China's Ministry of Defense, its foreign ministry and embassy in Riyadh
did not immediately respond when asked for comment by CNBC. Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying responded to the Associated
Press last week, saying: "I have never heard of such a thing as China
helping Saudi Arabia to build a missile base." Pakistan's Ministry of
Defense, its foreign ministry and its Saudi embassy also did not
immediately respond when contacted by CNBC.

Countering Iran is 'common sense'

And at a time when Iran, which the U.S. and Saudi Arabia designate the
world's top state sponsor of terror, has increasingly sophisticated
ballistic missile capability thanks to Russia, the investment is "common
sense," some experts say.

"If the Saudis are developing an indigenous ballistic missile capacity,
part of the blame for this should be placed on the JCPOA (Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action) with Iran," David DesRoches, an associate
professor of security studies at the National Defense University in
Washington D.C., told CNBC, referencing the multilateral 2015 deal that
lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits to its nuclear program.

In doing this, DesRoches argues, "the West in effect gave Iran
absolution for its missile program ... Given the plethora of missiles in
the Iranian inventory, it is not unlikely that the kingdom sought to
match its rival."

It underscores a willingness to ignore Washington's interests and
policies from the beginning of (Crown Prince's Mohammed bin Salman's)
rise to power.

Bruce Riedel

FORMER CIA OFFICER AND GULF AFFAIRS EXPERT

The kingdom has long asserted its right to self defense, particularly at
a time when it's been subject to missile and other projectile fire from
Houthi rebels in neighboring Yemen, where it's led a bloody offensive
since 2015. Weapons experts have confirmed that the missiles fired at
Riyadh, Medina and other cities from Yemen in recent years are of
Iranian origin.

'I can't confirm or deny'

In an interview with CNBC's Hadley Gamble in Riyadh on Monday, Saudi
Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih refrained from acknowledging the missile
base, but argued that his country should be able to defend itself.

"I really don't have any information one way or another, so I can't
confirm or deny," Al-Falih said in response to a question about the
base. "But I would say that Saudi Arabia is today a receiver,
unfortunately, of a barrage of ballistic missiles that are being
launched at civilian installations ... the kingdom needs to look after
its own defense, our own interest."

The Saudis are also pursuing a nuclear energy program they say will be
strictly peaceful. But the plan has faced pushback by many in Congress,
particularly following Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's statement last
March that "without a doubt if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will
follow suit as soon as possible."

In a report published by the AP last week, missile expert Jeffrey Lewis
noted the frequent link between missile development and the pursuit of
nuclear weapons, telling the news agency, "I would be a little worried
that we're underestimating the Saudis' ambitions here."

'The US underestimates Saudi Arabia'

[Foreign policy analysts note that [this development could further
complicate relations between the U.S. and the Saudis, given the already
increased anger]{.mark} of many lawmakers [over]{.mark} Riyadh's
activities in [Yemen and the]{.mark} murder of Saudi journalist Jamal
[Khashoggi]{.mark} last fall, which has been blamed on Saudi government
operatives.]{.underline} But they also warn that any sanctions would
likely accelerate the kingdom's shift eastward.

One of the many former U.S. government officials wary of Saudi
intentions is Bruce Riedel, a 30-year CIA veteran and expert on Gulf
affairs.

"The timing of the construction suggests that Mohammed bin Salman and
his father (King Salman) embarked on building this facility very early
after he took charge of the Defense Ministry," he told CNBC in an email
Wednesday. "[[It underscores a willingness to ignore Washington's
interests]{.mark} and policies from the beginning of his rise to
power]{.underline}."

#### The relationship is failing---MBS policies putting the US at a huge disadvantage and giving nothing in return 

Aaron **Miller 18**, vice president for new initiatives and a
distinguished fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center, 11/13/18, "The
US-Saudi relationship: Much less than meets the eye,"
[[https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/13/opinions/us-saudi-relationship-less-than-meets-the-eye-miller-sokolsky/index.html]{.underline}](https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/13/opinions/us-saudi-relationship-less-than-meets-the-eye-miller-sokolsky/index.html)

[Among the most magical urban myths floating around the Trump
administration is that [Saudi Arabia]{.mark} is America\'s strategic
partner and the relationship is simply too big to fail. Sadly, that
[relationship is already failing.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Indeed, under the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (also
known as [MBS]{.mark}), Saudi Arabia [has willfully pursued policies
that have undermined]{.mark} both [American interests]{.mark} and
values]{.underline}. Worse still, the Trump administration envisions a
role for Saudi Arabia in its Middle East strategy that can only
disappoint.

In recent weeks, Turkish authorities have accused the Saudi regime of
responsibility for the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal
Khashoggi inside Saudi Arabia\'s consulate in Istanbul. The Saudi
government has blamed rogue operatives for the killing and dismissed a
number of high-ranking officials.

There\'s no doubt that Saudi Arabia is important to the United States.
Preserving global access to its oil, avoiding the chaos that would be
unleashed if the kingdom collapsed or became a failed state, and
cooperation on counter-terrorism are clearly core US interests.

But to concede these interests doesn\'t mean Saudi Arabia is a reliable
security partner of the United States or that Riyadh is America\'s
strategic ally. Saudi Arabia is in fact a repressive police state that
has long exported a strain of Islam supportive of Islamic jihadi
terrorist activity and that ideologically has been hostile to America,
the West, Jews and Christians.

[[MBS has]{.mark} made an effort to restrain religious extremism. But
he\'s also [launched a major crackdown to concentrate absolute
power]{.mark}, repress civil society and journalists and jail or
intimidate his opponents.]{.underline}

[As for promoting US interests, the past year and a half reads like a
DIY manual in undermining them. [The detention of the Lebanese
P]{.mark}rime [M]{.mark}inister, in an apparent bid to force his
resignation, [has]{.mark} only [strengthened Hezbollah]{.mark}. Bin
Salman\'s disastrous [boycott of Qatar made it more difficult]{.mark}
for the Gulf Cooperation Council [to stand up to Iran]{.mark} and has
driven Doha and Tehran closer together, and his failed military campaign
in [Yemen has created instability,]{.mark} polarized the region and
expanded rather than contracted Iranian influence ([and given ISIS more
room to maneuver]{.mark}).]{.underline}

[Saudi Arabia has proven to be too weak and incompetent to be a bulwark
against Iran; on the contrary, it has been an enabler of Tehran\'s
influence.]{.underline}

The Trump administration, and especially the President, have argued that
punishing Saudi Arabia for the killing of Khashoggi would jeopardize the
much ballyhooed \$110 billion arms sales package that was announced last
year in Riyadh. This is baloney. Of this amount, the Washington Post
reported, there were many suggestions of intent to purchase weapons and
\"six specific items, adding up to \$28 billion, \[of which\] \... all
had been previously notified to Congress by the Obama administration.\"

[The rest comprise a Saudi pipe dream of future purchases, not signed
contracts, most of which are unlikely to reach fruition because of Saudi
budgetary pressures. Moreover, in the unlikely event that the Saudis put
their money where their mouth is, Trump\'s claims that it would produce
500,000 to one million jobs in the American defense industry are \"fake
facts.\"]{.underline}

[The real facts are: 1) the [Saudis need US weapons]{.mark} and
equipment [more than we need to sell them]{.mark}, in part because they
demonstrate the US security commitment to the kingdom; and 2) [it would
be]{.mark} very [difficult]{.mark} and expensive [for the Saudis to make
good on their]{.mark} periodic [threats to \"buy foreign]{.mark}\" if
they can\'t get what they want from the United States.]{.underline}

Then there\'s the much trumpeted claim the Saudis are always there when
you need them on oil prices. There are many examples of the Saudis
bucking US interests when it came to oil supply, including its
leadership of the 1973 Arab oil boycott, its expansion of output to
drive down prices in an effort to hurt the US oil fracking industry, and
its decision this week to reduce supplies to drive prices up.

[It remains to be seen whether, on another occasion, the Saudis would
move to increase supplies in the wake of a very tight market. If they
did so, it would be a calculation driven by a Saudi-first, not an
America-first, oil policy.]{.underline}

[Finally, there\'s the administration\'s conviction that the Saudis are
integral to achieving Israeli-Palestinian peace. [There\'s no doubt that
MBS has warmed up to the Israelis]{.mark}, largely because of their
common interest in checking Iran and Sunni jihadists. [But]{.mark}
direct and [under-the-table contacts are a far cry from]{.mark} open
meetings or [support for a US peace plan]{.mark} that on issues like
Jerusalem and borders violates the Arab consensus and could hand Iran
and Sunni Muslims a propaganda windfall if the plan is too aligned with
the needs of the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.]{.underline}

### 1AR\-\--Khashoggi

#### Khashoggi's murder was a [watershed]{.underline} moment\-\--relations won't recover

Emma **Ashford** 10/22/**18**, a Research Fellow in Foreign Policy
Studies at the Cato Institute, \"The U.S.-Saudi Alliance Was in Trouble
Long Before Jamal Khashoggi's Death\", CATO Institute,
https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/us-saudi-alliance-was-trouble-long-jamal-khashoggis-death

[The murder of Jamal Khashoggi]{.underline} inside the Saudi consulate
in Istanbul has [left Washington reeling]{.underline} --- and Riyadh
bewildered. Whether [Saudi leaders]{.underline} didn't expect to get
caught, or simply believed themselves above reproach, they [appear to
have been taken by surprise at the outpouring of criticism.]{.underline}

Indeed, [[Khashoggi's death]{.mark} feels like [a watershed moment in
the U.S.-Saudi relationship]{.mark}. Suddenly, [many in
Washington]{.mark} are [finally]{.mark} willing to [admit]{.mark} that
[Saudi Arabia]{.mark} --- a country they have long treated as a friend
and partner --- [is]{.mark} little more than [a]{.mark}nother
[murderous]{.mark} Middle East [dictatorship. The White House may still
be supportive, but newspapers are printing criticism, think tanks are
returning Saudi money, and Congress is]{.mark} actively [considering
sanctions.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[This moment has been a long time coming. Khashoggi's murder caps years
of growing dissatisfaction]{.mark} about the Saudi alliance. [Like a
failing marriage, the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and Saudi Arabia
have]{.mark} long [been drifting apart. Diverging]{.mark} U.S.-Saudi
[interests, and]{.mark} an increasingly [reckless Saudi foreign policy
have taken their toll on the relationship]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
even as domestic repression has grown inside Saudi Arabia. As [Sen.
Chris Murphy noted]{.underline} in a recent op-ed:

[When I came to Congress a little more than 10 years ago, support for
Saudi Arabia was broad and bipartisan. But now... more and more of us
are wondering whether our ally's actions are in our own best
interests.]{.underline}

Indeed, while some argue that the problem with the U.S.-Saudi
relationship is a conflict between American interests and values, [it's
no longer clear that American interests are well-served by a close
relationship with the Saudis]{.underline}. If policymakers follow
through, the dissident's death could provide the opportunity to ---
finally --- distance the United States from its toxic Saudi ally.

#### Khashoggi killing and congressional backlash have caused an unprecedented disruption in the relationship

says there's 'unprecedented disruption' in US-Saudi relationship,"
https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/417856-middle-east-expert-says-theres-unprecedented-disruption-in-us-saudi

[[There's an "unprecedented disruption" in U.S.-Saudi relations
following the death of]{.mark} journalist Jamal
[Khashoggi]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [according to Middle East
scholar Hussein Ibish.]{.underline}

[Ibish, a senior resident scholar at the The Arab Gulf States
Institute]{.underline}, told Hill.TV on Wednesday that [even though
President Trump has doubled down on his defense of Saudi Arabia,
Congress could put sanctions on a number of Saudi officials, including
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.]{.underline}

But the scholar thinks that [[even without]{.mark} the [sanctions, the
current situation makes it nearly impossible for the crown prince
to]{.mark} visit Washington and [have a direct relationship with the
Trump administration.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"Congress could place sanctions on Saudi Arabia in general and even more
on specific Saudi officials, potentially including the crown prince and
others that would limit American contact with them, limit their ability
to operate in the U.S., and I think [even now under the current
circumstances, it would be practically impossible for the crown prince
of Saudi Arabia --- he\'s not the de facto ruler but he\'s the day-today
executive authority --- to come here]{.underline}," Ibish told co-host
Buck Sexton on "Rising."

### N/UQ -- Relations Low -- Laundry List

#### Relations will tank inevitably

**Stratfor** 3/15/**19**, \"Why the U.S. and Saudi Arabia Are Destined
to Diverge\", Oil & Gas 360,
https://www.oilandgas360.com/why-the-u-s-and-saudi-arabia-are-destined-to-diverge/

President Donald Trump's current enthusiasm for Saudi Arabia
notwithstanding, [[the relationship]{.mark} between the United States
and perhaps its most important ally in the Middle East [is
undergoing]{.mark} a significant [transformation]{.mark}. U.S. political
pressure on Saudi Arabia is rising, led by a growing congressional
discomfort over]{.underline} the Saudi-led intervention in [[Yemen
and]{.underline}]{.mark} the circumstances surrounding the murder of
journalist Jamal [[Khashoggi]{.mark}, but that [is]{.mark} just [the tip
of the iceberg]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Beneath the surface of the politics of the day, a pair of more
significant geopolitical shifts is helping pull the longtime allies
apart: the evolution of the global system away from U.S. dominance
toward an intensifying, near-peer competition with China, as well as the
fundamental reshaping of the global oil and gas markets upon which Saudi
Arabia has built its wealth and power. As both countries adjust to these
changing dynamics, [their]{.mark} shared strategic [relationship will
evolve away from]{.mark} the foundation of [oil,
counterterror]{.mark}ism [and]{.mark} the mutual desire to contain
[Iran]{.mark}. It's likely that]{.underline}, as those changes play out,
[the countries' future priorities will not align as they have in past
decades.]{.underline}

A Relationship Built on Pragmatism

Despite their obvious differences, Saudi Arabia and the United States
have maintained a nearly eight-decade friendship. From the beginning,
the U.S.-Saudi relationship has rested on mutual needs, not necessarily
shared values. A meeting in the waning weeks of World War II aboard the
USS Quincy between U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and King
Abdulaziz (better known in the West as Ibn Saud) set the stage for their
countries' close ties. The stark contrast between the lands that they
governed could not have been more apparent. Roosevelt, arguably the
leader of the world's most powerful and industrially advanced country,
had just attended the Yalta Conference, where he helped decide the
postwar future of the globe. King Abdulaziz, on the other hand, came
from one of the least developed countries in the Middle East, its oil
industry still in its infancy.

Almost three-quarters of a century later, the countries' differences
remain just as stark. The United States, which touts one of the world's
most liberal economies, is a democracy that prides itself on religious
and cultural tolerance. On the other hand, Saudi Arabia, a state that
derives legitimacy from a religious foundation, is one of the world's
last remaining absolute monarchies with little space for political
opposition. Although Saudi Arabia has worked to shed its image of
intolerance, there's only so much it can do. Unlike U.S. relationships
with allies that possess a shared set of values, such as Canada and the
United Kingdom, Saudi-U.S. ties are based on pragmatism at their core.
Although they share interests in certain areas, significant
disagreements on others will remain.

History has borne this out.

At the time of the USS Quincy meeting, Saudi Arabia had been looking to
establish a close alliance with an outside patron capable of pushing
back against colonial interests in the Middle East. The United Kingdom,
which controlled most of the surrounding Middle Eastern territory,
certainly eyed the monarchy's newfound oil reserves. The United States,
meanwhile, also wanted access to Saudi Arabia's oil but had little
desire to forge a colonial empire. This drove the two together, as did
mutual opposition to the rise of communism, which threatened the
legitimacy of the monarchy. But their relationship over the next three
decades was not without its complications. As far as Saudi Arabia was
concerned, the United States would not drop its support for Israel and
would not budge far enough on the Palestine issue, eventually leading to
two oil embargoes.

The fall of the shah of Iran in 1979 pushed their relationship in a
different direction. This time, the United States and Sunni-dominated
Saudi Arabia found themselves on the same side of the issue --- with the
Shiite-led Islamic Republic of Iran on the other. The Americans and the
Saudis still were fighting communists, as their cooperation against the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan evidenced, although once the Soviet Union
collapsed, so did the battle against communism as a unifying priority.
Just a few years after the Cold War ended, however, another common foe
emerged: Iraq's Saddam Hussein. The Gulf War and subsequent U.S. dual
containment policy targeting both Iraq and Iran in the 1990s brought the
United States and Saudi Arabia closer together. But other events over
the years have also pushed them apart. The Iran-Contra affair
complicated the relationship in the 1980s, while the rise of the global
jihadist movement emanating from the Wahhabism sect, which is closely
identified with Saudi Arabia, added another wrinkle, particularly after
9/11.

For most of their history as allies, Saudi Arabia has needed the United
States more than vice versa. From the beginning, King Abdulaziz needed
the United States to provide a counterweight to the United Kingdom.
Later, the United States provided a powerful buttress girding the
monarchy against populist movements, including communism. Today, Saudi
Arabia counts on Washington to support its struggle against Iran and
help it battle transnational militant groups. At every step, Saudi
Arabia has had to appeal to the United States by proving its utility to
Washington.

A World that is Shaken, not Stirred

[Two significant geopolitical shifts are altering the fundamental way
that Saudi Arabia and the United States interact: the dramatic
transformation in global energy markets and the rise of
China]{.underline}, which is reducing the dominance of the U.S.-led
Western order that emerged after the Cold War.

[[The shale revolution]{.mark} in the United States [is]{.mark} driving
U.S. crude oil [production to record levels]{.mark} --- more than 12
million barrels per day (bpd) --- far eclipsing the 5 million bpd it
produced just a decade ago. Rystad Energy projects that by 2025, [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [will]{.mark} become a net exporter of
crude, with production of about 16 million bpd. And 2018 marked the
first time in three decades that the United States [import]{.mark}ed
[less]{.mark} than 1 million bpd from Saudi Arabia.]{.underline}

Unsurprisingly, the astronomical rise in U.S. oil production has caused
major ripples in global oil markets, contributing to the glut that
caused oil prices to plummet below \$100 a barrel in 2014. Riyadh's
desire to balance the increasing U.S. supplies has prompted it to lead
the effort by OPEC and other major producers to trim production ---
something that has driven Saudi Arabia closer to Russia. The close
cooperation that both countries must achieve in order to micromanage oil
markets is driving their political cooperation on other levels as well.

[[As the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates' [thirst]{.mark} for its oil
[decreases, Saudi Arabia]{.mark} has [pivoted]{.mark} more forcefully
[to Asia]{.mark} to find alternative markets]{.underline}. Increasing
Chinese consumption and falling production make it an attractive
substitute. Thus, China, along with the rest of Asia, represents Saudi
Arabia's oil market of the future. And as with Russia, the growing
economic interdependence is driving political cooperation at the highest
level between Riyadh and Beijing.

To be clear, even though U.S. dependence on oil from Saudi Arabia and
the Middle East has fallen, that does not mean that it is losing
significant interest in maintaining stable energy production in the
region. Any crisis in the Middle East that would reverberate through the
global economy would bring the United States -- which is deeply tied to
the global financial system -- down with it. [Beyond 2030, however, even
this could shift as [alternative energy]{.mark} sources, electric
vehicles and battery technology continue to [alter]{.mark} the structure
of [energy geopolitics]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Toward a Multipolar World

[After the Cold War ended, the United States was left standing as the
global system's dominant power. But [with China's emergence]{.mark},
that is evolving into a more multipolar structure, and [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has, naturally, [refocused]{.mark} its
[attention]{.mark} on countering its rising rival. This includes not
only economic competition]{.underline} -- as the trade war represents --
[but also shifting its security posture away from places like the Middle
East to free resources to manage the burgeoning great power
competition.]{.underline}

In fact, it is [this shift in focus]{.underline}, especially the U.S.
overtures to Iran under President Barack Obama, that [concerns the
Saudis the most]{.underline}. For Obama, striking the nuclear deal with
Iran meant reducing the risk that yet another Middle Eastern conflict
would draw in the United States. But for Saudi Arabia, the deal meant
losing its close U.S. support in its campaign against its regional
nemesis. With a new administration in the White House came a shift in
U.S. attitude back toward more hostile relations with the Islamic
republic. [Over the next two decades, however, the prospect of at least
a partial normalization with Iran will present a tantalizing option for
U.S. presidents as national priorities continue to change.]{.underline}

[The new normal of relations with the United States will present a
difficult adjustment for most regional powers like Saudi Arabia. Absent
an emerging need, Riyadh may find itself filling a lesser role in the
grand U.S. strategy than it has for nearly a century. Saudi Arabia's
increasing economic interconnectivity with China and Russia may also
mean that soon, for the first time since that initial meeting between
FDR and King Abdulaziz, the kingdom may find itself dropping down the
list of U.S. strategic partners.]{.underline}

A Relationship that Bends but not Breaks

[Even if Saudi importance in the eyes of the United States declines,
their relationship would not necessarily reach a breaking point, but it
would certainly become more volatile. Status as a less important partner
would mean that the amount of political capital a U.S. president would
be willing to invest in Saudi Arabia will decline, both domestically and
internationally.]{.underline}

But [perhaps the biggest consequence for Saudi Arabia over the next two
decades will be the likely inevitability that [Tehran and Washington
will one day reach]{.mark} some form of [understanding]{.mark}. A
strategic reversal on Iran would make sense for the United States on
several levels as the global picture changes. For one, Iran would be
more inclined to cooperate with the United States and India in South and
Central Asia, particularly as Pakistan and China's cooperation on the
China-Pakistan Economic Corridor deepens. In the short term, progress on
the U.S.-Iran relationship is likely to be minimal, but significant
[generational shifts]{.mark} in both countries [will bring]{.mark} to
power additional political leaders whose views are not as colored by the
immediate events surrounding the Islamic Revolution and subsequent
U.S.-Iran hostage crisis. U.S. [detente]{.mark} with Iran would allow
Tehran to consolidate the regional gains it has made in places like
Iraq, meaning that the competition between Iran and Saudi Arabia for
regional hegemony would likely increase.]{.underline}

#### And nuclear ambitions

**Stratfor** 3/15/**19**, \"Why the U.S. and Saudi Arabia Are Destined
to Diverge\", Oil & Gas 360,
https://www.oilandgas360.com/why-the-u-s-and-saudi-arabia-are-destined-to-diverge/

[[Another key area]{.mark} to monitor will be how [Saudi Arabia]{.mark}
moves forward with its [nuclear]{.mark} energy [ambitions]{.mark}. It
has been negotiating with the United States, China, Russia and others
over the construction of nuclear power plants in the country. But the
kingdom has demanded that much of the fuel enrichment and reprocessing
cycle remain under its control, an idea that [has not sat well with
Washington]{.mark} over concerns that it could allow Riyadh to develop
nuclear weapons. But if the United States is unwilling to budge on its
position, Saudi [leaders will]{.mark} certainly [consider a deal with
China or Russia]{.mark}, which may not adhere to the same
standards.]{.underline}

[The kingdom's [human rights]{.mark} record is also likely to increase
the distance between Saudi Arabia and the West]{.underline}. The outcry
against the Saudi war in Yemen and Khashoggi has been growing in the
U.S. Congress. But no real change in Saudi behavior can be expected as
long as oil prices remain low and the kingdom continues to struggle to
implement long-term economic reform under Saudi Vision 2030. That means
that [[as the]{.mark} U.S. [need for a close relationship]{.mark} with
Saudi Arabia [declines, Washington's responses]{.mark} to such issues
[are likely to become increasingly harsh]{.mark}.]{.underline}

While [[the]{.mark} Saudi-U.S. [relationship]{.mark}]{.underline} is not
destined to crash, it [[will grow]{.mark} increasingly [rocky]{.mark}
over the next two decades as the imperatives that brought them together
continue to change]{.underline}. The countries will continue to
cooperate on key issues, especially if resurgent transnational terrorist
groups like Islamic State or al Qaeda target the West, again derailing
the U.S. pivot to Asia. But in the end, the Saudi-U.S. relationship will
always be defined by mutual interests, not mutual values. That means
that [as the global system evolves to a place in which neither needs as
much from the other, their [friendship is unlikely to be]{.mark} as
[steadfast.]{.mark}]{.underline}

## AT Iran Impacts

### 2AC\-\-- Iran Turn

#### Iran's role in Yemen exaggerated, arms sales to Saudi Arabia incentivize Iran to become more involved 

Farea **Al- Muslimi 17**, Contributor for the Century Foundation,
5/19/17, "Iran's Role in Yemen Exaggerated, but Destructive,"
https://tcf.org/content/report/irans-role-yemen-exaggerated-destructive/?session=1

[[One of the main U.S. justifications for arming]{.mark} and supporting
the [Saudi]{.mark} war in Yemen [is the claim that the
Houthis]{.mark}---a Yemeni Zaydi Shia-led rebel group---[are Iranian
proxies]{.mark}, seeking to overthrow the government of Yemen and bring
it under Iranian influence.]{.underline} The Houthis and Iran, on the
other hand, deny a close relationship and downplay the levels of support
the rebels receive from Tehran.

[As a matter of fact]{.underline}, however, both sides are
incorrect---and [the truth is somewhere in the middle]{.underline}.
[[The Houthis didn't emerge due to Iranian support]{.mark}, even if they
got it later on their rise to power.]{.underline} Rather, they
originated as a theological movement in the early 1990s. They became
violent in 2004 when Houthi supporters protested in mosques with their
famous slogan "Death to America," angering then-Yemeni President Ali
Abdullah Saleh, who sent government troops to try and curb supporters.
Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, the founder of the Houthis, was killed as a
result, sparking a six-year war.

[And while [there is no doubt that the Houthis are the biggest threat
to]{.mark} the idea of the republic in [Yemen, that is not due to Iran's
role]{.mark}. [Iran's support]{.mark} to the Houthis in Yemen [is very
small compared to that of Iraq, Syria, or Lebanon]{.mark}. It's not that
Iran's support isn't a destructive force---it is---but it is not the
main or only one. [The weapons]{.mark} and business [Houthis get via the
black market]{.mark} from the Yemeni government, for example, [are worth
more than the funding they get from Iran]{.mark}. Even countries like
Oman and Russia currently have more direct leverage over the Houthis
than Iran does.]{.underline}

[But it's important to note that [the Saudi war]{.mark} didn't make the
relationship between the Houthis and Iran weaker. Rather, the war [made
the relationship more essential.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In mid-July of 2016, Yemeni President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi departed
from his residence in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, and visited the Yemeni
governorate of Marib for a few hours before returning to Riyadh. During
this rare visit by the Yemeni president from exile to one of his
governorates, and in a brief speech to a crowd of his
statesmen---including his deputy Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, Iran's arch-foe
and the sectarian antithesis to Iran's allies in Yemen---Hadi said that
he shall not allow Iran to establish a "Persian" state in Yemen.1 He
also reiterated his promise to raise the flag of the Republic of Yemen
in Maran, the Houthi leader's stronghold in Saada governorate. This
implied a direct suggestion that Saada had fallen out of the authority
of the Republic of Yemen, or that it has a leaning that is not
republican---which echoes another charge that Ansar Allah (or the
Houthis) are but an extension of the former Yemeni monarchy, or in other
words, that the group is ideologically linked to Iran. Before and after
this, President Hadi and almost all his officials, in addition to many
Gulf officials, have repeatedly stated that the war in Yemen is
effectively a war against Iran.

[On several]{.underline} other [occasions, President Hadi repeatedly
expressed his concern of Iranian expansionism in Yemen to his visiting
delegations]{.underline}, especially those from the Gulf and the West,
even at a time when he still resided in Sanaa. Hadi went as far as to
tell visiting U.S. Senator John McCain in 2013 that he feared Iran more
than al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula---America's enemy and its
foremost priority in Yemen.2 This may have been President Hadi's own
speculation of his visitor's position on Iran. Even then, [however,
President Hadi himself had a vital, albeit concealed, connection with
Tehran]{.underline}.

Many analyses have been written and official statements made concerning
Iran's ambitions in Yemen, which it especially pursued through its
relationship with its now-vigorous ally, the Houthis (Ansar Allah).3
Following their coup d'etat and takeover of power in Sanaa in January
2015, as well as their activation of a revolutionary committee in its
wake, a surprising deal was struck between the group and Iran which
further perpetuated these assumptions.4 The deal initiated nearly
fourteen weekly airline flights between Sanaa and Tehran.5 Abdulmalik
Al-Houthi, the Houthis' current leader (and brother of the late Hussein
Badreddin al-Houthi), announced that Saada airport, adjacent to the
Saudi border, would be rehabilitated so that it can receive direct
flights from Tehran. Consequently, Iran Air immediately began a series
of flights to and from Sanaa. What was peculiar about this agreement is
that Yemen, which has more than two million workers in Saudi Arabia,6
does not maintain this frequency of flights with Saudi Arabia, let alone
the handful of a few hundred---or few thousand at most7---Yemenis
residing in Tehran.

This marked a shift in Iran's role from being a hidden marginal ally
into a power at the forefront. That influence not only manifested in
Iran's alliance with a non-state group (the Houthis), but also in an
alliance with the Yemeni state itself, which by that point, the Houthis
had controlled by armed force. The number of unjustified routine flights
raised many eyebrows regarding the nature of such flights and the
content of their cargo, on either of their back-and-forth journeys
between Sanaa and Tehran. The content and cargo of these planes were
never announced to public---not even the type of passengers they were
carrying.

By early March 2015, following the inauguration of these regular
flights---and less than a week before the launching of Saudi
intervention in Yemen---one airplane was boarded by a high-ranking
delegation of Houthi and Yemeni officials en route to Tehran for a long
visit, in search of financial support for the newly imposed regime in
Sanaa.8 The delegation returned with many Iranian pledges of support,
most of which have come to no fruition, as echoed by several delegation
members later on. [It became clear,]{.underline} more so than at any
time past, [that Iran prefers to instrumentalize the Houthis and their
recent advancement, rather than deal with them on an equal footing as a
peer or a strategic ally]{.underline}---as is the case for the Iranian
government's relations with Hezbollah, for instance.

In any case, this controversy has recently and extensively resurfaced,
especially after Saudi Arabia entered the war in Yemen over two years
ago, to defeat what the Saudi government described as the growing
Iranian influence in Yemen at the expense of its own historical
influence.9 A few days prior to this campaign, the Houthis' and Saleh's
forces performed an ill-advised series of military exercises within
proximity of the Saudi border. This marked a clear and outright
challenge by a new, unruly force that is capable of anything in order to
legitimize its novel presence. This military action also coincided with
a sudden and dramatic succession and ensuing shift within the House of
Saud, which did not previously engage in military intervention. The
declared Saudi goal with which it justified its intervention was a
request by Hadi to reinstate his authority.

In either the old and the renewed discussions of this issue, the reality
is muddled between two perspectives---both of which lack accuracy. One
renders the Houthis as fateful allies and structural successors of Iran,
while the other categorically opts out of recognizing any relationship
between the two actors. Indeed, the truth lies at an ambiguous juncture
in the middle of these two extremes. To understand these intertwined
relations, one cannot but pay attention to each in a set of interrelated
elements or factors.

Not Ally or Proxy but Cheap Tool

There is indeed a direct relationship between the Houthis and Tehran:
financial, media, and political support for the Houthis from Tehran. To
a certain point, Tehran provides the Houthis with military training
support, as well. This assistance has been facilitated by advisors of
the first degree, close the Houthi leader, Abdulmalik al-Houthi, who has
coordinated support, training and funding between the two sides.
[However, the factors which have led to the emergence and perseverance
of the Houthis are local rather than external, in the sense that the
vitality of maintaining this rapport with Iran is not as fateful as
President Hadi's relationship with Riyadh, for instance. While [the
Houthis could withstand an extended hold]{.mark} over power [without
Iranian intervention]{.mark}, [President Hadi]{.mark}'s endeavor to
reclaim power [would not]{.mark} likely [survive even a few days if he
were to be abandoned by Saudi Arabia]{.mark}. This is partly due to the
fact that the real challenge facing the Houthis in Yemen is the Yemeni
public, rather than Saudi Arabia or the forces associated with Saudi
Arabia, whose relevance is secondary, not paramount.]{.underline}

[[The limitations of]{.mark} any [Iranian military support can also be
attributed to the]{.mark} simpler [fact that Yemen,]{.mark} which [is
saturated with arms and fighters]{.mark}]{.underline} (in addition to
Saleh's army and weapons arsenal[, which]{.underline} has recently
openly aligned itself with the Houthis), [undermines the urgency for
more foreign weapons or fighters.]{.underline} [Even the limited number
of advisers who were based in Yemen at the beginning of the
war]{.underline} (less than one hundred at a given time) [were then
gradually deported by the Houthis as part of their launching
negotiations]{.underline} (which later came to a halt, both the
negotiations and the rest of the deportations) [with Saudi Arabia
earlier last year.]{.underline} According to multiple diplomatic
sources,10 these agreements were briefly followed by an intermittent
ceasefire along the borders. However, Reuters later reported that
sophisticated weaponry had reached the Houthis through Oman---which was
categorically denied by the Omanis.11 The Houthis and their allies may
also benefit from Iran's military expertise more than material aid and
weaponry, which are subject to a tight embargo enforced upon Yemeni
ports by American and Egyptian naval vessels. In fact, the arms smuggled
to the Houthis and Saleh by hidden allies in the Legitimacy Front, and
the resources of the "legitimate government," according to different and
well-informed leadership sources in the Houthi-Saleh alliance and the
exile government, are far greater than those arriving from Iran. The
Legitimacy Front is comprised of all groups fighting against the
Houthis.

While the Iranian support to Houthis is clearly limited, it is still
essential for the Houthis because at this point, they do not have any
other public ally. Furthermore, the Iranian support provides the Houthis
with skills they are not good at, such as strategic planning, politics,
and some specific military specialities in dealing with complicated and
strategic weapons.

Iran Was Surprised, Too

In any case, many Iranian officials used to dealing under the table were
surprised, as the rest of the world was, by the sudden Houthi takeover
of Sanaa in September 2014.12 Many argue that the relationship between
Saleh and Iran is in many ways more consequential than the Houthis'
alliance with Iran, and this has agitated the Saudis far more than the
Houthi-Tehran connection.

[Much of the Houthis' rapport with Iran stems from their ignorance of
politics rather than their eagerness to strike an actual deal with the
Iranians.]{.underline}

[As previously alluded to, in reality, states such as Russia and
especially Oman have a more direct leverage over the
Houthis]{.underline}. Much of the Houthis' rapport with Iran stems from
their ignorance of politics rather than their eagerness to strike an
actual deal with the Iranians. This does not negate the fact that Iran
is the group's model to be emulated in public discourse---particularly
its hostility toward America and Israel echoed in the motto of Houthi
followers (which is borrowed from the Khomeini revolutionary discourse
of the late 1970s).13 Nor does it deny the fact that prominent leaders
of the group have resided in Iran for intermittent and sporadic periods
of time, especially before the publicized emergence of their movement;
as many of the Houthi leaders still own property and manage investments
in Iran.

[The above facts notwithstanding, those who managed to deter the Houthis
from forming a government after the resignation of Khaled Bahah's
government in January 2015 were the Russians, not the Iranians. Russia
is also the state that has managed to dissuade the Houthis from
attempting to form a unilateral government after their political council
appointed Abdel-Aziz bin Habtour as prime minister for a government to
be formed later.]{.underline} They came to agreement for several months,
before retracting their decision and moving towards forming the
government.14

[[To Iran, the Houthis have not,]{.mark} in fact [been]{.mark} much of
[strategic allies]{.mark}, but they could rather be perceived as the
least costly, yet the closest, middle finger that could be raised
against Saudi Arabia from its own backyard. It is true that the group is
Iran's strongest ally in Yemen, but the amount of Iranian money spent on
the Houthis is less than is spent on one aligned Lebanese political
leader, for example.]{.underline}

[Moreover, and [unlike Saudi Arabia, Iran has nothing to lose in
Yemen]{.mark}; Iran views Yemen as a low-cost environment to enact
attrition against Saudi Arabia. As a Western official formulated it: the
Iranians throw a dollar at Yemen, knowing full well that Saudi Arabia
would in turn spend 2 million, which means it is a winning battle for
Iran according to this standard.]{.underline}15

Iran has a broad suite of interests in the Arabian peninsula, most of
them focused on Saudi Arabia and Bahrain[. [Yemen is a secondary
interest for Tehran]{.mark}. For instance, Iran had a much stronger
reaction when Saudi Arabia executed Shia Saudi cleric Nimr al-Nimr in
January 2016 than it had to any aspect of the entire Saudi intervention
in Yemen]{.underline}.16 [In the international arena, Iran has worked
toward saving al-Nimr more than anything it has concretely provided for
the Houthis---and has instead settled for referencing the war in Yemen
whenever it deemed necessary to score points against Saudi Arabia, and
whenever it wished to showcase its sectarian presence in the
region.]{.underline}

A Troubled Partnership

[The relationship between the Houthis and the Iranians is not entirely
harmonious. Iran does not seem to appreciate a moderate Arab Shiism such
as Zaydism, which is beyond its control and religious authority. The
disparity between Yemen's Zaydis and Iran's Twelver Shiites is indeed
fundamental]{.underline}. [Iran, in fact, views the Zaydi component of
the Houthi doctrine as dangerous, and is working toward empowering and
abetting individuals and blocs within the Houthi group that are more
adherent to its own doctrine and more detached from to the true legacy
of Yemeni Zaydis]{.underline}. This falls in line with multiple Iranian
ventures of laying the foundation for a religious political culture
closely related to the principles of imamate and legitimate rule, to
which Yemeni Zaydis do not adhere as much---with the exception of two
minor Zaydi sects, the Kisaa'is and the Jardoudis. This is an incubation
spawning process sponsored by Tehran to its only ally in Yemen. [Most
Houthis are more concerned about the future of their relationship with
Saudi Arabia---despite the ongoing conflict---than about their alliance
with Iran. This is due to their awareness of the inevitability of
geographic, historical, and even religious realities present between
Yemen and Saudi Arabia---sectarian disparity with the regime in Saudi
Arabia notwithstanding.]{.underline}

Perhaps the most remarkable irony which dispels all of these
preconceived notions about Yemen's relationship with Iran is that Iran
supported the southern leader Ali Salem al Beidh before the two sides
parted ways as Houthis assumed authority. However, the meager numbers of
Southern Movement troops trained by Iran were in fact the same units
that have defeated the Houthi forces, expelling them from Dhale (south
of Yemen) in the middle of 2015.17

[Similar to what the United States---under both the Obama and Trump
administrations---did by outsourcing Yemen to Saudi, [Iran has
outsourced Yemen and the Houthis to Hezbollah.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Additionally, despite his constant use of publicized sectarian discourse
when addressing Iran, President Hadi has had important connections with
Iran during the past few years, which have gone to the extent of
exchanging congratulations (with the Supreme Leader of the Iranian
Revolution Khamenei, through various envoys between) at a time when
Sanaa was falling to the Houthis in September 2014. This connection was
not truly laid to rest until the increasing upsurge of dependence by
Saleh and the Houthis upon Iran, while Saudi Arabia maintained its
alliance with Hadi as a pretext for its later intervention in Yemen. At
the time, Iran had chosen the stronger bet, since Saleh and the Houthis
both enjoyed more popular support and deeper connections within the army
and state institutions. Iran has often strengthened its relationship
with the Houthis through regional mediators, such as Hezbollah, which is
another sign of the lack of clear dependence on them in a regional
gamble. Similar to what the United States---under both the Obama and
Trump administrations---did by outsourcing Yemen to Saudi, Iran has
outsourced Yemen and the Houthis to Hezbollah.

Since its establishment, Hezbollah has been the main "contractor" for
Iran's work and influence in Yemen. It remains the contact point between
the two countries, the one running trainings and "building capacity" for
the Houthis, and the one directly running the Yemen file for Iran.

[The current U.S. administration under President [Trump, like Saudi
Arabia]{.mark} and its other allies in the Yemen war, [often inflates
Iran's relationship with the Houthis and overstate the]{.mark}
supposedly exclusive nature of the [Houthis allegiance]{.mark} to
Iran]{.underline}. At the same time, the Houthi attempt to disclaim any
notion of such a relationship is also wildly inaccurate.

#### Arms sales to Saudi Arabia emboldens Iran 

Daniel **Depetris 19**, Writer for the Washington Examiner, 05/28/19,
"Trump's Decision to Arm the Saudis Against Iran Will End in Disaster,"
https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/trumps-decision-to-arm-the-saudis-against-iran-will-end-in-disaster/

[Trump, of course, has shown that he doesn't particularly care much
about Congress's concerns. But presumably, he does care about getting
the United States out of the Middle East's proxy conflicts and
sectarianism-infected rivalries. This is one of the main reasons more
weapons to the Saudis is such a colossal mistake. [By tying Washington
to the Kingdom]{.mark} so closely, [it reinforces a narrative]{.mark}
already prevalent among the Gulf monarchies [that Trump is a man who
can]{.mark} not only [be bought]{.mark} but used.]{.underline}

The fact that Washington is selling these weapons to Riyadh rather than
giving them away doesn't make this ordeal any less pathetic. The
president may not grasp the connection, but [[by opening up America's
arsenal to the Saudis, he is i]{.mark}ndirectly [deepening America's
role as a combatant in a Saudi-Iranian rivalry]{.mark} that has torn the
Middle East apart and done next to nothing to make the American people
safer. At a time when the United States should be rebalancing its force
posture and taking a hard look at where and how it allocates its limited
military resources, [Trump is bringing us deeper into a region of
diminishing geopolitical importance]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Finally, we need to evaluate this latest arms sale through the prism of
today's events. American-Iranian relations are in the pits. Direct
communication between the two nations is likely nonexistent. [Washington
is passing messages]{.mark} and warnings [to Tehran through
intermediaries]{.mark} like the Iraqis, Omanis, and Swiss. And the
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps remains on high alert status,
monitoring moves by U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf that could be
construed as aggressive or preparations for an attack.]{.underline}

Trump has talked rightly about war being the last thing he wants and has
broached the idea of a bilateral negotiation with Tehran on issues of
concern. Establishing more communication nodes with the Iranians is the
correct approach.

[[More weapons in the hands of the Saudis]{.mark}, however, [sends Iran
the]{.mark} opposite [message---that the United States is only
interested in]{.mark} talking if the topic is [full surrender]{.mark}.
And if Iran remains resistant to the idea, Washington will sell
munitions to its adversaries]{.underline} until it's ready to sign off
like the Japanese in 1945.

[It should go without saying that [this is not something the Iranians
will respond kindly to]{.mark}. The administration is confident that
maximum pressure will eventually frighten Iran to the table where it
will give up everything. More likely is the opposite---the [Iranians
will stiffen their spines.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[It's not too late for President Trump to reverse a potentially
calamitous decision. For the good of America's security, one hopes he
has second thoughts and recognizes that the U.S. and Saudi Arabia don't
always align.]{.underline}

### 1AR---Iran Turn

#### Iran support for Houthis is limited, but Saudi intervention pushes Iran deeper into the conflict

Thomas **Juneau 16,** An assistant professor at the University of
Ottawa's Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, 5/16/16,
"No, Yemen's Houthis actually aren't Iranian puppets,"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/05/16/contrary-to-popular-belief-houthis-arent-iranian-proxies/?utm_term=.d431805cd7d4

[The war intensified in March 2015 when a coalition of 10 states led by
Saudi Arabia launched a campaign of airstrikes against the Houthi-Saleh
coalition. Riyadh's declared objectives are to roll back the Houthis and
reinstate Hadi. Saudi Arabia claims that the Houthis are an Iranian
proxy, leading it to frame the war as an effort to counter Iran's
influence. The Saudis are not the only ones to label the Houthis puppets
of Iran. Politicians and media in the West, in particular, also
frequently describe them as Iranian proxies.]{.underline}

Yet as I argue in a recent article in the May 2016 issue of
International Affairs, the Chatham House journal, [[Tehran's support for
the Houthis is limited, and its influence in Yemen is marginal]{.mark}.
It is simply inaccurate to claim that the Houthis are Iranian
proxies.]{.underline}

[Instead, [the war in Yemen is driven by local grievances and
competition for power]{.mark} among Yemeni actors. The Houthis and Saleh
want to overturn the political order that emerged after the uprisings of
2011]{.underline}: Saleh wants to return to power, having lost the
presidency in the wake of popular protests, while the Houthis want a
greater say in national affairs. In other words, the Houthis want in,
Saleh wants back in, and the Hadi bloc wants to keep them both out.

Iran's limited support for the Houthis

[According to a 2015 report to the U.N. Security Council Iran Sanctions
Committee, Iran probably started providing small amounts of weapons to
the Houthis in 2009 --- five years after the first round of fighting
between the Houthis and government forces. In 2011, U.S. officials ---
who until then had been dismissive of such accusations --- started to
acknowledge that Iran was likely responsible for the delivery of
automatic rifles, grenade launchers and cash, probably in the millions
of dollars.]{.underline}

The Houthi's takeover of Sanaa, Yemen's capital, in September 2014
prompted Iran to increase its support. It now appears that small numbers
--- perhaps dozens --- of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)
officers, with assistance from Lebanese Hezbollah, have set up a train
and equip program for the Houthis. There have also been reports of
intensifying shipping activity between Iran and Yemen.

[This [assistance]{.mark}, however, [remains limited and far from
sufficient to make more than a marginal difference]{.mark} to the
balance of forces [in Yemen]{.mark}, a country awash with weapons. There
is therefore no supporting evidence to the claim that Iran has bought
itself any significant measure of influence over Houthi
decision-making.]{.underline}

Common interests, not common faith

What's in it for Tehran? Iran supports groups throughout the Middle East
when two conditions are met. The Islamic Republic, first, takes
advantage of instability to penetrate weak polities. Second, it targets
dissatisfied political parties or militias who oppose, violently or
non-violently, the domestic or regional status quo. In doing so, Iran
wants to gain access to an area that it can later use as a launching pad
to pressure its regional rivals, especially Saudi Arabia and Israel, and
to oppose the regional U.S. presence. It also seeks to boost its
deterrence, by arming its partners so that they could retaliate against
U.S. interests or partners in the event of a war. More broadly, Iran
uses these ties to build influence in weak polities, aiming to position
itself as an indispensable regional power.

What brings Iran and the Houthis together is not a common Shiite faith,
as is often implied in Western media, where one regularly reads
references to the Houthis as "Shia." This is not technically inaccurate:
The Houthis are Zaydis, a small branch of Shiism distinct from the
Twelver Shiism practiced by a majority of the region's Shiites. It is
misleading, however: Their beliefs diverge significantly, and many
Zaydis in Yemen are opposed to the Houthis.

Rather, a common dissatisfaction with the status quo drives their
partnership. Iran opposes the regional order, dominated by the United
States and its partners, especially Saudi Arabia and Israel. At the same
time, the Houthis oppose the Hadi government, itself backed by Saudi
Arabia. Many of the Houthis' domestic rivals in Yemen, such as the Islah
party, moreover, back the Hadi government and are supported by Riyadh.
There is, in sum, a convergence of interests among the Houthis, Iran and
former president Saleh, on one side, and the pro-status quo forces of
the remnants of the Hadi government, its domestic backers and Saudi
Arabia, on the other.

Limited returns on a modest investment

In this context, [[Tehran has come to recognize that a minor investment
in Yemen can yield limited but interesting returns]{.mark}. Instability
in Yemen, first, has opened a tempting door for Iran to build a small
presence on Saudi Arabia's southern border. More importantly, the
growing dissatisfaction of the Houthis and their rising power has led
Iran to view them as an attractive partner.]{.underline} At the same
time, Iran's increasingly difficult relation with Hamas (which has sided
with the opposition in Syria's civil war) and uncertainty surrounding
the future of its most valuable alliances (with the Assad regime and
Hezbollah, because of the Syrian civil war) may have pushed Tehran to
develop new partnerships.

[Iran's investment in Yemen has been limited; it has therefore brought
only limited influence. [Tehran does not have the ability to shape
events in Yemen]{.mark}; contrary to the claims of an obscure Iranian
parliamentarian whose hubris has been frequently repeated, Iran does not
control a fourth Arab capital in Sana'a. [If anything, Iran has
bandwagoned on Houthi successes]{.mark}: It did not cause them but wants
to see them consolidated.]{.underline}

[The irony, of course, is that [one of Saudi Arabia's stated
objectives]{.mark} for intervening in Yemen in March 2015 [was to roll
back a]{.mark} mostly [fictitious Iranian influence]{.mark}. [The
intervention]{.mark}, however, is [having the opposite effect]{.mark}:
[The Houthis are a small non-state actor attacked by a regional
power]{.mark} with deep pockets and advanced weaponry. [It is then only
rational for the Houthis to seek assistance, albeit only small amounts,
from]{.mark} the only external power willing and able to support them
--- [Iran.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Iran's influence is limited, and Saudi Arabia's involvement makes the conflict more sectarian 

Elisabeth **Kendall 17,** senior research fellow in Arabic & Islamic
Studies at Pembroke College, University of Oxford, 10/17, "Iran's
Fingerprints in Yemen,"
http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/images/Irans_Fingerprints_in_Yemen_web_1019.pdf

This paper attempts to steer a path through the many conflicting
statements and reports about Iran's fingerprints in Yemen. [Iranian
involvement is beyond doubt. The difficulty lies in separating the
rhetoric from the real activity. This is because the various warring
parties, including Iran, merely stating that Iran is involved cannot be
considered evidence, particularly when---as has been shown herein---it
is in the interests of all sides to talk it up. Bellicose Iranian
rhetoric, especially prior to March 2015 when the Saudi-led coalition
began its air strikes in Yemen, might be seen as a cheap option for
Iran. It has been able to watch Saudi Arabia become deeply entrenched in
an expensive war that will be difficult to win outright, is damaging its
international credibility, and distracts it from becoming more involved
in countering Iran's interests in Syria.]{.underline} [[There is]{.mark}
certainly [evidence of Iran supplying limited amounts o]{.mark}f mainly
small [weapons]{.mark} and advisers to the Houthis. [However, tangible
evidence for Iranian military assistance i]{.mark}n the form of heavy
weapons [that could decisively change the course of the war is
scant]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The alliance that the Houthis forged with
former President Ali Abdullah Saleh has to date been far more pivotal to
Houthi successes than Iranian assistance. [With or without Iran's
involvement, the]{.mark} underlying structure of the [conflict and
Houthi grievances would]{.mark} likely [be the
same]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, it is important not to be complacent
about Iran's ambitions in Yemen. As shown, the Houthis have started to
use increasingly sophisticated weaponry even though this cannot at
present be directly linked to Iran. [[The start of the Saudi]{.mark}-led
military [campaign]{.mark} in Yemen [meant Iran could afford to shift
its rhetorical emphasis to]{.mark} position itself as
[peace-seeking]{.mark} in contradistinction to a war-mongering Saudi
Arabia.]{.underline} Despite the Iranian government's protestations,
there are still indications that the Quds Force, or a hardline element
within in it, is pursuing a more aggressive strategy in Yemen. It is
easy to see why it might be in Iran's interests to see a "Lebanization"
of the conflict. If Yemen's political landscape becomes totally
fractured, the Houthis could become the dominant militia, much like
Hezbollah in Lebanon, leaning towards Iran and away from Saudi Arabia.70
Such a fractious political landscape could present an ongoing
distraction for Saudi Arabia for decades to come. One final aspect of
influence that is often missed amid the heavy focus on unraveling the
provenance of Houthi military capability is the cultural aspect.71 The
Houthi TV channel al-Masirah, founded in 2012, is run from Beirut's
Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs. Al-Masirah bills itself as a
Yemeni network that "seeks to spread awareness, proper values and
justice among different sectors of Arab and Islamic societies, based on
Qur'anic culture and giving priority to the Palestinian issue."72 In
reality, the programming is sectarian, heavily anti-Saudi Arabia and
pro-Houthi. Its narratives of an oppressed people fighting corruption
and marginalization reflect those propagated by Hezbollah. There is some
evidence of a recent ratcheting up in Houthi cultural activity. Yemenis
living in Sana'a told this author that the Houthis are now aggressively
pushing their ideology using billboards and graffiti designed to
enshrine their leader as religiously sanctioned by God. Moreover, in an
April 2017 al-Qaeda film, a Houthi captive comments that he was engaged
in non-military operations that were "cultural and religious" in
nature.73 While the al-Qaeda evidence is likely to be highly selective,
even tribesmen in Yemen's remote east, far from the battlefronts and
largely impervious to sectarian concerns, commented to this author that
the television celebrations of the Prophet's birthday in Sana'a last
August felt significantly more "Shia" to them. In essence, [[the longer
the war continues, the more vulnerable]{.mark} the [Houthis will become
to Iran]{.mark}ian influence---[more from necessity than ideological
alignment]{.mark}, but the latter may follow in time]{.underline}. There
may already be hardline elements inside the Houthi camp--- Hezbollah and
Iran's Quds Force (or indeed some other Iranian entity) are
collaborating more closely than their respective leaderships either
acknowledge or desire. [[This]{.mark} in turn [will exacerbate the
sectarian nature of the war, a development that can]{.mark} only [fuel
the appeal]{.mark} and recruitment prospects [of militant jihadist
groups]{.mark} like al-Qaeda and the Islamic State in
Yemen]{.underline}. Both will use the war and its aftermath as an
opportunity to pin the local Houthi enemy onto the global jihadist
agenda of an existential battle against Shia "rejectionists" and other
perceived infidels. [Thus, [a conflict that began]{.mark} essentially
[as a politically]{.mark} and tribally [motivated dispute over
territory,]{.mark} resources, and power [may]{.mark} yet over time [turn
into a long-term cycle of]{.mark} bloody [sectarian violence.]{.mark} In
this respect, [the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen
is]{.mark}]{.underline}---to some extent---[[helping to exacerbate
the]{.mark} very [problem it claimed to]{.mark} be designed to
[solve.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 2AC- Maximum Pressure Fails 

#### US policy against Iran fails---Iran has learned to manage the pressure 

Amirmohammad **Soori 19**, a visiting researcher at Georgetown
University\'s Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian
Understanding, 5/8/19, "New U.S. Policy Toward Iran: Right Questions,
Wrong Solution,"
https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/posts/new-u-s-policy-toward-iran-right-questions-wrong-solution

[Iran-U.S. relations have reached their worst condition in decades, and
the key question is whether the United States has achieved its goals, or
if this new strategy can be useful? This new strategy of "[maximum
pressure]{.mark} and negotiation" [ha]{.mark}s very [clear
elements]{.mark} that the United States has tried to implement, [but the
result and future]{.mark} [remains obscure.]{.mark}]{.underline}

President Donald Trump got the United States out of the Iran nuclear
agreement, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action
(JCPOA), and imposed tougher sanctions on Iran. Recently, the
administration officially designated Iran\'s Islamic Revolutionary Guard
Corps as a "Foreign Terrorist Organization," a move some in the
administration had opposed over concerns about potential risks to U.S.
troops in the Middle East. In addition, the White House announced it
would end all sanction exemptions for countries that import Iranian
crude oil.

Trump says the Iran deal is defective at its core. A new one will
require real commitments. He outlined four main concerns to address when
countering Iran, which included the JCPOA's short-term concerns, its
ballistic missile program, and its regional activities in places such as
Syria. It seems that Trump has some valid questions about the previous
deal with Iran, but his current policy will not produce useful results.

[In the short term, the White House has had some achievements, but in
the long term, [the result may backfire because of]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
complicated [situation in the Middle East,]{.mark} Iran's ability to
manage crises, [and]{.mark} [the lack of]{.mark} appropriate
[alternatives]{.mark} for the Islamic Republic.]{.underline}

The Short Life of JCPOA

A few days after JCPOA's start, Iran test-fired two ballistic missiles
with the phrase \"Israel must be wiped out\" written on them. Also, the
intensification of Iran\'s regional activities has led the United States
to conclude that Iran is failing to fulfill the \"spirit\" of its
landmark nuclear deal with world powers. In practice, the United States
has kept some other sanctions against Iran and stated that those
sanctions did not relate to Iran\'s nuclear issues. Those remaining
sanctions did not allow Iran to fully exploit the benefits of JCPOA.

Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president, realized that the nuclear deal
alone was not enough. Meetings with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry,
as well as the process of nuclear talks, has led Rouhani to conclude
that Iran has to talk about regional issues and missile issues for a
proper agreement with the West. This is why Rouhani proposed the second
and third JCPOA; though the proposal was partly inspired by internal
coherence and internal economic issues, another part addressed
continuation of negotiations with the United States and EU countries.
Such a proposal was faced with a sharp reaction by Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei. In a lecture in Mashhad, Khamenei strongly opposed more
negotiations with the United States and stated that Iran cannot trust
them. Then, he blocked any kind of negotiation.

Although European companies could enter Iran\'s market after the JCPOA,
American companies could not or did not want to enter Iran because of
other U.S. government sanctions. In a dialogue with French President
Emmanuel Macron, Trump noted that France and the EU countries have made
significant investments in Iran and they are making more money. Even
after this critique, Bijan Zanganeh, the Iranian oil minister, invited
the United States to invest in the Iranian oil industry as well. These
debates show that the United States felt that it could not use the JCPOA
properly.

Once the JCPOA started to work, there were huge disagreements and
problems. Trump's year-long pressure to correct this agreement faced
Iran\'s opposition and Europe\'s inability to proceed. As a result, he
decided to start a new era where the United States is the main actor,
but it is unclear if Trump can finish this new game.

Political Gamble

It cannot be denied that the United States has somewhat achieved its
goals. Limitation of Hezbollah\'s financial sources and the internal
economic problems of Iran are due to the effects of U.S. sanctions.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Trump seem quite satisfied. For this
reason, they are increasing sanctions almost every month.

Although Iran\'s oil exports have decreased by half, reaching about 1.2
million barrels per day, the United States still seeks to eliminate oil
exports from this market. Although political reasons are evident in this
decision, economic decision-making is important, too. In fact, sanctions
on Iran, Venezuela, or even Russia can be useful for U.S. oil companies
to enter the market. With South Korea now uncertain about the longevity
of its Iranian oil purchase waiver, it has begun testing super-light
U.S. oil sold by Anadarko Petroleum Corp as a substitute for Iranian
crude while it awaits word from Washington on whether it can keep buying
oil from the Middle Eastern nation.

[In spite of]{.underline} these [achievements, the U.S. strategy seems
to be precarious with respect to Iran. [After]{.mark} over 40 [years of
sanctions, Iran has learned how to manage pressure.]{.mark} The White
House mentioned that oil exports from Iran should be zero, but it seems
likely that Iran will export about 500,000 barrels of oil in 2019,
thanks to smuggling and the U.S.-granted temporary waiver.]{.underline}

[[If]{.mark} Iran\'s [oil exports are reduced to zero, it could be
dangerous for]{.mark} Persian [Gulf security.]{.mark} The second concern
is the very fragile situation of the oil market. Iran and Venezuela are
major oil-exporting countries, and [the disappearance of]{.mark} these
two countries' [oil markets could have]{.mark} a []{.mark}serious
[negative short-term effects]{.mark}. Also, it is right that exports of
about only 500,000 barrels will lead to a reduction in government
revenue, but a complete economic collapse seems unlikely]{.underline}.
Of course, the possibility of secret exchanges with Iraq, Russia, and
China cannot be discounted and is perhaps even likely.

[When examining the effect of sanctions on regional activities, the
claims raised are exaggerated]{.underline}. When the Obama
administration negotiated the nuclear deal, President Barack Obama
acknowledged that sanctions relief for Tehran would inevitably mean more
money for groups like Hezbollah. But he also insisted it wouldn't make
much of a difference in terms of Iran's capacity to make mischief in the
Middle East. "[Iran is feeling a financial pinch, but [there is no
evidence the pinch has affected Tehran's ability]{.mark} or willingness
[to act as it does]{.mark} in the Middle East]{.underline}," says Paul
Pillar, a former CIA officer who's now a professor at Georgetown
University. "[Iran does what it does in the Middle East not according to
how much money it has, but instead according to what it sees as in its
own security interests.]{.underline}"

[Iran decided to reform its budget structure and has understood
throughout its history that it should not be so dependent on oil. Some
officials say that [sanctions could be an opportunity for Iran.]{.mark}
There will be no other way to prevent the worsening of the economic
situation in Iran than structural reforms and prevention of
corruption.]{.underline}

The most desirable situation for the United States is the start of
political turmoil as a result of the deteriorating economic situation in
Iran. The January and February 2018 demonstrations were probably an
incentive for Trump to set massive economic sanctions to encourage
political turmoil in Iran. But despite the fact that Iran had a bad year
last year, there has been no serious political and economic turmoil in
Iran.

Although the Iranian people may have a severe opinion of political
rulers, it is beyond ridiculous to imagine John Bolton (Trump\'s shrewd
national security adviser) and Maryam Rajavi (leader of MEK) in
Tehran\'s Freedom Square. In fact, the reimposition of U.S. sanctions on
Tehran will further unite the Iranian nation against the foreign threat.
The Iranian reformist Hajarian said that because of the lack of
leadership for economic problems, this kind of demonstration seen in
2018 cannot be successful. On the other hand, as many analysts state,
the main problem of the Iranian economy is not Trump in the United
States. The problem is the Iranian Trumps, who are ruining the country
with ignorance or betrayal.

[Trump has turned into a high-rolling gambler. If his hunches are wrong,
[the losses could include a trade clash]{.mark} between the United
States and Europe, [a surge in Iranian-backed violence]{.mark} and
terrorism, [and grave damage to]{.mark} the decades-long cause of
nuclear [non-proliferation]{.mark}. That would be a bet without
winners.]{.underline}

### 1AR- Maximum Pressure Fails 

#### US policies won't tamper Iranian aggression 

Aaron **Stein 19**, The director of the Middle East Program at the
Foreign Policy Research Institute, 4/12/19, "THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S
IRAN POLICY IS A MESS,"
https://warontherocks.com/2019/04/the-trump-administrations-iran-policy-is-a-mess/

[The Trump administration is a walking billboard for the value of
nuclear weapons --- and the most recent [sanctions]{.mark} levied on the
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps [will]{.mark} further [undermine
any]{.mark} coherent American [policy to grapple with the spread of
nuclear technology]{.mark} in the Middle East]{.underline}. Nuclear
technology is 76 years old, and many countries have the requisite
capabilities, or access to a coterie of suppliers, to overcome key
bottlenecks and develop nuclear weapons. Iran is no exception and had
plans to build five nuclear weapons in secret until the government made
the political decision in 2003 to halt coordinated weapons related work
(albeit with continued centrifuge development) and make the necessary
concessions to verify this decision through agreements with the
international community.

At its core, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), dubbed the
Iran "nuclear deal" for short, put in place monitoring mechanisms to
verify the Iranian government's pledge not to build nuclear weapons. To
ensure an agreement with Iran, certain elements of the JCPOA's
inspection regime will remain in place throughout the 25-year agreement,
while others are set to expire at different times. Eventually, Iran
would be treated like a "normal" nuclear state in 2040, when the extra
inspection provisions will end. After 2040, Iran would still be subject
to monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the safeguards
regime the United States and the rest of the world relies on to ensure
the peaceful use of nuclear technology.

[The Trump administration's policy of ending the inducements given to
Iran for its decision to allow for more robust inspections and a pledge
of peaceful nuclear intent could have a negative effect on regional
nonproliferation norms. Beyond this, it is unlikely the unprecedented
move to label an element of the Iranian government a terrorist group
would bring about the collapse of the Iranian regime --- the intended
end-goal of the current American policy[. Sanctions]{.mark} are intended
to impose an economic cost on countries to change behavior. However,
[when implemented independent of]{.mark} any inducement or a [positive
enticement to change]{.mark} the policy choices of an adversarial
regime, [there is little evidence to suggest a]{.mark} "sticks only"
approach leads to [policy change.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The problem with the Trump administration's sanctioning of the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps is that it severely complicates any current
or future effort to offer the Iranian government a "carrot" to alter or
amend military or foreign policy in the Middle East --- a region where
the United States remains heavily engaged, with no plans to leave in the
foreseeable future. Worse, [the decision]{.mark} to sanction a uniformed
military unit as a Foreign Terrorist Organization [risks establishing a
new]{.mark} (and negative) [global norm, whereby governments can]{.mark}
simply c[hoose to label adversarial]{.mark} armed forces akin to
[non-state actors, and]{.mark} therefore [make them legitimate military
targets.]{.mark}]{.underline} Indeed, this has already been the case
with the Global War on Terror and the legitimization of a country's
right to target groups in third countries in the name of combating
terrorism. [The risk, now, is that [the goalposts have moved regarding
who and what is a terrorist group]{.mark} and how to use military force
against a uniformed adversary that politicians have labelled as a
terrorist.]{.underline}

For a country like the United States, which has escalation dominance
over any potential adversary, this may not be too concerning (although,
for troops deployed in Iraq, the stakes are different than for the
country as a whole). [However, for American allies and partners
embroiled in disputes with irregular forces that receive support from
uniformed military personnel, many of which are engaged in low-intensity
conflicts with neighbors, the precedent could lead to outcomes the Trump
administration has not accounted for. One potential negative outcome
could be other countries following the Trump administration's lead and
deeming foreign militaries it disagrees with as terrorist organizations
deserving of targeting for acts of "terror" committed in the name of a
foreign armed service's uniformed branch.]{.underline}

[Beyond this, the [broader efforts to link American sanctions
with]{.mark} [efforts to deepen partnerships]{.mark} with key Gulf
states, [including]{.mark} more pronounced cooperation on [arms
sales]{.mark} and even civil nuclear technology with the aim of
deepening support on countering Iran, [risk]{.mark}s the [further
undermining]{.mark} of regional and global [nonproliferation
norms]{.mark}. The two issues may not seem connected. However, there is
a clear linkage between open-ended American support for Saudi Arabia as
a means to combat Iranian influence and ensure continued access to
regional airbases. This outcome may risk further eroding American
national security because the United States will not have received any
real tangible benefit for its alliance-building efforts and instead will
have suffered overwhelming negative consequences that undermine broader
foreign policy concerns.]{.underline}

The Trump administration is on the precipice of undermining the JCPOA,
which verifies that Iran continues to abide by its pledge to not seek
out nuclear weapons, and undercutting efforts to include language that
bars enrichment and reprocessing in countries that sign nuclear
cooperation agreements with the United States. All of this could stem
from interlinked decision-making to pressure Iran for long-halted past
activities, and to use sanctions to prevent future American concessions
to Iran (which would to induce real political change in the country).
[[This approach]{.mark}, all in the name of the "maximum pressure"
strategy, [is]{.mark} not [working]{.mark} and is now being implemented
so as to tie the hands of future American administrations ---[in ways
that undermine America's relationship with Europe and erode trust in
international organizations]{.mark}. The outcome, of course, is a weaker
Washington, independent of any notional changes in Iran. This isn't a
smart strategy; in fact, it is counter-productive and harmful to
American interests.]{.underline}

Regime Change via Sanction: Maximum Pressure and Economic Coercion

From the outset of his time in office, President Donald Trump has sought
to dismantle the JCPOA, arguing incorrectly that the agreement needs to
be "fixed" to enshrine the inspection provisions in the nuclear
agreement forever. Brian Hook, the Trump administration's special
representative for Iran, incorrectly asserted that nations should demand
that Tehran "end the pursuit of nuclear weapons," an assertion at odds
with American intelligence estimates. In a more nefarious way, the Trump
administration is moving the goal posts, claiming that Iran's harboring
of Al Qaeda operatives after the October 2001 invasion of Afghanistan
toppled the Taliban is proof that Tehran supports Al Qaeda. Therefore, a
U.S. military strike would be legal under the Authorization to Use
Military Force (AUMF), which authorized military action against nations
and actors linked to the 9/11 attacks.

The administration's goals are twofold. First, Trump's national security
team is using the media to reinforce a narrative about Iran's
relationship with Al Qaeda to keep options to circumvent the
congressional check on the use of force, no matter how flimsy that has
become since 9/11. Second, this effort signals to Iran that "all
options" remain on the table to bolster sanctions and to pressure the
regime. In the case of the latter, Mark Dubowitz, the head of the
Foundation for Defense of Democracies, made the case directly in an
op-ed, where he argued that the United States should pair sanctions with
clandestine support for Iranian labor unions to foment unrest similar to
the labor strikes in 1980s era Poland that eventually led to the end of
communist rule in 1989.This unrest, then, would either lead to the
toppling of the regime, or a country so weak that it would capitulate to
American demands and modify its foreign policy. Iran's demonstrated
track-record would suggest that the regime would react violently to any
mass protest, and recent lessons from the Middle East suggest that even
weak regimes are capable of using overwhelming force to ensure that the
regime survives. American tools, in cases where the regime does choose
to stand and fight, are quite limited.

[The Trump administration's heavy use of sanctions to compel changes in
Iranian policy does not have the necessary support from key American
allies (Europe), is opposed by American adversaries (Russia and China),
and is beyond U.S. capabilities to unilaterally implement. These three
factors, in combination, will ensure that the self-declared "maximum
pressure" effort will fail.]{.underline} In a vacuum, the failure of an
American foreign policy is not that big of a deal. Policy fails. Leaders
change. New policy is enacted.

[However, the legacy of this particular screw-up will outlive the Trump
administration and further undermine nonproliferation norms. For
decades, the United States has been able to rely on a policy of
technology denial and inspection to prevent the spread of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. Ironically, the Islamic Republic of Iran is a
nonproliferation success story. This may seem counterintuitive, given
that the Islamic Republic made the choice to clandestinely build nuclear
weapons in the 1980s and eventually managed to develop enrichment
technology in the early 2000s. The regime tried to keep this secret and
failed. U.S. and allied intelligence detected Iran's nuclear
developments and made the decision to publicly reveal the existence of
key nuclear facilities in 2002, just as the regime was preparing to
expand enrichment capacity.

In a tranche of documents and in a presentation that Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave to the world and then laundered through
friendly U.S. think tanks ---including the Foundation for Defense of
Democracies and the Institute for Science and International Security ---
Tehran sought to build five 10-kiloton nuclear warheads for delivery by
ballistic missile. The development of nuclear weapons would, no matter
what the scale and scope of Iran's ambition, change security dynamics in
the Middle East and severely constrain American and allied policy
options. However, the documents suggested Iran intended to pursue the
South Africa model, which built a small number of bombs in secret, and
only planned to use them if the country was invaded and the regime
threatened. This approach is, at its core, defensive and indicative of a
leadership that felt fundamentally insecure and willing to absorb
considerable cost to ensure that it would have the tools to prevent
regime collapse. This is obviously a problem, given that continued
coercion could re-ignite these concerns, empowering the elements within
the Iranian government that lobbied to develop nuclear weapons in the
first place.

[The JCPOA, in this sense, also had the secondary political outcome of
signaling that American military intervention to prevent Iranian nuclear
development was decidedly off the table]{.underline}. The United States,
along with Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Russia, and China,
reached agreement with the Iranian government as an equal and imposed a
set of criteria for Tehran to meet in return for reciprocal actions from
these world powers. [[To date, Iran has met its obligations, only to be
repaid with a U.S. withdrawal and]{.mark}, now, the imposition of
[sanctions]{.mark} beyond those that were in place before the American
violation of its own agreement. With the Islamic Revolutionary Guards
Corps now under further American sanctions, [Iranian policymakers would
be unwise not to consider]{.mark} the case of [North
Korea]{.mark}]{.underline}, a partner in the development of Iranian
ballistic missiles, and the country that provided Iran's ally, Syria,
with a reactor to build nuclear weapons in secret. [[In contrast]{.mark}
to Iran's "bomb in the basement" approach followed by President Hassan
Rouhani's acceptance of key U.S. demands, [North Korea loudly
developed]{.mark} nuclear [weapons]{.mark} and the capabilities to
target American cities]{.underline} with long-range missiles (both in
defiance of U.S. and global pressure) --- [[and was rewarded]{.mark}
with two high-profile summits with the American president and Trump's
personal intervention to roll back sanctions]{.underline}. [In essence,
Chairman Kim Jong Un was rewarded for building the bomb, while Iran was
punished for giving it up.]{.underline}

## AT Terrorism Impacts

### AT: Terror -- No Spillover

#### Ending arms sales won't spillover to harm counter terror cooperation\-\--Saudi Arabia has an interest in protecting itself\-\--backlashing to the plan would be counterproductive for them

Nabeel **Khoury 18**, Atlantic Council, 10/23/18, "Oil, Arms, and
Counterterrorism: A Look At Saudi Options and How Far the Kingdom May
Go,"
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/oil-arms-and-counterterrorism-a-look-at-saudi-options-and-how-far-the-kingdom-may-go

[Counterterrorism cooperation]{.underline}

Outside the obvious Saudi dependency on the United States to come to its
defense in the highly unlikely scenario of a direct attack by Iran,
[[counterterror]{.mark}ism [collaboration]{.mark} is [a double edged
sword. The kingdom is much more vulnerable to terrorist attacks than the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, being in the neighborhood where al Qaeda
has long operated and where ISIS now remains]{.underline}, not only in
Syria and Iraq, but more importantly next door in Yemen.

All this to say that [[raising the specter of a cut-off of]{.mark}
economic, military, and [security cooperation]{.mark} by Saudi Arabia
[is bogus. It would be]{.mark} the equivalent of the proverbial [cutting
off one's nose to spite one's face. Saudi Arabia is]{.mark} much [more
dependent on the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [than the other way
around. In weighting how much pressure to apply]{.mark} to affect Saudi
behavior in the region, the [Trump]{.mark} administration [should not be
overly concerned with losing significant equities]{.mark}]{.underline},
as has been repeatedly implied by Trump and by other administration
officials.

### 2AC---Extremist Turn 

#### Saudi Arabia involvement emboldens extremist and makes Yemen conflict more sectarian 

Elisabeth **Kendall 17,** senior research fellow in Arabic & Islamic
Studies at Pembroke College, University of Oxford, 10/17, "Iran's
Fingerprints in Yemen,"
http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/images/Irans_Fingerprints_in_Yemen_web_1019.pdf

This paper attempts to steer a path through the many conflicting
statements and reports about Iran's fingerprints in Yemen. [Iranian
involvement is beyond doubt. The difficulty lies in separating the
rhetoric from the real activity. This is because the various warring
parties, including Iran, merely stating that Iran is involved cannot be
considered evidence, particularly when---as has been shown herein---it
is in the interests of all sides to talk it up. Bellicose Iranian
rhetoric, especially prior to March 2015 when the Saudi-led coalition
began its air strikes in Yemen, might be seen as a cheap option for
Iran. It has been able to watch Saudi Arabia become deeply entrenched in
an expensive war that will be difficult to win outright, is damaging its
international credibility, and distracts it from becoming more involved
in countering Iran's interests in Syria.]{.underline} [[There is]{.mark}
certainly [evidence of Iran supplying limited amounts o]{.mark}f mainly
small [weapons]{.mark} and advisers to the Houthis. [However, tangible
evidence for Iranian military assistance i]{.mark}n the form of heavy
weapons [that could decisively change the course of the war is
scant]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The alliance that the Houthis forged with
former President Ali Abdullah Saleh has to date been far more pivotal to
Houthi successes than Iranian assistance. [With or without Iran's
involvement, the]{.mark} underlying structure of the [conflict and
Houthi grievances would]{.mark} likely [be the
same]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, it is important not to be complacent
about Iran's ambitions in Yemen. As shown, the Houthis have started to
use increasingly sophisticated weaponry even though this cannot at
present be directly linked to Iran. [[The start of the Saudi]{.mark}-led
military [campaign]{.mark} in Yemen [meant Iran could afford to shift
its rhetorical emphasis to]{.mark} position itself as
[peace-seeking]{.mark} in contradistinction to a war-mongering Saudi
Arabia.]{.underline} Despite the Iranian government's protestations,
there are still indications that the Quds Force, or a hardline element
within in it, is pursuing a more aggressive strategy in Yemen. It is
easy to see why it might be in Iran's interests to see a "Lebanization"
of the conflict. If Yemen's political landscape becomes totally
fractured, the Houthis could become the dominant militia, much like
Hezbollah in Lebanon, leaning towards Iran and away from Saudi Arabia.70
Such a fractious political landscape could present an ongoing
distraction for Saudi Arabia for decades to come. One final aspect of
influence that is often missed amid the heavy focus on unraveling the
provenance of Houthi military capability is the cultural aspect.71 The
Houthi TV channel al-Masirah, founded in 2012, is run from Beirut's
Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs. Al-Masirah bills itself as a
Yemeni network that "seeks to spread awareness, proper values and
justice among different sectors of Arab and Islamic societies, based on
Qur'anic culture and giving priority to the Palestinian issue."72 In
reality, the programming is sectarian, heavily anti-Saudi Arabia and
pro-Houthi. Its narratives of an oppressed people fighting corruption
and marginalization reflect those propagated by Hezbollah. There is some
evidence of a recent ratcheting up in Houthi cultural activity. Yemenis
living in Sana'a told this author that the Houthis are now aggressively
pushing their ideology using billboards and graffiti designed to
enshrine their leader as religiously sanctioned by God. Moreover, in an
April 2017 al-Qaeda film, a Houthi captive comments that he was engaged
in non-military operations that were "cultural and religious" in
nature.73 While the al-Qaeda evidence is likely to be highly selective,
even tribesmen in Yemen's remote east, far from the battlefronts and
largely impervious to sectarian concerns, commented to this author that
the television celebrations of the Prophet's birthday in Sana'a last
August felt significantly more "Shia" to them. In essence, [[the longer
the war continues, the more vulnerable]{.mark} the [Houthis will become
to Iran]{.mark}ian influence---[more from necessity than ideological
alignment]{.mark}, but the latter may follow in time]{.underline}. There
may already be hardline elements inside the Houthi camp--- Hezbollah and
Iran's Quds Force (or indeed some other Iranian entity) are
collaborating more closely than their respective leaderships either
acknowledge or desire. [[This]{.mark} in turn [will exacerbate the
sectarian nature of the war, a development that can]{.mark} only [fuel
the appeal]{.mark} and recruitment prospects [of militant jihadist
groups]{.mark} like al-Qaeda and the Islamic State in
Yemen]{.underline}. Both will use the war and its aftermath as an
opportunity to pin the local Houthi enemy onto the global jihadist
agenda of an existential battle against Shia "rejectionists" and other
perceived infidels. [Thus, [a conflict that began]{.mark} essentially
[as a politically]{.mark} and tribally [motivated dispute over
territory,]{.mark} resources, and power [may]{.mark} yet over time [turn
into a long-term cycle of]{.mark} bloody [sectarian violence.]{.mark} In
this respect, [the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen
is]{.mark}]{.underline}---to some extent---[[helping to exacerbate
the]{.mark} very [problem it claimed to]{.mark} be designed to
[solve.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 2AC---Weapons Diversion Turn

#### Arms sale to Saudi increase the risk of Tehran and terrorists gaining access to US weaponry and intelligence---That's Elbagir 

#### Saudis are using US arms to give Iranians and terrorists valuable US tech and info

**Haaretz 19**, The longest running print newspaper in Israel, 2/6/19,
"U.S. Investigating Saudi Arabia Giving U.S. Weapons to Al-Qaida and
Iran in Yemen, Report Says,"
https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/u-s-investigating-saudi-arabia-giving-u-s-weapons-to-al-qaida-and-iran-in-yemen-r-1.6911550

[A U.S. Department of Defense official confirmed to CNN that the U.S. is
investigating whether or not Saudi Arabia and its coalition members gave
al-Qaida, Salafi militias and other factions in Yemen U.S. produced
weapons. CNN reported on Monday that [U.S. weapons and]{.mark} highly
sensitive [military secrets]{.mark} [sent to the Saudis]{.mark} and
Emiratis [ended up in the hands of U.S. rivals in Yemen]{.mark}, in
violation of U.S.-Saudi coalition arms agreements.]{.underline} The
Trump administration\'s support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen has
long been controversial in the U.S. with the Senate voting 56-41 in
December to pass a resolution that would withdraw most U.S. forces from
Yemen. [Local commanders told CNN during its investigation that the
[Saudis]{.mark} and the United Arab Emirates [are using U.S. weapons as
currency to buy off different factions]{.mark} and militias in the
Yemeni conflict - [including Iranian-backed
fighters]{.mark}.]{.underline} CNN concluded that [the [transactions are
"exposing]{.mark} some of [America\'s sensitive military technology to
Tehran]{.mark} [and potentially endangering the lives of U.S.
troops]{.mark} in other conflict zones." The conflict, widely seen in
the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, has been bogged
down in a military stalemate for years.]{.underline}

### 1AR---Weapons Diversion Turn

#### US arms sales are emboldening Saudi Arabia and the UAE to divert weapons to dangerous insurgency groups 

Jodi **Viodi 19**, Jodi Vittori is a nonresident scholar in the
Democracy, Conflict, and Governance Program, 2/19/19, "American Weapons
in the Wrong Hands,"
https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/02/19/american-weapons-in-wrong-hands-pub-78408

Earlier this month, a CNN investigation provided further evidence that
[[U.S. military equipment has been transferred]{.mark} from Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) [to a variety of militias,
including]{.mark} some linked to [al-Qaeda.]{.mark}]{.underline} Given
the additional scrutiny of U.S.-Saudi relations since the murder of
journalist Jamal Khashoggi, recent U.S. Senate and House resolutions on
arms sales to Saudi Arabia, and ongoing Saudi and Emirati tensions with
neighbor Qatar, now is the time for a full-scale review of U.S. arms
sales to the Gulf region. [There are clear rules against arms transfers
to third parties. There are also end-use monitoring requirements for
U.S. arms exports, but these checks are hardly universal]{.underline}.
Given that at least some of the equipment found in militia hands can be
tied to U.S. arms sales, the Department of Defense, State Department,
and Commerce Department are clearly not adequately monitoring sales.
(Which U.S. agency is responsible for end-use checks depends on the type
of sale conducted.) The United States is the largest arms supplier to
Saudi Arabia and the UAE, two lucrative customers of the U.S. defense
industry. Saudi Arabia was the largest importer of U.S. arms, having
purchased \$112 billion in weapons from 2013 through 2017. The UAE was
the second-largest importer of U.S. arms in the same time span. Since
2009, over \$27 billion in weapons have been offered to the UAE in
thirty-two separate deals under the Pentagon's Foreign Military Sales
program. [These [arms sales continue, despite both countries' history of
diverting arms to favored militias]{.mark}. Saudi Arabia has been
purchasing weapons from third parties to pass on to allied governments
and groups]{.underline} at least since the 1970s, sometimes on behalf of
the U.S. government. Transparency International's Government Defense
Anti-Corruption Index ranks Saudi Arabia and the UAE in its high-risk
category for corruption, with Saudi Arabia receiving a score of zero out
of four (zero being the worst) and the UAE receiving a score of one for
lacking a well-scrutinized process for arms export decisions that aligns
with international protocols. Examples of Gulf States Diverting U.S.
Arms 1970s---Saudi Arabia financed U.S.-made hardware for the Afghan
Mujahideen 1980s---Saudi Arabia was a conduit for U.S. weapons to Iraq
and a financier of the Iran-Contra scandal More recently, Saudi Arabia
purchased weapons from Croatia and Bulgaria for Syrian anti-government
rebels---and some of these weapons ended up in the hands of the
self-proclaimed Islamic State 2014---Saudi Arabia financed \$2 billion
in Russian arms for Egypt's military-backed government [The [UAE has
been accused of shipping weapons to]{.mark} Libyan General Khalifa
[Haftar]{.mark} in violation of UN sanctions [and to]{.mark} various
[Syrian rebel groups]{.mark}.]{.underline} The CNN investigation comes
as Congress ramps up its opposition to U.S. support for the Saudi-led
coalition. Former U.S. president Barack Obama's administration only
reluctantly agreed to support the Saudi-led coalition as it went on the
offense in 2015, seeing it as an unwinnable proxy war against Iran.
Obama had put restrictions on arms sales and intelligence cooperation
with the coalition in 2016, but President Donald Trump's administration
lifted those restrictions in March 2017, just prior to Trump's overseas
visit to Saudi Arabia. [Saudi human rights abuses in Yemen using U.S.
weapons, such as the airstrike on a school bus in August 2018 that
killed forty children, and the murder of Khashoggi have shocked the U.S.
public and Congress.]{.underline} In the National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2018, Congress required the departments of Defense
and State to certify that the Saudi-led coalition was doing all it could
to prevent civilian casualties; the State Department failed to provide
that justification when it was due earlier this month. In December, the
Senate approved a measure to end arms shipments to Saudi Arabia, despite
the Trump administration's strong opposition to the bill. The measure
did not have enough votes to override a presidential veto, but senators
have promised to introduce an even tougher bill in 2019. Last week, the
House also passed a measure to end U.S. assistance to the Saudi-led
coalition in Yemen, but again without enough votes to override an
expected presidential veto. The Trump administration continues to
approve arms shipments to the Saudi coalition. In 2018 alone, the United
States directly sold \$4.4 billion in arms to Saudi Arabia, and the
administration approved the latest sale of Patriot missile upgrades in
December. Tens of billions of dollars in deals with Saudi Arabia remain
in the pipeline as well, awaiting approvals as part of the
controversial, alleged May 2017 \$110 billion arms deal with Saudi
Arabia. [The [Trump]{.mark} administration [has shown little inclination
to]{.mark} [loosen]{.mark} its close [ties]{.mark} with Saudi Arabia and
the UAE [despite the death of Khashoggi or]{.mark} the conduct of the
war in [Yemen]{.mark}. The monarchs of [Saudi Arabia and the UAE can
conduct]{.mark} these [proxy operations and divert equipment with no
oversight]{.mark} and almost no input from their own citizens. Both
countries are absolute monarchies, and their legislative bodies are
advisory and contain only regime-approved members. Both countries also
stamp out any free press and most independent civil society. Information
on defense policies, including the war in Yemen, is kept secret by the
monarchs and their inner circles.]{.underline} Most available
information on Saudi and Emirati coalition operations and weapons
transfers comes from external parties, such as U.S. government weapons
sales notifications, news organizations, and human rights organizations.
[[Given the lack of e]{.mark}ffective Saudi and Emirati citizen or
parliamentary o[versight]{.mark} on the conduct of the war in Yemen and
associated weapons transfers, [it is crucial that the United
States]{.mark} and other arms-exporting nations [conduct additional due
diligence and put controls on any exports]{.mark} to Saudi Arabia and
the UAE]{.underline}. The CNN investigation demonstrates that the
[stringent due diligence and accountability that should be required for
such sales has not been conducted.]{.underline} As the Trump
administration continues to approve arms sales, an emboldened Congress
inches ever closer---often across partisan lines---to cutting off those
very same sales.

## AT Oil Impacts

### AT: Oil -- SA Won't Cut Production

#### Saudi Arabia won't cut oil production\-\--they hate Iran and cutting production would do more harm to the Saudi economy

Andrew **Miller** 11/1/**18**, a nonresident scholar in Carnegie's
Middle East Program, \"Saudi Arabia's Empty Oil Threats\", Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace,
https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/11/01/saudi-arabia-s-empty-oil-threats-pub-77628

[While Saudi Arabia does have the ability to impose costs on the United
States if it is displeased by forceful action on the Khashoggi affair,
[Saudi threats to sabotage]{.mark} President [Trump's Iran policy
through manipulating the oil market do not appear credible]{.mark}, for
two primary reasons. First, Riyadh has been acutely sensitive to the
potential danger posed by its larger Persian Gulf neighbor for decades,
and the Saudi leadership has increasingly indicated that it perceives
Iran as an existential threat.]{.underline} Bin Salman has spoken of
Iran in stark terms, likening the Islamic Republic to Hitler and
accusing it of following an "extremist ideology."

Indeed, the crown prince has emphasized the urgency of the putative
Iranian threat, saying, "We are a primary target for the Iranian
regime," and suggesting that the kingdom "won't wait for the battle to
be in Saudi Arabia." Bin Salman's fixation on Iran is also evident in
his destructive bombing campaign against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in
Yemen, which has caused a humanitarian disaster and costs Saudi Arabia
at least \$50 billion per year. The crown prince appears intent on
continuing that war until Iranian influence is not just minimized or
contained but, as he reportedly told former Deputy Secretary of State
Tony Blinken, completely "eradicated."

[Saudi Arabia has spent years encouraging Washington to take more
aggressive action against Iran]{.underline}, including reportedly urging
then Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to initiate military action
against Tehran in 2010. [[Saudi support for]{.mark} the [Trump]{.mark}
administration['s]{.mark} [Iran campaign is not a favor to the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [but a reflection of Riyadh's]{.mark} own
authentic [anxiety regarding Iranian intentions. Saudi Arabia is]{.mark}
therefore highly [unlikely to]{.mark} take any step that would
deliberately [relieve pressure on Tehran and disrupt the]{.mark}
kingdom's [partnership with]{.mark} the [Trump]{.mark} administration
[to counter its regional rival]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The economic logic for Saudi intransigence is equally unconvincing.
Although [Saudi Arabia's use of the "oil weapon"]{.mark} would indeed
cause short-term harm to the U.S. and global economies, it
[would]{.mark} ultimately [do more harm to the Saudi economy]{.mark} in
the medium to long term.]{.underline} The reason for this is not that
the United States has achieved energy independence but that [Saudi
influence over the global oil market has been in steady decline. [A
major increase in]{.mark} the [price]{.mark} of oil [would lead]{.mark}
higher-cost producers of energy, such as [frackers]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
the [alternative energy]{.mark} industry, [to take advantage of a more
favorable market]{.mark} by producing more fuel. [The net effect
would]{.mark} be to [drive]{.mark} oil [prices]{.mark} back
[down]{.mark}, while at the same time [robbing Saudi Arabia of market
share]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Simply put, [Saudi Arabia would end up selling less oil at close to
present prices, which means it would lose revenue]{.underline}. The
kingdom is already suffering lower than expected revenues, such that it
has been forced to scale back services and benefits for its burgeoning
young population. With public debt surpassing 20 percent, Saudi Arabia
can ill afford to sacrifice additional oil-based revenue.

#### Saudi Arabia won't cut oil production\-\--it would hurt their own economy

**The Economist** 10/19/**18**, \"Is economic war looming between Saudi
Arabia and America?\",
https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/10/19/is-economic-war-looming-between-saudi-arabia-and-america

TRY as they might, [the rulers of Saudi Arabia cannot seem to make Jamal
Khashoggi go away.]{.underline} Quite the opposite. The journalist's
apparent murder, inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2nd,
has dragged the kingdom into its worst diplomatic crisis in years.
American politicians have spoken of sanctioning any Saudi officials
found culpable in Mr Khashoggi's murder. One senator even called for the
removal of the crown prince, Muhammad bin Salman. [The Saudis have
responded with uncharacteristic bluster. "[The kingdom]{.mark} also
[affirms]{.mark} that [if it receives any action, it will respond with
greater action]{.mark},]{.underline}" warned a statement from the
official news agency. [[But would it follow
through?]{.underline}]{.mark}

Any discussion of Saudi Arabia's economic clout starts with oil. It is
no longer the world's leading producer. America has pumped more of the
stuff this year. But [[Saudi Arabia is]{.mark} still [America's
second-biggest source of foreign oil]{.mark}]{.underline}, after Canada,
delivering 955,000 barrels per day, or 9% of total imports. Beyond that,
bilateral trade is limited. America exported \$16.3bn worth of goods to
Saudi Arabia in 2017, of which about \$3bn was weapons and ammunition.
Its non-oil imports from the kingdom were a mere \$900m. Those figures
are dwarfed, however, by Saudi investments in the United States. The
Public Investment Fund (PIF), Saudi Arabia's sovereign-wealth fund, has
poured \$4.9bn into American start-ups. Another Saudi-backed venture has
made at least \$17bn worth of deals. Banks have hauled in hundreds of
millions of dollars in fees for advising on Saudi projects like the
(now-stalled) public offering of Aramco, the state oil company.

[If the Saudis are serious about their threats, [they could halt all of
this---but they would hurt themselves]{.mark} in the process. Oil might
appear as a potent weapon]{.underline}. Venezuela is collapsing, and
next month America will reimpose sanctions on Iran's oil sector. [If
Saudi Arabia lowers output it could [drive prices]{.mark} well [above
\$100]{.mark} a barrel. But this [would throw a lifeline to]{.mark} its
regional nemesis. [Iran]{.mark} hopes [to dodge sanctions by offering
its oil at a discount. Higher prices would]{.mark} make this an
attractive option for big customers like India and Turkey. They would
also [boost American shale]{.mark}-oil [producers and investment in
renewable]{.mark} energy, both of which will ultimately drive prices
back down.]{.underline} Also unrealistic is the threat, voiced by a
journalist close to Prince Muhammad, to make Russia the main supplier of
arms to Saudi Arabia. The kingdom has spent decades buying kit from
America and other NATO members. Abandoning that policy requires new
supply chains, infrastructure and training---a long and expensive
process. Even curtailing investments in Silicon Valley would be
counterproductive. Saudi Arabia hopes its stakes in firms like Uber will
pay huge dividends for the PIF, which is Prince Muhammad's main vehicle
for overhauling the economy.

[None of this is to say the Saudis will not retaliate]{.underline}. By
now Prince Muhammad has a track record of impulsive, self-defeating
behaviour. [But [America has]{.mark} far [more leverage in this dispute.
The kingdom is desperate for]{.mark} both [foreign investment]{.mark}
and capital for the PIF. Its non-oil economy is sluggish, and the
unemployment rate for citizens is still rising. And there is one final
consideration: Donald Trump. The president complains often about the
price of oil and about states that do not buy or invest enough in
America for his liking. Mr Trump cares little about human rights. He
might be willing to overlook the murder of a journalist. Expensive
gasoline is a different story.]{.underline}

### AT: Oil -- US Production Solves

#### No impact to Saudi production cut\-\--US production provides a buffer

T. Boone **Pickens**, 3-20-20**18**, energy executive, What If Saudi
Arabia Slows Oil Output Over The Khashoggi Crisis? How The U.S. Should
Respond, Forbes,
https://www.forbes.com/sites/tboonepickens/2018/10/22/what-if-saudi-arabia-slows-their-oil-spigot-heres-a-two-fold-solution-for-the-u-s/#239eecc91431

For more than four decades, the Saudis have kept prices stable for the
U.S., even favoring us over Europe. Changing course overnight and
withholding supply would result in skyrocketing oil prices likely in the
\$150 a barrel range, causing a recession here at home. The Saudis
produce 10.5 million barrels a day, and are supposed to be increasing
that number to offset the 2 million barrels of Iranian oil we are
losing. In short, there is nobody to make up Saudi production. So,
[[what do we do if they slow the spigots?]{.underline}]{.mark}

[There is a two-fold solution, and it begins with [the]{.mark} Strategic
Petroleum Reserve ([SPR]{.mark}), [the largest emergency supply in the
world]{.mark}]{.underline} and one of the truly good investments by the
federal government. [It's [an untapped resource with]{.mark} almost [700
million barrels of oil.]{.mark}]{.underline}

It has only been used in emergencies three times, last in 2011, when
President Obama authorized the sale of 30 million barrels to offset
disruptions caused by unrest in Libya. More recently, the Trump
administration has acknowledged the value of the SPR and proposed
drawing down the SPR and selling to other countries.

Both were right to recognize the SPR as a strategic resource. [[It's our
way to weaponize oil]{.mark} ourselves, [allowing a buffer to free us
from the pressures of international energy crises]{.mark} of the kind we
now are threatened with.]{.underline}

[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should dip into the]{.mark} supply
kept in the [SPR to offset any drawback from the
Saudis]{.mark}.]{.underline} We should also be selling off some of that
supply, gradually, so as not to disrupt the market too drastically.

[The SPR is [an opportunity to bail our way out]{.mark} of this
potential energy emergency.]{.underline} But let this crisis remind us
about the broader purpose of the SPR -- to insulate the U.S. from risky
and unstable OPEC dependence -- and think about how we can achieve that
long-term goal.

Let this crisis be a wake-up call to take action and prevent ourselves
from similar crises in the future. As I have said since the earliest
days of the Pickens Plan in 2008, dependence on OPEC and its largest
exporter will continue to pose a national security threat unless America
has an all-American energy plan. The SPR can help get us there.

Should we begin selling off the SPR, the proceeds must be used to
further insulate us from OPEC, and from oil itself. [[This money can be
used to build an infrastructure within the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates to support true competition in the transportation fuels
marketplace by [encouraging the use of another American resource,
natural gas.]{.mark}]{.underline}

It's cleaner than diesel, cheaper, and it's all ours. Natural gas can
power near-zero emission engines in cars, trucks and buses. It's a
reliable fuel that can help us transition from diesel to the energies of
tomorrow. [[Funding its use]{.mark}, especially in the public and
private transportation, from cars to heavy-duty vehicles, [will put us
on the path to freedom from foreign threats.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Tapping into and selling off the SPR should be action item one to keep
blood flowing should the Saudis pinch the vein. In the meantime, we
should be bolstering that independence from OPEC oil by improving our
own energy infrastructure.

It takes a crisis to get things done -- so let this one be the last.

### 2AC---AT Oil Econ Impact 

#### No economic impact---US not dependent on Saudi oil, other tech investors, defense sector unimportant to economy

Heather **Hurlburt 18**, Writer for New York Magazine, 10/20/18, "The
U.S. Has Deep Ties to Saudi Arabia --- But Disentangling Ourselves Isn't
Impossible,"
http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/10/us-disentangle-saudi-ties-khashoggi.html

[[A]{.mark} popular American [stereotype is that the U.S. is dependent
on Saudi oil]{.mark}. [We're not. Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [accounts for 13
percent of]{.mark} global crude [oil production, while the U.S. produces
12 percent.]{.mark} While we're debunking outdated ideas, many Americans
--- including President Trump --- still believe that the Saudi-led
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) controls world
production and prices.]{.underline} While its members control about 40
percent of oil production, and 80 percent of proven petroleum deposits,
[[it has been decades since]{.mark} its [members have been able to agree
on measures]{.mark} stringent enough to inflict pain on developed
nations like the U.S. In fact, [in recent years]{.mark} the [Saudis
have]{.mark} usually [chosen to live with lower oil prices]{.mark} for
political reasons.]{.underline}

The economic truth is more complicated. An awful lot of the U.S. economy
is greased by Saudi money --- the oil industry, but also the assembly
lines making weapons the Saudis buy, or buy for others, and the Silicon
Valley firms where the Saudis are parking their oil money in
anticipation of a low-carbon future. Then there's the Washington
lobbying firms and think tanks that the Saudis and their Gulf allies
have invested in heavily.

But [like OPEC, the influence of Saudi money gets exaggerated awfully
fast]{.underline} --- and popular debate over Saudi doings can be quick
to take on a racist tinge.

Let's look at what Trump claims is a deal to supply \$110 billion worth
of weapons to Riyadh, maintaining profits and priceless manufacturing
jobs here in the U.S. CNN reports that, [18 months after the deal was
announced, the Saudis have only followed through on about one-eighth of
the purchases. Bloomberg crunches some numbers to point out that,
although the [Saudi]{.mark}s have been [weapons]{.mark} customers for
decades, their total [purchases]{.mark} of U.S. goods annually [are
dwarfed by ... Switzerland.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[And about those defense manufacturing jobs?]{.underline} They do
matter, tremendously, to the manufacturing communities where they are
clustered, the unions who represent the well-paid workers, and members
of Congress in states like Ohio, Missouri and Washington. [Overall,
though, [the entire]{.mark} private sector [defense industry represents
.5 percent of]{.mark} U.S. [employment.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[In recent years, the Saudis' heavy investment [in Silicon
Valley]{.mark} has led some observers to warn that the same government
that apparently killed one of its own citizens on foreign soil could
decide to turn the screws on the U.S. high-tech industry. But in fact,
[for every dollar the Saudis want to pull out, there's still]{.mark} an
American, Chinese or [other global investor's]{.mark} dollar [eager to
get in.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 2AC\-\-- No Oil Weapon 

#### Saudi Arabia won't wield the oil weapon---too much to lose

John **Kemp 18**, Reuters market analyst, 10/16/18, "The real reason we
have nothing to fear from Saudi Arabia's 'oil weapon',"
https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/column-saudi-arabias-oil-weapon-doesnt-work-kemp

[[Experience from the last time Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [tried to use
oil]{.mark} sales [as a diplomatic instrument]{.mark} in 1973/74
[shows]{.mark} such action does not work and [the kingdom]{.mark} itself
[would be the biggest victim.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Despite some of the impassioned rhetoric in Saudi media, self-interest
makes it improbable the government will retaliate by reducing oil sales
or trying to drive up prices.]{.underline}

That has not stopped some veiled threats to weaponize oil production and
prices, but they should be interpreted as an urgent plea for support and
understanding rather than a serious threat.

"If U.S. sanctions are imposed on Saudi Arabia, we will be facing an
economic disaster that would rock the entire world," according to

one heated editorial.

"Riyadh is the capital of (global) oil and touching this would affect
oil production before any other vital commodity," the editorial warned.

If the price of oil reaching US\$80 a barrel angered U.S. President
Donald Trump, "no one should rule out the price jumping to US\$100, or
US\$200, or even double that figure," the author said bluntly.

The government's official response has been more circumspect but it
nonetheless warned that it would respond to any action with even greater
retaliation and pointed to the kingdom's "influential and vital role in
the global economy."

OIL EMBARGO

[[In]{.mark} October 19[73, Saudi]{.mark} Arabia and the other Arab oil
producers [announced that they would]{.mark} [start cutting
production]{.mark} by 5 per cent per month until Israeli forces
evacuated from occupied Arab territories.]{.underline}

[In addition, Saudi Arabia and the other Arab producers announced an
embargo on oil sales to the United States and a number of other
countries.]{.underline}

Global oil supplies had already become tight even before the decisions
to cut production and embargo the United States, mostly as a result of
low real prices during the 1950 and 1960s.

Spare production capacity in the United States, which had been as much
as 4 million barrels per day in 1968, had been used up by March 1972.

[In this context, the production cuts and embargo made an already tight
market worse, sent oil prices surging, and produced a huge, short-term
revenue windfall for Saudi Arabia and other oil producers.]{.underline}

[But [the policy was a failure]{.mark} in its own terms, was reversed a
few months later, [and caused immense]{.mark} long-term [damage to Saudi
Arabia and OPEC]{.mark} that took decades to reverse.]{.underline}

POLICY FAILURE

[At the most basic level, the policy failed to achieve its stated
objective of changing U.S. support for Israel or forcing Israel to
withdraw from the occupied Palestinian territories.]{.underline}

[More seriously for Saudi Arabia and other Arab oil producers, [the
surge in prices]{.mark}, which rose again after the Iranian revolution
in 1979, [resulted in permanent demand destruction a]{.mark}nd
encouragement of alternative suppliers.]{.underline}

[Rising prices helped spur the development of new supplies in Alaska,
the North Sea, the Soviet Union and China, which came onstream and
flooded the oil market in the 1980s.]{.underline}

[[Rising prices also encouraged a]{.mark} wholesale [switch away
from]{.mark} the use of crude [oil]{.mark} and heavy fuel oil in
residential and commercial heating boilers as well as in power
generation.]{.underline}

[Homes and offices in the United States and many other advanced
economies switched from heavy fuel oil to cheaper and more reliable
heating using natural gas or electricity generated from coal or
nuclear.]{.underline}

[Crude oil and fuel oil were replaced by a new generation of coal-fired
power plants in the United States in the late 1970s and the 1980s
(ironically the same coal plants that are now being closed and replaced
by natural gas).]{.underline}

[The oil shock also provided the impetus to develop a new generation of
nuclear power plants in the United States, France, Japan, Britain and
other countries to reduce the reliance on imported crude.]{.underline}

Cheap oil had been on the way to becoming the dominant fuel for power
generation in the 1950s and 1960s, putting the coal industry under
pressure.

By the late 1980s, however, expensive and unreliable oil had been
largely pushed out of the power sector by cheaper and more secure coal,
gas and nuclear, a permanent loss of markets from which it has never
recovered.

Policymakers in the United States, Europe and Japan also enacted new
fuel-economy standards for motor vehicles to reduce reliance on imports
for the transport sector, taking another enduring bite out of demand.

[In the long term, the oil embargo created the conditions for the oil
price slump that hit Saudi Arabia and other producers in the 1980s and
1990s, and from which they did not recover until the 2000s.]{.underline}

WEAPON MALFUNCTION

[[The oil weapon]{.mark} does not work]{.underline}, which is why Saudi
Arabia is unlikely to employ it in the dispute over the disappearance of
Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

In the short term, Saudi Arabia might gain more revenue from a rise in
prices than it lost from a reduction in sales. But rising prices would
hit the global economy and consumption hard and threaten a renewed oil
market slump within a year.

[The weapon [cannot be wielded in a targeted way]{.mark} against
specific consuming countries [because the oil market is global]{.mark}
and fully integrated. Restricting supplies to punish some countries
pushes up oil prices for all consumers.]{.underline}

[[Wielding]{.mark} the [oil]{.mark} weapon [to pressure the United
States would impose bigger costs on China and India,]{.mark} [which are
the largest]{.mark} and fastest-growing oil [importers]{.mark} and
crucial markets for the future.]{.underline}

[Saudi Arabia has spent decades marketing itself as a reliable oil
supplier, especially to customers in Asia, and [any attempt to employ
the oil weapon would destroy]{.mark} that [carefully crafted
reputation]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Saudi Arabia's [refining customers would instead turn to Iran, Russia
and the United States for additional supplies]{.mark} and likely
reconsider their long-term dependence on the kingdom.]{.underline}

If Saudi Arabia nonetheless attempted to weaponize oil production and
sales, the resulting surge in prices would prompt another round of
conservation measures cutting long-term demand for its main product.

[[Sharp rises in]{.mark} oil [prices would put a renewed focus
on]{.mark} vehicle [fuel economy standards]{.mark} as well as
accelerating the deployment of electric vehicles.]{.underline}

[Rising prices and concerns about unreliable supplies would speed the
diffusion of electric vehicles and push oil out of the transport market
just as it was pushed out of heating and power generation in the
1980s.]{.underline}

### 1AR\-\-- No Oil Weapon 

#### Embargo would fail today---no Arab oil producer support and alternative energy sources

Nabeel **Khoury 18**, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic
Council's Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East, 10/23/19, "Oil, Arms,
and Counterterrorism: A Look At Saudi Options and How Far the Kingdom
May Go,"
[[https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/oil-arms-and-counterterrorism-a-look-at-saudi-options-and-how-far-the-kingdom-may-go]{.underline}](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/oil-arms-and-counterterrorism-a-look-at-saudi-options-and-how-far-the-kingdom-may-go)

[[The only successful]{.mark} use of an [oil embargo]{.mark} as a weapon
[occurred in 1973]{.mark}, following the October War between Egypt and
Syria on the one hand and Israel on the other. The Arab members of the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) used an oil
embargo to target the United States and Western Europe for supporting
Israel.]{.underline}

The embargo held for only four months but produced a shockwave in the
United States and Western Europe. Long lines formed at gas stations.
This was followed by considerably higher oil prices, which at first
doubled and then doubled again never going back to the pre-1973 levels.

In the short term, the embargo motivated the Nixon administration to
pressure the Israelis---through Henry Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy---to
withdraw from territories seized in the war.

[[The long-term impact]{.mark}, however, [did not]{.mark} necessarily
[favor]{.mark} the Arab [oil producers]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Israel
never pulled back]{.mark} to the pre-1967 borders, as most Arab
countries had demanded, [and]{.mark} the [Nixon]{.mark} administration
[announced a]{.mark} new energy [strategy to boost domestic oil
production]{.mark} in order to reduce US dependence on oil imports.
These measures included the creation of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve,
a national 55-mile-per-hour speed limit on US highways, and later, an
imposition of fuel economy standards that have grown more stringent over
the years.]{.underline}

[[An oil embargo would be]{.mark} difficult, if not [impossible, to pull
off today]{.mark}. [Iran, Qatar, and Iraq]{.mark}, for a start, [would
not]{.mark} necessarily [go along]{.mark} with such a policy, nor would
they accept Saudi leadership in any confrontation with the
West.]{.underline}

[[Russian oil exports]{.mark}, which were not a factor in 1973, [have
increased dramatically]{.mark} and would today counteract any reduction
in the oil flow from the Gulf.]{.underline}

[To boot, [the United States and Europe are working on replacing oil
with other forms of energy]{.mark}. An embargo would only speed the
process of weaning modern economies off oil.]{.underline}

#### No oil weapon---hurts campaign against Iran and Saudi economy 

Andrew **Miller and** Sahar **Nowrouzzadeh 18**, Andrew Miller is a
nonresident scholar at Carnegie's Middle East program and Sahar
Nowrouzzadeh is a research fellow at Harvard Kennedy School Belfer
Center for Science and International Affairs, 11/1/18, "Saudi Arabia's
Empty Oil Threats,"
https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/11/01/saudi-arabia-s-empty-oil-threats-pub-77628

[Administration officials reportedly worry that by applying too much
pressure on the kingdom, they could inadvertently "jeopardize plans to
enlist Saudi help to avoid disrupting the oil market."]{.underline} The
Trump administration has been counting on Saudi Arabia, as the world's
swing producer, to increase its oil production to help offset the
anticipated loss of Iranian supply come November 5, when sanctions
lifted under the Iran nuclear deal are re-imposed.

U.S. officials reportedly fear that an offended Saudi Arabia could
undermine this plan by refusing to increase its oil production---or even
cutting production (to spite its face). Such action would likely cause a
dramatic spike in global oil prices. The American people would be forced
to pay more for fuel; European countries displeased with the U.S.
withdrawal from the nuclear deal would have further incentive to subvert
sanctions; and Iran would enjoy greater revenues from whatever oil it
could still sell. This chain of events would pose a fundamental
challenge to President Trump's entire plan for confronting Iran, of
which a key component is ramping up economic pressure in an attempt to
alter Tehran's policies.

Elements of the Saudi monarchy are well aware of the administration's
fixation on Iran and seem to want to stoke these fears. In an October 14
statement, the official Saudi Press Agency alluded to the so-called "oil
weapon," reminding the United States that "the kingdom's economy has an
influential and vital role in the global economy." The general manager
of the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya news network went even further,
threatening that the kingdom would reconcile with Iran in response to
U.S. pressure and warning, "If the price of oil reaching \$80 angered
President Trump, no one should rule out the price jumping to \$100, or
\$200, or even double that figure."

[While Saudi Arabia does have the ability to impose costs on the United
States if it is displeased by forceful action on the Khashoggi affair,
[Saudi threats to sabotage]{.mark} President Trump's [Iran policy
through]{.mark} manipulating [the oil market do not appear
credible]{.mark}, for two primary reasons. First, Riyadh has been
acutely sensitive to the potential danger posed by its larger Persian
Gulf neighbor for decades, and the [Saudi leadership has]{.mark}
increasingly [indicated that it perceives Iran as an existential
threat.]{.mark} Bin Salman has spoken of Iran in stark terms, likening
the Islamic Republic to Hitler and accusing it of following an
"extremist ideology."]{.underline}

Indeed, the crown prince has emphasized the urgency of the putative
Iranian threat, saying, "We are a primary target for the Iranian
regime," and suggesting that the kingdom "won't wait for the battle to
be in Saudi Arabia." Bin Salman's fixation on Iran is also evident in
his destructive bombing campaign against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in
Yemen, which has caused a humanitarian disaster and costs Saudi Arabia
at least \$50 billion per year. The crown prince appears intent on
continuing that war until Iranian influence is not just minimized or
contained but, as he reportedly told former Deputy Secretary of State
Tony Blinken, completely "eradicated."

[Saudi Arabia has spent years encouraging Washington to take more
aggressive action against Iran, including reportedly urging then
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to initiate military action against
Tehran in 2010. [Saudi support for]{.mark} the [Trump]{.mark}
administration's [Iran campaign is]{.mark} not a favor to the United
States but [a reflection of Riyadh's]{.mark} [own]{.mark} authentic
[anxiety]{.mark} regarding Iranian intentions. [Saudi Arabia is]{.mark}
therefore highly [unlikely to take any step that would deliberately
relieve pressure on Tehran and disrupt the]{.mark} kingdom's
[partnership with]{.mark} the [Trump]{.mark} administration to counter
its regional rival.]{.underline}

[The economic logic for Saudi intransigence is equally unconvincing.
Although Saudi Arabia's use of [the "oil weapon]{.mark}" would indeed
cause short-term harm to the U.S. and global economies, it
[would]{.mark} ultimately [do more harm to the Saudi economy]{.mark} in
the medium to long term. The reason for this is not that the United
States has achieved energy independence but that [Saudi influence over
the global oil market has been in]{.mark} steady [decline. A major
increase in the price of oil would lead higher-cost producers]{.mark} of
energy, such as frackers and the alternative energy industry, [to take
advantage]{.mark} of a more favorable market [by producing more
fuel]{.mark}. The net effect would be to drive oil prices back down,
while at the same time robbing Saudi Arabia of market
share.]{.underline}

[Simply put, Saudi Arabia would end up selling less oil at close to
present prices, which means it would lose revenue. [The kingdom is
already suffering lower than expected revenues,]{.mark} such that it has
been forced to scale back services and benefits for its burgeoning young
population. With public debt surpassing 20 percent, Saudi Arabia can ill
afford to sacrifice additional oil-based revenue.]{.underline}

#### Saudi threats are empty---economy is too dependent on the US

Ellen **Wald 18**, the author of "Saudi, Inc.: The Arabian Kingdom's
Pursuit of Profit and Power.", 10/18/19, "Saudi Arabia has No Leverage,"
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/opinion/saudi-arabia-economy-united-states.html

These are empty threats. [Saudi Arabia is not in a position to harm the
United States. In fact, when it comes to relations between the United
States and Saudi Arabia, [Washington has all of the leverage]{.mark}.
American policymakers shouldn't forget that. One of Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman's primary objectives is to diversify the Saudi
economy and wean his country off its dependence on oil. Unemployment in
Saudi Arabia is at more than 12 percent, and some 70 percent of employed
Saudis work for the government. The [Saudi l]{.mark}abor ministry
[estimates that the economy needs to create 1.2 million jobs]{.mark} by
2022 [to lower unemployment to]{.mark} a still dismal [9
percent]{.mark}. But because the country lacks business experience and
special expertise outside of the oil and petrochemical industries, [that
won't be possible without]{.mark} foreign --- and particularly [American
--- participation]{.mark}. That's why the Saudis have been making so
many deals recently: The Public Investment Fund has partnered with AMC
to open and run movie theaters across the country because AMC knows how
to manage cinemas. Saudi Arabia is pursuing deals for Snap and Amazon to
open facilities in the kingdom because they can offer tech
opportunities. It's not just the private sector. [The Saudi
government]{.mark} bureaucracy also [relies heavily on American
management expertise]{.mark}. Riyadh has been hiring American
consultants since the 1950s, and in recent years American firms like
McKinsey, Boston Consulting Group and Oliver Wyman have worked on
hundreds of projects for the kingdom. In some cases, Saudi government
bureaucrats work side by side with these consultants to implement
government programs. [The Saudi Public Investment Fund]{.mark} --- the
kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, which is estimated to have more than
\$250 billion in assets --- [is]{.mark} also [closely tied to the
American economy]{.mark}.]{.underline} To name just a few of its major
investments: It put \$3.5 billion into Uber in 2016 and almost half a
billion dollars in the start-up Magic Leap this year; it invested \$45
billion in SoftBank's Vision Fund, which invests heavily in American
technology start-ups; and it made a \$5 billion investment with a
possible growth to \$20 billion in a Blackstone fund for United States
infrastructure. [Much of the tens of billions of dollars cannot be
pulled out on a whim. These start-ups are private companies without open
markets for their shares. Prince [Mohammed is building a domestic
reputation with]{.mark} this [tech]{.mark} portfolio, [so its success is
politically important]{.mark}, too. All of this is at risk if the
dispute worsens between Saudi Arabia and the United States over Mr.
Khashoggi's disappearance. [Not only could the Saudis not retaliate
because their economy is so intertwined]{.mark} with that of the United
States, [but they will also be susceptible to pressure]{.mark}. Targeted
sanctions --- if it comes to that --- could force consultants to
withdraw or cut off the Saudi Public Investment Fund's access to the
profits of its investments. More likely, though, is that a continuing
dispute would force American businesses like AMC to seriously reconsider
involvement in the country because of negative publicity. What about
oil? Whereas Saudi Arabia could once shock the world economy by cutting
oil exports or production to raise prices, it no longer has that power.
[The oil market today is]{.mark} significantly more [diverse]{.mark}
than it was in 1973, when Saudi Arabia and other Arab petroleum
exporters unilaterally raised the price of oil and unsettled the
American economy. In fact, [the United States now produces more oil than
Saudi Arabia,]{.mark} and imports make up a smaller percentage of
domestically refined crude oil. Saudi Arabia cannot embargo or
unilaterally raise oil prices for the United States without doing
greater harm to its own industry and revenues. [If Riyadh
directed]{.mark} the national oil company, Saudi [Aramco, to halt
exports]{.mark} to the United States today, [it would primarily
hurt]{.mark} Aramco [itself]{.mark}.]{.underline} Aramco owns Motiva,
the largest refinery in the United States, and Motiva is more reliant on
Saudi oil than any other part of America's energy ecosystem. [If Aramco
tried to raise prices by cutting oil production or exports, it would
face irate customers in Asia and hurt its own refineries in China and
Korea, too.]{.underline}

<https://www.defenseworld.net/news/25004/No_THAAD_Sytems_to_Saudi_As_US_Senate_Blocks__8_Billion_Arms_Sales_To_Riyadh#.XQ8cJcpOmfA>

[[Saudi Arabia will not be able to acquire]{.mark} the Terminal High
Altitude Area Defense ([THAAD]{.mark}) missile defense systems as
[the]{.mark} United States (US) [senate]{.mark} has [blocked \$8 Billion
arms sales to Riyadh]{.mark} and its allies, owing to their interference
in the Yemen conflict.]{.underline}

[[The Republican]{.mark}-led [Senate joined the Democrats in a]{.mark}
symbolic [rebuke to]{.mark} President Donald [Trump]{.mark} who had
claimed earlier this year that \"emergency\" circumstances require
Washington to provide Riyadh with more precision-guided bombs because of
Iranian threats.]{.underline} This is the first time the Senate has
advanced legislation to block arms sales, after two failed attempts to
block separate sales to Riyadh in 2016 and 2017.

Total arms sales by the US to Saudi Arabia, UAE and its Gulf allies have
amounted to over \$ 20 Billion in 2019 alone. Most of these arms have
been bought by members of the Coalition against the Iran-backed Houthi
rebels and for restoring 'legitimacy' in Yemen.

[[The blockade will deviate arms sales to Saudi Arabia]{.mark} and

systems]{.mark} and related support, to Riyadh.]{.underline}

According to a report published by The New York Times on June 7,
Trump\'s administration is allowing Raytheon to work with Saudi to
manufacture control systems, circuit cards, and guidance electronics
used to make smart bombs.

The UAE however managed to secure a \$353 deal with Raytheon for Patriot
missiles during the IDEX-2019 exhibition.

[Trump\'s administration in May of this year bypassed Congress's
approval to give a go-ahead to the arms procurement when the president
used emergency authority to approve 22 contracts]{.underline} that
include the sale of mortar bombs, missiles, drones, repair and
maintenance services, and precision-guided munitions to Saudi and the
UAE.

### 2AC- S-400 NU

#### Demand for Russian arms increasing, and many see the S-400 as preferable to THAAD already

**TRT World 19**, A Turkish International News Channel, 2/22/19, "Russia
is selling more weapons to Saudi Arabia and the UAE,"
https://www.trtworld.com/middle-east/russia-is-selling-more-weapons-to-saudi-arabia-and-the-uae-24431

[Ever since the beginning of its intervention in Syria, [Russia's
engagement with the Middle East has been]{.mark} steadily [on the
rise.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Syria offered the Russian military a priceless opportunity: a
conventional testing ground for its defence industry.]{.underline}

[Since then, interest in Russian defence offerings has only
grown.]{.underline}

Alexander Mikheyev, CEO of Russian defence firm Rosoboronexport admitted
as much, while speaking to TASS, the Russian state-owned news agency.

\"The demand is rather significant after Syria's events,\" he said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has also taken the same line.

"Syria is not a shooting range for Russian weapons, but we are still
using them there, our new weapons," Putin said.

"This has led to the improvement of modern strike systems, including
missile systems. It is one thing to have them, and quite another thing
to see how they fare in combat conditions," clarified the Russian
president.

New Milestones

[But this year, Russian [defence exports have reached new heights of
exposure]{.mark}, making a splash at the International Defence
Exhibition and Conference (IDEX), the Middle East's largest defence
summit, held annually in the United Arab Emirates.]{.underline}

[IDEX has always been a key event for defence companies around the
world, but is increasingly vital to Russian weapons manufacturers in
recent years, as sanctions slowly restrict their access to American and
European markets. Where can they make up for lost business? Among the
oil-rich deserts of the Middle East.]{.underline}

More than 50 Russian companies are presenting their wares at IDEX this
year.

Sergey Chemezov, CEO of Rostec Corporation told the Russian Tass news
agency: "For us, Middle Eastern and North African countries are
extremely important markets where we implement numerous projects both in
the civilian sector and in defence."

"In total, about 1,000 exhibits will be on display," he confirmed.

Last year, Russian companies took up nearly 1,400 square meters of space
to showcase their products.

The Middle East isn't the only place where there's money to be made for
Russia, although it may be the most profitable. Other notable markets
include China, India, Vietnam and Indonesia.

This year, the Middle East's leaders and generals will see new defence
offerings, beyond the usual Su-35 and MiG-29 fighter jets, small arms
and tanks usually pushed by Russia.

Foremost amongst them is the Pantsir-ME shipborne air defence missile
and artillery system, which was demonstrated during IDEX 2019. Its
specifications, if accurate, are impressive.

The Pantsir-ME can be mounted on any ship displacing more than 300
tonnes, featuring agile missile complements and two high-velocity
machine guns. The system is unique in that it can be used to cheaply
upgrade any fleet, offering an all-in-one offensive and defensive fire
package.

The system can be used autonomously, or as part of a network throughout
a vessel. It can also be installed on smaller corvettes, frigates, or
destroyers.

A Russian statement claims that the system missile complement can
simultaneously fire at four targets with a distance of 20 kilometres and
a ceiling of 15 kilometres.

If they miss the first time, Russia claims "the target will be hit by
artillery fire with a 100 percent guarantee".

How? With a "completely automated" learning process that includes target
acquisition, aiming, and firing.

The advertised fire-and-forget features are undoubtedly attractive to
third-world militaries who already face the high-bar of difficulty that
comes with creating a navy without the naval traditions and experiences
established navies benefit from.

Other Russian offerings include the AK-47, a common sight in Middle
Eastern conflicts due to its low cost and ruggedness, since updated with
the new AK200, a sleeker, modern variant.

[Russia is currently the second-largest arms supplier
worldwide.]{.underline}

In 2018, Rostec and its subsidiary, Rosoboronexport, supplied arms and
military equipment to over 40 countries worldwide, amounting to a total
of \$20 billion in trade.

The Middle East and North Africa alone were responsible for more than 40
percent of Rosoboronexport's business. This is up from 20 percent only
two years prior.

[The Middle East's appetite for arms has definitely increased.
Currently, the region leads the world by purchased volume of weapons,
making up nearly one-third of the global market.]{.underline}

Saudi Arabia looks towards Russia

Saudi Arabia, Israel, Egypt, the UAE and Qatar are on the top of the
list major defence buyers. Saudi Arabia remains the top importer,
responsible for a growing share of business with Russia.

[According to Rostec's CEO, [Saudi Arabia is]{.mark} currently [in talks
with]{.mark} Russia [to purchase]{.mark} the [S400]{.mark} missile
systems.]{.underline}

[This came following a bilateral agreement reached during a visit by
Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz to Moscow in October 2017, marking the
first visit by a Saudi monarch to Russia.]{.underline}

[Russia's Sputnik also reported that [Saudi Arabia would finalise a deal
to domestically produce Russian]{.mark} Kalashnikov [rifles]{.mark} by
the end of February 2019.]{.underline}

Militarisation in the UAE

Russia's biggest client this year was none other than the UAE.

It signed defence deals to acquire more than \$5.4 billion in arms and
military equipment during the IDEX conference, in spite of ongoing calls
to end the war in Yemen, in which the UAE plays a leading role.

At least \$1.9 billion was allocated to deals with US firms Lockheed
Martin and Raytheon to purchase air defence missiles, according to a
Reuters report.

Rosoboronexport Director General Alexander Mikheev told reporters that
Russia had received a request from the UAE to modernise its Pantsir-S1
systems.

This is in addition to a separate purchase of Russian Kornet-E anti-tank
missile systems worth \$40 million, according to a statement by UAE
Brigadier General Mohammed Al Hassani.

The Kornet was a favourite of armed militias and insurgents as far back
as the 1990s, seeing heavy use in Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq and most
notably Yemen. The rockets are prized for their ease of use, and for
giving light infantry the ability to stand up to heavy armour and
conventional armies.

"Emirati forces receive billions of dollars' worth of arms from Western
states and others, only to siphon them off to militias in Yemen that
answer to no-one and are known to be committing war crimes,\" noted
Patrick Wilcken, arms control researcher at Amnesty International.

Bilateral ties between the two countries however, have only seen steady
improvement in recent years.

On the same day the deals were declared, Russia announced visas on
arrival for Emirati passport holders, and further announced through
Tass, Russia's state media agency, that the Russian Direct Investment
Fund (RDIF) had reached \$2 billion in 2019 from Saudi Arabian and
Emirati investments, with the number only expected to rise.

This is in addition to bilateral cooperation agreements from late 2018
between Russia and the UAE on areas of cybersecurity, artificial
intelligence, and the creation of a Russian industrial zone in Egypt,
based on an agreement dating to 2014.

Only six months earlier, the UAE reached an agreement with Russia to
send its first astronaut into space, as part of a bid to kickstart its
envisioned space industry.

'Overstated' technology

[The US Patriot Missile system, a defensive platform, has come under
fire for an overstated effectiveness record. The US Patriot missile is
often touted as the US equivalent to the Russian S400 and S500 missile
platforms.]{.underline}

During the 1991 Gulf War, defence officials stated that the Patriot
Missile had a near-perfect record, intercepting 45 out of 47 incoming
Scud missiles.

[This was later revised to about 50 percent, and even then noting
'higher' confidence in only about 25 percent of cases.]{.underline}

[Investigations conducted by the congressional research service found
that if the US army had consistently and accurately applied its
assessment method, the number would be far lower. Reportedly, this
number was one Scud missile shot down.]{.underline}

[Following a House Committee on Government Operations investigation, not
enough evidence was available to support any interceptions at
all.]{.underline}

"[There is little evidence to prove that the Patriot hit more than a few
Scud missiles launched by Iraq during the Gulf War,\" the investigations
concluded.]{.underline}

[\"There are some doubts about even these engagements,\" it
added.]{.underline}

'Outperforming' technology

[[Middle Eastern countries are coming to view Russian missile platforms
as alternatives to]{.mark} their more expensive, and []{.mark}often
[less effective American counterparts]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to
Egyptian Brigadier General Samir Ragheb, President of the Arab
Foundation for Development and Strategic Studies, speaking to German
broadcaster DW.

[\"There is no doubt that this Russian system outperforms the Patriot
system in range and ability to deal with targets in a small orbit, and
its ability to launch multiple missiles]{.underline},\" Ragheb said.

[In this respect, the S400 may present a challenge to the US Patriot
Missile system which is widely used by NATO, given its greater range and
ability to double as both an offensive and defensive
platform.]{.underline}

## THAAD Bad

### 2AC---Crisis Instability Turn 

#### US BMD sales embolden Iran and cause a Middle Eastern arms race

Aaron **Stein 19**, the Director of the Middle East Program and a 2019
Templeton Fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, 1/24/19,
"Middle East Missile Race: The Missile Defense Review, Iran, and the
Implications for the Gulf,"
https://www.fpri.org/article/2019/01/middle-east-missile-race-the-missile-defense-review-iran-and-the-implications-for-the-gulf/

[[The proliferation of]{.mark} [b]{.mark}allistic [m]{.mark}issile
[d]{.mark}efense [has prompted Iranian countermoves]{.mark}, designed to
ensure that its missiles can defeat U.S.-made defenses.]{.underline} To
do so, Iran is pursuing four distinct approaches. [First, [Tehran is
investing in more]{.mark} short- and medium-range [missiles,
which]{.mark} when fired in large numbers [would overwhelm]{.mark} and
defeat [the]{.mark} comparatively smaller [number of]{.mark} missile
defense [systems deployed]{.mark}. Second, [Iran is experimenting
with]{.mark} creative and asymmetric [approaches to attack missile
defense radars,]{.mark} including with low-tech, off-the-shelf drones
that have reportedly been used in Yemen to target Patriot radars. Third,
recent imagery from a Qiam missile launch in September 2018 shows small
fins at the base of the re-entry vehicle, which could possibly indicate
an interest in developing some late-stage maneuvering capabilities to
defeat terminal missile defense, or, at the very least, to improve
stability and increase precision. Finally, the Islamic Republic remains
interested in the further development of cruise missiles. These missiles
fly low to the ground and, therefore, pose a challenge for missile
defenses designed to track and engage targets flying a ballistic
trajectory.]{.underline}

[[There are also indications that Iran is more confident using its
ballistic missiles.]{.underline}]{.mark} [In June 2017, Iran fired 6
missiles at targets in Syria, two, of which, the solid-fuel Zolfaqhar
missile, hit impact points in Mayadeen, a small town the Islamic State
formerly held in eastern Syria.]{.underline} To monitor battle damage,
and then for propaganda purposes, Iran filmed the impacts with a
Shahed-129 drone deployed in Syria, as part of the Iranian support given
to the Syrian regime. [Following the strike in Syria, Iran used
ballistic missiles to strike the headquarters of the Kurdistan
Democratic Party of Iran (KDP-I) in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The
Islamic Republic has also transferred the Qiam ballistic missile to the
Houthis in Yemen and has struck targets throughout the Kingdom,
including Riyadh.]{.underline}

[The war in Yemen has underscored the difficulty of finding and
targeting mobile missiles before they are launched. [The
Saudi]{.mark}-led [coalition has]{.mark} the [tools to search for
missiles]{.mark} on the ground, [but]{.mark} the [Houthis have still
managed to fire]{.mark} Qiam missiles [at least eight times]{.mark}
since July 2017 [without being detected]{.mark} from the
air.]{.underline} Despite these challenges, it is important for the
defender to include counterforce, specifically the ability to target
missiles before they are launched, in the broader effort to defend
against missile attack. For Iran, the lessons-lessons-learned from the
first Gulf War, when the United States dedicated considerable resources
(albeit with limited success) to find and attack Iraqi Scud missiles
before they were launched, probably informed thinking about future
missile development. Despite the challenges the U.S. faced in actually
finding Iraqi Scuds, investments to ensure that missiles remain
survivable from detection and air attack in the future, when U.S.
sensors and capabilities are certain to improve, probably drove Iranian
interests in fielding a more mobile missile force.

In the late-1990s, the Emirati Air Force purchased the Franco-British
air-launched cruise missile SCALP/Storm Shadow for Mirage and Tornado
aircraft---a useful weapon to target air defense sites and to hit
targets of convenience at long range. Following the Emirati purchase,
Saudi Arabia purchased the same missile in the mid-2000s. As Jeffrey
Lewis noted, the United States objected to the sale of the missile to
the UAE in the 1990s because it violated the voluntary guidelines under
the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), which established a common
presumption against the export of missiles capable of carrying a 500 kg
payload to more than 300 km. The United States was less vocal in its
criticism of the Saudi purchase, but that appears to be linked to the
fact that the United Kingdom kept the sale under wraps and never talked
much about it.

However, [as is the case with the spread of missile defense, it appears
as if [the spread of]{.mark} more accurate cruise [missiles]{.mark} for
countries in the Gulf h[as sparked an Iranian counter,]{.mark} focused
on the development of solid-fueled missiles. This fuel type is more
operationally flexible than liquid fuel because solid-fueled missiles
can be stored and transported fully fueled without the larger supporting
infrastructure needed to fire liquid-fueled missiles.]{.underline} One
benefit, of course, is that the aerial signature for solid-fueled
missiles is much smaller, which makes them harder to hit before launch.
[[Iran's interests]{.mark} in solid-fueled missiles]{.underline}, like
the Zolfaqhar, [[may be indicative of the missile race in the
region]{.mark}, wherein each side's effort to counter the other prompts
further technological developments to offset any advantage.]{.underline}

[As the United States develops strategies for regional missile defense,
and announces plans in the MDR about how to use missile defense to
enhance partnerships with regional allies, it is worth noting how the
Islamic Republic has responded to incremental American changes in
strategy. [Rather than try to overcome U.S. technological dominance,
Iran is using low-cost means to counter]{.mark} sophisticated
[defenses]{.mark} and developing missiles to try to evade ever-more
capable precision-guided weapons and sophisticated sensors.]{.underline}
[[This is certain to continue, given]{.mark} that the Gulf Arab element
of the MDR repeats [the]{.mark} long-standing [American effort to make
regional defenses more capable]{.mark}]{.underline}---an entirely
reasonable strategy, but one destined to invite countermoves by Iran.
Over the longer term, the importance of missiles for national
defense---whether for offense or defense---shows little signs of
abating. Instead, recent events in Iran and the Gulf underscore how
important missiles are becoming for a wide swathe of countries'
self-defined national security priorities[. [These dynamics point to a
near-term missile race]{.mark} in the Middle East, [an outcome that
could further destabilize a region]{.mark} rife with
conflict.]{.underline}

### 1AR---Crisis Instability 

#### Expansion of BMD causes adversary buildup and an arms race 

Boris **Toucas 17**, a visiting fellow with the Europe Program at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, 10/2017, "Ballistic
Missile Defense: Proceed with Caution,"
https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2017-11/features/ballistic-missile-defense-proceed-caution#endnotebio

[The aim is to enhance the overall security of the United States and its
allies in a world of increasing ballistic missile threats. Yet, that
appealing goal may be jeopardized if the process is driven primarily by
technological advances and business interests and without adequate
political vision and consideration of the implications for strategic
stability. Absent such safeguards, this evolution may lead to increased
strategic instability as other countries seek to counter U.S.
developments.]{.underline} Alternatively, ensuring meaningful political
oversight in the United States and encouraging other countries to join
in regulatory efforts would guarantee that the overall security
contribution remains positive.

After the end of the Cold War, U.S. missile defense, once a divisive
topic, gained bipartisan support. Although Iraqi and North Korean
missile capabilities spurred the development of new defensive systems,
the combination of incremental technological progress and Russia's
momentary loss of diplomatic clout created the necessary political
momentum. In 1997 in talks with the United States, Russia agreed under
pressure to the deployment of theater missile defenses on the condition
that they were not to be used against the other side. Russia expected to
preserve the core of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in return,
but the United States withdrew from that treaty in 2002 to complete
development of a new generation of systems aimed at intercepting
intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). The 1999 National Missile
Defense Act called for the United States to deploy "an effective
national missile defense system capable of defending the territory of
the United States against limited ballistic missile attack." At that
time, the stated level of ambition was modest, emphasizing technical
improvements to theater missile defenses over advancing territorial
systems.

Progress was achieved on the theater systems while technical success was
more elusive for new systems directed against key strategic threats,
such as the emerging long-range missile capabilities of Iran and North
Korea. Still, President George W. Bush's declared goal in 2002 to deploy
a homeland missile defense "within two years" did not reflect the actual
performance of available technology, such as the Ground-Based Midcourse
Defense (GMD) system. That system, which was fielded with untested
prototype kill vehicles that suffered malfunctions, is an illustration
of the dissonance between political and technological timelines. As of
2017, the GMD program has cost roughly \$40 billion, and the Department
of Defense assesses that the reliability and availability of the
ground-based interceptor missiles remain low.

[The [official narrative on missile defense]{.mark} programs [is
a]{.mark} subtle [mix between the call for staying ahead]{.mark} of the
threat by attempting to capitalize on continuous technological progress,
the permanent need to secure funding, [and an acknowledgment of the
limited effectiveness]{.mark} of fielded systems. [As a result]{.mark},
the U[.S. posture may seem to fluctuate]{.mark} greatly over short
periods of time, sometimes [sowing confusion among allies]{.mark}. In
Europe, for example, U.S. missile defense projects were first aimed at
protecting the United States against a future Iranian ICBM
threat.]{.underline} That shifted to the European Phased Adaptive
Approach, as the Obama administration's missile defense policy in Europe
is formally known, to defend NATO's European territory against a salvo
of Iranian shorter-range missiles. [Yet for several European countries,
the phased adaptive approach was primarily relevant as a symbol of U.S.
political assurances against Russia, an issue unrelated to the ballistic
threat it was meant to tackle]{.underline}.2 [Although the United States
clarified that Russia was not a target, the uncertainty surrounding the
final shape of the system fueled a debate about whether it posed a
potential threat to Russia's strategic capabilities, a situation that
Moscow used as a pretext to justify its own military buildup in
Europe]{.underline}.

Tech Breakthrough

[[Recent developments will add more uncertainty]{.mark} regarding U.S.
intentions.]{.underline} The 2017 National Defense Authorization Act,
although enhancing the "stabilizing benefits" of missile defense, calls
for the establishment of a "robust layered missile defense system"
capable of defending against the "increasingly complex" missile threat.
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) in February 2017 proposed the development of
new types of defenses while other lawmakers urged increasing the number
of GMD interceptors and initiating a space-based missile defense
program. [Analysts argue that the vocabulary used in the authorization
act is in line with previous documents, the absence of the term
"limited" paves the way for more ambitious objectives.]{.underline}

[The new ballistic missile defense review likely will echo this call for
more action. Further progress is necessary before ballistic missile
defense can be considered a strategic game-changer from the perspective
of the defender.]{.underline} Yet, predictions of such technological
breakthroughs are credible with certain caveats, suggesting the
potential for limited protection against Russian and Chinese missiles.

As the latest North Korean launches of the ICBM-range Hwasong-14 missile
demonstrate, the spread of offensive capabilities in third countries
will trigger a legitimate debate on the need for more advanced defenses.
Approximately 30 countries possess ballistic missiles, and more
countries in the Middle East and Asia will acquire them.

In the meantime, progress on specific systems, such as the Terminal High
Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, create the reassuring impression
among the public that missile defense may nullify the risk of an attack.
It provides a long-awaited political justification for the \$123 billion
invested by the Missile Defense Agency in the missile defense sector
since 2002 and even opens the perspective of a return on investment
through exports. In fact, as the perceived threat grows, the United
States holds a quasi-monopoly position on a potential \$23 billion
global market.3 These factors seem to call for a more ambitious missile
defense policy that would involve interception capabilities against
advanced systems and would seek to offset its costs through a more
aggressive export policy.

Such a policy, of course, comes at a price. [[The creation of a]{.mark}
global [missile defense network]{.mark} implies agreements with hosts
for forward-based sensors and interceptors, which [generates new
liabilities]{.mark} and commitments toward third states on the periphery
of the traditional U.S. areas of influence. It raises the issue of
defending new critical assets, especially radars, located on allied
territories, which are more vulnerable to preventive
destruction.]{.underline} For example, Russia threatened to destroy
fixed ballistic missile defense assets assigned to NATO in Poland,
Romania, and Turkey. In a crisis, it is not clear that all hosting
states would accept responsibility for systems they do not supervise,
such as in South Korea, or when the bilateral relationship is tense, as
with Turkey. Eventually, such a global network could reduce the U.S.
political margin of maneuverability in a conflict instead of improving
it.

[The economic factor also may drive missile defense programs in a
direction inconsistent with U.S. long-term strategic interests. First,
[the export-driven approach]{.mark}, which favors off-the-shelf
acquisitions, [has a mixed impact on the resilience of U.S.
allies]{.mark}]{.underline}. [For limited defense budgets, the
acquisition of costly missile defense systems may come at the expense of
more cost-efficient reforms in other sectors and put an end to the
development of indigenous capabilities]{.underline}, as has been the
case in Europe. [[It also will diffuse]{.mark} sensitive [technologies
among a much broader range]{.mark} of business partners while [prompting
adversaries]{.mark} of these countries [to invest even more in offensive
capabilities]{.mark} so as to overwhelm their defenses. As a result,
[the missile threat could grow rather than
diminish]{.mark}]{.underline}, but proponents argue that more effective
and numerous defensive systems could compensate for this.

Impact on Stability

[In the longer run, a policy to develop interception capabilities
against advanced systems could have an impact on strategic stability and
crisis stability.]{.underline} Concerns expressed by China and Russia
that U.S. missile defenses already undermine strategic stability are
far-fetched. Their views are mostly unrelated to current deployment but
nurtured by an insecure view of the future, including extreme
interpretation of projections that in 2030 the United States could
possess 350 to 550 missiles4 on Aegis ships with enhanced detection and
interception capacities.

In theory, missile defenses coupled with continued investment in
conventional long-range, precision-strike capabilities could help
disable significant portions of an adversary's arsenal during a first
strike while complicating retaliation, with the consequence of
increasing the risk of escalation to early use of nuclear weapons.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's 2008 statement that "it is most
likely that in the foreseeable future we will hear of hundreds and even
thousands of interceptor missiles in various parts of the world,
including Europe,"5 indicates that such concerns, although exaggerated,
are real. This is a reminder that, on the international stage, mutual
confidence matters as much as observable facts.

A U.S. breakthrough might ideally create an important rift between the
major rival powers and aspiring competitors. It could complicate the
efforts of potential adversaries to keep U.S. territory or forces under
the threat of a missile strike. Regional powers, such as Iran and North
Korea, would not give up their programs because they consider ballistic
missile capabilities a political guarantee against regime change.
However, they would be forced to devote far more of their limited
resources to countering missile defenses with decoys or increased
maneuverability while less advanced proliferators may abandon ballistic
missile ambitions to focus instead on cheaper, asymmetric strategies.
Such tactical achievements, even if limited and temporary, will be used
in the United States to dismiss any restraint on missile defenses as
counterproductive.

Yet, [[efforts]{.mark} to obtain a capability to reliably shoot down
advanced ballistic missiles [would almost certainly trigger a renewed
arms race]{.mark} with the greatest powers. [It would]{.mark} not only
[increase the risks of a misunderstanding]{.mark}, [but also justify a
surge in modernized nuclear stockpiles]{.mark} and delivery systems,
harming prospects for nuclear disarmament. [Potential adversaries would
use]{.mark} an ambitious U.S. [missile defense]{.mark} policy [as a
pretext to infringe on existing multilateral regimes]{.mark} if they
believe that such accords will eventually become obsolete anyway due to
technologically driven developments]{.underline}. For instance, this
could be used by Russia to justify formal withdrawal from the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and deployment of more
short-range ballistic missiles in Kaliningrad.

#### Arms sales increase instability---prolongs conflict, emboldens actors, and forces US to intervene 

Trevor **Thrall et al 18**, a senior fellow for the Cato's Institute's
Defense and Foreign Policy Department, 3/13/18, "Risky Business: The
Role of Arms Sales in U.S. Foreign Policy,"
https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#full

Entanglement[. [Arms sales]{.mark} raise the risk of entanglement in two
ways. First, they can [represent]{.mark} [early steps]{.mark} down the
slippery slope [to]{.mark} unwise [military intervention]{.mark}.
Consider a case like the Syrian civil war or the many cases during the
Cold War in which the United States wanted to support rebels and freedom
fighters against oppressive governments.]{.underline}74 [In the majority
of those cases, American leaders were wary of intervening directly.
Instead, the United States tended to rely on money, training, and arms
sales. But [by taking]{.mark} concrete [steps like arms sales to support
rebel groups]{.mark}, [Washington's]{.mark} psychological
[investmen]{.mark}t in the outcome [tends to rise]{.mark}]{.underline},
as do the political stakes for the president, who will be judged on
whether his efforts at support are successful or not. As we saw in the
Syrian civil war, for example, Barack Obama's early efforts to arm
Syrian rebels were roundly criticized as feckless, increasing pressure
on him to intervene more seriously.75

[History does not provide much guidance about how serious the risk of
this form of entanglement might be. During the Cold War, presidents from
Nixon onward viewed arms sales as a substitute for sending American
troops to do battle with communist forces around the world. The result
was an astonishing amount of weaponry transferred or sold to Third World
nations, many of which were engaged in active conflicts both external
and internal.]{.underline} The risk of superpower conflict made it
dangerous to intervene directly; accordingly, the Cold War-era risk of
entanglement from arms sales was low.76 [Today, however, [the United
States does not face nearly as many constraints on its behavior]{.mark},
as its track record of near-constant military intervention since the end
of the Cold War indicates. [As a result,]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the risk
of arms sales helping trigger future military intervention is
real]{.underline},]{.mark} even if it cannot be measured precisely.

[The second way in which [arms sales might entangle]{.mark} [the United
States]{.mark} is [by creating new disputes or exacerbating]{.mark}
existing [tensions.]{.mark} U.S. arms sales to Kurdish units fighting in
Syria against the Islamic State, for example, have ignited tensions
between the United States and its NATO ally Turkey, which sees the Kurds
as a serious threat to Turkish sovereignty and stability]{.underline}.77
Meanwhile, ongoing arms sales to NATO nations and to other allies like
South Korea and Taiwan have exacerbated tensions with Russia, China, and
North Korea, raising the risk of escalation and the possibility that the
United States might wind up involved in a direct conflict.78

Regional Effects. [Arms sales do not just affect the recipient nation;
they also affect the local balance of power, often causing ripple
effects throughout the region. Though advocates of arms sales trumpet
their stabilizing influence, as we have noted above, [arms sales often
lead to greater tension, less stability, and more conflict]{.mark}.
Because of this --- and the complementary problem of weapons dispersion
--- the regional impact of arms sales is less predictable and more
problematic than advocates acknowledge.]{.underline}

Instability, Violence, and Conflict. First, [arms sales can make
conflict more likely]{.underline}.79 [[This may occur because
recipients]{.mark} of new weapons [feel more confident about launching
attacks]{.mark} or because changes in the local balance of power can
fuel tensions and promote preventive strikes by others. [A study
of]{.mark} arms [sales from 1950 to]{.mark} 19[95,]{.mark}]{.underline}
for example, found that although arms sales appeared to have some
restraining effect on major-power allies, they had the opposite effect
in other cases, and [[concluded that "increased arms transfers]{.mark}
from major powers [make states significantly more likely to be]{.mark}
militarized [dispute initiators]{.mark}.]{.underline}"80 Another study
focused on sub-Saharan Africa from 1967 to 1997 found that "arms
transfers are significant and positive predictors of increased
probability of war."81 [Recent history provides supporting evidence for
these findings: since 2011, Saudi Arabia, the leading buyer of American
weapons, has intervened to varying degrees in Yemen, Tunisia, Syria, and
Qatar.]{.underline}

Second, [arms sales can also prolong and intensify ongoing conflicts and
erode rather than promote regional stability. [Few governments,
and]{.mark} fewer [insurgencies, have large]{.mark} enough [weapons
stocks to fight]{.mark} for long without resupply]{.underline}.82 [[The
tendency]{.mark} [of external powers to arm]{.mark} the side they
support, however understandable strategically, [has the]{.mark}
inevitable [result of allowing the conflict to continue at a higher
level of intensity]{.mark} than would otherwise be the
case]{.underline}. As one study of arms sales to Africa notes, "Weapons
imports are essential additives in this recipe for armed conflict and
carnage."83

[Third, this dynamic appears to be particularly troublesome with respect
to internal conflicts. Jennifer Erickson, for example, found that
recipients of major conventional weapons are 70 percent more likely to
engage in internal conflicts than other states. Though halting arms
sales alone is not a panacea for peace and stability, arms embargoes can
help lessen the destructiveness of combat in both civil and interstate
wars simply by restricting access to the means of
violence]{.underline}.84

[Finally, because of their effects on both interstate and internal
conflict, [arms sales]{.mark} can also [erode]{.mark} rather than
promote [regional stability]{.mark}]{.underline}. As noted in the
previous section, where the United States seeks to manage regional
balances of power[, arms sales often create tension, whether [because
the American role]{.mark} in the region [threatens others or
because]{.mark} American [clients feel emboldened]{.mark}. The Middle
East, for example, has seesawed between violence and tense standoffs for
the past many decades, at first because of Cold War competition and more
recently because of the American war on terror. The notion that
increased U.S. arms sales since 9/11 made the Middle East more stable is
far-fetched to say the least.]{.underline} Similarly, though many argue
that American security commitments to countries like Japan, Taiwan, and
South Korea have produced greater stability, there is a strong case to
be made that the opposite is now true. American support of South Korea
has driven North Korea to develop nuclear weapons; the presence of U.S.
missile defense systems in South Korea has aggravated China, and
American support of Taiwan produces continual tension between the two
powers.85

#### Arms sales have empirically emboldened actors and failed to stop conflict 

Perry **Cammack et al 18**, a nonresident fellow in the Middle East
Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 2018,
"Fueling Middle East Conflicts or Dousing the Flames,"
https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/10/23/fueling-middle-east-conflicts-or-dousing-flames-pub-77548

[Beyond direct military involvement, outside actors also intervene
indirectly through arms sales and security assistance, which can seem an
appealing way to influence the contours of a conflict without deploying
troops or undertaking military action.]{.underline} Moreover, for
leading exporters, including the United States and its European allies
as well as Russia and China, arms sales can generate significant
economic benefits, and they have become a diplomatic priority as well as
a factor in the political fortune of leaders in exporting countries.

The Middle East is the most militarized region in the world. Although
numbering less than 6 percent of the world's population and contributing
less than 5 percent of its GDP, it accounted for nearly one-third of the
world's arms imports between 2013 and 2017---more than doubling its
share compared to the previous five-year period.11

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates were three of the four
top arms importers in the world (with Algeria and Iraq also in the top
ten) between 2013 and 2017. All three have intervened militarily in
neighboring countries (Saudi Arabia and the UAE in Yemen, Egypt in
Libya) since 2013. Turkey and Israel (also a significant exporter) were
in the world's top twenty arms importers, while Iran imported much fewer
arms (primarily from Russia and China) due to international sanctions.12

Meanwhile, the United States was the world's largest arms exporter
between 2013 and 2017, comprising some 34 percent of the global total,
followed by Russia, France, Germany, China, and the United Kingdom. The
United States and the UK were the major suppliers to Saudi Arabia, while
the United States and France have supplied Egypt as well as the UAE.
Germany has diminished its sales to Arab states, although it remains a
major supplier to Israel.13

The April 2018 U.S. presidential memorandum to streamline procedures for
conventional arms transfers issued by Donald Trump is unabashed
regarding the economic advantages of arms exports; its first paragraph
hails "a dynamic defense industrial base, which currently employs more
than 1.7 million people."14 French President Emmanuel Macron also has
pushed aggressively for arms sales to the Middle East, despite growing
criticism of potential abuses related to the technology provided.15

In addition to the economic benefits, advocates of arms exports in
democratic countries argue that arms sales and security assistance
programs can help to professionalize developing militaries, and in this
way can produce a moderating influence on recipient nations.16 U.S.
officials also tout the need to improve allied states' capabilities to
enhance the possibility of joint operations with U.S. forces.

[But is there evidence that the increased provision of arms has helped
to stabilize the Middle East, or even to provide victory for key allies?
Unfortunately, [the brutality of]{.mark} contemporary [Middle Eastern
wars]{.mark} [suggests that]{.mark} this [flood of weapons has]{.mark}
poured fuel on the fire and [made conflicts lengthier as well as
deadlier]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[First, [arms sales to belligerents]{.mark} in a conflict are seldom a
decisive factor, but rather [invite a counterreaction by opposing
states]{.mark}, thereby feeding civil wars rather than extinguishing
them. [U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline} and European [[supply]{.mark} to the
Saudi-Emirati intervention in Yemen [has coincided with Iran's]{.mark}
increased [support for]{.mark} its [Houthi]{.mark}
partners]{.underline}.17 [The provision of weapons by the United States
and several Gulf states to Syrian rebels initially helped to tip the
balance against the Syrian army. But this same support also encouraged
Iran to escalate its support, and once it became clear that the Obama
administration would not take direct military action against the Syrian
armed forces, Russia seized an opening to intervene and defeat those
same rebels, thereby decisively changing the contours of the
conflict.]{.underline}

[Even worse, [arms provided to militaries in fragile or highly corrupt
states can slip into the hands of terrorists, militias, and other
nonstate actors]{.mark}.]{.underline} Although the Houthi rebels have
reportedly received Iranian-supplied ballistic missiles, many of their
ballistic missile stocks are composed of Russian and North Korean
weapons originally provided to the Yemeni army and seized during Houthi
advances in 2013 and 2014.18 A comprehensive survey by Conflict Armament
Research of 40,000 combat items recovered from Islamic State fighters in
Syria and Iraq suggests that more than 50 percent of their weapons were
originally produced by Russia and China (many of them for the Syrian and
Iraqi armies), and 30 percent originated from Warsaw Pact--era Eastern
Europe. Three percent of weapons and 13 percent of ammunition were NATO
caliber, presumably seized from the Iraqi armed forces during the
Islamic State's advances in 2014.19

[In one case, an advanced anti-tank guided weapon was reportedly
manufactured in Europe, sold to the United States, supplied to a party
in Syria, and transferred to the Islamic State in Iraq, where it was
recovered---all within two months of leaving the factory]{.underline}.20
[Unfortunately, the advanced weapons systems being sold to authoritarian
Arab governments today may be used by insurgent fighters in future
wars.]{.underline}

[What of the argument that security assistance and arms sales can
moderate the behavior of recipient countries? Here too, experience
suggests otherwise. Take the examples of U.S. security assistance to
Egypt and U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates.]{.underline}

[The United States has provided \$1.3 billion in security assistance to
Egypt annually since the 1978 Camp David Accords, totaling more than
\$46 billion.22 While the hope had been that the assistance would help
modernize, professionalize, and depoliticize Egypt's military, in fact
the opposite has happened. In 2013, then defense minister (now
President) Abdel Fattah el-Sisi upended a brief democratic opening, and
since then the military domination of politics and the economy has
escalated sharply]{.underline}. Gross human rights abuses have also
risen, fueling an insurgency in Sinai and radicalization among youth in
prisons. [The United States has struggled to use its assistance as
leverage; the Obama and Trump administrations each suspended portions of
assistance or equipment deliveries due to alarming rights violations and
lack of cooperation in other forms, but then gave up and resumed aid
without getting anything in return. Any potential political leverage was
thus forfeited.]{.underline}

[A review of 2017 U.S. arms sales found at least \$659 million in sales
to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for laser-guided bombs and
other munitions, as well as firearms, to be used in combat operations in
Yemen.23 But [there is little evidence that the U.S. support for the
Saudi]{.mark}-Emirati [campaign has either accelerated a coalition
victory]{.mark} (thereby shortening the conflict) [or]{.mark}
significantly [reduced casualties in Yemen]{.mark}. U.S.-made weapons
systems have targeted school buses, funerals, and hospitals.24 Four
years into the war, the situation has been called the worst humanitarian
crisis in the world, with millions of Yemenis at risk of starvation or
suffering from related diseases.]{.underline} Germany and Spain have cut
off weapons sales to the intervening parties, and pressure has grown in
the United Kingdom and United States to consider doing likewise,
particularly after an August 2018 United Nations report found that
practices by both sides in the conflict amounted to war crimes.25

### 2AC\-- Tech Fails 

#### Houthis using drones and sophisticated technology to get around Saudi BMD

Jared **Malsin 19**, Middle East Correspondent for the Wall Street
Journal, 6/25/19, "Iran-Allied Houthis Expose Holes in Saudi Arabia's
Missile Defense,"
https://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-allied-houthis-expose-holes-in-saudi-arabias-missile-defense-11561455002

CAIRO---[Yemen's [Houthi rebels have accelerated missile and drone
attacks]{.mark} on Saudi Arabia in recent weeks, [highlighting the
kingdom's military vulnerabilities]{.mark} in defending
itself]{.underline} against an Iranian ally amid a crisis in U.S.-Iran
relations.

The Houthis have executed 10 missile or drone attacks since April on
Saudi airports, a desalination plant, a major oil pipeline and other
targets, escalating fighting on a key front in the regionwide
confrontation between U.S. and Iran. The Houthi attacks have occurred
around the same time as the tanker attacks in the Gulf of Oman that the
U.S. has blamed on Iran.

U.S. officials and analysts say Iran has deepened its cooperation with
the Houthis as the country seeks ways to harass its American and Saudi
adversaries. Iran denies controlling the Houthis and says it wasn't
responsible for the tanker attacks in the Gulf of Oman.

Escalating Violence

[The Houthi attacks have put a spotlight on the missile defenses of
Saudi Arabia. The country's military is one of the best equipped
globally thanks to the world's third-largest military budget, with
hundreds of billions of dollars spent on fighter planes, tanks and other
military hardware. But [the kingdom's]{.mark} American-made [Patriot
missile-defense system has a mixed record]{.mark} when it comes to
intercepting projectiles from Yemen [and isn't primarily designed for
repelling drones.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"[The recent events show that we are exposed in terms of our
defense]{.underline}," said one Saudi official who wasn't authorized to
speak publicly.

A spokesman for the Saudi military coalition against the Houthis didn't
respond to a request for comment on the strikes.

[The Saudi government has claimed their defenses have been successful in
the past, such as in March 2018 when the kingdom said its Patriots
successfully intercepted seven Scud missiles fired by the Houthis.
Videos published on social media, however, showed Saudi Patriot systems
misfiring during the incident, including one that made a U-turn and
plunged to the ground.]{.underline}

[The Houthis' ability to seemingly strike at will in Saudi Arabia
highlights the risks that the Saudis, a key U.S. ally, have become
bogged down in a costly, four-year-old conflict that it can't win
outright.]{.underline} The Houthis have demonstrated increasing
sophistication and range with projectile attacks, launching more armed
drones and cruise missiles despite a Saudi blockade on Yemen to stop
such arms from getting into the country.

The Houthis' most recent attack, a drone strike Sunday on the airport in
the city of Abha near the Yemeni border, killed one person and injured
21 others, according to the Saudi military. Two other strikes in the
past two weeks used cruise missiles, marking the first time the Houthis
have fired such weapons since 2017.

The tactics indicate the rebels' willingness to target major civilian
infrastructure. "Our ballistic and winged missiles and aircraft of all
kinds can hit any target throughout the geography of Saudi Arabia," a
Houthi military spokesman said June 20 on one of the group's official
Twitter accounts.

Saudi officials have directly blamed Tehran for some of the attacks.
Saudi and U.S. officials have accused Iran of providing the Houthis with
the training and designs to build their drones, while drones recovered
in Yemen by United Arab Emirates forces show imported Iranian
technology, according to Conflict Armament Research, a weapons expert
group that works with governments around the world.

"Everything points toward the direction that Iran and the Houthis have
teamed up for their mutual benefit to increase missile and drone attacks
against targets in recent days and weeks," said Fabian Hinz, an
independent analyst based in Germany who is monitoring the recent Yemeni
strikes.

Saudi Arabia, citing the Houthi and tanker attacks, has called for
unspecified but decisive action against Iran while stopping short of
calling for a full-blown war.

[Though Saudi Arabia's military is well-equipped, a war with Iran would
be devastating and possibly unwinnable. Iran boasts a large conventional
military, and its powerful Revolutionary Guard Corps specializes in
asymmetrical warfare and can pull on its ties with militant groups
across the Middle East.]{.underline}

The Saudis have put to the test their ability to use Western arms in
their war against the Houthis, leading a bombing campaign to support
ground troops provided by other countries such as Sudan, the United Arab
Emirates and Yemen's internationally recognized government. The war, a
symbol of the kingdom's aggressive new foreign policy led by the young
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has left more than 10,000 people dead
and created a humanitarian crisis.

[[The campaign has failed to defeat the]{.mark} Iranian-allied [rebels
and left the kingdom vulnerable to]{.mark} Houthi [retaliatory
strikes]{.mark}. [Missile defense in general is technologically
challenging]{.mark}---even Israel's Iron Dome fails to stop some of the
rockets launched by Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip---[and the
Houthis have used a mix]{.mark} of drones and cruise missiles [to find
weaknesses]{.mark} in the Saudis' defenses.]{.underline}

### 1AR\-\-- Tech Fails 

#### THAAD Tech fails---worsened deficiencies in reliability and training 

Sebastien **Roblin 18**, Security and military history analyst for War
Is Boring, 2/11/18, "America\'s Missile Defense Systems: The Ultimate
Paper Tiger?,"
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/americas-missile-defense-systems-the-ultimate-paper-tiger-24436

[While the [MDA has yet to release details as to what caused latest
failure]{.mark}, annual [reports r]{.mark}eleased in January (prior to
the latest test) by the Pentagon's Department of Testing & Evaluation
[reveal that]{.mark} it has "decreased confidence" in the reliability of
the Block IIA missiles, while even the more favorably tested
[THAAD]{.mark} system [is showing "worsened deficiencies" in operator
training and system reliability.]{.mark}]{.underline}

A Mixed Report Card for Ballistic-Missile Defense

Not all of the news in the DOT&E reports is negative. Notably, the
testing department states that the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system
"has demonstrated the capability" to defend the entire continental
United States from longer-range and harder-to-hit Intercontinental
Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs)---at least from a limited attack using less
sophisticated types of such weapons. Though the GMD has a slightly
spottier testing record than the SM-3 series, a successful test
interception of an ICBM target in July 2017 has increased confidence
that it would actually work.

Note, however, that GMD has yet to be tested against a "complex"
ballistic target that deploys decoys and/or multiple warheads to confuse
and overwhelm defensive missiles. Most experts believe that any country
capable of developing an ICBM in the first place will also have the
capacity to eventually develop the technology for complex missiles.

Fortunately, both THAAD and the Aegis system were tested against complex
medium- and intermediate-range missiles in 2017, and targeting radars
successfully discriminated between real reentry vehicles and decoys.

However, two of the four successful tests performed by the Aegis
involved terminal-phase interceptions of ballistic missiles by SM-6 Dual
missiles, which have much shorter range and are currently only deployed
onboard ships at sea. While they will provide vital terminal-phase
defense for naval forces and are effective in antiaircraft and even
ground-attack roles, they have limited applicability to regional defense
against ballistic missiles.

The other two successful tests included interceptions by a Block IIA on
February 2017 (which you can see in this video) and a "Threat Update"
version of an earlier Block IB--model missile in October.

It is on the Block IIA that both the United States and Japan are placing
their bets for regional missile defense of the Pacific. Indeed, Tokyo
recently purchased four more of the missiles at a cost of \$33 million
each, and plans on installing two Aegis Ashore batteries on Japanese
soil by 2023 at a cost of well over \$2 billion dollars. Already, four
Japanese destroyers deploy the SM-3 missile, with four more on the way.
Eight U.S. Navy destroyers are also outfitted for long-range
ballistic-missile defense---though two of the destroyers are currently
out of commission, due to collisions with commercial shipping which
occurred in the summer of 2017.

The Pentagon's testing agency "has lower confidence in SM-3 missile
reliability due to recent in-flight failures, coupled with MDA
shortfalls in simulating the in-flight environment in its SM-3 ground
test program, addressing failures and anomalies identified during flight
testing, and implementing a rigorous configuration management and
control process for SM-3 production."

The report details software flaws that could cause failed interception,
as well as dissatisfaction with the testing of the system's resilience
to electromagnetic interference. However, as the recent false alarm in
Hawaii vividly demonstrated, humans can be even more prone to mistakes
than advanced technology. The second to last SM-3 test failed when a
sailor accidentally identified the ballistic target as a "friendly,"
causing the interceptor to self-destruct. The evaluating report dryly
notes this reflects a "deficiency that allows an operator to break a
ballistic missile engagement with a push of a button, without having to
confirm action."

There is some good news for Aegis Ashore: recent exercises have
successfully demonstrated the system's capability of networking with
friendly sensor platforms, including those of NATO allies. Furthermore,
the SM-6 and older SM-2 Block IV missiles are deemed to have proven
"reliable" as terminal missile-defense systems.

THAAD Personnel Need Better Training and a More Reliable Generator

The Army's THAAD system is designed to protect a smaller hundred-mile
radius from attack by ramming short- to intermediate-range missiles as
they begin plunging down towards their target in their terminal phase.
Currently, the system has been deployed to South Korea, Guam and Hawaii.
THAAD has a more consistent success record in tests, and in 2017
continued that streak with two more successful intercepts in 2017,
including one against an MRBM that deployed decoys.

However, [the evaluation department is again concerned about the human
element, judging that "THAAD training and documentation deficiencies
worsened in FY17." It specifies that [current THAAD courses "provide
insufficient time to effectively train operators]{.mark} for their
missions, [and]{.mark} the [operators often encounter software
mismatches]{.mark} between institutional training and operational
environments." Part of the problem is reportedly that [upgrades
to]{.mark} the THAAD [hardware]{.mark}, software and operational
procedures [are not being reflected with updates to]{.mark} the
documentation and [training]{.mark} simulators.]{.underline}

[[THAAD systems also continue to suffer power failures]{.mark} in their
three-kilowatt generators, [and breakdowns in]{.mark} their radar's
[cooling systems.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[More generally, the Pentagon testers are worried that [the entire
Ballistic Missile Defense System]{.mark}, including its numerous radars,
[is deficient in cybersecurity]{.mark} and recommends much more
comprehensive testing of the system's vulnerability to cyber and
electronic-warfare attacks.]{.underline}

[Overall, the United States' ballistic-missile [defenses remain a work
in progress]{.mark}]{.underline}. The testing reports describe promising
results from live-fire tests of more sophisticated ballistic-missile
targets employing decoys. However, a key component of the system---the
SM-3 Block IIA missile---has had a rough year, even as it stands to
become the linchpin of Japan's home island defenses.

#### Recent failures of THAAD missiles in Saudi Arabia prove the tech doesn't work

David **Axe 18**, Contributor to VICE News, 3/27/18, "US-Made Missile
Defenses Spectacularly Failed in Saudi Arabia,"
https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8xkgw4/patriot-missile-saudi-arabia-yemen

[[At least five]{.mark} American-[made Patriot missiles]{.mark}
apparently [missed, malfunctioned, or]{.mark} otherwise [failed when
Saudi forces tried to intercept a barrage of rockets]{.mark} targeting
Riyadh]{.underline} on March 25.

That\'s bad news for the US military and its closest allies, who are
counting on the Patriot to stop large-scale enemy attacks during a major
war.

[The ground-launched, radar-guided Patriot missile, which is 19 feet
long in its basic version, has been controversial since shortly after
its introduction in 1984. It missed many of its targets during the 1991
Gulf War. Twelve years later during the US-led invasion of Iraq, Patriot
crews shot down two allied warplanes, killing three crew
members.]{.underline}

\"[It\'s nothing but an unbroken trail of disasters with this weapon
system]{.underline},\" Theodore Postol, an MIT physicist and prominent
critic of US missile defenses, told me.

Rebel forces from the Houthi group, which has taken over much of Yemen
in recent years, fired at least seven rockets at Saudi Arabia on the
night of March 25. Saudi Arabia leads a coalition of Middle East
countries battling the Houthis in Yemen.

The Saudi military launched Patriot Advanced Capability-2 missiles in an
attempt to destroy the Houthi rockets in mid-air. The Saudis claimed
seven of the Patriots struck their targets.

One man reportedly died after being struck by metal fragments. It\'s
unclear whether the fragments came from a malfunctioning Patriot, a
successful intercept or a Houthi rockets striking the ground.

[Amateur videos that appeared online in the aftermath of the missile
skirmish indicate that [many of the Patriots]{.mark}---which are
manufactured by US firm Raytheon---[exploded in mid-air or veered off
course.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The same thing happened during the 1991 Gulf War, said Postol, a former
Pentagon science advisor. \"It seems in 25 years they haven\'t fixed
it.\"

[The Patriot flies a straight trajectory for the first four seconds
after launch, during which time the missile accelerates past the sound
barrier. The missile has a habit of malfunctioning during those initial
seconds in the air. Of the apparent five separate [Patriot
launches]{.mark} that appear in videos from Riydah, two seem to have
[ended in premature explosions]{.mark} during the acceleration
phase]{.underline}, Postol pointed out.

[After four seconds in the air, a Patriot begins maneuvering and
searching for a signal from the ground-based radar that helps to guide
it. Three of the Saudi Patriots appear to have malfunctioned during this
phase of flight. \"They suddenly went downward and
exploded,]{.underline}\" Postol said.

[[The failures over Saudi Arabia]{.mark} last weekend could [point to a
design flaw that critics]{.mark}]{.underline} such as Postol [[have been
trying for decades to fix]{.mark}. \"In the Gulf War of 1991, we
definitely saw Patriots take off, turn around and dive to ground in both
Saudi Arabia and in Israel,\"]{.underline} Postol told me.

\"When we reported what we saw in videos from Israel, Raytheon claimed
this only occured in Israel because the Israelis didn\'t know what they
were doing. Then we uncovered videos of the missiles doing the same
thing in Saudi Arabia.\"

Raytheon did not respond to a request for comment. In 2018, the US
Defense Department set aside \$1.1 billion to buy 240 Patriot missiles.

[Patriots continued to malfunction in 2003. US Army Patriot crews
mistakenly shot down a US Navy F/A-18 fighter and a British Royal Air
Force Tornado bomber, killing the American pilot and both British crew
members. Coalition aircrews grew to fear their own
air-defenses.]{.underline}

"The Patriots scared the Hell out of us," one F-16 pilot remarked.
Another F-16 pilot actually fired a missile at a US Patriot system after
the Patriot crew locked onto the F-16 with its radar.

Postol blamed the 2003 incidents on a combination of poor training and
technical flaws in the Patriot. Like many air-defense systems, the
Patriot searches for radio-transponder signals in an effort to separate
allied warplanes from enemy ones. Following the 2003 shoot-downs, the
U.S.-led coalition ordered its aircrews to switch to more reliable
transponders that the Patriots hopefully would be better able to detect.

As recently as 2010, the US Missile Defense Agency claimed it had
improved the Patriot. \"Over the past decade the United States has made
significant progress in developing and fielding essential capabilities
for protection against attack from short- and medium-range ballistic
missiles,\" the agency reported. \"These capabilities include
increasingly capable Patriot batteries.\"

The Missile Defense Agency did not respond to a request for comment.

[[Multiple failures on the part of Saudi Arabia\'s Patriots could
indicate that]{.mark}, in fact, [the]{.mark} air-defense [system hasn\'t

#### Be skeptical of their ev---Saudi has been misleading about the success of THAAD 

Max **Fisher et al 17**, Max Fisher writes The Interpreter, a news
column and newsletter that explore the ideas and context behind major
world events, 12/4/17, "Did American Missile Defense Fail in Saudi
Arabia,"
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/04/world/middleeast/saudi-missile-defense.html

[[The official story was]{.mark} clear: [Saudi forces shot down a
ballistic missile]{.mark} fired by Yemen's Houthi rebel group last month
at Saudi Arabia's capital, Riyadh. [It was a victory for]{.mark} the
Saudis and for the United States, which supplied [the Patriot]{.mark}
missile defense [system.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"Our system knocked the missile out of the air," President Trump said
the next day from Air Force One en route to Japan, one of the 14
countries that use the system. "That's how good we are. Nobody makes
what we make, and now we're selling it all over the world."

[[But an analysis]{.mark} of photos and videos of the strike posted to
social media [suggests that story may be wrong.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Instead[, evidence analyzed by a research team of missile
experts]{.mark} appears to [show the missile's warhead flew unimpeded
over Saudi defenses and nearly hit]{.mark} its target, [Riyadh's
airport]{.mark}. The warhead detonated so close to the domestic terminal
that customers jumped out of their seats.]{.underline}

[Saudi officials did not respond to a request for comment. Some [U.S.
officials cast doubt on whether the Saudis hit any part of the incoming
missile]{.mark}, saying there was no evidence that it had.
[Instead,]{.mark} they said, the [incoming missile]{.mark} body and
warhead [may have come apart]{.mark} because of its sheer speed and
force.]{.underline}

[[The findings]{.underline}]{.mark} show that the Iranian-backed
Houthis, once a ragtag group of rebels, have grown powerful enough to
strike major targets in Saudi Arabia, possibly shifting the balance of
their years-long war. And they [[underscore]{.mark} longstanding [doubts
about missile]{.mark} defense [tech]{.mark}nology, a centerpiece of
American and allied national defense strategies, particularly against
Iran and North Korea.]{.underline}

#### BMD inevitably fails\-\-- tech problems ruin any deterrence utility 

Laura **Grego 18**, A Senior Scientist in the Global Security Program,
Union of Concerned Scientists, 04/24/18, "The Faulty and Dangerous Logic
of Missile Defense,"
https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-faulty-and-dangerous-logic-of-missile-defense/

[North Korea's recent and dramatic tests of long-range missiles have
created a sense of urgency and vulnerability in the United States,
leading to renewed calls for expanding missile defenses]{.underline}.
The administration and Congress have approved huge funding increases for
existing systems, and call for developing new types of
defenses---potentially including interceptors in space.

[Is this the answer? How should one think about missile defense: as a
protective shield or a dangerous illusion?]{.underline}

Missile defenses have as long a history as missiles do, and in the late
1960s American and Soviet scientists came to believe that a defense
against long-range missiles would never be effective because the other
country would simply build more weapons to defeat it, leading to a
dangerous arms race. The 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, which
placed strict limits on U.S. and Soviet/Russian strategic missile
defenses, reflected that understanding.

President Reagan's 1983 "Star Wars" speech challenged that idea by
calling for the United States to develop a large defensive system that
included orbiting interceptors. Recognized by most experts as
unworkable, this expansive system was pared down over the next decade
and finally shelved, although work continued on interceptor technology
during the Clinton administration.

Then, in 2002, President George W. Bush abandoned the logic of the ABM
Treaty, by withdrawing from it and announcing that the United States
would field the first interceptors of a new Ground-based Midcourse
Defense (GMD) in less than two years. To do so, the administration
exempted its development from the strict "fly-before-you-buy" rules that
govern all other large Pentagon projects---a step that has had dire and
long-lasting consequences.

GMD remains the sole system designed to counter intercontinental
ballistic missiles. Its 44 silo-based interceptors in Alaska and
California are designed to be guided by space, ground and sea-based
sensors to collide with an incoming warhead and destroy it with the
force of impact.

[Reflecting the difficulty of the task, and the haste and lack of rigor
of its development, [the]{.mark} GMD [system]{.mark} today [has a very
poor test record]{.mark}, even though these tests were "scripted for
success]{.underline}" according to former Pentagon head testing official
Phil Coyle.

[The problems are well documented. Only about half of the 18 intercept
tests since 1999 successfully destroyed their targets, and the test
record has not improved with time: only two of the last five tests were
successful---and GMD has still has not been tested under operationally
realistic conditions. Thus, [there is no evidence]{.mark} that the \$40
billion [GMD]{.mark} system [provides a reliable defense, even
against]{.mark} a country like [North Korea.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[More fundamentally, even if the reliability is improved, GMD's
prospects for providing an effective defense in the future are poor
because [it will face countermeasures that any country that]{.mark} has
[developed a]{.mark} long-range missile and a [nuclear warhead could
readily use to confuse]{.mark} or overwhelm [the
system.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Despite these problems, however, the administration and Congress plan
to expand the system]{.underline}; the current budget includes funding
to build 20 additional interceptors.

#### BMD tech fails- ruins deterrence credibility 

Alex **Lockie 18**, a news editor and a military and foreign-policy
blogger at Business Insider, 2/2/18, "US ballistic missile defense just
doesn\'t work --- but we keep spending billions and billions on it,"
[[https://www.businessinsider.com/us-ballistic-missile-defense-doesnt-work-but-we-spend-billions-on-it-2018-2]{.underline}](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-ballistic-missile-defense-doesnt-work-but-we-spend-billions-on-it-2018-2)

[The US public learned on Wednesday that the [US Navy tried and failed
for the second time]{.mark} in a year [to intercept a missile]{.mark}
with an SM-III missile from the defense contractor
Raytheon.]{.underline}

[[On the same day, the Pentagon announced it would spend another \$6.5
billion on]{.mark} 20 more missile interceptors for the ground-based
midcourse defense system ([GMD)]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is meant to
protect the US homeland from missile attacks from North Korea or Russia.

[[But the GMD has a bad track record]{.mark}. It recently had a
successful test that may have calmed the fears of some in the US amid
nuclear tensions with North Korea, but a recent paper on the test shows
it was unrealistically generous.]{.underline}

[Laura Grego and David Wright, leading experts in the field of ballistic
missiles, writing for the Union of Concerned Scientists, found that the
so-called intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) the GMD knocked down
was flown on a favorable trajectory, slower than the real thing, and
without any of the tricks or savvy North Korea might use in an actual
attack. The paper concludes [the US has no reliable ballistic missile
defense capability]{.mark} for the homeland.]{.underline}

[That capability, or lack thereof, comes after the US has spent more
than \$40 billion over the last decade in a half on ballistic missile
defense.]{.underline}

During that time, Boeing, Raytehon, and Lockheed Martin, key players in
the BMD scene, have all posted record profits --- and they continue to
get contracts with the Pentagon.

To be clear, the US can defend against some, shorter-range missiles.
Aegis-equipped ballistic missile destroyers at sea have a good track
record of defending themselves, but they\'re not meant to go after
ICBMs. [[Patriot missiles]{.mark} [have]{.mark} saved some lives from
short-range missile attacks on the battlefield, though that has [been
historically over-hyped]{.mark} or just lied about.]{.underline}

BMD kind of works on a theoretical level, but is that worth \$40B?

Missile defense plays into the complicated and highly theoretical world
of nuclear deterrence. For an adversary like North Korea, maybe even the
single-digit percent chance a missile would be intercepted by the US
would dissuade them from attacking.

But much more likely, North Korea wouldn\'t attack the US because of the
US\'s ability to return the favor tenfold.

[It\'s entirely unclear, and [no expert can demonstrate beyond
reasonable doubt that BMD has ever deterred anyone]{.mark}, or done
anything beside line pockets of defense contractors.]{.underline}

[For the US taxpayer, who has contributed billions to the cause of
missile defenses while enriching the world\'s biggest defense
contractors, a fair question might be: Where is the capability? Why
don\'t these systems work?]{.underline}

### 2AC- Blowback Turn 

#### Arms sales worse for US security- blowback

Trevor **Thrall et al 18**, a senior fellow for the Cato's Institute's
Defense and Foreign Policy Department, 3/13/18, "Risky Business: The
Role of Arms Sales in U.S. Foreign Policy,"
https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#full

Blowback. [The fact that the United States has sold weapons to almost
every nation on earth, combined with frequent military intervention,
means that blowback is an inescapable outcome of U.S. arms sales policy.
[American troops and]{.mark} their [allies have faced
American]{.mark}-made [weapons in almost every military
engagement]{.mark} since the end of the Cold War, including in Panama,
Haiti, Somalia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, and Syria. And even where the
United States has not yet engaged in combat, [American arms sales have
bolstered the military capabilities of adversaries once counted as
friendly.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Blowback can occur in at least three ways[. First, a previously friendly
regime becomes unfriendly. [For example, the United States sold]{.mark}
billions of dollars in [weapons to]{.mark} the Shah of [Iran during the
1970s]{.mark} in the hopes that Iran would provide a stabilizing
influence on the Middle East.]{.underline} The sales included everything
from fighter jets for air campaigns to surface-to-air missiles to shoot
down enemy fighters.70 [After the 1979 revolution, however, Iran used
those weapons in its war with Iraq and enabled the new Iranian regime to
exert its influence in the region.]{.underline} Panama, the recipient of
decades of American military assistance, as well as host to a major
military base and 9,000 U.S. troops, was a similar case. In 1989, Gen.
Manuel Noriega --- himself a CIA asset for more than 20 years --- took
power and threatened U.S. citizens, prompting a U.S. invasion that
featured American troops facing American weapons.71

[[Blowback also occurs when the United States sells weapons to
nations]{.mark} (or transfers them to nonstate actors) [that]{.mark},
though not allies, simply [did not register as potential]{.mark}
[adversaries]{.mark} at the time of the sale. The United States, for
example, sold surface-to-air missiles, towed guns, tanks, and armored
personnel carriers to Somalia during the 1980s. Few officials would have
imagined that the United States would find itself intervening in Somalia
in 1992, or that the United States and its allies would provide billions
in weapons and dual-use equipment to Iraq in an effort to balance
against Iran, only to wind up confronting Iraq on the battlefield to
reverse its annexation of Kuwait.]{.underline}72

[[And]{.mark} finally, [blowback can occur when U.S. weapons are sold or
stolen]{.mark} from the government that bought them and wind up on the
battlefield in the hands of the adversary. For example, the Reagan
administration covertly provided Stinger missiles to the Mujahideen, who
were fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan during the 1980s; they in turn
sold them off eventually to Iran and North Korea, among
others.]{.underline} More recently, the Islamic State managed to capture
from the Iraqi government a stunning number of Humvees and tanks the
United States had sold to Iraq to rebuild its military capabilities
after the 2003 invasion, as well as enough small arms and ammunition to
supply three divisions of a conventional army.73

[These examples of [blowback demonstrate how difficult it can be to
forecast the long-term outcomes of arms sales a]{.mark}nd how obvious it
is that selling weapons carries a number of risks. Predicting what
exactly will happen is hard, [but predicting]{.mark} that arms sales to
[clients with red flags]{.mark} are likely to end badly [is]{.mark}
quite [easy.]{.mark} Iraq was a fragile state ravaged by a decade's
worth of American intervention and rife with terrorism and civil
conflict; to transfer such large quantities of weapons to its military
and police force under such conditions was to invite
disaster.]{.underline}

### 2AC- US Weapons Key

#### US weapons are the backbone of the Saudi military

William **Hartung 19**, the director of the Arms and Security Project at
the Center for International Policy, 5/16/19, "It's Time to Stop Arms
Sales to Saudi Arabia,"
https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/05/16/its-time-stop-arms-sales-saudi-arabia

[For starters, Congress should work to close off the other main avenue
of U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition---the sale of bombs, combat
aircraft, armored vehicles, attack helicopters, and other equipment to
Saudi Arabia and the UAE, the two primary perpetrators of the
humanitarian crisis in Yemen.]{.underline} According to statistics from
the Security Assistance Monitor, the United States has offered over \$68
billion in weaponry to those two nations since the start of the current
Yemen conflict in March 2015. As Bruce Riedel of the Brookings
Institution has noted, [these [U.S.-supplied systems are the backbone of
the Saudi military, and without those weapons]{.mark} and related
maintenance and support [they could not sustain their intervention in
Yemen]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Trump administration, the U.S. arms
industry, and the Saudi and UAE lobbies have made numerous arguments in
favor of keeping U.S. weapons flowing to its Gulf allies, but none of
them holds up to scrutiny. [With respect to the sales of
precision-guided bombs---whose use has been documented in the widespread
killings of civilians---[the argument of choice has been that even more
civilians would die]{.mark} in Saudi/UAE air strikes [if the coalition
were limited to "dumb" bombs]{.mark} that could not be targeted as
accurately. This assertion is premised on the idea that Saudi
[Arabia]{.mark} and the UAE are making good faith efforts to avoid
hitting civilians]{.underline}. [The sheer volume of strikes on targets
like hospitals, a school bus, funerals, factories, water treatment
plants, and other civilian infrastructure puts the lie to this argument.
[Air strikes on civilians are not "mistakes." They are part]{.mark} and
parcel [of the]{.mark} Saudi/UAE [strategy to bomb Yemenis into
submission]{.mark} and end the war on terms favorable to their
coalition. Another popular argument for continuing arms sales to Saudi
Arabia and the UAE is "if we don't do it, somebody else will." But [the
United States]{.mark} and its European allies [supply]{.mark} the Saudi
air force and [the majority of the arsenals of both Saudi Arabia and the
UAE.]{.mark} The Saudi and UAE militaries could not turn on a dime and
seek Russian or Chinese systems to substitute for any cutoff of U.S.
weaponry and support. [It would take a decade or more for these nations
to end their dependence on U.S. arms]{.mark}. [A few deals]{.mark} with
Moscow or Beijing [would have limited impact]{.mark} on Saudi and UAE
military capabilities]{.underline}, if Russia and China were even
willing to supply arms to two nations that are responsible for the
world's worst humanitarian catastrophe, with the international
opprobrium that would accompany any decision to do so. President Trump's
favorite argument for keeping the weapons trade going is jobs, jobs,
jobs. His claims of U.S. jobs tied to Saudi arms sales and related deals
have fluctuated widely, from 40,000 to as many as one million. But an
analysis of actual deals concluded over the past two years suggests a
figure that is a fraction of the president's claims. And many of these
jobs will be created in Saudi Arabia as part of that nation's goal of
having 50 percent of the value of its arms purchases produced in the
kingdom by 2030. [Last but not least is the claim that stopping arms
sales to the Saudi/UAE coalition will aid Iran. But the [Houthi-led
opposition is by no means a proxy for Tehran. They]{.mark} have
longstanding grievances that have nothing to do with Iran's limited
military support and [would be fighting no matter what posture Iran
takes]{.mark} towards the conflict. [If anything, the]{.mark} brutal
Saudi/UAE [intervention is driving the Houthi coalition closer to
Tehran]{.mark}. The best way to undercut Iranian influence in Yemen is
to support UN efforts to end the war.]{.underline}

#### No transition to Russian or Chinese arms\-\-- conflict in Yemen requires a constant flow of US weapons

Josh **Rogin 18**, a columnist for the Global Opinions section of The
Washington Post. He writes about foreign policy and national security.
Rogin is also a political analyst for CNN, 10/16/19, "Trump has it
'totally and completely backwards' on Saudi arms sales,"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2018/10/16/trump-has-it-totally-and-completely-backwards-on-saudi-arms-sales/?utm_term=.8ef64446344d

[When President [Trump]{.mark} argues that the United States can't halt
arms sales to Saudi Arabia over the Saudis' alleged murder of journalist
and Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi, he['s giving up a key piece of
leverage]{.mark} over Riyadh for no reason at all. What's worse, Trump
is also turning one of America's best strategic assets into a liability,
a massive unforced error that could weaken the United States
worldwide.]{.underline} Trump has said repeatedly he doesn't want to
halt --- or even threaten to halt --- U.S. arms sales to the Saudi
regime because (he says) it would cost U.S. jobs and hand over a sweet
contract to Moscow or Beijing. "They are ordering military equipment.
Everybody in the world wanted that order. Russia wanted it, China wanted
it, we wanted it. We got it," Trump said on "60 Minutes" Sunday. "I
don't want to hurt jobs. I don't want to lose an order like that." Set
aside that Trump's claim of \$110 billion of arms sales to Saudi Arabia
as announced last year is hugely exaggerated, considering that number
mostly refers to deals struck during the Obama administration and new
deals that haven't yet materialized. [[The]{.mark} significant
[arms-sales relationship we]{.mark} do [have with Saudi Arabia gives us
enormous leverage]{.mark} over them]{.underline}, leverage Trump should
use to pressure King Salman to reveal what his regime knows about
Khashoggi's disappearance. [[Saudi Arabia's military is already built
around U.S.]{.mark} and British [defense platforms, meaning they can't
easily switch]{.mark} to Russian or Chinese
[systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Riyadh is especially dependent on U.S.
arms]{.mark} right now [because]{.mark} their bloody war in [Yemen
requires a constant flow of U.S. munitions]{.mark}, not to mention U.S.
[intelligence,]{.mark} maintenance [and r]{.mark}efueling
[support.]{.mark} U.S. arms sales are not simply a financial deal or a
jobs program; they represent a strategic advantage of the United States.
Countries want U.S. weapons because they are the best. That gives us
connections, influence and, yes, leverage over these
countries.]{.underline} That's how arms sales have always worked, until
Trump flipped the script. "[The White House seems to be saying that
Trump Doctrine is that the U.S. will ignore your human rights abuses,
assassinations or war crimes as long as you buy things from us. He's got
it totally and completely backwards]{.underline}," Sen. Chris Murphy
(D-Conn.) told me. "[What's the point of being a military superpower if
we lose leverage when we do business with another country?]{.underline}"
"What the president doesn't realize is that this makes him look weak and
small. [[World leaders will]{.mark} now [know they can act with impunity
so long as they are buying]{.mark} American
[weapon]{.mark}s]{.underline}. That's an insane message to send," Murphy
said. "[The United States should never be boxed in because of who we
sell weapons to --- countries who buy U.S. weapons should feel enormous
pressure to stay on our good side.]{.underline}"

### 1AR- US weapons key 

#### Russia and China have not developed the necessary weapons to fill the gap 

Johnathan **Caverley 18**, an associate professor at the United States
Naval War College and a research scientist at M.I.T, 10/12/18, "Want to
Punish Saudi Arabia? Cut Off Its Weapons Supply,"
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/12/opinion/saudi-arabia-arms-sales.html

[If American officials really want to encourage a change in Saudi
policy, they should begin by looking at Saudi Arabia's largest imports
from the United States: weaponry. [Cutting off the flow of]{.mark}
American [arms to Saudi Arabia would be an effective way to]{.mark} put
[pressure]{.mark} on [Riyadh with little cost to]{.mark} the American
[economy or]{.mark} national [security.]{.mark}]{.underline} President
Trump, however, is skeptical. "I don't like stopping massive amounts of
money that's being poured into our country," he said on Thursday. "They
are spending \$110 billion on military equipment and on things that
create jobs for this country." This figure is vastly inflated, but
there's a reason Mr. Trump is inclined to believe it. While the amount
of new deals approved under President Trump is closer to \$20 billion,
the Saudi government has visibly linked itself as the foremost client of
the administration's export push. Peter Navarro, the White House's
director of trade and industrial policy, has argued that increased arms
sales "will be an important catalyst for strengthening American
industry; the stewardship of our national security; and the
strengthening of our international partnerships." But the truth is that
in the case of Saudi Arabia, the benefits on all three fronts are
slight. [Despite recent increases, [Saudi arms]{.mark} orders [remain a
manageably small part of]{.mark} the United States' [exports.]{.mark}
According to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, in 2017, a
near-record year for annual purchases, the United States delivered \$5.5
billion worth of arms, 20 percent of all foreign military sales. That
may sound like a lot, but the United States exports only 25 to 30
percent of its defense industry production, so exports to Saudi Arabia
clearly remain a relatively small slice of the enormous defense
industrial pie.]{.underline} And contrary to President Trump's
statement, exports to Saudi Arabia create relatively few American jobs.
[Based on Commerce Department figures, releasing the billion dollars of
munitions currently on hold in the Senate would "create or sustain"
fewer than 4,000 jobs]{.underline}. Here's a more specific example:
Publicizing a recent \$6 billion helicopter deal with Saudi Arabia,
Lockheed Martin predicted that it would "support" 450 American jobs. [To
date [these sales have not "stewarded]{.mark} our national [security."
Beyond]{.mark} its tragic war in [Yemen, Saudi Arabia has blockaded
Qatar]{.mark}, an ally that hosts the Middle East's largest American
military base. [And]{.mark} Saudi Arabia [provides little help when it
comes to]{.mark} Washington's real [regional priorities, such as]{.mark}
[fighting the Islamic State and stabilizing Iraq]{.mark}.]{.underline}
The Pentagon's National Defense Strategy specifically de-emphasizes the
war on terror to focus on competition with China and Russia. [Perhaps
selling weapons "strengthens international partnerships," as Mr. Navarro
put it]{.underline}, or at least discourages Saudi Arabia from finding
different ones. Mr. Trump on Thursday cited "four or five alternatives"
to American weapons, and the need to avoid "letting Russia have that
money and letting China have that money." [This, however, is unlikely
even in the long term.]{.underline} Saudi Arabia is in the middle of a
major war, and more than 60 percent of its arms deliveries over the past
five years came from the United States. The Saudi military relies not
just on American tanks, planes and missiles but for a daily supply of
maintenance, training and support, such as intelligence and refueling.
[In the longer term, almost all of Saudi Arabia's remaining exports come
from Europe. To truly squeeze Saudi Arabia, a coordinated embargo ---
much like the one now in place against Russia --- would be necessary but
relatively easy. European governments already feel strong domestic
political pressure not to export to regimes like Saudi Arabia.
[Transforming the]{.mark} Saudi [military to employ Russian, much less
Chinese, weapons would cost a fortune]{.mark} even by Gulf standards,
would require years of retraining [and would greatly reduce its military
power]{.mark} for a generation. [Russia cannot produce
next-generation]{.mark} fighter [aircraft, tanks and i]{.mark}nfantry
fighting [vehicles]{.mark} for its own armed forces, much less for the
export market. [China has not produce]{.mark}d, never mind exported, the
sophisticated [aircraft and missile defense systems]{.mark} Saudi Arabia
wants. Last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo certified that Saudi
Arabia was minimizing civilian casualties in the Yemen air campaign
apparently to avoid jeopardizing \$2 billion in weapons sales. That
small number does not show how powerful the Saudis are so much as how
cheaply the United States can be bought. Given these sales' low domestic
economic impact and the enormous costs of going elsewhere for Saudi
Arabia, the United States has the preponderance of influence in this
arms trade relationship. It should act accordingly.]{.underline}

#### Saudi Arabia is locked into US weapons and US weapons are superior 

Terrence **Guay 18**, Clinical Professor of International Business,
Pennsylvania State University, 10/19/19, "Arms sales to Saudi Arabia
give Trump all the leverage he needs in Khashoggi affair,"
https://theconversation.com/arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia-give-trump-all-the-leverage-he-needs-in-khashoggi-affair-104998

[While it's true that Russia and China are indeed major exporters of
armaments, the claim that U.S. weapons can easily be replaced by other
suppliers is not -- at least not in the short term.]{.underline} First,
[o[nce a country is "locked in" to a]{.mark} specific kind of weapons
[system]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} such as planes, tanks or naval
vessels, [[the cost to switch]{.mark} to a different supplier [can be
huge]{.mark}. Military [personnel must be retrained]{.mark} on new
equipment, spare parts need to be replaced, [and operational changes may
be necessary]{.mark}. After being so reliant on U.S. weapons systems for
decades, [the transition costs]{.mark} to buy from another country
[could be prohibitive]{.mark} even [for]{.mark} oil-rich [Saudi
Arabia]{.mark}. The second problem with Trump's argument is that
[armaments from Russia, China or elsewhere are]{.mark} simply [not as
sophisticated]{.mark} as U.S. weapons, which is why they are usually
cheaper]{.underline} -- though the quality gap is quickly decreasing.
[[To maintain its military superiority]{.mark} in the Middle East,
[Saudi Arabia has opted to purchase virtually all of its weapons from
America]{.mark}n and European companies. That is why the U.S. has
significant leverage in this aspect of the relationship. Any Saudi
threat to retaliate against a ban on U.S. arms sales by buying weapons
from countries that have not raised concerns about the Khashoggi
disappearance would not be credible.]{.underline} And is probably why,
despite worries in the White House, such a threat has not yet been made.

#### No switch---Saudi Arabia is too dependent on the US for security 

Nabeel **Khoury 18**, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic
Council's Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East, 10/23/19, "Oil, Arms,
and Counterterrorism: A Look At Saudi Options and How Far the Kingdom
May Go,"
[[https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/oil-arms-and-counterterrorism-a-look-at-saudi-options-and-how-far-the-kingdom-may-go]{.underline}](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/oil-arms-and-counterterrorism-a-look-at-saudi-options-and-how-far-the-kingdom-may-go)

[[Saudi Arabia]{.mark}, however, [ha]{.mark}s in the process [upped the
percentage of its purchases]{.mark} from Europe and the United States
[to 98 percent]{.mark} of its overall arms imports. [This is a]{.mark}
significant [dependency that would be]{.mark} very hard, if not
[impossible, to break]{.mark}. [Saudi Arabia's attempts to
diversify]{.mark} its sources of weaponry [has]{.mark} thus far [been
unsuccessful]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[This dependency goes beyond mere dollar figures and percentages to the
difficulty of changing weapon systems, personnel training, and war
strategies. Here the dependency is total because while [European weapons
can easily be made interoperable with US weapons]{.mark}, [this is not
the case with weapons]{.mark} purchased [from Russia and China]{.mark}.
The [Saudis would need]{.mark} an []{.mark}entirely [different]{.mark}
approach and [training for their military]{.mark} forces.]{.underline}

Bruce Riedel, the author of Kings and Presidents, a book that narrates
the story of Saudi dependency on the United States, says that [of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, Saudi Arabia would have the
most difficulty in switching over to a different system of security and
weaponry.]{.underline}

[This Saudi dependency is not new. The kingdom has relied on the United
States for its security since the very beginning, when Franklin D.
Roosevelt struck an oil versus security arrangement with King Abdulaziz
toward the end of World War II.]{.underline}

In stressing the need to maintain good relations with Saudi Arabia,
Trump has asserted 500,000 US jobs would be at stake should the Saudis
stop buying US arms---an inflated figure even according to State
Department assessments.

[The United States is, in fact, the only country in the world that could
sustain a weapons industry with purchases needed for its own
military.]{.underline}
