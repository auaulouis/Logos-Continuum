#### A Dem will win in 2020 -- trump has lost ground with key constituents 

**Fox News, 6/12**/2019 (Fox News Staff, "Poll shows top Dems lead Trump
in matchups,"
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/poll-shows-top-dems-lead-trump-in-matchups)

**[POLL SHOWS TOP DEMS LEAD TRUMP]{.underline}** IN MATCHUPS Quinnipiac
University: "[In a first look at head-to-head 2020 presidential
matchups]{.underline} nationwide, [several Democratic challengers lead
President]{.underline} Donald [Trump]{.underline}, [with]{.underline}
former Vice President Joseph [Biden ahead 53]{.underline} - [40
percent]{.underline}, [according to a Quinnipiac University National
Poll]{.underline} released \[Tuesday\]. In other matchups, the
independent Quinnipiac University National Poll finds: Vermont Sen.
Bernie [Sanders over]{.underline} President [Trump 51 - 42
percent]{.underline}; California Sen. Kamala [Harris ahead of Trump 49 -
41 percent]{.underline}; Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth [Warren tops Trump
49 - 42 percent]{.underline}; South Bend Mayor Pete [Buttigieg edges
Trump 47 - 42 percent]{.underline}; New Jersey Sen. Cory [Booker by a
nose over Trump 47 - 42 percent]{.underline}. In the Trump-Biden
matchup, women back Biden 60 - 34 percent, as men are divided with 47
percent for Biden and 46 percent for Trump. White voters are divided
with 47 percent for Trump and 46 percent for Biden." Kraushaar: 'Why
Trump isn't likely to win a second term' - National Journal: "**[Trump
is in the weakest political shape of any sitting president
since]{.underline}** George **[H.W. Bush]{.underline}**. Despite a
historically strong economy, [his job approval ratings are]{.underline}
still badly [underwater]{.underline}. ... [At least 40 percent of voters
are fired up to vote against him, no matter what]{.underline} happens in
the next year. [He's already lost ground]{.underline} with the
working-class voters who defected from the Democrats to support him in
2016, [with his favorability rating dropping 19 points among that
critical Obama-Trump constituency]{.underline} in the last two years.
... Trump's clearest path to victory relies on Democrats making a series
of self-destructive decisions. But [even if Democrats]{.underline} turn
leftward and [nominate a weak challenger, they'd still have a credible
chance at unseating Trump]{.underline}. The country's rampant
polarization guarantees that anyone---no matter how extreme---would be
well-positioned against the president."

#### Arms sales are a key issue in the election -- large dem primary makes it a focal point and it can unite swing voters

**Demirjian, 2019** (Karoun, Congressional reporter focusing on national
security, "In Saudi rebuke, Democrats see a path to unseat Trump in
2020," Washington Post, March 23,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/in-saudi-rebuke-democrats-see-a-path-to-unseat-trump-in-2020/2019/03/23/3e059dfe-4bdf-11e9-9663-00ac73f49662_story.html?utm_term=.d81bed2abc96)

[Congress is poised to pass its]{.underline} first war-powers
[resolution ordering an end to U.S. involvement in hostilities
overseas]{.underline}, [rebuking]{.underline} President [Trump's embrace
of Saudi Arabia]{.underline} [and **handing Democrats**]{.underline}
what they consider **[a vital component of their strategy
for]{.underline}** challenging him in **[2020]{.underline}**. Trump's
strained relations with traditional allies in Europe, his warm words for
Russia and his unpredictable approach to the Middle East have triggered
broad bipartisan efforts to blunt his actions. But
[Democrats]{.underline} [and Republicans remain]{.underline} mostly
[divided over restraining U.S. military support for the Saudi-led
bombing campaign in Yemen]{.underline}, where [a humanitarian crisis has
raised questions]{.underline} [about]{.underline} the moral and
strategic [costs of seeking lucrative weapons deals and enabling foreign
wars]{.underline}, even as lawmakers appear set to send Trump their
resolution. [Foreign policy is not traditionally a marquee campaign
issue]{.underline}, nor is Congress usually the forum to forge
presidential platforms. [But with seven currently serving Democratic
lawmakers hoping to replace Trump]{.underline}, **[such
votes]{.underline}** on Capitol Hill matter and **[could set the agenda
for the party as a whole]{.underline}**. "[National security is a huge
opportunity for Democrats in 2020 because of how ham-handed]{.underline}
President [Trump has been in his relationships with the world,"
said]{.underline} Sen. Chris [Murphy]{.underline} (D-Conn.), who was
among the earliest and most vocal agitators for a new approach to Saudi
Arabia. ["If we don't run a candidate who wants to talk about foreign
policy]{.underline}," he added, "**[we're missing an
opportunity]{.underline}**." The United States has provided Saudi-led
forces with logistical support and intelligence since 2015, aid aimed at
beating back the rise of Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen's civil
war. Critics say the campaign has targeted civilians and choked off
desperately needed humanitarian supplies, leaving more than 20 million
Yemenis at risk of starvation. Under pressure, the Trump administration
announced late last year that it would stop refueling Saudi aircraft.
But lawmakers in the House and the Senate have since secured votes on
Yemen-focused resolutions to cease everything but intelligence sharing
with the Saudis, a rebuke inspired in part by the killing of Saudi
journalist and Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi. Thus far,
seven Republicans have supported those efforts in the Senate, and 18 in
the House, along with the full roster of Democrats in both chambers. It
took a few years for these efforts to challenge U.S. activity in Yemen
--- a mission begun under the Obama administration --- to move from a
fringe issue in Democratic politics to one that party lawmakers fully
support. Most Democrats made the shift in response to Trump's early and
unapologetic embrace of Saudi Arabia even as Yemen's humanitarian crisis
worsened. Khashoggi's killing last fall, and Trump's subsequent defense
of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman despite intelligence
assessments indicating he had ordered the slaying, fully solidified
Democratic opposition to the Yemen venture. The subject has been
thornier for Republicans, who have condemned Saudi leaders over
Khashoggi's killing but wavered on whether to pull support for the
military campaign as the president is expected to veto any congressional
attempt to do so. Even those critical of the fight in Yemen have balked
at endorsing a war-powers resolution because there are no U.S. ground
troops there backing Saudi-led efforts against the Houthis --- and
because bipartisan efforts to limit arms sales to Saudi Arabia don't
have buy-in from party leaders. [As Republicans wrestle with the issue,
Democrats have taken it to the campaign trail]{.underline}. Within days
of Khashoggi's disappearance in Turkey last October, Sen. Bernie Sanders
(I-Vt.), who wrote the Senate's war-powers resolution, listed Yemen ---
along with Afghanistan and Iraq --- as the United States' most troubling
military boondoggles. In a speech at Johns Hopkins's School of Advanced
International Studies, he declared that "Saudi Arabia is a country
clearly inspired by Trump" and that it pursued the "catastrophic" war in
Yemen, along with Khashoggi's killing and other controversial ventures
because its crown prince "feels emboldened by the Trump administration's
unquestioning support." The next month, Sen. Elizabeth
[Warren]{.underline} (D-Mass.) delivered a foreign policy speech at
American University in which she [said that Trump "refused to halt arms
sales to Saudi Arabia in part because he is more interested in appeasing
U.S. defense contractors than holding the Saudis
accountable]{.underline}." "American security and American values should
come ahead of the profit margins of these private companies," she
continued. "Foreign policy should not be run exclusively by the
Pentagon." Though other congressional Democrats running for president
have yet to make similar speeches outlining their foreign policy vision,
they have --- in tweets and in votes --- expressed exasperation with and
called for reexamining the alliance with Saudi Arabia. Experienced
[Democratic strategists are urging party candidates to make Trump's
dealings with Riyadh a litmus test]{.underline} on the president's
character. "It puts on display what so many Americans across the country
really detest about the Trump administration: It's rejection of American
values, it's putting the interest of an autocratic kingdom ahead of our
own," said Ned Price, a spokesman for National Security Action, a group
of former Obama administration and Hillary Clinton campaign officials
who have offered foreign policy advice to 2020 candidates. Politically,
Trump's closeness to Saudi leaders is comparable to his praising Russian
President Vladimir Putin, Price said, in that it's "a question of what,
precisely, is the motivation of people --- including the president and
his son-in-law" Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to the president, whose
closeness with the Saudi crown prince has aroused suspicion among the
administration's critics, given reports that businesses tied to Kushner
and his relatives have sought investment from Saudi Arabia and other
Persian Gulf nations. [Democrats believe they can use the party's stance
on Yemen and Saudi Arabia to pitch a new foreign policy vision for the
country]{.underline} --- one that prioritizes diplomacy and economic
engagement over a heavy reliance on the military and related industries.
[Moving away from global military engagement has been a longtime
rallying cry for far-left and far-right outside groups]{.underline}
advocating for withdrawal from Yemen long before Sanders and Sen. Mike
Lee (R-Utah) drafted the Senate's version of the war-powers resolution.

#### The plan is a win for trump that breaks dem momentum and swings the election

**Yglesias, 2018** (Matthew, "How Trump could win in 2020," Vox,
September 26,
https://www.vox.com/2018/9/26/17905752/trump-2020-strategy)

[What if]{.underline} President [Trump did popular stuff]{.underline} on
policy? In particular, [what if Democrats do well]{.underline} in the
midterms and take the House [and start passing bills]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} then [Trump]{.underline} takes their most popular
ideas and [agrees with them]{.underline}? Or at least with watered-down
versions of them? So maybe Trump signs a bill to hike the minimum wage
to \$12 an hour, a deficit-financed surge in infrastructure spending,
some version of a DREAM Act paired to wall funding, and maybe even
something like the Manchin-Toomey background check bill. Up until now,
Trump has governed like a very hardline conservative except on trade.
But except for authoritarian views on immigration and crime, [Trump
doesn't have any personal history of consistency as a
conservative.]{.underline} And even during his 2016 campaign, he put
forth a much more eclectic, heterodox version of himself than how he's
governed. Of course, maybe that won't change no matter what happens in
2018. Maybe he's a true prisoner of the conservative movement. Maybe
he's always harbored Heritage Foundation sympathies and they are just
now blooming. But I think a reasonable person should have some humility
about his ability to foresee the future and admit that this bipartisan,
populist Trump is at least a possibility. Trump's path to victory One
immediate consequence of this would be that it would give guys like Ben
Sasse and Mike Lee, who sometimes like to position themselves as more
high-minded than Trump, the opportunity to actually vote against the
president sometimes. Any Trump-Pelosi deal could easily weather a dozen
or so defections from the right that would allow that crew to own the
brand of "true conservatives" without needing to do anything to check
Trump's corruption or authoritarianism. Conversely, it would greatly
empower the left of the Democratic Party because it would cost more
moderate factions their resistance branding. [Trump's electoral base
wouldn't mind a handful of ideological betrayals since rank-and-file
Republicans are really here for the culture war stuff]{.underline} and
not for the concrete policy anyway. [So Trump would enter the 2020
campaign with his base intact but also with the brand as a freethinking
moderate]{.underline} who's at odds with the right wing of congressional
Republicans. Democrats would end up nominating someone with a relatively
extreme rejectionist profile, and [Trump would be in a good position to
improve his approval ratings and get reelected.]{.underline} Think of it
as basically a rerun of Bill Clinton in 1995-'96 with "triangulation."
Now, of course, there are other historical models. Richard Nixon signed
a lot of moderately progressive legislation to try to salvage his
presidency, and it didn't work. And the fairly productive Bush-Pelosi
110th Congress didn't restore the GOP's popularity. Anyway, who knows?
But I think [the odds of a Trump rebound are underrated]{.underline}.

#### Trump victory locks in inevitable climate change

**Starr, 2019** (Paul, professor of sociology and public affairs at
Princeton and a winner of the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction,
"Trump's Second Term," The Atlantic, May,
https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/05/trump-2020-second-term/585994/)

Of all the questions that will be answered by the 2020 election, one
matters above the others: Is Trumpism a temporary aberration or a
long-term phenomenon? Put another way: Will the changes brought about by
Donald Trump and today's Republican Party fade away, or will they become
entrenched? [Trump's reelection seems implausible]{.underline} to many
people, as implausible as his election did before November 2016.
[But]{.underline} despite the scandals and chaos of his presidency, and
despite his party's midterm losses, [he approaches 2020 with two factors
in his favor]{.underline}. [One is incumbency]{.underline}: Since 1980,
voters have only once denied an incumbent a second term. [The other is a
relatively strong economy]{.underline} (at least as of now). Alan
Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University who weights both
of those factors heavily in his election-forecasting model, gives Trump
close to an even chance of reelection, based on a projected 2 percent
GDP growth rate for the first half of 2020. So far, much of the concern
about the long-term effects of Trump's presidency has centered on his
antidemocratic tendencies. But even if we take those off the
table---[even if we assume that Trump continues to be hemmed in by other
parts of the government and]{.underline} by [outside
institutions]{.underline}, and that he governs no more effectively than
he has until now---[the impact of a second term would be more lasting
than that of the first.]{.underline} In normal politics, the policies
adopted by a president and Congress may zig one way, and those of the
next president and Congress may zag the other. The contending parties
take our system's rules as a given, and fight over what they understand
to be reversible policies and power arrangements. But some situations
are not like that; a zig one way makes it hard to zag back. This is one
of those moments. [After four years as president, Trump will have made
at least two Supreme Court appointments, signed into law tax cuts, and
rolled back federal regulation of the environment and the
economy]{.underline}. Whatever you think of these actions, [many of them
can probably be offset or entirely undone in the future]{.underline}.
**[The effects of a full eight years of Trump will be]{.underline}**
much more difficult, if not **[impossible, to undo]{.underline}**. Three
areas---climate change, the risk of a renewed global arms race, and
control of the Supreme Court---illustrate the historic significance of
the 2020 election. The first two problems will become much harder to
address as time goes on. The third one stands to remake our
constitutional democracy and undermine the capacity for future change.
In short, [the biggest difference between electing Trump in 2016 and
reelecting Trump in 2020 would be irreversibility. **Climate policy is
now the most obvious example**]{.underline}. For a long time, even many
of the people who acknowledged the reality of climate change thought of
it as a slow process that did not demand immediate action. But today,
[amid extreme weather events and worsening scientific forecasts, the
costs of our delay are clearly mounting]{.underline}, [as are the
associated dangers]{.underline}. [To have a chance at keeping global
warming below 1.5 degrees]{.underline} Celsius---the objective of the
Paris climate agreement---the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
says that [by 2030,]{.underline} [CO2 emissions must drop some 45
percent from 2010 levels]{.underline}. Instead of declining, **[however,
they are rising]{.underline}**. [In his first term, Trump has announced
plans to cancel existing climate reforms]{.underline}, [such
as]{.underline} higher [fuel-efficiency standards and limits on
emissions from]{.underline} new [coal]{.underline}-fired power
[plants]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} he has [pledged to pull the
United States out of the Paris Agreement]{.underline}. [His reelection
would put off a national commitment to decarbonization until at least
the second half of the 2020s]{.underline}, [while encouraging other
countries to do nothing]{.underline} as well. And change that is delayed
becomes more economically and politically difficult. [According to the
Global Carbon Project, if decarbonization had begun]{.underline}
globally [in 2000, an emissions reduction of about 2 percent a year
would have been sufficient]{.underline} to stay below 2 degrees Celsius
of warming. Now it will need to be approximately 5 percent a year. **[If
we wait another decade, it will be about 9 percent]{.underline}**. [In
the United States, the economic disruption and popular resistance sure
to arise from such an abrupt transition may be more than our political
system can bear]{.underline}. [No one knows, moreover, when the world
might hit irreversible tipping points]{.underline} such as the collapse
of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, [which would likely doom
us]{.underline} to a catastrophic sea-level rise.

#### Warming causes extinction

**Klein '17** - former Miliband Fellow, lectured at the London School of
Economics on the anti-globalization movement, social activist, and
filmmaker known for her political analyses and criticism of corporate
globalization and of capitalism (Naomi, "No is not enough: Resisting
Trump's shock politics and winning the world we need," pg. 68-70)

[The stakes in the 2016 election were enormously high]{.underline} for a
great many reasons, from the millions who stood to lose their health
insurance to those targeted by racist attacks as Trump fanned the flames
of rising white nationalism; from the families that stood to be torn
apart by cruel immigration policies to the prospect of women losing the
right to decide whether or not to become mothers, to the reality of
sexual assault being normalized and trivialized at the highest reaches
of power. With so many lives on the line, there is nothing to be gained
by ranking issues by urgency and playing "my crisis is bigger than your
crisis." If it's happening to you, if it's your family being torn apart
or you who is being singled out for police harassment, or your
grandmother who cannot afford a life-saving treatment, or your drinking
water that's laced with lead---it's all a five-alarm fire. Climate
change isn't more important than any of these other issues, but it does
have a different relationship to time. [When the politics of climate
change go wrong]{.underline}---and they are very, very wrong right
now---[we don't get to try again in four years. Because in four years
the earth will have been radically changed by all the gases emitted in
the interim, and our chances of averting an irreversible catastrophe
will have shrunk. This may sound alarmist, but]{.underline} I have
interviewed the [leading scientists]{.underline} in the world on this
question, and their [research shows that it's simply a neutral
description of reality. The window during which there is time to lower
emissions sufficiently to avoid truly catastrophic warming is **closing
rapidly**]{.underline}. Lots of social movements have adopted Samuel
Beckett's famous line "Try again. Fail again. Fail better" as a
lighthearted motto. I've always liked the attitude; we can't be perfect,
we won't always win, but we should strive to improve. The trouble is,
Beckett's dictum doesn't work for climate---not at this stage in the
game. [If we keep failing to lower emissions, if we keep failing to
kick-start the transition in earnest away from fossil fuels]{.underline}
and to an economy based on renewables, [if we keep dodging the question
of wasteful consumption and the quest for more and more and bigger and
bigger, there won't be more opportunities to fail better]{.underline}.
Nearly [everything is moving faster than the climate change modeling
projected]{.underline}, including Arctic sea-ice loss, ice-sheet
collapse, ocean warming, sea-level rise, and coral bleaching. The next
time voters in countries around the world go to the polls, more sea ice
will have melted, more coastal land will have been lost, more species
will have disappeared for good. The chance for us to keep temperatures
below what it would take for island nations such as, say, Tuvalu or the
Maldives to be saved from drowning becomes that much slimmer. These are
irreversible changes---we don't get a do-over on a drowned country. The
latest peer-reviewed science tells us that if we want a good shot at
protecting coastal cities in my son's lifetime---including metropolises
like New York City and Mumbai---then we need to get off fossil fuels
with superhuman speed. A paper from Oxford University that came out
during the campaign, published in the Applied Energy journal, concluded
that for humanity to have a fifty-fifty chance of meeting the
temperature targets set in the climate accord negotiated in Paris at the
end of 2015, every new power plant would have to be zero-carbon starting
in 2018. That's the second year of the Trump presidency. For most of
us---including me---this is very hard information to wrap our heads
around, because we are used to narratives that reassure us about the
inevitability of eventual progress. Martin Luther King Jr. said, "The
arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice." It's a
powerful idea that sadly doesn't work for the climate crisis. The
wealthy governments of the world have procrastinated for so long, and
made the problem so much worse in the meantime, [that the arc has to
bend **very, very fast now**---or the shot at justice is gone for
good]{.underline}. [We are almost at midnight on the climate
clock]{.underline}. Not Just Another Election Cycle---Epic Bad Timing
During the Democratic primaries, I was really struck by the moment when
a young woman confronted Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail and asked
her if---given the scale of the global warming crisis---she would pledge
not to take any more money from the fossil fuel interests that are
supercharging it. Up to that point, Clinton's campaign had received
large sums of money from employees and registered lobbyists of fossil
fuel companies---about \$1.7 million, according to Greenpeace's
research. Clinton looked disgusted and snapped at the young woman,
saying she was "so sick" of this issue coming up. A few days later, in
an interview, Clinton said young people should "do their own research."
The woman who had asked the question, Eva Resnick-Day, worked as a
campaigner for Greenpeace. She had done her research, she insisted, "and
that is why we are so terrified for the future.... [What happens in the
next four]{.underline} or eight [years could **determine the future of
our planet and the human species.**]{.underline}" For me, her words cut
to the heart of why this was not just another election cycle. Why it was
not only legitimate but necessary to question Hillary's web of corporate
entanglements. Resnick-Day's comments also highlight one of the big
reasons why Trump's presidency is harrowing: the most powerful man in
the world is a person who says global warming is a hoax invented by the
Chinese, and who is feverishly trashing the (already inadequate)
restraints on fossil fuels that his country had put in place,
encouraging other governments to do the same. And [it's]{.underline} all
[happening at the worst possible time in human history. We have so far
warmed the planet by just one degree Celsius]{.underline}, and from
that, [we are already seeing dramatic results]{.underline}: the mass
coral die-off, balmy Arctic weather leading to severe ice loss, the
breaking apart of Antarctic ice sheets. [If we continue on our current
pollution trajectory, we are set to warm the planet by **four to six
degrees** Celsius]{.underline}. The climate scientist and emissions
expert Kevin Anderson says that [four degrees of warming is
"**incompatible with any reasonable characterization of an organized,
equitable and civilized global community**.]{.underline}" That is why
governments came together in Paris and drew up an agreement to make
their best efforts to get off this dangerous course, and try to limit
warming to "well below" 2 degrees, pursuing efforts to keep it below 1.5
degrees. The high end of that temperature target represents double the
warming we have already experienced, so it's by no means safe.

### Impact Overview

#### Timeframe -- any delay locks in catastrophic warming. It's try or die for the neg

**Watts, 2018** (Jonathan, Global environment editor, "We have 12 years
to limit climate change catastrophe, warns UN," The Guardian, October,
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report)

[The world's leading climate scientists have warned there is only a
dozen years for global warming to be kept to a maximum of
1.5C]{.underline}, beyond which even half a degree will significantly
worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for
hundreds of millions of people. [The authors of the landmark report by
the UN]{.underline} Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
([IPCC)]{.underline} released on Monday [say urgent and unprecedented
changes are needed to reach the target]{.underline}, **[which they say
is affordable and feasible]{.underline}** although it lies at the most
ambitious end of the Paris agreement pledge to keep temperatures between
1.5C and 2C. The half-degree difference could also prevent corals from
being completely eradicated and ease pressure on the Arctic, according
to the 1.5C study, which was launched after approval at a final plenary
of all 195 countries in Incheon in South Korea that saw delegates
hugging one another, with some in tears. "[It's a line in the
sand]{.underline} and what it says to our species is that this is the
moment **[and we must act now]{.underline}**," [said]{.underline} Debra
[Roberts, a co-chair of the working group on impacts]{.underline}. "This
is the largest clarion bell from the science community and I hope it
mobilises people and dents the mood of complacency." Policymakers
commissioned the report at the Paris climate talks in 2016, but since
then [the gap between science and politics has widened.]{.underline}
Donald [Trump has promised to withdraw the US]{.underline} -- the
world's biggest source of historical emissions -- [from the
accord]{.underline}. The first round of Brazil's presidential election
on Sunday put Jair Bolsonaro into a strong position to carry out his
threat to do the same and also open the Amazon rainforest to
agribusiness. The world is currently 1C warmer than preindustrial
levels. Following devastating hurricanes in the US, record droughts in
Cape Town and forest fires in the Arctic, [the IPCC makes clear that
climate change is already happening, upgraded its risk
warning]{.underline} from previous reports, [and warned that **every
fraction of additional warming would worsen the impact**.]{.underline}
Scientists who reviewed the 6,000 works referenced in the report, said
the change caused by just half a degree came as a revelation. "We can
see there is a difference and it's substantial," Roberts said. At 1.5C
the proportion of the global population exposed to water stress could be
50% lower than at 2C, it notes. Food scarcity would be less of a problem
and hundreds of millions fewer people, particularly in poor countries,
would be at risk of climate-related poverty. At 2C extremely hot days,
such as those experienced in the northern hemisphere this summer, would
become more severe and common, increasing heat-related deaths and
causing more forest fires. But the greatest difference would be to
nature. Insects, which are vital for pollination of crops, and plants
are almost twice as likely to lose half their habitat at 2C compared
with 1.5C. Corals would be 99% lost at the higher of the two
temperatures, but more than 10% have a chance of surviving if the lower
target is reached. Sea-level rise would affect 10 million more people by
2100 if the half-degree extra warming brought a forecast 10cm additional
pressure on coastlines. The number affected would increase substantially
in the following centuries due to locked-in ice melt. [Oceans are
already suffering from elevated acidity and lower levels of
oxygen]{.underline} as a result of climate change. [One model shows
marine fisheries would lose 3m tonnes at 2C, twice the decline at
1.5C]{.underline}. Sea ice-free summers in the Arctic, which is warming
two to three times faster than the world average, would come once every
100 years at 1.5C, but every 10 years with half a degree more of global
warming. **[Time and carbon budgets are running out]{.underline}**. [By
mid-century, a shift to the lower goal would require a supercharged
roll-back of emissions sources]{.underline} that have built up over the
past 250 years. The IPCC maps out four pathways to achieve 1.5C, with
different combinations of land use and technological change.
Reforestation is essential to all of them as are shifts to electric
transport systems and greater adoption of carbon capture technology.
Carbon pollution would have to be cut by 45% by 2030 -- compared with a
20% cut under the 2C pathway -- and come down to zero by 2050, compared
with 2075 for 2C. This would require carbon prices that are three to
four times higher than for a 2C target. But the costs of doing nothing
would be far higher. "We have presented governments with pretty hard
choices. We have pointed out the enormous benefits of keeping to 1.5C,
and also the unprecedented shift in energy systems and transport that
would be needed to achieve that," said Jim Skea, a co-chair of the
working group on mitigation. "We show it can be done within laws of
physics and chemistry. Then the final tick box is political will. We
cannot answer that. Only our audience can -- and that is the governments
that receive it." **[He said the main finding of his group was the need
for urgency]{.underline}**. [Although unexpectedly good progress has
been made]{.underline} in the adoption of renewable energy,
deforestation for agriculture was turning a natural carbon sink into a
source of emissions. [Carbon capture and storage projects]{.underline},
which are essential for reducing emissions in the concrete and waste
disposal industries, [have also ground to a halt.]{.underline}

### Dems Win - Generic

#### Dems will win in 2020 -- consensus of polls in key battleground states

trailing Biden and four other Democrats,"
https://news.yahoo.com/poll-shows-trump-trailing-biden-four-other-democrats-164318873.html)

Washington (AFP) - [A nationwide Fox News poll released
Sunday]{.underline} [shows]{.underline} President Donald [Trump
trailing]{.underline} former vice president Joe [Biden and no fewer than
four other]{.underline} [Democratic contenders]{.underline} as early
campaigning for the 2020 election begins to gain steam. [A separate
survey of battleground states, by CBS, shows Democrats strongly favor
Biden]{.underline} as the candidate most likely to beat Trump in next
year\'s elections. [The Fox poll showed Biden leading Trump by 49
percent to 39 percent among all registered voters
nationwide]{.underline}, [while Senator Bernie Sanders held nearly the
same advantage]{.underline} over the president, at 49 percent to 40
percent. Holding edges of 1 or 2 points over Trump \-- albeit within the
poll\'s 3-point margin of error \-- were Senators Elizabeth Warren and
Kamala Harris, as well as Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana.
The polling comes more than 500 days before the November 3, 2020
election, an eternity in the political world. One widely viewed tweet
this week shows five presidential candidates in recent decades who
trailed at this point in their campaigns \-- including Trump \-- but who
went on to win. The president does not officially launch his re-election
campaign until Tuesday, at a rally-style event in a huge arena in
Orlando, Florida. - Battleground states - Still, [the Fox
poll]{.underline}, conducted June 9 to June 12, [is seen as heartening
by Democrats eager to chip away at Trump\'s popularity, particularly in
key battleground states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin]{.underline}.
[Trump\'s campaign recently dismissed leaked data from its own pollsters
showing Biden with double-digit leads in battleground
states.]{.underline} The campaign at first denied the data, but then
acknowledged it, branding it as \"ancient\" because it dated from March.
[But the new CBS poll confirms]{.underline} a clear Biden lead in
battleground states among Democratic voters, as the crowded race for
that party\'s nomination begins to take shape. A belief among Democratic
voters that Biden is best positioned to defeat Trump in 2020 was cited
by three-quarters of Democrats as a decisive factor in their support.

### Dems Win -- Turnout

#### Dems win now -- record minority turnout

**LeTorneau, 6/14**/2019 (Nancy, contributing writer at the Washington
Monthly since November 2014, "2020 Could Set Records for Voter Turnout,"
Washington Monthly,
https://washingtonmonthly.com/2019/06/14/2020-could-set-records-for-voter-turnout/)

[Talk of the 2020 election has focused primarily on
polling]{.underline}, whether it involves the Democratic primary or
potential face-to-face match-ups with Trump. [But]{.underline} Ron
[Brownstein took a look at something equally important: voter
turnout.]{.underline} Political scientists are forecasting a veritable
tsunami. [Signs are growing that]{.underline} **[voter turnout in 2020
could reach the highest levels]{.underline}** in decades---if not the
highest **[in the past century]{.underline}**---[with a surge of new
voters potentially producing the most diverse electorate in American
history]{.underline}... With Donald Trump's tumultuous presidency
stirring such strong emotions among both supporters and opponents,
[strategists in both parties]{.underline} and academic experts [are now
bracing for]{.underline} what Michael McDonald, a University of Florida
political scientist who specializes in voting behavior, recently called
"[a voter turnout storm of a century in 2020.]{.underline}" In a recent
paper, the Democratic voter-targeting firm Catalist projected that about
156 million people could vote in 2020, an enormous increase from the 139
million who cast ballots in 2016. Likewise, Public Opinion Strategies, a
leading Republican polling firm, recently forecast that the 2020 contest
could produce a massive turnout that is also unprecedentedly diverse.
[McDonald is forecasting that two-thirds]{.underline} (67 percent) [of
eligible voters will cast a ballot in 2020]{.underline}. Here is how
that compares with recent history. Since 18-year-olds were granted the
vote \[in 1972\], the highest showing was the 61.6 percent of eligible
voters who showed up in 2008, leading to Barack Obama's victory. And
since World War II, the highest turnout level came in 1960, with John F.
Kennedy's win, when 63.8 percent of voters participated. It is worth
noting that in both of those cases a young, dynamic Democrat was running
against an older establishment Republican. In one instance, the Democrat
went on to become the first Catholic president in the country's history,
while the other became the first African-American president. Recent
predictions are based on data points like the number of small
contributions to presidential campaigns, cable news viewership, and
polls indicating a high degree of interest in the election. But it also
reflects what happened in the 2018 midterms, in which 35 million more
people participated than in 2014. [Here is the good news for
Democrats]{.underline}. McDonald estimates that the number of eligible
voters increases by about 5 million each year, or about 20 million from
one presidential election to the next. That increase predominantly flows
from two sources: young people who turn 18 and immigrants who become
citizens. Since people of color are now approaching a majority of the
under-18 population---and also constitute most immigrants---[McDonald
and other experts believe it's likely that minorities represent a
majority of the people who have become eligible to vote since
2016]{.underline}. However, that only matters if the newly eligible
voters actually turn out on election day---which is exactly what
happened in 2018. [Turnout typically falls for all voter groups in
midterm elections compared with the previous presidential race, but that
falloff was much smaller than usual last year]{.underline}. Moreover,
while turnout surged across virtually all groups, it increased most
sharply among the voters who historically have participated at the
lowest levels. In addition to voter suppression, here is what
Republicans are counting on. The electorate is not diversifying nearly
as fast in the three Rust Belt states that Trump dislodged from the Blue
Wall---Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Those states, for years to
come, will remain older and whiter than the nation overall, meaning that
to win them, Democrats have to run better with older, whiter voters than
they do in most places. But [Trump faces an uphill battle
in]{.underline} those [Rust Belt states right now]{.underline}, where
[his approval rating stands at -7 in Pennsylvania, -12 in Michigan, and
-13 in Wisconsin]{.underline}. He's going to need to energize a lot of
angry white non-college-educated males in those states to turn that
around.

### Dems Win -- Hispanic Voters

#### Trump's low approval rating among key Hispanic voters means the dems win in 2020

**Drucker, 6/16**/2019 (David, senior political correspondent for the
Washington Examiner, "Hispanic resistance to Trump in Colorado and
Nevada complicates 2020 strategy," The Washington Examiner,
https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/hispanic-resistance-to-trump-in-colorado-and-nevada-complicates-2020-strategy)

**[Resistance by Hispanic voters to]{.underline}** President
**[Trump]{.underline}** in Colorado and Nevada, two critical White House
battlegrounds[**, could complicate**]{.underline} President [Trump's
path to **reelection**]{.underline}. [Trump won]{.underline} [his first
campaign]{.underline} [narrowly]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} on the
cusp of Tuesday's scheduled 2020 kickoff in Orlando [is facing
considerable headwinds in Midwestern states crucial to that
victory]{.underline}. To compensate and improve the president's odds of
a second term, the [Trump]{.underline} campaign is [preparing to expand
the map by pouring resources into Colorado and Nevada]{.underline}. But
flipping two Western melting pots that have voted Democratic in three
consecutive presidential elections could be a tall order for Trump.
[Despite Hispanic support for the president holding up nationally, in
Colorado and Nevada this significant and growing share of the electorate
is particularly troubled by his nationalist rhetoric and hard-line
border security policies]{.underline}. "[I don't know what he can do to
improve his numbers without any major moves on immigration
reform]{.underline}," [said]{.underline} Albert [Morales]{.underline},
senior political director with Latino Decisions, a liberal group that
studies the Hispanic vote. "We're not doing well in finding a message
that appeals," added Joe Heck, a Republican former congressman from Las
Vegas who lost his bid for a Senate seat in Nevada three years ago.
Across the country, public opinion surveys and exit polling from the
midterm elections saw Trump's support from Hispanics at roughly 30%,
about where it has been for Republicans since after the George W. Bush
administration. That's not great, but it's also not catastrophic, as
some had predicted for Trump during the 2016 campaign. [Beneath the
surface, the picture is more problematic for Trump]{.underline}. Some
Hispanics who vote in strong numbers, such as Cubans in Florida, give
him high marks, boosting him in a key battleground. But other
ethnicities, like the [Mexicans and Central Americans prevalent in
one-time swing states like Colorado and Nevada, view the president
poorly]{.underline}, **[making an uphill climb even
steeper]{.underline}**.

### Dems Win -- Trump

#### Dem victory now - Trump low approval means uniqueness can only go one way

**Yglesias, 6/12**/2019 (Matthew, Vox co-founder and senior
correspondent focused on politics and economic policy, "Trump's big
problem is that he's unpopular," Vox,
https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/12/18662196/trump-popularity-poll-democrats-2020)

[If you look at]{.underline} Donald [Trump's polling]{.underline}
lately, it sure looks like **[he's in trouble for
reelection]{.underline}**. A June 11 Quinnipiac poll showed Trump losing
40-53 to Joe Biden. He's also down 51-42 to Bernie Sanders, 41-49 to
Kamala Harris, 42-49 to Elizabeth Warren, 42-47 to Pete Buttigieg, and
42-47 to Cory Booker. [All plausible contenders at this moment can take
heart in the fact that just 40 to 42 percent]{.underline} [of the
population feels like voting for Trump]{.underline}'s reelection. The
public is mostly saying they want to vote for any Democrat, and the
strongest pattern so far indicates better-known Democrats do better than
the more obscure ones. [None of this means that Trump is a sure bet to
lose]{.underline} the election in 2020 --- public opinion can change
fast and there's nothing particularly predictive about polling this far
out --- [but it's a pretty clear snapshot of public opinion right
now.]{.underline} Trump, for now, is unpopular. FiveThirtyEight's's
polling average shows Trump currently has a 42 percent approval rating.
[He's unpopular and losing despite the huge field arrayed against
him;]{.underline} he's unpopular and losing [despite Democrats' confused
message on impeachment]{.underline}; [and]{.underline} he's unpopular
and losing [despite some very real continued ability to successfully
manipulate the media]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} head-to-head
[polling]{.underline} doesn't really tell us much about events 18 months
in the future, but it [does tell us there's no]{.underline}
counterintuitive [process whereby Trump secures the votes of tons of
people who say he's doing a bad job]{.underline} as president. He is
getting the votes of basically the exact same share of the population as
thinks he's doing a good job. And as of now, **[that doesn't look like
it's nearly enough people to win]{.underline}**.

### A2 UQ O/W the Link

#### The race is tight and could go either way

**Klein and Parks, 4/29**/2019 (Rick, Political Director of ABC News,
Maryalice, Former ABC News Frank Reynolds Fellow, "The Note: Democrats\'
path to 2020 victory paved with questions," ABC News,
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/note-democrats-path-2020-victory-paved-questions/story?id=62663677)

[Democrats are facing down a 2020 race that\'s very
winnable]{.underline}. **[But it\'s also a race that\'s extremely
loseable]{.underline}**. That\'s a key takeaway from the latest ABC
News/Washington Post poll numbers out Monday morning. [Consider: 55% of
voters]{.underline} \-- including 30% of self-described conservatives
\-- [said they will definitely not support President]{.underline} Donald
[Trump for reelection]{.underline}, [with Trump\'s approval rating stuck
at 39%]{.underline} despite the strong economy. [But of the never-Trump
voters]{.underline}, **[only 29% said they\'ll definitely vote for the
Democratic nominee.]{.underline}** [In the critical Midwest, 54% of
voters said they\'re open to supporting Trump]{.underline}.

#### The election will be close -- key indicators and incumbency boost trump despite low approval

**Porter, 2018** (Patrick, Chair in International Security and Strategy
at the University of Birmingham, "CRISIS AND CONVICTION: U.S. GRAND
STRATEGY IN TRUMP'S SECOND TERM," War on the Rocks, August 6,
https://warontherocks.com/2018/08/crisis-and-conviction-u-s-grand-strategy-in-trumps-second-term/)

[We would be wise to entertain the possibility of a second term of
Trump. Thus far, it has proven futile for Trump's critics to seek refuge
in wishful expectations that he would go away]{.underline}, a wish found
wanting every time it is updated. Recall that [critics have hoped Trump
wouldn't win the nomination]{.underline}; that he [would lose the
election]{.underline}; that he [would be impeached]{.underline}; [that
he will not stand again for office]{.underline}. The hope for a
post-Trump return to political normality is similarly vain. After Trump
there will likely be more Trumps, given the force of populist revolt
that he has stirred, and the general dissatisfaction with the alleged
liberal world order, whose breakdown and failures made Trumpism possible
in the first place. [There are good reasons to expect Trump to be a
strong contender for re-election]{.underline}. Since World War II,
[incumbency has been a strong force in U.S. presidential
politics]{.underline}. It has been rare for one of the two major parties
to hold the presidency for only one term. Consider too Trump's standing.
[His disapproval ratings are at historic highs, yet he also strongly
mobilizes his base]{.underline}. Donations to Trump's re-election
campaign flood in. Trump enjoys near record approval from Republican
voters, with no sign of mass defections. [As things stand, he can
campaign for a second term with a contentious but powerful story: a
booming economy, low unemployment, a rising stock market, strictly
enforced borders and tariff walls, and making peace through tough
confrontation of North Korea and Iran]{.underline}. Each of these claims
can be unpicked. But rebutting them takes explanation. In politics, if
you're explaining, you're failing. Trump may be fortunate that his
re-election timetable coincides with the right side of an economic "boom
bust" cycle. Were he to win a second term, and especially if the margin
was more decisive, the conditions of his presidency would change. If he
won big, he would have more political capital to spend. He would feel
vindicated by the authority of a second mandate. Term limits would mean
that he would no longer need fear election failure. It is possible that
Trump "Mark 2" would be more willing to tolerate the costs of
introducing major change in American grand strategy.

#### The plan is a popular victory -- most Americans reject interventionism and are opposed to arms sales

**Wittner, 2019** (Lawrence, Professor of History Emeritus at
SUNY/Albany, "Most Americans Actually Reject Trump's 'America First'
Policy," Common Dreams, April 26,
https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/04/26/most-americans-actually-reject-trumps-america-first-policy)

As president, Donald [Trump has leaned heavily upon what he's called an
"America First" policy]{.underline}. This nationalist approach involves
walking away from cooperative agreements with other nations and relying
instead upon a dominant role for the United States, undergirded by
military might, in world affairs. Nevertheless, [as numerous recent
opinion polls reveal, **most Americans don't support this
policy**]{.underline}. [The reaction of the American public to Trump's
withdrawal of the United States from key international agreements has
been hostile]{.underline}. According to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll
conducted in early May 2018, shortly before Trump announced a pullout
from the Iran nuclear agreement, 54 percent of respondents backed the
agreement. Only 29 percent favored a pullout. In July 2018, when the
Chicago Council on Global Affairs surveyed Americans about their
reaction to Trump's withdrawal from both the Iran deal and the Paris
climate agreement, it found that 66 favored remaining within the Iran
accord, while 68 percent favored remaining within the Paris accord ― an
increase of 6 percent in support for each of these agreements over the
preceding year. Most Americans also rejected Trump's 2019 withdrawal of
the United States from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF)
Treaty with Russia. A survey that February by the Chicago Council on
Global Affairs reported that 54 percent of Americans opposed withdrawal
from this nuclear arms control treaty and only 41 percent favored it.
Furthermore, when pollsters presented arguments for and against
withdrawal from the treaty to Americans before asking for their opinion,
66 percent opposed withdrawal. In addition, despite Trump's sharp
criticism of U.S. allies, most Americans expressed their support for a
cooperative relationship with them. The Chicago Council's July 2018
survey found that 66 percent of Americans agreed that the United States
should make decisions with its allies, even if it meant that the U.S.
government would have to go along with a policy other than its own. Only
32 percent disagreed. Similarly, a March 2019 Pew Research poll found
that 54 percent of American respondents wanted the U.S. government to
take into account the interests of its allies, even if that meant
compromising with them, while only 40 percent said the U.S. government
should follow its national interests when its allies strongly disagreed.
Moreover, despite the Trump administration's attacks upon the United
Nations and other international human rights entities ― including
pulling out of the UN Human Rights Council, withdrawing from UNESCO,
defunding UN relief efforts for Palestinians, and threatening to
prosecute the judges of the International Criminal Court ― public
support for international institutions remained strong. In July 2018, 64
percent of Americans surveyed told the Chicago Council's pollsters that
the United States should be more willing to make decisions within the
framework of the UN, even if that meant going along with a policy other
than its own. This was the highest level of agreement on this question
since 2004, when it was first asked. In February 2019, 66 percent of
U.S. respondents to a Gallup survey declared that the UN played "a
necessary role in the world today." But what about expanding U.S.
military power? Given the Trump administration's success at fostering a
massive military buildup, isn't there widespread enthusiasm about that?
On this point, too, the administration's priorities are strikingly out
of line with the views of most Americans. A National Opinion Research
Center (NORC) survey of U.S. public opinion, conducted from April
through November 2018, found that only 27 percent of respondents thought
that the U.S. government spent "too little" on the military, while 66
percent thought that it spent either "too much" or "about the right
amount." By contrast, 77 percent said the government spent "too little"
on education, 71 percent said it spent "too little" on assistance to the
poor, and 70 percent said it spent "too little" on improving and
protecting the nation's health. In February 2019, shortly after Trump
indicated he would seek another hefty spending increase in the U.S.
military budget, bringing it to an unprecedented \$750 billion, only 25
percent of American respondents to a Gallup poll stated that the U.S.
government was spending too little on the military. Another 73 percent
said that the government was spending too much on it or about the right
amount. Moreover, when it comes to using U.S. military might, Americans
seem considerably less hawkish than the Trump administration. According
to a July 2018 survey by the Eurasia Group Foundation, U.S. respondents
― asked what should be done if "Iran gets back on track with its nuclear
weapons program" ― favored diplomatic responses over military responses
by 80 percent to 12.5 percent. That same month, as the Chicago Council
noted, almost three times as many Americans believed that admiration for
the United States (73 percent) was more important than fear of their
country (26 percent) for achieving U.S. foreign policy goals. Unlike the
president, who has boasted of U.S. weapons sales to other countries,
particularly to Saudi Arabia, **[Americans are also rather uncomfortable
about the U.S. role as the world's pre-eminent arms
dealer]{.underline}**. In November 2018, [58 percent of Americans
surveyed told YouGov that they wanted the U.S. government to curtail or
halt its arms sales to the Saudi Arabian government, while only 13
percent wanted to maintain or increase such sales.]{.underline} Finally,
an overwhelming majority of Americans continues to express its support
for nuclear arms control and disarmament. In the aftermath of Trump's
withdrawal of the United States from the INF treaty and announcement of
plans to build new nuclear weapons, 87 percent of respondents to a
February 2019 poll by Chicago Council said they wanted the United States
and Russia to come to an agreement to limit nuclear arms. The real
question isn't whether [most Americans disagree with Trump's "America
First" national security policy]{.underline} --- they do, [in large
numbers]{.underline}. The real question is what they're willing to do
about it.

#### American nationalism isn't popular -- ending arms sales abroad is broadly bipartisan

**Carden, 2018** (James, executive editor for the American Committee for
East-West Accord and former adviser on Russia policy at the US State
Department, "A New Poll Shows the Public Is Overwhelmingly Opposed to
Endless US Military Interventions," The Nation, January 9,
https://www.thenation.com/article/new-poll-shows-public-overwhelmingly-opposed-to-endless-us-military-interventions/)

Nevertheless, [the new survey indicates that the desire for a sensible
American policy abroad goes well beyond Trump's base]{.underline}, and
that **[there is a wide bipartisan majority that seeks an American
foreign policy of realism and restraint.]{.underline}** [The
researchers]{.underline} at J. Wallin [note]{.underline}
[that]{.underline}, [even in spite of what they call a "climate of
distinct political polarization," the results show these sentiments vary
"only in degrees of intensity]{.underline} across political party,
ideology, age groups, gender, and geographic regions." The survey found
that **[78 percent of Democrats, 64.5 percent of Republicans, and 68.8
percent of independents supported restraining military action
overseas]{.underline}**. "Rarely," noted the report, "does opinion
research reveal issues that enjoy shared sentiments on a bi-partisan
level." [The poll brings home just how divorced the
Beltway]{.underline}---and its think tanks, media outlets, and political
class---[is from the expressed desire of a large majority of
Americans]{.underline} for a responsible and reasonable foreign policy,
a policy that, arguably, has been absent since the end of the Cold War.
**[Candidates from both parties running in this year's midterm election
ignore the results of the new survey at their peril.]{.underline}**

### Saudi Arabia

#### Backlash to Saudi arms sales is driving democratic campaigns

**Harris, 2018** (Bryant, Al-Monitor staff writer, "Intel: How
Democratic 2020 hopefuls are making the most of anti-Saudi backlash,"
Al-Monitor,
https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/11/intel-saudi-arabia-problems-boost-democratic-president.html)

Fresh off the midterm elections, [Democratic politicians hoping to
challenge]{.underline} President Donald [Trump in 2020 are starting to
hone their foreign policy credentials]{.underline}. And [Saudi Arabia
makes for ideal target practice]{.underline}. In a foreign policy
address today, Massachusetts senator and potential 2020 contender
Elizabeth [Warren criticized Trump for his close-knit relationship with
the Saudis]{.underline} despite the growing backlash against Riyadh in
the wake of Jamal Khashoggi's murder. "[The president of the United
States has refused to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia]{.underline} in
part [because]{.underline} [he is more interested in appeasing US
defense contractors than holding the Saudis accountable]{.underline} for
the murder of a Washington Post journalist or for the thousands of
Yemeni civilians killed by those weapons," Warren said in a speech at
American University. Why it matters: Warren's speech comes after another
high-profile 2020 hopeful, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., delivered his own
foreign policy address last month. [Sanders was equally critical of
Trump's relationship with the Saudis]{.underline}, repeatedly zeroing in
on Khashoggi's murder as an example of Trump's proclivity for foreign
dictators. Fast-forward to Wednesday, the Senate voted 63-37 to move
ahead with Sanders' resolution to force Trump to end US support for the
Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. That same day, the Trump administration
confirmed that Riyadh had inked a \$15 billion deal with defense
contractor Lockheed Martin for a missile defense system earlier in the
week. Drain the swamp: [The bipartisan backlash against Riyadh has made
it easy]{.underline} [for]{.underline} left-wing [Democrats to use Saudi
Arabia as a stand-in for their campaign against defense
contractors]{.underline} [and lobbyists]{.underline} working for foreign
dictators --- longtime fixtures in Washington's foreign policy
establishment. Warren, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
used Trump's determination to preserve Saudi arms sales as an example of
the "stranglehold of defense contractors on our military policy." The
Massachusetts Democrat also sent letters to 23 current and former Saudi
lobbyists asking them to detail their dealings with the Trump
administration. Earlier this year, she introduced legislation that would
ban lobbyists from receiving compensation from foreign governments, but
it's unlikely to pass in a Republican-held Senate. What's next? It
remains to be seen how Warren and Sanders, two prominent left-wing
senators, will differentiate themselves on Middle East policy if they
seek to secure the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. In the
meantime, [the endless stream of anti-Saudi outrage on Capitol Hill will
allow other potential challengers to assail Trump for his unapologetic
defense of the increasingly scrutinized relationship.]{.underline}

#### Saudi arms sales are massively unpopular

**Shesgreen, 2019** (Deirdre, foreign affairs and State Department
reporter for USA Today, "Trump administration plans to sell new weapons
to Saudis despite lawmakers\' objections," USA Today, May 24,
https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/05/24/trump-may-sell-saudis-new-weapons-despite-congress-objections/3768851002/)

WASHINGTON -- [The Trump administration will push through \$8.1 billion
in new weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and its allies]{.underline},
arguing that \"Iranian aggression\" presents a national security
emergency which gives the president authority to bypass congressional
objections. \"These sales will support our allies, enhance Middle East
stability, and help these nations to deter and defend themselves from
the Islamic Republic of Iran,\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said
Friday evening in announcing the decision. [The move prompted fierce
criticism from Democrats]{.underline} and at least one high-ranking
Republican. \"The Trump Administration decided to do an end run around
the Congress and possibly the law," Sen. Bob Menendez, the ranking
Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement
Friday. \"The possible consequences of this will ultimately jeopardize
the ability of the U.S. defense industry to export arms in a manner both
expeditious and responsible,\" the New Jersey Democrat added. Rep.
Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, said he agreed that Iran poses a threat to the U.S. and its
allies in the Middle East. But he sharply disagreed with the
administration\'s decision. \"The president's decision to use an
emergency waiver on these sales is unfortunate and will damage certain
future congressional interactions,\" McCaul said. The GOP chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jim Risch of Idaho, reacted more
cautiously. A staunch ally of President Donald Trump, Risch said he was
\"reviewing and analyzing the legal justification for this action and
the associated implications." Pompeo further inflamed the debate Friday
with a tweet suggesting that Congress had blocked the sales for more
than a year -- an assertion that sparked a viral outcry. \"We presented
some of these sales almost 18 months ago to Congress, but it has failed
to act,\" Pompeo tweeted. Menendez has previously vowed to block any
weapons sales to Saudi Arabia. But opposition to the arms transfers was
bipartisan, as lawmakers expressed growing concerns about the Saudi
regime\'s conduct in the Yemen war and other matters. The day after
Pompeo announced the new arms sales, the United Nations reported that 12
civilians had been killed, including seven children, in an airstrike by
the Saudi-led coalition. Overall, the war has killed thousands of Yemeni
civilians and caused the world\'s worst humanitarian crisis. Weapons
sales generally require a congressional sign-off. But the Trump
administration is relying on a narrow provision in the 1976 Arms Control
Act that allows the president to sidestep Congress in an emergency.
Under that measure, the president must certify that an emergency exists
\"which requires the proposed sale in the national security interest,\"
thus waiving Congress\' power to review and stop the sale. [U.S. weapons
sales to Saudi Arabia became particularly controversial in the wake of
the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist]{.underline}
and Virginia resident who was killed last fall by a team of Saudi
operatives. Lawmakers believe that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman, the country\'s de facto ruler, was complicit in Khashoggi\'s
murder. After Khashoggi vanished, Trump said the incident should not
jeopardize potential U.S. weapons deals with the kingdom. \"It could
very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event --
maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\" Trump said in a Nov. 20 statement
aimed at ending the debate over how he should respond to Khashoggi\'s
murder. "We're not going to give up hundreds of billions of dollars,"
Trump said then. Experts say Trump has exaggerated the financial
benefits of arms sales deals to the kingdom. And lawmakers in both
parties have pushed to cancel or suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia as a
signal to the regime that it does not have carte blanche to murder
journalists outside its borders, particularly those who are U.S.
residents. The State Department said Friday\'s decision would pave the
way for 22 pending arms transfers to Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates
and Jordan. Pompeo argued that delaying the weapons shipment could cause
\"degraded systems\" and leave those U.S. allies more vulnerable at a
time of heightened tensions in the region. Pompeo and other Trump
administration officials say the U.S. has gathered \"credible\"
intelligence suggesting a possible attack on U.S. forces by Iran. The
Pentagon has made a series of military deployments to the region,
including an additional 1,500 troops announced Friday, that Acting
Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan says are intended to deter Iran. The
new weapons sales are another indication of the Trump administration\'s
increasingly confrontational approach to Iran -- and a willingness to
side-step Congress on foreign policy decisions. Sen. Chris Murphy,
D-Conn., said Friday\'s announcement, if left unchecked, would set a
\"dangerous precedent,\" and he feared any weapons sold to the Saudis
and the UAE would end up killing civilians in the Yemen war, where the
two Middle Eastern countries have waged a devastating bombing campaign
against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. \"President Trump is only
using this loophole because he knows Congress would disapprove of this
sale,\" Murphy said. \"There is no new 'emergency' reason to sell bombs
to the Saudis to drop in Yemen, and doing so only perpetuates the
humanitarian crisis there.\" Pompeo said it would be a \"one-time
event\" and he intended to consult Congress on future weapons
transactions. The State Department did not specify what weapons or how
much each country would purchase. But lawmakers were told the sales
involved precision-guided missiles, bombs, ammunition and aircraft
maintenance support, according to Senate staffer who was not authorized
to speak about the matter on the record. Chris Murphy ✔ \@ChrisMurphyCT
· May 22, 2019 Replying to \@ChrisMurphyCT 4/ Maybe Trump will say that

President to claim any number of Middle East crises as an \"emergency\"
and then Congress will never ever be able to object to an arms sale
again. Chris Murphy ✔ \@ChrisMurphyCT 5/ If he does this, it\'s because

half the respondents stating an opinion (56%) also agreed that the US'

Majority unaware of US involvement in the Saudi and Emirati war effort
58% of respondents stated they did not know about the US government sold
weapons and provides military and intelligence support to the Coalition,
and 64% of respondents reported they did not know that the Saudi and
Emirati-led coalition was striking civilian targets, including a school
bus containing 40 children in August. Said David Miliband, President and
CEO of the IRC: "[Americans of all political stripes]{.underline} reject
the US policy of fueling the war in Yemen. They [agree that by
continuing to provide military and diplomatic support for one side of
the conflict, the US is fueling a crisis that has severe consequences
for millions]{.underline} of civilians. 14 million people are on the
brink of starvation. Yemenis deserve an end to this morally and
strategically bankrupt war. The IRC's 800 staff working in the North and
South of the country are all too familiar with their unimaginable
suffering. The people of Yemen urgently need an end to the fighting -
for humanitarian aid to flow, for the economy to revitalize, and for the
political process to take hold. US calls for a ceasefire a near month
ago can only hold with the backing of the UN, and an end to the US' own
military support to the Coalition. Otherwise, peace will not only be
unrealistic but impossible. As soon as tomorrow the Senate could begin
debate on War Powers resolution to bar further US involvement. It is all
the more critical that the the opposition of Americans be heard. The US
has the political and military leverage to help end this war. The
question is whether the Congress and the Administration will listen to
the American public and use it, bringing an end to its role in the
world's worst humanitarian crisis." NOTE TO EDITORS \*This survey was

### Israel

#### The trump stance on Israel is unpopular- the public supports reducing militarization

**Beilin, 2018** (Yossi, served in various positions in the Knesset and
in Israeli government posts, the last of which was justice and religious
affairs minister; "[US]{.underline}, Israeli, Palestinian [leaders more
hawkish than their peoples]{.underline}," Al-Monitor, December 9,
https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/12/israel-palestine-gaza-west-bank-east-jerusalem-peace-survey.html)

A survey conducted a few weeks ago by the Palestinian Center for Public
Opinion at Beit Sahour, among Palestinians from the West Bank, East
Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, which has been since quoted in a
publication of the Washington Institute, shows that the positions of the
Palestinian public are significantly more moderate than those of its
leaders; this is the case in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, the
Fatah-led West Bank and East Jerusalem. The survey focused on three main
topics: the attitude of those surveyed to the realization of the right
of return of 1948 Palestinian refugees to sovereign Israel, their
attitude about the definition of Israel as a Jewish state and their
position on the Israeli demand that an agreement between the sides be
officially determined to be "the end of the conflict." On most of these
topics the position of the East Jerusalemites proved most dovish;
generally in the middle were residents of the Gaza Strip, while
residents of the West Bank were generally more hawkish than their
brethren. But on all questions, it turned out, the Palestinian public is
far from insisting on the positions of its leaders, and would back an
American plan that would force the two sides to make significant
concessions on what have been previously presented as the Palestinians\'
red lines. According to the poll, two-thirds of Gaza residents would
accept realization of the right of return only to the West Bank and
Gaza, and not to sovereign Israel. Meanwhile, 60% of those surveyed in
East Jerusalem are prepared to define Israel as a Jewish state under a
peace agreement (compared with 55% in Gaza and 35% in the West Bank). As
for determining the "end of the conflict," 73% of those surveyed in East
Jerusalem support it, compared with 50% in the West Bank (where 37%
oppose it) and 47% backing it in the Gaza Strip (where 49% oppose it).
[Surveys conducted in recent years in the United States show that the
majority of those surveyed accept]{.underline} President Bill
[Clinton's]{.underline} 2000 [parameters for the end of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict]{.underline} (two states on the basis of
the 1967 border with amendments, a symbolic solution for refugees, the
evacuation of settlements east of the new border between the states and
the division of East Jerusalem between Jewish and Arab neighborhoods and
designation of the Palestinian capital there. In Israel this has been
the situation for many years: The majority opinion has been for a
two-state solution by means of the annexation of settlement blocs,
territorial compensation for this annexation and concession of the Arab
neighborhoods in East Jerusalem. But the stance of the Palestinian
leadership has been more extreme than that of the Palestinian public,
the stance of the current Israeli leadership is more extreme than that
of the Israeli public and **[the stance of the Trump administration is
very far from the position of the public in the United
States]{.underline}**.

### Taiwan

#### Hardline stances on china are unpopular

**Chicago Council on Global Affairs, 2018** (independent, nonpartisan

Less Threatened than White House by China," Chicago Council Survey,

https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/press-release/poll-american-public-less-threatened-white-house-china)

[The Trump administration has recently escalated its rhetoric against
China]{.underline} with major speeches by both the president and vice
president strongly condemning China's actions including intellectual
property theft, interfering in the US midterm elections, and expanding
into the South China Sea. Though the Trump administration has taken a
hard line on China, labeling it a "malign influence" -- **[Americans do
not see China as a critical threat]{.underline}**, [according to new
public opinion data]{.underline} [released today from the 2018 Chicago
Council Survey]{.underline}. [The report]{.underline}, **["Americans Not
Yet Following White House Lead on China]{.underline}**," [finds that
four in 10 Americans]{.underline} (39 percent), consistent across party
affiliations, [say]{.underline} the development of [China]{.underline}
as a world power [is a critical threat]{.underline} facing the United
States, placing it eighth out of 12 potential threats included in the
survey. Though the possibility of a trade war with China is also not
seen as a critical threat, **[a majority]{.underline}** (72 percent)
**[of Americans are concerned a trade war will hurt their local
economies]{.underline}**. Findings from the report include: Seven in ten
Americans (72 percent) are either very concerned (31 percent) or
somewhat concerned (41 percent) that a trade war with China would hurt
their local economy. [Minorities of Americans support the use of US
troops in conflicts involving China]{.underline}, either in the case of
a conflict with Japan over disputed islands (41 percent) or if China
invaded Taiwan (35 percent). Two-thirds of Americans prefer to
strengthen ties with traditional allies Japan and South Korea (66
percent) over developing a new partnership with China (26 percent). [A
plurality of Americans]{.underline} (43 percent) [say China is more
respected in the world than it was a decade ago]{.underline}, and on a
0-10 scale, they give China an average influence rating of 7.3, making
it the second most influential country in the world. Methodology The
analysis in this report is based on data from the 2018 Chicago Council
Survey of the American public on foreign policy. The 2018 Chicago
Council Survey was conducted by GfK Custom Research using their
large-scale, nationwide online research panel between July 12 and July
31, 2018 among a representative national sample of 2,046 adults, 18
years of age or older, living in all 50 US states and the District of
Columbia. The margin of sampling error for the full sample is ±2.37,
including a design effect of 1.1954. The margin of error is higher for
partisan subgroups or for partial-sample items. The 2018 Chicago Council
Survey is a project of the Lester Crown Center on US Foreign Policy, and
is made possible by the generous support of the John D. and Catherine T.
MacArthur Foundation, the Korea Foundation, the US-Japan Foundation, the

## Internal Links

### Plan key for Trump

#### Softening his hardline stance on military involvement overseas is the necessary internal link to a trump victory

**Kriner and Shen, 2017** (Douglas, Professor of political science at
Boston University, and Francis, Associate Professor of Law at the
University of Minnesota, "Battlefield Casualties and Ballot Box Defeat:
Did the Bush-Obama Wars Cost Clinton the White House?" Social Science
Research Network,
https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2989040)

With so much post-election analysis, it is surprising that no one has
pointed to the possibility that inequalities in wartime sacrifice might
have tipped the election. Put simply: [perhaps the small slice of
America that is fighting and dying for the nation's security is tired of
its political leaders ignoring this disproportionate
burden]{.underline}.6 To investigate this possibility, we conducted an
analysis of the 2016 Presidential election returns. In previous
research, we've shown that communities with higher casualty rates are
also communities from more rural, less wealthy, and less educated parts
of the country.7 In both 2004 and 2006, voters in these communities
became more likely to vote against politicians perceived as
orchestrating the conflicts in which their friends and neighbors died.8
[The data analysis]{.underline} presented in this working paper [finds
that in the 2016 election Trump spoke to this part of
America]{.underline}. [Even controlling in a statistical model for many
other alternative explanations, we find that there is a significant and
meaningful relationship between a community's rate of military sacrifice
and its support for Trump]{.underline}. Indeed[, our results suggest
that if]{.underline} three states key to Trump's
victory---[Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin---had suffered even a
modestly lower casualty rate, all three could have flipped]{.underline}
from red to blue and sent Hillary Clinton to the White House. There are
many implications of our findings. First, [the findings should signal to
the White House that **Trump's 2020 electoral fate may**]{.underline}
well **[rest on the administration's approach to the human costs of
war]{.underline}**. If Trump wants to maintain his connection to this
part of his base, his foreign policy would do well to be highly
sensitive to American combat casualties. Many politicians have exhibited
casualty sensitivity of course, but [if this segment of the electorate
is particularly important to Trump's fortunes in 2020, it may suggest a
more powerful democratic brake on foreign wars]{.underline}. Second, the
findings are also a lesson for the Democrats and establishment
Republicans who are still trying to figure out how to beat Trump. [Our
analysis suggests that politicians from both parties would do well to
more directly recognize and address the needs of those communities whose
young women and men are making the ultimate sacrifice for the
country]{.underline}. Third, the results also raise puzzling questions
about the relationship between some of Trump's rhetoric (for instance
his highly-publicized argument with a Gold Star family) and his
perception amongst communities with higher casualty rates. Further
research is required to explore these and other implications.

### Foreign Policy Key

#### Strong anti-militarism stance wins trump the election -- it's a crucial issue

**Carden, 2018** (James, executive editor for the American Committee for
East-West Accord and former adviser on Russia policy at the US State
Department, "A New Poll Shows the Public Is Overwhelmingly Opposed to
Endless US Military Interventions," The Nation, January 9,
https://www.thenation.com/article/new-poll-shows-public-overwhelmingly-opposed-to-endless-us-military-interventions/)

[The poll shows]{.underline} strong, indeed [overwhelming, support, for
Congress to reassert itself in the oversight of US military
interventions,]{.underline} with 70.8 percent of those polled saying
Congress should pass legislation that would restrain military action
overseas in three specific ways: by requiring "clearly defined goals to
authorize military engagement" (78.8 percent); by requiring Congress "to
have both oversight and accountability regarding where troops are
stationed" (77 percent); by requiring that "any donation of funds or
equipment to a foreign country be matched by a pledge of that country to
adhere to the rules of the Geneva Convention" (84.8 percent). [The
results]{.underline} of the J. Wallin Opinion Research survey would
[seem to track with the results of another study]{.underline} undertaken
last year by Francis Shen, a law professor at the University of
Minnesota Law School, and Dougas Kriner, a political science professor
at Boston University, **[who found that Hillary Clinton's loss in the
2016 presidential race might well have been owing to her hawkish
foreign-policy positions]{.underline}**. [The study]{.underline},
"Battlefield Casualties and Ballot Box Defeat: Did the Bush-Obama Wars
Cost Clinton the White House?," [which was released last summer, found
that "a divide is emerging between communities whose young people are
dying to defend the country]{.underline}, [and those communities whose
young people are not."]{.underline} That divide, which the authors
termed "**[the casualty gap]{.underline}**," **[may have contributed to
Donald Trump's surprise victory]{.underline}**. Indeed, "even
controlling in a statistical model for many other alternative
explanations," the authors found [there was "a significant and
meaningful relationship between a community's rate of military sacrifice
and its support for Trump]{.underline}."

### A2 Econ O/W

#### Generic economic data doesn't show the real picture -- voters aren't happy about the economy

**Reich, 2019** (Robert, American political commentator and chancellor's
professor of public policy at UC-Berkeley, served in the admins of
President's Ford, Carter, and Clinton; "ROBERT REICH: TRUMP\'S GOOD
ECONOMY IS ONLY GOOD FOR THE LIKES OF DONALD TRUMP \| OPINION," May
20^th^,
https://www.newsweek.com/robert-reich-trump-economics-personal-economy-one-percent-1430184)

The award for this year\'s Biggest Backhanded Compliment to Trump from a
Trump Toadie goes to White House acting chief of staff Mick
[Mulvaney]{.underline}, who recently [predicted a Trump victory in 2020
because "people will vote for somebody they don\'t like if they think
it\'s good for them]{.underline}." Mulvaney knows most Americans don\'t
like Trump. But [Mulvaney thinks they\'ll forgive his unsavory traits
because unemployment has hit a fifty-year low, wages are rising, and
economic growth exceeds 3 percent]{.underline}. A CNN poll released in
early May shows 56 percent of Americans approve Trump\'s handling of the
economy. This is making some Democrats nervous. No president since World
War II has failed to be reelected when the economy was good. "What
Democrats have to be most worried about is the economy," says Democratic
pollster Celinda Lake. [But there\'s a whopping difference between
Americans thinking the economy is good in general, and thinking it\'s
good for them personally]{.underline}. [**The personal economy drives
votes, and most Americans think their personal economy is
lousy**.]{.underline} In a survey by The Washington Postand ABC News
published May 7, more than [80 percent of Democrats and 66 percent of
independents said "the economic system]{.underline} in this country"
mainly [works "to benefit those in power]{.underline}," rather than all
Americans. [Nearly a third of Republicans agreed]{.underline}. The
official economic statistics don\'t reflect personal economics---what
people tell each other over the kitchen table when they\'re trying to
pay the bills. Although more Americans are employed, [most jobs still
pay squat]{.underline}. [Adjusted for inflation, recent wage gains are
small]{.underline}er than wage gains in 2015. Workers have lost so much
bargaining power that not even the lowest unemployment rate in half a
century is doing much to boost wages. [Employers continue to sack
workers willy-nilly]{.underline}. Two years ago AT&T executives promised
that the pending corporate tax cut would allow them to create more jobs.
They laid off 23,000 instead. Consider that [almost 80 percent of
American workers are living paycheck to paycheck]{.underline} and you
get a feel for the havoc so many families are living in. Meanwhile, the
costs of education, childcare, housing, and health care are soaring, and
Trump hasn\'t done a thing to help. If anything, he\'s made it worse.
[Student loan debt is in the stratosphere]{.underline}. Remember the old
promise that if you took a public service job your student loan would be
forgiven? Betsy DeVos\'s Education Department has rejected 98 percent of
forgiveness applications. [Housing is out of reach for young
workers]{.underline}, which is why so many are living with their parents
and postponing marriage. [Childcare is becoming
unaffordable]{.underline}. The average cost of center-based child
carefor an infant is now \$1,230 a month; \$800 a month if you park him
or her in a family childcare home. [Health insurance is a
nightmare]{.underline}. Last year alone, 30.4 million Americans went
without any coverage \-- about 1.1 million more than the year before,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\'s National
Health Interview Survey. That\'s the second year the figure has risen
after years of declines due to the Affordable Care Act. The reversal is
largely because of Trump\'s efforts to undermine the Act. The Trump
administration is now asking a court to throw it out entirely.
[Co-payments and deductibles are out of control]{.underline}. According
to a recent Gallup survey, Americans borrowed \$88 billion to pay for
health care last year, and one out of four people decided not to see a
doctor because of cost. Trumpland has been especially hard hit. A
quarter of working-age adults in Texas lack health insurance, for
example (in Massachusetts, it\'s 4.9%.) Trump\'s trade wars have
hammered the kitchen tables of rural America. With corn and soybean
prices plummeting, farm incomes are down \$12 billion in the first
quarter of this year, according to the Department of Agriculture. Farm
bankruptcies are at near record levels. [Mulvany may be
correct]{.underline} that people will vote for somebody they dislike if
they think it\'s good for them. **[Yet Trump\'s economy isn\'t good for
most Americans]{.underline}**. If Democrats speak to the practical
economic needs of Americans and offer realistic solutions, as they\'ve
started to do, Americans won\'t pay attention to overall economic
statistics when they vote in 2020. They'll heed what's in their kitchen,
and Trump will be toast.

## Impacts

### Accidental War

#### Trump victory makes war inevitable -- lack of experience and belligerent foreign policy ensure accidental conflicts escalate

**Gordon**, 5/20/**2019** (Philip, Mary and David Boies senior fellow in
U.S. foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, "A Path to War
With Iran," Foreign Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iran/2019-05-20/path-war-iran)

ALL TOO PREDICTABLE [That the Trump administration's approach to Iran
could lead the United States into an inadvertent conflict should come as
a surprise to no one]{.underline}. Indeed, from the day Trump took
office, many feared that his impulsive behavior, blustering rhetoric,
inability to think ahead, disrespect for policy process, and
determination to "win" could lead to war. In a spring 2017 essay for
this magazine ("A Vision of Trump at War," May/June 2017), I raised
concerns about his potential to stumble into conflict with Iran, China,
or North Korea. I wrote the essay in the form of a fictional look back
at events that hadn't actually happened but could, if Trump tried to
bluff his way to "better deals" through confrontation and escalation,
and without realistically assessing what was achievable or how potential
adversaries might react. [Two years later, the good news is that none of
these wars have happened]{.underline}. [But the bad news is that Trump
continues to display the characteristics that made such developments
plausible]{.underline} in the first place. If anything, **[he appears
readier than ever to break with norms and antagonize allies and
adversaries alike]{.underline}**. Moreover, [the advisers who now
surround him are less willing and able than their
predecessors]{.underline} to constrain his most provocative
tendencies---[when they are not actually determined to encourage such
tendencies]{.underline} for their own purposes. **[Iran is by far the
most dangerous contingency]{.underline}** in the near term, [but it is
hardly the only place where Trump could stumble into accidental
war]{.underline}. [Trump seems to have painted himself into a corner
with China in much the same way as]{.underline} he has done with
[Iran]{.underline}: by imposing unilateral sanctions, misreading his
opponents, and misleading the American people about the costs, risks,
and consequences of his approach. The tariffs he initially imposed on
\$50 billion in imports from China were supposed to produce a "better
deal," but instead---and unsurprisingly---provoked Chinese
counter-tariffs. The United States responded by increasing the rate of
the tariffs and preparing to expand them to cover the entirety of
China's \$540 billion in exports to the United States. Even as the costs
to U.S. farmers, producers, and consumers mount, [Trump is now
speculating that he will be better off politically if he continues to
confront China at least until the 2020 elections.]{.underline} A trade
deal with China is, of course, still possible, just like a new nuclear
deal with Iran. But **[further escalation is]{.underline}** also **[a
real possibility]{.underline}**, [as is a dangerous spillover from the
economic domain to the political one.]{.underline} Indeed, in my
fictional scenario I imagined the slippery slope toward military
conflict having been preceded by a "trade war that escalated beyond what
either side had predicted," and an extreme nationalist China denying the
United States cooperation in North Korea and challenging it in the South
China Sea. China's state media is now calling the United States an
"all-out bully," a "paper tiger," and "colonialist." At least one
prominent Chinese scholar has suggested that Beijing hit the "anxious
and arrogant" United States by banning the rare earths on which U.S.
industry relies and selling U.S. treasury bonds, moves that would have a
devastating impact on the U.S. economy. Trump seems to have failed to
anticipate that other countries have domestic politics, too---not to
mention leverage to use against the United States. Trump's approach to
North Korea began with bluster, name-calling, and threats, yielding in
2018 to a surprising rapprochement; Trump even claimed that he and the
dictator Kim Jong Un "fell in love." This courting of Kim was a welcome
alternative to a possible nuclear war, but Trump could easily revert to
hostility, given his penchant for turning suddenly and brutally on
anyone whom he believes has turned on him. North Korea's recent testing
of a "new type of tactical-guided weapon," its resumption of short-range
missile tests, and the U.S. seizure of a North Korean smuggling ship
that Pyongyang is demanding be returned are all recent reminders that
relations could deteriorate quickly if Trump's professed love for Kim
proves unrequited. And [now we can add Venezuela to the list of
countries about which U.S. miscalculations could lead to deadly
conflict]{.underline}. Trump boldly threw in his lot with the Venezuelan
opposition and called for regime change, confident that U.S. pressure
could dislodge the corrupt regime of Nicolas Maduro. He seems to have
failed to anticipate that Maduro would use violence to cling to power,
and that he would do so with Russian, Chinese, and Cuban support. [Now
Trump finds himself caught between accepting an embarrassing failure or
escalating in a way that could involve U.S. military
intervention]{.underline}, an "option" he does not rule out. WHAT NEXT?
With all the public talk about the potential for conflict with Iran,
Trump appears to be looking for a way out. He said last week that he
would "like to see \[Iran's leaders\] call me," and he reportedly told
the Pentagon that he did not want to go to war. His continued outreach
to Chinese Leader Xi Jinping and Kim Jong Un, despite their defiance,
also suggests that he may well understand the risks of escalation.
Perhaps Trump has, after all, envisaged a future that includes
inadvertent U.S. military conflict and doesn't like what he sees. [Less
reassuring]{.underline}, however, [is that the Trump administration's
overall approach to these issues]{.underline}---and the president's
personal approach to dealmaking---[has not changed and risks ending in
catastrophic failure]{.underline}. [The pattern seems to be one of
hoping that threats]{.underline}, sanctions, and bluster [force an
adversary to concede]{.underline} or accept a "great deal"; [then,
having failed to anticipate the actual results]{.underline} of such
tactics, [the United States finds itself backed into a
corner]{.underline} with no obvious way out. In an apparent effort to
assuage fears of war with Iran, [one senior U.S. official
said]{.underline} to The Washington Post this week, "[because we are
applying levels of pressure that don't have any historic precedent, I
think we can expect Iran to increase its threats and to increase its
malign behavior]{.underline}." That such a response from Iran might be
explicable does not make it reassuring. [While Trump may not want
war]{.underline}, moreover, [he is no longer surrounded by advisers who
can help him avoid it]{.underline}. Former Defense Secretary James
Mattis, someone who had seen war up close, was a voice of restraint, but
he has now been gone for six months, and his acting successor has
neither the stature nor apparently the willingness to challenge Trump.
[The president's two closest foreign policy advisers are
now]{.underline} Secretary of State Mike [Pompeo]{.underline}---[an
uber-hawk on Iran]{.underline} who seems to tell Trump only what he
wants to hear---[and]{.underline} National Security Adviser John
[Bolton, who has long advocated]{.underline} the very sorts of
[wars]{.underline} Trump apparently seeks to avoid. Bolton has argued
that the only way to stop Iran's nuclear program is to bomb it and
advocated supporting Iranian ethnic and internal resistance groups in
order to accelerate regime change. He has also called on the United
States to revisit the "one China" policy and "see how an increasingly
belligerent China responds"; refused to rule out the use of U.S. forces
in Venezuela while insisting that the Monroe Doctrine is "alive and
well"; and written that "it is perfectly legitimate for the United
States to respond to the current 'necessity' posed by North Korea's
nuclear weapons by striking first."

### Economy

#### Trump second term results in economic destabilization and diversionary conflict

**Porter, 2018** (Patrick, Chair in International Security and Strategy

STRATEGY IN TRUMP'S SECOND TERM," War on the Rocks, August 6,
https://warontherocks.com/2018/08/crisis-and-conviction-u-s-grand-strategy-in-trumps-second-term/)

[We would be wise to entertain the possibility of a second term of
Trump]{.underline}. Thus far, it has proven futile for Trump's critics
to seek refuge in wishful expectations that he would go away, a wish
found wanting every time it is updated. Recall that critics have hoped
Trump wouldn't win the nomination; that he would lose the election; that
he would be impeached; that he will not stand again for office. The hope
for a post-Trump return to political normality is similarly vain. After
Trump there will likely be more Trumps, given the force of populist
revolt that he has stirred, and the general dissatisfaction with the
alleged liberal world order, whose breakdown and failures made Trumpism
possible in the first place. There are good reasons to expect Trump to
be a strong contender for re-election. Since World War II, [incumbency
has been a strong force in U.S. presidential politics]{.underline}. It
has been rare for one of the two major parties to hold the presidency
for only one term. Consider too Trump's standing. His disapproval
ratings are at historic highs, yet he also strongly mobilizes his base.
Donations to Trump's re-election campaign flood in. Trump enjoys near
record approval from Republican voters, with no sign of mass defections.
As things stand, he can campaign for a second term with a contentious
but powerful story: a booming economy, low unemployment, a rising stock
market, strictly enforced borders and tariff walls, and making peace
through tough confrontation of North Korea and Iran. Each of these
claims can be unpicked. But rebutting them takes explanation. In
politics, if you're explaining, you're failing. Trump may be fortunate
that his re-election timetable coincides with the right side of an
economic "boom bust" cycle. [Were he to win a second term, and
especially if the margin was more decisive]{.underline}, the conditions
of his presidency would change. If he won big, [he would have more
political capital to spend.]{.underline} He would feel vindicated [by
the authority of a second mandate]{.underline}. Term limits would mean
that he would no longer need fear election failure. [It is possible that
**Trump "Mark 2" would be more willing to tolerate the costs of
introducing major change in American grand strategy**]{.underline}.
Consider further the possibility of [a major strategic
shock]{.underline}, with an impact comparable to the Wall Street Crash
of 1929, the Japanese assault on Pearl Harbor in 1941, or the OPEC oil
embargo of 1973. By definition, the shape and outline of the shock is
unclear. And we can't know when it would happen. But if the literature
on great power decline is sound, it [would likely have military and
economic dimensions, featuring some fatal interaction of war and
debt]{.underline}. The source of the next financial crisis could lie
elsewhere, but [Trump's own policies also make more likely]{.underline}
what was an implicit tendency, increasing the debt-deficit load and
[repeating a familiar pattern]{.underline}, [whereby]{.underline} a
large deficit-financed military build-up, [deficit-financed
wars]{.underline} (alongside tax cuts) stimulates demand,
[create]{.underline}s [bubbles]{.underline} of irrational exuberance,
[overheats the economy]{.underline}, and eventually leads to a loss of
confidence in markets. This would be [followed by a
contraction]{.underline}, **[but this time without the financial
reserves that were available to mitigate the last financial
crisis]{.underline}**. [This process could erupt sooner rather than
later]{.underline}. It would take [the]{.underline} combination of a
[strategic shock]{.underline} great enough to discredit the status quo
[and]{.underline} [a determined revisionist president]{.underline}. If
so, then these forces [might come together, to take the president off
the chain]{.underline}, and to create a domestic environment more
hospitable to major change. Earlier security shocks, such as the 2008
financial crisis, did not lead in this direction because the Bush
administration was averse to retrenching commitments. [With
Trump]{.underline} or a Trumpian figure in the white house, [one
response]{.underline} that was once taboo [would be on the table**: a
fundamental retrenchment of overseas commitments**]{.underline}, along
the lines of Trump's instincts. It isn't certain what this will involve,
but it would be drastic and imply a different assumption about how to
pursue security. [It could lead the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [to]{.underline}, for example, withdraw from the
Gulf and [let Saudi Arabia acquire the bomb]{.underline},
[or]{.underline} to acknowledge Russia's view of its sphere of influence
while [withdraw]{.underline}ing [from NATO]{.underline} or decisively
repudiating Article 5, [or to reduce military expenditure]{.underline}
just to the level needed for the United States to deter attacks and
defend itself. [American "greatness" would]{.underline} still be Trump's
signature tune, but it would [be redefined]{.underline} around
liberating America from foreign entanglements, investing in and walling
off the country, and an industrial renaissance. To be sure, [the
American foreign policy class]{.underline} [would fight
back]{.underline} furiously. [But]{.underline} like in the era of
Vietnam and the oil embargo, [its power and confidence would be
diminished]{.underline}. Already [scarred]{.underline} [by the
last]{.underline} global financial [crisis, stagnating wages and general
alienation]{.underline}, [the populace would be more
receptive]{.underline}. An emboldened and more risk-prone president
would be willing to hire outsiders as officials, less experienced and
capable but ideologically attuned to the narrower security vision of
"America First." All this might be difficult to imagine. But [rapid
realignments of grand strategy can happen]{.underline}. As I argued,
[one example is Great Britain's postwar abandonment of
empire]{.underline}. New conditions were inhospitable to the exhausted
country maintaining its colonies. These included the cumulative fiscal
pressures of World War II, decolonization resistance, the United States'
dismantling of the economic order of imperial preference and the
sterling bloc; and the shock of the Suez crisis of 1956, which revealed
Britain's vulnerability to U.S. coercion. Successive British governments
were impelled to bow to these pressures once they became overwhelming.
They then redefined Britain's status around alliances and nuclear
weapons, presenting retreat from empire as a graceful management of
change and casting the emergence of independent countries as "the
crowning achievement of British rule." [If we see a different kind of
President Trump unleashed by new conditions, less constrained and more
emboldened]{.underline}, in a context where major retrenchment becomes
thinkable and attractive, only then will he or his heirs probably try to
bring down the priesthood's temple. If so, as Steve Bannon suggested,
**[the next episode of Trump's prime-time show will be as "wild as
shit]{.underline}**."

### Proliferation

#### Trump second term guarantees runaway arms races and allied proliferation

**Starr, 2019** (Paul, professor of sociology and public affairs at
Princeton and a winner of the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction,
"Trump's Second Term," The Atlantic, May,
https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/05/trump-2020-second-term/585994/)

[The 2020 election will also determine]{.underline} whether the U.S.
continues on a course that all but guarantees [another kind of runaway
global change]{.underline}---**[a stepped-up arms race, and with it a
heightened risk of nuclear accidents and nuclear war]{.underline}**.
[Trump's "America first" doctrine]{.underline}, attacks on America's
alliances, [and unilateral withdrawal from arms-control
treaties]{.underline} [have made the world far more
dangerous]{.underline}. After pulling the United States out of the Iran
nuclear agreement (in so doing, badly damaging America's reputation as
both an ally and a negotiating partner), [Trump failed]{.underline} to
secure from North Korea anything approaching the Iran deal's terms,
[leaving Kim Jong Un]{.underline} not only [unchecked]{.underline} but
[with increased international standing.]{.underline} Many world leaders
are hoping that Trump's presidency is a blip---that he will lose in
2020, and that his successor will renew America's commitments to its
allies and to the principles of multilateralism and nonproliferation.
**[If he is reelected]{.underline}**, however, **[several countries may
opt to pursue nuclear weapons]{.underline}**, [especially those in
regions that have relied on American security guarantees]{.underline},
[such as the Middle East and Northeast Asia]{.underline}. **[At stake is
the global nonproliferation regime]{.underline}** that the United States
and other countries have maintained over the past several decades to
persuade nonnuclear powers to stay that way. [That this regime has
largely succeeded is a tribute to a combination of tactics]{.underline},
[including U.S. bilateral and alliance-based defense
commitments]{.underline} to nonnuclear countries, punishments and
incentives, [and pledges]{.underline} by the U.S. and Russia---as the
world's leading nuclear powers---[to make dramatic cuts to their own
arsenals.]{.underline} [In his first term, Trump has begun to undermine
the nonproliferation regime and dismantle the remaining arms-control
treaties]{.underline} between Washington and Moscow. In October, he
announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty signed in 1987 by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail
Gorbachev. [While the Russian violations]{.underline} of the treaty that
[Trump cited are inexcusable, he has made no effort to hold Russia to
its obligations]{.underline}---to the contrary, by destroying the
treaty, he has let Russia off the hook. What's more, he has displayed no
interest in extending New START, which since 2011 has limited the
strategic nuclear arsenals of Russia and the United States. If the
treaty is allowed to expire, 2021 will mark the first year since 1972
without a legally binding agreement in place to control and reduce the
deadliest arsenals ever created. **[The prospect of a new nuclear arms
race is suddenly very real]{.underline}**. [With the end of verifiable
limits]{.underline} on American and Russian nuclear weapons, [both
countries]{.underline} will lose the right to inspect each other's
arsenal, and [will face greater uncertainty about each other's
capabilities and intentions]{.underline}. [Already, rhetoric has taken
an ominous turn]{.underline}: [After Trump suspended U.S. participation
in the INF]{.underline} Treaty on February 2, Vladimir [Putin quickly
followed suit and promised a "symmetrical response" to new American
weapons]{.underline}. Trump replied a few days later in his State of the
Union address, threatening to "outspend and out-innovate all others by
far" in weapons development. The treaties signed by the United States
and Russia beginning in the 1980s have resulted in the elimination of
nearly 90 percent of their nuclear weapons; the end of the Cold War
seemed to confirm that those weapons had limited military utility.
Now---as the U.S. and Russia abandon their commitment to arms control,
and Trump's "America first" approach causes countries such as Japan and
Saudi Arabia to question the durability of U.S. security
guarantees---[the stage is being set for more states to go nuclear and
for the U.S. and Russia to ramp up weapons development]{.underline}.
This breathtaking historical reversal would, like global warming, likely
feed on itself, becoming more and more difficult to undo.

#### Prolif causes extinction

Matthew **Kroenig 14**, Ph.D., Associate Professor and International
Relations Field Chair, Department of Government, Georgetown, February
2014, "The History of Proliferation Optimism: Does It Have a Future?"
Journal of Strategic Studies Vol 38, Issue 1-2

First and foremost, [proliferation **optimists present an oversimplified
view of nuclear deterrence theory**]{.underline}. [Optimists
argue]{.underline} that since the advent of Mutually Assured Destruction
(MAD), any [nuclear war would mean national suicide and, therefore, no
rational leader would ever choose to start one.]{.underline}
Furthermore, they argue that the requirements for rationality are not
high. Rather, leaders must value their own survival and the survival of
their nation and understand that intentionally launching a nuclear war
would threaten those values. Many analysts and policymakers attempt to
challenge the optimists on their own turf and question whether the
leaders of potential proliferant states are fully rational.34 Yet, these
debates overlook the fact that, apart from the optimists, leadi[ng
nuclear deterrence theorists believe that nuclear proliferation
contributes to a **real risk of nuclear war even in a situation of MAD
among rational states**]{.underline}.35 Moreover, realizing that nuclear
war is possible does not depend on peculiar beliefs about the
possibility of escaping MAD.36 Rather, as we will discuss below, these
theorists understand that [some risk of nuclear war is **necessary in
order for deterrence to function**]{.underline}. To be sure, in the
1940s, Viner, Brodie, and others argued that MAD rendered war among
major powers obsolete, but nuclear deterrence theory soon advanced
beyond that simple understanding.37 After all, [great power political
competition does not end with nuclear weapons]{.underline}. And
[nuclear-armed states still seek to threaten nuclear-armed
adversaries]{.underline}. [States cannot credibly threaten to launch a
suicidal nuclear war, but they still want to coerce their adversaries.
This leads to a credibility problem: how can states credibly threaten a
nuclear-armed opponent?]{.underline} Since the 1960s, academic nuclear
deterrence theory has been devoted almost exclusively to answering this
question.38 And their answers do not give us reasons to be optimistic.
Thomas [Schelling was the first to devise a rational means by which
states can threaten nuclear-armed opponents]{.underline}.39 He argued
that [leaders cannot credibly threaten to intentionally launch a
suicidal nuclear war, but they can make a 'threat that leaves something
to chance'.]{.underline} 40 They can engage in a process, the nuclear
crisis, which increases the risk of nuclear war in an attempt to force a
less resolved adversary to back down. [As states escalate a nuclear
crisis there is an **increasing probability that the conflict will
spiral out of control and result in an inadvertent or accidental nuclear
exchange**]{.underline}. [As long as the benefit of winning the crisis
is greater than the incremental increase in the risk of nuclear war,
however, threats to escalate nuclear crises are inherently
credible]{.underline}. In these games of nuclear brinkmanship, [the
state that is willing to run the greatest risk of nuclear war before
backing down will win the crisis]{.underline}, as long as it does not
end in catastrophe. It is for this reason that Thomas [Schelling called
great power politics in the nuclear era a '**competition in risk
taking'**.]{.underline} 41 This does not mean that states eagerly bid up
the risk of nuclear war. Rather, they face gut-wrenching decisions at
each stage of the crisis. They can quit the crisis to avoid nuclear war,
but only by ceding an important geopolitical issue to an opponent. Or
they can the escalate the crisis in an attempt to prevail, but only at
the risk of suffering a possible nuclear exchange. Since 1945 there were
have been 20 high stakes nuclear crises in which 'rational' states like
the United States run a frighteningly-real risk of nuclear war.42 [By
asking whether states can be deterred, therefore, proliferation
optimists are **asking the wrong question**]{.underline}. [The right
question to ask is: what risk of nuclear war is a specific state willing
to run against a particular opponent in a given crisis?]{.underline}
Optimists are likely correct when they assert that a nuclear-armed Iran
will not intentionally commit national suicide by launching a
bolt-from-the-blue nuclear attack on the United States or Israel. This
does not mean that Iran will never use nuclear weapons, however. Indeed,
it is almost inconceivable to think that a nuclear-armed Iran would not,
at some point, find itself in a crisis with another nuclear-armed power.
It is also inconceivable that in those circumstances, Iran would not be
willing to run some risk of nuclear war in order to achieve its
objectives. If a nuclear-armed Iran and the United States or Israel were
to have a geopolitical conflict in the future, over the internal
politics of Syria, an Israeli conflict with Iran's client Hizballah, the
US presence in the Persian Gulf, shipping through the Strait of Hormuz,
or some other issue, do we believe that Iran would immediately
capitulate? Or is it possible that Iran would push back, possibly
brandishing nuclear weapons in an attempt to coerce its adversaries? If
the latter, there is a risk that proliferation to Iran could result in
nuclear war and proliferation optimists are wrong to dismiss it out of
hand. [An optimist might counter that nuclear weapons will never be
used, even in a crisis situation, because states have such a strong
incentive]{.underline}, namely national survival, to ensure that nuclear
weapons are not used. [But this objection ignores the fact that leaders
operate under competing pressures]{.underline}. [Leaders in
nuclear-armed states also have strong incentives to convince their
adversaries that nuclear weapons might be used.]{.underline}
Historically [we have seen that leaders take actions in crises, such as
**placing nuclear weapons on high alert** and **delegating nuclear
launch authority to low-level commanders**, to **purposely increase the
risk of nuclear war** in an attempt to force less-resolved opponents to
back down.]{.underline} Moreover, not even the optimists' first
principles about the irrelevance of nuclear posture stand up to
scrutiny. [Not all nuclear wars would be equally devastating.43 Any
nuclear exchange would have devastating consequences no doubt, but, if a
crisis were to spiral out of control and result in nuclear war, any sane
leader would rather face a country with five nuclear weapons than one
with 5,000]{.underline}. Similarly, any sane leader would be willing to
run a greater risk of nuclear war against the former state than against
the latter. Indeed, scholars have demonstrated that states are willing
to run greater risks and are, therefore, more likely to win nuclear
crises when they enjoy nuclear superiority over their opponents.44
[Proliferation optimists might be correct that no rational leader would
choose to launch a suicidal nuclear war, but, depending on the context,
**any sane leader would almost certainly be willing to risk
one**]{.underline}. Nuclear deterrence theorists have also proposed a
second scenario under which [rational leaders would be willing to
instigate a]{.underline} nuclear exchange: [limited nuclear
war]{.underline}.45 For example, [by launching a single nuclear weapon
against a small city, a nuclear-armed state could signal its willingness
to escalate a crisis]{.underline}, while leaving its adversary with
enough left to lose to deter the adversary from launching a full-scale
nuclear response. In a future crisis between China and the United
States, for example, China could choose to launch a nuclear strike on a
US military base in East Asia to demonstrate its seriousness. In that
situation, with the continental United States intact, would Washington
choose to launch a full-scale nuclear war on China that could result in
the destruction of many American cities? Or would it back down? China
might decide to strike after calculating that Washington would prefer a
humiliating retreat over a full-scale nuclear war. [If launching a
limited nuclear war could be a rational strategic move under certain
circumstances, it then follows that **the spread of nuclear weapons
increases the risk of nuclear use**]{.underline}. To be sure, some
strategic thinkers, including Henry Kissinger, advocated limited nuclear
war as a viable strategy only to recant the position later due to fears
of uncontrollable escalation. Yet, this does not change the fact that
[leading nuclear deterrence theorists maintain that limited nuclear war
is possible among rational leaders in a MAD world]{.underline}.46

### SCOTUS

#### A trump second term permanently shifts the balance of the Supreme Court to the right -- guarantees erosion of worker protections and reproductive rights

**Starr, 2019** (Paul, professor of sociology and public affairs at
Princeton and a winner of the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction,
"Trump's Second Term," The Atlantic, May,
https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/05/trump-2020-second-term/585994/)

Finally, [a second term for Trump would entrench changes at
home]{.underline}, perhaps **[the most durable of which involves the
Supreme Court]{.underline}**. [With a full eight years, he would
probably have the opportunity to replace two more justices]{.underline}:
Ruth Bader [Ginsburg]{.underline} [will be 87]{.underline} at the
beginning of the next presidential term, [and]{.underline} Stephen
[Breyer will be 82.]{.underline} Whether you regard the prospect of four
Trump-appointed justices as a good or a bad thing will depend on your
politics and preferences---but there is no denying that **[the impact on
the nation's highest court would be momentous]{.underline}**. Not since
Richard Nixon has a president named four new Supreme Court justices, and
not since Franklin D. Roosevelt has one had the opportunity to alter the
Court's ideological balance so decisively. [In Nixon's time,
conservatives did not approach court vacancies with a clear conception
of their judicial objectives]{.underline} or with carefully vetted
candidates; both Nixon and Gerald Ford appointed justices who ended up
on the Court's liberal wing. [Since then, however, the conservative
movement has built a formidable legal network designed to
ensure]{.underline} [that]{.underline} future [judicial
vacancies]{.underline} [would not be squandered]{.underline}. The
justices nominated by recent Republican presidents reflect this shift.
But [because the Court's conservative majorities have remained slim, a
series of Republican appointees]{.underline}---Sandra Day O'Connor,
Anthony Kennedy, and most recently John Roberts---[have]{.underline},
[by occasionally breaking ranks, held the Court back from a full-scale
reversal of liberal principles]{.underline} and precedents. **[With a
7--2 rather than a 5--4 majority, however, the Court's conservatives
could no longer be checked]{.underline}** by a lone swing vote. Much of
the [public discussion about the Court's future focuses on Roe v.
Wade]{.underline} and other decisions expanding rights, protecting free
speech, or mandating separation of Church and state. Much [less public
attention has been paid to conservative activists' interest in reversing
precedents]{.underline} [that]{.underline} since the New Deal era [have
enabled the federal government to regulate labor and the
economy]{.underline}. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
conservative justices regularly struck down laws and regulations such as
limits on work hours. Only in 1937, after ruling major New Deal programs
unconstitutional, did the Court uphold a state minimum-wage law. In the
decades that followed, [the Court invoked the Constitution's commerce
clause]{.underline}, which authorizes Congress to regulate interstate
commerce, [as the basis for upholding laws regulating virtually any
activity affecting the economy]{.underline}. A great deal of federal
law, from labor standards to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to health and
environmental regulation, rests on that foundation. But [the Court's
conservative majority has recently been chipping away at the expansive
interpretation of the commerce clause]{.underline}, and some jurists on
the right want to return to the pre-1937 era, [thereby sharply limiting
the government's regulatory powers]{.underline}. In 2012, the Court's
five conservative justices held that the Affordable Care Act's penalty
for failing to obtain insurance---the so-called individual mandate---was
not justified by the commerce clause. In a sweeping dissent from the
majority's opinion, four of those justices voted to strike down the
entire ACA for that reason. The law survived only because the fifth
conservative, Chief Justice Roberts, held that the mandate was a
constitutional exercise of the government's taxing power. [If the Court
had included seven conservative justices in 2012, it would almost
certainly have declared the ACA null and void]{.underline}. **[This is
the fate awaiting much existing social and economic legislation and
regulation if Trump is reelected]{.underline}**. And that's to say
nothing of future legislation such as measures to limit climate change,
which might well be struck down by a Court adhering to an originalist
interpretation of our 18th-century Constitution. [Democracy is always a
gamble]{.underline}, but ordinarily the stakes involve short-term wins
and losses. [**Much more hangs in the balance next year.** With a second
term, Trump's presidency would go from an aberration to a turning point
in American history]{.underline}. But it would not usher in an era
marked by stability. The effects of climate change and the risks
associated with another nuclear arms race are bound to be convulsive.
And Trump's reelection would leave the country contending with both
dangers under the worst possible conditions, deeply alienated from
friends abroad and deeply divided at home. [The Supreme
Court]{.underline}, furthermore, [would be far out of line with public
opinion and at the center of political conflict]{.underline}, much as
the Court was in the 1930s before it relented on the key policies of the
New Deal. The choice Americans face in 2020 is one we will not get to
make again. What remains to be seen is whether voters will grasp the
stakes before them. In 2016, Hillary Clinton's emails absorbed more
media and public attention than any other issue. In 2018, Trump tried to
focus attention on a ragtag caravan of a few thousand Central Americans
approaching the southern border. That effort failed, but the master of
distraction will be back at it next year. [If we cannot focus on what
matters, we may sleepwalk into a truly perilous future.]{.underline}

#### Maintaining reproductive rights is a moral imperative

**SRI, 2013** (Sexual Rights Initiative, coalition of organizations from
Canada, Poland, India, Egypt, Argentina and South Africa, that work
together to advance human rights related to sexuality at the United
Nations; "The Decriminalization of Abortion: A Human Rights Imperative,"
August,
https://www.oursplatform.org/wp-content/uploads/SRI-Decriminalization-of-Abortion-Position-Paper_2013_Final.pdf)

**[Reproductive rights are human rights]{.underline}**, [and they
include the right to safe, accessible, and legal
abortions]{.underline}.1 Over 40 million abortions take place each
year.2 In most developed countries and in many developing countries,
abortion is legal on demand until the 12th or 14th week of pregnancy,
and abortion is legal beyond that timeframe when there is a threat to
the woman's life or health, or fetal impairment, or when the pregnancy
is a result of rape or incest. Nevertheless, [the majority of women of
childbearing age live in countries where abortion is much more
restricted]{.underline}, [and nearly 20% of women ages 15 through 44
live in countries where abortion is not permitted at all]{.underline} or
is only permitted when necessary to save the woman's life.3
**[Criminalizing abortion drives the market for abortions
underground]{.underline}**, [leading to an increase in]{.underline}
clandestine, [unsafe abortions]{.underline}. Unsafe abortions are
defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as procedures for
terminating unintended pregnancies carried out either by persons lacking
the necessary skills or in an environment that does not conform to
minimal medical standards, or both.4 In fact, [the WHO categorizes all
illegally performed abortions as "unsafe,]{.underline}" in part [due to
the unlikelihood that a woman experiencing post-abortion complications
will seek and receive timely medical care]{.underline} in such an
environment. The WHO estimates that 22 million abortions are performed
unsafely each year.5 The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right
to health describes the prevalence of abortion criminalization worldwide
as follows: In States where abortion is criminalized, particular grounds
for seeking an abortion may be exempt from criminalization. In the most
severe cases, however, abortion is completely criminalized without
exception --- a situation that exists in only a handful of States --- or
allowed only to save the life of the woman. Approximately 25 per cent of
the world's population lives under legal regimes that prohibit all
abortions except for those following rape or incest, as well as those
necessary to save a woman's life. Slightly less restrictive legal
regimes permit abortion on a number of physical health, mental health
and socio-economic grounds, such as poverty and number of children.
Finally, abortion is unrestricted on any grounds in 56 States, though
limits still exist with respect to how late in pregnancy an abortion
will be permitted.6 [The criminalization of abortion]{.underline} --
either by punishing the women who choose to have abortions or by
punishing the service providers that perform them **[-- violates women's
reproductive rights, leads to devastating health consequences, and has a
disproportionately grave impact on the most vulnerable women in the
world.]{.underline}** [It is therefore of vital importance that
countries with restrictive abortion laws change those laws and make
legal abortion a real, accessible option for all women]{.underline}.

#### Worker protections are an ethical priority

**Mantouvalou, 2014** (Virginia, Co-Director of the University College
London (UCL) Human Rights Institute, and Reader in Human Rights and
Labour Law in the Faculty of Laws at UCL; "Workers' rights really are
human rights," OpenGlobalRights, October 21,
https://www.openglobalrights.org/workers-rights-really-are-human-rights/)

[Most of us spend most of our lives working]{.underline}. **[This means
that workers' rights]{.underline}**, such as freedom of association, the
right to strike, the prohibition of slavery, servitude, forced and
compulsory labour, and the right to fair and just working conditions,
**[are vital]{.underline}**. When employers treat their workers with
respect, the workplace can be a place of self-fulfilment. When they
treat workers with contempt, however, it turns into a site of
exploitation and humiliation. But are workers' rights really human
rights? [A few workers' rights are codified in international
treaties]{.underline} protecting civil and political rights, such as the
right to form and join trade unions. Other workers' rights, including
the right to work, strike or have fair and just working conditions, are
mentioned only in treaties dealing with economic and social rights.
[Yet]{.underline} [since many view social rights treaties as
weaker]{.underline} because they are not "justiciable" in a court of
law, [some say social rights are mere "aspirations"]{.underline}, rather
than "real" human rights. Others disagree, claiming that all human
rights are interdependent. [You cannot protect some human rights and
neglect others, because they are mutually supportive]{.underline}.
Workers' rights exemplify this connection. **[The right to work means
little, unless there is also a right to decent work]{.underline}**; [one
cannot claim that the right to work is protected when workers are
exploited]{.underline}. Also the prohibition of slavery, servitude,
forced and compulsory labour cannot be separated from the right to
decent work. Still, classification of workers' rights as human rights is
controversial. Consider, for example, debates between proponents of
rights of workers on solidarity and human rights, or on rights and
workers' power. Many of these debates focus on trade union rights, which
are important because of the unequal bargaining power between employers
and workers. Some activists use the law and courts to promote workers'
interests, while others use human rights language to emphasise the
morally important nature of workers' claims. Sceptics, however, believe
human rights are individualistic and thus fundamentally different from
workers' collective rights. They fear that focusing on individual human
rights, rather than group worker rights, will undermine worker
solidarity. Making individual claims does not necessarily harm other
strategies, however, and can sometimes complement them. Collective
labour rights are framed as individual rights in human rights treaties,
but are there in order to help people pursue collective, solidaristic
goals. For example the European Convention on Human Rights protects the
right to form and join a trade union for the promotion of workers'
interests. It is clear in the text, and has been supported by case law,
that unionising is protected in order to pursue the interests of workers
and to promote their collective goals. At the same time, trade unions
can bring claims too---it is not only individual workers that can use
the legal machineries in place. In fact, one of the most notorious cases
on trade union rights in Europe was brought by individuals and unions
together. Strategies, of course, vary on circumstances and context. In
Europe, labour rights activists have recently been successful in taking
cases to the European Court of Human Rights, which has ruled that the
right to strike is essential for freedom of association and has issued
rulings protecting migrant domestic workers. In Latin America, the
Inter-American Court of Human Rights has said that the rights of
undocumented workers are indeed human rights, in a most insightful way,
by arguing that workers' rights depend on the status of being human, and
not on someone's status as a documented migrant. Outside the courts,
activists have successfully presented workers' claims as human rights.
Human Rights Watch, for instance, recently issued a powerful report on
migrant domestic workers in the UK. The report discusses workers' rights
(like minimum wage and maximum working time) as human rights,
exemplifying how "human rights are also about social justice." [Beyond
courts,]{.underline} [legal entitlements for workers can give focus and
impetus to campaigns of activists and ultimately award greater
dignity]{.underline}. This can be exemplified by recent debates in the
UK around new "modern slavery" legislation. These debates have empowered
organisations and given focus to campaigns promoting workers' rights and
human rights. [Connecting workers' rights to human rights shows that
workers' rights are vital, and\... in most cases, trump arguments of
profit and efficiency]{.underline}. Human rights are, above all, moral
claims about the normative standards towards which all decent societies
should strive. As moral claims, rights are grounded in human dignity,
citizenship and equality, all of which individuals must enjoy both
outside and within the workplace. [Both states and employers are bound
to respect human rights principles for their citizens and their workers.
**Connecting workers' rights to human rights shows that workers' rights
are vital, and must not be traded off casually**]{.underline}. They
should, in most cases, trump arguments of profit and efficiency. [Human
rights are valuable for workers. They give workers a voice and offer
political and moral space for the most vulnerable of
groups,]{.underline} such as the unorganised, under-skilled, and
undocumented. They demand that the law protect workers, and that no one
can easily do away with them. [Finally, with human rights to back them,
workers are able to refuse exploitation done in the name of
efficiency.]{.underline}

### Immigration

#### Re-election enables trump's restrictive immigration policy.

**Stanage**, 5/20/**2019** (Niall, Irish journalist and Associate Editor
of the American political newspaper, The Hill; "The Memo: Trump
second-term agenda begins to emerge," The Hill,
https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/444446-the-memo-trump-second-term-agenda-begins-to-emerge)

[Trump unveiled his new immigration plan]{.underline} at the White House
on [Thursday]{.underline}. [It centers on a pledge to move from a green
card system]{.underline} primarily based around family relationships [to
one primarily based around education and job skills]{.underline}. The
president all but admitted his proposal faced little chance of being
signed into law in the current Congress, with Democrats in control of
the House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called it "dead on arrival."
But [Trump held out the possibility that his supporters could see the
plan come to fruition]{.underline} [if only they would reelect him ---
and put Republicans back in control of a unified government --- come
2020]{.underline}. "[If for some reason]{.underline} --- possibly
political --- [we can\'t get the Democrats to approve this]{.underline}
merit-based, [high-security plan, **then we will get it approved
immediately after the election**]{.underline}, when we take back the
House, keep the Senate, and, of course, hold the presidency," he told
the audience in the Rose Garden. To some, the plan looked less like a
serious attempt at legislation and more like a first shot in the 2020
messaging wars --- aiming to paint Democrats as obstructionists and
giving Republicans a relatively uncontroversial plan to coalesce around.
Its acceptability in GOP circles comes at a price, however --- it lacks
specifics on the thorniest parts of the immigration issue. [It does not
address the fate of millions of people currently living in the United
States without authorization, nor does it provide any resolution for the
recipients of DACA]{.underline} --- the Obama-era Deferred Action for
Childhood Arrivals program --- which Trump ended.

#### These policies fuel white supremacy -- rejecting racism comes first

**Srikantiah and Sinnar, 2019** (Jayashri, Professor of Law and the
founding Director of the Stanford Law School Immigrants' Rights Clinic;
Shirin, Associate Professor of Law and the John A. Wilson Distinguished
Faculty Scholar at Stanford Law School; "White Nationalism as
Immigration Policy," Stanford Law Review Online, Volume 71, March,
https://review.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/02/71-Stan.-L.-Rev.-Srikantiah-Sinnar.pdf)

[Two years into the Trump presidency, white nationalism may be driving
the Administration's immigration policy]{.underline}. We view white
nationalism as "the belief that national identity should be built around
white ethnicity, and that white people should therefore maintain both a
demographic majority and dominance of the nation's culture and public
life."1 We do not use the term lightly, nor view all restrictions on
immigration as inherently racist. Nonetheless, our review of the Trump
Administration's rhetoric and policies affecting nonwhite immigrants
suggests this motivation.2 This Essay argues that legal challenges to
Trump's restrictive immigration policies should call out white
nationalism as the underlying harm, both through raising equal
protection claims and in presenting the overall theory of the case.
Despite longstanding barriers to equality claims in immigration law,
[asserting these claims can frame public and political understanding of
the issues at stake, support social movements challenging racialized
immigration enforcement, and offer an alternative vision for immigration
law that rejects both racial criteria and the exceptional judicial
deference long accorded to the political branches in immigration
decisions]{.underline}. I. The White Nationalism Behind Immigration
Policy A. Rhetoric [The President's statements and policies suggest that
he views U.S. national identity in racial terms]{.underline} and seeks
to preserve the nation's predominantly white identity. As a general
matter, the President has parroted ideas of white cultural threat
popular among white nationalists. [For instance, on multiple occasions,
Trump excoriated the removal of Confederate monuments as a threat to
"our culture"]{.underline}3---identifying "our culture" with memorials
erected to send a message of white supremacy in the name of a war fought
to protect slavery.4 He gestured at the notion of a "white genocide"---a
rallying cry of white nationalists worldwide---by tweeting support for
South African far-right claims that white farmers were suffering from
mass killings and land seizures in that country.5 [Most
notably]{.underline}, following the largest U.S. gathering of white
supremacists in a generation, [the President insisted that some who
marched in Charlottesville were "very fine people]{.underline}."6 With
respect to immigration, [Trump has repeatedly disparaged various groups
of nonwhite immigrants]{.underline}. [He began]{.underline} his
presidential campaign [by denouncing Mexican migrants as
"rapists]{.underline}."7 He allegedly commented [that Haitian immigrants
"all have AIDS]{.underline}" [and that Nigerian immigrants would never
"go back to their huts" after seeing the U.S]{.underline}. 8 He
repeatedly conflated Middle Eastern and Muslim immigrants with
terrorists9 and falsely claimed that most people convicted of terrorism
in the U.S. came from abroad.10 In addition, Trump has trafficked in
age-old racist tropes, portraying immigrants as criminals, invaders,11
threats to women,12 and even subhuman. [On one occasion, Trump described
unauthorized immigrants as "animals]{.underline};"13 on another, he
conjured images of vermin in describing immigrants as threatening to
"pour into and infest our Country."14 [Perhaps most infamously, he
reportedly railed against immigration from "shithole
countries]{.underline}"---an apparent reference to Haiti, El Salvador,
and African nations---[and asked why the U.S. couldn't get more people
from countries like Norway]{.underline}.15 The President's comments on
immigration to Europe even more strongly suggest that he views
immigration as a cultural threat to the U.S.---not just an economic or
security challenge. He called immigration to Europe a "shame" and stated
that it had "changed the fabric of Europe" and that Europeans "are
losing \[their\] culture."16 He railed against the German government,
which had (at one point) welcomed Syrian refugees, calling it a "\[b\]ig
mistake made all over Europe in allowing millions of people in who have
so strongly and violently changed their culture!"17 Lest some might read
these statements as pertaining to Europe alone, Trump drew a direct
connection to the U.S.: "We don't want what is happening with
immigration in Europe to happen with us!"18 Putting together the
President's claims of cultural threat from immigration with his
vilification of nonwhite immigrants, these statements suggest support
for white nationalist ideas. [Even if certain remarks might be
challenged]{.underline} as insufficiently proven or susceptible of
non-racist meanings, [the record as a whole cannot be read in
race-neutral terms.19 Nor should the fact that nonracial motivations for
restricting immigration can exist sanitize the reasons Trump has
actually expressed for curtailing immigration.]{.underline} B. Policies
[The]{.underline} Trump [Administration's immigration policies reflect
its white nationalist rhetoric]{.underline}. The [Administration has
issued]{.underline} a dizzying array of [policy changes that explicitly
target or disproportionately affect noncitizens of color]{.underline} at
the same time that President Trump's statements reflect racist intent.
These policy changes represent the most wide-ranging Executive Branch
attempt to restrict immigration policies in generations. [Shortly
after]{.underline} President [Trump's inauguration]{.underline} in 2017,
[the Administration instituted the first iteration of the]{.underline}
Muslim [Travel Ban]{.underline}, barring certain noncitizens from
Muslim-majority countries from admission to this country.20 [In 2017 and
2018, the Administration ended]{.underline} Temporary Protected Status
([TPS]{.underline}) for noncitizens from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua,
and Sudan, granted and renewed by prior administrations (for decades in
some cases) to protect people unable to return to their home countries
because of armed conflict, natural disasters, or other conditions.21
[Numerous Trump Administration policies are designed to limit grants of
status to Mexican and Central American immigrants]{.underline}. [In
2017]{.underline} President [Trump rescinded the]{.underline} Deferred
Action for Childhood Arrivals [(DACA) program]{.underline}, under which
individuals who had entered the country without papers as children could
obtain work permits.22 Ninety-four percent of DACA recipients are
Latino.23 The Department of [Justice has also targeted Mexican and
Central American refugees by heightening the standard that
asylum-seekers fleeing domestic violence must meet]{.underline}24 and
implementing (later rescinded) draconian family separation policies.25
The Administration is now defending a recent presidential proclamation
that attempted to restrict the rights of individuals within the U.S. to
apply for asylum, contrary to the plain language of the immigration
statutes and this country's longstanding practice.26 [The Trump
Administration has also dramatically escalated enforcement and
detention]{.underline},27 attempted to move deportation cases so quickly
in immigration court as to preclude noncitizens from preparing a defense
or finding attorneys,28 [slowed down and tightened visa
issuances]{.underline},29 [and planned to restrict severely the ability
of certain indigent immigrants to obtain green cards]{.underline},
[regardless of]{.underline} the strength of [family ties.]{.underline}30
[The Administration has also markedly increased efforts to denaturalize
U.S. citizens]{.underline}.31 While these changes do not, on their face,
target a specific group of noncitizens, the demographics of immigration
to this country mean that their impact falls predominantly on
noncitizens of color.32 It is true that neither nationality distinctions
in immigration law nor efforts to control immigration are new. But the
President's racist statements and the breadth of the changes to
immigration policy distinguish this Administration from prior efforts to
restrict immigration. Moreover, while it is fairly easy to link certain
immigration policies, like the Muslim Travel Ban or the termination of
TPS for Haitians, to the President's hostile comments about those
groups, the President's statements cast doubt on the intent behind a
wider swath of immigration policies[. To the extent that the President's
statements reflect a view of U.S. national identity as centered in white
identity, they render immigration policies suspect even if the President
has not disparaged the particular nonwhite nationalities
affected.]{.underline}

### A2 Trump Good -- Climate

#### Claims of climate success are all hype -- a trump presidency dooms the climate

**Romm, 2019** (Joe, founding editor, "Trump campaign plans to gaslight
American people on climate change and clean energy," ThinkProgress,
April 3,
https://thinkprogress.org/trump-campaign-climate-change-clean-energy-a45eeb1a00b3/)

President Donald [Trump has led the most anti-climate and anti-clean
energy administration in U.S. history]{.underline}. [He]{.underline} has
[gutted Obama]{.underline}-era [clean air rules]{.underline}, [appointed
climate]{.underline} science [deniers to key posts]{.underline},
[slashed]{.underline} the [budgets for renewable energy]{.underline}
development, [and he's]{.underline} the only world leader to start the
process of [withdrawing from the]{.underline} 2015 [Paris]{.underline}
climate [agreement]{.underline}. Squaring that reality with recent polls
that show growing public support for climate action puts his reelection
effort in an impossible position. [Trump's 2020 campaign
strategy]{.underline}, therefore[, will seemingly involve rewriting
history]{.underline} --- [touting nonexistent "climate change
victories"]{.underline} [while continuing to attack climate
science]{.underline}, McClatchy reported Tuesday. The challenge for the
campaign is that Trump, who has long argued climate science is a "hoax,"
keeps telling lies so outrageous that few outside his core supporters
believe him anymore. Tuesday evening, for instance, the president was
speaking to House Republicans about wind power and bizarrely asserted,
"They say the noise causes cancer." There is literally no scientific
basis for that claim, and he was widely mocked on Twitter. The claim
that wind farms hurt property values is also false. For the record, the
energy source that kills thousands of Americans a year and has actually
been linked to cancer clinically is coal. As a January study from the
Harvard School for Public Health concluded, "The more a country relies
on coal-fired power plants to generate energy, the greater the lung
cancer risk is among its citizens." Nonetheless, [Trump has been trying
to resurrect coal and kill climate action for two years]{.underline}.
"The most destructive action on Trump's part," as climatologist Michael
Mann explained to ThinkProgress in January, has been his effort to
withdraw from the Paris climate accord, "an agreement that every other
country in the world has signed on to." So it is jaw-dropping that
McClatchy's story says Trump's 2020 campaign is looking for "climate
change victories" in key states to tout, according to sources close to
the campaign. "There's been a lot of discussion around how easy it would
be to be stack up victories on an issue that really matters in states
that really matter," one such source said. [You may be
wondering]{.underline} exactly [what easy victories on climate the Trump
administration could]{.underline} possibly [claim]{.underline}, given
its disastrous pro-coal, pro-pollution record. "[Topping a list,"
reports]{.underline} Michael [Wilner, a McClatchy White House
correspondent]{.underline}, "[is their claim that U.S. greenhouse gas
emissions decreased in Trump's first year]{.underline} in office." [The
campaign plans to "argue that private sector innovation]{.underline} ---
not regulations --- [have proven]{.underline} under the Trump presidency
to be a more [effective]{.underline} method of cutting emissions from
major industrial sources." [There is only one small problem]{.underline}
with this Orwellian strategy. **[Carbon pollution from utilities and
other industrial sources spiked 3.4 percent in 2018]{.underline}**,
Trump's second year in office --- [the second biggest yearly jump in
over 20 years]{.underline}. [Carbon dioxide emissions are]{.underline}
now [much higher since Trump took office]{.underline}. And [everything
the administration is currently doing ensures emissions will not decline
sharply for the foreseeable future]{.underline} --- particularly the
efforts to gut Obama-era rules designed to improve vehicle fuel
efficiency and cut power plant emissions. [Meanwhile, Trump has been
lying nonstop about the Green New Deal]{.underline}, a proposal
introduced by Democrats and others to mobilize clean energy fast enough
to stop catastrophic climate change. He's claimed it will cost \$100
trillion and mean "no more airplanes, no more cows." Fact-checkers keep
debunking these falsehoods, but even they are overwhelmed by the more
than 9,000 false or misleading claims the president has made since
taking office. So just as with other key Trump campaign strategies ---
such as touting Republicans as the "party of health care" --- [the plan
to persuade the public that Trump has climate change victories to claim
is built on a foundation of smoke and lies]{.underline}.

### A2 Util Good

#### Evaluate slow violence first

**Nixon 11** (Rob, Rachel Carson Professor of English and an affiliate
of the Nelson Institute Center for Culture, History and Environment
"Book excerpt: Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor,
continued",
http://nelson.wisc.edu/news/in-common/fall-winter2013/story.php?s=1439&page=1)
ALH

[Three primary concerns animate this book, chief among them my
conviction that we urgently need to rethink politically, imaginatively,
and theoretically what I call "slow violence." By slow violence I mean a
violence that occurs gradually and out of sight, a violence of delayed
destruction that is dispersed across time and space, an attritional
violence that is typically not viewed as violence at all.]{.underline}
Violence is customarily conceived as an event or action that is
immediate in time, explosive and spectacular in space, and as erupting
into instant sensational visibility. [We need]{.underline}, I believe,
[to engage a different kind of violence,]{.underline} a violence [that
is neither spectacular nor instantaneous, but rather incremental and
accretive,]{.underline} its calamitous repercussions [playing out across
a range of temporal scales.]{.underline} In so doing, we also need to
engage the representational, narrative, andstrategic challenges posed by
the relative invisibility of slow violence. Climate change, the thawing
cryosphere, toxic drift, biomagnification, deforestation, the
radioactive aftermaths of wars, acidifying oceans, and a hostof other
slowly unfolding environmental catastrophes present formidable
representational obstacles that can hinder our efforts to mobilize and
act decisively. [The long dyings---the staggered and staggeringly
discounted casualties, both human and ecological that result from war's
toxic aftermaths or introduction climate change---are underrepresented
in strategic planning as well as in human memory.]{.underline} Had
Summers advocated invading Africa with weapons of mass destruction, his
proposal would have fallen under conventional definitions of violence
and been perceived as a military or even an imperial invasion.
Advocating invading countries with mass forms of slow-motion toxicity,
however, requires rethinking our accepted as sumptions of violence to
include slow violence. Such a rethinking requires that we complicate
conventional assumptions about violence as a highly visible act that is
newsworthy because it is event focused, time bound, and body bound. We
need to account for how the temporal dispersion of slow violence affects
the way we perceive and respond to a variety of social afflictions ---
from domestic abuse to posttraumatic stress and, in particular,
environmental calamities. A major challenge is representational: how to
devise arresting stories, images, and symbols adequate to the pervasive
but elusive violence of delayed effects. Crucially, slow violence is
often not just attritional but also exponential, operating as a major
threat multiplier; it can fuel long-term, proliferating conflicts
insituations where the conditions for sustaining life become
increasingly but gradually degraded. [Politically and emotionally,
different kinds of disaster possess unequal heft.]{.underline} Falling
bodies, burning towers, exploding heads, avalanches, volcanoes, and
tsunamis have a visceral, eye-catching and page-turning power that tales
of slow violence, unfolding over years, decades, even centuries, cannot
match. [Stories of toxic buildup, massing greenhouse gases, and
accelerated species loss due to ravaged habitats are all cataclysmic,
but they are scientifically convoluted cataclysms in which casualties
are postponed, often for generations.]{.underline} [In an age when the
media venerate the spectacular, when public policy is shaped primarily
around perceived immediate need, a central question is strategic and
representational: how can we convert into image and narrative the
disasters that are slow moving and long in the making, disasters that
are anonymous and that star nobody, disasters that are attritional and
of indifferent interest to the sensation-driven technologies of our
image-world?]{.underline} How can we turn the long emergencies of slow
violence into stories dramatic enough to rouse public sentiment and
warrant political intervention, these emergencies whose repercussions
have given rise to some of the most critical challenges of our time?
Slow Violence In this book, I have sought to address our inattention to
calamities that are slow and long lasting, calamities that patiently
dispense their devastation while remaining outside our flickering
attention spans and outside the purview of a spectacle-driven corporate
media. [The insidious workings of slow violence derive largely from the
unequal attention given to spectacular and unspectacular
time.]{.underline} In an age that venerates instant spectacle, slow
violence is deficient in the recognizable special effects that fill
movie theaters and boost ratings on TV. Chemical and radiological
violence, for example, is driven inward, somatized into cellular dramas
of mutationthat particularly in the bodies of the poor remain largely
unobserved, undiagnosed, and untreated. From a narrative perspective,
such [invisible, mutagenic theater is slow paced and open ended, eluding
the tidy closure, the containment, imposed by the visual orthodoxies of
victory and defeat]{.underline}. Let me ground this point by referring,
in conjunction, to Rachel Carson's Silent Spring and Frantz Fanon's The
Wretched of the Earth. In 1962 Silent Spring jolted a broad
international public into an awareness of the protracted, cryptic, and
indiscriminate casualties inflicted by dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane
(DDT). Yet, just one year earlier, Fanon, in the opening pages of
Wretched of the Earth, had comfortably invoked DDT as an affirmative
metaphor for anticolonial violence: he called for a DDT-filled spray gun
to be wielded as a weapon against the "parasites" spread by the
colonials' Christian church. Fanon's drama of decolonization is, of
course, studded with the overt weaponry whereby subjugation is
maintained ("by dint of a great array of bayonets and cannons") or
overthrown ("by the searing bullets and bloodstained knives") after "a
murderous and decisive struggle between the two protagonists." Yet his
temporal vision of violence and of what Aimé Césaire called "the
rendezvous of victory" was uncomplicated by the concerns that an as-yet
inchoate environmental justice movement (catalyzed in part by Silent
Spring) would raise about lopsided risks that permeate the land long
term, blurring the clean lines between defeat and victory, between
colonial dispossession and official national self-determination. We can
certainly read Fanon, in his concern with land as property and as fount
of native dignity, retrospectively with an environmental eye. But our
theories of violence today must be informed by a science unavailable to
Fanon, a science that addresses environmentally embedded violence that
is often difficult to source, oppose, and once set in motion, to
reverse. [Attritional catastrophes that overspill clear boundaries in
time and space are marked above all by displacements temporal,
geographical, rhetorical, and technological displacements that simplify
violence and underestimate, in advance and in retrospect, the human and
environmental costs. Such displacements smooth the way for
amnesia,]{.underline} as places are rendered irretrievable to those who
once inhabited them, places that ordinarily pass unmourned in the
corporate media. Places like the Marshall Islands, subjected between
1948 and 1958 to sixty-seven American atmospheric nuclear "tests," the
largest of them equal in force to 1,000 Hiroshima-sized bombs. In 1956
the Atomic Energy Commission declared the Marshall Islands "by far the
most contaminated place in the world," a condition that would compromise
independence in the long term, despite the islands' formal ascent in
1979 into the ranks of self-governing nations. The island republic was
still in part governed by an irradiated past: well into the 1980s its
history of nuclear colonialism, long forgotten by the colonizers, was
still delivering into the world "jellyfish babies" headless, eyeless,
limbless human infants who would live for just a few hours. If, as Said
notes, struggles over geography are never reducible to armed struggle
but have a profound symbolic and narrative component as well, and if, as
Michael Watts insists, [we must attend to the "violent geographies of
fast capitalism," **we need to supplement** both these **injunctions
with a deeper understanding of the slow violence of delayed effects that
structures so many of our most consequential forgettings**]{.underline}.
**[Violence]{.underline}**, above all environmental violence, [**needs
to be seen and deeply considered as a contest** not only over space, or
bodies, or labor, or resources, but also **over time.**]{.underline} We
need to bear in mind Faulkner's dictum that "the past is never dead.
It's not even past." His words resonate with particular force across
landscapes permeated by slow violence, landscapes of temporal overspill
that elude rhetorical cleanup operations with their sanitary beginnings
and endings. Kwame Anthony Appiah famously asked, "Is the 'Post-' in
'Postcolonial' the 'Post-' in 'Postmodern'?" As environmentalists we
might ask similarly searching questions of the "post" in postindustrial,
post--Cold War, and postconflict. For if the past of slow violence is
never past, so too the post is never fully post: industrial particulates
and effluents live on in the environmental elements we inhabit and in
our very bodies,which epidemiologically and ecologically are never our
simple contemporaries. Something similar applies to so-called
postconflict societies whose leaders may annually commemorate, as marked
on the calendar, the official cessation of hostilities, while ongoing
intergenerational slow violence (inflicted by, say, unexploded landmines
or carcinogens from an arms dump) may continue hostilities by other
means. Ours is an age of onrushing turbo-capitalism, wherein the present
feels more abbreviated than it used to at least for the world's
privileged classes who live surrounded by technological time-savers that
often compound the sensation of not having enough time. [Consequently,
one of the most pressing challenges of our age is how to adjust our
rapidly eroding attention spans to the slow erosions of environmental
justice.]{.underline} If, under neoliberalism, the gulf between enclaved
rich and outcast poor has become ever more pronounced, ours is also an
era of enclaved time wherein for many speed has become a
self-justifying, [propulsive ethic that renders "uneventful" violence
(to those who live remote from its attritional lethality) a weak
claimant on our time.]{.underline} The attosecond pace of our age, with
its restless technologies of infinite promise and infinite
disappointment, prompts us to keepflicking and clicking distractedly in
an insatiable and often insensate quest for quicker sensation. "One of
the most pressing challenges of our age is how to adjust our rapidly
eroding attention spans to the slow erosions of environ- mental
justice." [The oxymoronic notion of slow violence poses a number of
challenges: scientific, legal, political, and
representational.]{.underline} In the long arc between the emergence of
slow violence and its delayed effects, both the causes and the memory of
catastrophe readily fade from view as the casualties incurred typically
pass untallied and unremembered. [Such discounting in turn makes it far
more difficult to secure effective legal measures for prevention,
restitution, and redress. Casualties from slow violence are, moreover,
out of sync not only with our narrative and media expectations but also
with the swift seasons of electoral change. Politicians routinely adopt
a "last in, first out" stance toward environmental issues,]{.underline}
admitting them when times are flush, dumping them as soon as times get
tight. Because preventative or remedial environmental legislation
typically targets slow violence, [it cannot deliver dependable electoral
cycle results, even though those results may ultimately be life
saving.]{.underline} Relative to bankable pocketbook actions there'll be
a tax rebate check in the mail next August environmental payouts seem to
lurk on a distant horizon[. Many politicians and indeed many voters
routinely treat environmental action as critical yet not urgent. And so
generation after generation of two- or four-year cyclepoliticians add to
the pileup of deferrable actions deferred.]{.underline} With rare
exceptions**[, in the domain of slow violence "yes, but not now, not
yet" becomes the modus operandi.]{.underline}** How can leaders be
goaded to avert catastrophe when the political rewards of their actions
will not accrue to them but will be reaped on someone else's watch
decades, even centuries, from now? How can environmental activists and
storytellers work to counter the potent political, corporate, and even
scientific forces invested in immediate self-interest, procrastination,
and dissembling? To address the challenges of slow violence is to
confront the dilemma Rachel Carson faced almost half a century ago as
she sought to dramatize what she eloquently called "death by
indirection." Carson's subjects were biomagnification and toxic drift,
forms of oblique, slow-acting violence that, like climate change, pose
formidable imaginative difficulties for writers and activists alike. In
struggling to give shape to amorphous menace, both Carson and reviewers
of Silent Spring resorted to a narrative vocabulary: one reviewer
portrayed the book as exposing "the new, unplotted and mysterious
dangers we insist upon creating all around us," while Carson herself
wrote of "a shadow that is no less ominous because it is formless and
obscure." [To confront slow violence requires, then, that we plot and
give figurative shape to formless threats whose fatal repercussions are
dispersed across space and time. The representational challenges are
acute, requiring creative ways of drawing public attention to
catastrophic acts that are low in instant spectacle but high in
long-term effects.]{.underline} To intervene representationally entails
devising iconic symbols that embody amorphous calamities as well as
narrative forms that infuse those symbols with dramatic urgency.

\*edited for abelist language we do not endorse

(CNN) \-- At a security conference recently, the moderator asked the
panel of distinguished cybersecurity leaders what their nightmare
scenario was. The answers were the predictable array of large-scale
attacks: against our communications infrastructure, against the power
grid, against the financial system, in combination with a physical
attack. I didn\'t get to give my answer until the afternoon, which was:
\"[My nightmare scenario is that people keep talking about their
nightmare scenarios.]{.underline}\" [There\'s a certain blindness that
comes from worst-case thinking]{.underline}. An extension of the
precautionary principle[, it involves imagining the worst possible
outcome and then acting as if it were a certainty. It substitutes
imagination for thinking, speculation for risk analysis and fear for

**[\[inaction\]]{.underline}**And [it makes us more vulnerable to the

bad decision making for several reasons. First, [it\'s only half of the
cost-benefit equation]{.underline}. Every decision has costs and
benefits, risks and rewards. By speculating about what can possibly go
wrong, and then acting as if that is likely to happen, **[worst-case

organs won\'t arrive in time for transplant operations and people will
die. If we don\'t invade Iraq, Saddam Hussein might use the nuclear
weapons he might have. If we do, we might destabilize the Middle East,
leading to widespread violence and death. Of course[, not all fears are
equal. Those that we tend to exaggerate are more easily justified by
worst-case thinking]{.underline}. So terrorism fears trump privacy
fears, and almost everything else; technology is hard to understand and
therefore scary; nuclear weapons are worse than conventional weapons;
our children need to be protected at all costs; and annihilating the
planet is bad. Basically, any fear that would make a good movie plot is
amenable to worst-case thinking. Fourth and finally, [worst-case
thinking validates ignorance]{.underline}. Instead of focusing on what
we know, [it focuses on what we don\'t know \-- and what we can
imagine.]{.underline} Remember Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld\'s
quote? \"Reports that say that something hasn\'t happened are always
interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are
things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is
to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also
unknown unknowns \-- the ones we don\'t know we don\'t know.\" And this:
\"[the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence]{.underline}.\"
Ignorance isn\'t a cause for doubt; when you can fill that ignorance
with imagination, it can be a call to action. Even worse[, it can lead
to hasty and dangerous acts. You can\'t wait for a smoking gun, so you
act as if the gun is about to go off. Rather than making us safer,
**worst-case thinking has the potential to cause dangerous
escalation.**]{.underline} The new undercurrent in this is that our
society no longer has the ability to calculate probabilities. Risk
assessment is devalued. [Probabilistic thinking is repudiated in favor
of \"possibilistic thinking\": Since we can\'t know what\'s likely to go
wrong, let\'s speculate about what can possibly go wrong. Worst-case
thinking leads to bad decisions, bad systems design, and bad
security.]{.underline} And we all have direct experience with its
effects: airline security and the TSA, which we make fun of when we\'re
not appalled that they\'re harassing 93-year-old women or keeping
first-graders off airplanes. You can\'t be too careful! Actually, you
can. You can refuse to fly because of the possibility of plane crashes.
You can lock your children in the house because of the possibility of
child predators. You can eschew all contact with people because of the
possibility of hurt. Steven Hawking wants to avoid trying to communicate
with aliens because they might be hostile; does he want to turn off all
the planet\'s television broadcasts because they\'re radiating into
space? It isn\'t hard to parody worst-case thinking, and at its extreme
it\'s a psychological condition. Frank Furedi, a sociology professor at
the University of Kent, writes: \"[Worst-case thinking encourages
society to adopt fear as one of the dominant principles around which the
public, the government and institutions should organize their life. It
institutionalizes insecurity and fosters a mood of confusion and
powerlessness]{.underline}. Through popularizing the belief that worst
cases are normal, it [incites people to feel defenseless and vulnerable
to a wide range of future threats.\"]{.underline} Even worse, it plays
directly into the hands of terrorists, creating a population that is
easily terrorized \-- even by failed terrorist attacks like the
Christmas Day underwear bomber and the Times Square SUV bomber. When
someone is proposing a change, the onus should be on them to justify it
over the status quo. But [worst case thinking is a way of looking at the
world that exaggerates the rare and unusual and gives the rare much more
credence than it deserves.]{.underline} It isn\'t really a principle;
[it\'s a cheap trick to justify what you already believe. It lets lazy
or biased people make what seem to be cogent arguments without
understanding the whole issue. And when people don\'t need to refute
counterarguments, there\'s no point in listening to them.]{.underline}

## Uniqueness

### Trump Wins -- Experts

#### Trump wins now -- expert predictions go aff

**Pitofsky, 5/30**/2019 (Marina, The Hill, "Professor who has correctly
predicted 9 presidential elections says Trump will win in 2020 unless
Democrats impeach,"
https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/446136-professor-who-has-correctly-predicted-nine-presidential-elections-says)

[An American University professor who has correctly predicted the last
nine presidential elections says President **Trump will win the 2020
election**]{.underline} unless congressional Democrats, "grow a spine,"
CNN reported. Allan [Lichtman]{.underline}, a political historian, [said
Democrats only have a shot at the White House if they begin impeachment
proceedings]{.underline} against Trump, calling the decision both
"constitutionally" and "politically" right in the wake of special
counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the
2016 presidential election. "It's a false dichotomy to say Democrats
have a choice between doing what is right and what is constitutional and
what is politically right. Impeachment is also politically right,"
Lichtman told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Wednesday. [Lichtman has developed
a system of 13 "key factors" that help determine whether the party in
the White House will maintain its hold,]{.underline} according to CNN.
[The factors range from whether the party has an]{.underline}
[incumbent]{.underline} president running [to the country's
s]{.underline}hort- and long-term [economic conditions to foreign
policy]{.underline} successes and failures. [If the party loses out on
six factors or more, he says they will lose]{.underline} the presidency.
[Lichtman says the Trump administration is down three key
factors]{.underline}: Republican [losses in the midterms]{.underline}
elections, a "[lack of foreign policy success]{.underline}" [and Trump's
"limited appeal]{.underline} to voters," CNN reported. Impeachment would
trigger a fourth key --- scandal over the proceeding's public nature.
"Let's not forget, impeachment is not just a vote in the House,"
Lichtman said. "It involves public hearings as part of the impeachment
inquiry, and, what everyone forgets, a public trial in the Senate in
which House prosecutors present evidence, present documents, make
opening and closing statements." Lichtman cited scandal as a central
factor in former Vice President Al Gore's loss in the 2000 presidential
election after President Clinton's impeachment process. \"[Democrats are
fundamentally wrong about the politics of impeachment and their
prospects for victory in 2020," Lichtman told CNN]{.underline}'s Chris
Cillizza on Tuesday.

### Trump Wins -- Popularity

#### Trump wins now -- consistent base support and upward trending approval

**Vittert and Lind, 6/11**/2019 (Liberty, professor of the Practice of
Data Science at the Olin Business School at Washington University in St.
Louis, Brendan, JD/MBA Candidate, Harvard Business School, "Donald
Trump: The most unpopular US election winner could win again in 2020,"
Business Standard,
https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/donald-trump-the-most-unpopular-us-election-winner-could-win-again-in-2020-119061100233_1.html)

Donald [Trump is the first president to ever be elected while being
actively disliked]{.underline} by the majority of Americans. Trump was
also the first person elected president who was significantly less
popular than his counterpart. Most Americans have heard of presidents
losing the popular vote but winning the election. But to win while the
majority of Americans oppose you? How is that possible? [At the time of
the election]{.underline}, [Trump had the highest unfavorability rating
in history]{.underline}, with over 61% of Americans having an
"unfavorable" view or "disapproving" of Trump. (There's also an
"undecided" option.) Luckily for Trump, he faced a historically
unpopular opponent. Before 2016, no losing presidential candidate had
had an unfavorable rating above 47%. But on election eve, Hillary
Clinton's was 52%, an unprecedented election in American history.
[Pretty soon, Americans will start to hear nothing but]{.underline}
polls, predictions and political [forecasts]{.underline} in the news
cycle for the 2020 elections. [But, as a statistician and political
polling expert, we think that there is one polling prediction device
that will be overlooked]{.underline} and misunderstood: [approval
ratings]{.underline}. Winning without the popular vote History has been
rather kind to presidents who didn't win the popular vote. Trump is the
fifth U.S. president to lose the popular vote and win the Electoral
College. All presidents have experienced a bump in popularity between
election and Inauguration Day. But only Trump still found his approval
rating -- the percent of Americans who approve of the way the president
is handling his job -- below 50% upon entering office. According to
FiveThirtyEight, the day Trump stepped into the White House, he had only
a 45.5% approval rating. This stands in stark contrast to Barack Obama,
for example, who took office with a 68% approval rating. Moreover, Trump
has the lowest approval average in history, at only 40%. The next lowest
is Harry Truman at 45.4%. These data clearly show that Trump is the
least-liked president in American history. With such unpopularity, how
could he possibly win again? Approval ratings and reelection While
election forecasting has become increasingly complex with new prediction
models and techniques, there is an unsung hero of polling predictions:
the approval ratings. Introduced by George Gallup in the late 1920s,
[presidential approval ratings aim]{.underline}ed [to gauge the level of
public support for the sitting president]{.underline} at any given time
during his presidency. [Every]{.underline} single reelected
[president]{.underline} [since approval rating polls began]{.underline}
[has had over]{.underline} a [50%]{.underline} approval rating [when
reelected, or been on an upward approval rating trend]{.underline} over
30 days before the election. If neither of those is satisfied, the
incumbent loses. It has been that simple. As with any statistical
analysis, [the trends are more important than the raw
numbers]{.underline}. The 2016 election was historically unprecedented
in terms of favorability of the candidates, as is the political
polarization of the U.S. Look at the spread [We]{.underline} think that
pollsters, and the general public, [shouldn't compare Trump's approval
ratings to past presidents]{.underline}. What can be compared? The
difference of highs and lows. [According to historical Gallup polls,
Trump's spread]{.underline} -- the difference between the highest
recorded and lowest recorded approval rating poll -- [has never been
more than 13%.]{.underline} [Not a single president]{.underline} since
this type of robust polling began, back to Franklin D. Roosevelt, [has
ever shown this level of consistency in approval ratings]{.underline}.
In fact, the next-smallest spread was 27%, for John F. Kennedy. [Trump's
approval ratings show that he has the strongest base in historical
times]{.underline}. 2020 by the numbers There are still nine months to
go until the first ballots will be cast in the race to the White House
for 2020, and the Democratic nominee's identity will most likely not be
known for almost a year. Still, Trump's chances of reelection are being
discussed daily. Trump's approval ratings are unlikely to go over 50%,
given his lackluster starting point. So what does he actually need to
win? A simple statistical model applied to recorded approval ratings
shows [Trump has been garnering higher and higher approval ratings since
taking office]{.underline}. Put simply, **[his base is staying strong
and even growing]{.underline}**. This is in direct contrast to all
presidents except Bill Clinton. Past incumbent presidents followed the
rule that 49% approval and above means winning reelection, and anything
below meant no second term. But Trump did not start at, nor will most
likely ever reach, that level of approval. Americans may again see
something that, statistically speaking, has never been seen before.
Approval ratings have high correlations with predicting the next
president, but with Trump, the numbers are outside any historical
trends. [The most unpopular winner ever may very likely win
again]{.underline}.

### Trump Wins -- A2 Polls

#### Polls aren't accurate and we're too far from the election to predict anything

**Daniel and Olson, 6/16**/2019 (Zoe, ABC's US bureau chief, Emily,
digital journalist based in the ABC\'s North American Bureau, "Donald
Trump could be in re-election trouble, the polls say. Here\'s why you
shouldn\'t believe them," ABC News,
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-06-14/donald-trump-did-the-us-learn-anything-from-2016-polls/11208412)

[Forgive my]{.underline} deeply felt [eye roll over
Washington\'s]{.underline} current infection of [Poll
Fever]{.underline}. Really? **[We\'re 16 months out from the 2020
election]{.underline}** folks, **[and after the polling debacle that was
2016, will we ever learn?]{.underline}** Apparently not. [Amid new polls
showing]{.underline} that Donald [Trump]{.underline} may be [in
re-election trouble]{.underline}, [there\'s]{.underline} already [been a
surge in Poll Fever]{.underline}. Symptoms include media chyrons
flickering with minute developments, campaign staffers spinning
desperate narratives, grown men in suits exchanging insults. [The horse
race narrative]{.underline} of Biden v Trump, Bernie v Trump, Warren v
Trump, Biden v Warren v Bernie v Harris v
everyone-else-on-the-endless-blue-ticket [is already
emerging]{.underline}. [Remember that US elections are almost entirely
personality rather than policy driven]{.underline}. There are few deep
political interviews. Thoughtful feature coverage of issues affecting
actual people is largely limited to the long-form pages of the print
media. [The cable news is so partisan that if you\'re watching your
chosen network, you will rarely see or hear a point of view that\'s
different from your own. Remember]{.underline} the 2016 presidential
election, [when a majority of the polls predicted]{.underline} Hillary
[Clinton achieving a sweeping victory]{.underline}? [Or]{.underline},
more recently, [the 2019 Australian election]{.underline}? When years of
polling led analysts to label the election \"unlosable\" for the Labor
party? In 2016, the polls went directly against everything I was seeing
when I was out reporting in the field --- that is, waves upon waves of
Trump supporters in the very states that would give him a path to
victory. But the polls! I thought I was going mad. It turns out the
polls were.

### Econ Outweighs

#### Econ thumps the election -- good markers outweigh the effect of the plan

**Schiller**, 6/4/**2019** (Brad, emeritus economics professor at
American University and author of *The Economy Today*, "How can Trump
get reelected? It's still the economy, stupid," LA Times,
https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-schiller-trump-economic-campaign-2020-20190604-story.html)

President [Trump isn't that worried about potential impeachment
hearings]{.underline}. He even tries to goad Democrats into starting the
process, knowing that will enliven his base and distract Democrats from
their legislative agenda. And he has emerged from the Mueller
investigation seemingly unscathed, despite serious evidence of
obstruction and unsavory behavior. The storm over Ms. Daniels has long
faded way, with only her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, facing criminal
charges. Like him or not, **[Trump has proven to be a "Teflon
president."]{.underline}** [As the 2020 election campaign gets underway,
Trump is exuding confidence]{.underline}. He boasts that he can beat any
of the potential challengers, including "Pocahontas," "sleepy Joe,"
"crazy Bernie," "lightweight Kirsten" and, of course, "crooked Hillary."
He predicts that his 2020 margin of victory will exceed that of 2016.
While Trump may taunt his potential challengers and boast of easy
victory, he surely harbors grave concerns about his reelection. He won
in 2016 on economic issues. His promise to "Make America Great Again"
reverberated with voters who had suffered through the worst
post-recession recovery in U.S. history. Now he faces a similar dilemma.
Yes, the economy is doing quite well and unemployment is at historic
lows --- as Trump constantly reminds us. But voters have short memories.
In November 2020 voters will be focused on contemporary economic
conditions. [An electoral prediction model]{.underline} constructed by
Yale University professor Ray Fair [highlights Trump's problem. The Fair
model says that people do vote their pocketbooks]{.underline} ("It's the
economy, stupid"). Further, their [votes can be predicted]{.underline}
[on the basis of]{.underline} only two pocketbook variables:
[g]{.underline}ross [d]{.underline}omestic [p]{.underline}roduct growth
[and inflation]{.underline}. History has shown that this simple model is
one of the best crystal balls for foreseeing the next election. It
correctly predicted Trump's 2016 win. Based on current economic trends,
**[the Fair model predicts a resounding victory for Trump in
2020]{.underline}**. But trends can reverse. The problem for Trump is
that voters won't be thinking about four years of economic performance
when they assess the economy in November 2020. They will be thinking
about conditions earlier in the year. If the economy grows well in the
first three quarters of an election year, the incumbent gets credit ---
and many more votes. Fair calculates that an incumbent president picks
up about two-thirds of a percentage point in the popular vote for every
one point of per capita GDP growth in the first three quarters of an
election year. But if growth declines or turns negative, the same
equation applies, except the president loses about two-thirds of a point
in the popular vote. A president who lost the popular vote in 2016 with
only a little more than 46% of the vote has to worry about such things.
Of course, electoral college math overcame Trump's second-place popular
vote. But that has happened only five times in U.S. history. Typically,
the winning candidate needs at least 50% of the popular vote to win.
Obama had 50.1% in 2012 and 52.9% in 2008. Bush had 50.7% in 2004. [At
present, the Fair model puts Trump comfortably]{.underline} above that
threshold, [with as much as 54% of the popular vote in 2020. Trump's
apparent margin of victory can be strengthened by a few more really good
quarters of economic growth]{.underline}. Specifically, for any calendar
quarter in which economic growth exceeds the long-term average of 3.2%,
the incumbent picks up an additional four-fifths of a point in the
popular vote. So far, Trump has enjoyed three such "good news" quarters.
They have added almost 2.4 points to his predicted vote share. Fair
predicts those good quarters all but assure a Trump victory in 2020.

### Immigration Thumper

#### Immigration crisis distracts voters -- overshadows the plan

**Drezner**, 06/05/**2019** (Daniel, professor of international politics
at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, "Trump
thinks immigration is a winning issue for 2020. Is he right?" Washington
Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/06/05/trump-thinks-immigration-is-winning-issue-is-he-right/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.178148cb2b35)

[I do wonder]{.underline}, however, [whether immigration might prove to
bolster Trump's support]{.underline}, thought not for the reason he
thinks. Fifteen years ago, during the 2004 campaign[, I suggested that
the deteriorating situation in Iraq perversely helped George W.
Bush]{.underline}: "Ordinarily, presidents are rewarded for doing their
jobs well. In Bush's case, however, [quiet in Iraq would allow Americans
to focus on their pocketbooks]{.underline}. \... The latest Gallup poll
shows a 54 percent disapproval rating on Bush's handling of the economy.
Bush's best hope for reelection is for the electorate to focus on his
leadership abilities --- and one way for that to happen is for there to
be trouble in Iraq." [The economy now is better than it was in 2004, but
that has not been reflected in Trump's approval numbers]{.underline}.
Instead, [people seem pretty dissatisfied with Trump]{.underline}'s
toddler-like style of leadership. **[One wonders]{.underline}**,
therefore, **[if the same dynamic will play out for Trump on
immigration]{.underline}**. Much like Bush with the Iraq War, [it is
hard to deny that Trump's approach to immigration has made the situation
worse]{.underline} on the southern border. [Nonetheless, there is also a
real crisis there, and **Americans believe immigration to be one of the
most important policy issues**]{.underline} facing the country. Unless
Democrats can proffer a coherent and credible plan about what to do on
the southern border, then Trump will be able to own this issue. [Trump
has precipitated the current immigration crisis. But he also claims that
he can fix it. Democrats seem reluctant to even discuss the issue. Until
that changes, **it is not insane for Trump to think of this topic as his
political security blanket.**]{.underline}

### Can't Predict

#### The election is too far away to predict

Stuart **Rothenberg** 1/3/**2019**, Roll Call, "An initial rating of the
2020 presidential race,"
https://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/an-initial-rating-of-the-2020-presidential-race

Obviously, some of those [factors will change over the next 22 months,
altering the two parties' prospects]{.underline} at least a few times
between now and Nov. 3, 2020. But you have to start somewhere. Watch:
2018 in 5 minutes --- the best of congressional Hits and Misses The
fundamentals Trump lost the popular vote by about 2.9 million votes
(just over 2 percentage points), but won the White House by carrying
states and districts that accounted for 306 electoral votes to Hillary
Clinton's 232. Narrow wins in three key Great Lakes states that often go
Democratic in presidential contests --- Pennsylvania (20 electoral
votes), Wisconsin (10) and Michigan (16) --- were crucial for him, as
were Florida (29), Arizona (11) and North Carolina (15), which he also
won narrowly. Clinton fell 38 electoral votes short of winning the
election. Democrats showed renewed strength last year in Pennsylvania,
Wisconsin and Michigan (including winning races for governor in all
three), which complicates Trump's re-election effort. Of course, Trump
narrowly lost four states he could conceivably carry in 2020 --- New
Hampshire (4), Minnesota (10), Nevada (6) and Maine (4), giving him at
least a couple of paths to 270 electoral votes next year. (He did
receive one of Maine's four votes in 2016 when he carried the state's
2nd District.) Most other states don't start off being in play in 2020,
although a handful (e.g., Colorado, Iowa, Virginia and even Georgia)
could be worth watching, if only to understand the dynamics of the
larger fight. Want insight more often? Get Roll Call in your inbox email
address In terms of his coalition, the good news for [Trump]{.underline}
is that he [has suffered relatively few defections since his
election]{.underline}. He remains [strong in rural America,
among]{.underline} [evangelicals]{.underline}, with
[non-college-educated white men]{.underline} and with
[conservatives]{.underline}. But the president has made no effort to
broaden his appeal, a reality very much in evidence in 2018 survey data
and in the midterm results. How little has Trump's coalition changed? He
won 46.1 percent of the vote in the 2016 presidential contest. Two years
later, his job approval in the exit poll stood at 45 percent, and
Republican House nominees drew 44.8 percent of the vote in midterm
balloting, according to data gathered by David Wasserman of the Cook
Political Report. Given the results of 2016 and 2018 (when Democratic
House candidates drew almost 10 million votes more than GOP nominees),
Trump again looks unlikely to win the popular vote next year. In that
case, the president's re-election map probably will need to resemble
2016's if he is going to win a second term. The midterms showed that
core Democratic constituencies that didn't vote for Clinton in 2016,
including younger voters, minorities and progressives, were back onboard
against Trump. In addition, white college-educated women (particularly
in the suburbs) moved toward the Democrats last year. If both of those
developments occur again, the president will have huge problems, which
is why Trump's single-minded focus on his base over the past two years
looks like a strategic error. The polls While initial 2020 polls should
be taken with a pound of salt, they illuminate the president's
vulnerabilities. The Dec. 9-12 NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showed
Trump trailing a "generic Democrat" by 14 points, 52 percent to 38
percent. Of course, [without a specific Democrat named]{.underline} in
the hypothetical ballot test, [the matchup is more of a referendum on
Trump]{.underline} than the choice of nominees that 2020 will be. [The
"generic ballot" test therefore]{.underline} may well [exaggerate the
president's weakness, since the eventual Democratic nominee is likely to
have liabilities]{.underline} that don't show up in any generic ballot.
In addition, [Democrats will have a]{.underline} potentially [nasty
primary fight]{.underline} in 2020, [which]{.underline} could easily
[produce a flawed nominee who, like Clinton, cannot unite anti-Trump
voters.]{.underline} And the eventual Democratic nominee may have to
tack so far left to win the nomination that swing voters will not be
comfortable supporting a progressive who calls for higher taxes and
Medicare for all (single-payer health care). It's wise to [be cautious
about early polls]{.underline}, since the president's numbers surely
will bounce around over the next year and a half. But his mediocre job
approval ratings and weak early standing in ballot tests are troubling
for GOP strategists. Events [There is no way of knowing what events will
draw America's attention]{.underline} 18 or 20 months from now, but
Republicans have reasons for concern. Trump clearly likes to keep
himself in the middle of things, and that inevitably leads to disruption
and chaos. That's not a problem for most of his base, of course, but it
could make the Democratic nominee more appealing to some voters who
supported Trump in 2016 but have tired of the circus. [The
economy]{.underline}, which has been strong during the first two years
of the Trump presidency, [looks]{.underline} increasingly
[vulnerable]{.underline} to higher interest rates, slower international
growth and the normal ups and downs of the business cycle. Most
economists expect slowing growth in the U.S. economy by later this year
and in early 2020, and while that doesn't necessarily mean a recession,
even slower growth could cause additional headaches for the president's
campaign. Administration turnover, Trump's leadership style, and
questions involving [trade/tariffs]{.underline}, China,
[Russia]{.underline}, NATO, the Middle East, the [budget deficit, health
care,]{.underline} immigration, [gun control]{.underline} and defense
could [all]{.underline} be [issues over the next couple of
years]{.underline}, keeping the president on the defensive. And [that
doesn't even include]{.underline} additional Trump problems stemming
from the special counsel [investigation by]{.underline} Robert S.
[Mueller]{.underline} III and House investigations into his business
dealings and administration's performance. Of course, House Democrats
could overplay their hand, giving Trump more and better options than he
has now and making themselves an issue rather than keeping the focus on
the president and his administration. But so far, the Democratic
leadership seems to understand the risks to impeachment. The bottom line
Both parties face significant challenges. The president has alienated
too many voters for his own good, limiting his appeal and forcing him to
negotiate a narrow path toward a re-election that looks more difficult
after Democratic victories in the midterms. Democrats, on the other
hand, face turnout and persuasion challenges as they seek a nominee who
can both rally the party's base and appeal to swing voters, some of whom
find the party's progressive agenda no more palatable than Trump's
performance in office. The president is not the political basket case
that some portray him. Barack Obama won a second term even after a
disastrous first midterm election, and Trump's base remains largely
intact. Moreover, [the electoral college narrowly favors the
GOP.]{.underline} Given all of these considerations, 2020 starts off as
a competitive contest, though not a pure toss-up. [There are too many
questions surrounding the president's re-election prospects to call the
race]{.underline} even, and there are [too many opportunities for the
Democrats to blunder]{.underline} toward a weak general election nominee
to rate the race Leans Democratic.

### Aff -- Link Turn

#### Arms sales are the key to the election -- plan tanks trump

**Exum, 2017** (Andrew, contributing editor at The Atlantic. From 2015
to 2016, he was the U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for
Middle East policy; "What Progressives Miss About Arms Sales," The
Atlantic,
https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/americas-right-to-sell-arms/527805/)

Whew! For once, one of my predictions was correct: Donald Trump had a
great visit to Saudi Arabia. It was a great visit for him, it was a
great visit for the Saudis and the other Arab Gulf states, and---last
but not least---it was a great visit for magical, glowing orbs. I want
to spend a little time talking about one of the reasons why the trip
went so well. I'll warn you: This is a somewhat taboo subject for
progressive foreign-policy types. The subject, friends, is arms sales.
Progressives don't like **[arms sales]{.underline}** very much, but they
need to pay attention to them, because they're **[\[are\]
one]{.underline}** big **[way Republicans are fighting for---and
winning---the votes of working-class Americans who have traditionally
voted for Democrats]{.underline}**. While the president was in Saudi
Arabia, [the Trump administration announced \$110 billion in arms sales
to Saudi Arabia]{.underline}---with an additional \$240 billion
committed over a 10-year period. If you've ever worked in government,
you know this is what is called a "deliverable," the clunky
management-consultantese term for a tangible outcome of a visit or
meeting. When Donald Trump is asked to justify his trip to Saudi Arabia,
he'll cite that \$110 billion in arms sales. There are a few interesting
things about these sales. The first is that many of these sales were
already in the works. The Obama administration spent eight years quietly
selling a lot of arms to Saudi Arabia: When President Obama left office,
for example, the United States still had \$100 billion in the foreign
military sales pipeline with Saudi Arabia and, in 2011, had inked what
was previously the largest arms sale in U.S. history with the
Kingdom---a \$29 billion deal to sell F-15s to the Saudis. Obama-era
sales to Saudi Arabia were in keeping with sales to other Gulf states:
Both Qatar and the United Arab Emirates bought a tremendous amount of
U.S. arms between 2009 and 2017. Qatar bought more U.S. arms than any
other state in 2014 and, in the waning days of the Obama administration,
announced that it would buy nearly \$4 billion in Boeing-made F-15s in
addition to \$19 billion in commercial aircraft, also from Boeing.
Overall, the Arab Gulf states went on a spending spree during the Obama
years, and most of the money was spent on American arms. So why didn't
you hear a lot about this from Democratic politicians during the 2016
election season? There are two main reasons---one strategic and one
moral. Strategically, not everyone is convinced that arming the Arab
Gulf states to the teeth is a wise idea. Some worry that these arms
might someday endanger Israel's security, while others worry the Arab
Gulf states might be encouraged to use their new toys on disastrous
military interventions against Iran or Iranian proxies in, say, Yemen.
The quick and unsatisfying answer to these concerns is the global
market. The Arab Gulf states have money, and that money will buy the
weapons that are available. If U.S. arms are not for sale, fine: French,
Chinese, or Russian arms will be. (And if you don't believe me, look at
the way in which Gulf states---frustrated by U.S. export controls on
drone technology---are turning to the Chinese.) Selling U.S. arms to the
Gulf states, by contrast, further ties them to U.S. interests by
deepening cooperation and interoperability between the U.S. military and
its Gulf partners. One of the reasons Qatar wanted to buy U.S. fighters
to partially replace its French-made fleet, for example, was because
they discovered how difficult it was for their existing fighter aircraft
to fly with the U.S. air force as part of coalitions over Libya and
Syria. [Arms sales also drive down the cost of our own weapons and thus
the amount of money U.S. tax-payers have to spend on defense instead of
other priorities]{.underline} like, say, the State Department, school
lunches, or housing subsidies. Here's one example: Because the United
States is buying fewer F-35s than originally planned and using more of
its "fourth generation" fighters (F-15s, F-16s, etc.) in the skies over
Iraq and Syria than previously anticipated, the Department of Defense
will likely need to buy more of those fourth generation fighters in the
coming years. The recent sales of F-15s to Qatar, F-18s to Kuwait, and
F-16s to Bahrain will drive down the cost per plane for the Pentagon.
That's a good thing---at least financially. Morally, though, many
progressives just grow ill at the idea of selling weapons abroad.
Senator Chris Murphy, for example---one of the more eloquent and
consistent critics of U.S. arms sales in the Senate, even though his own
state has a very robust defense industrial base---sees nothing admirable
about the idea of selling weapons to the Saudis that might be used in
Yemen. Other progressives agree: Yes, they argue, we understand the
demand of the market will be met by someone, but do we have to be
complicit in providing the supply? In other countries, progressives have
even taken to the courts in an effort to halt sales. [I have a lot of
respect for]{.underline} these [progressive]{.underline}s and their
[values]{.underline}. [I]{.underline} spent too much time in Sunday
School as a kid to not [feel a little uneasy]{.underline} about the
business of selling weapons. And the angst many progressives feel [about
U.S. arms sales]{.underline} has been enough to keep many Democrats from
talking up their successes in helping U.S. industry abroad[. **I
wonder**]{.underline}, though, **[if there isn't a real political
cost]{.underline}** to not doing so. [Boeing employs 157,000
people]{.underline}---almost all of them in the United States. 14,500
people work in [Boeing's facilities in Missouri]{.underline}, where the
F-15 and F-18 are made, where Senator Claire McCaskill is up for
reelection next year, and [where Donald Trump trounced Hillary Clinton
56 to 38 percent in 2016]{.underline}. (Those 14,500 people do not
include the many thousands of other Americans who make parts for the
F-15 and F-18 elsewhere in America.) [Lockheed Martin]{.underline},
meanwhile, a huge winner in the recent arms deal with Saudi Arabia
(despite ace businessman Jared Kushner negotiating the price down on
behalf of the Saudis), [employs an additional 97,000
workers]{.underline}---again, most of them in the United States. And
[Raytheon]{.underline}, another big winner last week, [employs another
60,000 or so Americans]{.underline}. Donald Trump obviously has no moral
qualms about selling weapons to our partners and allies abroad. And so
[while Democrats leave points on the board with working-class voters by
not talking about how much Democrats do to support U.S.
industry]{.underline}, **[Republicans swoop in to take
credit]{.underline}** with assembly line workers for even those things
that Obama approved and set in motion. [The way in which Trump brags
about U.S. arms sales]{.underline}, of course, is in keeping with the
strain of economic mercantilism that ran through his populist campaign
message. That message [worked with voters throughout the
Midwest,]{.underline} **[helping to cost Clinton the
election]{.underline}**. So while progressives might have moral qualms
about companies that sell weapons, [the roughly 1.2 million American
voters who work in the aerospace and defense
sector]{.underline}---together with the roughly 3.2 million Americans
who support the sector indirectly---[see little wrong with the
sales]{.underline} that help ensure their livelihoods and provide a
future for their children. [This might be another area in which
progressive elites]{.underline}---who have the kinds of education and
skills that don't require them to seek work on the assembly line---[are
simply out of touch with the voters]{.underline} they need to win back
control of the Congress and state assemblies, never mind the presidency.
And politics aside, surely even the moral calculus of arms sales gets
more complicated when you think about the millions of American mouths
that are fed by mothers and fathers who work in the aerospace and
defense sector. Donald **[Trump]{.underline}**, for his part, **[is
speaking to those voters]{.underline}**. And even as progressives fret
about U.S. arms sales, they should also fret about what it will mean for
the rest of their agenda when Republicans claim credit for protecting
some of the last good assembly-line jobs in America.

### Climate Change

#### Extinction requires 12 degrees which Paris can't solve but provides time for adaption and other countries to solve 

Sebastian **Farquhar 17**, master's degree in Physics from the
University of Oxford, leads the Global Priorities Project (GPP) at the
Centre for Effective Altruism, et al., 2017, "Existential Risk:
Diplomacy and Governance,"
https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Existential-Risks-2017-01-23.pdf

[**The most likely levels of global warming are very unlikely to cause
human extinction**.15 The existential risks of climate change instead
stem from tail risk climate change -- the low probability of extreme
levels of warming -- and interaction with other sources of
risk]{.underline}. It is impossible to say with confidence at what point
global warming would become severe enough to pose an existential threat.
[Research has suggested that warming of 11-12°C would render most of the
planet uninhabitable,]{.underline}16 and would completely devastate
agriculture.17 This would pose an extreme threat to human civilisation
as we know it.18 Warming of around 7°C or more could potentially produce
conflict and instability on such a scale that the indirect effects could
be an existential risk, although it is extremely uncertain how likely
such scenarios are.19 **[Moreover, the timescales over which such
changes might happen could mean that humanity is able to adapt enough to
avoid extinction in even very extreme scenarios.]{.underline}** The
probability of these levels of warming depends on eventual greenhouse
gas concentrations. According to some experts, unless strong action is
taken soon by major emitters, it is likely that we will pursue a
medium-high emissions pathway.20 If we do, the chance of extreme warming
is highly uncertain but appears non-negligible. Current concentrations
of greenhouse gases are higher than they have been for hundreds of
thousands of years,21 which means that there are significant unknown
unknowns about how the climate system will respond. Particularly
concerning is the risk of positive feedback loops, such as the release
of vast amounts of methane from melting of the arctic permafrost, which
would cause rapid and disastrous warming.22 [The economists Gernot
Wagner and Martin Weitzman have used IPCC figures (which do not include
modelling of feedback loops such as those from melting permafrost) to
estimate that if we continue to pursue a medium-high emissions pathway,
the probability of eventual warming of 6°C is around 10%,23 and of 10°C
is around 3%.24 **These estimates are of course highly uncertain**. It
is likely that the world will take action against climate change once it
begins to impose large costs on human society, **long before** there is
warming of 10**°C**]{.underline}. Unfortunately, there is significant
inertia in the climate system: there is a 25 to 50 year lag between CO2
emissions and eventual warming,25 and it is expected that 40% of the
peak concentration of CO2 will remain in the atmosphere 1,000 years
after the peak is reached.26 Consequently, it is impossible to reduce
temperatures quickly by reducing CO2 emissions. If the world does start
to face costly warming, the international community will therefore face
strong incentives to find other ways to reduce global temperatures.

### Accidental War

#### Trump cant unilaterally go to war -- even when provoking other countries, wont escalate 

Peter **Feaver**, 11-17-**2017**, (professor of political science and
public policy and Bass Fellow at Duke University, and director of the
Triangle Institute for Security Studies and the Duke Program in American

HBJ

[It is a different matter in the other context: when it is the president
who wakes up the military and tries to get them to go from peacetime to
war]{.underline}, [i.e. to launch a preventive nuclear
attack.]{.underline} In the preventive case**[, it is not reasonable to
believe that the streamlined procedures of an emergency response would
operate without anyone raising objections]{.underline}**. [The steps the
president would have to take in order to pass a nuclear order to someone
who could physically launch the missiles would simultaneously alert the
rest of his national security team]{.underline}. **[Efforts to bypass
the senior leadership would themselves further alarm subordinates,
increasing the likelihood that they would draw in the rest of the
national security team,]{.underline}** even if ordered not to. **[The
military is trained to reject illegal orders and the president trying to
order the military to go from peacetime to nuclear war without
consulting with his national security advisors would set off alarms up
and down the system]{.underline}** about whether the orders were legal.
[The president does not need anyone else to help him fire off a tweet,
**but he does need many others to help him fire off a
nuclear**]{.underline} intercontinental ballistic
**[missile]{.underline}**. If he were trying to do so it would take an
enormous effort of persuasion that would involve many more people than
are involved in the streamlined, launch-under-attack scenario. What
would happen in this second scenario? That question led to the second
major topic of concern in the Q&A period: how robust is the military
training to resist illegal orders and how confident could we be that the
Pentagon would view an order to "launch a preventive nuclear war without
notifying my national security team" to be illegal? In testimony,
General **[Kehler repeatedly emphasized that the military does not
follow orders blindly \[sic\] and the ubiquity of lawyers at multiple
layers of command gives us high confidence the legal questions would be
asked]{.underline}** (and need to be answered) **[before a nuclear
strike actually happened.]{.underline}** This is true, though it is also
true that the military are trained that authenticated orders from the
national command authority have a presumption of legality. (Note: the
presumption is even stronger in launch-under-attack scenarios, because
the United States has long embraced the legal concept of anticipatory
self-defense, which could result in a decision to strike under
circumstances where the United States has not yet suffered an attack,
but one is deemed to be imminent or even underway.) Nevertheless, I am
inclined to share General Kehler's confidence that **[a rogue president
would find it exceedingly hard to persuade the military to
act]{.underline}** in preventive war scenarios as rapidly as they are
trained to act in launch-under-attack scenarios. [Part of this comes
from my understanding of the civil-military context of national
security.]{.underline} [Presidents already find it challenging to
persuade the military to embrace policies that the military object
to]{.underline} --- [and which are far less consequential than
preventive nuclear war]{.underline}. Another of my books, Armed
Servants, explores in some detail the push and shove of civil-military
relations. And still a third (co-authored with Chris Gelpi), Choosing
Your Battles, shows that **[the military are hardly chomping at the bit
to initiate the use of force]{.underline}**. To be sure, I also found,
in Guarding the Guardians, that the military did favor a system inclined
to the always rather than the never side of the always/never dilemma.
This is in part why U.S. political leaders insisted that there be
civilian control of the arsenal. Yet all of these policies were the
result of a lengthy bureaucratic struggle that involved many more people
than just the president and the few nuclear operators required to launch
a missile.

### Economy

#### The impact is globally inevitable --- trade, consumer spending, manufacturing, political fights, and bad investments

George **Pickering** 4/3/**2019**, 2018 Mises Institute Research Fellow
and a student of economic history at the London School of Economics,
"It\'s Not a Recession, It\'s a \"Global Economic Slowdown\","
<https://mises.org/wire/its-not-recession-its-global-economic-slowdown>
\<APY-G\>

However, it is no coincidence that [predictions of a more pronounced
slowdown have been on the rise over the past few months, given the
noticeable stuttering of the global economy since the end of 2018. Even
in the U.S. economy, consumer spending]{.underline} in December 2018
[exhibited its greatest drop]{.underline} since 2009, with personal
income falling for the first time in three years in January, and factory
activity hitting a two-year low in February. All of this contributed to
a predicted annual growth rate of just 0.5% for the first quarter of
2019, and a flatlining dollar since the end of 2018. [The outlook is
even worse outside the relative oasis of prosperity that is the
U.S.]{.underline} economy at present. Both [Britain and the
Eurozone]{.underline} grew by just 0.2% in the final quarter of 2018,
Italy has [entered its fifth recession]{.underline} in two decades, and
[recent]{.underline} news of a major [German]{.underline} manufacturing
[slump suggests more dark clouds on the horizon]{.underline} for the
European economy. In light of this dismal backdrop, it is easy to
understand how economic analysts have so easily slipped into their
current predictions of a significant worldwide slowdown for the
remainder of 2019. So [what]{.underline} has [caused this worldwide
weakening of growth]{.underline}, which so many are expecting to develop
into a global economic slowdown? Most pundits have painted the situation
as something of [a perfect storm]{.underline}, with numerous factors
from different regions having combined in a manner likely to produce a
worldwide impact. The [Chinese]{.underline} economic
[slowdown]{.underline} has been one of the most talked-about of these
factors, especially after Beijing's announcement that it will be cutting
its growth forecast for the rest of the year, down to between 6% and
6.5%, compared with last year's official figure of 6.6%. Chinese
[exports have]{.underline} also [taken a significant hit]{.underline}
since the beginning of the year, with February's export figures
suggesting a 20.7% decline compared with the same month last year,
doubtless due in part to the ongoing tariff war between China and the
US. The [weakness of]{.underline} the [Europe]{.underline}an economy,
[mired]{.underline} as it is [in the uncertainty surrounding Brexit
amongst other factors, has]{.underline} also [been cited as a millstone
around the neck of the global economy]{.underline}. However, the media
focus on [these individual symptoms risks drawing attention away from
the]{.underline} slowdown's [underlying systemic cause: the past decade
of artificially low interest rates]{.underline}. In the aftermath of the
global financial crisis of 2007/8, central banks around the world
responded by implementing near-zero interest rate policies, which they
then maintained for an unprecedented length of time as the slump dragged
on. In response to the tentative recovery of the past two or so years,
however, numerous key central banks have begun the gradual process of
normalizing interest rates once again. As Ludwig von Mises explained
with his Austrian Business Cycle Theory, [such an extended
period]{.underline} of artificially low interest rates will have
[induced businesses into a myriad of 'malinvestments': risky, long-term
projects which only appear profitable for as long as the unsustainably
low interest rates persist]{.underline}. When the risk of runaway
inflation eventually forces central banks to raise interest rates again,
the new, higher cost of borrowing reveals that many of these projects
cannot be completed profitably, forcing businesses to either
significantly scale back their activities or face heavy losses, or both.
[The timing of this]{.underline} current [stutter]{.underline} in the
global economy certainly seems to [support the view that]{.underline},
in line with Mises' theory, [recent interest rate hikes have begun
revealing the unsteady foundations on which the past few years' recovery
has been built]{.underline}. Sensing this, central banks around the
world have been following the Fed's dovish turn since January,
reconsidering or outright reversing their previously planned interest
rate hikes. However, such [attempts to delay the inevitable]{.underline}
readjustment can [only result in even greater]{.underline} numbers of
[malinvestments]{.underline} being made in the meantime, [with the
result being that when]{.underline} the [correction finally does arrive,
a mere \"global economic slowdown\" may be the least of our
worries.]{.underline}

#### Economic downturns don't cause conflict\-\--stats prove

[Do **economic downturn**s generate pressure for diversionary

economizing behavior in foreign policy? [This paper provides new
evidence that economic stress is associated with **conciliatory policies
between strategic rivals.**]{.underline} For states that view each other
as military threats, the biggest step possible toward bilateral
cooperation is to terminate the rivalry by taking political steps to
manage the competition. [Drawing on data from **109 distinct rival
dyads** since 1950, **67 of which terminated,** the evidence suggests
rivalries were approximately **twice as likely to terminate during
economic downturns**]{.underline} than they were during periods of
economic normalcy. [This is true controlling for **all of the main

Introduction [Since the]{.underline} invention and [first use of nuclear
weapons]{.underline} in 1945, [predictions]{.underline} [on]{.underline}
the [proliferation]{.underline} of these weapons [have]{.underline}
traditionally [been]{.underline} **[overestimating]{.underline}**.1
[Despite]{.underline} all [gloomy forecasts, only nine
states]{.underline} [now]{.underline}adays are considered to [possess
nuclear weapons]{.underline}: the United States, Russia, China, the
United Kingdom, France, Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea.
Although more states have operated nuclear weapons programmes at some
point in the past 65 years -- some experts argue that in total 39 states
once engaged in nuclear weapons activities2 -- [most]{.underline} of
them sooner or [later **gave up**]{.underline} their
**[ambition]{.underline}** to acquire these weapons. Especially since
the second half of the 1980s the number of states with nuclear
weapons-related activities has become relatively low.3 Taking into
account the historical trends, [it looks like political and academic
forecasts even nowadays tend to be **overemphasizing the risks of
further proliferation**]{.underline} of nuclear weapons [**in the near
future**, for example by **predicting nuclear domino
effects**]{.underline} if new nuclear weapons powers would arise and
cause other states to develop nuclear weapons as well.4 [The
difficulties in forecasting nuclear weapons proliferation can be
explained by one key factor]{.underline}: [it is]{.underline} still
**[unclear among academics and policymakers]{.underline}**
[why]{.underline} exactly [states]{.underline} [start nuclear weapons
programmes or refrain from them. What makes nuclear weapons]{.underline}
**[attractive or unattractive]{.underline}** to the leadership of any
state? True, [many theories exist]{.underline}. The problem with
[all]{.underline} existing theories on motivations for states to acquire
or not to acquire nuclear weapons is that [\[have\] supporting
evidence]{.underline} may be found, [but opposing evidence as
well]{.underline}. When studying nuclear weapons (non-)proliferation,
one could consider any state in the world as an individual case, each
with its own international and domestic circumstances, and with all the
changes herein during history. It is, therefore, not surprising that
[specific explanations]{.underline} of nuclear behaviour
[are]{.underline} **[repeatedly]{.underline}** considered
**[inadequate]{.underline}** because they fail to account for all cases
-- currently more than 190 states. Without understanding what are the
motivations of states to aim for or refrain from acquiring nuclear
weapons, it is not only complicated to forecast nuclear proliferation
dynamics, but even more important: it becomes difficult to develop
policies aimed at influencing these dynamics -- there is a risk of
treating the symptoms while ignoring the disease. This article aims at
contributing to answering this key question in the field of nuclear
weapons proliferation: why do states wish for nuclear weapons -- or not?
This will not be achieved by developing a new theory, but by increasing
the insights in the large amount of existing theories on nuclear
proliferation motivations. For this purpose the many theories developed
in the past decades will be grouped into four overarching groups. This
analysis could be helpful to future researchers and policy makers who
got lost in the current richness in theories and their critics. Grouping
existing theories on nuclear (non-)proliferation motivations has, to a
limited extent, been done before. Considering the general lack of
unanimity in this research field, it is not surprising that these
groupings also differ. To give some examples: a rather early study on
proliferation motives by George Quester, dating from 1973, counted three
groups of them: 1) military motives; 2) political motives; and 3)
economic motives.5 Scott Sagan in 1996 also developed a grouping of
three 'models' explaining why states wish to build nuclear weapons: 1)
security; 2) domestic politics; and 3) norms.6 Assembling
(non-)proliferation into four groups is also possible, as study from
2010 by William Potter and Gaukhar Mukhatzhanova, shows. Summarized,
Potter and Mukhatzhanova group all theories on nuclear weapons
(non-)proliferation motivations into these four categories: 1) security;
2) international institutions; 3) international norms; and 4) domestic
circumstances.7 Etel Solingen some years earlier (2007) defined the same
four groups, but also added a fifth one: democracy versus autocracy.8
And to mention only one more possible classification: Joseph Cirincione
in 2007 also defined five motivations for states to pursue or forgo
nuclear weapons: 1) security; 2) prestige; 3) domestic politics; 4)
technology; and 5) economics.9 These are just some examples to show that
not only the amount of theoretical groups differs, but also their
content. Nevertheless, some similarities can be noticed; although not
every author mentions the same motivational factor theories, some
overlap can obviously be noticed. This article groups the existing
theories on motivations for nuclear weapons (non- )acquisition in four
factors: 1) Capabilities; 2) Security; 3) International Norms &
Perceptions; and 4) Domestic Political Context. The article will discuss
what they incorporate (including criticism) and why is chosen to group
them in this manner. In conclusion some implications and recommendations
for further research regarding nuclear (non-)proliferation dynamics will
be presented. Capabilities The first group of incentives and
disincentives for nuclear weapons (non-) proliferation is summarized
here as 'capabilities'. Under this umbrella are brought together both
the technological and economic capabilities of states to develop nuclear
weapons. [Nuclear weapons are]{.underline} [**not easy to develop**, nor
are the materials that are required cheap and commonly available.
Technologically and scientifically]{.underline} the [most
challenging]{.underline} and costly [is the production of fissile
materials]{.underline} (highly enriched uranium or plutonium).
[Transforming]{.underline} the nuclear [materials into]{.underline}
**[reliable and deliverable weapons]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}
**[another challenge]{.underline}** [that requires **highly
advanced**]{.underline} technological **[expertise]{.underline}**, and
[the same]{.underline} applies [to]{.underline} developing the [delivery
systems]{.underline} for the weapons -- in this regard, nowadays states
generally prefer ballistic missiles.10 It is often argued that [the
technological and financial capabilities required]{.underline} for
developing nuclear weapons [are an]{.underline} **[effective
barrier]{.underline}** [especially to]{.underline} **[less developed
countries]{.underline}** without an advanced scientific and
technological infrastructure and without the financial strength to
afford the investments needed to start a nuclear weapons programme.11
Since Pakistan and North Korea -- both relatively poor countries --
acquired nuclear weapons in 1998 respectively 2006, this argument has
generally faded away from the debate. Actually, the theoretical
assumption that capabilities influence the motivation of states to
pursue or forgo nuclear weapons, is fading away itself from the academic
debate since, approximately, the early 1990s. The capabilities theory is
dating back from the first decades of academic research into nuclear
motivations and gradually became less popular. In the first decades of
nuclear weapons existence, it was generally assumed that any state would
like to have nuclear weapons, simply because these weapons were the most
advanced and powerful military tools available. Stephen Meyer in 1984
summarized the consequences of this assumption as follows: 'If one
presumes that the incentives to acquire nuclear weapons are ever present
-- that all countries would like to have nuclear weapons -- then the
only determining factor becomes technology.'12 One could also describe
the capabilities motivation as a 'why not' principle. When a state has
the means available to build nuclear weapons, why should it refrain?
When it is, for example, rather easy to convert civilian nuclear
technology programmes into military ones, the costs of nuclear weapons
may become relatively low enough that the perceived benefits --
obtaining the most powerful weapons that exist -- easily outweigh the
negative consequences.13 Proponents of the capabilities theory regularly
claim that scientists often play a crucial role in this process. Ralph
Lapp, for example, in 1970 argued that 'research and development has
become an almost unchallenged force in directing the nation to arms. We
may speak of this as technological determinism.'14 Hans Bethe in 1985
also pointed at 'the technological imperative' with regard to nuclear
weapons development, mentioning the feeling among scientists and
government officials 'that we must use this new technology'.15 In this
respect, often an encompassing quotation of Robert Oppenheimer, one of
the founders of the nuclear weapons programme of the United States, is
presented about developing the hydrogen bomb (an improved kind of
nuclear bomb): 'When I saw how to do it, it was clear to me that one had
to at least make the thing. \[\...\] The program in 1951 \[to develop
the H-bomb\] was technically so sweet that you could not argue about
that.'16 The main evidence that the capabilities theory is not
explaining nuclear weapons (non-)proliferation adequately is the fact
that many countries have become technologically and economically able to
develop nuclear weapons, but never did so. The technological 'pull
factor' leading to a wish for nuclear weapons often seems nonexistent,
at least not autonomously. These last two words, 'not autonomously', are
important, because it may be assumed that the capabilities factor is
still important in determining motivations to pursue or forgo nuclear
weapons, even though it may not be a decisive factor on its own. In
certain circumstances, the availability of capabilities to develop
nuclear weapons may compel the leadership of a state to start a nuclear
weapons programme even if it would not have done so when these
capabilities were not available. On the other hand, a [lack of
tech]{.underline}nological [and / or econ]{.underline}omical means [may
force state leaders with a wish for nuclear]{.underline} weapons
[to]{.underline} **[abstain from]{.underline}** starting
**[a]{.underline}** nuclear weapons **[programme]{.underline}** --
although this is still a choice with its own motivations, because it
could always be a possibility to start acquiring the capabilities
needed, even when this requires tough choices on how to spend limited
state budgets.17 In this regard, the [capabilities]{.underline} to
acquire nuclear weapons [may]{.underline} perhaps [be]{.underline}
considered a [necessary, but]{.underline} at itself
[insufficient]{.underline} cause [for]{.underline} nuclear weapons
[prolif]{.underline}eration.18 Even today, there is no unanimity among
scholars on the influence of capabilities on nuclear (non-)proliferation
behaviour by states. A striking example of this lack of unanimity can be
found in one and the same recent book: in an edited volume on nuclear
forecasting, dating from 2010, two contributions come to opposite
conclusions on the capabilities factor. A chapter by Harald Müller and
Andreas Schmidt concludes that the hypothesis that nuclear weapons
proliferation is capability driven ('capability may be defined in
economic or technological terms') cannot be validated at all. The
authors state: '\[\...\] economic factors are almost completely
irrelevant for the initiation of nuclear weapons activities. Rather, it
is a question of political willingness to devote a considerable share of
state's resources to the military sector instead of, say, strengthening
the public welfare program.' And the same applies to technology, they
contend: 'There is no indication at all of a technological pull.'19 In
the same volume, however, Philipp Bleek comes to the complete opposite
conclusion: 'Economic resources and technical capabilities are
powerfully correlated with proliferation proclivity at all levels. More
highly developed states, with access to commensurately greater resources
and technical capabilities, are more likely to explore nuclear weapons
options, launch nuclear weapons programs, and acquire nuclear weapons.
Given how costly and technically challenging nuclear weapons development
is, this is perhaps not a surprising finding; some might even brand it a
resounding reinforcement of conventional wisdom. But it provides robust
evidence to counter those who argue, often citing relatively undeveloped
countries like China and Pakistan that nonetheless proliferated, that
countries' level of development has little to do with their
proliferation proclivity. More highly developed countries proliferate
more readily; less highly developed countries do so less readily.'20
Security The traditionally dominant theory on motivations for states to
pursue nuclear weapons or not has been focussing on security. Since the
beginning of research on dynamics of nuclear (non-)proliferation this
has been by far the most supported factor explaining why states opt for
nuclear weapons. The so-called 'realist' school of thinking -- in the
academic domain of International Relations (IR) in general, but also in
the subfield of (non-)proliferation studies -- considers the world as an
anarchy. In this anarchy, states are in continuous competition and will
only be able to survive as an independent state by 'self-help', which
can be summarized as individualistic behaviour, aiming for its own power
and benefits and thus strengthening its position in comparison with
other states. Following this theory, nuclear weapons are considered to
be the ultimate tool for survival, because these powerful weapons will
provide the best security guarantee against any external aggression. Any
adversary state will think twice before it will attempt to harm the
state in question in any way, because this may ultimately result in the
nuclear destruction of this adversary itself. The only condition for
having a successful nuclear deterrent is that the nuclear weapons
arsenal should be so capacious that it cannot be totally destroyed by a
surprise attack.21 When this realist theory is strictly applied, the
conclusion should be that actually all states wish for nuclear weapons
to be able to ensure their survival within the current international
anarchic system. This may, in the end, be the case, but [most realist
thinkers agree that developing]{.underline} nuclear [weapons is not
easy, cheap or without risk]{.underline}. This has culminated into a
broadly supported nuance of the theory, acknowledging that [only states
with **actual, pressing**]{.underline} **[security
problems]{.underline}** [will]{.underline} actively [pursue nuclear
weapons]{.underline}.22 Especially the risk calculation factor is often
used to explain why most states so far did not develop nuclear weapons.
This explanation is necessary to defend the theory against its critics
who state that [the realist view cannot explain why **so few states**
did actually obtain nuclear weapons]{.underline}, [considering
that]{.underline} ultimately [all states would want to]{.underline} have
them and many of the non-acquiring states have been, or still are,
facing obvious security problems. Realist thinkers generally refute this
critique by arguing that [it is not]{.underline} being [claimed
that]{.underline} [acquisition of nuclear weapons is always the best way
to improve]{.underline} a state's [security]{.underline}. [Sometimes
acquiring nuclear weapons may be a **bigger threat**]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} a state's [security]{.underline} then to forgo them,
[because a]{.underline} nuclear weapons [programme may cause more
distrust and tension among (potential) adversaries]{.underline} than
would be the case without a nuclear weapons programme. An adversary
state may feel so threatened by the nuclear weapons programme that it
will launch a military attack to prevent its adversary from acquiring
them. Even more, the adversary state may react by developing nuclear
weapons itself, thus creating a nuclear arms race and causing even more
insecurity and instability in the region. When this may be expected,
realists claim, states often refrain from starting a nuclear weapons
programme.23 T.V. Paul labels this 'prudential realism'. In his words,
this is a 'soft realist version' acknowledging that 'nations under
certain circumstances may prudently forgo military capabilities that
other states see as threatening. \[\...\] States are security-conscious
entities, but their military policies are driven by 'most probable
threat' assessments, as opposed to the worst-case assessments offered by
hard realism.'24 Moreover, some more nuanced realist approaches also try
to explain the small percentage of states actually aiming for nuclear
weapons by adding levels of insecurity into the theory. From this point
of view, states that are involved in an intense and / or longstanding
conflict will aim for nuclear weapons more easily then states within a
lowintensity conflict and / or a relatively short period of
insecurity.25 On the other hand, many examples can be found of states in
intense conflict situations that never started a nuclear weapons
programme. This, in turn, may be explained by an important variant of
the realist school of thinking, which emphasizes the importance of
security alliances. This variant has been one of the most supported
theories for explaining nuclear (non-)proliferation during the Cold War
-- and even up to now many analysts favour the alliance explanation to
account for nuclear (non-)proliferation dynamics. Instead of developing
nuclear weapons to assure their security, proponents of this theory
argue, states may also choose another option: seeking for an alliance
with a nuclear weapons state that is willing to promise nuclear
retaliation in case the nonnuclear ally will be (nuclear) attacked. This
kind of security guarantee, often called a 'nuclear umbrella' or
'positive security assurance' makes a national nuclear weapons programme
less necessary and the costs, difficulties, and risks associated with it
can be avoided. The promise of retaliation by the nuclear armed ally
functions as extended deterrence towards possible enemies.26 Critics of
this alliance theory question the credibility of these extended
deterrence guarantees. Extended deterrence may be more or less credible
when it functions as deterrence against (overwhelming) conventional
military threats, but would any nuclear weapons state risk nuclear
warfare because of assisting a non-nuclear ally after an attack by
another nuclear weapons state?27 Joseph Cirincione summarizes this
credibility problem as follows: 'National leaders will continue to ask
themselves: 'Would the President of the United States risk Washington to
protect my capital city?''28 Moreover, the reliance on nuclear-armed
allies seems to contradict the base realist assumption of self-reliance.
Jacques Hymans formulates this contradiction in this way: 'At the very
core of realism lies the notion that friends today may become enemies
tomorrow. \[\...\] Thus, the dominant strategy of states is to go for
the bomb themselves and thus avoid any pleasant surprises.'29 The
so-called Neo-realist theory, developed since the 1970s, combines the
importance of security guarantees with the dimension of the
international system: whether this system is unipolar, bipolar, or
multipolar will influence the value of security guarantees. In a bipolar
world like the Cold War era, neo-realists claim, security guarantees by
one of the two superpowers will generally solve any security concern of
other states. In a multipolar world, which arose after the end of the
Cold War, the stabilizing role of security guarantees by superpowers is
loosened because these superpowers themselves have become relatively
less powerful.30 In a multipolar world states tend to start their own
nuclear weapons programme more easily. Neo-realists nowadays have to
admit, however, that the number of newly started nuclear programmes
after the end of the Cold War has not been that impressive. Another
rather modern realist way to defend the security motivation as principal
factor explaining nuclear (non-)proliferation against its critics, has
been the 'opaque proliferation' discussion.31 Especially since the 1990s
the concept of 'opacity', 'latency', or 'ambiguity' has become more
popular in nuclear proliferation studies. Especially realist thinkers
turn around the argument that many states are able to build nuclear
weapons, but never did so. They contend that several of these nuclear
weapons capable states did, indeed, never develop nuclear weapons up to
their final stage -- in the end resulting in testing them -- but that
they in fact developed nuclear weapons without testing them, or at least
developed the means to be able to build nuclear weapons in a very short
timeframe. This is also called 'threshold capacity' -- it takes little
time to pass the threshold of nuclear weapons possession. This way,
there are more nuclear weapons states in the world then is usually
assumed. This assumption can be used to refute the criticism on the
realist view on nuclear (non-)proliferation motivations.32 An additional
phenomenon regarding the security imperative which is sometimes
mentioned by academics is that nuclear weapons may provide deterrence
against larger states and / or groups of states, but not necessarily
against smaller, non-nuclear enemies. In this regard, much-mentioned
examples of non-nuclear parties that waged war against nuclear weapons
states are Vietnam against the United States, Chechnya against the
Russian Federation, and Argentina against the United Kingdom (during the
Falklands War). Apparently, nuclear weapons are not a hundred percent
reliable security guarantee against any military attacks.33 One may even
argue, as Robert Rothstein did in 1966, that the argument that nuclear
weapons offer security is hard to prove at all. Rothstein writes that
'It is the impact of nuclear weapons which is most ambiguous and
uncertain. Presumably they are designed to deter any enemy from
aggressive actions. But in the circumstances we can only be sure when
they fail, for the relationship between successful deterrence and
nuclear weapons is hardly clear. Obviously the enemy might never have
intended to attack at all or, conversely, could have intended to attack
but been deterred by other factors present in the situation. The
security argument is thus entirely hypothetical. It concerns what the
defender thinks he has achieved in felt security, not what he actually
has achieved.'34 Recent research by Ward Wilson also concludes that
there is no evidence in history that nuclear weapons deter enemies to
start any conflict: '\[\...\] many people take the peace that's being
experienced over the past sixty years as significant proof of the power
of nuclear deterrence. But there are some problems. First, proving the
something by using the absence of something is tricky. Second, there are
other factors that can adequately account for this period of peace
\[\...\].'35 Last but not least, it should be mentioned that few
researchers completely reject the importance of security considerations
as influencing (non-)proliferation dynamics. Many analysts recognize
that perceptions of external insecurity among state leaderships are a
necessary condition for decisions to start a nuclear weapons programme,
but that this condition alone is inadequate for explaining these
decisions; other motivational factors have to be combined with the
security motive.36 International Norms and Perceptions The third group
of motivations for states to acquire or not acquire nuclear weapons is
in this article titled 'International Norms and Perceptions'. This
cluster consists of various theories focusing on the role of perceptions
among states on the influence that nuclear weapons could have on their
position in the international community. On the one hand, these
perceptions can be influenced by **[internationally shared
norms]{.underline}** that [make the acquisition of nuclear weapons less
attractive -- especially those]{.underline} norms institutionalized
[in]{.underline} [international treaties like the]{.underline} Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty ([NPT]{.underline}). On the other hand, some of
these perceptions may make nuclear weapons more favourable, because
states may consider these weapons as increasing their status and
prestige. Due to the nonproliferation norms, however, **[status and
prestige]{.underline}** [may]{.underline} also [be perceived to
**increase by foregoing nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. The literature
on norms and perceptions on nuclear (non- )proliferation dynamics is
rather modest37, mostly because this area of research is relatively
young. Although especially prestige as a factor of influence on (non-
)proliferation has been acknowledged early in the nuclear era already,
in-depth research on norms and perceptions as motivational factors for
nuclear weapons has been very limited before the 2000s. The motivational
factor of international norms regarding states' decisions towards
nuclear weapons (non-)acquisition may be classified in several
theoretical schools within the studies of International Relations. Most
authors label the focus on norms as Constructivism38, but when combined
with the norm-setting role of institutions and treaties, it could also
be labelled as Liberalism, Neoliberalism or Neoliberal
Institutionalism.39 Some researchers label it as Utilitarianism.40
Although there is a difference in focus among these theoretical schools,
in this article they are all grouped into the 'International Norms and
Perceptions' factor. This is conceivable because all theories included
in this group are focussing on the normative environment41 for states in
general. It should be noticed that some aspects of Constructivist,
Liberal or Neoliberal theories will be incorporated in the fourth
motivational factor of this article: the Domestic Political Context.
Especially theories on the economic outlook of state leaders are
considered to belong to the (Neo-)Liberalist school as well42, yet this
article considers these particular theories as more domestically driven
(improving the national economy) than to be motivated by a wish to
adhere to international norms. The norms theory in (non-)proliferation
studies claims that decisions regarding nuclear weapons serve important
symbolic functions, depending on the perceived identity of the state (as
well as shaping this identity itself). Decisions in this regard are
determined by deeper norms and beliefs about what is legitimate and
appropriate in international relations. The most significant behavioural
norm regarding nuclear weapons is embodied in the international
non-proliferation regime consisting of several multilateral treaties and
United Nations resolutions, with the almost universal acceptance of the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as its core.43 Jacques Hymans
lucidly summarizes the effect of this non-proliferation regime as
follows: 'Most states think of themselves as, and want to be seen as,
good international citizens. Thanks at least in part to the
non-proliferation regime, there is today a widespread acceptance by
states that good international citizens do not build nuclear arsenals.
Therefore, the overwhelming majority of states have in fact not gone
nuclear.'44 A recent publication by Harald Müller and Andreas Schmidt
makes strong claims on the norm-setting impact of the NPT. Before the
NPT entered into force in 1970, they write, more than two-fifths of the
states that possessed the required capability to start nuclear weapons
activities did so. In the meantime, only a fraction of these states
renounced their nuclear programmes. After the NPT altered the normative
environment, however, the situation changed. Since 1970, less than 15
percent of the states that have the capacity to build nuclear weapons
did actually start such a programme. Even more important, they argue, is
that since 1970 almost 70 percent of all states that once started a
nuclear weapons programme ended this programme.45 The authors explain
this phenomenon by three ways in which the emergence of [international
norms influence the behaviour of states]{.underline}. First, the
non-proliferation [norms changed the **costs-benefits
calculations**]{.underline} [by states]{.underline}. [Because of the
broad supported non-prolif]{.underline}eration [regime]{.underline},
[including]{.underline} its [verification and export
control]{.underline} policies, [developing nuclear weapons will be more
difficult and costly]{.underline} (technically, financially, and
politically). Second, [the international norms affect the national
balance]{.underline} [of power between groups]{.underline} (within the
government as well as the elite in general) when they differ in opinion
on whether or not to develop nuclear weapons. Third, and [according
to]{.underline} [Müller and Schmidt]{.underline} most importantly, [the
international norms **change the assumptions about what is appropriate
state behaviour**]{.underline}. The emergence of the non-proliferation
norms made clear that [developing nuclear weapons is decisively **not
'what states do'**]{.underline}, even when faced with, for example,
security problems.46 Other analyses also warn that it is difficult to
prove a causal relationship between support for the NPT and the
restraint of (capable) states to develop nuclear weapons. One might
assume, these experts argue, that states that ratified the NPT simply
did not intend to develop weapons beforehand, instead of signing the NPT
under pressure of the norm while actually wishing for nuclear weapons.
One may claim that states that ratified the NPT are less likely to
acquire nuclear weapons, but it is not clear at all that they are less
likely to do so as a consequence of having ratified the treaty.47
Moreover, critics of the norms theory put forward that determined
proliferators will do whatever it takes to acquire nuclear weapons and
that international norms are probably the least obstacle. It is hard to
prove that the NPT did stop states from acquiring nuclear weapons, but
there are enough cases to prove that the NPT does not automatically stop
states to do so -- North Korea, Iran and Syria are examples of states
that ratified the NPT but still started a nuclear weapons programme.48
Proponents of the 'opaque proliferation' theory, discussed above, claim
that the non-proliferation regime only made nuclear weapons programmes
less visible because states wishing for these weapons behave even more
secretively than before.49 Contrary to the 'negative' norms regarding
nuclear weapons, also 'positive' norms exist, following which nuclear
weapons offer prestige and great power status. Agatha Wong-Frazer
describes the possession of nuclear weapons as 'a token entitling the
holder to claim a certain major power status'.50 As long as other states
adhere to these 'positive' norms, maybe even without being aware, the
status and prestige of nuclear weapons may offer the possessor more
diplomatic leverage, or, in other words, more enhanced international
bargaining power, towards these states.51 This kind of positive
perceptions of nuclear weapons is regularly labelled as 'symbolism',
because the weapons are not regarded positively because of their actual
usefulness as military weapons, but more because of their symbolic
value. Nuclear weapons are, in the perception of some observers, used to
show how modern, technological advanced, prestigious, powerful, and/or
sovereign the owner state is.52 Just like the non-proliferation norms,
these positive norms regarding nuclear weapons possession are linked to
a state's identity, self-image and (desired) position in the
international community. Karsten Frey names the positive and negative
norms 'the nuclear taboo' and 'the nuclear myth' respectively.53 Some
analysts consider 'mythmakers' as an important factor influencing
nuclear weapons related decisions -- in this article their role will be
discussed in the cluster on the domestic political context. Instead of
using the term 'myths', this article prefers to use the term
'perceptions' for this positive norms on nuclear weapons. 'Myths' have
the connotation of being untrue, while one may argue that nuclear
weapons truly give a state more international standing. Next to prestige
in the sense of great power status and modernity states may also be
motivated to start a nuclear weapons programme just to 'gain attention'.
When a state wants 'to be taken seriously' by other states but has
little to offer, pursuing nuclear weapons will attract attention for
sure -- maybe in a negative way, but still: attention is attention.
Nuclear weapons -- or only the demonstrated intention to acquire them --
may offer states more international status than they would normally
have, which in turn may lead to diplomatic, political and economic
benefits.54 Domestic political context The fourth cluster of factors
influencing nuclear weapons motivations is in this article entitled
'domestic political context'. The grouping of factors under this title
is more or less copied from Philipp Bleek, who uses the terminology of
'domestic politics' for a same kind of cluster.55 The present article
prefers, however, to combine Bleek's terminology with the concept
'domestic context' which is used by William Potter56 , merging it into
'domestic political context'. By adding the word 'political', domestic
factors like culture, geographical situation or technological
capabilities are excluded. This cluster of domestic political context
factors has many dimensions. Although one may criticize the diversity of
this cluster, in fact the various dimensions can all be brought back to
the domestic political situation in any state. The international
situation -- security, treaties, norms -- has nothing to do with it
directly, except maybe for how this situation is perceived and / or
exploited by certain domestic actors. Focussing on domestic political
factors as drivers for decisions to acquire or forgo nuclear weapons is
a relatively new branch of nuclear (non-)proliferation research.
Although the domestic political context is mentioned in some older
literature as (potentially) influential57, the more in-depth research
into this subject dates from the 2000s. Sagan in 1996-1997 had yet to
signal that there existed no well-developed political theory of nuclear
weapons proliferation identifying how these domestic factors actually
may influence decisions in this regard58, but ten years later two
pioneering studies were published by Jacques Hymans and Etel Solingen;
these studies will be described hereafter. Even nowadays, the number of
studies on domestic factors influencing nuclear weapons
(non-)proliferation is quite modest and the need for a more
sophisticated understanding of the domestic context is still being
emphasized in recent literature.59 A factor that is sometimes mentioned
in literature on (non-)proliferation dynamics, but on which no in-depth
research is known, is domestic turmoil that is perceived as threatening
the power of the state leadership. States facing domestic tensions may
use a nuclear weapons programme -- and the international condemning
reactions on it -- as a method of diversion. Nuclear weapons programmes
may respond to, or even bolster, nationalist sentiments and
international negative reactions may cause a 'rallying around the flag'
effect, ending domestic dissensions for some time. By diverting public
attention from unfavourable domestic issues, the regime could strengthen
its position.60 Related to this domestic turmoil aspect, Kurt Campbell
introduced the term 'regime pessimism' as a factor of potential
influence on nuclear weapons proliferation. He argues that especially
'states in decline' tend to consider developing nuclear weapons because
they 'often suffer from a kind of societal insecurity over future
economic and security shortfalls.' Due to this 'regime pessimism' states
may use a nuclear weapons programme to prevent the state sinking into
oblivion or being overshadowed by (regional) rival states.61 Another
factor grouped in this 'domestic political context' cluster is the
regime type of countries. In International Relations studies there
exists a substantial number of studies suggesting that democracies are
less likely to engage in armed conflict against each other compared to
autocracies, and some authors have suggested that this may also be the
case regarding the development of nuclear weapons. Some researchers that
studied this hypothesis conclude that democracies are less likely to
develop nuclear weapons, and they link this trend to the international
norms and perceptions factor. Müller and Schmidt, for example, argue
that '**[democracies]{.underline}** [show a relatively higher
probability to abide by the rule of law and to take efforts to be **good
international citizens**]{.underline}.' It should be acknowledged, they
admit, that [faithful norms observation is also common]{.underline}
behaviour [among]{.underline} **[autocracies]{.underline}**. '[Abiding
by]{.underline} **[i]{.underline}**nternational **[law]{.underline}**
[and its established norms is, by and large, normal behaviour in the
international society of states]{.underline}. However, some
nondemocracies are more likely to end up in the minority that deviates
from this normalcy. Totalitarian states with a power-seeking or paranoid
leadership are more likely to breach their obligations openly or
clandestinely.'62

George Shultz, former U.S. Secretary of State, once said, "Proliferation
begets proliferation[." The possession of nuclear weapons or nuclear
capability by a rival state is a constant stimulus to other states to
acquire them.]{.underline} It is often argued that possession of a
nuclear capability by Iran would lead to a nuclear cascade in the
region. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Turkey are likely to acquire nuclear
technology if Iran is allowed to have sensitive nuclear technology --
enrichment and reprocessing technology. **[This argument overlooks the
international and domestic factors that point to the fact that the
nuclear domino rarely falls.]{.underline}** **[Israel's acquisition of
nuclear weapons failed to bring about a nuclear arms race in the Middle
East and Iran's nuclear capability is also unlikely to have a domino
effect in the region]{.underline}**. [Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Turkey
are often cited as likely to proliferate, but all of them either lack
domestic capability or are bound by international factors that prevent
them from acquiring nuclear capability.]{.underline} Saudi Arabia is
often cited as likely to acquire nuclear capability after the Iranian
nuclear deal. Of the three most frequently identified potential
proliferators, Riyadh is perhaps the most likely one. Saudi Arabia and
Iran have a relatively antagonistic relationship. The Shiite mullahs who
came to power in Iran's Islamic revolution and the Sunni Saudi rulers
have long been antagonistic toward each other. Saudi Arabia provided
substantial financial assistance to Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war. It
opposed the United States' invasion of Iraq in 2003, to remove Saddam
Hussian because Riyadh saw Saddam as a counter balance against Tehran
and his removal would likely result in Iran's domination of the region.
Riyadh is against the Obama administration's nuclear negotiation with
Tehran because a nuclear Iran will become increasingly aggressive with
its regional hegemony. Saudi King Salman did not attend the summit
hosted by President Obama to build Arab support for Iran's nuclear deal
to demonstrate his displeasure. Saudi Arabia is threatening to acquire
nuclear technology if Iran is allowed to have enrichment technology.
These concerns were further fueled when Prince Turki al-Faisal, the
former head of Saudi intelligence warned, "I've always said whatever
comes out of these talks, we will want the same" and "if Iran has the
ability to enrich uranium to whatever level, it's not just Saudi Arabia
that's going to ask for that." In 2008 Riyadh signed a Memorandum of
Understanding with the United States in which it agreed not to pursue
enrichment technology. [Now if Riyadh wants to obtain enrichment
technology it either has to build it domestically or get it from the
international market. Saudi Arabia has little nuclear
infrastructure]{.underline}. [For this reason, it is often suggested
that were Saudi Arabia to attempt to obtain nuclear weapons, it would be
more likely to obtain nuclear technology and perhaps even weapons
outright from Pakistan. Saudi Arabia provided substantial funds to
Pakistan's nuclear weapons program]{.underline}. Recently, Pakistan
adopted a neutral position in the Yemen crisis, as aligning with Saudi
Arabia would have risked sectarian conflicts within Pakistan because of
its minority Shi'ite population, approximately twenty percent. Pakistan
also shares a border with Iran and it is unlikely to antagonize its
neighbor with a Shi'ite population at home. [Pakistan is already under
immense pressure to ensure the nonproliferation of its nuclear weapons
after Pakistani nuclear scientist A Q Khan's involvement in the transfer
of nuclear technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea. Pakistan's nuclear
program is India-centric and Islamabad has a strong strategic incentive
not to transfer its weapons to Riyadh and avoid opening up a second
front by becoming involved in the Saudi-Iranian conflict]{.underline}.
This means either Saudi Arabia has to build its own enrichment
technology or buy if from somewhere else. In the first option, Riyadh
has a rudimentary nuclear infrastructure and it might take two to three
decades to build this technology. In the second option, it is hard for
Saudi Arabia to buy enrichment technology from the international market.
The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) prohibits its 49 members from selling
enrichment technology to a state that might risk the proliferation of
nuclear weapons. It is evident that Riyadh is interested in obtaining
nuclear weapons and any would-be nuclear-seller would be under intense
international pressure not to sell this technology. There are four
states with enrichment technology outside the NSG: India, Pakistan,
Israel, and North Korea. India is bidding for NSG membership and has
always been proud of its impeccable record of not transferring its
nuclear technology. [New Delhi is highly unlikely to jeopardize its NSG
membership for Saudi Arabia. Pakistan is also demanding a NSG waiver
like India and has a strong interest in improving its international
image already plagued by the A Q Khan revelations]{.underline}. There
are rumors in the media that Israel might transfer its nuclear weapons
to Riyadh after Iran's deal, but such prospects are highly unlikely.
Israel maintains nuclear opacity and by transferring its technology
would further deteriorate its relations with the United States. At the
2015 NPT review conference Washington again blocked the resolution for a
Middle East Nuclear Weapons Free Zone (MENWFZ) that would have singled
out Tele Aviv to give up its nuclear weapons. In the case of North Korea
there is no self-evident link between Riyadh and Pyongyang. North Korea
is already under tight international scrutiny and any transfer would
prompt intelligence interception and international action. Egypt is
another likely proliferator after the Iranian deal. If Egypt did little
in response to Israel's nuclear weapons, especially in the 1960's when
the rivalry was particularly intense, it is not clear why it should be
expected to respond more robustly to Iran now. Cairo's main security
concern is Israel's nuclear weapons. **[It explored the nuclear weapons
program of its own, but ultimately abandoned it.]{.underline}** It
realized that its security is better served by pursuing a MENWFZ instead
of involving itself in a nuclear arms race. Relations between Tehran and
Cairo gradually improved through the 1990's and there is little question
that Egypt is extremely concerned about Iran's pursuit of nuclear
technology. Cairo's main concern is Israel's nuclear weapons and to
counter that threat it is advocating for a MENWFZ. In addition to Saudi
Arabia and Egypt, Turkey is often cited as likely to proliferate in
response to Iran. [It does not have an outright antagonistic
relationship with Iran and relations are presently more constructive
than antagonistic. Ankara also has limited nuclear infrastructure, and a
strong security relationship with Washington as a NATO
member]{.underline}. In the near term this appears an exceptionally
unlikely outcome for Ankara to acquire nuclear weapons. Turkey certainly
appears to be concerned by Iran's nuclear capability, not because of its
direct security or prestige ramifications for Ankara, but because of its
potential to provoke regional conflict and instability. Turkey has a
close relationship with the United States, as a member of NATO, with
U.S. nuclear weapons on its soil, and possessing a formal nuclear
security guarantee from the United States. [Given Turkey's not outright
antagonistic relationship with Iran, its limited nuclear infrastructure
and still good alliance relationship with the United States, Ankara
appears to be unlikely to acquire nuclear weapons in response to
Iran.]{.underline} There are strong chances that Iran and P5+1 will
conclude a comprehensive nuclear deal in which Tehran is allowed to have
limited enrichment technology with intrusive IAEA (International Atomic
Energy Agency) inspections. If Iran violates the negotiated agreement
and develops nuclear weapons there are ample chances that it would
result in a nuclear arms race in the region. **[Iran's nuclear program
constrained by a nuclear deal with the international community is
unlikely to cause a nuclear cascade in the region.]{.underline}**

Evaluating Catastrophic Risks [Though these technologies have the
potential for a wide array of benefits, the bad outcomes, if they do
occur, are truly catastrophic. The deployment of new weapons of mass
destruction could kill hundreds of millions or billions of people. Even
small probabilities of this outcome would give an expected loss on the
order of millions of deaths.]{.underline} As well as sheer loss of life,
[such a bad outcome could lead to the collapse of modern civilisation in
many or all parts of the world, undoing centuries of
progress1]{.underline}0. Even from a narrowly economic perspective, [the
cost of a tiny risk of such a global catastrophe is
staggering.]{.underline} Even assuming no long-term economic growth, and
a 3% discount rate, today's gross world product of \$70 trillion per
year implies that the present value of all future economic activity
exceeds \$2,000 trillion. If the Oxford-based risk estimate of 10% is
distributed evenly over the century, and we conservatively assume a
global catastrophe would wipe out one tenth of the value of
civilization, then the expected value of insuring against technological
catastrophe is at least \$200 billion each year. And this figure does
not account for risk aversion, nor include the non-financial worth of
humanity's scientific, artistic, and moral progress. Finally, [some of
these technologies, in particular synthetic biology and AGI, pose risks
to the continued survival of the human race]{.underline}. The importance
of preventing this from happening is difficult to overestimate. Only a
small fraction of the people who may ever live have already been born,
and human extinction therefore represents a loss of potential on a
tremendous scale11. [As the physicist Carl Sagan puts it: "If we are
required to calibrate extinction in numerical terms, I would be sure to
include the number of people in future generations who would not be
born.... Even if the population remains static, with an average lifetime
of the order of 100 years, over a typical time period for the biological
evolution of a successful species]{.underline} (roughly ten million
years), [we are talking about some 500 trillion people yet to
come."]{.underline} 12 Market and Political Complexity If these risks
are significant, and if addressing them is so important, one might
wonder why there hasn't already been more effort to reduce them.
However, several factors suggest that we should expect a large market
failure in the area. First, [reduction of the risk of a global
catastrophe is a global public good]{.underline}, as everyone benefits
and it is hard even for a large country doing such work to capture more
than a small proportion of the value. Markets typically undersupply such
goods, and large-scale cooperation is required to overcome this13. For
some threats the situation may be even worse, since even a single
non-compliant country could pose severe problems. Second, they are
unprecedented. [Risks tend to capture attention after an event of that
type transpires. But the nature of these risks may make learning from
experience impossible. So the measures we take against such risks are
inevitably speculative.]{.underline} In a normal market, speculators can
use their judgement to assess unprecedented scenarios, so these risks
are priced according to aggregate best judgement by the market even if
only a few people are considering them. For global public goods,
however, cooperation is needed, so all parties must come to an agreement
on how to value the risk. This is a much taller order. Third, [actions
we might take to ameliorate these risks are likely to involve
regulation]{.underline}. We can expect additional market failure here:
the costs are concentrated (on the regulators and the industries),
whereas the benefits are widely dispersed. When safety processes are
functioning these benefits may be largely invisible. This is a typical
case where lobbying is one-sided and so may hold too much sway. Finally,
any global catastrophe threatens to affect not just the people of today
but the people of tomorrow --- our children and grandchildren. Many of
the benefits of minimising such risks accrue to them: [**it is therefore
not just a public good, but an intergenerational public** good. Since
future generations have no say on decisions made today, it is likely
their interests are underrepresented in the status quo.]{.underline}
Moreover, short election cycles mean that political actors have limited
incentive to deal with these longer-term considerations.

#### Existential risks are unique impacts -- it's irreversible

Related Hazards", Journal of Evolution and Technology, Vol. 9, No. 1,

[Risks in this sixth category are a recent phenomenon.]{.underline} This
is part of the reason why [it is useful to distinguish them from other
risks. We have not evolved mechanisms]{.underline}, either biologically
or culturally, [for managing such risks.]{.underline} Our intuitions and
coping strategies have been shaped by our long experience with risks
such as dangerous animals, hostile individuals or tribes, poisonous
foods, automobile accidents, Chernobyl, Bhopal, volcano eruptions,
earthquakes, draughts, World War I, World War II, epidemics of
influenza, smallpox, black plague, and AIDS. These types of disasters
have occurred many times and our cultural attitudes towards risk have
been shaped by trial-and-error in managing such hazards. But tragic as
such events are to the people immediately affected, in the big picture
of things -- from the perspective of humankind as a whole -- even the
worst of these catastrophes are mere ripples on the surface of the great
sea of life. They haven't significantly affected the total amount of
human suffering or happiness or determined the long-term fate of our
species. With the exception of a species-destroying comet or asteroid
impact (an extremely rare occurrence), there were probably no
significant existential risks in human history until the mid-twentieth
century, and certainly none that it was within our power to do something
about. [The first manmade existential risk was the inaugural detonation
of an atomic bomb.]{.underline} At the time, there was some concern that
the explosion might start a runaway chain-reaction by "igniting" the
atmosphere. Although we now know that such an outcome was physically
impossible, it qualifies as an existential risk that was present at the
time. For there to be a risk, given the knowledge and understanding
available, it suffices that there is some subjective probability of an
adverse outcome, even if it later turns out that objectively there was
no chance of something bad happening. If we don't know whether something
is objectively risky or not, then it is risky in the subjective sense.
The subjective sense is of course what we must base our decisions
on.\[2\] At any given time we must use our best current subjective
estimate of what the objective risk factors are.\[3\] A [much greater
existential risk emerged with the build-up of nuclear arsenals in the US
and the USSR. An all-out nuclear war was a possibility with both a
substantial probability and with consequences that might have been
persistent enough to qualify as global and terminal.]{.underline} There
was a real worry among those best acquainted with the information
available at the time that a nuclear Armageddon would occur and that it
might annihilate our species or permanently destroy human
civilization.\[4\] Russia and the US retain large nuclear arsenals that
could be used in a future confrontation, either accidentally or
deliberately. There is also a risk that other states may one day build
up large nuclear arsenals. Note however that a smaller nuclear exchange,
between India and Pakistan for instance, is not an existential risk,
since it would not destroy or thwart humankind's potential permanently.
Such a war might however be a local terminal risk for the cities most
likely to be targeted. Unfortunately, [we shall see that nuclear
Armageddon and comet or asteroid strikes are mere preludes to the
existential risks that we will encounter in the 21st
century.]{.underline} The special nature of the challenges posed by
existential risks is illustrated by the following points: [· Our
approach to existential risks cannot be one of trial-and-error. There is
no opportunity to learn from errors]{.underline}. The reactive approach
-- see what happens, limit damages, and learn from experience -- is
unworkable. Rather[, we must take a proactive approach.]{.underline}
This requires foresight to anticipate new types of threats and a
willingness to take decisive preventive action and to bear the costs
(moral and economic) of such actions. · [We cannot necessarily rely on
the institutions, moral norms, social attitudes or national security
policies that developed from our experience with managing other sorts of
risks. Existential risks are a different kind of beast. We might find it
hard to take them as seriously as we should simply because we have never
yet witnessed such disasters.\[5\] Our collective fear-response is
likely ill calibrated to the magnitude of threat.]{.underline} ·
[Reductions in existential risks are global public goods]{.underline}
\[13\] and may therefore be undersupplied by the market \[14\].
[Existential risks are a menace for everybody and may require acting on
the international plane]{.underline}. Respect for national sovereignty
is not a legitimate excuse for failing to take countermeasures against a
major existential risk. · [If we take into account the welfare of future
generations, the harm done by existential risks is multiplied by another
factor, t]{.underline}he size of which depends on whether and how much
we discount future benefits \[15,16\]. In view of its undeniable
importance, it is surprising how little systematic work has been done in
this area. Part of the explanation may be that many of the gravest risks
stem (as we shall see) from anticipated future technologies that we have
only recently begun to understand. Another part of the explanation may
be the unavoidably interdisciplinary and speculative nature of the
subject. [And in part the neglect may also be attributable to an
aversion against thinking seriously about a depressing topic. The point,
however, is not to wallow in gloom and doom but simply to take a sober
look at what could go wrong so we can create responsible strategies for
improving our chances of survival. In order to do that, we need to know
where to focus our efforts.]{.underline}
