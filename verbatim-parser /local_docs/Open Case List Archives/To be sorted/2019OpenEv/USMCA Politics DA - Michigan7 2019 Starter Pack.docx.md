#### USMCA will pass now and is key to the economy -- it's Trump's top priority

**WASSON 6/11** (Erik; Bloomberg, "Democrats Signal Hope for Passing New
North America Trade Accord,"
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-11/democrats-signal-hope-for-passing-north-american-trade-deal)ww

[House Democrats are expressing optimism as they begin what could be the
final stage of negotiations to approve the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade
agreement, paving the way to vote on President Donald Trump's top
legislative priority]{.underline}. Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday is
expected to formally name lawmakers to the working groups that will work
with the administration on the labor, environment and pharmaceutical
provisions that Democrats are seeking to strengthen. Pelosi has also
emphasized the need for strong enforcement mechanisms in the accord that
will overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement. [Ways and Means
Chair]{.underline}man Richard [Neal]{.underline}, the Massachusetts
Democrat leading talks with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer,
[said]{.underline} Monday he hopes [a deal can be finalized within 30
days]{.underline}. The [Trump]{.underline} administration [has signaled
plans to send a bill implementing the USMCA to Congress by the end of
the month to prod lawmakers to vote on it before the August
recess]{.underline}. These signs of progress come after Trump withdrew
his threat to impose tariffs on Mexican imports over unrelated
immigration concerns. Senate Republicans applauded that decision, and
Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley met Monday with Pelosi, Neal and
Ways and Means Republican Kevin Brady to discuss how to move forward on
the USMCA. "We just wanted to point out despite the chaotic nature of
the tariff situation, we still wanted to stitch this up," Neal said.
Grassley requested that meeting, and he told House Democrats he wants to
be helpful in completing the USMCA, according to a Democratic aide.
Pelosi used the meeting to explain the provisions that need to be
reinforced to get more House Democrats to support the deal, the aide
said. "[We want to be on a path to yes]{.underline}," [Pelosi
said]{.underline} at a Peterson Foundation event Tuesday, stressing the
need for strong enforcement. If all parties can't be held to the
agreement, she said, "you're just having NAFTA with sprinkles on top."
Economic Growth [Grassley described Monday's meeting with Pelosi
as]{.underline} "[very successful]{.underline}." "[I think they're
putting a good-faith effort to work out differences]{.underline},"
[Grassley said of House Democrats]{.underline}. "There's a process in
place to do it. But those differences will have to be worked out before
we move it. The Senate Finance Committee will hold a hearing June 18
with Lighthizer to discuss the USMCA, Grassley later said in a
statement. [For weeks Republicans have said that the USMCA already has
enough votes to pass, counting on a combination of pro-trade lawmakers
from both parties]{.underline}. Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick
Mulvaney said Tuesday "[everybody knows it will pass the
House]{.underline}," [but]{.underline} suggested that [Pelosi is holding
out to get not only a majority of the full House of Representatives, but
also a majority of her caucus]{.underline}. Trump also urged Congress to
"do its job" and pass the trade deal that farmers are counting on to
secure the export markets they count on for their livelihood. White
House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said ratifying the [USMCA could be a
more important boost to the U.S. economy than reaching a trade deal with
China]{.underline}. [Congressional approval of Trump's trade
deal]{.underline}, which modernizes but doesn't fundamentally change the
decades-old NAFTA, [could add half a percentage point to economic
growth]{.underline}, Kudlow said in a Tuesday interview on CNBC.
'Unresolved Issues' A bicameral, bipartisan trade committee staff
delegation returned Saturday from a fact-finding mission in Mexico,
armed with suggestions on how the labor sections of the USMCA can be
improved. Democrats are working on turning those ideas into a concrete
offer to the White House, according to another Democratic aide who asked
not to be identified when talking about private discussions. "[There are
some unresolved issues]{.underline}; the task force is being formed
now," said Democratic Representative Ron Kind, a member of the Ways and
Means Committee. "The time has come to put something on paper." Kind
said Trump's decision not to impose the Mexico tariffs and to lift the
steel and aluminum tariffs the president previously imposed on Mexico
and Canada "will help focus a lot on the issues that need to be
resolved." The Wisconsin Democrat said he is pushing the administration
to increase funding for the arm of the U.S. Labor Department that
monitors international labor rights as part of any deal. Pelosi said
Tuesday she was interested in a proposal from Democratic Senators
Sherrod Brown and Ron Wyden that could help Mexico enforce the
provisions to support workers. "There is a growing awareness that you
don't get in the ballpark without a tough enforcement regime," Wyden
said. "There's been a lot of back and forth and long meetings with the
Trump administration on this. " The House Democratic staff returned from
Mexico hopeful that country can implement its labor revisions, while
acknowledging that it could take four to six years. Among the staff
suggestions are changes to the USMCA to aid Mexico's labor overhaul,
which includes setting up new institutions and auditing 700,000
collective bargaining agreements. Mexico is engaged in austerity
measures that could stymie the labor changes by depriving them of
workplace inspectors. The staff delegation also discussed environment
issues and is working on proposals on that. In Good Faith "I talked to
Ambassador Lighthizer last night and everyone understands the things
that need to be fixed," said Representative Debbie Dingell of Michigan.
"There are a number of us who want to get a trade bill. We need a new
NAFTA." "[People are working toward getting a good bill]{.underline},"
Dingell added. [Democrats say they will continue to work in good
faith]{.underline} even as they fear that Trump could once again
threaten Mexico if he feels pressure over migration. The key sticking
point may be how to improve enforcement. Under the original NAFTA, its
provisions are enforced by binding arbitration panels. Those are no
longer used because the country accused of a violation can simply block
the formation of a panel. Democrats are mulling whether to propose
outlawing panel-blocking under the new agreement. Rhode Island Democrat
David Cicilline, [the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee
chair]{.underline}man, [said he is]{.underline} also
[optimistic]{.underline}. "[I think everyone has been very clear about
what it would take to have sufficient Democrats votes to
prevail]{.underline}," [he said]{.underline}.

#### Ending arms sales requires a veto override

**KERR 4/1** (Paul K.; Specialist in Nonproliferation -- Congressional
Research Service, "Arms Sales: Congressional Review Process,"
https://fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/RL31675.pdf)ww

In general, the executive branch, after complying with the terms of
applicable U.S. law, principally contained in the AECA, is free to
proceed with an arms sales proposal unless Congress passes legislation
prohibiting or modifying the proposed sale. [Under current law Congress
faces two fundamental obstacles to block or modify a presidential sale
of military equipment: it must pass legislation expressing its will on
the sale, and it must be capable of overriding a presumptive
presidential veto of such legislation]{.underline}. Congress, however,
is free to pass legislation to block or modify an arms sale at any time
up to the point of delivery of the items involved. This report will be
updated, if notable changes in these review procedures or applicable law
occur.

#### Veto overrides tank political capital

**ZIPPERER '18** (Eddie; Professor of Political Science -- Georgia
Military College, "Why Vetoing the Omnibus Could Have Been Disastrous
for Trump," 3/26,
https://dailycaller.com/2018/03/26/why-vetoing-the-omnibus-could-have-been-disastrous-for-trump/)ww

If the \$1.3. trillion omnibus spending bill teaches us anything, it's
that bipartisanship is expensive and wildly overrated. The enduring myth
of American politics is that bipartisan bills are a legislative Holy
Grail that brave Knights of the RINO Table like Sir Marco of Florida
must zealously Crusade after as a matter of honor. But, in reality,
bipartisanship usually looks more like a doomed marriage between two
fiscally irresponsible people: Should we buy a new car or put in a new
swimming pool? Both! Should we send the kids to college or first-class
our way through Europe for the summer? Both! Should we max out all our
credit cards or put a third mortgage on the house? Both! Then, it's
back-slaps all around for being legendary compromisers when nothing was
actually compromised except financial security. "Bipartisanship" has
become code for "everybody gets to wet their beak in the taxpayer pond."
That's why it would have been so satisfying to see President Trump use
his Constitutional Trump card to veto the spending bill. Conservatives
on Twitter were begging President Trump to do it after he flirted with
the idea in a Friday morning tweet that read: "I am considering a VETO
of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus
DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even
mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for
our National Defense, is not fully funded." Conservative radio host Mark
Levin tweeted, "VETO the massive spending and borrowing bill, Mr.
President!" In the end, President Trump rebuked Congress but signed the
bill, letting all the air out of Conservative Twitter. Fox News host
Laura Ingraham tweeted that it was a "missed opportunity" and Ann
Coulter tweeted to Mr. Trump, "You'll be impeached." But, as terrible as
the bill was, Mr. [Trump]{.underline} didn't miss an opportunity -- he
[sidestepped a political landmine]{.underline}. There's an excellent
chance his veto would have been overridden by 2/3 supermajorities in
both Houses of Congress. [Democrats would]{.underline} have
[jump]{.underline}ed [at the chance to rebuke a Trump veto]{.underline}.
Even the Democrats who voted against the bill to begin with would have
snatched up that opportunity to #resist. They'd have framed it as an
issue of governing principle. They'd have made statements like, "I
didn't like the bill personally, but we cannot allow President Trump to
unilaterally reject bipartisanship." For Republicans, overriding the
veto would have been the path of least resistance. They're on their way
home from D.C. They're kicked back in their first-class seats with a
warm towel and a mimosa having no expectation that the President was
even considering a veto. It would have been a blindside veto and
sustaining it would have put them in a position where the government
would shut down at midnight unless they went back, added DACA to the
negotiations, cut spending on Democratic priorities and then somehow
magically got the Democratic votes they needed to satisfy rule 22's 3/5
cloture requirement. The Democrats got annihilated in the court of
public opinion when they shut down the government over DACA. For Trump
to turn around and do the same would have been begging for rebuke.
Remember all those checks and balances from your high school Civics
class? Sure the President can veto a bill passed by Congress, but then
Congress can veto the veto. [What they don't teach in that civics class
are the implications of a veto override]{.underline}. [If Trump had been
overridden]{.underline} the very first time he ever exercised the veto
power, [it would have sent the message that Congress has the final
say---that Congress is in charge, and the president]{.underline}, who is
being investigated by a special council, is up to his ears in sex
scandals being pushed by the mainstream media, and whose approval rating
hovers around 40 percent, [is a lame-duck rubber stamp]{.underline}. [It
would have been a disastrous rebuke of President Trump, and it would
have dealt a severe blow to his]{.underline} already-overdrawn account
of [political capital]{.underline}. Throughout American history, the
average Presidential success rate when exercising the veto is about 88
percent. Only around 20 times has a president had a veto overridden when
his party controlled both houses of Congress. That hasn't happened to
any president since it happened to one-term-disaster Jimmy Carter 38
years ago. Only two presidents in American history have had their very
first veto overridden, and only one president in American history has
had his very first veto overridden when his party controlled both House
of Congress. That was Herbert Hoover. And joining a Presidential-list
club whose only member is Herbert Hoover should be avoided at all costs.
CNN and MSNBC would be wall to wall Hoover chyrons for a week. Trump
made a greater impact by verbally rebuking Congress, and he showed he's
capable of taking the pragmatic road over the dramatic one.

#### Economic decline causes war.

**Posen 18** (Adam S, President of the Peterson Institute for
International Economics, PhD in Political Economy and Government from
Harvard University; "The Post-American World Economy: Globalization in
the Trump Era", March/April 2018,
<https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2018-02-13/post-american-world-economy>)

[The]{.underline} United States' [motivation for]{.underline} building
[the postwar economic system was]{.underline} [as much **preventing
conflict** as]{.underline} promoting [growth.]{.underline} In setting
out the rules by which all members would conduct business, the
architects of the system hoped to separate economic from military
competition. U.S. withdrawal need not result in economic or physical
wars, but it will raise the risk of stumbling into conflict by accident.
[Without]{.underline} agreed-on [rules, even minor economic disputes
have the potential to set off **escalating
counterattacks**]{.underline}. If the norm of separation between
economic and military confrontations breaks down, **[economic
frictions]{.underline}**, such as Chinese theft of intellectual property
or restrictions on trade with a nuclear Iran or North Korea, [could turn
into **outright conflict**]{.underline}. It is plausible that [as the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates retreats and thereby [weakens
its economy]{.underline}, the [Trump]{.underline} administration [will
**blame**]{.underline} the [economic damage]{.underline} not on its own
actions but [on foreign governments, creating a **self-perpetuating
cycle of anger**. When]{.underline} other major [countries step forward
to preserve the]{.underline} open economic [order, or defend
themselves]{.underline} against U.S. economic aggression, [Washington
may **interpret that as an attack** on U.S. primacy]{.underline}. The
[Trump]{.underline} administration [might]{.underline} even
[misinterpret the]{.underline} current [forbearance by China or the EU
as a **sign of weakness** and an **invitation to escalate**]{.underline}
confrontations.

### 2NC Will Pass

#### USMCA will ultimately pass, but House Dems still need to be won over, and the clock is ticking - PC is key to get a deal done

**EDGERTON 6/10** (Anna; Fortune, "Democrats Hold Out on USMCA as Trump
Walks Back Mexico Tariffs,"
http://fortune.com/2019/06/10/usmca-trade-deal-mexico-tariffs/)ww

President Donald [Trump's decision not to impose tariffs on Mexico
removed one obstacle for Congress to approve his North American trade
deal, but his administration has more work to do to smooth the final
stages of the accord's ratification]{.underline}. Trump accepted
Mexico's offer of tougher immigration enforcement as sufficient to
dissuade him from levying a 5% charge on all Mexican imports. The move
late Friday deflated tensions with Mexico and, as far as Canada is
concerned, clears a path for the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement to
move forward, Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau said Sunday on
Bloomberg TV. [That leaves House Democrats as the last major
stakeholders still to get on board]{.underline}. Speaker Nancy [Pelosi's
decision on when (and whether) the deal will get a vote depends on talks
with the Trump administration]{.underline} to address Democrats'
concerns, according to a senior Democratic aide. "[We're not
ready]{.underline},'' Representative Debbie [Dingell]{.underline}, a
Michigan Democrat, [said]{.underline} Sunday on Fox News. "The votes in
the House are not there yet until these changes take place.'' During
last week's uncertainty over trade with Mexico, most Democrats publicly
separated USMCA deliberations from Trump's tariff plan, which means that
[removing the tariff threat doesn't necessarily clear the way for a new
deal to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement]{.underline}.
Dingell said she wants changes to the agreement's labor, environmental
and enforcement provisions that would satisfy her skeptical colleagues.
[Deciding against the Mexican tariffs does, however, help the president
with his own party --- especially in the Republican-led
Senate]{.underline}. Revamped Nafta Finance Committee Chairman Chuck
Grassley of Iowa warned last week that the USMCA --- Trump's top
legislative priority this year --- would be in peril if the president
went ahead with the Mexican tariffs. [House Republicans for weeks have
said the revamped trade deal]{.underline}, which updates but doesn't
fundamentally alter the decades-old NAFTA, [would pass the House if only
Pelosi would put it on the floor]{.underline}. Louisiana Representative
Steve Scalise, a top member of GOP leadership, renewed that call Friday
after Trump said he won't impose tariffs on Mexico, lauding the
breakthrough that "puts us in a better position to make USMCA a
reality." The lawmaker working groups that Pelosi appointed to negotiate
with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer are beginning to drill
down on the details of how to resolve Democrats' outstanding issues,
according to the aide, who asked not to be named when talking about
internal discussions. [Pelosi has repeatedly said that her
members]{.underline} "[want to get to yes]{.underline}," but only if the
agreement resolves their doubts. Democrats have pushed Mexico to pass
and swiftly implement labor reforms that would, among other things,
allow workers there to vote for union representation with a closed
ballot. 2020 Timing [Trade in general has become a complicated
ideological and electoral issue]{.underline} since Trump in his 2016
campaign denounced Nafta as the worst example of globalism run amok with
little regard for U.S. workers. Trump's position sets him apart from
free-trade Republicans, and it also creates a dilemma for 2020
Democratic candidates. [Democrats traditionally have been more skeptical
than Republicans when it comes to free trade]{.underline}. [The 2020
presidential race also squeezes the timing for a vote on the bill to
implement the USMCA]{.underline}. [Lawmakers of both parties have warned
that passing such a deal will be politically tricky in an election
year]{.underline}. [That means the best chance for a vote would be
before Congress recesses in August to avoid typical end-of-the-year
budget fights]{.underline}, according to North Carolina Representative
Mark Meadows, a close Trump ally. "[Hopefully, we can get together and
make sure that happens in the latter part of July]{.underline},''
[Meadows said]{.underline} on Fox News's "Sunday Morning Futures.'' Even
amid rising tensions from Trump's tariff threat, Mexican President
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has reaffirmed his support for the new Nafta
deal. Its prospects in Mexico's Congress are good, given the support of
Lopez Obrador, whose party controls the nation's legislative branch.
Major opposition parties also want it to be enacted. Nonetheless, the
tariff confrontation may have created lasting damage to ties between the
two countries. Republicans previously pleaded with Trump to remove steel
and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and they've publicly worried
about the lasting impact of changes to global commerce as a result of
Trump's multi-front trade wars. Even as Trump retains some bipartisan
support for taking a hard stance against Chinese trade practices, few
lawmakers wanted him to rip up the accord with Mexico and Canada without
a replacement. The USMCA came together after more than a year of
painstaking negotiations. Senator Thom [Tillis]{.underline}, a North
Carolina Republican who's up for re-election in 2020, [said he has "no
doubt'' **there's enough support in the Senate** to ratify the
agreement.]{.underline} [With help from pro-trade
Republicans]{.underline}, Tillis said Sunday on Fox, **[the
Democratic-led House should be able to pass it as well]{.underline}**.
"Now that we've gotten the threat of tariffs out of the way, I hope that
Speaker Pelosi will put that on the House floor,'' he said.

#### Will Pass -- Better than 2/3's chance

**SALAMA 6/11** (Vivian; Wall Street Journal, "Mulvaney Sees Approval of
USMCA Trade Deal Likely,"
https://www.wsj.com/articles/mulvaney-sees-approval-of-usmca-trade-deal-likely-11560292213)ww

[The U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement has "a better than two-thirds
chance" of passing through Congress this year]{.underline}, President
Trump's acting chief of staff said Tuesday, adding [its approval depends
on support among House Democrats]{.underline}. Acting White House Chief
of Staff Mick Mulvaney says he has found a happy medium between the
management styles of John Kelly and Reince Priebus that suits President
Trump\'s unconventional style. Speaking at The Wall Street Journal CFO
Network meeting, Mick Mulvaney said [the successor deal to the North
American Free Trade Agreement has many supporters in the House, and a
likely majority in the full chamber, but]{.underline} Speaker Nancy
[Pelosi]{.underline} (D., Calif.) [is unlikely to bring it to the floor
without a clear majority of Democrats]{.underline}. "I don't think Nancy
can bring it to the floor until she has something approaching the
majority" in her own party, he said. "We know [there are champions of
this bill in the House]{.underline}. We know that [labor supports
it]{.underline}; we know that [agriculture supports it]{.underline}; we
know that [manufacturing supports it]{.underline}, although the typical
[Rust Belt Democrats]{.underline}---[that's their base]{.underline},
they [support this deal]{.underline} and they know that it's better than
Nafta." Mrs. Pelosi has signaled they won't allow a vote on USMCA
without certain changes, including easier enforcement of new rules
designed to strengthen labor rights in Mexico. The deal must still be
ratified by the U.S., Canada and Mexico to go into effect. In her own
comments Monday, Mrs. Pelosi said enforcing the new provisions was key.
Labor rights are central to her base, which wants to raise wages in
Mexico to reduce the incentive to ship jobs outside the U.S. "I thought
that would be the easiest trade bill we've ever had the opportunity to
pass because those who are unhappy with Nafta really want to have a new
Nafta," Mrs. Pelosi said at an event at the Peterson Foundation. "If you
don't have enforcement, you're just having Nafta again with sprinkles on
top." Mr. Mulvaney said that frustration is building at the White House
over the opposition to the trade deal, which was designed to garner
support from both political parties.

#### Dem objections will be resolved

[The administration is making progress resolving House Democrats'
objections]{.underline} to a proposed North American trade deal in talks
with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Robert E. Lighthizer, the president's
chief trade negotiator, told lawmakers on Tuesday. "My hope is that
[over the next couple of weeks we can make substantial
progress]{.underline}," Lighthizer told members of the Senate Finance
Committee. "I believe [we're on track]{.underline}." [The trade
chief]{.underline}, who has [said]{.underline} he wants bipartisan
support for the deal, praised Pelosi as "completely fair and above
board" in their ongoing dialogue. The speaker has established working
groups of House Democrats to work on revisions to the agreement's labor,
environment, pharmaceuticals and enforcement terms. [The administration
is pushing for Congress to quickly approve the new deal]{.underline} ---
a replacement for the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
--- [before breaking for August recess]{.underline}. "[We want this to
be dealt with as soon as possible]{.underline}," [Lighthizer
said]{.underline}. But Pelosi, and other senior Democrats, say the
proposed U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) must be reopened to add
tougher enforcement provisions --- something the administration says is
unnecessary. Lighthizer called the pact the "strongest, most momentous
agreement in U.S. history," adding that it would "help stop the outflow
of manufacturing jobs and return many to the United States." The deal is
"completely enforceable," Lighthizer said, adding that he would work
with lawmakers to make it "even more enforceable."

sell skeptical Democrats on NAFTA replacement,"
https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/18/politics/nafta-replacement-stakes-congress/index.html)ww

From the start, US Trade Representative Robert [Lighthizer has argued he
can get Democrats to support]{.underline} President Donald [Trump\'s
replacement for]{.underline} the [N]{.underline}orth
[A]{.underline}merican [F]{.underline}ree [T]{.underline}rade
[A]{.underline}greement. Now it\'s time to see if he can deliver.
Lighthizer appeared before the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday and
is set to testify before the House Ways and Means Committee on
Wednesday. [He is touting Trump\'s revised trilateral trade deal, adding
to the administration\'s efforts to pass the agreement over the
summer]{.underline} \-- a drive to secure key 2016 campaign promise
heading into the 2020 campaign season. [He\'s up against fresh
resistance]{.underline} after triggering consideration of Trump\'s
US-Mexico-Canada Agreement on the same day that his boss issued a
surprise threat of tariffs on Mexican goods last month, drawing rare
outcry from Republicans. Members of both parties are also irritable over
the looming possibility of national security tariffs on foreign cars and
auto parts, which would hit the US operations of foreign manufacturers.
The list of people he hopes to sell includes members such as Connecticut
Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro, who voted no on the original NAFTA and who
issued a scathing statement trashing the USMCA last month. She\'s among
the Democrats on a working group appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
to piece together a deal with Lighthizer. The group, led by Ways and
Means Chairman Rep. Richard Neal, also includes Reps. Earl Blumenauer,
Suzanne Bonamici, Jan Schakowsky, Jimmy Gomez, John Larson, Terri Sewell
and Mike Thompson, according to a House Democratic aide. Trump has
repeatedly suggested that if he can\'t get cooperation from Congress, he
will withdraw from the 25-year-old pact, disrupting the global economy
and deeply-entrenched supply chains, if Democrats don\'t ratify his
replacement. Republicans have convinced Trump to stand down on scrapping
NAFTA in the past. Such a move would likely trigger legal battles over
whether Trump has the authority to unilaterally withdraw from trade
agreements. On Tuesday, Lighthizer will argue Trump\'s [USMCA is already
strong in key areas House Democrats have emphasized most --- labor and
environmental protections and enforcement --- but he will also indicate
openness to negotiating with lawmakers in drafting the implementing text
of the deal]{.underline}. \"I am aware of specific areas where Members
have ideas to strengthen the agreement, and we are having constructive
discussions on how to make improvements,\" [Lighthizer said]{.underline}
in his opening statement. \"My hope is that [working with members, we
can submit implementing legislation that Congress can approve very
soon]{.underline}.\" \"[I continue to believe that the USMCA will win
broad support in Congress, as it is designed to do]{.underline},\" [he
said]{.underline}.

**EDGERTON 6/10** (Anna; Fortune, "Democrats Hold Out on USMCA as Trump
Walks Back Mexico Tariffs,"
http://fortune.com/2019/06/10/usmca-trade-deal-mexico-tariffs/)ww

President Donald [[Trump's decision not to impose tariffs on Mexico
removed one obstacle]{.mark} for Congress to approve his North American
trade deal, [but his administration has more work to do]{.mark} to
smooth the final stages of the accord's ratification]{.underline}. Trump
accepted Mexico's offer of tougher immigration enforcement as sufficient
to dissuade him from levying a 5% charge on all Mexican imports. The
move late Friday deflated tensions with Mexico and, as far as Canada is
concerned, clears a path for the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement to
move forward, Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau said Sunday on
Bloomberg TV. [That leaves House Democrats as the last major
stakeholders still to get on board]{.underline}. Speaker Nancy [Pelosi's
decision on when (and whether) the deal will get a vote depends on talks
with the Trump administration]{.underline} to address Democrats'
concerns, according to a senior Democratic aide. "[We're not
ready]{.underline},'' Representative Debbie [Dingell]{.underline}, a
Michigan Democrat, [said]{.underline} Sunday on Fox News. "The votes in
the House are not there yet until these changes take place.'' During
last week's uncertainty over trade with Mexico, most Democrats publicly
separated USMCA deliberations from Trump's tariff plan, which means that
[[removing the tariff threat doesn't necessarily clear the way]{.mark}
for a new deal to replace the North American Free Trade
Agreement]{.underline}. Dingell said she wants changes to the
agreement's labor, environmental and enforcement provisions that would
satisfy her skeptical colleagues. [[Deciding against the Mexican tariffs
does, however, help the president with his own party]{.mark} ---
especially in the Republican-led Senate]{.underline}. Revamped Nafta
Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa warned last week that
the USMCA --- Trump's top legislative priority this year --- would be in
peril if the president went ahead with the Mexican tariffs. [House
Republicans for weeks have said the revamped trade deal]{.underline},
which updates but doesn't fundamentally alter the decades-old NAFTA,
[would pass the House if only Pelosi would put it on the
floor]{.underline}. Louisiana Representative Steve Scalise, a top member
of GOP leadership, renewed that call Friday after Trump said he won't
impose tariffs on Mexico, lauding the breakthrough that "puts us in a
better position to make USMCA a reality." The lawmaker working groups
that Pelosi appointed to negotiate with U.S. Trade Representative Robert
Lighthizer are beginning to drill down on the details of how to resolve
Democrats' outstanding issues, according to the aide, who asked not to
be named when talking about internal discussions. [Pelosi has repeatedly
said that her members]{.underline} "[want to get to yes]{.underline},"
but only if the agreement resolves their doubts. Democrats have pushed
Mexico to pass and swiftly implement labor reforms that would, among
other things, allow workers there to vote for union representation with
a closed ballot. 2020 Timing [Trade in general has become a complicated
ideological and electoral issue]{.underline} since Trump in his 2016
campaign denounced Nafta as the worst example of globalism run amok with
little regard for U.S. workers. Trump's position sets him apart from
free-trade Republicans, and it also creates a dilemma for 2020
Democratic candidates. [Democrats traditionally have been more skeptical
than Republicans when it comes to free trade]{.underline}. [The 2020
presidential race also squeezes the timing for a vote on the bill to
implement the USMCA]{.underline}. [Lawmakers of both parties have warned
that passing such a deal will be politically tricky in an election
year]{.underline}. [That means the best chance for a vote would be
before Congress recesses in August to avoid typical end-of-the-year
budget fights]{.underline}, according to North Carolina Representative
Mark Meadows, a close Trump ally. "[Hopefully, we can get together and
make sure that happens in the latter part of July]{.underline},''
[Meadows said]{.underline} on Fox News's "Sunday Morning Futures.'' Even
amid rising tensions from Trump's tariff threat, Mexican President
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has reaffirmed his support for the new Nafta
deal. Its prospects in Mexico's Congress are good, given the support of
Lopez Obrador, whose party controls the nation's legislative branch.
Major opposition parties also want it to be enacted. Nonetheless, the
tariff confrontation may have created lasting damage to ties between the
two countries. Republicans previously pleaded with Trump to remove steel
and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and they've publicly worried
about the lasting impact of changes to global commerce as a result of
Trump's multi-front trade wars. Even as Trump retains some bipartisan
support for taking a hard stance against Chinese trade practices, few
lawmakers wanted him to rip up the accord with Mexico and Canada without
a replacement. The USMCA came together after more than a year of
painstaking negotiations. Senator Thom [Tillis]{.underline}, a North
Carolina Republican who's up for re-election in 2020, [said he has "no
doubt'' **there's enough support in the Senate** to ratify the
agreement.]{.underline} [With help from pro-trade
Republicans]{.underline}, Tillis said Sunday on Fox, **[the
Democratic-led House should be able to pass it as well]{.underline}**.
"Now that we've gotten the threat of tariffs out of the way, I hope that
Speaker Pelosi will put that on the House floor,'' he said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - [Mexico on Wednesday became the **first country
to ratify** the]{.underline} United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement
(**[USMCA]{.underline}**) agreed late last year to replace the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) at the behest of U.S. President
Donald Trump. [By a vote of **114 in favor to 4 against**]{.underline},
[Mexico's Senate backed the deal tortuously negotiated]{.underline}
between 2017 and 2018 after Trump repeatedly threatened to withdraw from
NAFTA if he could not get a better trade agreement for the United
States. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador had already
anticipated ratification this week in the Senate, where his leftist
National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) and its allies have a
comfortable majority in the 128-member chamber. [There has been little
parliamentary opposition in Mexico]{.underline} to trying to safeguard
market access to United States, by far Mexico's top export destination,
and the trade deal was approved with overwhelming cross-party support in
the Senate. Mexico sends around 80% of its exports to the United States,
and Trump last month vowed to impose tariffs on all Mexican goods if
Lopez Obrador does not reduce the flow of U.S.-bound illegal immigration
from Central America. Lopez Obrador says he wants to avoid conflict with
Trump, but noted at the weekend that the tariff dispute showed Mexico
needed to become more economically self-sufficient. [Trump
congratulated]{.underline} Lopez [Obrador]{.underline} on Twitter [for
Mexico's approval. "Time for Congress to do the same here!" he
wrote.]{.underline} Lopez Obrador, meanwhile, posted a video on Twitter
in which he called the Senate's approval "very good news" and said it
augured well for Mexico's relations with the United States.
**[Canada]{.underline}**, [which has also fought with Trump over trade,

Neil Bradley, the Chamber\'s executive vice president and chief policy

concerns raised by Democrats seriously, but **we think the gaps are
bridgeable**]{.underline}.\" Bradley said he was basing his information
on conversations he had with various members he didn\'t name. [There is
**considerable support** for the legislation **within the Democrat
ranks** even if they aren\'t vocal about it]{.underline}, argued John
Murphy, the Chamber\'s senior vice president for international policy.
\"The number of members of Congress who are keeping their powder dry is
high,\" Murphy said. \"[Thinking back to past trade

**[That\'s not where we are now.]{.underline}** [There is a **large

Senator [Grassley]{.underline} says he spoke with Speaker Nancy Pelosi
about this last week and [understands why she has been **unable to

Trump and Lighthizer believe that [the USMCA's labor and environmental
provisions, the inclusion of wage-levels as a component of Rules of
Origin, and the limitation of ISDS should contribute to Democratic
support of the agreement]{.underline}, expected to move forward under
TPA rules for congressional approval in March 2019. Certainly, Democrats
and Republicans began to grasp the downside of walking away from the
integrated North American market during the 13 months of NAFTA
renegotiations. [However, trade votes are always difficult for
Democrats, to say nothing of a Trump-branded agreement]{.underline}.
[Hard-to-ignore labor unions and environmental groups are already
agitating for additional concessions]{.underline}. Both [to pressure for
passage and to show strength, it is possible that]{.underline} President
[Trump would withdraw from]{.underline} the agreement next year under
[NAFTA]{.underline} Article 2205, starting a 6- month clock after which
the United States may exit the deal. [The stark choice between blowing
up intertwined North American supply chains and taking a hard trade vote
should push Congress to approve USMCA]{.underline}, though with some
drama attached. [House]{.underline}
[Dem]{.underline}ocrat[s]{.underline} [are already foreshadowing an
effort to revive/reinforce the types of commitments made in the
bipartisan]{.underline} "May 10th Agreement" from 2007, which gave
Democrats cover to vote on [Bush-era FTAs]{.underline}. Representative
Levin (R-MI), an original May 10 co-author, has stated, "The challenge
became to take the clear language in May 10, which was a breakthrough,
and make it real." [This will take time and political
capital]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} as US farmers and ranchers
continue to suffer under 232 and 301 retaliatory tariffs, [preserving
free trade in North America should be a]{.underline} (reluctant)
[priority of most lawmakers, despite intense political
pressure]{.underline}. [Republican control of the Senate should

Writing before the mid-term election results are in, we anticipate that
President Donald J. Trump will continue to aggressively pursue his
original campaign pledge to rebalance relationships with key US trading
partners. Whichever party controls either chamber of Congress, President
Trump will likely continue pushing the boundaries of Executive authority
to pursue policy objectives unilaterally. [The President will
not]{.underline}, however, [be able to ignore Congress]{.underline}
entirely. President [Trump will]{.underline} quickly [need]{.underline}
the new [Congress for legislation to implement]{.underline} the US --
Mexico -- Canada ([USMCA]{.underline}) trade agreement. [This is a key
policy objective]{.underline} for President [Trump]{.underline}, and was
a leading campaign promise in 2016. [Yet, Congressional approval of the
deal is far from certain]{.underline}, regardless of which party
controls the House and Senate. [The President and his team will have to
expend significant political capital to move the USMCA through
Congress]{.underline}. Similarly, President Trump will need
Congressional support to implement any bilateral trade agreements the
Administration negotiates with the United Kingdom (UK), the European
Union (EU), and other sovereign nations in the next two years. But,
because trade does not cut along party lines, President Trump\'s
disruptive trade policies could find allies and opponents on both sides
of the aisle.

#### Trump's political capital is key to passage

**ADAIR '18** (Andrew C.; J.D., "The Week in Washington --- Trump
Delivers on Trade, Supreme Court, Amid Collateral Damage," 10/8,
http://www.dc-berlin.com/the-week-in-washington-trump-delivers-on-trade-supreme-court-amid-collateral-damage/)ww

The business community, members of Congress, and America's trading
partners spent last week digesting the 1,800-page text of the
U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement ([USMCA]{.underline}) --- drafted to
replace the existing North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between
the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Although the USMCA preserves
NAFTA's tariff-free trade on a wide range of items, it also includes
substantial changes to key areas for German business --- most notably to
the rules for automotive goods. The parties also created new rules for
industries that have substantially matured since 1994 (e.g. biologic
drugs, and digital commerce). And the agreement sends important signals
to China, by restricting currency manipulation, and discouraging the
parties from forming free-trade agreements with non-market countries.
[In order to come into force]{.underline}, [Congress]{.underline}, as
well as the legislatures of both Canada and Mexico, [must approve
it]{.underline}. Of primary importance to German automakers and
suppliers, the deal will change the rules of origin for automotive
goods. To qualify for duty-free treatment, cars must contain 75 percent
regional content, and 40 percent of the labor must come from workers
earning a wage of at least \$16 per hour (these requirements would be
phased in over a five-year period). Car makers must also source 70
percent of their steel and aluminum from the USMCA bloc. The agreement
also strengthens labor standards. The Trump Administration extracted
these concessions --- primarily from Mexico --- through the threat of
tariffs on cars and auto parts; in fact the final deal includes side
letters to both Canada and Mexico, in which the U.S. promises to exempt
from punitive automotive tariffs the first 2.6 million passenger cars
from each country annually. The new rules of origin and quotas would
almost definitely impact the global German automakers with production
facilities in Mexico (principally BMW, Daimler, and VW) as well as the
suppliers (Continental and Bosch). John Bozzella of the Association of
Global Automakers predicted that USMCA would cause "adjustments in the
supply chain, and adjustments in the manufacturing footprint," but it's
"too early to tell" exactly how. He added that the USMCA is "more
complex than the \[agreement\] that it would replace." BDI head Joachim
Lang agreed that it is too soon to tell exactly what the impact will be
on German industry. Trump held a White House press conference on Monday,
October 1, where he and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer both
described the USMCA --- and particularly the new American strategy of
using tariffs as leverage to extract concessions --- as a preview of
what Europe and other trading partners should expect. Lighthizer called
the deal a "paradigm shifting model" that will "serve as a template for
our trade agreements under the Trump Administration in the future."
Trump said openly that "without tariffs, we wouldn't be talking about a
deal." During the press event, Trump highlighted the ongoing dialogue
between the E.U. and U.S. with a mixture of both praise and provocation.
He brought up the new talks as an example of a "successful negotiation,"
but one that never would have begun without his threat to levy "a tax of
20 percent on the millions of Mercedes and BMWs." He also described
President Jean-Claude Juncker as a "great businessperson." The European
Union likely expects Trump to propose similar upper limits on imports of
cars and auto parts during the current transatlantic negotiation, just
as he did with Mexico and Canada --- which it may be willing to accept,
if set high enough. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that Trump
may also push the E.U. and others to swallow other USMCA provisions ---
for example language discouraging it from forming a free-trade deal with
China. This may be a bigger challenge. Notably, the USMCA does not
resolve the fate of Trump's worldwide steel and aluminum tariffs on
Canada and Mexico (imposed on May 31 and which prompted Canada to
retaliate with tariffs on \$12.8 billion in U.S. exports, and Mexico to
retaliate with tariffs on \$3 billion in American exports). Lighthizer
told a Senate panel in July that a revised NAFTA would include lifting
the tariffs on metals from both nations, but on Monday he said that it
would occur in a later phase of negotiations. For many American
industries, the future benefit of USMCA will not make up for the ongoing
burden of Canadian and Mexican retaliation. We continue to believe that
the [USMCA faces a steep climb]{.underline} in Congress. Senator John
[Cornyn]{.underline} (R-Texas), the second ranking Senate Republican,
spoke positively about the agreement on the Senate floor, but
[said]{.underline} on Wednesday that [passing legislation to implement
the deal would be "an uphill fight."]{.underline} Other key lawmakers
have reacted with a mix of guarded optimism and skepticism. Republicans
such as Senator Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) are suggesting that Congress
push to approve an implementing bill during the "lame duck" window
between the midterm election and January 3, 2019. This would mean that
Congress would have to pass the bill in December --- after the deal is
signed on November 30, but likely before the required economic impact
statement of the deal is finished. This would be an unprecedented move
and would likely mean that the bill would pass on a partisan vote.
[Ultimately]{.underline}, we believe that [Trump will need to expend

[At stake for the president and]{.underline} American l[awmakers is the
fate of a trading bloc with about \$1 trillion in annual
shipments]{.underline} that's lifted some industries while decimating
the workers in others. For Democrats in particular, the deal provides an
opening to demand concessions that favor unions and include a possible
infrastructure investment package. **["There's no question that there is
a path to passage]{.underline}**," said Edward Alden, senior fellow at
the Council on Foreign Relations. "The key for Democrats is whether the
labor unions are prepared at least not to oppose the USMCA. Without
active labor opposition, there will be a significant group of Democrats
prepared to vote for this." Fractious Politics Signed in Buenos Aires on
Nov. 30 after more than a year of intense negotiations, [**USMCA is
the** biggest achievement in Trump's trade agenda and its **survival
depends on whether the president can steer the agreement through
fractious domestic politics**]{.underline}. Even though it's been signed
by all three countries, it still must be ratified by each nation's
legislature \-- and particularly in the U.S., that's where it can go
sideways. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has the tough task
of convincing his boss that he needs to exercise patience with lawmakers
who eventually must approve his deal but are requiring changes.
Lighthizer doesn't have much wiggle room to satisfy a wide range of
concerns. He says he's willing to address demands through the
implementing bill that Congress will vote on, though he ruled out
reopening the deal for negotiations.

### 2NC Veto Override Ext

#### The president would veto the plan

Congressional Use of Other Legislation

[Congress can]{.underline} also [block]{.underline} or modify [a
proposed sale of major defense equipment, or defense articles and
services, if it uses the regular legislative process to pass legislation
prohibiting]{.underline} or modifying [the sale or]{.underline}
prohibiting [delivery of the equipment to the recipient
country]{.underline}. While it is generally presumed that Congress will
await formal notification under Section 36(b) or 36(c) of the AECA
before acting in opposition to a prospective arms sale, it is clear that
a properly drafted law could block or modify an arms sale transaction at
any time---including before a formal AECA notification was submitted or
after the 30-day AECA statutory notification period had expired--- so
long as the items have not been delivered to the recipient country.
Congressional use of its lawmaking power regarding arms sales is not
constrained by the AECA reporting requirements. [In order to prevail,
however, Congress must be capable of overriding a presidential veto of
this legislation, for the President would presumably veto a bill that
blocked his wish to make the arms sale in question]{.underline}. [This
means, in practical terms, that to impose its view on the President,
Congress must be capable of securing a two-thirds majority of those
present and voting in both houses]{.underline}. There are potentially
important practical advantages, however, to prohibiting or modifying a
sale, if Congress seeks to do so, prior to the date when the formal
contract with the foreign government is signed---which could occur at
any time after the statutory 30-day period. These likely advantages
include (1) limiting political damage to bilateral relations that could
result from signing a sales contract and later nullifying it with a new
law; and (2) avoiding financial liabilities which the United States
Government might face for breaking a valid sales contract. The
legislative vehicle designed to prohibit or modify a specific arms sale
can take a variety of forms, ranging from a rider to any appropriation
or authorization bill to a freestanding bill or joint resolution. The
only essential features that the vehicle must have are (1) that it is
legislation passed by both houses of Congress and presented to the
President for his signature or veto and, (2) that it contains an express
restriction on the sale and/or the delivery of military equipment
(whether it applies to specific items or general categories) to a
specific country or countries.

#### Congress has NEVER blocked an Arms Sale -- throw normal means out the window -- the plan is unprecedented in nature

**KERR 4/1** (Paul K.; Specialist in Nonproliferation -- Congressional
Research Service, "Arms Sales: Congressional Review Process,"
https://fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/RL31675.pdf)ww

In summary, [in the absence of a strong majority in both houses of
Congress supporting legislation to block]{.underline} or modify [a
prospective arms sale]{.underline}, [the practical and procedural
obstacles]{.underline} to passing such a law---whether a freestanding
measure or one within the AECA framework---[are great]{.underline}.
[Even if Congress can pass the requisite legislation]{.underline} to
work its will on an arms sale, [the President need only veto it and
secure the support of one-third plus one of the Members of either the
Senate or the House to have the veto sustained and permit the
sale]{.underline}. It should be noted that [Congress has never
successfully blocked a proposed arms sale by use of a joint resolution
of disapproval]{.underline}, although it has come close to doing so (see
section below for selected examples). Nevertheless, Congress has---by
expressing strong opposition to prospective arms sales, during
consultations with the executive branch---affected the timing and the
composition of some arms sales, and may have dissuaded the President
from formally proposing certain arms sales.

#### A veto override is uniquely necessary in the Trump era

**FORD 6/11** (Matt; Staff Writer -- New Republic, "A Farewell to Arms
Deals,"
https://newrepublic.com/article/154160/trump-arms-deals-executive-power-democrats-congress)ww

If there's one thing at which the Trump administration excels, it's
finding arcane provisions in federal law to implement its policy vision.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced last month that the U.S. would
use emergency powers to bypass Congress on 22 arms deals with the Saudi
government and other neighboring Arab states. "We presented some of
these sales almost 18 months ago to Congress, but it has failed to act,"
he wrote on Twitter. "The U.S. is, and must remain, a reliable security
partner in the Gulf and to our allies around the world. It's fundamental
to our national security." A bipartisan group of senators, led by
Connecticut Democrat Chris Murphy and Indiana Republican Todd Young,
said on Sunday that they would introduce congressional resolutions to
block a slate of U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia. The move reflects a
growing unease on Capitol Hill with the Trump administration's close
relationship with Riyadh, as well as concerns about U.S. involvement in
the kingdom's destructive war in Yemen. Like so many other disputes in
the Trump era, the clash also underscores the imbalance of power in
Washington---one that long predates the sitting president. A reckoning
with the Trump era also requires a reckoning with the amount of power
that Congress has ceded to the executive branch over the past
half-century. It's the thread that connects most every major showdown
Trump instigates, from the Muslim-targeted travel ban one week after he
took office through his tariff threats with Mexico last week. Democratic
presidential candidates, as they compete for policy supremacy, ought to
craft solutions to this aggressive growth of executive power. On the
matter of foreign arms sales, one of them already has. Pompeo cited [the
Arms Export Control Act]{.underline} to justify the administration's
move, which [includes a provision that allows the president to bypass
congressional review]{.underline} if his administration determines that
"an emergency exists which requires the proposed sale in the national
security interest of the United States." What's striking is how
perfunctory the restrictions are in the first place: [If Congress wants
to block a particular arms sale, lawmakers would need to pass a
resolution of disapproval by a two-thirds majority in both chambers to
overcome the president's likely veto]{.underline}. [Traditional
Washington comity largely obscured this weakness, since the White House
would typically limit or scrap an arms deal if faced with enough
congressional criticism]{.underline}. [In the hands of a president with
an iron grip on one party and nothing but contempt for the other, it's
more of a blank check than a meaningful one]{.underline}. The raft of
moribund Cold War--era laws that give the president emergency powers in
certain circumstances, coupled with Trump's extraordinarily broad
definition of when they can be invoked, and the Supreme Court's supine
deference to those interpretations, has been a disastrous recipe for
American governance. Part of the problem stems from INS v. Chadha, a
Supreme Court decision handed down decades ago. It's an unusual case.
After Jagdish Rai Chadha's student visa expired in 1972, U.S.
immigration officials let the Kenyan-born South Asian man stay in the
country because of dangerous racial tensions in Kenya. In 1975, however,
the House of Representatives overrode that determination, effectively
ordering Chadha and five other foreign nationals to be deported. He
filed a lawsuit to challenge a provision of U.S. immigration law that
granted each chamber of Congress that power. In a landmark 7--2 ruling
in 1983, the Supreme Court sided with Chadha and effectively struck down
the legislative veto. Chief Justice Warren Burger, writing for the
majority, said that the provision in question was "essentially
legislative in purpose and effect." As a result, it violated the
Constitution's bicameralism requirement by allowing one chamber of
Congress to undertake a legislative act on its own. More importantly,
the court ruled that such vetoes violate the Constitution's requirement
that all legislation be presented to the president for his signature or
veto. Justice Byron White took the rare step of reading his dissent from
the bench, signaling his deep disapproval of the court's decision.
"Today's decision strikes down in one fell swoop provisions in more laws
enacted by Congress than the court has cumulatively invalidated in its
history," he wrote. He argued that his colleagues had insisted on a
separation of powers far stricter than what the Framers had envisioned,
one ill-suited for the modern era of the administrative state. "To be
sure, the President may have preferred unrestricted power," White wrote,
"but that could be precisely why Congress thought it essential to retain
a check on the exercise of delegated authority." What would happen next?
White wrote that without the legislative veto, lawmakers faced a
"Hobson's choice." Congress could write narrow laws that delegated
little authority, "leaving itself with a hopeless task of writing laws
with the requisite specificity to cover endless special circumstances
across the entire policy landscape." Or it could "abdicate its lawmaking
function to the Executive Branch and independent agencies" by writing
broad laws for civil servants to flesh out later. "To choose the former
leaves major national problems unresolved; to opt for the latter risks
unaccountable policymaking by those not elected to fill that role,"
White wrote. Lawmakers quickly realized how the court's decision would
reshape their relations with the White House. Among them was Delaware
Senator Joe Biden, then a junior member of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee and now a presidential candidate. He pointed to two areas
where the justices had upended years of compromise between the two
branches: U.S. military involvement under the War Powers Resolution, and
arms sales to foreign governments. "The Supreme Court's decision has
shattered a careful and workable accommodation between Congress and the
Executive, a development that, in my opinion, threatens our ability to
fashion a foreign policy that is consistent, coherent, and safe," he
wrote in a 1984 Syracuse Law Review article. For arms sales, Biden's
solution was to invert the legal mechanism in question. Rather than
giving Congress an opportunity to stop each sale before it took effect,
his bill would have required the White House to seek affirmative support
from lawmakers first. "Under a joint resolution of approval, of course,
a sale cannot go through until it is approved by both houses and signed
by the President," he wrote. "That can take up a lot of Senate and House
time, but it is the only way for Congress to retain the same degree of
control we had over arms sales before Chadha." This maneuver would
remove the mathematical disadvantage faced by lawmakers: the president's
veto power. "[Under a joint resolution of disapproval, Congress can get
its way only if it has enough votes to override a presidential
veto]{.underline}," Biden explained. "[So instead of needing fifty-one
senators' votes to defeat an arms sale we would need sixty-seven, plus
two-thirds of the House of Representatives]{.underline}." [In other
words, so long as the president can muster the support of one-third of
one chamber of Congress, lawmakers are generally powerless to halt
controversial arms sales to foreign powers]{.underline}. Democratic
lawmakers could theoretically introduce a bill like the one proposed by
Biden more than 30 years ago. But like the resolutions of disapproval
themselves, [any measure that would constrain the president's power over
arms sales will almost certainly be vetoed by Trump
himself]{.underline}. Only a new president can reverse this tide. Every
Democratic presidential candidate will face questions over whether they
should use the executive powers carved out by Trump and his
predecessors, or repudiate them. Many candidates seem inclined to do the
former. But when it comes to selling high-tech weaponry to dubious
foreign governments, without meaningful legislative checks, the answer
to that question should be easy.

#### Veto override is necessary -- the presumption is the president will veto

**KERR 4/1** (Paul K.; Specialist in Nonproliferation -- Congressional
Research Service, "Arms Sales: Congressional Review Process,"
https://fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/RL31675.pdf)ww

Congressional Disapproval by Joint Resolution

[Although Congress has more than one legislative option it can use to
block or modify an arms sale, one option explicitly set out in law for
blocking a proposed arms sale is the use of a joint resolution of
disapproval]{.underline} as provided for in Section 36(b) of the AECA.
Under that law, the formal notification is legally required to be
submitted to the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and
the Speaker of the House. The Speaker has routinely referred these
notifications to the House Foreign Affairs Committee as the committee of
jurisdiction. As a courtesy, the Defense Department has submitted a copy
of the statutory notification to the House Foreign Affairs Committee
when that notification is submitted to the Speaker of the House. Under
this option, after receiving a statutory Section 36(b) notification from
the executive branch, opponents of the arms sale would introduce joint
resolutions in the House and Senate drafted so as to forbid by law the
sale of the items specified in the formal sale notification(s) submitted
to Congress. If no Member introduces such a measure, the AECA's
provisions expediting congressional action, discussed below, do not take
effect. The next step would be committee hearings in both houses on the
arms sale proposal. If a majority of either the House or the Senate
committee supported the joint resolution of disapproval, they would
report it to their respective chamber in accordance with its rules.
Following this, efforts would be made to seek floor consideration of the
resolution. Senate Procedures At this point, it is important to take
note of procedures crafted to expedite the consideration of arms sales
resolutions of disapproval. Since 1976, Section 36(b)(2) of the AECA has
stipulated that consideration of any resolution of disapproval in the
Senate under Section 36(b)(1) of the AECA shall be "in accordance with
the provisions of Section 601(b) of the International Security
Assistance and Arms Export Control Act of 1976" (P.L. 94-329, 90 Stat.
729). Since 1980, this stipulation has also applied to resolutions of
disapproval in the Senate relating to commercially licensed arms sales
under Section 36(c)(1) of the AECA. The purpose of Section 601(b) was to
establish rules to facilitate timely consideration of any resolution of
disapproval in the Senate. The rules set forth in Section 601(b)
supersede the standing rules of the Senate and include the following: 
Give the committee with jurisdiction \[the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee\] 10 calendar days from the date a resolution of disapproval
is referred to it to report back to the Senate its recommendation on any
such resolution (certain adjournment periods are excluded from
computation of the 10 days);  Make it in order for a Senator favoring a
disapproval resolution to move to discharge the committee from further
consideration of the matter if the committee fails to report back to the
Senate by the end of the 10 calendar days it is entitled to review the
resolution (the AECA expressly permits a discharge motion after 5
calendar days for sales to NATO, NATO countries, Japan, Australia, South
Korea, Israel, and New Zealand);  Make the discharge motion privileged,
limit floor debate on the motion to one hour, and preclude efforts to
amend or to reconsider the vote on such a motion;  Make the motion to
proceed to consider a resolution of disapproval privileged and preclude
efforts to amend or to reconsider the vote on such motion;  Limit the
overall time for debate on the resolution of disapproval to 10 hours and
preclude efforts to amend or recommit the resolution of disapproval; 
Limit the time (one hour) to be used in connection with any debatable
motion or appeal; provide that a motion to further limit debate on a
resolution of disapproval, debatable motion, or appeal is not debatable.
The Senate is constitutionally empowered to amend its rules or to effect
a rule change at any time. The fact that an existing rule is in Section
601 of the International Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Act
of 1976 is not an obstacle to changing it by Senate action alone should
the Senate seek to do so. House Floor Procedures12 The House of
Representatives is directed by Sections 36(b)(3) and 36(c)(3)(B) of the
AECA to consider a motion to proceed to the consideration of a joint
resolution disapproving an arms sale reported to it by the appropriate
House committee as "highly privileged." Generally, this means that the
resolution will be given precedence over most other legislative business
of the House, and may be called up on the floor without a special rule
reported by the Rules Committee. Unlike for the Senate, however, the
AECA contains no provision for discharge of the House committee if it
does not report on the joint resolution. If reported and called up, the
measure will be considered in the Committee of the Whole, meaning that
amendments can be offered under the "five-minute rule." Nevertheless,
amendments to joint resolutions disapproving arms sales have apparently
never been offered in the House. The Rules Committee usually sets the
framework for floor consideration of major legislation in the House of
Representatives, however, and could do so for a joint resolution of
disapproval. Upon receiving a request for a rule to govern consideration
of such a resolution, the House Rules Committee could set a time limit
for debate, exclude any amendments to, and waive any points of order
against the resolution. If the House adopted the rule reported by the
committee, it would govern the manner in which the legislation would be
considered, superseding the statutory provision. Final Congressional
Action [After a joint resolution is passed by both the House and the
Senate, the measure would next be sent to the President. Once this
legislation reaches the President, presumably he would veto it in a
timely manner. Congress would then face the task of obtaining a
two-thirds majority in both houses to override the veto and impose its
position on the President]{.underline}.

#### Trump certainly vetos the aff\-\--fiat means congress overrides it.

Notably, there was initially a [parliamentary
question](https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/bipartisan-senate-group-seek-block-saudi-arms-sales-trump-administration-tries-avoid-congressional-review)
as to whether **[joint resolutions on arms sales]{.underline}** moved
forward under the emergency exception could qualify for the Section 601
expedited procedures---an ineligibility, perhaps, that the Trump
administration had been relying on. The Senate parliamentarian appears
to have resolved this question in favor of the resolutions' sponsors, as
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has since
[confirmed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-10/senate-republicans-join-in-rebuke-of-trump-over-saudi-arms-sales)
that a vote to move the resolutions out of committee could take place as
soon as next week. Moreover, unlike concurrent resolutions in the
original AECA, any joint resolutions that are enacted into law through
these procedures will be free-standing legislation with independent
force of law. As a result, the resolutions' directive that each of the
22 specified transactions "is prohibited" should still be binding on the
executive branch. That said, it seems unlikely that any of the joint
resolutions will reach this stage. [Given that each is co-sponsored by
four Republican senators]{.underline}, [they seem to have the minimum
votes necessary to pass the Senate as well as the Democrat-controlled
House]{.underline}. **[But Trump is almost certain to veto
them]{.underline}**, and it seems unlikely that two-thirds of both the
House and the Senate will support an effort to override these vetoes. As
a result, [the outcome here is likely to resemble the outcome of the
Yemen war powers debate, with Trump using his veto to continue to pursue
his **increasingly unpopular Yemen policies** over **bipartisan
objections**]{.underline}. But to arrive here, the Trump administration
will have to weather many more rounds of floor debate that will put
bipartisan objections to the president's Yemen policies on full display
and associate his Republican allies with an increasingly unpopular war.
And the numerous vetoes Trump will have to deploy will no doubt make
clear to what extent he is pursuing those policies without the support
of Congress.

[Trade]{.underline} in general [has become a complicated ideological and
electoral issue]{.underline} since Trump in his 2016 campaign denounced
Nafta as the worst example of globalism run amok with little regard for
U.S. workers. Trump's position sets him apart from free-trade
Republicans, and [it]{.underline} also [creates a dilemma for 2020
Democratic]{.underline} [candidates]{.underline}. [Democrats
traditionally have been more skeptical than Republicans when it comes to
free trade]{.underline}. [The 2020 presidential race]{.underline} also
[squeezes the timing for a vote on the bill to implement the
USMCA]{.underline}. [Lawmakers of both parties have warned that passing
such a deal will be politically tricky in an election year]{.underline}.
[That means the best chance for a vote would be before Congress recesses
in August to avoid typical end-of-the-year budget fights]{.underline},
according to North Carolina Representative Mark Meadows, a close Trump
ally. "Hopefully, we can get together and make sure that happens in the
latter part of July,'' Meadows said on Fox News's "Sunday Morning
Futures.''

[The GOP-led Senate will vote on measures that could **stop** the
**Trump** administration from **pushing through arms sales** to Saudi
Arabia]{.underline} over congressional objections, [according
to]{.underline} Majority Leader Mitch [McConnell]{.underline},
[**potentially tying up Senate floor time** and putting some of the
president's **closest allies at odds** with part of his foreign policy.
Some Republicans]{.underline} have [criticized]{.underline} President
Donald [Trump's decision to push ahead with]{.underline} \$8 billion in
[arms sales]{.underline} to Saudi Arabia and other Mideast countries
[despite congressional opposition]{.underline}. They have also urged
stronger consequences for the kingdom's role in the killing of columnist
Jamal Khashoggi. McConnell said he is "as offended as everyone is by the
behavior of the Saudis on the Khashoggi case," but he warned against
"fracturing the relationship we have with the Saudis \-- one of our best
allies against our Iranian enemies." With Senator Mike Lee joining
Republican Senators Lindsey Graham, Rand Paul and Todd Young in
cosponsoring 22 resolutions to disapprove of the sales, McConnell
acknowledged that the vote will go ahead. However, McConnell said he
supports the underlying arms sales and predicted that the Senate will
not have enough votes to override a Trump veto of Congress's attempt to
stop them. Lawmakers, even Republicans, have been unsettled over Trump's
repeated use of emergency declarations to bypass Congress on matters of
foreign policy, government spending and potentially trade and
immigration. The disagreement over selling defense systems to Saudi
Arabia \-- a traditional U.S. ally \-- is further complicated by
increased tensions in the Middle East as the Trump administration warns
that regional forces associated with Iran have stepped up their threats.
The Democratic-led House will hold a Wednesday hearing to discuss the
arms sale, with testimony from [R. Clarke
Cooper](https://www.state.gov/biographies/r-clarke-cooper/), assistant
secretary for political-military affairs. Cooper will cite signs of
Iranian aggression as justification for approving these deals, according
to excerpts of his prepared testimony. "These sales and the associated
emergency certification are intended to address the military need of our
partners in the face of an urgent regional threat posed by Iran; promote
the vitality of our bilateral relationships by reassuring our partners;
and preserve strategic advantage against near-peer competitors,"
Cooper's advance statement says. 'Deeply Problematic' This argument has
failed to convince Senator Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, who introduced the resolutions last week to
gut the emergency declaration the Trump administration is using to push
the arms sales forward without congressional approval. The resolutions
need 51 votes to be discharged from the Foreign Relations Committee, so
just four Republicans can force a vote if the Senate's 47 Democrats
support the measures. Each resolution provides for 10 hours of debate,
and [**that could tie up the Senate floor for 220 hours** if senators
can't agree to handle the resolutions as one block]{.underline},
according to Menendez.

### \--timing key ext

**ECKELKAMP 6/18** (Margy; Farm Journal, "Time Window To Finalize USMCA
Is Closing,"
https://www.porkbusiness.com/article/time-window-finalize-usmca-closing)ww

On Monday's AgriTalk, Chuck Conner, president and CEO of the National
Council of Farmer Cooperatives (NCFC), said the U.S.-Mexico-Canada
Agreement ([USMCA]{.underline}) has support across agriculture and
[should be an easy decision for Congress to finalize]{.underline}. "If
you\'re an American legislator, there\'s absolutely no reason to be
against this," Conner said. "Farmers need this. And these are tough,
tough times, probably the toughest times on the American farm that
we\'ve seen since the mid-80s. They need these additional markets that
USMCA and other things create." Conner has been at the NCFC for 10
years. Previously he was Deputy Secretary for the USDA in the George W.
Bush administration, and in all he has served more than 25 years in
national and state government. Pulling from his decades of experience,
Conner shared his insights on USMCA, future trade agreements with the
European Union and Japan, and what all of this means for agriculture.
Conner said USMCA will provide better market opportunities for
agriculture in important ways. "This new agreement is really an
agreement that is all about benefiting the United States," he said.
"This agreement resolves those (previous concessions) and breaks through
the barriers of dairy, poultry, biotechnology and a lot of other things
that are critical to American agriculture where we\'ve had problems." As
a particular example of how this will improve U.S. agricultural trade,
Conner points to wheat. "Any kind of wheat that we shipped to Canada, it
almost immediately gets graded as feed wheat. Therefore, it's subject to
lower prices and it\'s a trade barrier," he said. "Yet it has been in
place for a long time and NAFTA did not fix that. The new USMCA I think
will move the ball forward and put us on a path where they will treat
our wheat the same as they do their own wheat in Canada. And that\'s
always been our goal." He also noted that [July 4 is shaping up to be
the next deadline]{.underline} for USMCA to move ahead. "[We are in a
30-day counting period]{.underline} right now where the administration
has sent up what they call their statement of administrative action. And
that\'s basically to alert Congress that [the legislation implementing
USMCA is coming and coming quickly]{.underline}. And so [that 30
days]{.underline} isn't necessarily on the calendar clock, but it
[expires]{.underline} here [around the Fourth of July]{.underline}."
[After that]{.underline} period, he says [Congress has 60 legislative
days to act]{.underline}. "It\'s our hope that Congress will act and as
American agriculture, we are united in trying to persuade Congress to
adopt this because this new agreement is only a benefit to the United
States," he said. According to Conner, [now is the time to get USMCA
finalized]{.underline}. "I don\'t think there will be a USMCA if we
don\'t get this thing done by the end of the year or certainly very
early in 2020. [As we get deep into a presidential election run,
Congress is just not going to do anything as highly controversial as
what USMCA is, and so we\'ve got a few months window here to get this
done]{.underline}," he said. Conner also discussed developing trade with
the European Union and Japan, and he shared his impression of how
important agriculture is to the Trump administration.

Introduction",

[The legislative process is **laborious** and **time-consuming**, and
the **time available**]{.underline} for Senate floor action each year
[is **limited**. Every day devoted to one bill is a day **denied** for
consideration of **other legislation**, and there are **not enough
days** to act on all the bills]{.underline} that Senators and Senate
committees wish to see enacted. Naturally, [the time pressures become
even greater with the approach of deadlines]{.underline} such as the
date for adjournment and the end of the fiscal year. So, for all but the
most important bills, even the threat of a filibuster can be a potent
weapon. Before a bill reaches the floor or while it is being debated,
its supporters often seek ways to accommodate the concerns of opponents,
preferring an amended bill that can be passed without protracted debate
to the time, effort, and risks involved in confronting a filibuster or
the threat of one.

"Confirmation Wars and Collateral Damage: Assessing the Impact of
Supreme Court Nominations on Presidential Success in the U.S. Senate,"
pg online @
http://spia.uga.edu/faculty_pages/ajmadonn/Presidential%20Capital.pdf

It is "often overlooked" that presidents "operate in a world they do not
control" (Beckmann 2010, 13). Supreme Court vacancies yield important
(and often unexpected) additions to the president's "to do" list.
Despite the president's power to influence the legislative agenda and
achieve confirmation for his judicial nominees, [unanticipated exogenous
shocks can distract from]{.underline} these [priorities]{.underline}.
[**These** events]{.underline} **[divert lawmakers' efforts to new
concerns at the expense of preexisting agenda items]{.underline}**.
[Exogenous shocks cost]{.underline} president's [**time, resources, and
attention** previously devoted to other endeavors]{.underline}. We
theorize that Supreme Court vacancies and the nominations that follow
function as exogenous shocks to the presidential agenda and influence
success in both the legislative arena and the lower court confirmation
process.8 [Political scientists have established that exogenous events
influence]{.underline} presidential [success]{.underline}, but their
interest has been devoted primarily to major domestic or national
security crises (Beckmann 2010; Lebo and Cassino 2007). Those events
often, but not always, demand immediate and ongoing attention. Despite
the substantive differences between Supreme Court nominations and other
types of exogenous events, we argue that they share many of their
characteristics. Once a Supreme Court justice leaves office or declares
her intention to do so, the president is responsible for selecting her
successor. The vetting and confirmation processes require presidents'
attention and time, both of which are scarce goods for political elites
(Jones and Baumgartner 2005; Oppenheimer 1985). The amount of time and
political capital spent on a Supreme Court nominee is largely dependent
on the ideology of the president and key legislators (Johnson and
Roberts 2004, 2005). Presidents want to select nominees in line with
their own ideological preferences, but must take into account the
preferences of key senators (Moraski and Shipan 1999). The statement by
Senator Reid suggests that Supreme Court nominations can distract
legislators despite rational selection behavior by presidents. As a
result, Supreme Court nominees can occupy time that would be allocated
to different priorities. **[Time is a valuable commodity in the
Senate]{.underline}**. [Its value has increased as the number of bills
introduced has grown, obstruction has become commonplace, and party
polarization has increased]{.underline}. In other words, [senatorial
time has been filled by two major sources: the sheer volume of
bills]{.underline} (many of which are trivial but must be considered)
**[and more extensive time spent debating the bills that are
controversial]{.underline}**. [Eventually, these increased demands on
the time of Congress have policy consequences because sessions expire
before important legislation can be considered and passed]{.underline}
(Oppenheimer 1985). [Majority party leadership in the Senate lacks the
ability to issue restrictive floor rules and small groups or individuals
from either party can obstruct the legislative process]{.underline}.
Despite the presence of a cloture rule allowing three-fifths of the
chamber to end debate, [incidents of obstruction have increased fairly
dramatically]{.underline} in the latter half of the twentieth century
(Binder 1997; Koger 2010; Wawro and Schickler 2004, 2006). [Even when
the Senate majority can muster a supermajority for cloture, the process
is still fairly time consuming]{.underline}. The vote on a cloture
petition can occur only after it lies over for two calendar days. Then,
an additional 30 hours of debate and amending activity can occur before
a final vote is taken on the measure. Given the large number of judicial
nominations, moving cloture on all or many of them is untenable. As
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) noted in 2010, "there isn't
enough time in the world -- the Senate world, at least -- to move
cloture on every one of these \[judicial nominations\]" (Wilson and
Murray 2010).

#### USMCA is key to the economy -- trade boosts multiple critical sectors

Coalition and a former executive director of the Republican Governors
Association, (\"Opinion: Trump\'s trade deal with Canada and Mexico is a
huge win for Americans, and it\'s time for Congress to pass it,\"

https://www.businessinsider.com/opinion-congress-trump-usmca-canada-mexico-trade-deal-2019-5,
accessed 6-16-2019)

[Free trade is at the heart of the US economy]{.underline}. Each year,
our companies sell more than \$2.5 trillion worth of goods and services
to customers around the world. [Of]{.underline} those
[exports]{.underline}, [nearly \$300 billion worth of exports go to
Mexico and another \$360 billion]{.underline} worth [go to
Canada]{.underline}, **[two key markets]{.underline}** for US
enterprise. The importance of these markets is the reason the US entered
into a trade agreement with our North American neighbors 25 years ago
and why President Donald Trump and his administration signed a new deal,
a better deal --- the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA.
And now [it\'s time for Congress to reaffirm **how important trade**
with **Mexico** and **Canada** is **for the US economy**]{.underline}
and pass the USMCA. Our country recognizes the importance of these
markets. A quarter of a century ago, the US entered into a trade
agreement with our North American neighbors that helped to level the
playing field and reduce barriers to trade for American job creators.
But 25 years later, that trade agreement is no longer the best agreement
for US businesses. That\'s why Trump and his administration signed the
USMCA. As it goes in Washington, there are lawmakers on both sides of
the aisle who are not 100% pleased with the agreement. To me, that means
the Trump administration negotiated a balanced agreement that deserves
support from all members of Congress. The USMCA updates the old
agreement and ensures that American workers and families are put first.
[This is also a welcome agreement for industries that depend on free,
fair, rules-based trade with Canada and Mexico]{.underline}. America\'s
**[farmers]{.underline}**, **[ranchers]{.underline}**, **[auto
manufacturers]{.underline}**, [and **small businesses** are **set to
gain**]{.underline} once the USMCA is signed into law. [According to
the]{.underline} US **[I]{.underline}**nternational
**[T]{.underline}**rade **[C]{.underline}**ommission, [the USMCA will
create **176,000** US **jobs** and **add** over **\$68 billion** to the
**US economy**]{.underline} --- that is, in addition to the 12 million
jobs already in the US that are supported by trade with Canada and
Mexico. [This]{.underline} positive [report]{.underline} [suggests that
pro-growth policies promoting free, fair, and enforceable trade are a
win for American workers and job creators alike]{.underline}. Supporters
of the USMCA recognize that [this agreement contains provisions that
will help make American job creators **more competitive**]{.underline}.
[For **agriculture**]{.underline}, those [provisions provide increased
access to Canadian]{.underline} dairy [markets]{.underline}. [For
**manufacturing**, the USMCA establishes requirements that promote
American-made **cars** and **machinery**]{.underline} [as well as **new
worker protections**]{.underline} [to ensure American factory jobs do
not get **shipped overseas**]{.underline}. The economic boost comes from
a number of provisions in the USMCA that will help American businesses
and consumers, including increased access to Canadian dairy markets for
farmers and requirements that promote American-made cars and machinery
for manufacturers. [The USMCA also established new rules around
e-commerce]{.underline}, [making it easier for American small businesses
to connect and sell to customers in Mexico and Canada]{.underline}. The
USMCA is [also a winning proposition for]{.underline} American
[innovators because it strengthens **i**ntellectual-**p**roperty

#### USMCA key to the economy -- IP protections

Congress will soon decide whether to ratify the [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates-[M]{.underline}exico-[C]{.underline}anada
[A]{.underline}greement, the trade deal that would update NAFTA in
several ways. Most importantly, the new pact [would significantly
strengthen intellectual property rights]{.underline}. [It\'s hard to
overstate the value of IP rights to America\'s economy]{.underline}. The
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office reports that [IP-intensive industries
account for 45.5 million U.S. jobs and more than \$6 trillion in
GDP]{.underline}. [Without strong IP rights, the industries that enhance
our lives would cease to function]{.underline}. [Congress can set the
stage for years of job creation and economic growth by
ratifying]{.underline} the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement
([USMCA]{.underline}). [Innovation isn\'t cheap or easy]{.underline}.
This is especially true in my industry of biopharmaceuticals. It costs
an average of \$2.6 billion and often takes more than a decade to
develop just one new medicine. By patenting their drug designs,
biopharmaceutical firms can prevent rivals from creating knockoff
medicines for a limited time. That enables innovative firms to earn a
return on investment and plow the revenues into new lines of research,
leading to yet more innovation. Today, [the biopharmaceutical sector
supports 4.7 million American jobs and contributes more than \$1.3
trillion a year to the economy \-- none of which would be possible
without our nation\'s strong IP protections]{.underline}. [Other
IP-intensive sectors have similarly impressive statistics]{.underline}.
[Copyright industries support 5.7 million jobs, while the tech industry
employs 6.7 million]{.underline}. Importantly, [these creative
industries produce the majority of American exports, which help reduce
the trade deficit]{.underline}. [These sectors account for about \$840
billion in merchandise exports and another \$80 billion in service
exports annually]{.underline}. [The USMCA contains numerous intellectual
property provisions]{.underline}. For instance, the deal would create a
Committee on Intellectual Property Rights. Representatives from each
country would work together to boost enforcement of IP rights and
improve transparency in issues concerning trade secrets. That\'s a
[necessary]{.underline} reform [to prevent IP theft]{.underline}. By one
estimate, [the sale of counterfeit American goods costs our economy \$29
billion a year. Stolen trade secrets, meanwhile, cost businesses and
workers \$180 billion]{.underline}. The USMCA also includes critical
protections for sophisticated drugs known as \"biologics,\" which
represent some of the most promising cures of the future. [Policies like
these will preserve the incentive for American individuals and companies
to innovate and protect them from IP theft]{.underline}. American,
Canadian, and Mexican leaders already finalized the terms of the USMCA
back in November, but Congress hasn\'t yet approved the deal. There\'s
little reason to wait. [The USMCA would give the nation\'s most
innovative and creative industries the security they need to create jobs
and grow our economy]{.underline}. Passing it is a no-brainer.

on to what you've got. [USMCA will **boost economic growth** by
**improving the market access** guaranteed for U.S.
businesses.]{.underline} For example, the agreement further opens the
Canadian market to U.S. agricultural exports such as dairy products,
poultry, and wine. [U.S. farmers and ranchers have faced five years of
declining commodity prices,]{.underline} [so USMCA's improved market
access is more than welcome]{.underline}. And [make no mistake: **These
are growth markets**]{.underline}. [U.S. exports]{.underline} to Mexico
and Canada [have grown more over the past decade than sales to any other
country]{.underline}. In each case, exports have expanded by more than
\$100 billion annually. **[No other market comes close]{.underline}**.
In fact, Mexico and Canada accounted for about 40% of the growth in U.S.
goods exports in dollar terms over the past decade. In particular, USMCA
promises growth for America's small and midsized exporters. Canada and
Mexico are the top two export destinations for U.S. small and
medium-size enterprises, more than 120,000 of which sell their goods and
services in our two North American neighbors. [When an American small
business starts exporting, it's almost always to Canada or
Mexico.]{.underline}

Today, nearly six out of 10 American jobs created by exports of digital
services are jobs outside the tech industry. Sectors like agriculture,
health care, and manufacturing make up a large part of the 5 million
total jobs and \$1.35 trillion in annual productivity of the digital
economy, according to the Internet Association. As a result, it [is now
more important than ever to ensure the **rules of the road** on the
**digital highway** are modernized and clear.]{.underline} [That's
why]{.underline} [President
[Trump]{.underline}](https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump) and U.S.
Trade Ambassador [Robert
Lighthizer](https://thehill.com/people/robert-bob-lighthizer) [spent
countless hours negotiating the creation]{.underline} of a new "digital
chapter" in [the]{.underline} updated proposed trade agreement with
Mexico and Canada -- the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement
([USMCA]{.underline}). [The USMCA includes a host of new benefits
for]{.underline} American workers, families, and [the
economy.]{.underline} And [the changes impacting the **digital economy**
are among the most important.]{.underline} [It will, for the **first
time**, prohibit the imposition of customs duties]{.underline}, fees, or
other charges on [**digital products** traded
electronically]{.underline}. [It will also safeguard **cross-border data
flows**]{.underline}. [USMCA is the first trade agreement to ensure the
**free flow of data for all sectors**.]{.underline} Businesses of all
sizes, across [all sectors]{.underline}, [**will benefit**
from]{.underline} the free and [safe flow of information. The trade pact
**prohibits data localization** requirements]{.underline} that force
businesses to use or locate computing facilities in a specific country
or territory as a condition for conducting business. Additionally,
[USMCA streamlines customs processes to **support
e-commerce**]{.underline}. As the digital economy continues to evolve
and grow, modernizing the mechanics of how goods flow between countries
in North America is critical. [The new agreement will help **speed the
growth** of **e-commerce.**]{.underline} Finally, [as this sector
continues to evolve and expand, enhanced data protection becomes even
more important.]{.underline} The proposed agreement encourages, for the
first time, data privacy and cybersecurity collaboration. USMCA requires
all three countries to adopt measures to comply with each other's data
privacy laws. USMCA also promotes a collaborative, risk-based approach
and adoption of industry best practices to keep networks and services
secure. These new digital provisions and protections are both timely and
important. A lot has changed in the 25 years since NAFTA was signed into
law. Back then, folks didn't have cell phones, internet access required
a dial-up connection, and movies had to be rented in VHS format. Today,
we live in an interconnected world driven by rapidly evolving digital
technologies and capabilities. We do our work on lightning-fast
computers, interact through mobile phones, and buy goods with a single
click. [These changes have benefited workers and consumers across every
sector.]{.underline} It has created [**countless jobs** and **grown
wages**]{.underline}, all while improving Americans' day-to-day lives.
It has made it easier for farmers to find customers, [leading to
**increased revenue** and **production**]{.underline}. It has overhauled
logistics entirely, empowering manufacturers across the country to be
able to expand and grow, and it is even forcing health care providers to
adapt to new standards. Imagine the potential if [we can make our
digital economy even more competitive on a global scale]{.underline} --
making our products more affordable while simultaneously [expanding
markets for our local job creators.]{.underline} **[That is what USMCA
sets out to achieve]{.underline}**. And that's why the agreement's new
digital provisions are so important. Yet, unfortunately, USMCA is
currently being held hostage by the partisan political circus in
Washington. Delaying approval of the trade pact hits the pocketbooks of
the workers and families in North Carolina and across the nation. Folks
across all sectors -- from farmers and factory floor workers to
programmers and engineers -- are losing out. Far too much hangs in the
balance. USMCA will lead to more jobs, larger paychecks, and cheaper
prices for American consumers. It provides a much-needed foundation for
the expansion of free and fair digital trade and investment in
innovative products and services. And it creates a framework for a
cutting edge, 21st-century economy. It's time for Washington to buck up
and get this agreement over the finish line. We have before us [a once
in a generation opportunity to define a **new global standard** in
**digital trade**]{.underline}, one that [positions the United States as
the **world leader** in the **digital economy**.]{.underline} We can't

#### Slow growth encourages revisionism\-\--great power war.

[Geopolitical ambitions could reduce economic interdependence even
further]{.underline}.120 [Russia and China have territorial and
quasi-territorial ambitions beyond their recognized borders, and
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has
attempted to counter what it sees as **revisionist
behavior**]{.underline} by both countries. [In a **low-growth world**,
it is possible that leaders of either country would choose to prioritize
their **nationalist ambitions** over economic growth]{.underline}. More
generally, [it could be that the expectation of future gains from
interdependence---rather than existing levels of
interdependence---constrains great power bellicosity]{.underline}.121
[If great powers expect that the future benefits of international trade
and investment will wane, then commercial **constraints on revisionist
behavior will lessen**]{.underline}. All else equal, [this increases the
likelihood of **great power conflict** going forward]{.underline}.

#### Trump is a unique risk\-\--psychology proves.

**Foster 16**---Professor of international studies and political science
at the Virginia Military Institute \[Dennis, "Would President Trump go
to war to divert attention from problems at home?" The Washington Post,
19 Dec,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/12/19/yes-trump-might-well-go-to-war-to-divert-attention-from-problems-at-home/?utm_term=.fd514cf55315>,

[If the U.S. economy tanks]{.underline}, should we [expect]{.underline}
Donald [**Trump** to engage in a **diversionary war**]{.underline}?
Since the age of Machiavelli, [analysts]{.underline} have [expected
world leaders to launch international conflicts to deflect popular
attention away from problems at home]{.underline}. [By stirring up
feelings of patriotism, leaders might escape the political costs
o]{.underline}f scandal, unpopularity --- or [a poorly performing
economy]{.underline}. One often-cited example of diversionary war in
modern times is [Argentina's]{.underline} 19[82]{.underline} [invasion
of the Falklands]{.underline}, which several (though not all) [political
scientists attribute to the junta's desire to divert]{.underline} the
people's [attention from a disastrous economy]{.underline}. In a 2014
article, Jonathan Keller and I argued that whether [U.S. presidents
engage in diversionary conflicts depends in part on their psychological
traits]{.underline} --- how they frame the world, process information
and develop plans of action. [Certain traits **predispose** leaders to
more **belligerent** behavior]{.underline}. Do words translate into
foreign policy action? One way to identify these traits is content
analyses of leaders' rhetoric. The more leaders use certain types of
verbal constructs, the more likely they are to possess traits that lead
them to use military force. For one, [conceptually simplistic leaders
view the world in "black and white" terms; they develop unsophisticated
solutions to problems and are largely insensitive to risks]{.underline}.
Similarly, distrustful leaders tend to exaggerate threats and rely on
aggression to deal with threats. [Distrustful leaders typically favor
military action and are confident in their ability to wield it
effectively]{.underline}. [Thus, when faced with]{.underline}
politically damaging problems that are hard to solve --- such as [a
faltering economy]{.underline} --- [leaders who are both distrustful and
simplistic are less likely to put together complex, direct
responses]{.underline}. [Instead, they develop **simplistic but risky
"solutions"** that divert popular attention from the problem,
utilizing]{.underline} the tools with which they are most comfortable
and confident (**[military force]{.underline}**). Based on our analysis
of the rhetoric of previous U.S. presidents, we found that presidents
whose language appeared more simplistic and distrustful, such as Harry
Truman, Dwight Eisenhower and George W. Bush, were more likely to use
force abroad in times of rising inflation and unemployment. By contrast,
John F. Kennedy and Bill Clinton, whose rhetoric pegged them as more
complex and trusting, were less likely to do so. What about Donald
Trump? Since Donald Trump's election, many commentators have expressed
concern about how he will react to new challenges and whether he might
make quick recourse to military action. For example, the Guardian's
George Monbiot has argued that political realities will stymie Trump's
agenda, especially his promises regarding the economy. Then, rather than
risk disappointing his base, [Trump might try to rally public opinion to
his side via military action]{.underline}. [I sampled Trump's campaign
rhetoric, **analyzing 71,446 words** **across 24 events**]{.underline}
from January 2015 to December 2016. Using a program for measuring
leadership traits in rhetoric, [I estimated what Trump's words may tell
us about his level of distrust and conceptual complexity]{.underline}.
The graph below shows Trump's level of distrust compared to previous
presidents. [These results are startling]{.underline}. [Nearly 35
percent of Trump's references to outside groups paint them as harmful to
himself, his allies and friends, and causes that are important to
him]{.underline} --- a percentage almost twice the previous high. The
data suggest that Americans have elected [a leader who]{.underline}, if
his campaign rhetoric is any indication, [will be **historically
unparalleled among modern presidents** in his active suspicion of those
unlike himself and his inner circle, and those who disagree with his
goals]{.underline}. As a candidate, Trump also scored second-lowest
among presidents in conceptual complexity. Compared to earlier
presidents, he used more words and phrases that indicate less
willingness to see multiple dimensions or ambiguities in the
decision-making environment. These include words and phrases like
"absolutely," "greatest" and "without a doubt." A possible implication
for military action I took these data on Trump and plugged them into the
statistical model that we developed to predict major uses of force by
the United States from 1953 to 2000. For a president of average distrust
and conceptual complexity, an economic downturn only weakly predicts an
increase in the use of force. But [the **model** would predict that a
president with Trump]{.underline}'s [numbers would respond to **even** a
**minor** economic **downturn** with an increase in the use of
**force**]{.underline}. For example, were the misery index (aggregate
inflation and unemployment) equal to 12 --- about where it stood in
October 2011 --- [the model predicts a president with Trump's
psychological traits would initiate more than one major conflict per
quarter]{.underline}.

[America's status as the world's most vital nation is as **dependent on
its prosperity** as it is on its military might]{.underline} and ability
to project power worldwide. [The federal **government's capacity** to
allocate resources to our armed forces, the **private sector's** ability
to develop beneficial products and technologies, and the satisfaction of
the]{.underline} domestic [public are all **closely tied** to the
continued growth of American wealth]{.underline} at home and abroad.
[This has been proven repeatedly during periods where the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates has [faced its greatest
**existential threats**: Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan were unable to
keep up with the]{.underline} sheer industrial [output of the American
heartland, while the Soviet Empire lost control of its
satellites]{.underline} in great part [due to their desire to benefit
from the Western free market system]{.underline}.¶ Therefore, [the
formulation of a **long-term strategy** that anticipates the potential
disruptions and opportunities of the new global economy is as important
as questions of diplomacy and military strategy]{.underline}. As
[the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates evaluates
how it will face the rapidly changing and increasingly interconnected
world of the 21st century, it [**must** take into account its **economic
interests** as well as the potential economic costs associated with
achieving its political objectives]{.underline}.¶ Since the beginning of
the Cold War, [America's **unparalleled** ability to influence countries
through nonviolent means has been **critical** to the **preservation of
global stability**]{.underline}. The most relevant example of this in
our history is the Marshall Plan, which leveraged American capital to
provide a devastated post-War Europe with almost 120 billion dollars
(adjusted for inflation) in aid. This aid was critical to preventing the
spread of Soviet influence into Western Europe, and laid the foundation
for an economically strong region stretching from Portugal to Austria
that has been free from inter-state conflict since 1945. [Because of the
pragmatic exercise of economic influence, the]{.underline}
[E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion [is now our strongest ally as
well as our largest trading partner]{.underline}.¶ Worldwide, the
liberal economic system that the United States has promoted through
international trade organizations like the WTO has contributed to
unprecedented economic cohesion between states. When countries are tied
together in the mutually beneficial exchange of goods, the opportunity
cost of war goes up significantly, making political leaders much more
likely to de-escalate and rely on nonviolent means to resolve
conflicts.¶ [Our **economy** also plays a **key role** in helping the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates **[deal with states that
threaten stability]{.underline}**. [The American **ability to impose
sanctions** has been a **formidable tool** for discouraging **nuclear
prolif**eration and punishing violators of international
norms]{.underline}. [When more direct means of coercion are required, a
powerful industrial and technological base **enables** the maintenance
of a well-funded and technologically **advanced
military**]{.underline}.¶ [America's advanced 17 trillion-dollar economy
has allowed it to exert the influence that it does in the world
today]{.underline}. [However, our **economic strength** and the skill of
our workforce, which have always underwritten our international
influence, **should not be taken for granted**]{.underline}. [**Rapid
growth in the developing world** means that **American companies** and
workers must now contend in an **increasingly crowded global
marketplace**]{.underline}. In the new "knowledge economy," educating
America's workers and [ensuring that the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[retains its role as an innovation capital
must take the highest priority]{.underline}**. On the business side,
reforming America's institutions and [removing barriers to expansion and
innovation will encourage the companies of the future to make their
start here]{.underline}.

#### Economic dominance prevents global nuclear war.

**Henricksen 17** \-\-- Thomas H. Henricksen, emeritus senior fellow at
the Hoover Institution, Post-American World Order, 23 March 2017,
https://www.hoover.org/research/post-american-world-order

[The emergent world, divided]{.underline} between the United States,
China, and Russia, [points to the new global order. Particularly
worrisome are]{.underline} the [warming relations between Beijing and
Moscow]{.underline}, despite Chinese designs on Siberian lands and
resources. Overcoming a centuries-old rivalry, the recent Sino-Russian
rapprochement compounds Washington's difficulties. Separating Russia
from China, as Kissinger and Nixon did, would be a sensible goal for
President Trump. It has always been a wise recourse to divide one's
adversaries. Besides, the United States and Russia have worked together
in the past. During the World War II, they collaborated against the
Third Reich. And during the Cold War, they cooperated in nuclear arms
treaties and wheat deals, while mutually trying to skirt [a
**flashpoint**]{.underline} that [could end in a **nuclear war**.
Washington can work to steer]{.underline} the Kremlin, as it has done
before, [toward acceptable conduct]{.underline} with its neighbors
before Russia can be more than a tactical ally in the great game with
China. In the immediate future, the United States can adopt
international and domestic approaches to cope with Russian and Chinese
territorial expansionism. The [**tensions stoked by the assertive
regimes** in the Kremlin or Tiananmen Square could **spark a political
or military incident** that might **set off a chain reaction leading to
a large-scale war**]{.underline}. Historically, powerful rivalries
nearly always lead to at least skirmishes, if not a full-blown war. The
anomalous Cold War era spared the United States and Soviet Russia [a
direct conflict]{.underline}, largely from concerns [that]{.underline}
one [would trigger a **nuclear exchange destroying**]{.underline} both
states and much of **[the world]{.underline}**. Such a repetition might
reoccur in the unfolding three-cornered geopolitical world[. It seems
safe to acknowledge that an ascendant China and a resurgent Russia
**will persist** in their geo-strategic ambitions.]{.underline} What Is
To Be Done? The first marching order is to dodge any kind of perpetual
war of the sort that George Orwell outlined in "1984," which engulfed
the three super states of Eastasia, Eurasia, and Oceania, and made
possible the totalitarian Big Brother regime. A long-running Cold
War-type confrontation would almost certainly take another form than the
one that ran from 1945 until the downfall of the Soviet Union. [What
prescriptions can be offered in the face of the **escalating
competition** among the three global powers?]{.underline} First, **[by
staying militarily and economically strong, the United States will have
the resources to deter its peers' hawkish behavior that might otherwise
trigger a major conflict]{.underline}**. Judging by the history of the
Cold War, the coming strategic chess match with Russia and China will
prove tense and demanding---[since all the countries boast nuclear
arms]{.underline} and long-range ballistic missiles. Next, the United
States should widen and sustain willing coalitions of partners,
something at which America excels, and at which China and Russia fail
conspicuously. [There can be **little room for error**]{.underline} [in
fraught crises]{.underline} among nuclear-weaponized and hostile powers.
[Short- and long-term standoffs are likely]{.underline}, as they were
during the Cold War. [Thus, the playbook]{.underline}, in part,
[involves a waiting game in which each power looks to its rivals to
suffer **grievous internal problems** which could **entail a collapse,
as happened to the Soviet Union**]{.underline}. [Some Chinese and
Russian experts]{.underline} predict grave domestic problems for each
other. They also [entertain **similar thoughts about the United
States**]{.underline}, [which they view as terminally
decadent]{.underline} and catastrophically polarized over politics,
ethnicity, and the future direction of the country. [So, the brewing
three-way struggle also involves a **systemic contest**]{.underline},
[which will test the competitors']{.underline}
**[economic]{.underline}** and political **[institutions]{.underline}**.
[At this juncture, the world is entering a **standoff**]{.underline}
[among the three great and several not-so-great powers. **Averting
war**]{.underline}, while defending our interests, [will prove a
challenge, calling for]{.underline} deft policy, political endurance,
and **[economic growth]{.underline}**, [as well as **sufficient military
force to keep at bay aggressive states or prevail over them if ever a
war breaks out.**]{.underline}

#### Global nuclear war.

**Tønnesson 15**---Research Professor at the Peace Research Institute
Oslo; Leader of East Asia Peace program, Uppsala University \[Stein,
"Deterrence, interdependence and Sino--US peace," International Area
Studies Review, 2015, Vol. 18, No. 3, p. 297-311\]

Several [recent works]{.underline} on China and Sino--US relations [have
made]{.underline} substantial [contributions to the current
understanding of how and under what circumstances]{.underline} a
combination of [nuclear deterrence and economic interdependence may
reduce the risk of war between major powers]{.underline}. At least four
conclusions can be drawn from the review above: first, those who say
that [interdependence may **both inhibit and drive
conflict**]{.underline} are right. [Interdependence raises the cost of
conflict]{.underline} for all sides [but]{.underline} [asymmetrical or
unbalanced dependencies and **negative trade expectations**]{.underline}
may [generate tensions leading to trade wars among inter-dependent
states that]{.underline} in turn [increase the **risk of military
conflict**]{.underline} (Copeland, 2015: 1, 14, 437; Roach, 2014). The
risk may increase if one of the interdependent countries is governed by
an inward-looking socio-economic coalition (Solingen, 2015); second, the
risk of war between China and the US should not just be analysed
bilaterally but include their allies and partners. Third party countries
could drag China or the US into confrontation; third, in this context:
it is of some comfort that the three main economic powers in Northeast
Asia (China, Japan and South Korea) are all deeply integrated
economically through production networks within a global system of trade
and finance (Ravenhill, 2014; Yoshimatsu, 2014: 576); and fourth,
[decisions for war]{.underline} and peace [are taken by very few people,
who act on the basis of their **future expectations**]{.underline}.
International relations theory must be supplemented by foreign policy
analysis in order to assess the value attributed by national
decision-makers to economic development and their assessments of risks
and opportunities. [If leaders]{.underline} on either side of the
Atlantic [begin to seriously **fear or anticipate their own nation's
decline**]{.underline} then [they may blame]{.underline} this on
[external dependence, appeal to anti-foreign sentiments, contemplate the
use of force to gain]{.underline} respect or [credibility, adopt
protectionist policies, and]{.underline} ultimately **[refuse to be
deterred by]{.underline}** either [**nuclear arms** or prospects of
socioeconomic calamities. Such a dangerous shift could happen
**abruptly**]{.underline}, i.e. under the instigation of actions by a
third party -- or against a third party. Yet as long as there is both
nuclear deterrence and interdependence, the tensions [in East
Asia]{.underline} are unlikely to escalate to war. As Chan (2013) says,
all states in the region are aware that they cannot count on support
from either China or the US if they make provocative moves. [The
greatest risk is **not**]{.underline} that **[a territorial
dispute]{.underline}** leads to war under present circumstances [but
that **changes in the world economy** alter those circumstances in ways
that render inter-state peace more precarious]{.underline}. If China and
the US fail to rebalance their financial and trading relations (Roach,
2014) then a trade war could result, interrupting transnational
production networks, provoking social distress, and exacerbating
nationalist emotions. [This could have unforeseen consequences in the
field of security, with nuclear deterrence remaining the only factor to
**protect the world from Armageddon**, and **unreliably
so**]{.underline}. [Deterrence could **lose its
credibility**]{.underline}: one of the two [great powers might gamble
that the other yield in a cyber-war or conventional]{.underline} limited
[war]{.underline}, or third party countries might engage in conflict
with each other, with a view to obliging Washington or Beijing to
intervene.

### 2NC Trade Impact

#### Ratifying USMCA is critical to overall trade.

Chamber of Commerce executive: Why Approving USMCA is an urgent

Precedent. [**USMCA's path-breaking provisions** will serve **as a
precedent** for **future trade agreements** and provide **benefits that
will multiply** in the years ahead]{.underline}---but [only if Congress
approves USMCA. For example, USMCA prohibits "behind the border"
barriers against U.S. exports]{.underline}. [Too often, foreign
governments deploy regulations]{.underline} or standards [in an
arbitrary way to block imports]{.underline}. [USMCA halts
this]{.underline} kind of [**protectionism in disguise**.]{.underline}
[USMCA also raises the bar with binding enforcement]{.underline} for all
chapters. [This includes labor and the environment,]{.underline} [which
were not subject to state-to-state dispute settlement under]{.underline}
the [NAFTA]{.underline}. [The U.S. is **beginning trade negotiations**
with **Japan**, **the EU**, and **potentially other
countries.**]{.underline} [Approving USMCA will allow these
**breakthroughs** to serve as a precedent that **will shape these
agreements.**]{.underline} The Trump administration negotiated a good
deal with Canada and Mexico and it deserves to be approved without
delay. Approving USMCA will provide job creators with the certainty they
need to invest and hire, and the improved market access it promises will
spur economic growth. It will modernize North American trade in ways
that set a positive precedent for future trade talks. [Each day that
passes without approving USMCA is a day that **these benefits are
deferred**]{.underline}. Let's build on our momentum and seize these
benefits.

#### US trade leadership solves global nuclear war.

Nouriel **Roubini 17**, professor at NYU's Stern School of Business and
Chairman of Roubini Macro Associates, was Senior Economist for
International Affairs in the White House\'s Council of Economic Advisers
during the Clinton Administration, 1/2/17, ""America First" and Global
Conflict Next,"
<https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-isolationism-undermines-peace-worldwide-by-nouriel-roubini-2017-01>

Trump, however, may pursue populist, anti-globalization, and
protectionist [policies that hinder trade]{.underline} and restrict the
movement of labor and capital. And he has cast doubt on existing US
security guarantees by suggesting that he will force America's allies to
pay for more of their own defense. If Trump is serious about putting
"America first," his administration will shift US geopolitical strategy
toward isolationism and unilateralism, pursuing only the national
interests of the homeland. When the US pursued similar policies in the
1920s and 1930s, it [**helped sow the seeds of World War II**.
Protectionism]{.underline} -- starting with the Smoot-Hawley Tariff,
which affected thousands of imported goods -- [triggered retaliatory
trade and currency wars that worsened the Great Depression]{.underline}.
More important, [American isolationism]{.underline} -- based on a false
belief that the US was safely protected by two oceans --
[allowed]{.underline} Nazi [Germany and]{.underline} Imperial [Japan
to]{.underline} wage aggressive war and **[threaten the entire
world]{.underline}**. With the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941,
the US was finally forced to take its head out of the sand.
[Today]{.underline}, too, a US turn to isolationism and the [pursuit of
strictly US national interests may]{.underline} eventually **[lead to a
global conflict]{.underline}**. Even without the prospect of American
disengagement from Europe, the European Union and the eurozone already
appear to be disintegrating, particularly in the wake of the United
Kingdom's June Brexit vote and Italy's failed referendum on
constitutional reforms in December. Moreover, in 2017, extreme
anti-Europe left- or right-wing populist parties could come to power in
France and Italy, and possibly in other parts of Europe. Without active
US engagement in Europe, an aggressively revanchist Russia will step in.
Russia is already challenging the US and the EU in Ukraine, Syria, the
Baltics, and the Balkans, and it may capitalize on the EU's looming
collapse by reasserting its influence in the former Soviet bloc
countries, and supporting pro-Russia movements within Europe. If Europe
gradually loses its US security umbrella, no one stands to benefit more
than Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump's proposals also threaten
to exacerbate the situation in the Middle East. He has said that he will
make America energy independent, which entails abandoning US interests
in the region and becoming more reliant on domestically produced
greenhouse-gas-emitting fossil fuels. And he has maintained his position
that Islam itself, rather than just radical militant Islam, is
dangerous. This view, shared by Trump's incoming National Security
Adviser, General Michael Flynn, plays directly into Islamist militants'
own narrative of a clash of civilizations. Meanwhile, an "America first"
approach under Trump will likely worsen the longstanding Sunni-Shia
proxy wars between Saudi Arabia and Iran. And if the US no longer
guarantees its Sunni allies' security, all regional powers -- including
Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Egypt -- might decide that they can
defend themselves only by acquiring nuclear weapons, and even more
deadly conflict will ensue. In Asia, US economic and military primacy
has provided decades of stability; but a rising China is now challenging
the status quo. US President Barack Obama's strategic "pivot" to Asia
depended primarily on enacting the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership,
which Trump has promised to scrap on his first day in office. Meanwhile,
China is quickly strengthening its own economic ties in Asia, the
Pacific, and Latin America through its "one belt, one road" policy, the
Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the New Development Bank (formerly
known as the BRICS bank), and its own regional free-trade proposal to
rival the TPP. If the US gives up on its Asian allies such as the
Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan, those countries may have no choice
but to prostrate themselves before China; and other US allies, such as
Japan and India, may be forced to militarize and challenge China openly.
Thus, an American withdrawal from the region could very well eventually
precipitate a military conflict there. [As in the 1930s, when
protectionist]{.underline} and isolationist [US policies hampered global
economic growth and trade, and created]{.underline} the [conditions for
rising]{.underline} revisionist [powers to start a **world war**,
similar policy impulses could set the stage for new powers to challenge
and undermine the American-led international order]{.underline}. [An
isolationist Trump administration may]{.underline} see the wide oceans
to its east and west, and [think]{.underline} that increasingly
ambitious powers such as [Russia, China, and Iran pose no direct
threat]{.underline} to the homeland. [But the US is still a global
economic and financial power in a deeply interconnected
world]{.underline}. If [left unchecked, these countries
will]{.underline} eventually be able to **[threaten core US economic and
security interests]{.underline}** -- at home and abroad -- [especially
if they expand their **nuclear**]{.underline} and cyberwarfare
**[capacities]{.underline}**. The historical record is clear:
[**protectionism**, isolationism, and "America first" policies are a
**recipe for economic and military disaster**]{.underline}.

with the huge increase of trade]{.underline}** (partly coincidental with
the introduction of containerized shipping in the 1960s): [between 1820
and 1959 each pair of countries averaged .00056 wars per year, while
from 1960 to 2000 the average was .00005 wars per year, less than one
tenth as much]{.underline}. We see this pattern quite clearly in Figure
1.7 These changes also follow the advent of nuclear weapons, which
impacted the technology of war. Indeed, [we show how nuclear weapons can
lead to some changes in stability, but does not generate peace on its
own]{.underline}. Indeed, [in order to capture the actual patterns that
have emerged one must add]{.underline} other considerations - such as
[trade considerations - since the base model shows]{.underline} that
networks of **[alliances would not be stable with nuclear weapons but
without trade]{.underline}**.8¶ Thus, the second part of our analysis is
to enrich the base model to include international trade. Indeed, there
has been a rapid increase in global trade since World War II (partly
coincident with the growth of container shipping among other stimuli).
[The empirical relationship between war and trade is an active area of
research, with strong suggestions]{.underline} (e.g., Martin, Mayer, and
Thoenig (2008)) [that network concerns may be important]{.underline}.
So, we introduce a concept of a network of alliances being war and trade
stable, which allows countries to form alliances for either economic or
military considerations. In this richer model, an alliance allows
countries to trade with each other and to coordinate military
activities, and so can be formed for either reason. This restores
existence of networks of alliances that are stable against the addition
or deletion of alliances. [**Trade provides two helpful incentives**:
first it provides economic motivations to maintain **alliances**, and
the resulting denser network of alliances then has a **deterrent
effect**; and second, it can **reduce the incentives of a country to
attack another** since trade will be disrupted. This **reduces the
potential set of conflicts** and, together with the denser networks,
allows for]{.underline} a rich family of [stable networks]{.underline}
that can exhibit structures similar to networks we see currently.¶ We
provide some results on the existence and structure of war and trade
stable networks of alliances, showing that structures similar to those
observed over the past few decades are economically stable under
apparently reasonable parameters. It is important to note that another
dramatic change during the post-war period was the introduction of
nuclear weapons, which changes the technology of war and is generally
thought to have greatly increased the defensive advantage to those with
such weapons.9 Our model suggests that although world-wide adoption of
nuclear weapons could stabilize things in the absence of trade, it would
result in an empty network of alliances as the stable network. To
explain the much denser and more stable networks in the modern age along
with the paucity of war in a world where nuclear weapons are limited to
a small percentage of countries, our model points to the enormous growth
in trade as a big part of the answer. [We close the paper
with]{.underline} some [discussion of this]{.underline} potential [role
that]{.underline} the [**growth in trade has played in reducing wars
over the past half century**, and how this relates to the advent of the
nuclear age]{.underline}.¶ Before proceeding, let us say a few words
about how [this paper contributes to the study of war.]{.underline} The
literature on war provides many rationales for why wars occur. Our
analysis here fits firmly into what has become a "rationalist" tradition
based on cost and benefit analyses by rational actors, with roots seen
in writings such as Hobbes (1651) Leviathan, and has become the
foundation for much of the recent international relations literature.10¶
To our knowledge, **[there are no previous models of conflict that
game-theoretically model networks of alliances between
multiple]{.underline}** agents/**[countries based on costs and benefits
of wars]{.underline}**. 11 There are previous models of coalitions in
conflict settings (e.g., see Bloch (2012) for a survey). Here, network
structures add several things to the picture. Our model is very much in
a similar rationalist perspective of the literature that examines group
conflict (e.g., Esteban and Ray (1999, 2001); Esteban and Sakovicz
(2003)), but enriching it to admit network structures of alliances and
of international trade. [This allows us to admit patterns that are
consistent with the networks of alliances that are actually
observed]{.underline}, which are far from being partitions (e.g., the
U.S. is currently allied with both Israel and Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and
India, just to mention a couple of many prominent examples). More
importantly, our Theorem 3 provides a first model in which such
non-partitional such structures are stable and provide insight into
peace. Moreover, as we already mentioned above, [the observed patterns
of wars and of alliances are not partitional, and so this provides an
important advance in moving the models towards matching observed
patterns of wars, trade and alliances.]{.underline}¶ [Our model thus
serves as a foundation]{.underline} upon [which one can eventually build
more elaborate analyses of multilateral interstate alliances, trade, and
wars]{.underline}. It is also important to emphasize that [the network
of international trade is complex and can in fact be stable (and prevent
conflict) precisely because it cuts across coalitions]{.underline}. This
is in contrast to coalitional models that generally predict only the
grand coalition can be stable or that very exact balances are possible
(e.g., see Bloch, Sanchez-Pages, and Soubeyran (2006)). Again, this is
something illustrated in our Theorem 3, and which does not exist in the
previous literature. Finally, [**our model illuminates the relationships
between international trade, stable network structures, and peace**,
something not appearing in the previous literature]{.underline} - as the
previous literature that involves international trade and conflict
generally revolves around bilateral reasoning or focuses on instability
and armament (e.g., Garfinkel, Skaperdas, and Syropoulos (2014)) and
does not address the questions that we address here.¶ [The complex
relationship between trade and conflict]{.underline} is the subject of a
growing empirical literature (e.g., Barbieri (1996); Mansfield and
Bronson (1997); Martin, Mayer, and Thoenig (2008); Glick and Taylor
(2010); Hegre, Oneal, and Russett (2010)). The [literature not only has
to face challenges of endogeneity and causation, but also of substantial
heterogeneity in relationships, as well as geography, and the level of
conflict. The various correlations between conflict and trade are
complex and quite difficult to interpret, **and a model such as ours
that combines military and economic incentives**]{.underline}, and
others that may follow, **[can provide some structure with which to
interpret]{.underline}** some of the **[empirical
observations]{.underline}**, as we discuss in the concluding remarks.

#### Protectionism causes nuclear war.

**Panzner 8** (Michael Panzner, Faculty, New York Institute of Finance,
MA Columbia, "Financial Armageddon", p. 137-138)

Continuing calls for [curbs on]{.underline} the flow of finance and
[trade will inspire]{.underline} the United States and other nations to
spew forth protectionist legislation like the notorious
[Smoot-Hawley]{.underline} bill. Introduced at the start of the Great
Depression, it [triggered a series of]{.underline}
**[tit-for-tat]{.underline}** economic **[responses]{.underline}**,
[which many commentators believe helped turn a serious economic downturn
into a **prolonged** and **devastating global disaster**]{.underline}.
But if history is any guide, those lessons will have been long forgotten
during the next collapse. Eventually, fed by a mood of desperation and
growing public anger, restrictions on trade, finance, investment, and
immigration will almost certainly intensify. Authorities and ordinary
citizens will likely scrutinize the cross-border movement of Americans
and outsiders alike, and lawmakers may even call for a general crackdown
on nonessential travel. Meanwhile, many nations will make transporting
or sending funds to other countries exceedingly difficult. As desperate
officials try to limit the fallout from decades of ill-conceived,
corrupt, and reckless policies, they will introduce controls on foreign
exchange. Foreign individuals and companies seeking to acquire certain
American infrastructure assets, or tryiTradeng to buy property and other
assets on the cheap thanks to a rapidly depreciating dollar, will be
stymied by limits on investment by noncitizens. Those efforts will cause
spasms to ripple across economies and markets, disrupting global
payment, settlement, and clearing mechanisms. All of this will, of
course, continue to undermine business confidence and consumer spending.
In a world of lockouts and lockdowns, any link that transmits systemic
financial pressures across markets through arbitrage or portfolio-based
risk management, or that allows diseases to be easily spread from one
country to the next by tourists and wildlife, or that otherwise
facilitates unwelcome exchanges of any kind will be viewed with
suspicion and dealt with accordingly. The rise in isolationism and
[protectionism will bring about]{.underline} ever more heated arguments
and [dangerous]{.underline} [confrontations]{.underline} over shared
sources of oil, gas, and other key commodities as well as factors of
production that must, out of necessity, be acquired from
less-than-friendly nations. Whether involving raw materials used in
strategic industries or basic necessities such as food, water, and
energy, efforts to secure adequate supplies will take increasing
precedence in a world where demand seems constantly out of kilter with
supply. Disputes over the misuse, overuse, and pollution of the
environment and natural resources will become more commonplace. Around
the world, [such **tensions will give rise to full scale military
encounters**]{.underline}**,** often **[with minimal
provocation]{.underline}**. In some instances, economic conditions will
serve as a convenient pretext for conflicts that stem from cultural and
religious differences. Alternatively, nations may look to divert
attention away from domestic problems by channeling frustration and
populist sentiment toward other countries and cultures. Enabled by cheap
technology and the waning threat of American retribution, terrorist
groups will likely boost the frequency and scale of their horrifying
attacks, bringing the threat of random violence to a whole new level.
[Turbulent conditions]{.underline} will [encourage]{.underline}
**[aggressive saber rattling]{.underline}** and interdictions by rogue
nations running amok. [Age-old clashes will also take on a new, more
heated sense of urgency. **China** will likely assume an **increasingly
belligerent** posture toward **Taiwan**, while **Iran** may embark on
**overt colonization** of its neighbors in the Mideast.]{.underline}
Israel, for its part, may look to draw a dwindling list of allies from
around the world into a growing number of conflicts. Some observers,
like John Mearsheimer, a political scientist at the University of
Chicago, have even speculated that an "intense confrontation" between
the United States and China is "inevitable" at some point. More than a
few disputes will turn out to be almost wholly ideological. Growing
cultural and religious differences will be transformed from wars of
words to battles soaked in blood. Long-simmering **[resentments
could]{.underline}** also **[degenerate quickly, spurring]{.underline}**
the basest of human instincts and triggering genocidal acts. [Terrorists
employing]{.underline} **[biological or nuclear weapons]{.underline}**
[will vie with conventional forces using jets, cruise missiles, and
bunker-busting bombs to cause widespread destruction]{.underline}. Many

### 2NC Agriculture Impact

#### USMCA is necessary to prevent the collapse of US agriculture.

**Duvall 19** \-\-- Vincent "Zippy" Duvall, president of the American
Farm Bureau Federation, (\"U.S. Ag Gets a Great Deal with USMCA,\"

At the same time, we always have our eye on the latest technology and
tools that will make our farms and ranches more productive and more
efficient. I don't know a farmer or rancher who would pass up a good
deal that could make their business better. The same is true when it
comes to trade deals. When NAFTA was signed more than 25 years ago, it
was the best trade deal U.S. agriculture had ever seen. But [now there's
a new deal on offer]{.underline}---[the]{.underline} U.S.-Mexico-Canada
Agreement or [USMCA]{.underline}. [We have a chance to trade in a great
agreement for an even better one.]{.underline} Since NAFTA went into
effect in 1994, U.S. ag exports to Canada and Mexico have more than
quadrupled, making these our number 1 and number 2 markets respectively.
In 2018 alone, we exported \$20.7 billion in ag products to Canada and
\$19 billion to Mexico. These markets have only grown in value for U.S.
farmers and ranchers. Over the last decade, ag exports have increased 27
percent to Canada and 23 percent to Mexico. But as good as NAFTA has
been, it's time for an upgrade: it's time for Congress to approve USMCA.
**[Without USMCA, our most critical markets hang in the
balance]{.underline}**. [Both Canada and Mexico have already signed
another deal that does not include the United States]{.underline}. The
Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership
replaces the TPP agreement that the U.S. agreed to but then backed out
of in 2017. [The CPTPP gives Canada and Mexico preferential trade
terms]{.underline} with nine other countries and gives those countries
better access to Canada's and Mexico's markets―[all while the ongoing
trade war hangs overhead, with tariffs **hurting U.S. agricultural
exports**]{.underline}. Just this week, Japan is following through on
its promises under the CPTPP and reducing its tariffs and raising its
quotas for ag products from CPTPP partners. [This is all the more reason
why we must bring the **USMCA across the finish line** and **secure our
valuable trade partnership** with our nearest neighbors]{.underline}.
[The USMCA is also important in setting the stage for other modern trade
agreements for U.S. agriculture]{.underline}. **[NAFTA needed to be
modernized]{.underline}**, [and the USMCA has bells and whistles that we
don't have under our existing trade agreements]{.underline}. Let's look
under the hood. For the U.S., it's the first trade agreement to deal
with approval of and trade in products of biotechnology. This groundwork
will be critical in agreements we pursue with other countries,
especially in the EU, the UK and Japan. [The new agreement broadens
access for U.S. dairy]{.underline} and finally brings an end to Canada's
unfair class 7 pricing scheme. These are wins we didn't see even under
TPP. Finally, USMCA will [bring greater access for poultry, improve
wheat grading standards, and make much-needed improvements to animal and
plant health protection standards]{.underline}. Finally, ratifying the
USMCA will show our top trading partners and other countries that the
United States and the trade negotiators who represent us mean business.
It would prove that our word and handshake can be trusted when we strike
a deal. Right now, it's important for each of us to call on our
lawmakers in Washington and tell them **[how important the USMCA is to
agriculture]{.underline}**. [Farmers and ranchers are
resilient]{.underline}, [but our businesses---not to mention the jobs
and rural communities that depend on us---**cannot survive without our
top markets.**]{.underline} [Let's get this deal done, so we can move
forward with opening and **expanding more markets around the
globe.**]{.underline}

[The **U**nited **S**tates faces many threats to our National Security.
These threats include continuing wars with extremist elements such as
**ISIS** and potential wars with rogue state **North Korea** or regional
nuclear power **Iran.**]{.underline} [The heated economic and diplomatic
competition with **Russia** and a surging **China** could **spiral out
of control**.]{.underline} Concurrently, [we face threats to our future
security posed by growing civil strife, famine, and refugee and
migration challenges which create incubators for extremist and
anti-American government factions]{.underline}. Our response cannot be
one dimensional but instead must be a nuanced and comprehensive National
Security Strategy combining all elements of National Power including a
Food Security Strategy. [An **American Food Security Strategy** is an
imperative factor in **reducing the multiple threats impacting our
National wellbeing.**]{.underline} [Recent history has shown that
**reliable food supplies and stable prices produce more stable and
secure countries.** Conversely, food insecurity, particularly in poorer
countries, can lead to instability, unrest, and violence. **Food
insecurity** drives **mass migration** around the world from the Middle
East, to Africa, to Southeast Asia, destabilizing neighboring
populations, **generating conflicts**, and threatening our own security
by **disrupting** our **economic, military, and diplomatic
relationships**.]{.underline} [Food system shocks from extreme
food-price volatility can be correlated with protests and
riots.]{.underline} Food price related protests toppled governments in
Haiti and Madagascar in 2007 and 2008. In 2010 and in 2011, food prices
and grievances related to food policy were one of the major drivers of
the Arab Spring uprisings. Repeatedly, history has taught us that [**a
strong agricultural sector** is **an unquestionable requirement**
for]{.underline} inclusive and sustainable growth, broad-based
development progress, and **[long-term stability]{.underline}**. The
impact can be remarkable and far reaching. [**Rising income**, in
addition to reducing the opportunities for an upsurge in extremism,
leads to changes in diet, producing **demand** for more diverse and
nutritious foods provided, in many cases, from **American farmers** and
ranchers.]{.underline} [**Emerging markets** currently purchase **20
percent of U.S. agriculture** exports and that figure is **expected to
grow** as populations boom.]{.underline} Moving early to ensure
stability in strategically significant regions requires long term
planning and a disciplined, thoughtful strategy. To combat current
threats and work to prevent future ones, our national leadership must
employ the entire spectrum of our power including diplomatic, economic,
and cultural elements. The best means to prevent future chaos and the
resulting instability is positive engagement addressing the causes of
instability before it occurs. This is not rocket science. We know where
the instability is most likely to occur. The world population will grow
by 2.5 billion people by 2050. Unfortunately, this massive population
boom is projected to occur primarily in the most fragile and food
insecure countries. This alarming math is not just about total numbers.
Projections show that the greatest increase is in the age groups most
vulnerable to extremism. There are currently 200 million people in
Africa between the ages of 15 and 24, with that number expected to
double in the next 30 years. Already, 60% of the unemployed in Africa
are young people. Too often **[these situations deteriorate into
shooting wars]{.underline}** requiring the deployment of our military
forces. We should be continually mindful that the price we pay for
committing military forces is measured in our most precious national
resource, the blood of those who serve. For those who live in **[rural
America]{.underline}**, this has a disproportionate impact. Fully 40% of
those who serve in our military come from the farms, ranches, and
non-urban communities that make up only 16% of our population. Actions
taken now to increase agricultural sector jobs can provide economic
opportunity and stability for those unemployed youths while helping to
feed people. A recent report by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs
identifies agriculture development as the core essential for providing
greater food security, economic growth, and population well-being. [Our
active support for **food security**, including agriculture development,
has helped **stabilize key regions** over the past 60 years. A robust
food security strategy, as a part of our overall security strategy, can
mitigate the growth of terrorism, build important relationships, and
support continued American economic and agricultural prosperity while
materially contributing to our Nation's and the world's
security.]{.underline}

Corn Growers Association. "**[The settlement of Nafta is

demand, Grow said. [Soybean futures also advanced on **optimism that the

has shunned U.S. shipments amid the trade war and has increased
purchases from Brazil and other countries.

[On the **"new NAFTA**" trade deal just struck...]{.underline} "There
are two major changes for dairy in the new agreement. First, [there's
additional access for U.S.]{.underline} dairy [products into the
Canadian market]{.underline}. **[That's a very good thing for U.S.
producers.]{.underline}** It's important to keep it in context,
remembering we're talking about a couple of additional percentage points
worth of access to the Canadian market, which is about a ninth the size
of the market in the United States. But every little bit helps,
obviously. "The second change is harder to understand fully. It means
Canada will have to give up on their existing 'Class 7' pricing scheme.
Under that scheme, they've been able to make certain products from
Canada competitive that normally wouldn't be. "We'd been exporting a
product called 'ultra-filtered, high-protein milk' --- a product that
hadn't been envisioned when the first trade agreement was struck 30
years ago. Since there were no limitations on that product we were
selling quite a bit of it to Canada for use as a starting point to make
cheeses and other things. The Canadians said, 'Wait a minute, that's
undercutting our existing programs here. So, we need to find a way to
stop those imports from happening.' And they created the pricing scheme
to make them no longer attractive. "I understand they've agreed to
change that program. Until I understand better how it's to be changed I
don't feel confident saying exactly what will happen. "All of this is a
positive for U.S. dairy producers. The question is how big a positive
it'll be." On other commodities... "The other big change that wasn't in
previous agreements is additional access to Canadian poultry markets.
So, we'll be able to export more chicken and eggs. "Beyond that, my
understanding is [the main things we've done is **kept** **existing
agreements** in place]{.underline}. So, [**we won't have to** worry
about **Mexico wanting to reinstate high tariffs** on U.S.
corn.]{.underline} **[That won't be allowed]{.underline}** and we'll go

[A growing number of studies of environmental stressors and social
conflict posit that future wars will be fought over diminishing
resources]{.underline} (Miguel et al. 2004; Burke et al. 2009;O '
Loughlin et al. 2012; Scheffran et al. 2012 ). Building on insights from
these studies, as well as other suggestive accounts (e.g. Brinkman and
Hendrix 2011 ;Hendrix and Brinkman 2013 ; Messer and Cohen 2006 ;Prunier
2008 ), the present study demonstrates **[empirically]{.underline}**,
**[for the first time]{.underline}**, **[the existence of a systemic
relationship between conflict]{.underline}** on the one hand,
**[and]{.underline}** **[food (in) security]{.underline}** on the other,
both **[globally and locally]{.underline}**. Specifically, highly
disaggregated cropland-based measures of [food insecurity]{.underline}
are shown to [produce a **significant effect** on the incidence of inter
and intra-state armed conflict **worldwide**]{.underline}.
[Unlike]{.underline} the majority of **[previous studies]{.underline}**,
which rely primarily on country-level indicators (Miguel et al. 2004 ;
Burke et al. 2009 ; Scheffran et al. 2012 ;Buhaug 2010 ) or focus
specifically on sub-Saharan Africa (Miguel et al. 2004 ; Burke et al.
2009;O ' Loughlin et al. 2012;Buhaug 2010; Fjelde and Hultman 2014 ),
the present approach uses geographic factors to estimate the regional
sub-state distribution of conflict globally. Two agricultural output
measures, the percent of cropland in a given region and the amount of
cropland per capita within agricultural regions, are used to proxy for
the demand and supply aspects of food security, respectively (Barrett
2010 ). Using logistic regression (i.e., logit) models, [these measures
are]{.underline} then [paired with a large number of political,
economic, and **climatic** indicators]{.underline} in order [to estimate
the]{.underline} **[direct effects of food security on violent
conflict]{.underline}**. Evidence suggests that [conflict occurs in
areas with higher access to, but lower availability of, food
resources]{.underline}. Together these findings imply that [food
insecurity produces an]{.underline} **[independent effect on
contemporary social and political conflict]{.underline}**. While
relatively little research directly addresses the relationship between
food insecurity and conflict specifically, [numerous
studies]{.underline} have [implie]{.underline}d that such [a
relationship exists]{.underline}. For instance, in their analysis of the
relationship between climate variability and conflict in Sub-Saharan
Africa, Burke et al. found that B \[t\]emperature variables are strongly
related to conflict incidence over our historical panel \^ (2009 ,
20,670. See also Miguel et al. 2004 ; Koubi et al. 2012 ). They further
hypothesize that, B \[t\]emperature can affect agricultural yields both
through increases in crop evapotranspiration (and hence heightened water
stress in the absence of irrigation) and through accelerated crop

#### Won't Pass -- Pressure is backfiring

**KIRBY 5/31** (Jen; Vox, "Trump wants to pass his trade deal. But he's
not acting like it."
https://www.vox.com/2019/5/31/18647195/trump-trade-deal-tariff-mexico-canada-usmca)ww

Vice President Mike Pence and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met
in Ottawa on Thursday to promote the revised NAFTA deal, now known as
the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA. But as Pence was
extolling the trade deal in Canada, the Trump administration followed up
by potentially undermining the very trade pact that it renegotiated.
[[Trump riled]{.mark} House [Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark} [by
notifying]{.mark} Congress on Thursday [that he wants to move forward
with]{.mark} the [USMCA]{.mark} approval process, even though Democrats
still object to some of the USMCA's provisions]{.underline}. And, most
critically, Trump announced new tariffs on Mexico on Thursday night in
an attempt to force the country to crack down on migration --- something
that's gotten bipartisan pushback. Both of these moves threaten the
USMCA here in the US and in Mexico. Canada, at least for now, is largely
outside the drama. It implemented its legislation to ratify the USMCA
this week, with the goal of approving it next month. The thing with a
trilateral trade pact is that you need all three countries on board for
it to go in effect. Two weeks ago, Trump struck [[a deal to lift]{.mark}
steel and aluminum [tariffs]{.mark} on Mexico and Canada]{.underline},
which [[seemed to clear the way]{.mark} for the USMCA
approval]{.underline}. [[But the White House]{.mark}'s latest moves
[have now thrown that into]{.mark} [question]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Trump's notification to Congress, briefly explained Trump signed the
USMCA --- along with Trudeau and then-Mexican President Enrique Peña
Nieto --- in November. But legislatures in all three countries still
need to approve this updated version of the North American Free Trade
Agreement. Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico
represented a huge hurdle to the deal ever getting passed, as both
Canada and Mexico, as well as members of Congress (including
Republicans), wanted those tariffs lifted before they would even
entertain the idea of passing the USMCA. And in May, the White House
struck a deal to get rid of the tariffs, an announcement that renewed
optimism in the deal's future. But that might have been premature.
[Beyond the tariffs]{.underline}, House Speaker Nancy [Pelosi and other
House Democrats have also made clear that they want stronger enforcement
of labor provisions in the USMCA, along with some beefing up of
environmental protections and drug provisions]{.underline}. [Though
Mexico passed new labor laws last month that will help it comply with
the new standards in the USMCA, [Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark} [and labor
unions]{.mark} in the US [still had some issues]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The Trump administration's top trade official, Robert [Lighthizer, has
upped his outreach with Democrats on Capitol Hill in recent weeks. And
both sides seemed hopeful that the administration and House Democrats
could reach some sort of resolution to get the USMCA through Congress
with bipartisan support]{.underline}. [But on Thursday, [Trump]{.mark}
essentially [told]{.mark} House [Dem]{.mark}ocrats that [he wants to
move ahead, against their objections]{.mark}]{.underline}. The White
House submitted what's called a draft statement of administrative
action, which is basically a notice that it plans to submit the USMCA
legislation after 30 days. It can be longer than 30 days (not shorter),
but [the message is pretty much]{.underline} the same: [no more
delays]{.underline}. The White House and Democrats can keep talking
during this period --- and Lighthizer said he would continue to work
with Democrats. But [[it's]{.mark} definitely [putting pressure on House
Democrats]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The president clearly wants
USMCA passed before the fall, and definitely before the 2020 campaign
gets fully underway. Trump would really like to list renegotiating the
"worst trade deal in history" as one of his accomplishments. If he can't
do that, though, then the next best thing might be to blame the
Democrats for obstructing his new trade deal. "If you kind of throw this
bomb in their court, then for at least a significant portion of his
base, they'll be willing to except his interpretation of this --- as
Democrats causing problems rather than the Trump administration causing
problems," Todd Tucker, a trade expert at the Roosevelt Institute, a
liberal think tank, told me. [But Pelosi is in no such rush, and while
she's indicated she could get to "yes" on NAFTA, she said she wants to
more closely examine the enforcement mechanisms]{.underline}. [And
Pelosi wasn't amused by the White House's decision to submit that notice
to Congress, though, and had warned Lighthizer against talking this
step]{.underline}, according to the Washington Post. "The Trump
Administration's decision to send Congress a draft statement of
administrative action before we have finished working with U.S. Trade
Representative Lighthizer to ensure the USMCA benefits American workers
and farmers is not a positive step," Pelosi said in a statement. "It
indicates a lack of knowledge on the part of the Administration on the
policy and process to pass a trade agreement." [Pelosi does have
leverage on whether or not to bring the USMCA legislation to the floor
--- and she's used it to sidetrack trade deals in the past, including in
2008 with George W. Bush's trade pact with Colombia]{.underline}. And if
Democrats were already reluctant about the USMCA, a revived trade war
with Mexico isn't exactly going to help things. And it might alienate
some Republicans, too. Oh, and then there's these new tariffs on Mexico
Trump tweeted Thursday night that, starting in two weeks, the US plans
to impose 5 percent tariffs on all goods coming "into our Country from
Mexico" until Mexico basically solves a migration problem that neither
country has ever been able to solve. Those tariffs will gradually
increase the longer Mexico fails to curb migration. Trump's use of
tariffs as a pressure tactic isn't exactly shocking. But that he chose
to take this step while trying to get the USMCA passed is somewhat
strange. And it's not just the potential opposition from Mexico that's
the problem: Neither Republicans nor Democrats in Congress are
enthusiastic about the move. Republicans and business groups have
already pushed back, saying the tariffs are endangering the USMCA.
"Trade policy and border security are separate issues," Sen. Chuck
Grassley (R-IO), who leads the Senate Finance Committee that will handle
USMCA, said, according to Politico. "This is a misuse of presidential
tariff authority and counter to congressional intent. Following through
on this threat would seriously jeopardize passage of USMCA, a central
campaign pledge of President Trump's and what could be a big victory for
the country." Or as Vox's Matt Yglesias put it, "Creating a huge trade
policy blowup with Mexico is not a great way of convincing Congress to
move forward with USMCA and could scuttle things in the Mexican Congress
as well." The administration has insisted that the two issues are
unrelated. Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said on a
call Thursday that "these are not tariffs as part of a trade dispute,
these are tariffs as part of an immigration matter, the USMCA is
entirely separate." But eliminating tariffs and other trade barriers is
supposed to be one of the perks of trade agreements, and if Trump keeps
going around that by invoking national security concerns, the US becomes
a far less attractive trading partner to Mexico, Canada, and just about
everyone else. Mexico introduced legislation this week to ratify the
USMCA, and, as mentioned, has already passed laws to bring it into
compliance with the deal's new labor provisions. Mexico has the most to
lose if the the USMCA falls apart. At the same time, Trump is not
popular among Mexicans --- for reasons that should be pretty apparent
--- and these new tariffs will make it all the more politically
complicated to pass the USMCA. This puts Mexico's president, Andrés
Manuel López Obrador (or AMLO for short), in a bit of a tight spot. AMLO
is pushing back, and likely trying to persuade Trump not to make good on
his threat. The Mexican president sent a letter to Trump on Friday where
he basically said Mexico is trying to curb migration, but it's not going
to respond to threats. "Please, remember that I do not lack valor, that
I am not a coward nor timorous but rather act according to principles,"
AMLO wrote, according to the Associated Press. [As Tucker, the trade
expert at the Roosevelt Institute, points out]{.underline}, Trump can
also blame Mexico for obstructing USMCA if it balks over tariffs. But
that's a much harder case to make when Trump is also isolating Congress.
Trump was already having a hard enough time with Democrats, but now he's
got Republicans to deal with, too. "I think the fact that he made the
threat makes it hard to land this, ever," Tucker said. [It was always
going to be difficult, especially with Democrats in control of the
House]{.underline}. "[Now, it just makes it virtually impossible. I
don't see how you have a successful conclusion of \[the USMCA\] after
this]{.underline}."

### Tariff Thumper

#### Tariff Threats Thump

Mexican Trade War Of 2019?"
https://www.forbes.com/sites/phillevy/2019/06/08/who-won-the-mexican-trade-war-of-2019/#3c9dcf6c1c1c)ww

The Mexican Trade War began with a Tweet and concluded with a Tweet. As
it happened, [no actual tariffs were applied, but there were still
consequences]{.underline}. The President and his supporters have claimed
the result as a victory, although most politicians do not hold their
victories for public announcement on a Friday evening. Applying the same
approach we did to the launch of hostilities, here are five thoughts
about the sudden cessation of hostilities: What was in the deal?
President Trump announced that the United States and Mexico had signed
an agreement which removed the need for the tariffs. The joint
declaration put out by the State Department described Mexican deployment
of its National Guard on its southern border as well as moves against
human trafficking networks. It also references the distinction between
illegal immigration and asylum seekers, with Mexico referencing
international obligations for dealing with asylum applicants. President
Trump also said Mexico had agreed to "BEGIN BUYING LARGE QUANTITIES OF
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS!" While agriculture
was an issue in the NAFTA talks, there was no diplomatic release
describing any new agricultural agreements reached this past week. Will
it fix the problems President Trump identified? Almost certainly not. On
migratory flows and human trafficking from Central America, the problems
seem to run substantially deeper than just a lack of Mexican willpower.
Few countries have ever had the ability to control their borders
completely. Further, President Trump did not limit his aspirations to
controlling immigration. He also called for Mexico to stop the flow of
drugs and claimed, "They can do it if they want!" Mexico has had many of
the problems common to developing countries -- difficulty maintaining
control of a vast territory with limited resources. In fact, the United
States has its own issues with law enforcement -- homicide and narcotics
use are illegal, yet they persist. And this continues despite the fact
that the United States is vastly richer -- per capita income of almost
\$60k per year as compared to almost \$9k per year in Mexico. This all
suggests that the problems run deeper than a lack of willpower. Where
does this leave U.S. trade with Mexico? In trouble. [It's tempting to
think that, without the coming imposition on tariffs]{.underline} on
Monday, [all is well]{.underline}. [Now it just remains for Mexico,
Canada, and the United States to pass the USMCA, as they were planning
before this interruption]{.underline}. [The problem is that the tariff
threat entirely undercut the rationale of the USMCA]{.underline}. [Such
trade agreements are heavily premised on the idea that trade is linked
to investment and that industries need a degree of certainty to take
full advantage of the trade relationship]{.underline}. This was the
reason there was such strong pushback against the Trump administration's
proposal to introduce a "sunset clause" that would create an expiration
date for the deal. [When President Trump made his tariff threat, he
demonstrated that the USMCA offered no guarantees of
certainty]{.underline}. [He could and would ignore it with just over a
week's notice]{.underline}. [Trade uncertainty would reign
supreme]{.underline}. Ironically, [the only reason the USMCA won a
positive rating]{.underline} from the U.S. International Trade
Commission last month [was because that body assumed the deal would
reduce trade policy uncertainty]{.underline}. [In the absence of such a
presumption, the USMCA was predicted to actually reduce U.S.
GDP]{.underline}. [And the basic argument about the costliness of trade
policy uncertainty shows exactly why the mere threat of Mexican tariffs
can have negative effects, even if the President never slaps them
on]{.underline}. [So it now looks like a loser for the United
States]{.underline}. What about for Mexico? Mexico is being asked to
make changes to its economic policy as part of its USMCA commitments.
What does it get for those concessions? The old answer was that it got a
guarantee of trade peace. It's now clear that, at least from the Trump
administration, such a guarantee is worthless. [NAFTA and USMCA were
valuable if they prevented the member countries from arbitrarily
applying tariffs. President Trump has called the whole rationale into
question]{.underline}. Where does this leave Trump administration trade
policy? This problem extends well beyond Mexico. Consider the rest of
the Trump trade agenda. In the Asia-Pacific, the Trump administration
opened by denying U.S. farmers and businesses the market access they
would have gotten from agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
The U.S. absence from the TPP's successor agreement has meant, for
example, that Canadian and Australian ranchers can ship their beef into
Japan on better terms than U.S. ranchers. President Trump promised to
remedy this by striking new bilateral deals with Japan, Europe, the UK,
and more. All of those countries will have watched the Mexican episode
closely. All will now be exceedingly wary about trading anything of
value for Trump administration promises of trade peace. Is it over?
There are at least two clues that the threat to U.S.-Mexico trade has
not gone away. First, President Trump's Friday night announcement was of
an "indefinite suspension." The language strongly suggests the threat
could return. Second, the joint declaration put out by the State
Department says: Both parties also agree that, in the event the measures
adopted do not have the expected results, they will take further
actions. Therefore, the United States and Mexico will continue their
discussions on the terms of additional understandings to address
irregular migrant flows and asylum issues, to be completed and announced
within 90 days, if necessary." Thus, there will be two conflicting
forces at work. On the one hand, [predictable disappointment will
restoke pressures to lift the tariff suspension -- it is exceedingly
likely that the measures adopted in the joint declaration will not have
the expected results]{.underline}. On the other hand, pushing against
new imposition of tariffs will still be the strong resistance from
markets, businesses, and political leaders that stymied the push for
tariffs this past week. [The President's devotion to tariffs and his
refusal to forswear them will mean that, even without actual imposition
of duties, some adverse effects are likely to remain]{.underline}.

#### No Link -- lack of media coverage means the plan won't be perceived

**HARTUNG '16** (William D.; director of the Arms and Security Project
at the Center for International Policy, "The Obama Administration Has
Brokered More Weapons Sales Than Any Other Administration Since World
War II,"
https://www.thenation.com/article/the-obama-administration-has-sold-more-weapons-than-any-other-administration-since-world-war-ii/)ww

[When American firms dominate a global market]{.underline} worth more
than \$70 billion a year, [you'd expect to hear about it]{.underline}.
[Not so with the global arms trade]{.underline}. [It's good for one or
two stories a year in the mainstream media]{.underline}, usually when
the annual statistics on the state of the business come out. [It's not
that no one writes about aspects of the arms trade]{.underline}. [There
are occasional pieces]{.underline} that, for example, take note of the
impact of US weapons transfers, including cluster bombs, to Saudi
Arabia, or of the disastrous dispensation of weaponry to US allies in
Syria, or of foreign sales of the costly, controversial F-35 combat
aircraft. And once in a while, if a foreign leader meets with the
president, US [arms sales]{.underline} to his or her country [might
generate an article or two]{.underline}. [But the]{.underline} sheer
size of the American arms trade, the [politics that drive
it]{.underline}, the companies that profit from it, and its devastating
global impacts [are rarely discussed, much less analyzed in any
depth]{.underline}. So here's a question that's puzzled me for years
(and I'm something of an arms wonk): Why do other major US
exports---from Hollywood movies to Midwestern grain shipments to Boeing
airliners---garner regular coverage while trends in weapons exports
remain in relative obscurity? Are we ashamed of standing essentially
alone as the world's number one arms dealer, or is our Weapons "R" Us
role such a commonplace that we take it for granted, like death or
taxes? The numbers should stagger anyone. According to the latest
figures available from the Congressional Research Service, the United
States was credited with more than half the value of all global arms
transfer agreements in 2014, the most recent year for which full
statistics are available. At 14 percent, the world's second largest
supplier, Russia, lagged far behind. Washington's "leadership" in this
field has never truly been challenged. The US share has fluctuated
between one-third and one-half of the global market for the past two
decades, peaking at an almost monopolistic 70 percent of all weapons
sold in 2011. And the gold rush continues. Vice Admiral Joe Rixey, who
heads the Pentagon's arms sales agency, euphemistically known as the
Defense Security Cooperation Agency, estimates that arms deals
facilitated by the Pentagon topped \$46 billion in 2015, and are on
track to hit \$40 billion in 2016. To be completely accurate, there is
one group of people who pay remarkably close attention to these
trends---executives of the defense contractors that are cashing in on
this growth market. With the Pentagon and related agencies taking in
"only" about \$600 billion a year---high by historical standards but
tens of billions of dollars less than hoped for by the defense
industry---companies like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and General
Dynamics have been looking to global markets as their major source of
new revenue. In a January 2015 investor call, for example, Lockheed
Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson was asked whether the Iran nuclear deal
brokered by the Obama administration and five other powers might reduce
tensions in the Middle East, undermining the company's strategy of
increasing its arms exports to the region. She responded that continuing
"volatility" in both the Middle East and Asia would make them "growth
areas" for the foreseeable future. In other words, no worries. As long
as the world stays at war or on the verge of it, Lockheed Martin's
profits won't suffer---and, of course, its products will help ensure
that any such "volatility" will prove lethal indeed. Under Hewson,
Lockheed has set a goal of getting at least 25 percent of its revenues
from weapons exports, and Boeing has done that company one better. It's
seeking to make overseas arms sales 30 percent of its business. GOOD
NEWS FROM THE MIDDLE EAST (IF YOU'RE AN ARMS MAKER) Arms deals are a way
of life in Washington. From the president on down, significant parts of
the government are intent on ensuring that American arms will flood the
global market and companies like Lockheed and Boeing will live the good
life. From the president on his trips abroad to visit allied world
leaders to the secretaries of state and defense to the staffs of US
embassies, American officials regularly act as salespeople for the arms
firms. And the Pentagon is their enabler. From brokering, facilitating,
and literally banking the money from arms deals to transferring weapons
to favored allies on the taxpayers' dime, it is in essence the world's
largest arms dealer. In a typical sale, the US government is involved
every step of the way. The Pentagon often does assessments of an allied
nation's armed forces in order to tell them what they "need"---and of
course what they always need is billions of dollars in new US-supplied
equipment. Then the Pentagon helps negotiate the terms of the deal,
notifies Congress of its details, and collects the funds from the
foreign buyer, which it then gives to the US supplier in the form of a
defense contract. In most deals, the Pentagon is also the point of
contact for maintenance and spare parts for any US-supplied system. The
bureaucracy that helps make all of this happen, the Defense Security
Cooperation Agency, is funded from a 3.5 percent surcharge on the deals
it negotiates. This gives it all the more incentive to sell, sell, sell.
And the pressure for yet more of the same is always intense, in part
because the weapons makers are careful to spread their production
facilities to as many states and localities as possible. In this way,
they ensure that endless support for government promotion of major arms
sales becomes part and parcel of domestic politics. General Dynamics,
for instance, has managed to keep its tank plants in Ohio and Michigan
running through a combination of add-ons to the Army budget---funds
inserted into that budget by Congress even though the Pentagon didn't
request them---and exports to Saudi Arabia. Boeing is banking on a
proposed deal to sell 40 F-18s to Kuwait to keep its St. Louis
production line open, and is currently jousting with the Obama
administration to get it to move more quickly on the deal. Not
surprisingly, members of Congress and local business leaders in such
states become strong supporters of weapons exports. Though seldom
thought of this way, the US political system is also a global arms
distribution system of the first order. In this context, the Obama
administration has proven itself a good friend to arms exporting firms.
During President Obama's first six years in office, Washington entered
into agreements to sell more than \$190 billion in weaponry
worldwide---more, that is, than any US administration since World War
II. In addition, Team Obama has loosened restrictions on arms exports,
making it possible to send abroad a whole new range of weapons and
weapons components---including Black Hawk and Huey helicopters and
engines for C-17 transport planes---with far less scrutiny than was
previously required. This has been good news for the industry, which had
been pressing for such changes for decades with little success. But the
weaker regulations also make it potentially easier for arms smugglers
and human rights abusers to get their hands on US arms. For example, 36
US allies---from Argentina and Bulgaria to Romania and Turkey---will no
longer need licenses from the State Department to import weapons and
weapons parts from the United States. This will make it far easier for
smuggling networks to set up front companies in such countries and get
US arms and arms components that they can then pass on to third parties
like Iran or China. Already a common practice, it will only increase
under the new regulations. The degree to which the Obama administration
has been willing to bend over backward to help weapons exporters was
underscored at a 2013 hearing on those administration export "reforms."
Tom Kelly, then the deputy assistant secretary of the State Department's
Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, caught the spirit of the era when
asked whether the administration was doing enough to promote American
arms exports. He responded: "\[We are\] advocating on behalf of our
companies and doing everything we can to make sure that these sales go
through... and that is something we are doing every day, basically
\[on\] every continent in the world... and we're constantly thinking of
how we can do better." One place where, with a helping hand from the
Obama administration and the Pentagon, the arms industry has been doing
a lot better of late is the Middle East. Washington has brokered deals
for more than \$50 billion in weapons sales to Saudi Arabia alone for
everything from F-15 fighter aircraft and Apache attack helicopters to
combat ships and missile defense systems. The most damaging deals, if
not the most lucrative, have been the sales of bombs and missiles to the
Saudis for their brutal war in Yemen, where thousands of civilians have
been killed and millions of people are going hungry. Members of Congress
like Michigan Representative John Conyers and Connecticut Senator Chris
Murphy have pressed for legislation that would at least stem the flow of
the most deadly of the weaponry being sent for use there, but they have
yet to overcome the considerable clout of the Saudis in Washington (and,
of course, that of the arms industry as well). When it comes to the arms
business, however, there's no end to the good news from the Middle East.
Take the administration's proposed new 10-year aid deal with Israel. If
enacted as currently planned, it would boost US military assistance to
that country by up to 25 percent---to roughly \$4 billion per year. At
the same time, it would phase out a provision that had allowed Israel to
spend one-quarter of Washington's aid developing its own defense
industry. In other words, all that money, the full \$4 billion in
taxpayer dollars, will now flow directly into the coffers of companies
like Lockheed Martin, which is in the midst of completing a
multi-billion-dollar deal to sell the Israelis F-35s. "VOLATILITY" IN
ASIA AND EUROPE As Lockheed Martin's Marillyn Hewson noted, however, the
Middle East is hardly the only growth area for that firm or others like
it. The dispute between China and its neighbors over the control of the
South China Sea (which is in many ways an incipient conflict over
whether that country or the United States will control that part of the
Pacific Ocean) has opened up new vistas when it comes to the sale of
American warships and other military equipment to Washington's East
Asian allies. The recent Hague court decision rejecting Chinese claims
to those waters (and the Chinese rejection of it) is only likely to
increase the pace of arms buying in the region. At the same time, in the
good-news-never-ends department, growing fears of North Korea's nuclear
program have stoked a demand for US-supplied missile defense systems.
The South Koreans have, in fact, just agreed to deploy Lockheed Martin's
THAAD anti-missile system. In addition, the Obama administration's
decision to end the longstanding embargo on US arms sales to Vietnam is
likely to open yet another significant market for US firms. In the past
two years alone, the United States has offered more than \$15 billion
worth of weaponry to allies in East Asia, with Taiwan, Japan, and South
Korea accounting for the bulk of the sales. In addition, the Obama
administration has gone to great lengths to build a defense relationship
with India, a development guaranteed to benefit US arms exporters. Last
year, Washington and New Delhi signed a 10-year defense agreement that
included pledges of future joint work on aircraft engines and aircraft
carrier designs. In these years, the United States has made significant
inroads into the Indian arms market, which had traditionally been
dominated by the Soviet Union and then Russia. Recent deals include a
\$5.8 billion sale of Boeing C-17 transport aircraft and a \$1.4 billion
agreement to provide support services related to a planned purchase of
Apache attack helicopters. And don't forget "volatile" Europe. Great
Britain's recent Brexit vote introduced an uncertainty factor into
American arms exports to that country. The United Kingdom has been by
far the biggest purchaser of US weapons in Europe of late, with more
than \$6 billion in deals struck over the past two years alone---more,
that is, than the United States has sold to all other European countries
combined. The British defense behemoth BAE is Lockheed Martin's
principal foreign partner on the F-35 combat aircraft, which at a
projected cost of \$1.4 trillion over its lifetime already qualifies as
the most expensive weapons program in history. If Brexit-driven
austerity were to lead to a delay in, or the cancellation of, the F-35
deal (or any other major weapons shipments), it would be a blow to
American arms makers. But count on one thing: were there to be even a
hint that this might happen to the F-35, lobbyists for BAE will mobilize
to get the deal privileged status, whatever other budget cuts may be in
the works. On the bright side (if you happen to be a weapons maker), any
British reductions will certainly be more than offset by opportunities
in Eastern and Central Europe, where a new Cold War seems to be gaining
traction. Between 2014 and 2015, according to the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute, military spending increased by
13 percent in the region in response to the Russian intervention in
Ukraine. The rise in Poland's outlays, at 22 percent, was particularly
steep. Under the circumstances, it should be obvious that trends in the
global arms trade are a major news story and should be dealt with as
such in the country most responsible for putting more weapons of a more
powerful nature into the hands of those living in "volatile" regions.
It's a monster business (in every sense of the word) and certainly has
far more dangerous consequences than licensing a Hollywood blockbuster
or selling another Boeing airliner. [Historically, there have been rare
occasions of public protest against unbridled arms
trafficking]{.underline}, as with the backlash against "the merchants of
death" after World War I, or the controversy over who armed Saddam
Hussein that followed the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Even now, small numbers
of congressional representatives, including John Conyers, Chris Murphy,
and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, continue to try to halt the sale of
cluster munitions, bombs, and missiles to Saudi Arabia. [There is,
however, unlikely to be a genuine public debate about the value of the
arms business and Washington's place in it if it isn't even considered a
subject worthy of more than an occasional media story]{.underline}. In
the meantime, the United States continues to hold onto the number one
role in the global arms trade, the White House does its part, the
Pentagon greases the wheels, and the dollars roll in to profit-hungry US
weapons contractors.

### No Veto

#### Trump won't veto -- strong congressional action dissuades 

**KERR 4/1** (Paul K.; Specialist in Nonproliferation -- Congressional
Research Service, "Arms Sales: Congressional Review Process,"
https://fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/RL31675.pdf)ww

In summary, in the absence of a strong majority in both houses of
Congress supporting legislation to block or modify a prospective arms
sale, the practical and procedural obstacles to passing such a
law---whether a freestanding measure or one within the AECA
framework---are great. Even if Congress can pass the requisite
legislation to work its will on an arms sale, [the President need only
veto]{.underline} it and secure the support of one-third plus one of the
Members of either the Senate or the House to have the veto sustained and
permit the sale. It should be noted that Congress has never successfully
blocked a proposed arms sale by use of a joint resolution of
disapproval, although it has come close to doing so (see section below
for selected examples). [Nevertheless,]{.underline} [Congress has---by
expressing strong opposition to prospective arms sales]{.underline},
during consultations with the executive branch---[affected the timing
and the composition of some arms sales, and may have dissuaded the
President from formally proposing certain arms sales]{.underline}.

### No Trump PC

#### Trump lacks the ability to use political capital effectively

**AZARI '17** (Julia; associate professor of political science at
Marquette University, "Trump Came In As A Weak President, And He's Made
Himself Weaker," 8/1,
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-weak-president/)ww

In the last week, the Republicans' Obamacare repeal effort failed on the
Senate floor despite President Trump urging GOP senators to vote yes.
The White House underwent rapid and chaotic staff changes. And Congress
expressly went against the wishes of a president of its own party by
overwhelmingly approving more sanctions against Russia in response to
its meddling in the 2016 election. So, are we looking at a weak
presidency? [Much gets written and said about presidential power, but
it's tricky to nail down what the concept really means]{.underline}.
Presidents have lots of powers they can use on their own, including
executive orders and other unilateral tools. And they can use these
tools under any conditions --- Trump's ability to sign an executive
order, for instance, remains undiminished. [But when people talk about a
president's power, what they really tend to mean is his ability to
influence other political actors, particularly Congress]{.underline}.
[And political science research has a few things to say about when and
how presidents exert that influence]{.underline}. [The circumstances
under which Trump came into office were always likely to limit his
ability to sway Congress, but the administration's actions since the
inauguration haven't helped]{.underline}. The classic insight about
presidential power came from the late Richard Neustadt in a book first
published in 1960, in which he argued that "[presidential power is the
power to persuade]{.underline}" (an idea he attributed to Harry Truman)
and identified the president's professional reputation among Washington
elites and, to a lesser extent, his standing in the public eye, as key
sources of the president's ability to influence others. [Presidential
power]{.underline}, according to Neustadt, [is a process of
bargaining]{.underline}. Successful negotiations would make subsequent
successes more likely by enhancing the president's prestige both in
public and in legislative circles. [Bargaining]{.underline} also
[requires understanding legislators' incentives and being able to read
public opinion]{.underline}, Neustadt wrote. Under Neustadt's definition
of power, it can be hard to observe the exercise of presidential power
while it's happening, but last week's debacle over transgender
individuals serving in the military provides a pretty good illustration
of how it works --- and doesn't. Trump appeared to enact the ban as part
of a deal to get Congress to fund part of a border wall. But the tactic
was ineffective because it drew significant backlash --- some of it from
military leaders, who hadn't been consulted. Congressional reaction to
the ban, even among Republicans, was tepid. The outcome of this battle
is still uncertain --- the House approved the funding Trump is looking
for, but the bill still has to clear the Senate. In the meantime, Trump
frustrated members of his own Cabinet and party with an announcement
that may never lead to real policy change. It remains to be seen whether
the tradeoff will be worth it in the long term. More contemporary
political science research has focused on political conditions in
general, rather than the individual officeholder's skills and traits, as
the main determinant of a president's influence on Congress. [A
president's popularity does matter]{.underline} --- research suggests
that it can help him influence Congress, depending on the issue --- [but
even the most popular and charismatic president can't fundamentally
alter the political environment, and members of Congress will generally
respond to their own political incentives]{.underline}. What do we mean
by the political environment? Although it's somewhat difficult to
disentangle the various factors, electoral strength and party backing
matter to some degree. While presidential "mandates" are more myth than
reality, there is some evidence that Congress is more amenable to the
president's agenda if they think the election was understood as a
mandate for it. In other words, a president who won the White House in a
rout after campaigning on a clear platform --- think Lyndon Johnson
running on Great Society policies in 1964 --- is likely to have an
easier time getting Congress to do what he wants than a president who
campaigned on generalities and limped into office with only a plurality
of the vote --- think Bill Clinton in 1992, when he won 43 percent of
the popular vote with a compelling personal story and a vague-ish
message about improving the economy. [And]{.underline} while presidents'
parties don't always march in step with the White House agenda,
[partisanship can count for a lot]{.underline}. Even within Jimmy
Carter's White House, which was notorious for clashing with
Congressional Democrats, party loyalty guaranteed a certain amount of
support. This means that Trump came into the White House at a
disadvantage. Although his victory has sparked a lot of interest in why
he won, the fact remains that he won fewer votes than Hillary Clinton
and a below-average share of the Electoral College for a winning
candidate. He also won with much less support from his own party than
most newly elected presidents have received. Moreover, he articulated
plenty of positions that were at odds with the GOP's usual stances (and
sometimes at odds with his own previous statements). This is especially
true on health care: During his campaign, Trump promised to cover more
people for less money, but that's not what the House and Senate bills
did, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates of their
impacts. [Finally, while the political conditions go a long way toward
determining how "strong" a president is, the White House needs a certain
amount of organization to take full advantage of them]{.underline}.
[First, when it comes to policy, the main advantage that the president
has over Congress is coordination]{.underline}. [While Congress has to
balance the ideas and opinions of 535 people, the executive branch can
theoretically speak with one voice]{.underline}. [Here the problems
within Trump's White House are about more than optics]{.underline}. [A
disorganized White House will have trouble developing a clear policy
agenda, setting priorities and coming up with ideas about how to achieve
them]{.underline}. [A troubled communications apparatus]{.underline} ---
like, for example, one where the communications director goes on an
expletive-filled tirade to a reporter and gets fired after less than two
weeks on the job --- [will have a hard time selling the president's
agenda to Congress and the public]{.underline}. While we see the end
product --- speeches, press conferences and, more recently, social media
--- [presidential communication involves hundreds of people and requires
focused coordination]{.underline}. [Direct communication with the public
is a major asset for presidents, but without effective organization,
they forfeit this advantage]{.underline}. [Trump, like all presidents,
doesn't have control over most of the levers that affect his ability to
influence Congress]{.underline}. [Presidents can only shape political
conditions so much]{.underline}. [But the levers he does have direct
control over --- his message, his organization --- are being pushed in
the wrong direction]{.underline}. [And the levers on which he has a more
indirect effect --- public support, party backing --- are also going the
wrong way]{.underline}. [Trump, in other words, has made a difficult
situation worse]{.underline}. [A strong presidency is built on more than
just tough talk]{.underline}. [Good organization may not get people
chanting at a campaign rally, but it's a big part of what makes a
presidency effective]{.underline}.

#### Trump doesn't know how to president

**BRYAN '17** (Bob; Business Insider, "\'Trump doesn\'t bring us any
votes\': Trump appears to be losing influence on healthcare,"
https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-healthcare-senate-brca-2017-6)ww

President Donald Trump made the pledge to repeal and replace Obamacare
one of the key issues of his 2016 election campaign. But as Republicans
try in earnest to make good on that promise, [Trump appears to be losing
influence]{.underline}. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said
Tuesday that GOP leadership would delay a vote on its healthcare bill,
the Better Care Reconciliation Act, until after the weeklong July 4
recess because of a lack of support among Republican lawmakers. Nine
members of the party have publicly said they would not vote for the bill
in its current form. McConnell can lose only two votes for the BCRA to
pass, as all Democrats are expected to oppose it. But Trump apparently
isn\'t helping GOP members get to \"yes.\" In contrast to his hard sell
on the House healthcare bill, The Washington Post and The New York Times
published reports late Tuesday saying Trump had done little to get the
reluctant GOP senators to come to an agreement. According to The Times\'
Glenn Thrush and Jonathan Martin, Trump has been \"on the sidelines\"
during the Senate negotiations. In fact, one Republican senator in favor
of the BCRA told The Times that the president \"did not have a grasp of
some basic elements of the Senate plan\" during a meeting with all of
the GOP members on Tuesday. The senator also said Trump was confused
when a moderate expressed concern that the bill would be seen as a tax
break for the rich. A Tax Policy Center analysis showed that the top
0.1% of earners in America would receive, on average, a \$207,390 tax
break from the BCRA. The Times also reported that Republican senators,
including McConnell, expressed frustration with ads from a pro-Trump
nonprofit group attacking GOP Sen. Dean Heller for going against the
BCRA. Heller is up for reelection in Nevada come 2018 and faces an
uphill battle in a state Democrat Hillary Clinton won in last year\'s
presidential election. A senior Republican close to both the Senate and
the White House also told The Post that [Republican lawmakers thought
Trump was a \"paper tiger\" and did not mind going \"their own
way.\"]{.underline} [The lack of deference]{.underline}, according to
The Post, [comes from a feeling among lawmakers that Trump lacks an
understanding of policy and that his low approval numbers do not give
him much political capital]{.underline}. \"Trump doesn\'t bring us any
votes. He just doesn\'t,\" a source close to McConnell told Politico.
President Donald Trump in the Rose Garden of the White House on Monday.
AP Photo/Evan Vucci Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate GOP holdout on the
Senate legislation, also criticized Trump\'s approach to the process
while talking with reporters on Tuesday after the delay was announced.
\"[This president is the first president in our history who has had
neither political nor military experience]{.underline},\" Collins said.
\"[Thus, it has been a challenge to him to learn how to interact with
Congress and how to push his agenda forward]{.underline}. I also believe
it would have been better had the president started with infrastructure,
which has bipartisan support, rather than tackling a political divisive
and technically complicated issue like healthcare.\" Lawmakers were
already wary of Trump\'s turnaround on the House bill. In just a few
weeks, the president went from a White House Rose Garden ceremony
celebrating the bill\'s passage to calling the bill \"mean\" during a
private meeting with senators. Trump last weekend confirmed in a
national TV interview that he called the bill \"mean.\" Trump\'s
comments have become a rallying point for Democrats\' attacks on the GOP
healthcare effort and have already appeared in political ads. Trump used
Twitter on Wednesday morning to push back on the Times and Post reports.
\"The failing \@nytimes writes false story after false story about me.
They don\'t even call to verify the facts of a story. A Fake News
Joke!\" Trump tweeted. \"Some of the Fake News Media likes to say that I
am not totally engaged in healthcare. Wrong, I know the subject well &
want victory for U.S.\" Trump also attacked The Post as \"the guardian
of Amazon not paying internet taxes\" and \"FAKE NEWS.\" Amazon CEO Jeff
Bezos owns The Post privately, and the two entities do not have a
business connection. Tax experts have debunked Trump\'s suggestion that
The Post helps Amazon avoid taxes.

#### Plan is massively unpopular -- tanks support for Dems

**EXUM '17** (Andrew; Former U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense
for Middle East Policy and Contributing Editor to The Atlantic, "What
Progressives Miss About Arms Sales," 5/23,
https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/americas-right-to-sell-arms/527805/)ww

Whew! For once, one of my predictions was correct: Donald Trump had a
great visit to Saudi Arabia. It was a great visit for him, it was a
great visit for the Saudis and the other Arab Gulf states, and---last
but not least---it was a great visit for magical, glowing orbs. I want
to spend a little time talking about one of the reasons why the trip
went so well. I'll warn you: This is a somewhat taboo subject for
progressive foreign-policy types. The subject, friends, is arms sales.
[Progressives don't like [arms sales]{.mark} very much, but they need to
pay attention to them, because they're [one big way Republicans are
fighting for]{.mark}---and winning---[the votes of working-class
Americans]{.mark} who have traditionally voted for
Democrats]{.underline}. While the president was in Saudi Arabia, the
Trump administration announced \$110 billion in arms sales to Saudi
Arabia---with an additional \$240 billion committed over a 10-year
period. If you've ever worked in government, you know this is what is
called a "deliverable," the clunky management-consultantese term for a
tangible outcome of a visit or meeting. When Donald Trump is asked to
justify his trip to Saudi Arabia, he'll cite that \$110 billion in arms
sales. There are a few interesting things about these sales. The first
is that many of these sales were already in the works. The Obama
administration spent eight years quietly selling a lot of arms to Saudi
Arabia: When President Obama left office, for example, the United States
still had \$100 billion in the foreign military sales pipeline with
Saudi Arabia and, in 2011, had inked what was previously the largest
arms sale in U.S. history with the Kingdom---a \$29 billion deal to sell
F-15s to the Saudis. Obama-era sales to Saudi Arabia were in keeping
with sales to other Gulf states: Both Qatar and the United Arab Emirates
bought a tremendous amount of U.S. arms between 2009 and 2017. Qatar
bought more U.S. arms than any other state in 2014 and, in the waning
days of the Obama administration, announced that it would buy nearly \$4
billion in Boeing-made F-15s in addition to \$19 billion in commercial
aircraft, also from Boeing. Overall, the Arab Gulf states went on a
spending spree during the Obama years, and most of the money was spent
on American arms. So why didn't you hear a lot about this from
Democratic politicians during the 2016 election season? There are two
main reasons---one strategic and one moral. Strategically, not everyone
is convinced that arming the Arab Gulf states to the teeth is a wise
idea. Some worry that these arms might someday endanger Israel's
security, while others worry the Arab Gulf states might be encouraged to
use their new toys on disastrous military interventions against Iran or
Iranian proxies in, say, Yemen. The quick and unsatisfying answer to
these concerns is the global market. The Arab Gulf states have money,
and that money will buy the weapons that are available. If U.S. arms are
not for sale, fine: French, Chinese, or Russian arms will be. (And if
you don't believe me, look at the way in which Gulf states---frustrated
by U.S. export controls on drone technology---are turning to the
Chinese.) Selling U.S. arms to the Gulf states, by contrast, further
ties them to U.S. interests by deepening cooperation and
interoperability between the U.S. military and its Gulf partners. One of
the reasons Qatar wanted to buy U.S. fighters to partially replace its
French-made fleet, for example, was because they discovered how
difficult it was for their existing fighter aircraft to fly with the
U.S. air force as part of coalitions over Libya and Syria. Arms sales
also drive down the cost of our own weapons and thus the amount of money
U.S. tax-payers have to spend on defense instead of other priorities
like, say, the State Department, school lunches, or housing subsidies.
Here's one example: Because the United States is buying fewer F-35s than
originally planned and using more of its "fourth generation" fighters
(F-15s, F-16s, etc.) in the skies over Iraq and Syria than previously
anticipated, the Department of Defense will likely need to buy more of
those fourth generation fighters in the coming years. The recent sales
of F-15s to Qatar, F-18s to Kuwait, and F-16s to Bahrain will drive down
the cost per plane for the Pentagon. That's a good thing---at least
financially. [Morally, though, many progressives just grow ill at the
idea of selling weapons abroad]{.underline}. Senator Chris Murphy, for
example---one of the more eloquent and consistent critics of U.S. arms
sales in the Senate, even though his own state has a very robust defense
industrial base---sees nothing admirable about the idea of selling
weapons to the Saudis that might be used in Yemen. Other progressives
agree: Yes, they argue, we understand the demand of the market will be
met by someone, but do we have to be complicit in providing the supply?
In other countries, progressives have even taken to the courts in an
effort to halt sales. I have a lot of respect for these progressives and
their values. I spent too much time in Sunday School as a kid to not
feel a little uneasy about the business of selling weapons. [And the
angst many progressives feel about U.S. arms sales has been enough to
keep many Democrats from talking up their successes in helping U.S.
industry abroad]{.underline}. [I wonder, though, if there isn't a real
political cost to not doing so]{.underline}. [[Boeing employs 157,000
people]{.underline}]{.mark}---almost all of them in the United States.
14,500 people work in Boeing's facilities in Missouri, where the F-15
and F-18 are made, where Senator Claire McCaskill is up for reelection
next year, and where Donald Trump trounced Hillary Clinton 56 to 38
percent in 2016. (Those 14,500 people do not include the many thousands
of other Americans who make parts for the F-15 and F-18 elsewhere in
America.) [[Lockheed Martin]{.underline}]{.mark}, meanwhile, a huge
winner in the recent arms deal with Saudi Arabia (despite ace

Saudis), [[employs]{.mark} an additional [97,000]{.mark}]{.underline}
workers---again, most of them in the United States. And
[[Raytheon]{.underline}]{.mark}, another big winner last week,
[[employs]{.mark} another [60]{.mark},[000]{.mark}]{.underline} or so
Americans. Donald [[Trump]{.mark} obviously [has no moral qualms]{.mark}
[about selling weapons]{.mark} to our partners and allies
abroad]{.underline}. [And so while Democrats leave points on the board
with working-class voters by not talking about how much Democrats do to
support U.S. industry, [Republicans swoop in to take credit with]{.mark}
[assembly line workers]{.mark}]{.underline} for even those things that
Obama approved and set in motion. [The way in which Trump brags about
U.S. arms sales]{.underline}, of course, [is in keeping with the strain
of economic mercantilism that ran through his populist campaign
message]{.underline}. [[That message worked with]{.mark} [voters]{.mark}
throughout the Midwest, [helping to cost Clinton the
election]{.mark}]{.underline}. [So while progressives might have moral
qualms about companies that sell weapons, [the]{.mark} roughly [1.2
million American voters who work in the aerospace and defense
sector---]{.mark}together [with the]{.mark} roughly [3.2 million]{.mark}
Americans [who support the sector]{.mark} indirectly---[see little wrong
with the sales]{.mark} that help ensure their livelihoods and provide a
future for their children]{.underline}. [This might be another area in
which progressive elites]{.underline}---who have the kinds of education
and skills that don't require them to seek work on the assembly
line---[are simply out of touch with the voters they need to win back
control of the Congress and state assemblies, never mind the
presidency]{.underline}. And politics aside, surely even the moral
calculus of arms sales gets more complicated when you think about the
millions of American mouths that are fed by mothers and fathers who work
in the aerospace and defense sector. Donald [Trump, for his part, is
speaking to those voters]{.underline}. [And even as progressives fret
about U.S. arms sales, they should also fret about what it will mean for
the rest of their agenda when Republicans claim credit for protecting
some of the last good assembly-line jobs in America]{.underline}.

which is not included in the baseline budget because wars are funded in
a separate and sterile-sounding part of the budget known as "overseas

the sequester cuts.
[Boeing](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/section/boeing) reported
spending more than \$15 million on lobbying in 2013 to lead the way,
followed by Lockheed Martin (\$14.4 million) and United Technologies

in the new budget. [[Congress is **preparing to approve all major

construction of several new [Virginia-class

\$90 million to upgrade existing [Abrams

authorized the spending for the tanks, even though the Pentagon proposed
halting production of the vehicles as a cost-saving measure. [Members of
**both political parties** and **both chambers** are to blame for the
**wasteful defense earmarks**]{.underline}, said David Williams,
president of the Taxpayers Protection Alliance. "[The picture has become
clearer with each '**bipartisan' agreement** we get from

agreed that Congress ultimately was responsible for keeping spending in

#### Arms Sales are massively popular

**THRALL and DORMINEY '18** (A. Trevor; Senior Fellow for the Defense
and Foreign Policy Department -- CATO Institute, AND Caroline; Former
Policy Analyst in Defense and Foreign Policy -- CATO Institute, "Risky
Business: The Role of Arms Sales in U.S. Foreign Policy," Policy
Analysis No. 836, 3/13,
https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy)ww

What role should arms sales play in American foreign policy? Though
major deals --- like Trump's \$110 billion agreement with Saudi Arabia
announced in 2017 or the decision to sell arms to Ukraine --- provoke
brief periods of discussion, there is no real debate in Washington about
the wisdom of exporting vast quantities of weapons around the globe to
allies and nonallies alike. [Congress, which has the authority to cancel
arms deals, has not impeded a deal since the passage of the 1976 Arms
Export Control Act created the framework for doing so]{.underline}.
Since 9/11 the pace of sales has increased. From 2002 to 2016, the
United States sold roughly \$197 billion worth of weapons and related
military support to 167 countries.1 In just his first year Donald Trump
cut a deal worth as much as \$110 billion to Saudi Arabia alone and
notified Congress of 157 sales worth more than \$84 billion to 42 other
nations.2 Despite losing market share over the past two decades because
of increasing competition, the United States still enjoyed the largest
share of the global arms trade between 2012 and 2016 at 33 percent.3
[The current consensus in favor of arms sales rests on three
planks]{.underline}. [First, advocates argue that arms sales enhance
American security by bolstering the military capabilities of
allies]{.underline}, enabling them to deter and contain their
adversaries, and helping promote stability in critical areas like the
Middle East and Southeast Asia. [Second, they argue that arms sales help
the United States exert influence over the behavior and foreign policies
of client nations]{.underline}. [Finally, advocates argue that arms
sales provide a boon to the U.S. economy]{.underline} and fiscal
benefits in the form of lower unit costs to the Pentagon, while helping
ensure the health of the American defense industrial base.4 We argue,
however, that Washington's faith in the wisdom of foreign arms sales is
seriously misplaced. [The benefits tend to be oversold, and the
downsides are often simply ignored]{.underline}. The defense industry
and its champions, in particular, have long exaggerated the economic
boon of arms sales.5 And even if they were greater, economic benefits
alone are not worth subverting strategic considerations. More
importantly, the strategic deficits of arms sales are severe enough to
overwhelm even the most optimistic economic argument. It is the
strategic case for and against arms sales that we consider in this
analysis.

### A/T: NAFTA Pullout

#### No Impact -- failure will just lead to re-negotiation

**SEN '18** (Ashish Kumar; deputy director of communications at the
Atlantic Council "Why it Will Be Hard to Kill NAFTA if Congress Does Not
Approve Trump's Trade Deal With Mexico and Canada," 12/14,

Despite US President Donald J. Trump's threat to pull the United States
out of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), it will be much
harder to kill NAFTA if the US Congress does not approve a revised trade
deal, said Jesús Seade, who served as then Mexican President-elect
Andrés Manuel López Obrador's chief NAFTA negotiator in recently
concluded, and often contentious, negotiations. Trump has threatened
action as a way to force members of Congress---Democrats as well as
Republicans---to ratify the recently concluded US-Mexico-Canada
Agreement (USMCA). "If the new treaty doesn't pass, NAFTA will be more
resilient and more difficult to kill," Seade said at the Atlantic
Council's Annual Forum in Washington on December 14. In such an event,
Seade said he "wouldn't see a lot of political capital \[expended\] in
also dumping NAFTA." The Mexican and US governments would instead
"probably resume negotiations to have something smaller and less
contentious," he said. Seade is undersecretary-designate for North
America in Mexico's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He participated in a
discussion moderated by Sabrina Rodríguez, a trade reporter with
Politico.

### A/T: Economy Impact

#### USMCA not key to the economy -- Multiple Studies

**LYNCH 4/18** (David J.; Washington Post, "Trump's USMCA trade
agreement would have a limited but positive impact on U.S. economy,
report finds,"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trumps-usmca-trade-agreement-would-have-a-limited-but-positive-impact-on-us-economy-report-finds/2019/04/18/b8ccb48c-6200-11e9-9ff2-abc984dc9eec_story.html)ww

President [Trump's new North American trade deal will have a marginal
effect on the]{.underline} nearly \$21 trillion [U.S. economy, boosting
output by just 0.35 percent and delivering an even smaller gain to the
labor market, according to an independent analysis by the International
Trade Commission]{.underline}. In a 379-page report released Thursday,
the ITC said the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement would "have a
positive impact" on both manufacturing and services industries. The
largest gains would arise from eliminating "uncertainty" by preventing
future barriers to cross-border e-commerce, services and investments.
"There can be no doubt that the USMCA is a big win for America's
economy," said Robert E. Lighthizer, the president's chief trade
negotiator. Notably, [the deal would increase auto parts production and
employment]{.underline}, key administration goals. [But the narrow
benefits for the auto sector would come at the expense of the broader
economy, making overall U.S. production more expensive, reducing
exports, and denting wages and employment]{.underline}, the report said.
Congress required the assessment, which was delayed five weeks by the
partial government shutdown, before lawmakers hold an up-or-down vote on
the agreement. "I don't see it as providing much ammunition to either
side. The skeptics will still be skeptical, and the advocates will still
be advocating," said William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies. Administration officials are
pushing for quick congressional action, but most trade analysts expect
the process to drag on for months. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)
has said tougher enforcement measures need to be written into the deal
to make sure that Mexico complies with promised labor reforms. Several
prominent lawmakers, including Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa),
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, say the president must remove
tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Mexico and Canada before a
vote. Both countries have imposed retaliatory measures that have damaged
U.S. exports, especially from farm states. Administration officials said
last year that the tariffs would be eliminated once the three countries
reached a new trade deal. But instead, they have remained in place while
the United States tries to get Mexico and Canada to accept quotas on
their shipments of industrial metals. "This report confirms what has
been clear since this deal was announced --- Donald Trump's NAFTA
represents at best a minor update to NAFTA, which will offer only
limited benefits to U.S. workers," said Sen. Ron Wyden, (D-Ore.), the
committee's ranking member. The USMCA provides for the free flow of data
among the three trading partners, an important step for banks, airlines,
online retailers and entertainment companies. It limits an existing
procedure for companies to settle disputes with the three governments,
which the report says will discourage U.S. investment in Mexico and
boost capital spending in U.S. manufacturing and mining. An overhaul of
the 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, the changes in the
USMCA are less sweeping than the broad elimination of virtually all
trade barriers in the earlier accord, economists say. NAFTA was expected
to increase the size of the U.S. economy by just 0.5 percent and boost
employment by less than 1 percent, according to the ITC's 1993 study.
Those effects exceeded what's likely from the new deal, including an
employment gain of just 176,000 jobs, or 0.12 percent, according to the
ITC. "Most trade deals don't have an outsized effect on growth over the
long term," said David Page, senior economist for AXA Investment
Managers in London. "It does tend to be a little bit peripheral." While
its top-line effects are modest, the deal would reshape North American
auto production by requiring more American content and mandating that 40
percent of each vehicle be produced by workers earning \$16 per hour ---
aimed at steering jobs away from lower-wage Mexican workers. The
administration sought to preempt the report, releasing an assessment
that concluded the deal would create 76,000 auto jobs over the next five
years and trigger \$34 billion in new auto plant investments and \$23
billion in added auto parts purchases. Current auto industry employment
is about 999,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. [The ITC
study comes after a recent International Monetary Fund study cast doubt
on USMCA's effectiveness, saying the agreement would reduce trade among
the three North American neighbors, have a "negligible" effect on
economic output and fail to bring auto jobs back to the United
States]{.underline}. "The new rules lead to a decline in the production
of vehicles and parts in all three North American countries, with shifts
toward greater sourcing of both vehicles and parts from outside of the
region," the IMF paper said. [The deal also would have no impact on
inflation-adjusted wages in the United States or Canada while resulting
in a slight decline for Mexican workers]{.underline}. [Consumers also
would face higher prices and thus buyer fewer vehicles, the study
said]{.underline}. A senior official in the Office of the U.S. Trade
Representative denigrated the IMF study as reflecting the "opinions" of
its authors. The more favorable USTR conclusions were derived from
confidential business plans that major automakers submitted to the
government and that were more reliable than economic modeling, the
official said. "We have unique insights," said the official, who
insisted on anonymity to brief reporters. Changing North American trade
rules is especially important as the auto industry gears up for major
investments in autonomous and electric vehicle production, the official
said. The new deal should result in more next-generation plants in the
United States rather than in Mexico, the official said.

#### The benefits are small and likely overstated

**SCOTT 4/23** (Robert E.; Senior Economist and Director of Trade and
Manufacturing Policy Research -- Economic Policy Institute, "And if you
believe this, I've got a great deal to sell you,"
https://www.epi.org/blog/and-if-you-believe-this-ive-got-a-great-deal-to-sell-you-the-economic-impacts-of-the-revised-nafta-usmca-agreement/)ww

The North American Free Trade Agreement resulted in growing trade
deficits with Mexico and steep U.S. job losses after it was implemented
in 1994, increasing the bilateral trade gap by at least \$97.2 billion
and costing at least 682,900 jobs through 2010. Can NAFTA 2.0 do any
better? The U.S. International Trade Commission's (ITC) new report on
the economic impact of the U.S.---Mexico--Canada Trade Agreement,
released last week, projects that the revised NAFTA (USMCA) will have
tiny impacts on the economy. The ITC estimates the deal will increase
GDP by 0.35% when it is fully implemented (six years after it takes
effect), or roughly 10 weeks of growth. Similarly, it projects that
175,000 jobs will be added in the domestic economy, a 0.1 percent
increase in total employment (based on CBO projections for the economy
in 2025), or roughly as many jobs as the economy adds in a normal month,
over the next six years. And it claims real wages will rise about
one-quarter of a percentage point (0.27 percent), roughly 4 percent of
what workers are expected to gain, in real terms, over the next six
years, if promised gains in output and employment are realized. But
there are strong reasons to doubt that these gains will be achieved. The
ITC results show that the deal will yield remarkably small gains, and
those gains rest on questionable assumptions about how the deal will
help workers and the economy. Perhaps the most problematic finding in
the ITC study (p. 25) was that labor provisions in the USMCA "would
increase Mexico union wages by 17.2 percent, assuming that these
provisions are enforced." Given that unionization rates in the durable
goods sectors of Mexican manufacturing are reported to be 20.2 percent
(Table F.4), these would be massive impacts, indeed. Yet Mexican workers
will not benefit unless there are mechanisms to ensure that labor rights
enforcement does improve, but those provisions do not yet exist in the
agreement. Thus, it is not surprising to find that the AFL-CIO, other
labor unions, and many members of Congress are demanding that "swift
\[and\] certain enforcement tools" are included in the deal before it is
submitted to Congress. These concerns also apply to segments of the
agreement that pertain to the environment, access to medicines.
Furthermore, the assumption that Mexican union wages will increase 17.2
percent seems especially heroic, within the 6-year adjustment period in
the ITC model (p 23.), in light of the struggles that will be required
to unionize such a large share of the labor force. The ITC's economic
impact projections are built on a series of heroic assumptions that are
built into its "computable general equilibrium (CGE) model." The ITC
model assumes the economy is always at full employment; that trade deals
do not cause trade imbalances, job losses, growing income inequality, or
downward pressure on the wages of most workers, and environmental
damages;, and that the more expensive drugs, movies and software don't
otherwise harm consumers or the economy. In particular, the ITC study
assumes that the overall U.S. trade balance is unchanged by the deal
(despite its significant changes in the rules of governing, trade, labor
and the environment). Peter Dorman pointed out the problems with CGE
models nearly two decades ago, as have many others, and yet the ITC
staff, and other economists keep using them anyway. ITC studies of the
impacts of trade and investment deals have a particularly poor track
record of projecting the actual pattern of trade following recent trade
deals. In addition to being wrong about the overall size and direction
of trade flows, the ITC also failed to "correctly identify the winning
and losing industries in trade with Mexico and Korea." The ITC claimed
(Table 2.2) the US-Korea KORUS deal would improve that trade balance,
but the trade deficit increased, costing more than 95,000 American jobs.
And the most infamous, 1999, ITC estimate (Tbl. ES-4) was that China's
entry into the WTO would increase the bilateral trade deficit by about
\$2 billion after the deal is fully implemented. At last count, that
deficit is up \$272 billion, costing 3.4 million U.S. jobs. The ITC's
claims about supposed (net) benefits of the NAFTA-2 (USMCA) deal stand
in contrast to those of several other studies. Researchers from the
International Monetary Fund recently used their own CGE model to
estimate the economic impacts of the trade deal. They found that the
USMCA, alone, would result in slight increases in welfare for Mexico and
Canada and a small net welfare loss of \$794 million for the United
States. Some of the most important, and controversial, changes to the
NAFTA agreement, embodied in the USMCA, involve new rules of origin
(ROO) that raise the level of regional content for motor vehicles, parts
and some other products (including steel and aluminum in vehicles) which
must be achieved in order to qualify for special, duty-free treatment
under the agreement. New standards were also developed for labor value
content (LVC) that require certain minimum shares (40 to 45 percent) of
cars and trucks must be produced with labor earning at least US\$16 per
hour. \[1\] The ITC report estimates that the USMCA's ROO and LVC
requirements would increase net employment in U.S. auto and parts
production by more than 28,000 jobs, and that U.S. investment will
increase by "\$683 million per year to meet new demand for U.S. produced
engines and transmissions. (ITC report 19)." But these findings are
certainly controversial. In their recent IMF working paper, Burfisher,
Lambert and Matheson, found that the USMCA agreement (alone) would
result in a small (\$275 million) increase in the U.S. trade deficit,
and that the negative sectoral impacts would be more significant. In
particular, they found the agreement would reduce output of motor
vehicles and parts in all three countries by an average of 0.8 percent
(\$7.6 billion), and by 0.2 percent in the United States alone. Higher
vehicle costs (due in part to tariffs) will reduce vehicle demand, and
some auto and parts production is likely to shift to lower wage
locations such as China, Vietnam or Malaysia. This finding stands in
contrast to the ITC assumption that the USMCA will increase motor
vehicle production in the United States.. It is time for a new approach
to analyzing trade deals. The CGE models are built to analyze the
impacts of reducing tariffs on trade. But deals such as the USMCA are
about much more than trade in goods and increased efficiency in the
economy. They are trade and investment deals, and their most important,
negative effect on U.S. workers is that they make it attractive for
multinational companies to offshore production to low wage countries
such as Mexico. The CGE models make gross, simplifying assumptions about
how non-trade issues affect workers and the economy, and yet provide an
unearned degree of perceived rigor about these effects, when, in fact,
they are assuming answers rather than carefully exploring their impacts.
The USMCA nibbles at the edges of the USITC trade model, and the basic
approach to negotiating trade deals, but doesn't appear to change its
basic tenets.. The USMCA will continue to encourage firms to offshore
production. The locations may change, from Mexico and Canada to China,
Vietnam or Malaysia, but the results will remain the same. These
negotiations, and the models used to assess their impacts, aren't
getting the job done for working Americans. It's time to go back to the
drawing board, for all of us.

### A/T: Trade Impact

#### Trump has damaged US trade too much -- USMCA can't overcome

**DIAZ 6/18** (Hugo; deputy director of international law at the Centre
for International Governance Innovation, "Think trade agreements will
mend relationships with the U.S.? Think again,"
https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-think-trade-agreements-will-mend-relationships-with-the-us-think/)ww

The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) -- which will replace
the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) -- has largely been
received with enthusiasm. U.S. President Donald Trump called it a "very,
very good deal." Former Mexican secretary of economy Ildefonso Guajardo
said that Mr. Trump's trade threats had \"practically been defused"
thanks to the agreement. Jesus Seade, who then-president-elect Andres
Manuel Lopez Obrador appointed as his chief NAFTA negotiator, added that
the agreement would bring certainty and stability to trade in North
America.

The agreement was reason for Canada to celebrate, too, and it elicited
at least a sigh of relief from other countries around the world,
particularly those engaged in trade negotiations with the United States.
There has been some sense of renewed hope that deals will bring the
superpower back to our decades-long global trajectory toward an
international system of trade rules, and rein in the worst protectionist
impulses of Mr. Trump, whose zero-sum approach assumes that one
country's gain is another country's loss.

But the USMCA does little to modernize or upgrade the 25-year-old NAFTA
beyond what had been achieved in the Obama administration's negotiations
of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement; in fact, it actually
backtracks in important areas, such as in the automobile sector, where
stricter rules of origin will reduce the competitiveness of North
American industry. And with trade escalation with China, and the
imposition of tariffs on Mexico (which, if Mr. Trump is to be believed,
resulted in action on migration on the southern border), it is evident
that, regardless of any trade agreements, new or old, Mr. Trump will
continue to use the U.S.\'s economic might and tariffs to push his
policy objectives. And rather than being a pursuit of policy goals, it
is far more likely that the reason is Mr. Trump's hardened instinct for
electoral gains.

The USMCA features plenty of other hints of Mr. Trump's enduring
anti-trade sentiment. Although many dismissed the change of name as
innocuous, it is no coincidence that the word "free" was dropped from
the title. But more importantly, in an exchange of side letters attached
to the deal, Mexico and Canada recognized that the U.S. can impose
tariffs on any products imported from Mexico or Canada for alleged
national-security reasons. Although they also recognize both countries'
right to retaliate if the U.S. were to impose such tariffs, these
letters clearly reflect a move in the opposite direction from free
trade.

Signing the USMCA didn't even really help Ottawa or Mexico City. The
U.S. didn't remove the 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum products that
it had imposed on Mexico and Canada in May 2018 until a year later --
after Mr. Trump had further escalated his trade war with China -- in
exchange for both countries removing the tariffs that each of them had
imposed on U.S. goods in retaliation. And then it took only a few days
for Mr. Trump to threaten, yet again, to levy tariffs not only on steel
and aluminum products from Mexico, but on all goods imported from there,
for reasons unconnected to trade: Mexico's performance on stemming the
northward flow of migrants. Mr. Trump appears to be pursuing his
immigration-policy objectives to cater to his political base as the 2020
presidential elections draw nearer.

Even the migration deal that has since been struck between the U.S. and
Mexico is no reason to celebrate, as Mr. Lopez Obrador did last week
after claiming victory in the three-day long negotiations that prompted
what Mr. Trump calls an "indefinite\" suspension of the tariffs on all
Mexican goods. Despite the optimism being expressed around the power of
trade deals to nudge the U.S. back toward certain norms, we can be sure
this will not be the end of Mr. Trump's deployment of trade weaponry.
Mexico, Canada and the rest of the world should heed the writing on the
wall.

### A/T: Agriculture Impact

#### Retaliatory Tariffs swamp any benefit to agriculture from USMCA

The modest market access improvements in the USMCA will lead to an
expansion of U.S. agricultural exports by \$450 million, mostly in the
dairy and poultry sectors. However, the retaliatory measures taken by
Canada and Mexico, in reaction to the U.S. decision to raise tariffs on
their exports of steel and aluminum, will cause U.S. agricultural
exports to decline by \$1.8 billion, and by \$1.9 billion to these key
trading partners. In today's broader context of reactive trade
retaliation from countries around the world, the United States would see
a decline in agricultural exports of \$7.9 billion, thus overwhelming
the small positive gains from USMCA.

The Trump Administration has renegotiated NAFTA, the North American Free
Trade Agreement, to reach a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico, the
U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement or [USMCA]{.underline}. While the deal may
be an overall positive for the United States, it [exposes U.S. fruit and
vegetable growers to a high risk of substantial harm through unfair
competition from Mexican imports]{.underline}. This policy brief
explains the economic damage Georgia fruit and vegetable growers are
likely to suffer unless some provisions of the USMCA are renegotiated.
[In recent years Mexico has greatly expanded]{.underline} the weeks
during which [their imports]{.underline} compete directly with Georgia
fruits and vegetables. Georgia blueberries are ripe and hit the market
before blueberries grown in Northern states and Georgia's climate is
also well-suited to fall vegetables such as tomatoes, peppers, squash,
cucumbers, and eggplants. Georgia's natural seasonal advantage has been
diminished by Mexican imports arriving during Georgia's selling season
at prices well below Georgia's production costs. [Mexico has
accomplished this expansion of import supply over a longer season by a
government-subsidized surge in protected growing acres]{.underline}
(greenhouses and high tunnels). Administered by SAGARPA, Mexico's
equivalent to the USDA, [this policy of subsidies]{.underline}, started
in 2009 and known as the Strategic Project for Protected Agriculture,
[has led the acreage planted]{.underline} to blueberries and vegetables
grown [in Mexico to increase greatly and has lengthened the weeks each
year when Mexico can bring its crops to market]{.underline} at the same
time as Georgia. Since 2009 Mexico's protected production area has grown
from 25,000 acres to over 100,000 acres.1 [Worse still, thanks to the
government subsidies and the lower labor costs]{.underline} (about one
tenth of U.S. labor costs) [the costs of the Mexican imports is often
less than one half the price American growers were receiving before the
Mexican imports arrived]{.underline}. [Crucially, the new USMCA as
currently constituted contains no provision to protect American
producers from seasonal damage or government subsidies, providing no
remedy or relief mechanism to preserve the ability of American growers
to compete fairly with Mexican imports]{.underline}. [Thus]{.underline},
unless the current deal is amended, [these Mexican imports can cause
extensive economic damage to]{.underline} Georgia (and
[American]{.underline}) [fruit and vegetable growers with no remedy
available to American growers]{.underline}. The impact of Mexico's
policy of subsidizing the expansion of protected acreage for small fruit
and vegetable production can be seen quite clearly in Figures 1 and 2
which show the relative trends in production of blueberries and major
vegetable crops in both Mexico and Georgia. Modeling the Economic Losses
To model the potential damage from the USMCA as it currently stands,
this policy brief presents three scenarios compared to the status quo
and evaluates the possible loss of jobs, income, and economic output
under those different scenarios. All scenarios and dollar figures below
focus only on the most affected crops so far: blueberries, bell peppers,
cucumbers, eggplants, squash, and tomatoes. Based on other reporting of
Mexican acreage expansion and the observed drops in prices the past few
years when Mexican imports entered the U.S. market, the three scenarios
were constructed as follows. The estimated economic damage from
government-subsidized Mexican producers is confined to blueberries and
the vegetables listed above; although other crops may be at risk, these
were deemed the crops most at risk for Georgia's fruit and vegetable
growers. If Mexico expands production in a similar manner into other
vegetables, Georgia vegetable growers could face even greater economic
difficulties. Further, the baseline production values are based on the
three-year average over the period of 2015-2017; this included some
smaller blueberry crops due to weather. These combined modeling choices
mean the estimates of potential economic damage below are likely on the
conservative side with the possibility that reality will be even worse.
The baseline scenario of no further damage to the Georgia blueberry and
vegetable industries is based on average production of the last three
years, \$590.1 million. Three alternative scenarios were then
hypothesized: one of mild additional damage, one of medium additional
damage, and one of catastrophic damage to Georgia's blueberry and
vegetable growers. These scenarios are detailed in Table 1 below, with
decreases in Georgia production of these crops specified in production
value (quantity times price) capturing the reality that losses will
occur as a combination of reductions in prices (from competing with
subsidized Mexican imports) and decreases in production (due to lower
profitability). Losses are anticipated to be higher in crops Mexican
growers have already moved strongly into and somewhat smaller in crops
for which they currently have fewer acres. One way to think about the
three scenarios, based on the current trends of protected acreage
expansion in Mexico is the mild damage scenario is what is forecast to
occur within the next one to two years, the medium damage scenario would
be expected within three to four years, and the catastrophic damage
scenarios should become reality within five to eight years. The baseline
and each of these three scenarios were then run through IMPLAN, an
economic impact modeling software package, to estimate the total
economic value of each of the four levels of economic activity in the
combined Georgia blueberry and vegetable industries within the state of
Georgia. IMPLAN calculates the jobs supported by economic activity, the
labor income earned, state and local taxes paid, and the total economic
output generated by the original activity being modeled plus all the
multiplier effects of that money circulating through the Georgia
economy. That is, a grower earns money and spends it at the local
chemical and fertilizer company, the supermarket, the car dealer, a
local mall, eating out at restaurants, etc. All that spending helps
support other jobs and the money that those workers earn also gets
recirculated, creating another round of spending. Each round of spending
gets smaller as some money "leaks" out of the Georgia economy when we
buy products produced outside the state of Georgia. IMPLAN sums up all
these rounds to compute the total economic activity created by that
original activity. In our case, the original activity is the growing and
selling of blueberries and vegetables in Georgia. The impact of Mexico's
subsidies for protected small fruit and vegetable production and the
inability of Georgia growers to defend against that under the currently
negotiated USMCA are presented below in Table 2. The results above make
clear that Georgia's economy would suffer a significant blow unless the
new trade agreement is amended. The potential job losses represent an
increase in state unemployment of 0.2%, which is a 5% increase from the
current level of 3.9%. The damage will be felt much more severely in
Georgia's rural communities and by Georgia's agricultural sector. To
make the regional impacts clearer, IMPLAN was also used to calculate the
impact of each scenario on the ten counties in Georgia that currently
have the highest dollar value of blueberry and vegetable production.
Table 3 below summarizes the results in the case of catastrophic damage,
highlighting the potential income loss in these key production counties
and the income loss as a percentage of total county income. What Table 3
shows quite clearly is that in three Georgia counties (Bacon, Clinch,
and Echols), a continuation of the current trend for Mexican imports of
blueberries and vegetables without some ability to offset that damage
would lead to truly breathtaking income losses. For a county to lose
over 40% of its income, as Clinch and Echols are forecast to experience,
is economic damage on the scale of the Great Depression. In four
additional counties (Appling, Brooks, Colquitt, and Decatur), the
percentage drop in incomes is in the range of 2 to 5% equivalent to what
is commonly experienced during an economic recession. Thus, while the
state of Georgia could withstand the economic damage forecast here, a
number of counties would be particularly hard hit, with damage similar
to past recessions or even the Great Depression for the three counties
hardest hit. Conclusions The conclusion of this modeling exercise is
that [if the new USMCA is approved as currently negotiated, without any
recourse for American farmers to seasonal damage from Mexican
government-subsidized production, the economic losses]{.underline} to
the Georgia blueberry and vegetable industries [will be
considerable]{.underline}. The state is on track to lose nearly one
billion dollars in annual economic output and over 8,000 jobs unless
something occurs to slow down the increase in lowpriced Mexican imports
of blueberries and vegetables. On a county-by-county basis, [the
losses]{.underline} in a few cases [will likely reach economic damage
rarely seen since the Great Depression]{.underline}.
