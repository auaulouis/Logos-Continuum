Months?\", 9/22/17,

As tensions with North Korea are heating up, a [prominent South Korean
nuclear physicist said his country can build a nuclear weapon
in]{.underline} just **[six months]{.underline}**.

In a newly released Korean-language article in Chosun Monthly , Kune Y.
Suh, an [MIT-trained nuclear engineer at Seoul National University,
argues that South Korea needs to build its own nuclear arsenal to deal
with the threat posed by Pyongyang]{.underline}. When asked if Seoul is
capable of producing such a weapon, Suh argued that [the country could
use its]{.underline} **[huge stockpile of plutonium]{.underline}** [to
build an operational nuclear weapon in six months]{.underline}.

Suh didn't go into detail about how Seoul could accomplish this feat,
which is notable because its plutonium stockpile largely consists of
what many dismiss as "unusable" reactor-grade plutonium. But [clues to
how South Korea could overcome this challenge were offered at an
event]{.underline} our employer, [the Nonproliferation Policy Education
Center, hosted]{.underline} on Capitol Hill on September 14 for a
visiting delegation of Japanese Diet members. That event, which [focused
on the plutonium stockpiles in northeast Asia]{.underline}, featured an
eye-opening presentation by Bruce Goodwin, a Senior Fellow at the Center
for Global Security Research at the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory. At the event, Goodwin, one of America's top nuclear weapons
designers and plutonium experts, thoroughly **[debunked the
myth]{.underline}** [that countries cannot use so-called reactor-grade
plutonium to build nuclear weapons]{.underline}.

[Reactor-grade plutonium refers to plutonium that has a larger
percentage of the isotope Pu-240 compared with weapons-grade plutonium,
which has a higher mix of the isotope, Pu-239. Many have contended that
the high level of Pu-240 makes reactor-grade plutonium unsuitable for
nuclear weapons because it would require too large of a critical mass,
is too radioactive to handle, and is prone to a condition called
"pre-initiation,"]{.underline} which is when the nuclear chain reaction
begins too soon producing a minimal explosive yield. As the World
Nuclear Association has put it , "any significant proportions of Pu-240
in it would make it hazardous to the bomb makers, as well as probably
unreliable and unpredictable" for use in nuclear weapons.

[Goodwin's presentation exploded each myth]{.underline}, which persist
even though the United States tested a reactor-grade-plutonium nuclear
device in 1962. First, he noted that the [critical mass for
reactor-grade plutonium in nuclear weapons is only two kilograms larger
than weapons-grade plutonium]{.underline}, and [much less than using
highly enriched uranium. The reason why many believe a much larger
critical mass is needed with reactor-grade plutonium is because Pu-240
is not very fissionable with the slow neutrons]{.underline} present in
nuclear reactors. On the other hand, Goodwin explained, "[Pu-240 is a
good fissile material with fast neutrons and fast neutrons drive nuclear
explosives]{.underline}." The irony here, Goodwin pointed out, is that
reactor-grade plutonium works better for nuclear weapons than in
reactors.

The [radioactivity differences between reactor and weapons-grade
plutonium are also negligible]{.underline}. To be sure, reactor-grade
plutonium is over three times as radioactive as its weapons grade
counterpart, but the differences would have to be "several factors of
ten" to seriously inhibit handling of the material. In fact, Goodwin's
presentation noted, "In newly built facilities, handling reactor grade
is essentially the same as handling weapons grade Pu."

The [problem of pre-initiation, while real, is also
overblown.]{.underline} As Goodwin points out, the Department of Energy
released a report in 1997 that stated that ["even if pre-initiation
occurs at the worst possible moment (when the material first becomes
compressed enough to sustain a chain reaction) the explosive yield of
even a relatively simple first-generation nuclear device would be of the
order of one or a few kilotons]{.underline}." This is the absolute
minimum yield, and in all likelihood, it would be much higher even for a
first-generation device. Nonetheless, "a one-kiloton bomb would still
have a radius of destruction roughly one-third that of the Hiroshima
weapon, making it a potentially fearsome explosive."

Furthermore, that same Department of Energy report noted that advanced
weapon states, like [Russia and the United States, "could produce
weapons from reactor-grade plutonium having reliable explosive yields,
weight, and other characteristics generally comparable to those of
weapons made from weapons-grade plutonium]{.underline}." Goodwin assured
the audience that "having done this myself I can tell you that this is
quite true." He also stated: "I suspect that [the industrialized states
of Asia would be similarly capable to the United States and Russia in
making such weapons." It is also worth noting that South Korea has one
thousand bombs' worth of]{.underline} **[tritium]{.underline}**. This
can be [used to boost fission weapons and totally eliminate the risk of
pre-initiation.]{.underline}

[Suh is therefore correct that South Korea's reactor-grade plutonium can
be used to build a nuclear arsenal]{.underline}. Still, its plutonium
stockpile is of the unseparated variety and, unlike Japan, Seoul doesn't
have a commercial-sized reprocessing plant. Wouldn't this prevent South
Korea from building nuclear weapons in the six-month timetable that Suh
outlines?

Not necessarily. [South Korea]{.underline} and other countries [could
possibly build a small reprocessing plant in that time]{.underline},
according to a 1977 Oak Ridge National Laboratory memo written by Floyd
L. Culler. In the memo, Culler outlines how [a country could secretly
build a chemical reprocessing plant with a capacity to process 150 tons
of irradiated fuel per year]{.underline}. Assuming the plant was
designed to process one PWR assembly per day (recovering about five
kilograms of plutonium per day), Culler estimated [it would take four to
six months to build such a facility, with the first ten kilograms of
plutonium becoming available about one week after operations began. Such
a plant could be built covertly in a relatively small area in a
warehouse or some other unsafeguarded area,]{.underline} such as the
Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute's Underground Research Tunnel,
which is currently used for research on the geologic disposal of spent
fuel and high-level radioactive waste. To be sure, it might take South
Korea longer than six months, especially to field an operational nuclear
weapon. Still, [it's]{.underline} **[undeniable]{.underline}** [that
Seoul would be able to]{.underline} **[make a nuclear weapon without
much difficulty]{.underline}**.

While President Moon Jae-in has vowed not to build a nuclear weapon, a
majority of South Koreans want the bomb, as do many members of the
opposition party. [If Seoul chooses to go this route, or continues to
hint at it, Japan and China will likely ramp up their nuclear weapons
options as well]{.underline}.

Going Nuclear

In the ongoing debate over the future of South Korea's national security
strategy, it is emotional arguments, not logical ones, that are likely
to have the most salience.

South Korean conservatives, including Hong Joonpyo, current chairman of
the main opposition Liberty Korea party, have seized on the nuclear
weapons issue to distinguish themselves from Moon and his liberal
government.

If the Moon administration bungles the North Korea issue, as previous
liberal governments have done with their own failed "sunshine" policies
of aid-for-denuclearization, South Korean conservatives could be elected
back into power, as most experts agree is eventually inevitable.

Traditionally, about 40 percent of South Koreans are conservative and 25
percent to 30 percent are liberal, according to Kim Ji-yoon, the polling
expert.

"They will resurrect and \[South\] Korea will still be a conservative
country, thanks to North Korea," she predicts.

Just as Republicans were hardened during the Obama years, reacting to
what they viewed as dangerous liberal overreach in both the domestic and
foreign policy realms, South Korean conservatives are trying out various
policy arguments against Moon as he embarks on a risky diplomacy push
with Pyongyang. But it's the organized and mobilized hard right and not
the moderate conservatives in Seoul who have the microphone right now.

[South Korea has never had the historical aversion to nuclear weapons
that neighboring Japan has had. For decades, South Korea was pronuclear,
viewing the United States' use of the atomic bomb]{.underline} in the
final days of World War II as [the thing that finally freed the Korean
Peninsula from]{.underline} the yoke of [Japanese
colonization]{.underline}. It's [only in the last few
decades]{.underline}, and particularly [under]{.underline} the influence
of the [Obama]{.underline} administration, that [the language of nuclear
nonproliferation]{.underline} and nuclear security [became a common
public value]{.underline}, experts say.

Traditionally, [security issues such as North Korea and the U.S.
alliance affect South Koreans' voting decisions more than comparable
defense matters do for American voters]{.underline}, says Woo
Jeong-yeop, a polling expert with the conservative Sejong Institute.

During an interview at his organization's spacious offices on the
outskirts of Seoul, he notes that [even some South Korean liberals are
open to a domestic nuclear weapon because they view it as a sovereignty
issue and a way to wean themselves off relying on the United
States]{.underline} for their defense. Historically, South Korean
conservatives have been much more pro-United States than liberals.

[Support for "South Korea's nuclearization" has slowly **ticked up**
from almost 56 percent in 2010 to **nearly 65 percent** in
2016]{.underline}, according to Asan Institute polling. Both pronuclear
and anti-nuclear analysts agree, however, that support is mostly
lukewarm, with the hard right being the most fervent nuclear backers.

Conservatives argue this [latent support could be **"catalyzed"** into
an active political movement if]{.underline} the North Korean nuclear
crisis worsens and public **[doubts grow about the reliability of the
U.S. security umbrella.]{.underline}**

On the other hand, liberals say the existing tepid support would likely
fade if South Koreans were better informed of all the economic,
diplomatic and security tradeoffs the country would make in order to
secure either a U.S. tactical nuclear weapon deployment or, and even
more so, an independent atomic arsenal.

Still, the most notable increase of [support for some sort of nuclear
weapons]{.underline} option has been [found within South Korea's
elites]{.underline}, including a small number of liberal academics. And
as [South Korea]{.underline}---unlike the United States---[has a largely
top-down political culture, the views of the party leadership are
largely adopted by the rank-and-file.]{.underline}

#### South Korea is completely [capable]{.underline} and [willing]{.underline} to go nuclear even after the 123 deal -- breakout would be fast

Yi **Whan-woo** 5-11-20**15**; Korea Times; \'Seoul may build nuclear
arms if NK threat grows\' US report
http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2015/05/116_178256.html

South Korea may seek to develop its own nuclear weapons if the United
States and China continue to fail in their efforts to get North Korea to
abandon its nuclear program, according to a U.S. report. [The
report]{.underline}, obtained by Yonhap News Agency, Monday, [was
privately circulated by]{.underline} Federation of American Scientists
([FAS]{.underline}) President Charles Ferguson **[at a closed-door
meeting of nuclear experts]{.underline}** in Washington D.C. on April
27, the Seoul media outlet said. [The report argues that Seoul can build
**dozens of nuclear bombs in a short time period** because it is capable
of making and transporting nuclear warheads and its nuclear reactors
already have enough plutonium to make such weapons]{.underline}. Such
claims came after South Korea and the United States struck a deal over
the revision of their 1974 nuclear cooperation agreement on April 22.
[The deal opens the door for Seoul to expand its commercial use of
nuclear energy]{.underline} in accordance with the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation (of Nuclear Weapons) Treaty (NPT). The report,
however, states Seoul may violate the NPT and consider joining the
nuclear arms race if it determines that Pyongyang\'s nuclear threat
reaches a level which Washington and Beijing cannot control. The report
claims Japan\'s possible attempt to acquire nuclear weapons may trigger
Seoul to develop such weapons on its own. It is speculated that [South
Korea will recycle spent fuel instead of enriching uranium to build
nuclear bombs, according to the report. **Seoul won the right to deal
with spent nuclear fuel**]{.underline}, [secure a stable supply of
nuclear fuel and promote the export of nuclear power plants in its
agreement]{.underline} with the U.S. on April 22. **[The two sides also
agreed to lift the \"gold standard\" that legally binds U.S. partners
not to perform uranium enrichment and reprocessing.]{.underline}**

[Given Seoul's mixed nonprolif]{.underline}eration [record
and]{.underline} the 1992 [denuclearization agreement]{.underline} that
disallows enrichment or reprocessing technology on the Korean peninsula,
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[and]{.underline} key [regional states]{.underline} such as Japan and
China [are concerned about South Korea launching]{.underline} [programs
that involve such tech]{.underline}nologies. They fret that because of
[South Korea's other]{.underline} [capabilities]{.underline}, such as
[in missile tech]{.underline}nology, the possession of such technologies
[could bring the country **within a few months of being able to build a
nuclear weapon**]{.underline}. They also worry that [South Korea's
action might make it]{.underline} even **[more difficult to convince
North Korea to return to the terms of the 1992 denuclearization
agreement]{.underline}**. South Korean officials counter that the United
States and China long have had this concern about Japan's extensive
reprocessing program as well, but that the United States has granted
Japan permission to reprocess U.S.-origin fuel. In contrast to South
Korea, however, Japan developed its reprocessing program before U.S.
views on reprocessing changed in the mid-1970s following India's test of
a "peaceful nuclear explosive," which used plutonium from reprocessed
spent fuel. Also, Tokyo did not agree to restrictions such as those
included in the Korean denuclearization agreement and has no known
violations of its IAEA safeguards agreement.

### 2NC -- Yes Prolif -- Japan 

#### Japan could make [6000 nukes]{.underline} and is [stockpiling plutonium]{.underline} for [rapid conversion]{.underline}

**Rich 18** \[Motoko, Tokyo bureau chief for The New York Times \"Japan
Has Enough Nuclear Material to Build an Arsenal. Its Plan: Recycle.,\"
9-22-2018,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/22/world/asia/japan-nuclear-weapon-recycle.html>\]

ROKKASHO, Japan --- [More than 30 years ago]{.underline}, when its
economy seemed invincible and the Sony Walkman was ubiquitous, [Japan
decided to build a recycling plant to turn nuclear waste into nuclear
fuel]{.underline}. It was supposed to open in 1997, a feat of advanced
engineering that would burnish its reputation for high-tech excellence
and make the nation even less dependent on others for energy.

Then came a series of blown deadlines as the project hit technical snags
and struggled with a Sisyphean list of government-mandated safety
upgrades. Seventeen prime ministers came and went, the Japanese economy
slipped into a funk and the initial \$6.8 billion budget ballooned into
\$27 billion of spending.

Now, [Japan Nuclear Fuel Ltd., the private consortium building the
recycling plant, says it really is **almost done.**]{.underline} But
there is a problem[: Japan does not use much nuclear power any
more]{.underline}. The [country turned away from nuclear energy after
the 2011 Fukushima disaster]{.underline}, and only nine of its 35
reactors are operational.

It is a predicament with global ramifications. While waiting for the
plant to be built, [Japan has amassed a stockpile of **47 metric tons of
plutonium, raising concerns about nuclear proliferation**]{.underline}
and Tokyo's commitment to refrain from building nuclear arms even as it
joins the United States in pressing North Korea to give up its arsenal.

In August, North Korea's state-run Rodong Sinmun newspaper accused Japan
of accumulating plutonium "for its nuclear armament."

[Japan pledged]{.underline} for the first time this past summer [to
reduce the stockpile]{.underline}, saying the recycling plant would
convert the plutonium into fuel for use in Japanese reactors.
[But]{.underline} if the plant opens as scheduled in four years, [the
nation's hoard of plutonium could grow rather than shrink.]{.underline}

That is because [only four of Japan's working reactors are technically
capable of using the new fuel,]{.underline} and at least a dozen more
would need to be upgraded and operating to consume the plutonium that
the recycling plant would extract each year from nuclear waste.

"At the end of the day, Japan is really in a vise of its own making,"
said James M. Acton, a researcher at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace in Washington. "There is no easy way forward, and
all those ways forward have significant costs associated with it."

A handful of countries reprocess nuclear fuel, including France, India,
Russia and Britain. But the Japanese plan faces a daunting set of
practical and political challenges, and if it does not work, the nation
will be left with another problem: about 18,000 metric tons of nuclear
waste in the form of spent fuel rods that it has accumulated and stored
all these years.

Japan's neighbors, most notably China, have long objected to the
stockpile of plutonium, which was extracted from the waste during tests
of the recycling plant and at a government research facility, as well as
by commercial recycling plants abroad. Most of this plutonium is now
stored overseas, in France and Britain, but 10 metric tons remain in
Japan, more than a third of it in Rokkasho, the northeastern fishing
town where the recycling plant is being built.

Japan says it stores its plutonium in a form that would be difficult to
convert into weapons, and that it takes measures to ensure it never
falls into the wrong hands. But [experts are worried the sheer size of
the stockpile --- the **largest of any country without nuclear
weapons**, and in theory **enough to make 6,000 bombs** --- could be
used to justify a **nuclear buildup**]{.underline} by North Korea and
others in the region.

Any recycling plan that adds to the stockpile looks like "a route to
weaponize down the road," said Alicia Dressman, a nuclear policy
specialist. "This is what really concerns Japan's neighbors and allies."

Japan maintains that its plutonium is for peaceful energy purposes and
that it will produce only as much as it needs for its reactors. "We are
committed to nonproliferation," said Hideo Kawabuchi, an official at the
Japan Atomic Energy Commission.

But the launch of the Rokkasho plant has been delayed so long --- and
popular opposition to restarting additional nuclear reactors remains so
strong --- that skepticism abounds over the plan to recycle the
stockpile. Critics say Japan should concede the plant will not solve the
problem and start looking for a place to bury its nuclear waste.

"You kind of look at it and say, 'My God, it's 30 years later, and that
future didn't happen,' " said Sharon Squassoni, a nonproliferation
specialist at George Washington University. "It's just wishful thinking
about how this is going to solve their myriad problems."

Engineers have repeatedly revised the design of the plant to address
water leaks and earthquake safety, and it took years to develop a safe
way to dispose of hazardous byproducts. After the Fukushima disaster,
government regulators demanded even more safety measures.

Giving up on the recycling plant, though, would be politically
difficult, not least because Aomori Prefecture, where it is, has
threatened to send the 3,000 metric tons of nuclear waste stored here
back to communities around the country with nuclear plants.

[Pulling the plug would]{.underline} also [deprive one of Japan's
poorest regions of an economic lifeline]{.underline}. Over the years,
the central government has awarded nearly \$3 billion in incentives to
the prefecture, where political leaders reliably support Japan's
governing party. Even inoperative, the plant employs more than one in 10
residents in Rokkasho and accounts for more than half the town's tax
revenues.

"[It is now indispensable for Rokkasho]{.underline}," said Kenji Kudo,
the fourth generation to run his family's clothing distribution company,
which sells uniforms and protective gear to the plant. As demand from
local squid fishermen disappeared, he added, the plant "rescued our
business."

The town has also received more than \$555 million in government
subsidies for hosting the facility, including funding for a 680-seat
concert hall, an international school with just eight students and a new
pool and gym complex that opened last year.

There are small reminders that the munificence comes with some risk. A
screen in the lobby of the concert hall reports the radiation level at
32 places around the prefecture, and a sign at a local nursing home
warns residents not to use the baths "in case of nuclear disaster."

Kaoru Sasaki, director of the nursing home, said she doubts the plant
will ever operate, given concerns about nuclear power around the
country. "But we don't talk about that among friends here," she said.
"It is so important to the community."

The plant itself is sprawled across nearly 1,000 acres of farmland,
surrounded by fields of solar panels and wind turbines. Some 6,000
workers are now installing steel nets to protect it against tornadoes
and digging ditches for pipes to carry water from a swamp into its
cooling towers. Inside a large control room, workers in turquoise
jumpsuits mill about computer consoles, monitoring dormant machinery.

The final piece of the plant to come online will be a facility, now
under construction, that will take a mix of plutonium and uranium and
turn that into fuel. But no one knows what would happen if the
government cannot persuade communities to reopen and upgrade more
reactors to use this type of fuel.

"[Our only plan right now is that we want to start reprocessing in
2021]{.underline}," said Koji Kosugi, general manager for international
cooperation and nonproliferation at Japan Nuclear Fuel. "[But we do not
yet know how it will be consumed.]{.underline} [This is something that
has to be worked out with]{.underline} the utilities and [the Japanese
government."]{.underline}

[With the average age of the hibakusha]{.underline} now [over 80, and
Japanese society gradually leaving its pacifist and anti-nuclear roots
behind]{.underline}, however, [the security alliance with the United
States]{.underline} and the nuclear umbrella that it affords [are
increasingly crucial backstops for Japan's commitments to
nonproliferation]{.underline} and disarmament. [Without them, a nuclear
arms race could ensue in East Asia. If Japan pursued nuclear weapons, it
would upend efforts to restrict their spread]{.underline}, especially
[in East Asia.]{.underline} With the largest nuclear program of any
state outside the 9-member nuclear club, [Japan has long been a poster
child for nonproliferation.]{.underline} Besides its NPT membership, it
accepts the safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency --- the
global nuclear watchdog --- on activities ranging from uranium imports
to plutonium reprocessing. In 1998, it was the first to sign up for the
IAEA's voluntary Additional Protocol, which mandated even more
comprehensive and onerous inspections after the first Gulf War. The
Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs touts nuclear disarmament, and
officials of its Arms Control and Disarmament Division toil abroad in
support of international efforts to manage and eventually eliminate
weapons of mass destruction. [These attitudes]{.underline} and behaviors
[are often ascribed to the bombs' enduring impact on Japanese culture
and politics.]{.underline} An estimated 66,000 people were killed and
69,000 injured in Hiroshima, and another 39,000 and 25,000 in Nagasaki
--- in all, 250,000 to 300,000 died within 13 years. During the 7-year
U.S. occupation of Japan, U.S. authorities censored accounts of the
bombings and its radioactive aftereffects on the cities' populations.
Anti-nuclear sentiment flared again after an American H-bomb test went
awry in 1954, contaminating 7000 square miles of the South Pacific and
irradiating 23 crew members of a Japanese fishing vessel --- the Lucky
Dragon --- one of whom later died from radiation poisoning. The incident
gave rise to public outcry and anti-nuclear protests in Japan and was
featured in the godfather of all monster movies --- Godzilla. One year
later, Japan's parliament, the Diet, restricted domestic nuclear
activities to those with civilian uses, a norm which Prime Minister
Eisaku Sato further reinforced in 1967, when he introduced his Three
Non-Nuclear Principles: non-possession, non-manufacture, and
non-introduction of nuclear weapons. [Yet Japanese leaders' renunciation
of nuclear weapons has never been absolute. In private remarks, many of
Japan's prime ministers]{.underline} in the 1950s and 1960s [asserted
that the weapons would enhance their country's national security and
international standing.]{.underline} (This was partly a mark of the era,
when President Dwight Eisenhower insisted that he saw "no reason why
\[nuclear weapons\] shouldn't be used just exactly as you would use a
bullet or anything else.") [After China's first nuclear test in 1964,
Sato]{.underline} informed U.S. President Lyndon Johnson "that if the
\[Chinese\] had nuclear weapons, the Japanese also should have them." He
later [confided to the U.S. ambassador]{.underline} to Japan U. Alexis
Johnson [that the Three Non-Nuclear Principles were
"nonsense."]{.underline} Why then did Japan not build atomic bombs in
the 1960s? Mainly because the United States offered to share its own.
Security treaties signed in 1952 and 1960 granted the U.S. military
basing rights in exchange for protecting Japan. Those treaties were
silent on nuclear threats, however, so after China's nuclear test,
Johnson and his foreign-policy team devised various schemes to make U.S.
atom and hydrogen bombs available to Japan amid a crisis. In January
1965, Johnson inaugurated a tradition of American presidents vowing to
Japanese prime ministers, "if Japan needs our nuclear deterrent for its
defense, the United States would stand by its commitments and provide
that defense." These reassurances seemed to have their intended effect.
In 1967, Sato acknowledged the importance of extended nuclear deterrence
in a meeting with Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense
Robert McNamara: "The Japanese were well-protected by the U.S. nuclear
umbrella, and Japan had no intention to make nuclear weapons," he told
them. Afterward, Sato announced that extended nuclear deterrence also
formed a pillar of Japan's nuclear posture. When Sato's former Foreign
Minister Takeo Miki became prime minister in 1974, he convinced the Diet
to ratify Japan's acceptance of the NPT, thanks to President Gerald
Ford's reaffirmation that the U.S.-Japan security treaty encompassed
nuclear threats and the establishment of the Subcommittee on U.S.-Japan
Defense Cooperation, where the two countries' foreign and defense
ministers would thereafter meet to coordinate their common defense.
[Optimists claim that nuclear aversion, political checks, and
international commitments will prevent a Japanese nuclear breakout in
the future.]{.underline} After all, Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida ---
who hails from Hiroshima --- renewed calls to "accelerate nuclear
disarmament" at the NPT Review Conference this April, inviting world
leaders to visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki in order to "witness with their
own eyes the reality of atomic bombings." [And yet, Japan is becoming
increasingly ambivalent about its military restraint.]{.underline}
Before his speech in New York, Kishida finalized new arrangements with
the United States that encourage Japan to function "more proactively" in
East Asia. Prime Minister Shinzo [Abe is brushing aside widespread
public resistance to a Diet resolution that would authorize the Japanese
Self-Defense Forces to operate overseas]{.underline} for the first time
since World War II. During his first administration, in the wake of the
first North Korean nuclear test [in 2006, Abe declared that a limited
nuclear arsenal "would not necessarily violate" the pacifist
constitution.]{.underline} Tokyo affirmed its non-nuclear status in
2006, but [with North Korea testing medium-range ballistic missiles, and
China enhancing its conventional and nuclear forces amid the
contest]{.underline} of wills [over]{.underline} the disputed
[Senkaku]{.underline}/Diaoyu Islands, [another review seems inevitable.
In 2011, Shintaro Ishihara, the then powerful governor of Tokyo, even
called for Japan to build its own nuclear arsenal.]{.underline} A key
variable will be how Seoul reacts to Pyongyang's provocations. South
Korea is even more exposed to North Korean threats, and possesses an
advanced civilian nuclear program of its own. If it took the radical
step of nuclearizing, Japan would likely follow. And [if Tokyo invoked
North Korea's nuclear arsenal to withdraw from the NPT]{.underline},
which has a 90-day waiting period, [it could build its own in short
order. It has a growing defense industry recently freed from export
restrictions, mastery over missile technology thanks to its space
program, and a reprocessing facility capable of producing enough
weapons-useable plutonium to fuel more than 1000 bombs]{.underline} like
the one that leveled Nagasaki. Indeed, [if Japan wanted to, it could
probably develop basic explosives in less than a year and a
sophisticated arsenal in three to five years. Faced with an existential
crisis]{.underline}, however, [those numbers would plummet, as Tokyo
fast-tracked a national undertaking.]{.underline} For all of these
reasons, Washington needs Tokyo to play a more active role in regional
security. The bilateral Extended Deterrence Dialogue formalized
mid-level consultations in 2010; the meetings should expand to include
South Korea --- trilateral coordination is overdue. The United States
should continue urging Japan to invest more on conventional forces. For
decades, Japanese military spending has hovered around 1 percent of
gross domestic product. Even a half-percent increase would help offset
smaller U.S. defense budgets, reducing scenarios where U.S. nuclear
forces would have to be called on and increasing the credibility of U.S.
deterrent threats in East Asia as a result. [Hibakusha have educated
Japan and humanity about the lifelong harm that nuclear weapons can
inflict. Their advancing age is representative of the generational
changes facing Japan]{.underline}, however, [with profound implications
for its foreign policies. As Japan assumes a more active security role
in East Asia, it may be tempted to rethink its nuclear
options.]{.underline} With some experts promoting "tailored"
proliferation to U.S. allies to counter China's rise, [U.S.-Japanese
efforts to reduce nuclear risks regionally and worldwide appear
increasingly in jeopardy.]{.underline} The shadow of American power
still looms over Japan 70 years after two artificial suns rose over
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The nuclear partnership with Washington has
afforded Tokyo the security necessary to renounce nuclear weapons and
champion a world without them. [With Japan's nuclear restraint no longer
the article of faith it once was, the significance of]{.underline} the
nuclear [pacts struck decades ago will become ever more
consequential.]{.underline}

#### **Japan can nuclearize -- takes less than 2 years**

[It has been widely acknowledged that Japan possesses technical
capabilities]{.underline}, if not political will, [sufficient to develop
nuclear weapons. Japan currently operates 54 nuclear reactors, and is
the third largest nuclear power in the world. Japan owns a huge
stockpile]{.underline} (about 53 tons) [of plutonium,]{.underline}
stored in France, the UK, and Japan, [sufficient to be used to produce
over 1,000 nuclear weapons]{.underline}.22 From a more realistic
standpoint, Japan may lack both the experience and the facilities
necessary for manufacturing nuclear weapons on an immediate basis.
However [considering the fact that Japan possesses the three basic
facilities (enriched uranium concentrators; weapons-grade plutonium
production pile; and fuel reprocessing plants) to produce nuclear
weapons independently, it would not take more than 2 years for Japan to
develop nuclear weapons, once it made up its mind to do
so.]{.underline}23 In fact, [Japan has opted for non-nuclearization, not
because domestic constraints are insurmountable,]{.underline} but for
its own strategic reasons for disadvantaging independent
nuclearization.24 From an international perspective, Japan has fully
complied with the International Atomic Energy Agency verification
measures and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). However, it is
worth noting that there are only five nuclear states under the terms of
the NPT, four non-NPT nuclear states, and one undeclared nuclear state
in the world out of many non-nuclear normal countries. Thus, possession
of nuclear weapons does not serve as a proper criterion to judge the
normalcy of the country.

#### No tech barriers to proliferation\-\--centrifuges are easy

Peter **Dizikes 14**, citing Scott Kemp, Professor at MIT, "3 Questions:
Scott Kemp on rethinking nuclear security efforts," 5/21/14,
http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/3-questions-scott-kemp-rethinking-nuclear-security-efforts-0521

What is the best way to prevent countries from acquiring nuclear
weapons? The [vast majority of nonprolif]{.underline}eration [efforts
attempt to control access to]{.underline} sensitive
[tech]{.underline}nologies. However, [a new study by Scott Kemp, an
assistant professor in MIT's Department of Nuclear Science and
Engineering, suggests that this approach **might not be
working**]{.underline}. In an article published tomorrow in the journal
International Security, [Kemp examines the history of the most common
proliferation technology --- the gas centrifuge, used to extract a
weapon-suitable isotope of uranium from a larger supply of that
elemen]{.underline}t --- and finds that [existing nonproliferation
policies would not have stopped historical instances of its
developmen]{.underline}t. [Kemp]{.underline}, a former science advisor
for nonproliferation in the U.S. State Department, [argues that
governments need to reinvent how they look at]{.underline} nuclear
[prolif]{.underline}eration in the modern age, turning their attention
to the security threats and status symbols that motivate states to seek
nuclear weapons in the first place. He talked with MIT News recently. Q.
Why should nuclear nonproliferation efforts no longer focus on the
technological hurdles to weapons production? A. [The study looks
primarily at the gas centrifuge]{.underline}, which has become the
proliferation technology of choice. [We studied **the history of 21
centrifuge programs**; interviewed program technical directors from
nearly a dozen nations, including Pakistan and Iran; and studied the
technology requirements behind the centrifuge itself.]{.underline} We
concluded that [while technology was once a barrier, that barrier slowly
disappeared in the]{.underline} 19[70s and]{.underline}
19[80s,]{.underline} and [today there is really **no way** to stop
countries from producing centrifuges suitable for making nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} This is a very different conclusion than the
premise upon which the United States built its nonproliferation policies
back in the 1950s. [The engineering and manufacturing tools needed for
proliferation were state of the art]{.underline} back then, but [modern
technology has moved]{.underline} well [beyond those
requirements]{.underline}, and what was once difficult is now
surprisingly easy.
