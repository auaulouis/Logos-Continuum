#### Foreign Military Sales and Direct Commercial Sales by the US to Israel has single-handedly allowed Israel to expand its military to global proportions. These sales specifically make it possible for Israel to wage war against Palestine.

US-Israel Military Cooperation **[The US-Israeli military cooperation
dates back to the 1940s.]{.underline}** After World War I, Great
Britainbin its effort to curb the Arab struggle for independence in its
territories collaborated with the Zionists in their mission to colonize
Palestine to build a Jewish State. When Great Britain and France emerged
economically and military crippled from World War II, they lost grip
over their territories in the Middle East and were quickly replaced by
the US as the sole dominant power in the region. **[Washington became
the strongest backer of the campaign to disposes the Palestinians of
their lands to install a Jewish state by means of violence and coercion.
The US government saw that the Zionist colonization of Palestine as a
potential weapon against anti-imperialist struggle sand secure its
interests in energy resources in the region.]{.underline}** During the
heights of the Cold War, the US kept the Soviets out of the
Mediterranean by diverting the attention of Soviet-armed Syria and Iraq
towards Israel from Turkey, which had to be maintained within the
American bloc. During the Arab-Israeli War in 1973, the United States
implemented Operation Nickel Grass that overtly airlifted weapons to
Israel. Between October 14 and November 14, 1973, the Military Airlift
Command of the US Air Force flew 22, 325 tons of artillery, ammunition,
supplies, and even tanks to their ally fighting against the Syria and
Egypt. Stronger military ties were developed in the 1980s and onwards
through different agreements (see Table 1). The two governments worked
together to develop sophisticated military technology such as the
David's Sling counter-rocket and Arrow missile defense systems. Israel's
military research and development complex pioneered many cutting-edge
technologies used today, which include cyber weapons, robots, aerial
drones, sensors and electronic warfare systems, and advanced defense for
military vehicles. **[Despite limited manpower and resources, Israel's
armed force has become one of the world's most technologically advanced
militaries. It is the largest recipient of foreign military aid from the
US, which cover almost a quarter of the overall Israeli defense
budget.US military aid to Israel since the 1940s has amounted to around
USD 70 billion. Part of the aid is being used to purchase major weapons
systems from the US. Israel also enjoys the rare privilege of using a
substantial portion of US aid to source locally made weapons. Thus,
Israel was able to strengthen its local defense industry and became
capable of exporting large quantities of arms.]{.underline}** Currently,
Israel is the 10th largest arms exporter in the world. In 2006, Israel
aided its US ally against Iraq and Afghanistan by supplying it with
weapons worth USD 1.1 billion. **[The US has three weapons transfer
programs to channel USD 18.87 billion worth of weapons, ammunition
rounds and related equipment to Israel]{.underline}** between 2000-2009.
**[These programs are the Foreign Military Sales (FMS), Direct
Commercial Sales (DCS), and Excess Defense Articles (EDA), through which
the US Defense Department supplied Israel weapons and military equipment
numbering to 670 million. The US provided Israel 500 different
categories of weapons, which include items like tear gas canisters,
ammunition, high power rifles, military vehicles, and 93 F-16D fighter
jets. In 2007, the Bush Administration and the Israeli government signed
a Memorandum of Understanding for a 10-year (2009 -- 2018) USD 30
billion military aid budget. The MOU still provides Israel the exemption
of spending more than a quarter of US military aid (26.3%) on its own
domestic weapons industry while all other recipients of US military aid
are required to spend it only on weapons and materials manufactured by
US corporations. The US also gives another \$504 million to fund
research, development, and production of Israel's Iron Dome anti-rocket
system (\$235 million), the David's Sling (\$149.7 million), the Arrow
improvement program (or Arrow II, \$44.3 million), and Arrow III (\$74.7
million)]{.underline}** (see Box 2. US-Israel Defense Projects).
US-Israel Economic and Business Partnerships Aside from military aid,
the US provides economic assistance to Israel, which amounts to around
USD 30 billion since the 1940s. Loan guarantees are also provided to
help Israel borrow from other sources at lower interest rates. USD 10
billion in loan guarantees was approved by the Congress to assist Israel
absorb the mass of immigrants coming from Russia and other Eastern bloc
countries after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The US helped
finance the resettlement of European Jews, who survived the Nazi's
anti-semitic purges, in the lands of Palestine through its immigration
aid. This provided the Zionists thousands of Jews to reinforce its
movement for a Jewish state, and also to prevent Jewish immigrants from
resettling in non-Nazi Europe and US soil. The Migration and Refugee
Assistance grant has reached USD 1.7 billion since the 1940s.
Partnerships in business and science were also inked between the two
countries. Leading US companies such as the IBM, Intel, General
Electric, Imation, Microsoft, and Texas Instruments invest in Israel and
have set up technology incubators. Likewise, Israeli start-ups partner
with US companies in developing software applications such as instant
messaging, internet telephony and data mining. US Aid to Palestine In
total, Israel received more than USD 123 billion from the US since 1949
until 2014. In contrast, Palestine received only around USD 5 billion
from the US since the 1990s. In 2013,total US aid to Palestine amounted
to USD 426.7 million. This is less than a quarter (roughly 15%) of what
Israel received in military aid alone from the US in the same year (USD
3.1 billion). This aid is also rife with conditionalities, including
withholding aid if it will be used to support Hamas and the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO),and if Palestine will seek membership in
the United Nations and in other UN Specialized agencies. In November
2012 during a similar conflict in Gaza, the US showed staunch support
for its ally when it voted against Palestinian Statehood along with
Israel and 7 other countries, while 138 other countries voted yes. To
punish Palestine, the US withheld aid amounting to USD 295. 7 million.
Israel acted in the same fashion, withholding around USD 100 million in
taxes that it is supposed to remit to Palestine. This resulted into a
public deficit so huge that the Palestinian Authority (PA) cannot pay
the salaries of public sector workers. New threats of withholding aid to
Palestine were made by Congress in April 2014 after Palestine signified
its intent to sign on to 15 UN affiliated bodies.\[1\] Again, Israel
withheld USD 100 million worth of taxes, a move to which US called
"unfortunate." Conclusion **[The massive amount of aid provided by the
US makes it fully complicit and responsible for Israel's genocide in
Gaza.]{.underline}** Since the 1940's, the US has stood by its ally to
secure their mutual interests in the region, which include keeping
energy resources in Middle East open to access by corporations based in
the US and other Western countries. Israel as the US military outpost in
the region has served as a potent threat to neighboring oil-producing
countries to toe the line drawn by US policies. The attacks in Gaza are
directly related to Israel's desire to control the gas fields in
Palestine's marine territory to avert an impending energy crisis. United
Kingdom's British Gas and US Company Noble Gas have already lined up to
invest in the gas field.\[2\] The US-Israel partnership is made stronger
through the passing of the US Senate legislation to provide emergency
funds amounting USD 225 million for Israel's Iron Dome. Additionally,
the US Senate Resolution 498 condemns unprovoked rocket fire and calls
on Hamas to stop all rocket attacks on Israel.Recently, the US clearly
stood against human rights when it solely voted against the proposal to
establish an inquiry into Israel's Gaza offensive by the UN Human Rights
Council. **[People's movements and civil society around the world should
condemn and continue exposing the US-Israel partnership in the genocide
of the Palestinians. The international community should pressure the US
to withdraw its military aid and projects from Israel and recognize
Palestine's right to freedom and self-determination.]{.underline}**

#### These settler colonial technologies of Israeli genocide operate through a "right to maim" that refuses to allow the colonized to die. Such a state produces a population where, perversely, death becomes desired. This violence breaks the very logic of impact calculus.

III\. The Biopolitics of Settler Colonialism **[These practices of
bodily as well as infrastructural debilitation]{.underline}**, loosely
effaced in concerns about 'disproportionate force', **[indicate the
extension or perhaps the mutation of the 'right to kill' claimed by
states in warfare into what I am calling the 'right to maim'. Maiming as
intentional practice expands biopolitics beyond simply the question of
'right of death and power over life'; maiming becomes a primary vector
through which biopolitical control is deployed in colonized space and
hence not easily demarcated 'necro' as it is mapped in Mbembe's
reworking of biopolitics.]{.underline}** That is to say, **[while the
distinctions between living and dying are often recognized through the
'cuts' of race and the 'folds' of overlapping population construction
and management, maiming, debilitation, and stunting are relatively
under-theorized components of these cuts and folds; centering these
processes may potentially alter presumed relations to living and dying
altogether.]{.underline}** Alongside examining how and why Foucault
elided a theory of colonial occupation in his formulation of
biopolitics, we might also ask, **[what is biopolitics in the 21st
century---and especially as informed by the ongoing structure of settler
colonialism?]{.underline}** Recent interventions by **[Alex Weheliye and
Mel Chen continue to raise critical issues about the formulation of race
in the theorization of biopolitics]{.underline}** (Weheliye 2014; Chen
2012). According to Weheliye, race only became important to Foucault
when it entered European state management, not through colonialism. For
this, Weheliye argues that the frame of biopolitics is foundationally
flawed, for even as Foucault claims that the cut of race drives
biopolitical distinctions, the severing of colonial occupation from a
(belated) state racism relegates race to a derivative status. Weheliye's
rather loose archival excavations of Foucault's work notwithstanding,
**[what his and others analyses lay bare is the dearth of theorization
of the biopolitics of colonial regimes, especially that of settler
colonialism, of colonialism as a structure and not an
event]{.underline}** (Wolfe 1999; Wolfe 2006). Further, **[Scott
Morgensen rightly notes that settler colonialism remains
undifferentiated within theorizations of the biopolitics of colonialism,
continuing the propagation of colonialism as a bygone event or within a
naturalized frame of periodization]{.underline}** (Morgensen 2011).
Foucault's frame of biopolitics is intrinsically dedicated to variations
of bodily health and vulnerability. In Security Territory Population, he
details the different regimes of power associated with distinct
illnesses. Leprosy is defined through the sovereign power to exclude;
the plague through disciplinary power of quarantining; and smallpox
becomes managed and regularized as epidemic through what Foucault calls
'regimes of security', Foucault's formulation of regimes of security
informs much of what Gilles Deleuze would later understand as integral
to 'societies of control' (Deleuze 1997, p. 177). **[In Society Must Be
Defended Foucault writes: '... biopolitics will derive its knowledge
from, and define its power's field of intervention in terms of, the
birth rate, the mortality rate, various biological disabilities, and the
effects of the environment']{.underline}** (Foucault 2003, p. 245).
**[Here, disability is understood as a biologically produced rather than
a socially induced condition.]{.underline}** In some sense **[Foucault
is inadvertently already mapping the liberal elision between disability
as an unfortunate accident or circumstance and disability as intrinsic
to the function of colonial war machines. 'Biological disabilities' are
thus distinct from the way illness is something that shifts from
epidemic to endemic; the endemic modulates 'the form, nature, extension,
duration, and intensity of the illnesses prevalent in a population ...
as permanent factors which ... sapped the populations' strength,
shortened the work week, wasted energy, and cost money, both because
they led to a fall in production and because treating them was
expensive']{.underline}** (Foucault 2003, pp. 243-4). **[Within the
context of emergent forms of social welfare that Foucault speaks to,
illness needs to be reduced, contained, isolated, and in some cases
abandoned, because it compromises the thriving of the 'make live'
vector. What is clear in contemporary biopolitics is that economic life
can grow without the flourishing of much of human life, which means
precisely that the eliminated and cordoning off of illness is no longer
a hindrance to, but rather is implicated in, 'make live'.]{.underline}**
As Foucault writes, 'The \[old\] right of sovereignty was the right to
take life or let live. ... And then this new right is established: the
right to make live and to let die' (Foucault 2003, p. 241). Foucault
notes that sovereignty's old right was not replaced, rather complemented
by this new right 'which does penetrate it, permeate it' (p. 241).iii
Given the interpenetrations of sovereign and biopolitical power, one
mapping we must continually be alert to is what forms of the sovereign
right to take life or let live are machinating. **[The sovereign right
to maim implicates all of the other vectors at once---make die and make
live]{.underline}** (because disablement can be productively harnessed
into rehabilitation) **[as well as let live and let die, or what Lauren
Berlant has dubbed 'slow death'.]{.underline}** In Berlant's framing,
**[slow death refers to a population marked for wearing out, a gradual
decay of bodies that are both overworked and
under-resourced]{.underline}** (Berlant 2007). **[Maiming functions as
slow but simultaneously intensive death-making, as targeting to maim is
an accelerated assault on both bodily and infrastructural fronts.
Different temporalities of living and dying labor here, a different
modulation of time and a reworking of the temporalities of biopolitics,
the stretching of the horizon of life (what can bare life bear?) and the
finality of death into perverted versions of life that look and feel
neither like life nor death, not even attenuated death.]{.underline}**
In this complication of the temporalities and processes, **[the speed of
biopolitics turns not through distinctions between fast and slow, quick
and languorous, but rather the intensification and amplification of
'life itself', and in fact, 'resistance itself' as a target of neglect,
damage, and speculative rehabilitation.]{.underline}**iv If slow death
is conceptualized as primarily through the vector of 'let die' or 'make
die', **[maiming functions as 'will not let die' and]{.underline}**, its
supposed humanitarian complement, **['will not make die'. Maiming
masquerades as 'let live' when in fact it acts as 'will not let die'.
For example, the IOF policy of shooting to maim, not to kill, is often
misperceived as a preservation of life.]{.underline}** In this version
of attenuated life, neither living nor dying is the aim. **[Instead,
'will not let die' and 'will not make die' replaces altogether the
coordinate 'make live' or 'let die'. It is not only the right to kill
but the right to maim being exercised as the domain of sovereignty. What
kind of sovereignty is being articulated when the right to kill is
enacted as the right to disable, to target both bodies and
infrastructure for disablement? This element of biopolitics entails
targeting for death but not killing. Israeli state practices of
occupation and settler colonialism may well be
rationalized]{.underline}**, through the conventional parameters of
living and dying in Foucault's four quadrants of biopolitical
management. The work of Eyal Weizman, Sherene Seikaly, and others have
shown, that **[the calories they allow into Gaza, the plotting of the
number of deaths of Hamas members, the transit of fuel, materials,
supplies, all of these parameters are mediated by expert language,
algorithmic calculations, and rational science and framed in a discourse
of humanitarian war.]{.underline}** **[Thus what I am explicitly arguing
is that from the discursive and empirical evidence offered by
Palestinians, this foundational biopolitical frame is a liberal fantasy
that produces 'let live' as an alibi for colonial rule and thus indeed
facilitates the covert destruction of 'will not let die'. It is from the
vantage of the occupied]{.underline}**, I argue, and not from state
power nor from the outlook of the occupier, **[that we must apprehend
and contend with revising]{.underline}**---challenging, in fact---**[the
theorization of the mechanisms of violent biopolitical population
creation and maintenance.]{.underline}** How is 'will not let die'
expressed? How is the distinction between death and debility mined? And
how does this capitalization of this distinction occur while
simultaneously obscuring the practices of deliberate maiming? **[The
debilitation of the Gazan infrastructure is elaborated in this statement
from Maher Najjar, the Deputy General of Gaza's Coastal Municipalities
Water Utilities (CMWU): There is no water reaching any of the houses
right now. We\'re facing a real catastrophe. Sewage pumps cannot work
because the power plant has been destroyed, so we have sewage flooding
the streets of Gaza. We can\'t assess the extent of the damage as we
can\'t even go out without risking our lives right now. We had five
staff members killed while doing repair work, another two were killed at
home with their families. It will take more than US\$20 million to
rebuild the water and sewage networks, but there\'s no way they can be
rebuilt under blockade. We have the total collapse of all essential
services and there\'s nothing we can do about it. Believe me, it would
be better if the Israelis just dropped the nuclear bomb on Gaza and get
done with it. This is the worst ever assault on the Gaza
Strip.]{.underline}** (Quotation provided by Schembri 2014; partially
quoted in Al-Helou & Waters 2014) Here, **[debilitation is proffered as
a fate worse than death.]{.underline}** Treating Najjar's statement as
political speech more so than the 'truth' of death as a form of mercy,
the strategy of this speech is perhaps to expose the absolute farce of
Israel's 'let live' praxes. **[To suggest that the Gazan population is
better off dead is surely to mock Israel's liberal democratic investment
in humanitarian gestures of 'let live'.]{.underline}** Najjar sharply
contests this investment with a vision of humanitarianism that is
startling. **[It is as if withholding death---will not let or make
die--- becomes an act of dehumanization: the Palestinians are not even
human enough for death.]{.underline}** Further, **[death is preferable
to disability, a stance that contravenes the human rights model of
disability. Why maiming is especially striking in this historical moment
is because in the face of the rise of disability as a recognized
vulnerable identity in need of state and global human rights
protections, seeking to debilitate, or to further debilitate the
disabled, contrasts heavily with the propagation of disability as a
socially maligned condition that must be empowered to and through a
liberal politics of recognition.]{.underline}** Beyond the twisted
hypocrisy of the Israeli state in regards to disabilities (which I
examine at length in 'Disabled Diaspora, Rehabilitating State', a
chapter in my forthcoming book, States of Debility and Capacity)
**[sanctioning maiming, which is distinct from sanctioning the
'collateral damage' of civilian deaths, bespeaks a profound failure in
the global human rights framing of disability as a protected and
supported social difference---protected and supported unless it is part
of the war tactic of a settler colonial regime, one financially
buttressed by the United States.]{.underline}** This is all the more
ironic given that Israel is a signatory on the United Nations Convention
for the Rights of People with Disabilities (Schulze 2010) (as well as
for the UNC for the Rights of the Child). Not to mention this other
contortion of the relation between the cripple and the disabled: Gaza
has a Paralympics team, one that is actually much more successful than
the main Olympic team (Al-Mughrabi 2012; Degun 2012).

#### Settler colonial violence in its embracement of the sovereign right to maim connects colonial and racial violences from Gaza to Ferguson. It is the very metaphysics of genocide which emerge in Israeli occupation.

Jasbir Puar's work in **[The Right to Maim is crucial to understanding
not only that the nature of settler colonialism is genocidal but also
how that genocidal nature operates. Settler colonialism
is]{.underline}**, in each and every case, **[a state
operation]{.underline}**, but the more fucked up--and therefore
better--way to put this, because it bears at least a tiny potential to
shock, is that in each and every case, the state is a settler colonial
operation. Moreover, as Puar teaches us, **[the statist, settler
colonial operation, in its genocidal nature, is given in the horrific
resonance, the brutal articulation, the asymptotic non-convergence, of
killing and maiming. In thinking]{.underline}**---along with and by way
of Puar---**[the unlikely and unavoidable locale of Ferguson, Gaza we
encounter the instrumental rationality through which this bloody
reverberation is ceaselessly achieved and announced. What she helps us
see is that genocide is regulation unto the vanishing point of
extermination; it is savage attenuation carried out and on with all
deliberate speed. We can kill them one by one, they say, and this will
have been interminable.]{.underline}** They can't kill us all, we say,
but regulation is given in the interminable series of my black death.
Then, we're talking our way out of their freedom because it's not just
that freedom and slavery are in the same place but that their
entanglement constitutes that place. Puar is a vital and indispensable
part of the chorus that allows and requires us to ask, **[what if the
terms and conditions of the ongoing genocide we survive, but wherein
each and every one of us will have been murdered, is way deeper than,
and cannot be encompassed by, the intimate opposition of slavery and
freedom, exile and home, occupation and sovereignty?]{.underline}** Such
militantly anti-military thinking requires considering another
irreducible entanglement---that of blackness and indigeneity. This
requires understanding, along with Robin D. G. Kelley, that Africa is a
field of indigeneity violated by settler colonial incursion's constant
articulation with the constant articulation of slavery and freedom,
given in what Hortense Spillers might call extended intramural, as well
as extramural, catastrophe. Indeed, Afro-diasporic life, both within the
continent of Africa and in all of its transoceanic variants, doesn't
just bear the trace, but is, more fundamentally, the residual of
settler-colonial violation, recognizing that residuality, in the complex
intra-activity of displacement and derivation, refuge and refusal, that
it bears, can never be reduced to being either the effect or creation of
the violator. So that the entanglement of blackness and
indigeneity--given in a mode of solidarity that will have never been
wholly voluntary in its ongoing emergence from and as something way on
the other side of what is manifest in the coalitions of political
subjects and their state or pre-state formations--is constantly
disbursed in habits of displacement and sub-communal movement whose
energy the political propriety of settlement comes to regulate and
consume. Such disbursal is exhaustive, lived in and as exhaustion, as
the solidarity of a shared atmosphere wherein an alternative
(meta)physics of the alternative is implied. Such implication is
manifest gesturally, in social life's refusal of real politics,
something Ashon T. Crawley might call mutually resuscitative,
(pre)occupied, blackpalestinian breath. **[Ferguson and Gaza are also
entangled---like settler coloniality and the state and like the violent
two-state solution (i.e., the United States and the State of Israel) in
which Ferguson and Gaza will have been dissolved---and we need to try to
understand the difference between the people who know that and the
people who don't. Puar knows, and shapes common knowledge of our common,
if neither proximate nor synchronized, aspiration.]{.underline}** In its
inveterate statelessness, blackpalestinian breath is both imposed
disability and elective affinity, against the grain of every deadly,
fetishistic modality of vitalism given in the state's serial
self-support and self-consultancy, which takes its most venal form in
martial intellectuality, a range of training protocols wherein
scholarship fulfills itself, unto its vanishing point, as a branch of
the armed forces. What are the implications for blackpalestinian breath
of the necessarily settler-colonial state's exercise of what Puar calls
the will "not to let die," which is a matter of military reason? **[Do
the logic and metaphysics of the individual life continually lubricate
the machine that exercises the right to kill in the will not to let die?
If genocide, in the end, is just this continual maiming, which moves in
the non-space between killing each and every one and the constantly
cultivated, measured, and tested inability to kill all, then how might
we offer, in practicing, a form of informal, enforming life that
continually refuses the very idea of a basic human unit and its always
already racialized embodiment? Such embodiment is a disability, a wound,
our shared flesh shares and so we have to ask if debilitative
individuation is fundamental to the logic of genocide because it exposes
the limits of genocide's implied metaphysics. Where attempts at mass
death strain against the limits of accounting, the imposition of the
body-in-individuation is this perpetual wounding and incarceration of
the mass--an ongoing maiming that obliterates sacrilege and sacrifice.
But what do we say about the structures of incompleteness that attend
and precede this maiming, which is not simply an imposition of
incompleteness but the enforcement of a certain incompleteness, one
given in the chalk-outlined conceptual figuration of the body itself
when it is reduced to stasis, which is, if you'll forgive me, its
natural state. It is necessary, then, to unexplain such vicious
culmination and the amputative diminishment it bears. The very idea of
Black Lives, or Palestinian Lives, those carceral sets of pluralized
singularities, bears the incapacitating capacity to be counted, a burden
that is not a matter of mattering but is, rather, the ghoulish
convergence of de-materialization and de-animation. Here, it is
important to note, by way of Puar, that this is as much a denial of
death as it is a reductively repetitive and representational death
sentence, which seeks to detach decay from decomposition and, thus, from
(re)generation. What's at stake is something paradoxical---like a local
anaesthesia that seeks to impose a general anaesthetic
effect.]{.underline}** Blackpalestinian breath is genocidally cut short
in the complex, structurally separable instantiation of Black and
Palestinian Lives, one by one. **[Meanwhile, the new, co-constituting
assemblage of Ferguson, Gaza that Puar critically celebrates allows and
requires us to ask what it would mean to recognize, but also to embrace
and enact, the exhaustion of the state solution. We give life to the
state solution when we breathe air into the dead language of lives and
bodies. Perhaps we can embrace and enact that exhaustion when we say
another naming, against the grain of nominalized individuation and the
state and stasis for which such naming inadvertently
settles.]{.underline}** This would be the enactment of a healthy
incompleteness arrayed against order and its terms, as Cedric Robinson
might say, where blackpalestinian study's interinannimation of ascent
and descent and assent and dissent---its improper complexities of
hostility and hospitality, its jurisgenerative harvest on unowned land,
its sounding ululative height in melismatic underground---works like an
organ without a body, as more + less than one.

#### US military aid is not neutral but instead is the condition of possibility for violence in Israel -- the aff is uniquely suited to interrupt the militarization of Palestine as it shatters the normative assumption of aid as a neutral project

**[Palestinian civil society has called for a military embargo on
Israel]{.underline}**. **[This appeal is not limited to the United
States; the United Kingdom has also been under scrutiny for trading arms
with Israel, including weapons that evidence confirms have been used in
human rights violations]{.underline}**: "In the six months prior to the
attack on Gaza in the summer of 2014, the UK government granted licenses
worth £6,968,865 for military-use exports and £25,155,581 for dual-use
equipment. **[The licensed items included combat aircraft components,
drone components, antiarmor ammunition and weapon night
sights]{.underline}**. Meanwhile, the UK's Watchkeeper surveillance
drone has been developed under a £1 billion joint venture contract
awarded by the Ministry of Defense to Thales UK and Israel's Elbit
Systems, allowing the UK military to benefit from technologies that have
been 'field tested' on the occupied Palestinians. (Wearning, 2015: 3)."
Even in the best-case scenario, the net effect of international aid to
Palestinians is questionable. **[Its value is greatly undermined by the
fact that Israel's military action has been subsidized by the United
States and others and these actions have been granted political immunity
by the international community]{.underline}**. **[Palestinian critics of
aid therefore maintain that Western donors are complicit in Israel's
violations of Palestinian rights, despite efforts by donor governments
to distinguish their political actions from their aid policy, suggesting
that aid policy is somehow "neutral."]{.underline}** Fragmentation and
Militarized Aid **[Israeli policies have fragmented the Palestinian
community into several different legal/institutional components, all of
which are in some way militarized]{.underline}**. Because of this
fragmentation, aid to Palestine is also politicized and militarized in
different ways. **[Aid policies and practices contribute directly to
this political fragmentation and social disintegration between the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Palestinians, who make up 20% of the population of
Israel, are essentially colonized in a state that officially designates
them as having fewer rights than the Jewish population]{.underline}**.
**[Western aid to Palestinian citizens of Israel, which is limited and
subject to Israeli restrictions, generally focuses on strengthening
Palestinian ability to claim their rights as minorities]{.underline}**.
**[This focus reinforces Palestinian citizens' ties to Israel while
simultaneously weakening their connections to the rest of the
Palestinian community in the Arab world]{.underline}**. **[By
entrenching Palestinians' identity in this way as a "minority" rather
than as an indigenous people, western aid to Palestinians strengthens
Israel's territorial claims. In this way, aid to Palestinian citizens of
Israel is politically and institutionally part of western support for
Israel's vision, regardless of what those same countries may say
rhetorically about their support for Palestinian rights in international
law]{.underline}**. The three million Palestinians in the West Bank also
experience politicized and militarized aid. But these mechanisms are
more complicated. The Oslo Accords (1993) and the Paris Protocol (1994)
established a hegemonic political and economic model within which all
"development" in the occupied Palestinian territory takes place.
Researchers Tartir and Wildeman have explored the neoliberal interests
that underpin the World Bank framework guiding Western aid policy toward
the occupied Palestinian territory. They note that World Bank
prescriptions "... do not take into account the history and human
reality of Palestinians struggling to survive for decades under a
violent military occupation" (2012: 1). Tartir and Wildeman also
maintain that the World Bank over-estimates the capacity of the
Palestinian Authority (PA) to engage in demanded reforms, given that the
PA lacks sovereignty. In the West Bank, aid policy has distinct
implementation plans according to three areas designated by the Oslo
Accords -- Area A (under Palestinian Authority control), Area B (under
joint IsraeliPalestinian control, and Area C (under Israeli control).
The greatest controversy is in Area C where Israel enforces (and most
donors comply with) an illegal planning regime that denies Palestinians
access to their own natural resources and to their right to development
(Diakonia, 2013). By being unable or unwilling to challenge Israeli
militarization in Area C, international donors are contributing to the
sustainability of the status quo. While discussion of the political
status of Jerusalem was postponed by the Oslo process, the practical
reality of Israeli annexation of Jerusalem and forced transfer of
Jerusalem's native Palestinian population has been largely ignored by
international aid policy. The virtual collapse of the Palestinian
economy in East Jerusalem renders the city essentially unlivable for
Palestinians (Arafeh, 2016). Effectiveness of both humanitarian aid
(e.g. to Palestinian families whose homes have been demolished by
Israel) and development aid, which is limited by Israel's explicit
Judaization policy, is totally undermined. Aid policies and
implementation in the Gaza Strip is another and different case. The
Israeli blockade, which is now ten years old, makes the Gaza Strip
nearly totally dependent on international aid. **[No materials or people
can enter or exit Israeli checkpoints without Israeli military
permission. The system of aid is increasingly controlled by Israel, not
the United Nations, thus adding aid to the arsenal of weapons through
which Israel can increase its power and control over Palestinians in the
Gaza Strip]{.underline}**. In fact, the lack of adequate reconstruction
after the 2008-9, 2012 and 2014 Israeli attacks is due to the
militarized and securitized nature of the aid and the context within
which it is delivered (or not). **[Notably, having this aid delivered in
a highly securitized context makes it easier for donors to cover their
failures using the excuse of "security."]{.underline}** Approximately
five million registered Palestinian refugees also receive aid through a
dedicated United Nations agency, the United Nations Relief and Works
Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA, 2016). According
to critics, UNRWA's ambiguous protection mandate has prompted debate
about the extent to which UNRWA protects Palestinian rights or weakens
their ability to claim their rights through other bodies and mechanisms
(Farrah, 2010). Bilateral Aid to the Palestinian Authority **[Military
assistance to Israel is not the only way that international actors
subsidize the Israeli occupation of Palestine]{.underline}**. European
donors, the United States and Canada provide significant bilateral
assistance to the Palestinian Authority. In a scathing critique, Tartir
says about 30% of international aid is directed to the \$1bn/ year
Palestinian security sector, which is not accountable to the Palestinian
people and is increasingly authoritarian. Since 2005, the United States
and the European Union have supported sector reform, but "...the central
tenet of this project has been the entrenchment of  security
collaboration between the PA and Israel," not the security of
Palestinians (Tartir, 2016). That the PA and Israel work together on
security means that a substantial amount of aid to the PA security
sector is as much for Israel as it is for Palestine. **[Aid also makes
it easier and cheaper for Israel to provide security for its
settlements - illegal under international law and in the eyes of the
world and the US. The aid thus compromises the security of Palestinians
by funding the interests of their occupier]{.underline}**.
\"Collaboration\" under occupation in reality means dominance of the
oppressor. Tartir also notes that both Amnesty International and Human
Rights Watch have documented the Palestinian Authority security forces\'
excessive use of force and noted PA limits on freedom of speech,
political participation and mobilisation (Tartir, 2016). **[So, on one
hand, there is Israeli occupation and colonization that receives
militarized aid. On the other, there is the Palestinian Authority, which
receives ODA and spends it in a highly limited space within a
securitized "development" process]{.underline}**. So, **[aid in the
Palestinian context is driven by a hegemonic security rationale,
designed to address Israeli security concerns, in ways that make
Palestinians increasingly insecure]{.underline}** (Tartir, 2015). **[The
power asymmetry between the colonized and colonizer translates into
benefits to the more powerful actor and therefore sustains an anti-peace
status]{.underline}**. Mandy **[Turner has suggested that the intention
of Western "peacebuilding" interventions includes counterinsurgency. In
other words, aid seeks to pacify Palestinian national liberation
aspirations in Israel's interest]{.underline}** (Turner, 2014).
**[Investigations into the militarization of aid highlight two main
questions: (1) What should be done when a liberation movement is forced
to transform itself into a subcontractor to the colonizer as a result of
this militarized aid? and (2) Is it possible that militarized aid can
result in authoritarian tendencies giving dominance to security
establishments and personnel at the expense of other
sectors]{.underline}** (e.g., health, education, manufacturing) and at
the expense of democracy? In the case of Palestine, aid has not only
failed to address the poverty, employment and empowerment gaps, but has
also help create new insecurity and illegitimacy. Aggression is a Crime
That Should Not Be Funded By Aid **[The use of aid to promote or support
aggression is not only inappropriate and
counter-productive]{.underline}**, but arguably illegal. The purpose of
our global governance system, i.e. the United Nations, is, first and
foremost, "to maintain international peace and security, and to that
end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and
removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of
aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by
peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and
international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or
situations which might lead to a breach of the peace" (Charter of the
United Nations, 1945: Chapter 1, Article 1.1) Three basic humanitarian
principles -- humanity, neutrality and impartiality-- are enshrined in
General Assembly resolution 46/182 (1991) and have been reaffirmed in
innumerable UN resolutions and declarations (OCHA, 2009: 4). **[While
many Palestinians and internationals consider Palestine an exception to
aid norms, the problem of militarized aid is widespread]{.underline}**.
The New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States says that 30% of Official
Development Assistance is spent in fragile and conflict-affected
contexts (IDPS, 2011:1). The European Parliament reported that in 2013
over-two thirds of the humanitarian assistance recorded by the OECD was
directed to long-lasting crises (European Parliament, 2016: 3). **[This
data raises significant questions about aid. Either international aid is
having no effect on the perpetuation of conflict]{.underline}** (and
failing to stem the increase in humanitarian need), **[or,
alternatively, international aid contributes to increasing
conflict]{.underline}**. The report of the UN Secretary General on the
World Humanitarian Summit takes a predictably diplomatic tone. However,
a careful reading reveals acknowledgement that lack of political will is
at the heart of aid ineffectiveness. It says: "...Addressing people's
humanitarian needs requires more than increasing levels of assistance.
It necessitates a far more decisive and deliberate effort to reduce
needs, anchored in political will and leadership to prevent and end
conflict." (UNGA, 2016: 1). **[There is ample evidence in literature and
practice of the relationship between aid and the perpetuation of
conflict. Palestine offers one of many examples of how aid violates the
principle of "Do No Harm" that is fundamental not only to the
credibility of aid, but also the post-World War II international
system]{.underline}**. Aid must not promote or enable aggression either
actively or passively. **[In Palestine, aid for ostensibly "purely good"
purposes such as food, health, education, and water and sanitation, is
implemented inside a complex aid regime that serves the expansionist
political interests of Israel and its allies among donor
countries]{.underline}**. **[A recent study by Aid Watch Palestine found
that 78% of aid to the occupied Palestinian territory ends up in the
Israeli economy]{.underline}** (Hever, 2016), **[thus subsidizing
between 18-30% of the costs of the occupation]{.underline}**. Tartir and
Wildeman also note that forced economic integration with Israel makes
the Palestinian economy vulnerable. **[Israel has often withheld
funds]{.underline}** (**[with American support]{.underline}**) **[as
punishment for Palestinian policies it dislikes]{.underline}**,
including Palestinian pursuit of internationally enshrined rights
through United Nations mechanisms (2012: 1.) In one blatant example,
international aid utilizing the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism, to which
the United Nations is a party, has been criticized as giving legitimacy
to the illegal Israeli blockade on the Gaza Strip (Murad, 2015/16) and
assisting Israel by giving international cover for Israel's promotion of
its own economic and military interests. Conclusion **[Aid to
Palestinians is militarized on at least four levels: 1. Military aid and
military trade with Israel has been normalized, despite proof that such
assistance is being used to violate Palestinian rights under
international law]{.underline}**; 2. The Oslo two-state framework,
within which Western aid is implemented, reflects the political and
military interests of the United States, Europe and the World Bank-led
neoliberal consensus, instead of democratically determined Palestinian
interests; 3. **[Development and humanitarian aid to Palestinians,
whether it is funneled through international or Palestinian Authority
institutions, is structured to protect Israel's colonial monopoly at the
expense of Palestinian security and self-determination]{.underline}**;
and 4. Humanitarian aid through civil society, both international and
Palestinian, is conditioned by anti-terrorism policies that exacerbate
internal conflict, including armed conflict, in violation of principles
of impartiality and neutrality. 5. **[Aid supporting Israel would not
inherently violate Palestinian rights if aid actors]{.underline}** (in
their political and aid roles) **[held Israel accountable for compliance
with international law. However, impunity granted Israel by
international actors has had the effect of empowering its aggressive
policies, resulting in what appears to be a shocking hypocrisy: donor
governments and aid actors allowing Israel to deny Palestinian rights
while providing aid to Palestinians in ways that ensures Israel's
continued dominance]{.underline}**. Reclaiming Aid for Human Rights:
Policy Recommendations **[The militarization of aid to Palestinians
invalidates the legitimacy of aid as a credible humanitarian or
developmental intervention]{.underline}**. For international aid to
reclaim its potential as a contributor to the realization of human
rights, it must be aligned with effective political accountability
mechanisms that pressure all parties to comply with international law
and respect human rights. **[The global civil society boycott,
divestment and sanctions (BDS) campaign has had a demonstrable impact on
Israel's ability to pursue unaccountable military
development]{.underline}** (Juma' and Mantovani, 2016). **[All concerned
parties should study the potential of strategic sanctions as a way to
pressure Israel to comply with international law. The most immediate and
obvious action is to demand for a total military embargo on Israel and
all parties until this has been achieved]{.underline}**. **[This
securitized and militarized aid has a dramatic impact on the everyday
life of Palestinian people and their quest for freedom and
self-determination]{.underline}**. Evidence suggests that this form of
aid is anti-developmental, especially in situations of foreign military
occupation. In the case of Palestine, it has limited rather than
enhanced the capacity of Palestinian people to claim their right to
self-determination. **[The long-term effect is increased instability and
the likelihood of further militarism and violence. Empowering
Palestinians means equipping them with the tools to resist Israeli
settler colonial rule and enhancing their capacities for solidarity,
resilience and steadfastness. International aid actors must recognize
and accept that development under military occupation and colonization
means first and foremost a process of confrontation to realize rights,
including the right to self-determination]{.underline}**.

#### Thus we demand that arms sales to Israel from the United States should end. Grassroots activism is the necessary starting point of politics in the face of the Israel problem -- specifically interventions on the level of military support are the breaking point to generate change -- bottom up approaches are the lynchpin of progress 

**Rodriguez 2013** (Timothy Rodriguez, former Peace Corps volunteer,

Israel-Palestine Conflict with Activism\", Transformative Studies
Institute, Journal of Social Justice, Vol 3, 2013,

mmv)

Non-violent **[activism can include many tactics. The
goal]{.underline}**, indeed the reason protest is protected and
considered essential in a democracy, **[is to foster an active citizenry
that can influence, if not formulate, policy]{.underline}**. Activism
has played a significant part in overcoming slavery and apartheid to
gaining civil rights, human rights, women\'s rights, and environmental
rights, amongst other great changes in history.

**[One tactic that\'s reminiscent of the anti-apartheid movement is
called Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS).]{.underline}** This has
had some effect with the Israel-Palestine conflict, but not to the
extent of influencing policy. Part of the reason might be the lack of a
clear target and goal - a reoccurring argument among activists today.
One line of thinking argues that BDS should target any Israeli
institution indefinitely or until a solution is reached, while the other
side argues for specific BDS campaigns targeting those institutions
directly involved in the occupation of Palestinian land until arriving
at the two-state international consensus. As regards conflict
resolution, the latter of the two options seems to have the best
possibility for success using BDS as a tactic since it offers a clear
and feasible goal. The one state solution, or bi-national state, may be
the most moral and make the most sense, but has no acceptance on the
international level or among Palestinians and Israelis. The only way to
get from the current conflict to a bi-national state would be ceasing
the current hostilities through the acceptance of the two-state
international consensus and then organize a reconciliation process aimed
at integration. For the reasons of history, power interests, and global
affairs, this could prove to be a long and difficult process in and of
itself.

The other reason for limited success using BDS as a tactic is that while
there is some headway made on boycott and divestment, there isn\'t much
progress on sanctions. **[In a military occupation, sanctioning arms
sales and military aid, as was done with South Africa, is an important
piece to BDS in having an effect on policy]{.underline}**.
**[Strikingly, the U.S. and other nations are at the point of
sanctioning humanitarian aid and allowing a blockade on Palestinians,
but will not sanction aid to the Israeli military]{.underline}**.
**[This would be similar to sanctioning black South Africans while
funneling aid to the white apartheid regime]{.underline}** - similar to
what the U.S. and Europe did, in fact. **[Until sanctions can be
targeted against the Israeli military for their occupation of
Palestinian land, acquisition of territory, and subsequent violence - a
task that will be far more difficult than in the South African case if
only because Israel is far more important to U.S. strategic
interests]{.underline}** - **[BDS as a tactic will continue to have
limited effect]{.underline}**.

A second tactic used with nonviolent activism is direct action. **[There
are many forms of direct action, which have recently culminated in the
Gaza Freedom March, international peace envoys. Freedom Flotillas and
Flytillas, and the Arab Spring and Occupy Movement]{.underline}**.

In 2009, on the one year anniversary of Israel\'s military invasion into
Gaza that killed about 1,400 Palestinians, 1 traveled with the Gaza
Freedom March (GFM) to Egypt in order to challenge the blockade on Gaza
through the Ralah Crossing. **[The blockade is one of those issues, like
Israel\'s wall, of a conflict inside of the conflict. On the basis of
international law, and spelled out by leading human rights organizations
and the United Nations, the blockade on Gaza amounts to collective
punishment against a civilian population, which, not surprisingly, is
outlawed under the Fourth Geneva Convention]{.underline}**.

Any reasonable resolution to the conflict would be impossible with a
blockade on Gaza that prevented basic humanitarian supplies, and
materials for post-war reconstruction and independent development from
entering, while completely separating Gaza from the West Bank and the
rest of the world - amounting to what the U.N. called \"a protracted
human dignity crisis.\" (United Nations Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs, 2009) **[Therefore, the Gaza Freedom March, peace
envoys, flotillas, and \"flytillas\" were a form of non-violent direct
action by international civil society to apply pressure to those
responsible for the blockade and put the issue front and center for the
international community to enforce international law]{.underline}**.
**[The forms of direct action have had varied success, but, if nothing
else, were able to force states to react, shift debate and increase
public pressure against the blockade]{.underline}**.

**[Unquestionably, the most dramatic direct action has been the Arab
Spring and Occupy Movement, which have not specifically focused on the
Israel-Palestine conflict, but could potentially have far-reaching
effects on the region and, if organized enough, provide a platform for
the public to apply pressure on states to accept the international
consensus]{.underline}**. **[Most of these movements have been beat back
by force, but the threat of mass action is regularly on the minds of
governments around the world today. This in and of itself has an impact
on policy]{.underline}**.

One of the first issues to be brought up with the overthrow of Mubarak
was the opening of Egypt\'s border with Gaza. **[Egyptian public opinion
remains extremely against the blockade and Israeli military occupation,
but, after some early gains following the initial uprising, the border
quickly re-closed as the military took control and suppressed
protesters]{.underline}**. **[It was fairly clear when I was in Egypt in
February 2011 that the military, backed with \$1.3 billion of aid a year
from the United States, would attempt to carry on Mubarak\'s support for
the blockade as they heeded to Israel\'s request to station troops in
the Sinai to close the border should they take power]{.underline}**. On
the other hand, Egypt has played a major role in building stronger
relations between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, and, crucially,
negotiating a multilateral truce following Israel\'s 2012 bombing of
Gaza. **[Add this to the deteriorating relations between Israel and
Turkey, a powerful actor in the region and United States ally, the
possible fall of Bashar Al-Assad in Syria, and schisms over using force
in Iran while failing to convince the international community of Iranian
nuclear weapons, Israel could lose its unilateral power in future
negotiations. International public opinion and Israel\'s increasing
arrogance has become Israel\'s largest enemy]{.underline}**.

In a new book entitled Knowing Too Much, Norman Finkelstein argues that
the American Jewish population has begun turning against much of
Israel\'s policies in the Occupied Territories. Detailing changes in
public opinion, and the proposals from negotiators revealed in the
Palestine Papers, there is, he argues, increasing acceptance for a
reasonable resolution to the conflict on the basis of international law.
This shift, if organized, could make a significant impact on United
States policy in the region. Israel\'s own actions, as the 2012 bombing
of Gaza and subsequent defeat illustrates, Israel\'s own actions are
being turned against itself.

The general framework for resolving the Israel-Palestine conflict is
fairly straightforward when principles of international law are
accepted. **[Since progress is blocked by politically powerful nations,
it is up to civil society, through non-violent activism, pressure at the
United Nations, and reasonable negotiations]{.underline}** to bring
about the international two-state consensus. **[If we (particularly the
U.S. and Israel) wish to resolve the conflict, steps are available to
bring an end to the \"final status\" issues and provide an atmosphere
for a longer sustainable peace through acceptance of the international
consensus]{.underline}**. If not, we will continue to hold \"peace
talks\" with \"wrecking tactics\" and not take a principled stance on
the acquisition of Palestinian land, which can pave the way for further
violence in the region and abroad with the continuation of the conflict.

As has happened so often in history, **[the hope for a just resolution
to the conflict lies in the hands of activists, protesters, and
non-violent opposition to crimes being perpetrated. If we succeed, it
will be a grand achievement in overcoming a form of settler
colonialism]{.underline}** and potentially have a civilizing effect in
the world. **[If we fail, we guarantee further bloodshed, suffering, and
an unstable region in the ongoing conflict. Considering the protests
around the world today and continued international shift against Israeli
state policy we could indeed, if properly organized, achieve a peaceful
settlement of the Israel-Palestine conflict once and for
all]{.underline}**.

**[The call for the boycott of Israeli academic
institutions]{.underline}**, then, does not come to the MLA from an
outside, because **[the distinction between the inside and outside
reiterates an inheritance---what de Man famously called "a binary
polarity of classical banality in the history of metaphysics"---that is
reproduced through the self-understanding]{.underline}** of the MLA,
**[as this understanding is reflected in the antiboycott
vote]{.underline}**.18 The call for boycott teaches us to understand the
MLA's **[resistance to boycott]{.underline}**---all at once, (1) **[its
resistance to the foundational illegibility, and the ruptured and split
foundation]{.underline}** (for example, inside/outside), **[of what we
continue to call "literature";]{.underline}** (2) **[its resistance to
any conceptualization of the historical and social forms that give place
to and sustain its practices of interpretation---including slavery,
genocide, and settler colonialism---and the ongoing pertinence of those
forms in and for acts of reading]{.underline}**; and (3) **[its
resistance to its approaching in a critical manner, nothing less than
its thinking, its own relation to, and its intensification of, the
perpetuation of forms of social injustice and asymmetrically apportioned
violence, of ways of living and dying, within and beyond
America]{.underline}**---as if America had an outside. The MLA
**[resists boycott, then, and it becomes itself through that resistance;
the MLA, through its antiboycott vote, privileges a legibility of
objects and an identitarian understanding of form, and, in doing so, it
does not exclude literary pedagogical reflection because it affirms it,
as it absorbs the unsettled motion of language to which that reflection
responds]{.underline}**, in relation to a Bildung-centricity that we
must, each of us, allow to be left behind. It is perhaps in teaching us
that this resistance is foundational for the MLA, that this resistance
is the foundation of the MLA, that **[BDS---the call and movement for
boycott, divestment, and sanctions against the Israeli
state]{.underline}**, initiated by Palestinian civil society on July 9,
2005, and to which the call for the boycott of Israeli academic
institutions responds---**[offers us a lesson, and a gift, that is
pedagogical and literary]{.underline}**.19 It---**[BDS---teaches us that
a singular consequence of the MLA's antiboycott vote is that the MLA
must end, which is to say that,]{.underline}** (1) if, in its present
form, the MLA affirms a white supremacist, Bildung-centric
inheritance---an inheritance that governs the teaching and reading of
literature until today, and that articulates and transmutes the modern,
**[Western traditions of aesthetics and pedagogy---then this
institution, however it presents itself, is something that each of us
must oppose]{.underline}**; and (2) if the MLA ceases to affirm this
inheritance---this organization of fields, this understanding of
language, this affirmation of the legibility of objects, and this
privileging of "I" as a literary, linguistic, and social form---then
this institution will no longer be the MLA, because it will have become,
without any assurance of what is to come, something entirely other.
**[We---whoever, anyone who reads or writes or speaks, within or between
whichever languages---must welcome BDS, then, as a series of
ethical-political claims and as an affirmation of solidarity with the
Palestinian people and the forms of popular struggle they continue to
announce, but also, and equally, as a provocation and an
insistence---perhaps as nothing but an accentuation that points beyond
the forms of understanding, of being, and of being with others that the
MLA has affirmed]{.underline}**. At stake is a question of reading,
where **[reading is a practice that disaffirms the coherency, internal
and external, of "I," where objects, this or that one, persist in
occasioning "a quite particular refusal to adjust,"]{.underline}**20
**[a refusal to take on this or that coherency of form, and where this
refusal schools is in a way or mode or practice of reading that would no
longer privilege "the presentness of the object in all of its internal
difference, in all of its interiority and internal
space,"]{.underline}**21 **[but that would be only a sort of
listening---one that, as Fred Moten has written, "goes bone deep, into
the sunken art of bones," where listening "is something other than
itself]{.underline}**."22

#### The aff is a jurisgenerative act which forwards a new conceptualization of politics -- one that refuses the call of the state and instead is a political imagination beyond the bounds of sovereignty

IN his celebrated essay \"Nomos and Narrative;\' **[legal scholar Robert
Cover describes it as \"remarkable that in myth and history the origin
of and justification for a court is rarely understood to be the need for
law]{.underline}**. Rather, **[it is understood to be the need to
suppress law, to choose between two or more laws, to impose upon laws a
hierarchy. It is the multiplicity of laws, the fecundity of the
jurisgenerative principle, that creates the problem to which the court
and the state are the solution]{.underline}**:\'1 Though Cover is
ambivalent regarding the abolition of this solution, which he
understands to be violent, of necessity, **[his advocacy of a certain
resistance to the very apparatuses whose necessity he denaturalizes
makes it possible for us to ask some questions that the state and the
understanding find not only inappropriate but also
inappropriable]{.underline}**. **[What if the imagination is not lawless
but lawful? What if it is, in fact, so full of laws that, moreover, are
in such fugitive excess of themselves that the imagination, of
necessity, is constantly, fugitively in excess of itself as
well?]{.underline}** Will law have then been manifest paralegally,
criminally, fugitively, as a kind of ongoing antisystemic break or
breaking; as sociality\'s disruptive avoidance of mere civility which
takes form in and as a contemporaneity of different times and the
inhabitation of multiple, possible worlds and personalities? **[In
response to this anoriginal priority of the differential set, the courts
and the state]{.underline}** (as well as critics of every stripe)
**[will have insisted upon the necessity of policing such
collaboration]{.underline}**. Meanwhile, **[relations between worlds
will have been given in and as a principle of
non-exclusion]{.underline}**. **[The line of questioning that Cover
requires and enables brings the jurisgenerative principle to bear on a
burden that it must bear: the narrative that begins with the
criminalization of that principle]{.underline}**. **[In studying the
criminalization of an original criminality (which Western civilization
and its critique requires us to understand as the epidermalization of
the alternative, but which we\'ll come more rigorously and precisely to
imagine as the animaterialization of the fantastic in chromatic
saturation) one recognizes that the jurisgenerative principle is a
runaway]{.underline}**. Gone underground, it remains, nevertheless, our
own anarchic ground. **[Cover reveals the constituted indispensability
of the legal system as an institutional analog of the understanding
designed to curtail the lawless freedom with which laws are generated
and subsequently argues for the duty to resist legal system, even if
from within it, in its materialization in and as the
state.]{.underline}** In the concluding paragraph of his unfinished
final article \"The Bonds of Constitutional Interpretation: Of the Word,
the Deed, and the Role;\' he argues that \"**[in law to be an
interpreter is to be a force, an actor who creates effects even through
or in the face of violence. To stop short of suffering or imposing
violence is to give law up to those who are willing to so act. The state
is organized to overcome scruple and fear. Its officials will so act.
All others are merely petitioners if they will not fight
back]{.underline}**:\'2 But insofar as some of us cling to Samuel
Beckett\'s notion that \"**[the thing to avoid \... is the spirit of
system;\' we are left to wonder how else and where else the resistance
of the jurisgenerative multitude is constituted]{.underline}**. 3
Moreover, we are required to consider an interarticulate relationship
between flight and fight that American jurisprudence can hardly fathom.
That man was not meant to run away is, for Oliver Wendell Holmes,
sufficient argument for a combat whose true outcome will have become,
finally, eugenic rather than abolitionist. **[To assert a duty to
resist, enacted in and by way of the vast range of principled fugitivity
as opposed to the absence of a duty to retreat, is a reading against the
grain of Holmes\'s interpretive insistence on honor, on a certain
manhood severely husbanding generativity, a patrimonial heritage
manifest as good breeding and as legal violence against bad breeding,
given in the prolific but inferior productivity of the unintelligent,
whether black or (merely optically) white]{.underline}**. 4 **[Reading
Cover]{.underline}**, always against the backdrop of a certain
multiply-lined, multi-matrilinear music, **[requires re-generalizing
fighting back, recalibrating it as inaugurative, improvisational,
radical interpretation-a fundamental and anticipatory disruption of the
standard whose cut origin and extended destination are way
outside]{.underline}**. **[This implies a kind of open access to
interpretation that in turn implies the failure of state-sanctioned
institutions of interpretation insofar as they could never survive such
openness]{.underline}**. One must still consider interpretations
relation to force, as Cover understands it, but also by way of a massive
discourse of force in which, **[on the one hand, the state monolith is
pitted against the so much more than single speaker and, on the other
hand, in which the state, as a kind of degraded representation of
commonness, is submitted to an illegitimate and disruptive
univocality]{.underline}**. Meanwhile, criminality, militancy,
improvisatory literacy, and flight collaborate in jurisgenerative
assertion, ordinary transportation, corrosive, caressive (non)violence
directed toward the force of state interpretation and its institutional
and philosophical scaffolding. **[It\'s a refusal in interpretation of
interpretation\'s reparative and representational imperatives, the
mystical and metaphysical foundations of its logics of accountability
and abstract equivalence, by the ones who are refused the right to
interpret at the militarized junction of politics and taste, where
things enter into an objecthood already compromised by the drama of
subjection]{.underline}**. In the end, **[state interpretation-or
whatever we would call the exclusionary protocols of whatever
interpretive community-tries to usurp the general, generative role of
study, which is an open admissions kind of thing]{.underline}**.

#### Our interruption in the smooth functioning of politics-as-usual takes back power from the State and refuses the call of sovereignty -- instead beginning our demand at the local level opens up possibilities for existence and engages in the most true form of politics which spill up and out -- anything else recreates violent modes of engagement

2\. MICHAEL BROWN (A WYNTER'S TALE) How can we survive genocide? We can
only address this question by studying how we have survived genocide. In
the interest of imagining what exists there is an image of Michael Brown
we must refuse in favor of another image we don't have. One is a lie,
the other unavailable. **[If we refuse to show the image of a lonely
body, of the outline of the space that body simultaneously took and
left, we do so in order to imagine jurisgenerative black social life
walking down the middle of the street]{.underline}**---for a minute, but
only for a minute, **[unpoliced, another city gathers,
dancing.]{.underline}** We know it's there, and here, and real; we know
what we can't have happens all the time. When my brother fell/ I picked
up his weapons./ I didn't question/ whether I could aim or be as precise
as he. /A needle and thread/ were not among/ his things/ I found. Essex
Hemphill, "When My Brother Fell" When we walk down the street/ We don't
care who we see or who we meet/ Don't need to run, don't need to hide/
'cause we got something burning inside/ we've got love power/ it's the
greatest power of them all/ we've got love power/ and together we can't
fall. Luther Vandross, "Power of Love/Love Power" At times, this land
will shake your understanding/ of the world/ and confusion will eat away
at your sense/ of humanity/ but at least you will feel normal. Vernon Ah
Kee, from Whitefellanormal **[These passages bear an analytic of the
lost and found, of fallenness and ascension, that comes burning to mind
in and as the name of Michael Brown. First, that there is a social
erotics of the lost and found in fallenness' refusal of
standing.]{.underline}** We fall so we can fall again, which is what
ascension really means to us. **[To fall is to lose one's place, to lose
the place that makes one, to relinquish the locus of being, which is to
say of being single. This radical homelessness--- its kinetic
indigeneity, its irreducible queerness---is the essence of
blackness.]{.underline}** This refusal to take place is given in what it
is to occur. **[Michael Brown is the latest name of the ongoing event of
resistance to, and resistance before, socioecological disaster.
Modernity's constitution in the trans-Atlantic slave trade, settler
colonialism and capital's emergence in and with the state, is The
Socioecological Disaster.]{.underline}** Michael Brown gives us occasion
once again to consider what it is to endure the disaster, to survive
(in) genocide, to navigate unmappable differences as a range of
localities that, in the end---either all the way to the end or as our
ongoing refusal of beginnings and ends---will always refuse to have been
taken. **[The fall is anacatastrophic refusal of the case and,
therefore, of the world, which is the earth's capture insofar as it was
always a picture frozen and extracted from imaginal movement. At stake
is the power of love, which is given, in walking down the street, as
defiance to the (racial capitalist, settler colonial) state and its
seizures, especially its seizure of the capacity to make (and break)
law. Against the grain of the state's monopolization of ceremony,
ceremonies are small and profligate; if they weren't everywhere and all
the time we'd be dead.]{.underline}** The ruins, which are small
rituals, aren't absent but surreptitious, a range of songful scarring,
when people give a sign, shake a hand. But **[what if together we can
fall, because we're fallen, because we need to fall again, to continue
in our common fallenness, remembering that falling is in apposition to
rising, their combination given in lingering, as the giving of pause,
recess, vestibular remain, custodial remand, hold, holding in the
interest of rub, dap's reflex and reflection of maternal touch, a
maternal ecology of laid hands, of being handled, handed, handed down,
nurture's supernatural dispersion]{.underline}**. Hemphill emphatically
announces the sociality that Luther shelters. Fallen, risen, mo(u)rnful
survival. When black men die it's usually because we love each other,
whether we run, or fight or surrender. Consider Michael Brown's
generative occurrence and recurrence as refusal of the case, as refusal
of standing. You can do this but only if you wish to insert yourself,
and now I must abuse a phrase of Ah Kee's, into black worldlessness.9
**[Our homelessness. Our selflessness. None of which are or can be ours.
The state can't live with us and it can't live without us. Its violence
is a reaction to that condition. The state is nothing other than a war
against its own condition.]{.underline}** **[The state is at war against
its own (re)sources, in violent reaction to its own condition of
im/possibility, which is living itself, which is the earth itself, which
blackness doesn't so much stand in for as name, as a name among others
that is not just another name among others]{.underline}**. That we
survive is beauty and testament; it is neither to be dismissed nor
overlooked nor devalued by or within whatever ascription of value; that
we survive is invaluable. It is, at the same time, insufficient. **[We
have to recognize that a state---the racial capitalist/settler colonial
state---of war has long existed. Its brutalities and militarizations,
its regulative mundanities, are continually updated and revised, but
they are not new. If anything, we need to think more strategically about
our own innovations, recognizing that the state of war is a reactive
state, a machine for regulating and capitalizing upon our innovations
in/for survival. This is why what's most disturbing about Michael
Brown]{.underline}** (aka Eric Garner, aka Renisha McBride, aka Trayvon
Martin, aka Eleanor Bumpurs, aka Emmitt Till, **[aka an endless streams
of names and absent names]{.underline}**) **[is our reaction to him, our
misunderstanding of him, and the sources of that misunderstanding that
manifest and reify a desire for standing, for stasis, within the state
war machine which, contrary to popular belief, doesn't confer
citizenship upon its subjects at birth but, rather, at death, which is
the proper name for entrance into its properly political
confines]{.underline}**. The prosecution of Michael Brown, which is the
proper technical name for the grand jury investigation of Darren Wilson,
the drone, is what our day in court looks like and always has. **[The
prone, exposed, unburied body---the body that is given, in death, its
status as body precisely through and by way of the withholding of
fleshly ceremony---is what political standing looks like]{.underline}**.
That's the form it takes and keeps. This is a Sophoclean formulation.
**[The law of the state is what Ida B. Wells rightly calls lynch law.
And we extend it in our appeals to it. We need to stop worrying so much
about how it kills, regulates and accumulates us and worry more about
how we kill, deregulate and disperse it. We have to love and revere our
survival, which is (in) our resistance]{.underline}**. **[We have to
love our refusal of what has been refused]{.underline}**. But insofar as
this refusal2 has begun to stand, insofar as it has begun to seek
standing, it stands in need of renewal, now, even as the sources and
conditions of that renewal become more and more obscure, more and more
entangled with the regulatory apparatuses that are deployed in order to
suppress them. **[At moments like this we have to tell the truth with a
kind of viciousness and, even, a kind of cruelty. Black lives don't
matter, which is an empirical statement not only about black lives in
this state of war but also about lives. This is to say that lives don't
matter; nor should they. It's the metaphysics of the individual life in
all its immateriality that's got us in this situation in the first
place]{.underline}**. Michael Brown lived and moved within a deep and
evolving understanding of this: if i leave this earth today atleast
youll know i care about others more then i cared about my damn
self."\... But we have to consider how, and what it means that, his
testament is transformed into an expression of mourning and outrage such
as this upon the non-occasion of the non-indictment: Go on call me
\"demon\" but I WILL love my damn self. We suffer with but also through
this expression of our suffering. **[For this expression of our
disavowal of the demonic---however brutally the police and/or the polis,
in their soullessness, ascribe it to or inscribe it upon us---is
erstwhile respectability's voluntary laying down of arms, its elective
demobilization of jurisgenerative force]{.underline}**. Meanwhile,
**[Michael Brown is like another fall and rise through man---come and
gone, as irruption and rupture, to remind us not that black lives matter
but that black life matters; that the absolute and undeniable blackness
of life matters; that this is not a judgment of value but a description
of a field of activity]{.underline}**. The innovation of our survival is
given in embrace of this daimonic, richly internally differentiated
choreography, its lumpen improvisation of contact, which is obscured
when class struggle in black studies threatens to suppress black study
as class struggle. 22 How much has black studies, as a bourgeois
institutionalization of black study, determined the way we understand
and fight the state of war within which we try to live? How has it
determined how we understand the complex non-singularity that we know
now as Michael Brown? It would be wrong to say that Michael Brown has
become, in death, more than himself. **[He already was that, as he said
himself, in echo of so much more than himself. He was already more than
that in being less than that, in being the least of these. To reduce
Michael Brown to a cypher for our unfulfilled desire to be more than
that, for our serially unachieved and constitutionally unachievable
citizenship, is to do a kind of counter-revolutionary violence; it is to
partake in the ghoulish, vampiric consumption of his body, of the body
that became his, though it did not become him, in death, in the
reductive stasis to which his flesh was subjected]{.underline}**.
Michael Brown's flesh is our flesh; he is flesh of our flesh of
flames.10 **[On August 9, like every day, like any other day, black
life, in its irreducible sociality, having consented not to be single,
got caught walking--- with jurisgenerative fecundity---down the middle
of the street. Michael Brown and his boys: black life breaking and
making law, against and underneath the state, surrounding it. They had
foregone the melancholic appeal, to which we now reduce them, for
citizenship, and subjectivity, and humanness]{.underline}**. That they
had done so is the source of Darren Wilson's genocidal
instrumentalization in the state's defense. **[They were in a state of
war and they knew it. Moreover, they were warriors in insurgent, if
imperfect, beauty. What's left for us to consider is the difference
between the way of Michael Brown's dance, his fall and rise, his ongoing
demon/stration and the well-meaning protests of mere petitioners,
fruitlessly seeking energy in the pitiful, minimal, temporary shutdown
of this or that freeway, as if mere occupation were something other than
retrenchment (in reverse) of the demand for recognition that actually
constitutes business as usual. Rather than dissipate our preoccupation
with how we live and breathe, we need to defend our ways in our
persistent practice of them. It's not about taking the streets; it's
about how, and about what, we take to the streets]{.underline}**.
**[What would it be and what would it mean for us jurisgeneratively to
take to the streets, to live in the streets, to gather together another
city right here, right now]{.underline}**? Meanwhile, **[against the
dead citizenship that was imposed upon him, the body the state tried to
make him be, and in lieu of the images we refuse and can't have, here is
an image of our imagination]{.underline}**. **[This is Michael Brown,
his descent, his ascension, his ceremony, his flesh, his animation in
and of the maternal ecology---Michael Brown's innovation, as contact, in
improvisation. Contact improvisation is how we survive
genocide]{.underline}**.

### US Funding Israel

#### Israel is currently the largest recipient of foreign military sales by the United States---locked in and increasing. 

**Sharp 18** (Jeremy, Specialist in Middle East Affairs at the

<https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf>, p. ii) NIJ

Summary This report provides an overview of U.S. foreign assistance to
Israel. It includes a review of past aid programs, data on annual
assistance, and analysis of current issues. For general information on
Israel, see CRS Report RL33476, Israel: Background and U.S. Relations,
by Jim Zanotti. **[Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of U.S.
foreign assistance since World War II.]{.underline}** To date, **[the
United States has provided Israel \$134.7 billion]{.underline}**
(current, or noninflation-adjusted, dollars) **[in bilateral assistance
and missile defense funding. Almost all U.S. bilateral aid to Israel is
in the form of military assistance]{.underline}**, although in the past
Israel also received significant economic assistance. At a signing
ceremony at the State Department **[on September 14, 2016,
representatives of the U.S. and Israeli governments signed a new 10-year
Memorandum of Understanding]{.underline}** (MOU) **[on military
aid]{.underline}** covering FY2019 to FY2028. **[Under the terms of the
MOU, the United States pledges to provide \$38 billion in military
aid]{.underline}** (\$33 billion in Foreign Military Financing grants
plus \$5 billion in missile defense appropriations) **[to Israel. This
MOU replaces a previous \$30 billion 10-year agreement, which runs
through FY2018. Israel is the first international operator of the F-35
Joint Strike Fighter, the Department of Defense's fifth-generation
stealth aircraft, considered to be the most technologically advanced
fighter jet ever made.]{.underline}** To date, **[Israel has purchased
50 F-35s in three separate contracts.]{.underline}** P.L. 115-141,
**[the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act, provides the following
for Israel:]{.underline}**  **[\$3.1 billion in Foreign Military
Financing]{.underline}**, of which \$815.3 million is for offshore
procurement;  **[\$705.8 million for joint U.S.-Israeli missile defense
projects]{.underline}**, including \$92 million for Iron Dome, \$221.5
million for David\'s Sling, \$310 million for Arrow 3, and \$82.3
million for Arrow 2;  **[\$47.5 million for the U.S.-Israeli
anti-tunnel cooperation program]{.underline}**;  **[\$7.5 million in
Migration and Refugee Assistance;]{.underline}**  **[\$4 million for
the establishment of a U.S.-Israel Center of Excellence in energy and
water technologies;]{.underline}**  **[\$2 million for the Israel-U.S.
Binational Research & Development Foundation (BIRD) Energy program;
and]{.underline}**  **[The reauthorization of War Reserves Stock
Allies-Israel (WRSA-I) program through fiscal year 2019. For FY2019, the
Trump Administration is requesting \$3.3 billion in Foreign Military
Financing for Israel]{.underline}** and \$500 million in missile defense
aid to mark the first year of the new MOU. The Administration also is
seeking \$5.5 million in Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) funding
for humanitarian migrants to Israel.

#### This funding supports the settler colonial genocide of Palestinians in the Gaza strip.

**[When Washington provides military aid to Israel, the United States is
complicit in war crimes and the systematic destruction of the
Palestinian people.]{.underline}** The United States officially signed
the "single largest pledge of bilateral military assistance in U.S.
history," according to the State department. **[The U.S. will provide
Israel with an unprecedented \$38 billion military aid package over a
10-year period]{.underline}**, which includes \$5 billion in missile
defense. **[The strengthening of the American and Israeli war industries
and the maintenance of the current balance of power of the Middle East
is expected, but it is still morally reprehensible.]{.underline}** Seven
Billion Dollar Shortfall The \$38 billion military aid is a shortfall
from the \$45 billion package Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu
originally asked for. The current military aid also establishes certain
limitations --- including the agreement that Israel cannot ask the U.S.
for more money during the 10-year period. According to Haaretz,
**[Israel "will have to spend all its American aid money on purchases
from U.S. military industries"]{.underline}** --- a change from when
Israel previously allowed to use its American aid money on its own
military industries. According to Stephen R. Shalom, a professor at
William Paterson University, **[the new military aid will support
Israel's war crimes --- including the systematic destruction of the Gaza
Strip and the settler-colonization of the West Bank.]{.underline}**
**[Israel's conduct is morally unacceptable and a violation of
international law.]{.underline}** The American military support of
Israel is also a breach of the Leahy Law which states, "No assistance
shall be furnished... to any unit of the security forces of a foreign
country if the Secretary of State has credible information that such
unit has committed a gross violation of human rights." Reporter Ryan
McNamara wrote in Jacobin Magazine on how **["in just one 24-hour period
during negotiations over the new aid package, Israel bombed Gaza and
announced new settlements in the West Bank city of Hebron. How can the
Palestinians --- who have no air force, command and control, missile
defense and tanks --- defend themselves from one of the world's most
advanced military?]{.underline}** Over 2,000 Dead As investigative
journalist Max Blumenthal reported two years ago **[during Operation
Protective Edge, Israel's 51-day bombing campaign in the Gaza Strip left
over 2,000 Palestinians dead --- including over 500 children. Like all
wars, women and children tend to be the victims who suffer the most.
When Israel deliberately turns off its electricity to hundreds of
thousands of Palestinians in the middle of winter "as punishment for
joining the \[International Criminal Court\]" and restricts access to
drinking water, they are harming women and children. When Israel
calculates a "calorie count" to starve Palestinians during a blockade,
this has little to do with Hamas.]{.underline}** As Shalom points out,
**["After all, you don't need fifth-generation stealth technology to
blow up civilian houses in the Gaza Strip" --- the most densely
populated area in the world. It is time for the United States to drop
its military support for Israel now.]{.underline}** **[This is a
relationship strictly defined by American hegemonic and geopolitical
interests --- and it is literally killing people. The only way this will
become possible is if the American people stands in solidarity with
Palestinians by pressuring the government to stop its endorsement of
Israel's actions. Israel has already received \$125 billion in aid from
the United States since World War II.]{.underline}** As Christians, we
say no more to war and violence.

#### The US provides \$3.8 billion to Israel in military aid every year -- this is more than the US gives to the rest of the world combined.

## Harms

### Occupation Bad -- Genocide

#### Israeli occupation has unequivocally resulted in genocide and multiple human rights violations -- multiple experts confirm. 

**CCR 16** (Center for Constitutional Rights "The Genocide of the
Palestinian People: An International Law and Human Rights Perspective"
<https://ccrjustice.org/genocide-palestinian-people-international-law-and-human-rights-perspective>)
NIJ

Long-Term Military Occupation of Palestinian People When the
international community ratified legal rules that would regulate the
actions of occupying powers while also protecting the rights of occupied
peoples and nations/states, it was understood that military occupation
would be a short-lived necessity attendant to armed conflict, and that
occupying forces would be withdrawn at the end of the conflict.\[19\]
**[Israel's prolonged belligerent occupation of the West Bank, including
East Jerusalem, and Gaza for 50 years far exceeds the kind of occupation
that animated the creation of legal rules of occupation contained in
international law. Given the seemingly permanent nature of the Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza,]{.underline}** some **[human
rights experts]{.underline}**, including Israeli historian Ilan Pappé,
**[have warned of an "incremental genocide" of Palestinians and the
ultimate destruction of Palestinians as a national
group.]{.underline}**\[20\] **[This "incremental genocide" through the
policies and practices that have both sustained and served as the
hallmarks of Israel's occupation is accomplished, they argue, by a
normalization of the Israeli annexation of Palestinian territory and the
exile or absorption of the national group of people who identify as
Palestinian. International law is clear that an occupying power may not
annex the people or territory it occupies.]{.underline}**\[21\] **[The
late human rights lawyer and Center for Constitutional Rights Board
President Michael Ratner also charged Israel with committing
"incremental genocide" against the Palestinian people: "There's no doubt
again here this is 'incremental genocide,']{.underline}** as Ilan Pappé
says. **[It's been going on for a long time, the killings, the
incredibly awful conditions of life, the expulsions that have gone on
from Lydda in 1947 and '48, when 700 or more villages in Palestine were
destroyed, and in the expulsions that continued from that time until
today. It's correct and important to label it for what it
is."]{.underline}**\[22\] He argued further, **["I want to emphasize
today \[that\] these killings are part of a broader set of inhuman acts
by Israel constituting international crimes, carried out by Israel over
many years, going back to at least 1947 and 1948. They include crimes
that aren't talked about that much in the media or the press, the crimes
of genocide, crimes against humanity, and apartheid.]{.underline}**
These crimes can be prosecuted in the International Criminal Court and
are defined there."\[23\] **[The Russell Tribunal on Palestine, a
nongovernmental "people's body" made up of prominent international human
rights experts and advocates,]{.underline}** convened between November
2010 and September 2014 to investigate the question of human rights
violations in the context of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank,
including East Jerusalem, and Gaza.\[24\] It took testimony and
deliberated specifically on the question of whether Israel may have
committed genocide in relation to the Palestinian people. The jury
**[concluded that some]{.underline}** **[Israeli citizens and leaders
may have been guilty in several instances of the separate crime of
incitement to genocide]{.underline}**, which is specified in Article
3(c) of the Genocide Convention. **["The cumulative effect of the
long-standing regime of collective punishment in Gaza appears to inflict
conditions of life calculated to bring about the incremental destruction
of the Palestinians as a group in Gaza. The Tribunal emphasises the
potential for a regime of persecution to become genocidal in
effect."]{.underline}**\[25\] Military Assaults on Gazan Population With
respect to Israel's most recent military offensive, the so-called
"Operation Protective Edge" launched against Gaza in the summer of 2014,
prominent human rights authorities expressed concern that the campaign
constituted a violation of international humanitarian law as contained
in the Geneva Conventions: **[Amnesty International issued a statement
proclaiming "an International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation is
essential to break the culture of impunity which perpetuates the
commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Israel and the
Occupied Palestinian Territories. The case for such action is made all
the more compelling in the light of the ongoing serious violations of
international humanitarian law being committed by all parties to the
current hostilities in the Gaza Strip and Israel."]{.underline}**\[26\]
The ICC has jurisdiction over genocide, and the U**[.N. Special Advisers
on the Prevention of Genocide issued a statement]{.underline}** two
weeks into the 2014 offensive **[that they were "disturbed by the
flagrant use of hate speech in the social media, particularly against
the Palestinian population," finding that "individuals have disseminated
messages that could be dehumanising to the Palestinians and have called
for the killing of members of this group,"]{.underline}** while
"remind\[ing\] all that incitement to commit atrocity crimes is
prohibited under international law."\[27\] Al-Haq, **[the oldest
Palestinian Human Rights organization, found that serious violations of
international law were committed in the course of the 2014 Israeli
offensive against Gaza.]{.underline}**\[28\] Al-Haq, along with other
Palestinian human rights organizations the Palestinian Center for Human
Rights, Al-Mezan, and Aldameer, submitted a legal file to the
International Criminal Court urging it to open an investigation and
prosecution into the crimes against humanity and war crimes committed
during the course of Israel's 2014 Gaza offensive.\[29\] The crimes
suggested for prosecution by these human rights organizations include
genocide. **[Dozens of Holocaust survivors, together with hundreds of
descendants of Holocaust survivors and victims, accused Israel of
"genocide" for the deaths of more than 2,000 Palestinians in Gaza during
the 2014 Israeli military offensive against Gaza]{.underline}**,
\"Operation Protective Edge\". \[30\] **[Others who have charged that
Israel committed genocide during Operation Cast Lead include Bolivian
President Evo Morales, who recalled that country\'s ambassador from
Israel. He stated, "What is happening in Palestine is
genocide."]{.underline}**\[31\] Author and activist Naomi Wolf wrote, "I
mourn genocide in Gaza because I am the granddaughter of a family half
wiped out in a holocaust and I know genocide when I see it."\[32\]
Israeli Government Statements Targeting Palestinians Finally,
**[prominent Israeli politicians have publicly called for action against
the Palestinian people that unequivocally meets the definition of
genocide under the 1948 Convention.]{.underline}** For instance, in
February 2008, **[Matan Vilnai, Israel's deputy defense minister,
declared that increasing tensions between the Israelis and Palestinians
in the Gaza Strip could bring on themselves what he called a shoah, or
holocaust, "The more Qassam \[rocket\] fire intensifies and the rockets
reach a longer range, they will bring upon themselves a bigger shoah
because we will use all our might to defend
ourselves."]{.underline}**\[33\] **[Israeli Justice Minister Ayelet
Shaked posted a statement on Facebook in June 2014 claiming that "the
entire Palestinian people is the enemy" and called for the destruction
of Palestine, "including its elderly and its women, its cities and its
villages, its property and its infrastructure." Her post also called for
the killing of Palestinian mothers who give birth to "little
snakes."]{.underline}**\[34\] **[In August 2014, Moshe Feiglin,
then-deputy speaker of the Israeli Knesset and member of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's ruling Likud Party, called for the destruction of
Palestinian life in Gaza and offered a detailed plan for shipping
Palestinians living in Gaza across the world. Specifically, he
envisioned a scenario where the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) would find
areas on the Sinai border to establish "tent encampments\...until
relevant emigration destinations are determined." He further suggested
that the IDF would then "exterminate nests of resistance, in the event
that any should remain."]{.underline}**\[35\] **[He subsequently wrote
in an op-ed, "After the IDF completes the 'softening' of the targets
with its fire-power, the IDF will conquer the entire Gaza, using all the
means necessary to minimize any harm to our soldiers, with no other
considerations."]{.underline}**\[36\] **[He continued, "Gaza is part of
our Land and we will remain there forever. Liberation of parts of our
land forever is the only thing that justifies endangering our soldiers
in battle to capture land. Subsequent to the elimination of terror from
Gaza, it will become part of sovereign Israel and will be populated by
Jews. This will also serve to ease the housing crisis in Israel. The
coastal train line will be extended, as soon as possible, to reach the
entire length of Gaza."]{.underline}** Conclusion **[Prominent human
rights advocates and scholars have argued that the killings of
Palestinians and their forceful expulsion from mandate Palestine in
1948, the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza,
and the violence and discrimination directed at Palestinians by the
Israeli government have violated a number of human rights protections
contained in international human rights law, genocide being among
them.]{.underline}**

### Occupation Bad -- Global Settler Colonialism

#### The West Bank is the laboratory for territorial and urban conflict globally -- Contesting settler colonial violence there is key.

**[In this asymmetrical warfare of the entitled against the
disenfranchised, the deadly if preposterous situation emerges that the
most highly armed states in the world assure their populations that they
(or their interests) are under a permanent state of siege, diffusely
threatened by ragtag platoons of the dispossessed who, despite the
considerable differences between them, uniformly qualify for the
indiscriminate designation 'terrorists'.]{.underline}** To note this is
neither to endorse the kaleidoscopic variety of ideologies and religious
beliefs that motivate such groups, nor to collapse into a single
framework of resistance the very diverse phenomena they represent. **[It
is, rather, to problematize a narrative that, for over a decade, has
legitimated the violent rise of the neoliberal state, with its
multiplying encroachments on the civil liberties that were, at least in
name, the hallmark of liberalism; its endless conduct of war in the name
of peace and freedom; its inhuman treatment of refugees and asylum
seekers internationally; its infliction of austerity, incarceration and
police brutality on growing segments of its populations domestically;
and its arbitrary and lethal interventions globally in the name of
humanitarianism. From the hard right to the liberal center, from the
faux frontier bluster of George W. Bush to the moralizing condescension
of Barack Obama, the same rhetoric of defensive and pre-emptive action
against enemies that externally surround or internally infest the nation
reigns.]{.underline}** At the same time, anti-immigrant scare-mongering
conflates migrants, whether driven by economic or political necessities,
with terrorist enemies, militarizing the borders of states in the name
of security. **[Never has Walter Benjamin's aphorism that, from the
perspective of the oppressed, 'the "state of emergency" in which we live
is not the exception but the rule']{.underline}** 2 **[seemed to express
so general a condition.]{.underline}** It is highly significant that the
distinctive characteristics of this emergent global regime have been
locally prefigured in modes of repression developed internally by
settler colonial states. **[As Israeli architect and specialist on urban
warfare, Eyal Weizman, has argued, for instance, the West Bank can be
seen as an extreme model -- perhaps a laboratory -- of a territorial and
urban conflict that can take place in other places.]{.underline}**
Globalization takes the periphery straight to the center, the frontier
between the First and Third worlds starts running through the middle of
world cities.3 **[Weizmann's phrasing signals a genealogy for
contemporary transformations in the longer history of colonialism as a
repertoire of both tropes and practices of social control, brought
together today in Israel's operations as a settler colonial state,
anomalous only in that its project of expansion remains unfinished.4 The
notable convergence of Israel and the USA (together with an
ever-compliant Australia), expressed as much in their political
solidarity as in their military and security collaborations, suggests to
us a wider historical affinity between states that share a settler
colonial history, one that continues to impress itself on both psychic
and institutional formations.]{.underline}** In this respect, to
Weizmann's invocation of the first and third worlds, we should add the
histories of dispossession and resistance through which Indigenous
peoples of the 'fourth world' have shaped our understanding of the
dynamics of settler colonialism and its lessons for the present. **[We
suggest that the fundamental continuity between the historical
development of European settler colonialism and the present-day
development of the neoliberal world order resides in the exigencies of
managing surplus populations. So far as settlers have been concerned,
the salient surplus has, of course, been the Native population, whose
refractory presence has prompted a range of techniques of elimination --
from outright homicide to various forms of removal and/ or confinement,
and, once their numbers have been appropriately reduced in the
post-frontier era, to Natives' assimilation into settler society --
techniques that have met with mixed success in the face of Native modes
of resistance which have varied as creatively as the settlers' own
repertoire of strategies.]{.underline}** In this overall historical
process, the key shift is the ending of the frontier, which generally
coincides with the consolidation of the settler state, and which is
typically marked by intensified programs of Native assimilation, so many
mopping-up exercises for civilization. **[Thus it is consistent that
Israel, which remains bogged down in an incomplete expansion of its
frontier, should rigorously eschew any semblance of Native assimilation,
insisting instead on the sharpest of distinctions between Palestinians,
who may or may not be citizen/residents of the Israeli state, and
members of the so-called 'Jewish nation' wherever they may live. The
exclusion of the Palestinian population is particularly apparent in the
ease with which shifting economic and demographic circumstances --
especially the large-scale immigration of Arab-Jews (Mizrahim) and
Russians -- have transformed what was once a reserve Palestinian labor
force into a largely unemployed surplus. Bereft of potential productive
utility, and with pauperization attenuating its value as a market, the
Palestinian population has become subject to policies of removal and
confinement that recall those adopted by other settler states while the
expansion of their frontiers remained incomplete.]{.underline}**

### Solvency -- BDS

#### Our call joins with activists groups globally to push for a siphoning away of Israeli power that ends the genocide of Palestinian people -- in turn, that spills over to challenge militarization broadly -- but only bottom solutions can get us there

mmv)

Making Common Cause Against Militarization

**[The call for a comprehensive military embargo on Israel is rooted not
only in the Palestinian call to end Israel's impunity and the world's
complicity with its apartheid regime]{.underline}**. **[It is also part
of a global struggle against wars and repression and against the
militarization and securitization of society]{.underline}**. **[There is
increasing awareness of the ways in which Israeli military and "homeland
security" exports are contributing to these practices through new
technologies and methodologies developed in the process of military
occupation, apartheid, and the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian
people]{.underline}**. In turn, militarization and securitization help
to sustain Israel's military industry and its policies against
Palestinians.

**[In parallel to Israel's growing role in this militarization,
movements across the globe are making common cause with the BDS movement
against repression and discrimination by military and police
forces]{.underline}**. The campaign against the Israeli "homeland
security" company International Security and Defense Systems (ISDS) is
an important example. Former Mossad agents founded ISDS in 1982.
Investigative journalists as well as former members of military juntas
report that ISDS trained death squads in Guatemala, El Salvador,
Honduras, and Nicaragua and was implicated in coups and attempted coups
in Honduras and Venezuela.

**[Today ISDS trains the infamous military police force BOPE in Rio de
Janeiro, proudly acknowledging that the police in the favelas (slums)
are using the same techniques Israel uses in Gaza]{.underline}**. ISDS
also secured a high publicity contract with the 2016 Olympic Games in
Rio. **[Palestinian movements such as Stop the Wall and the BDS National
Committee (BNC) have joined forces with popular movements in Rio working
for human rights in the favelas, in a campaign dubbed Olympics without
Apartheid in order to cancel the contract]{.underline}**. 7

Similar connections have been made between the Palestine solidarity
movement and Black activists in the US, who in 2015 issued a statement
of solidarity endorsed by over 1,000 black activists and intellectuals
noting that "**[Israel's widespread use of detention and imprisonment
against Palestinians evokes the mass incarceration of Black people in
the US, including the political imprisonment of our own revolutionaries"
and calling for joint struggle against the security
company]{.underline}** G4S. **[Moreover, in August 2016 the Black Lives
Matter movement endorsed the BDS movement]{.underline}**.

The US-Mexico border wall is another site of joint struggle between
Palestine solidarity activists and the indigenous people affected by the
implementation of Israeli methodologies and technologies on their land,
in which Elbit Systems plays a key role.

The campaign in the EU to stop funding to Elbit Systems and other
Israeli military companies touches on a larger question of concern to
every European citizen. With an €80 billion budget (approximately \$88
billion at end-2015 exchange rates), the current EU research and
development funding cycle Horizon 2020 is among the world's biggest
funding schemes**[. It redistributes taxpayer money mainly to corporate
and academic institutions developing research at the service of big
business, including in cooperation with Israeli military
companies]{.underline}**. **[The research projects with Israeli military
companies often develop dual-use technology (technology for both
military and civilian use) in clear violation of EU regulations and
contribute to the militarization and securitization of European
societies]{.underline}**. Most Europeans, if they knew how their money
was being used, would likely agree that the EU harms not only
Palestinians but also its own citizens by spending on wars that create
new refugees and on technologies that control, racially profile, and
oppress Europeans instead of supporting their needs.

Targeting the Israeli Military's Weak Spots

**[This policy brief has sought to provide an overview of Israel's
military industrial complex and to identify entry points that could
reduce the industry's profits and eventually lead to an arms embargo
until Palestinian rights are achieved]{.underline}**. There is no doubt
that this is a major undertaking: **[The military industrial complex
involves powerful corporations, slick propaganda and marketing, and
global defense establishments that are often far from the discourse and
reach of solidarity activists]{.underline}**. **[Yet it is not only an
ethical necessity for countries to end military relations with Israel
until it upholds international law; it is also a campaign that can be
won. Indeed, based on experience to date, and in light of the above
analysis, there are several entry points for activists to
consider]{.underline}**.

**[At the most basic level, public education and outreach are
essential.]{.underline}** Most people intuitively understand that their
governments should not maintain military relations with an occupying
power that launches regular military assaults against the besieged Gaza
Strip and other neighboring countries as well as commits incursions,
raids, home demolitions, and other human rights violations against the
occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem -- particularly as these acts
violate not only their own moral code but also their countries' laws and
international law. **[The numbers of human rights advocates working for
boycotts and divestment is growing; it is only a matter of time before
the numbers advocating sanctions, and particularly military sanctions,
grow to form a critical mass]{.underline}**.

**[Solidarity with Palestine by communities also impacted by
militarization and securitization has a long history, especially in
Latin America, where Israel and its private agents have for decades
supported and trained death squads and dictatorships]{.underline}**.
**[Strengthened cooperation between Black Americans, Latinos, and
indigenous peoples in the US, paired with the exponential militarization
of European metropoles, mean that a broad and organized network of
campaigners has the potential to develop in the West as
well]{.underline}**. In the case of the EU, a groundswell of public
opinion could be used to back technical arguments to challenge Horizon
2020 funding to Israeli military -- and other entities -- complicit in
the occupation.

**[In their campaigns, activists should also draw on the evidence that
Israeli military technology is neither as effective nor as problem-free
as its public relations purport. The major issues with Israeli drone
production and the questions surrounding the Iron Dome are just two
examples]{.underline}**. **[Even more compelling is the fact that Israel
is undermining country capacity to manage its own defense, siphoning
countries' national industrial capacity to Israel and using its security
systems to spy on country clients, effectively resulting in their loss
of national sovereignty and independence]{.underline}**.

**[Elbit Systems, big as it is, is particularly vulnerable to activist
action. It is the only Israeli private military company of this size and
hence is more vulnerable to crises, risks of financial speculation, and
economic restructuring]{.underline}**. Elbit Systems is highly indebted
and needs to ensure a continuous cash flow to service that debt. **[Its
ever more global presence makes it easier for activists in different
countries to take on Elbit or its subsidiaries]{.underline}**. In
addition, **[the growing dependence of the military industry on the
Israeli state budget to rescue it also makes it vulnerable, while
increasing the vulnerability of the state]{.underline}**.

Activists should also learn from the lessons of experience: **[Israel
always positions itself to take advantage when new governments come to
power or new national policies are passed. Activists too should position
themselves by developing contingency plans to deal with changes in
governments]{.underline}**. **[It is key to secure, where possible,
commitments or legislation from friendly governments against military
trade with Israel and to take advantage of instances in which hostile
governments enact policies that contradict Israeli
interests]{.underline}**. Leveraging internal dynamics in such instances
is an essential element for success.

#### Top down approaches will fail -- specifically state based solutions have become trapped in wrecking tactics designed to derail progress -- without external pressure from the local level, the UN and the US will continue to justify Israeli occupation and violence 

**Rodriguez 2013** (Timothy Rodriguez, former Peace Corps volunteer,
Gaza Freedom March and Egyptian Uprising participant, \"Resolving the
Israel-Palestine Conflict with Activism\", Transformative Studies
Institute, Journal of Social Justice, Vol 3, 2013,
transformativestudies.org/wp-content/uploads/Resolving-the-Israel-Palestine-Conflict-with-Activism.pdf,
mmv)

The combination of the findings from the ICJ on the issues of borders,
settlements, and Jerusalem as well as the \"right of return\" for
refugees, cover all of the \"outstanding problems,\" as the ICJ puts it,
to the Israel- Palestine conflict. **[Like all other conflicts, this
merely resolves the immediate matters of dispute and allows for further
reconciliation and progress to a more sustainable and stable peace. If
we disregard international law on this issue, we not only scrap the
basic principle of the rule of law, but lose any sense of justice in
conflict resolution]{.underline}**. For approximately four decades, the
U.N. General Assembly has reiterated the same peace settlement with the
same standards of international law as the ICJ found. As one can tell
from the ICJ advisory opinion, the principles outlined are not very
complex or controversial. **[In fact, the crucial question of the
settlements was unanimously found to be a \"flagrant violation\" of
international law by the ICJ, including by the U.S. judge. One can also
find the same pattern of near unanimous opinion when reviewing the
record of votes on the \"Question of Palestine\" at the U.N. General
Assembly]{.underline}**.

Each year the General Assembly votes on the international consensus for
a peaceful settlement to what they refer to as the \"Question of
Palestine\", and every year you have approximately the entire world in
favor, a few states abstaining, and a few states opposing. The year 2011
proved no differently. As the General Assembly summarized:

As in previous sessions, the Assembly adopted, by 167 in favour to 7
against (Canada, Israel, Marshall Islands, Federated States of
Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, United States) with 4 abstentions (Australia,
Cameroon, Cote d\'lvoire, Tonga), a broad-based resolution on the
peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine. (General-Assembly,
2011)

**[The General Assembly also voted on support for the Middle East peace
process, Palestinian self-determination, and a halt to Israel\'s
expansion into East Jerusalem and control of the Golan
Heights]{.underline}**, with a similar outcome in votes. **[Glaringly,
we see that the largest global power, the United States, sides against
the international consensus. As a result of its overwhelming amount of
political power, the United States is in effect vetoing a peaceful
settlement of the conflict]{.underline}**. **[As was the case with South
African Apartheid, if the U.S. chooses to block a settlement that
addresses the underlying grievances]{.underline}** (in this case
borders, settlements, Jerusalem, and refugees), **[the conflict is
likely to continue]{.underline}**. Considering recent U.S. actions that
included opposing Palestinian membership to the United Nations, vetoing
a U.N. Security Council resolution for a settlement freeze, and
supporting Israel in its latest bombing of Gaza, the U.S. position is
all too clear.

The central U.N. document that provides the basis for the \"Question of
Palestine\" is U.N. Resolution 242, which reaffirms the
\"inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war,\" and calls
for a \"withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in
the recent conflict\" and a \"just settlement of the refugee problem\"
as a precondition for \"peace within secure and recognized boundaries
free from threats or acts of force.\" (General-Assembly, 1967) The
Palestinians have accepted this resolution with their endorsement of the
Arab League Proposal and further negotiations with Israel over the past
decade, as was made clear by the Palestine Papers (leaked internal
documents) released by A1 Jazeera, even calling for full normalization
with Israel. If Israel accepts the international consensus, Palestinians
and Israelis must adhere to each others\' \"right to live in peace with
secure and recognized boundaries free from the threats or acts of
force.\" (General-Assembly, 1967) **[Since there is an international
consensus that is opposed by Israel and the United States at the United
Nations, it\'s curious that these two countries lead separate
negotiations typically referred to in the media and intellectual culture
as the \"Peace Process\". The 2011 negotiations with the U.S. acting as
mediator unsurprisingly produced another dead end]{.underline}**.
Jonathan Freedland, who was present at the negotiations, reported in The
Guardian that **[although Israel continues to deny Palestinian
refugees\' right of return or compensation, the U.S. text included the
\"1967 lines and Jerusalem,\" which are two of the \"final status\"
issues]{.underline}** (a position rejected by Israel in public), **[but,
at the same time, \"repeatedly insisted that we recognize Israel as a
Jewish State \... No such demand had been made for past peace
agreements: to demand it now was surely a wrecking
tactic.\"]{.underline}** (Freedland, 2011)

**[The demand for recognition of a \"Jewish State\" has some
problems]{.underline}**. For one, **[what does it mean to be a Jewish
State? What will it mean for the non-Jewish peoples]{.underline}**,
**[particularly Arabs]{.underline}**, **[living in
Israel?]{.underline}** **[From the position of Palestinians, it suggests
a hint of racism and, furthermore, a demand that is not forced upon any
other state or entity as a condition for peaceful
relations]{.underline}**. Flabbergasted by such a demand. Abbas
explained how, \"they started talking to me about a \'Jewish State\'
only two years ago \... It is not my job to give a description of the
state. Name yourself the Hebrew Socialist Republic - it is none of my
business.\" (Seidl, 2011) **[A similar \"wrecking tactic\" was Israel\'s
insistence on Palestine recognizing its \"right to exist,\" which has no
basis under international law and is vague in that it doesn\'t define
the parameters around \"exist\" unless we were to once again refer back
to the \"final status\" questions and the international
consensus]{.underline}**.

**[Obama added another \"wrecking tactic\" by insisting on \"mutually
agreed swaps\" of land. This undercuts any success at a settlement since
Israel\'s position is to acquire Palestinian land and not \"go back to
the 1967 lines \... Those are indefensible]{.underline}**,\" as Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu explained. (Knickerbocker, 2011) As
with the U.S.- Israeli \"Peace Process\" in general, this \"wrecking
tactic\" rejects international law as a workable basis and favors
Israel, who could decide not to \"mutually agree\", making the \"Peace
Process\" moot. And so the conflict proceeds.

**[The question then becomes: how do we proceed to resolve the conflict
if the two crucial parties - Israel and the United States - reject the
international consensus and proceed with a \"Peace Process\" that
consists of \"wrecking tactics\"?]{.underline}** Similar to overcoming
South African Apartheid, **[it is up to an active citizenry among the
international community to apply, through non-violent activism, the
necessary political pressure to enforce international
law]{.underline}**. Being a citizen of the United States, it is my
responsibility, and our task in conflict management, to see to it that
the U.S. shifts its position of rejection to acceptance of the
international consensus.

**[There are two strategies that can help achieve a just resolution:
Continued mediation through the United Nations, and nonviolent
activism]{.underline}**. The United Nations route has been taken
frequently in the form of Security Council and General Assembly
resolutions only to be vetoed by the United States. Most recently, the
Palestinian Authority led by Mahmoud Abbas confronted the \"Question of
Palestine\" head-on as they brought the issue of self-determination and
state-hood before the United Nations. Staring at yet another U.S. veto
at the Security Council, Palestinian representatives merely sought and
received recognition through the United Nations Educational, Scientific,
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). As punishment, the U.S. decided to
sanction the Palestinians - one could say again considering U.S. support
for the blockade on Gaza - by withholding aid, as well as cutting S80
million in U.S. annual dues to UNESCO (a quarter of its budget) causing
a crisis within the agency. (Ganley, 2011) The Palestinian Authority
will bring up statehood again with even greater support this year.
**[Relying on state actors alone, and considering the overwhelming power
of one of them - the United States - U.N. negotiations and resolutions
based on international law are blocked and unenforceable]{.underline}**.
**[Similarly, a resolution to end apartheid in South Africa proved
impossible through the U.N. until public pressure forced the U.S. to
change is position]{.underline}**. **[It\'s therefore necessary to
review the role of non-violent activism to bring about a resolution to
the Israel-Palestine conflict as it has for so many other conflicts
throughout history]{.underline}**.

### Solvency -- US support key

#### Ending funds solves---Occupation is only sustainable because of US support.

**Bennis 16** (Phyllis, Fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies and
Director of the New Internationalism Project "Record \$38 Billion in
Military Aid to Israel is a 'Statement of Absolute Support' for Israeli
Occupation"
<https://ips-dc.org/record-38-billion-military-aid-israel-statement-absolute-support-israeli-occupation/>)
NIJ

**["The package is again a statement of absolute support for Israeli
occupation, colonization, and apartheid," Phyllis Bennis told the Real
News Network in response to the \$38 billion package of U.S. military
aid promised to Israel.]{.underline}** Bennis said **[this deal is not
about Israeli defenses.]{.underline}** The Obama administration has said
that **[Israeli's occupation of Palestine is not sustainable. But it
becomes sustainable]{.underline}**, Bennis said, **[when the U.S.
finances billions in American tax dollars]{.underline}**, "more than has
been given to any other country for military assistance, including even
Iraq in the ten years of the Iraq War, from 2003 to 2011." Bennis called
the amount of money "outrageous," for the 23rd wealtlhiest country in
the world. She also said that to call the stipulation that Israel must
spend some of the aid on the U.S. war industry rather than building
their own a concession "simply doesn't stand up," as that standard
applies to all of the other countries the U.S. provides aid to. **[As
for the provision that Israel is not to ask for more money unless
there's an emergency]{.underline}**, Bennis said, "As we know, **[Israel
creates the emergencies. Israel is the one who goes to war against Gaza
and then demands that the U.S. send more bullets when they use them up,
or more planes or more bombs.]{.underline}**" Independent journalist
Rania Khalek said it's "stunning" that Israel is prioritized over the
interests of Americans during a time when "our government seems to be
incapable of providing basic services in parts of this country, like
clean drinking water and like functioning schools." **["We're able to
always come up with this money to spend to not only enable but literally
fund Israel's ongoing destruction of Palestinian families and
communities,"]{.underline}** Khalek said. This comes at a time when,
Khalek said, **[the current Israeli government is the most racist
government that's been elected in Israel's history. She said government
officials have called for beheadings of disloyal Palestinians, "ISIS
language," and slaughtering mothers in their beds to prevent them from
birthing 'little snakes,' "the language of genocide." "We're arming this
government and giving them the weapons they need to commit absolute
savagery against a totally defenseless population,"]{.underline}**
Khalek said. Bennis says Obama is "seriously misreading" where the
American people are on the Palestinian question. "The public discourse
on this question has shifted," she said. **["There is massive opposition
to Israeli actions in the United States today, particularly importantly
in the Jewish community, where there's been an enormous shift in that
discourse."]{.underline}** Obama has had public confrontations with
Netanyahu, Bennis explained, but **[if the administration continues to
give billions in military aid every year to Israel, and continue to
"provide absolute impunity at the United Nations, using their veto or a
threat of veto or a threat of other punishments to make sure that Israel
is never held accountable for its potential war crimes, that's what
matters in the U.S.-Israeli relationship, and all the rest is just
words."]{.underline}**

#### Ending funds solves -- US funds empower Israel both politically and militaristically to commit atrocities. US funds alone account for 1/5^th^ of Israel's defense budget.

**Marcetic 4/19** (Branko, Jacobin Staff Writer "AOC Is Right About Aid
to Israel"
<https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/04/ocasio-cortez-israel-aid-united-states>)
NIJ

For one thing, **[US military aid to Israel is already supposed to be
illegal under the]{.underline}** so-called **[Leahy Laws. Those laws bar
the US government from giving training, equipment, and other types of
assistance to any overseas security forces committing "gross violations
of human rights,"]{.underline}** which include torture and extrajudicial
killing. There is copious evidence of **[the Israeli military routinely
killing protesters]{.underline}**, including teenagers and medics ---
often from sniper positions hundreds of feet away --- despite the
plethora of nonlethal, high-tech options it has to repel demonstrators.
**[One could go further back and cite the Israeli military's
indiscriminate bombing and shelling of Gaza, or the frequent reports of
Israeli torture of Palestinians, documented by the United Nations and
other organizations.]{.underline}** But the recent sniper killings alone
are sufficient. But forget about the rule of law. Even by the warped
moral standards of Washington, D.C., **[Israel has crossed a red
line]{.underline}**, with **[the UN determining this past February that
Israeli forces had killed and wounded clearly marked journalists and
medics during last year's Gaza protests.]{.underline}** Saudi Arabia
killing a single journalist last year was considered so shocking and
outrageous that its government received months of well-deserved
condemnation, including from many who had previously been enthusiastic
supporters of the Kingdom, leading to Congress's historic attempt to end
US support for the country's war in Yemen. Unless the argument is Saudi
Arabia would have been on solid ground if it had simply murdered Jamal
Khashoggi by sniper fire, this is clearly a double standard. Then
there's the political element. **[Even a committed liberal Zionist would
have to admit the direction of Israeli politics is now entering scary
new territory. To win the most recent election, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu teamed up with far-right ultranationalists]{.underline}** who
are so toxic, even AIPAC --- AIPAC! --- condemned the alliance and
refuses to meet with them. **[Netanyahu has spent the past few years
cozying up to far-right, racist governments in Europe, drumming up
hatred domestically, and trying to centralize power.]{.underline}** Even
Beto O'Rourke, who seems pathologically unwilling to articulate and
stick to a political position, has called him "racist." **[That's not
even to mention the most central criticism of Israel: its decades-long
subjugation of the Palestinian people, its flouting of the international
peace process, and its continued violation of international law in
regard to the conflict. If Americans are alarmed by Israel's
actions]{.underline}** --- be they the killing and abuse of innocent
people, targeting of journalists, drift towards the global far right, or
treatment of Palestinians --- **[they have a relatively straightforward
piece of leverage they can use to seek to change its behavior: the
billions of dollars of military and economic aid the US government sends
to Israel every year, which has made the country the largest cumulative
recipient of US foreign assistance since the Second World War and
accounts for nearly one-fifth of the country's defense budget. There is
no other country on the planet that has this kind of arrangement, let
alone an apartheid state that is openly vying to become a member of a
far-right, authoritarian international alliance.]{.underline}** One of
the most pathetic moments in the history of US leadership took place in
2016. After Netanyahu spent years ignoring Obama's calls to halt illegal
settlements, quietly tried to get his opponent elected in 2012, and made
an unprecedented, widely criticized speech to Congress that he never
bothered to clear with the president, in an effort to derail his foreign
policy, Obama punished Israel by ... negotiating the largest military
aid deal in US history with the country. Why on earth would Israel ever
change its behavior when its leaders have been conditioned to understand
it won't be punished by any member of the US political class, and may in
fact be rewarded? So yes, cutting or outright withdrawing aid to Israel
should be "on the table" --- to say the least. **[Decades of unflinching
financial support for Israel no matter what atrocity it commits or norm
it violates has given its leaders the completely correct belief they can
do anything they want without consequence. It's time to prove them
wrong.]{.underline}**

set at odds with larger scale ethical concerns, especially large-scale
future events of forecasted suffering. Emergency planning is a
particularly good example in which the large-scale threats of future
suffering can distort moral reasoning.]{.underline}** Žižek (2006)
lightly develops this point in the context of the war on terror, where
**[in the presence of fictitious and real ticking clocks and warning
systems, the urgent body must be bypassed because there are bigger
scales to worry about: What does this all-pervasive sense of urgency
mean ethically? The pressure of events is so overbearing, the stakes are
so high, that they necessitate a suspension of ordinary ethical
concerns.]{.underline}** After all, displaying moral qualms when the
lives of millions are at stake plays into the hands of the enemy.
(Žižek, 2006) **[In the presence of large-scale future emergency, the
urgency to secure the state, the citizenry, the economy, or the climate
creates new scales and new temporal orders of response]{.underline}**
(see Anderson, 2010; Baldwin, 2012; Dalby, 2013; Morrissey, 2012),
**[many of which treat the urgent body as impulsive and thus requiring
management.]{.underline}** McDonald's (2013) analysis of three
interconnected discourses of 'climate security' illustrates how bodily
urgency in climate change is also recast as a menacing impulse that
might require exclusion from moral reckoning. **[The logics
of]{.underline}** climate security, especially those related to
**[national security, 'can encourage perverse political responses that
not only fail to respond effectively]{.underline}** to climate change
**[but may present victims of it as a threat']{.underline}** (McDonald,
2013: 49). **[Bodies that are currently suffering cannot be urgent,
because they are excluded from the potential collectivity that could be
suffering everywhere in some future time.]{.underline}** **[Similar
bypassing of existing bodily urgency is echoed in writing about violent
securitization]{.underline}**, such as drone warfare (Shaw and Akhter,
2012), **[and also in intimate scales like the street and the school,
especially in relation to race]{.underline}** (Mitchell, 2009; Young et
al., 2014). **[As large-scale urgent concerns are institutionalized, the
urgent body is increasingly obscured through technical planning and
coordination]{.underline}** (Anderson and Adey, 2012). The predominant
characteristic of this institutionalization of large-scale emergency is
a 'built-in bias for action' (Wuthnow, 2010: 212) that circumvents
contingencies. **[The urgent body is at best an assumed eventuality, one
that will likely require another state of waiting]{.underline}**, such
as triage (e.g. Greatbach et al., 2005). Amin (2013) cautions that in
much of the West, governmental need to provide evidence of laissez-faire
governing on the one hand, and assurance of strength in facing a
threatening future on the other, produces 'just-in-case preparedness'
(Amin, 2013: 151) of neoliberal risk management policies. In the US,
**['personal ingenuity' is built into emergency response at the expense
of the poor and vulnerable for whom '\[t\]he difference between
abjection and bearable survival']{.underline}** (Amin, 2013: 153)
**[will not be determined by emergency planning]{.underline}**, but in
the material infrastructure of the city. In short, **[the urgencies of
the body provide justifications for social exclusion of the most
marginalized based on impulse and perceived threat, while large-scale
future emergencies effectively absorb the deliberative power of urgency
into the institutions of preparedness and risk avoidance.]{.underline}**
Žižek references Arendt's (2006) analysis of the banality of evil to
explain the current state of ethical reasoning under the war on terror,
noting that **[people who perform morally reprehensible actions under
the conditions of urgency assume a 'tragic-ethic
grandeur']{.underline}** (Žižek, 2006) **[by sacrificing their own
morality for the good of the state.]{.underline}** But his analysis
fails to note that bodies are today so rarely legitimate sites for
claiming urgency. **[In the context of the assumed priority of the
large-scale future emergency, the urgent body becomes literally
nonsense, a non sequitur within societies, states and worlds that will
always be more urgent. If the important ethical work of urgency has been
to identify that which must not wait, then the capture of the power and
persuasiveness of urgency by large-scale future emergencies has
consequences for the kinds of normative arguments we can raise on behalf
of urgent bodies.]{.underline}** How, then, might waiting compare as a
normative description and critique in our own urgent time? Waiting can
be categorized according to its purpose or outcome (see Corbridge, 2004;
Gray, 2011), but it also modifies the place of the individual in society
and her importance. As Ramdas (2012: 834) writes, 'waiting ... produces
hierarchies which segregate people and places into those which matter
and those which do not'. The segregation of waiting might produce
effects that counteract suffering, however, and Jeffery (2008: 957)
explains that though the 'politics of waiting' can be repressive, it can
also engender creative political engagement. In his research with
educated unemployed Jat youth who spend days and years waiting for
desired employment, Jeffery finds that 'the temporal suffering and sense
of ambivalence experienced by young men can generate cultural and
political experiments that, in turn, have marked social and spatial
effects' (Jeffery, 2010: 186). Though this is not the same as claiming
normative neutrality for waiting, it does suggest that waiting is more
ethically ambivalent and open than urgency. In other contexts, however,
our descriptions of waiting indicate a strong condemnation of its
effects upon the subjects of study. Waiting can demobilize radical
reform, depoliticizing 'the insurrectionary possibilities of the present
by delaying the revolutionary imperative to a future moment that is
forever drifting towards infinity' (Springer, 2014: 407). Yonucu's
(2011) analysis of the self-destructive activities of disrespected
working-class youth in Istanbul suggests that this sense of infinite
waiting can lead not only to depoliticization, but also to a disbelief
in the possibility of a future self of any value. Waiting, like urgency,
can undermine the possibility of self-care two-fold, first by making
people wait for essential needs, and again by reinforcing that waiting
is '\[s\]omething to be ashamed of because it may be noted or taken as
evidence of indolence or low status, seen as a symptom of rejection or a
signal to exclude' (Bauman, 2004: 109). This is why Auyero (2012)
suggests that waiting creates an ideal state subject, providing
'temporal processes in and through which political subordination is
produced' (Auyero, 2012: loc. 90; see also Secor, 2007). Furthermore,
Auyero notes, it is not only political subordination, but the subjective
effect of waiting that secures domination, as citizens and non-citizens
find themselves 'waiting hopefully and then frustratedly for others to
make decisions, and in effect surrendering to the authority of others'
(Auyero, 2012: loc. 123). Waiting can therefore function as a
potentially important spatial technology of the elite and powerful,
mobilized not only for the purpose of governing individuals, but also to
retain claims over moral urgency. But there is growing resistance to the
capture of claims of urgency by the elite, and it is important to note
that even in cases where the material conditions of containment are
currently impenetrable, arguments based on human value are at the
forefront of reclaiming urgency for the body. In detention centers,
clandestine prisons, state borders and refugee camps, geographers point
to ongoing struggles against the ethical impossibility of bodily urgency
and a rejection of states of waiting (see Conlon, 2011; Darling, 2009,
2011; Garmany, 2012; Mountz et al., 2013; Schuster, 2011).
Ramakrishnan's (2014) analysis of a Delhi resettlement colony and
Shewly's (2013) discussion of the enclave between India and Bangladesh
describe people who refuse to give up their own status as legitimately
urgent, even in the context of larger scale politics. Similarly, Tyler's
(2013) account of desperate female detainees stripping off their clothes
to expose their humanness and suffering in the Yarl's Wood Immigration
Removal Centre in the UK suggests that demands for recognition are not
just about politics, but also about the acknowledgement of humanness and
the irrevocable possibility of being that which cannot wait. The
continued existence of places like Yarl's Wood and similar institutions
in the USA nonetheless points to the challenge of exposing the urgent
body as a moral priority when it is so easily hidden from view, and also
reminds us that our research can help to explain the relationships
between normative dimensions and the political and social conditions of
struggle. In closing, geographic depictions of waiting do seem to
evocatively describe otherwise obscured suffering (e.g. Bennett, 2011),
but it is striking how rarely these descriptions also use the language
of urgency. Given the discussion above, **[what might be accomplished --
and risked -- by incorporating urgency more overtly and deliberately
into our discussions of waiting, surplus and abandoned bodies? Urgency
can clarify the implicit but understated ethical consequences and
normativity associated with waiting, and encourage explicit discussion
about harmful suffering.]{.underline}** Waiting can be productive or
unproductive for radical praxis, but urgency compels and requires
response. Geographers could be instrumental in reclaiming the ethical
work of urgency in ways that leave it open for critique, clarifying
common spatial misunderstandings and representations. **[There is good
reason to be thoughtful in this process, since moral outrage towards
inhumanity can itself obscure differentiated experiences of being human,
dividing up 'those for whom we feel urgent unreasoned concern and those
whose lives and deaths simply do not touch us, or do not appear as lives
at all']{.underline}** (Butler, 2009: 50). **[But when the urgent body
is rendered as only waiting, both materially and discursively, it is
just as easily cast as impulsive, disgusting, animalistic]{.underline}**
(see also McKittrick, 2006). Feminist theory insists that **[the urgent
body, whose encounters of violence are 'usually framed as private,
apolitical and mundane']{.underline}** (Pain, 2014: 8), **[are as deeply
political, public, and exceptional as other forms of
violence]{.underline}** (Phillips, 2008; Pratt, 2005). **[Insisting that
a suffering body, now, is that which cannot wait, has the ethical effect
of drawing it into consideration alongside the political, public and
exceptional scope of large-scale futures. It may help us insist on the
body, both as a single unit and a plurality, as a legitimate scale of
normative priority and social care.]{.underline}**

#### Reject low probability impacts -- creates serial policy failure.

**Kessler 08** (Oliver, Professor of Sociology at the University of
Bielefeld "From Insecurity to Uncertainty: Risk and the Paradox of
Security Politics" *Alternatives* 33, p. 224-226) NIJ

The problem of the second method is that **[it is very difficult to
\"calculate\" politically unacceptable losses. If]{.underline}** the
**[risk]{.underline}** of terrorism **[is defined in traditional terms
by probability and potential loss, then the focus on
dramatic]{.underline}** terror **[attacks leads to the marginalization
of probabilities. The reason is that even the highest degree of
improbability becomes irrelevant as the measure of loss goes to
infinity.]{.underline}** **[The mathematical calculation of the
risk]{.underline}** of terrorism thus **[tends to overestimate and to
dramatize the danger. This has consequences beyond the actual risk
assessment for the formulation and execution of \"risk policies\": If
one factor of the risk calculation approaches infinity]{.underline}**
(e.g., if a case of nuclear terrorism is envisaged), **[then there is no
balanced measure]{.underline}** for antiterrorist efforts, **[and risk
management as a rational endeavor breaks down.]{.underline}** Under the
historical condition of bipolarity, **[the \"ultimate\" threat with
nuclear weapons could be balanced by a similar counterthreat, and new
equilibria could be achieved, albeit on higher levels of nuclear
overkill. Under the new condition of uncertainty, no such rational
balancing is possible since knowledge about actors, their motives and
capabilities, is largely absent.]{.underline}** The second form of
security policy that emerges when the deterrence model collapses mirrors
the \"social probability\" approach. **[It represents a logic of
catastrophe.]{.underline}** In contrast to risk management framed in
line with logical probability theory, **[the logic of catastrophe does
not attempt to provide means of absorbing uncertainty. Rather, it takes
uncertainty as constitutive for the logic itself; uncertainty is a
crucial precondition for catastrophies. In particular, catastrophes
happen at once, without a warning, but with major implications for the
world polity.]{.underline}** In this category, we find the impact of
meteorites. Mars attacks, the tsunami in South East Asia, and 9/11. To
conceive of terrorism as catastrophe has consequences for the
formulation of an adequate security policy. **[Since catastrophes happen
irrespectively of human activity or inactivity, no political action
could possibly prevent them.]{.underline}** Of course, **[there are
precautions that can be taken, but the framing of]{.underline}**
terrorist attack as a **[catastrophe points to spatial and temporal
characteristics that are beyond \"rationality.\" Thus, political
decision makers are exempted from the responsibility to provide
security---as long as they at least try to preempt an
attack.]{.underline}** Interestingly enough, 9/11 was framed as
catastrophe in various commissions dealing with the question of who was
responsible and whether it could have been prevented. **[This makes
clear that under the condition of uncertainty, there are no objective
criteria that could serve as an anchor for measuring dangers and
assessing the quality of political responses.]{.underline}** For
example, **[as much as one might object to certain measures by the US
administration, it is almost impossible to \"measure\" the success of
countermeasures.]{.underline}** Of course, **[there might be a
subjective assessment of specific shortcomings or failures, but there is
no \"common\" currency to evaluate them. As a consequence, the framework
of the security dilemma fails to capture the basic
uncertainties.]{.underline}** Pushing the door open for the security
paradox, the main problem of security analysis then becomes the question
how to integrate dangers in risk assessments and security policies about
which simply nothing is known. In the mid 1990s, a Rand study entitled
\"New Challenges for Defense Planning\" addressed this issue arguing
that \"**[most striking is the fact that we do not even know who or what
will constitute the most serious future threat, \" In order to cope with
this challenge it would be essential]{.underline}**, another Rand
researcher wrote, **[to break free from the \"tyranny\" of plausible
scenario planning. The decisive step would be to create \"discontinuous
scenarios \... in which there is no plausible audit trail or storyline
from current events\"]{.underline}**52 **[These nonstandard scenarios
were later called \"wild cards\" and became important in the current US
strategic discourse.]{.underline}** They justified the transformation
from a threat-based toward a capability- based defense planning
strategy.53 **[The problem with this kind of risk assessment
is]{.underline}**, however, **[that even the most absurd scenarios can
gain plausibility. By constructing a chain of potentialities, improbable
events are linked and brought into the realm of the possible, if not
even the probable. \"Although the likelihood of the scenario dwindles
with each step, the residual impression is one of plausibility.
\"]{.underline}**54 This so-called Othello effect has been effective in
the dawn of the recent war in Iraq. The connection between Saddam
Hussein and Al Qaeda that the US government tried to prove was disputed
from the very beginning. False evidence was again and again presented
and refuted, but this did not prevent the administration from presenting
as the main rationale for war the improbable yet possible connection
between Iraq and the terrorist network and the improbable yet possible
proliferation of an improbable yet possible nuclear weapon into the
hands of Bin Laden. As Donald Rumsfeld famously said: \"Absence of
evidence is not evidence of absence.\" This sentence indicates that
under the condition of genuine uncertainty, different evidence criteria
prevail than in situations where security problems can be assessed with
relative certainty.

### Framing -- Structural Violence 🡪 Extinction

#### Settler colonialism is a driver of extinction---it must be prioritized.

**Mitchell 17** (Audra, Canada Research Chair in Global Political
Ecology at Wilfrid Laurier University "Decolonizing Against Extinction
Part I: Extinction Is Violence"

NIJ

**['Structural violence' involves systemic forms of harm, exclusion and
discrimination that disproportionately affect particular groups, and
which can take many forms (physical, psychological, economic, gendered
and others). They are embedded in and expressed through political,
cultural, economic and social structures]{.underline}** (Farmer 2009)
**[that can persist across large spans of time and space. I use the term
'transversal' to refer to forms of structural violence that extend
across multiple boundaries]{.underline}** -- not only those of
nation-states, but also other kinds of nations (human and otherwise),
communities or kinship groups, and temporalities. **[Prime examples of
transversal structural violence include: settler
colonialism]{.underline}**, colonial genocides (Woolford et al 2014);
environmental racism or 'slow violence', including toxification and
pollution; and complexes of sexual, physical, communal, spiritual and
land-based violence associated with the extractive industries. Each of
**[these forms of violence is ecologically devastating, and their
convergence in European projects of colonisation is even more so. Many
formations of transversal structural violence are significant causes of
the so-called 'four horsemen' of extinction]{.underline}** mentioned
above. For instance, **['direct killing' is carried out to clear land
for settlement, and it occurs as a result of ecological damage caused by
resource extraction. Settler colonialism, carbon-based economies and
regimes of environmental racism also support forms of socio-economic
organization]{.underline}** (for instance, carbon and energy-intensive
urbanized societies) **[that intensify climate change and increase
habitat destruction. Meanwhile, colonization has played a significant
role in the ongoing transfer of life forms across the planet -- whether
unintentionally]{.underline}** (e.g. the transfer of fish in the bilge
water of ships); **[as an instrument of agricultural
settlement]{.underline}** (e.g. cattle ranching), **[or as a deliberate
strategy of violence]{.underline}** (e.g. smallpox). However,
**[transversal structural violence is a driver of extinction in
itself]{.underline}**, with its own distinct manifestations. **[First,
it involves the disruption or severance of relations and kinship
structures between human communities and other life forms, and the
dissolution of Indigenous systems of governance, laws and protocols that
have co-created and sustained plural worlds over
millennia]{.underline}** (Borrows 2010; Atleo 2012; Kimmerer 2013).
**[Second, the destruction of Indigenous knowledges through policies of
assimilation, expropriation, cultural appropriation and other strategies
undermines these forms of order and the relationships they nurture.
Third, the displacement of and/or restricted access to land by
Indigenous peoples interferes with practices of caring for land or
Country that are necessary for the survival of humans and other life
forms]{.underline}** (Bawaka Country 2015). **[Colonial genocides embody
all of these forms of destruction by killing or displacing Indigenous
communities, undermining Indigenous modes of governance and kinship
systems, systematically destroying relationships between life forms and
erasing knowledge. All of these modes of violence weaken co-constitutive
relationships between Indigenous communities, other life forms and
ecosystems that have enabled their collaborative
survival.]{.underline}** This results in disruptions to ecosystems --
and climate -- that Potawatomi scholar Kyle Powys Whyte (2016) has
recently argued would have been considered a dystopia by his Ancestors.
**[In other words, transversal structural violence, and colonial
violence in particular, are fundamental drivers of global patterns of
extinction.]{.underline}** It stands to reason, then, that responses to
extinction that focus on managing endangered species or populations, or
'backing up' genetic material, are insufficient: they leave the
structures of violence intact and may add to their power. Instead,
**[efforts to address extinction need to focus on identifying,
confronting and dismantling these formations of violence, and on
restoring or strengthening the relations they sever.]{.underline}** Yet
responses to global patterns of extinction are overwhelmingly rooted in
Western scientific concepts of conservation -- a paradigm that emerged
within 20th century European colonial government structures (Adams
2004). Contemporary conservation approaches -- from the creation of land
and marine parks to the archiving of genetic materials -- may exacerbate
the destruction of relations between Indigenous peoples and their
relations. For instance, conservation strategies often involve
displacing Indigenous peoples from the land that they care for (Jago
2017, Brockington and Igoe 2006), or curtailing of processes such as
subsistence hunting, fishing or burning that have enabled the
co-survival of Indigenous groups, plants, animals and land for
millennia. Meanwhile, ex situ and genetic forms of conservation
(including zoos and gene banks) may violate these relationships by
instrumentalizing or commodifying kinship relations. Increasingly
popular conservation approaches based on Traditional Ecological
Knowledge (TEK) approaches claim to center Indigenous communities and
knowledges. However, they ultimately instrumentalize fragments of
Indigenous knowledge systems (for instance, data on climatic change) to
test or support Western approaches. As such, they leave the structures
of colonization and other forms of transversal structural violence
untouched, and may even exacerbate them. **[All of this suggests that
confronting global patterns of extinction calls for decolonization and
other ethos that work to eliminate transversal structural
violence]{.underline}** -- and I don't mean this metaphorically.
Enabling the restoration of relations that can enable the ongoing
flourishing of life on earth will require the transfer of land and power
back into plural Indigenous peoples and their distinct modes of
sovereignty, law and governance (Tuck and Yang 2012). These
relationships and forms of order have enabled plural Indigenous peoples
and their multitude of relations to co-flourish for millennia, including
through periods of rapid climate change, and they are needed to ensure
the continuation of this co-flourishing. **[This means that
decolonization is not simply related to global patterns of extinction:
it is necessary to ensuring the ongoingness of plural life forms on
earth.]{.underline}**

### Framing -- Structural Violence First

**Prioritize structural violence---violence operates on a continuum that
mediates the manifestation of direct violence and forms its condition of
possibility. Reject a symptomatic approach to violence that normalizes
everyday atrocities.**

Social Suffering." The Oxford Handbook of the Social Science of Poverty.

In an effort to address violence as a global public health problem, the
World Health Organization (WHO), developed a typology (Krug et al. 2002)
that focuses on [a]{.underline} (p. 53) "[minimalist" notion of violence
as direct and physical force]{.underline}, with no mention of structural
violence despite recognizing poverty as an important risk factor in all
kinds of violence (Bufacchi 2007:23; Perry 2009:377). As this example
illustrates, typologies of violence, while useful (Rutherford et al.
2007), [can lead to narrow conceptualizations of social
issues]{.underline}. In addition, within real-life contexts, such
categories are fluid and not so easily delineated. For example, in their
discussion of how [interpersonal physical violence]{.underline} becomes
a routine part of everyday urban life for vulnerable and marginalized
groups, Singer and Erickson (2011a) identify the subsets of "street
violence" and "private violence," subcategories that often overlap or
merge. Rape, especially gang rape, can be a form of street violence but
most often (certainly in the United States) occurs out of public view.
In both instances it [is often linked to structural factors, such as
poverty and gender inequality, and to sociocultural meanings ascribed to
women and their bodies. Rape can also be political violence when used
systematically as a weapon of aggression or war]{.underline} (Stark and
Wessells 2012), and its consequences often lead to increased structural
violence. [The global distribution of the AIDS epidemic, for example, is
determined to a large degree by structural violence and "rape is a major
factor driving the AIDS epidemic]{.underline}" (Mukherjee 2007:117). In
such circumstances, [rape encompasses several kinds of violence, with
roots well established in "peacetime meanings of sexuality]{.underline}"
(Olujic 1998b:33). Similarly, in the context of refugee and IDP
(internally displaced persons) camps, rape may have all of these
connotations and be a manifestation of structural violence, since it
goes largely unreported and is often dismissed by humanitarian
organizations and their staff as an "unfortunate" part of the refugee
context (Whiteford 2009). [This complex relationship between direct and
structural violence was noted]{.underline} over 150 years ago [by German
physician and anthropologist Rudoph Virchow, who wrote that "war, plague
and famine condition each other]{.underline}" (cited in Rather
1985:115). There is ample evidence that war and political violence have
grave impacts on the health and well-being of individuals, communities,
and nations---beyond the immediacy of conflict-induced injury and death
(Geneva Declaration Secretariat 2008; Levy and Sidel 2008; Pedersen
2002; Taipale et al. 2002). Anthropologists, in particular, have shown
that war and conflict not only affect infrastructures supporting local
health care, education, markets, and farming activities, but also
disrupt families and community support systems, damage the environment,
interrupt means of livelihood, and displace populations (Leatherman and
Thomas 2008; Rylko-Bauer and Singer 2010; Rylko-Bauer, Whiteford, and
Farmer 2009; Singer and Hodge 2010). These [impacts are often mediated
by preexisting forms of structural violence which, in the aftermath of
conflict, contribute to even greater levels of poverty, political
marginalization, and racism]{.underline} (Fassin 2009; Miller and
Rasmussen 2010; Nordstrom 2004; Panter-Brick 2010; Quesada 2009).
Moreover, these consequences often have a long half-life (Becker,
Beyene, and Ken 2000; Das 2007; Johnston 2007, 2011; Johnston and Barker
2008). [Women are especially victimized by multiple forms of violence,
which often interact and are shaped by both gendered dimensions of
conflict and preexisting gender discrimination]{.underline} (Annan and
Brier 2010). And children are (p. 54) particularly vulnerable, but the
"costs \[they\] pay for the actions of war and its devastating aftermath
... are often neglected" (Quesada 1998:64--65; see also Kent 2006;
McEvoy-Levy 2001; Nordstrom 2009; Olujic 1998a). [Structural violence,
in turn, contributes in complex ways to the preconditions for explosive
direct violence]{.underline} (Bonnefoy, Burgat, and Menoret 2011;
Rylko-Bauer and Singer 2010; Rylko-Bauer et al. 2009; Singer and Hodge
2010). [Armed conflict is more likely in low to middle-income countries
with slower economic growth, greater gaps in income and resource
distribution, and high rates of poverty, hunger, and poor
health]{.underline} (Krug et al. 2002; Pinstrup-Andersen and Shimokawa
2008; Stewart 2002). Structural violence has even been examined as a
form of genocide (Ahmed 2007; Lewy 2007). Rwanda is a compelling
example. Decades of colonial and imperialist exploitation, coupled with
the construction of ethnic difference, laid the groundwork for the
explosive violence of 1994 (Farmer 2009). Western development aid
ignored structural inequities and human rights violations, thus
contributing to already existing poverty, unequal distribution of land
and resources, social exclusion, and class divisions---so that by "the
1990s, the interaction between structural violence and racism created
the conditions for genocidal manipulation by the elites" (Uvin 1999:54).
Several models have been proposed for exploring how [both direct and
indirect violence serve as precursors to collective physical
violence]{.underline} (De Jong 2010). One example is the notion of [a
continuum of violence]{.underline} (Scheper-Hughes 1996, 2007;
Scheper-Hughes and Bourgois 2004), [based on the recognition that social
tolerance of "everyday" structural violence, and the humiliation that
accompanies it, sets the stage for normalization of more overt and
visible forms, from police brutality and state-directed political
violence to massacres and genocides]{.underline} (Scheper-Hughes 1996;
Uvin 1999). This is particularly applicable to Latin America where there
has been a shift from the brutal political violence of the latter
twentieth century to the more recent growth in criminal and
interpersonal violence (Briceño-León and Zubillaga 2002; Sanchez 2006).
These rates correlate with lower levels of development and higher income
inequality within the region (Bliss 2010; United Nations Office on Drugs
and Crime 2011). While conventional analyses link these trends to drug
trafficking, gang membership, readily available firearms, and a weak
criminal justice system (World Bank 2011), a number of anthropologists
see a deeper link with the past (Bourgois 2001; Heggenhougen 2009; Manz
2009; Metz, Mariano, and García 2010), a "continuum of violence spanning
the civil war years to the present ... \[the\] outcome of a history of
structural violence, gender norms, and political repression" as well as
racism directed against indigenous populations (Bourgois 2009:36).
Layered upon this legacy of political violence is the more recent
"structural violence \[of\] rampant economic inequality, social
exclusion, and persistent poverty arising from the imposition of
neoliberal economic policies," namely structural adjustment programs
linked to development aid and unfair international trade agreements
(Sanchez 2006:179; Quesada 2009). Similar processes in other parts of
the Global South have exacerbated the poverty, dislocation, and lack of
jobs in the (p. 55) formal economy that serve "as a trigger" for growing
rates of "reactive" social and criminal violence (Winton 2004:166--67).
Understanding Invisible Violence Structural violence is only one among
several forms of less visible violence that are interconnected in
complex ways. Anthropologist Philippe Bourgois (2009) has proposed a
conceptual framework for critically examining how [the invisible
processes of structural, as well as symbolic, and normalized violence
are linked across time and space to various kinds of direct violence. A
central element in all three concepts is the normalization of unequal
power relations. Symbolic violence]{.underline} is associated with
sociologist Pierre Bourdieu (2000) and [refers to sociocultural
mechanisms and relations of unequal power and domination that exist
within interpersonal relationships and in other spheres of
life]{.underline}. It is [embedded in ordinary daily life, manifested
through language, symbolism, and actions that are perceived by both
perpetrator and victim as normal or deserved]{.underline}, a legitimate
and inevitable part of the natural social order. "Symbolic violence is
... so powerful precisely because it is unrecognizable for what it is."
Its power "rests precisely in its lack of visibility---in the fact that
for those exposed to it the doubts and the fear engendered by it cause
them to question themselves" (Morgan and Björkert 2006:448). A classic
example is that of intimate partner violence, where women blame
themselves and are blamed by others for the violence perpetrated against
them. Symbolic violence harms both psychologically and emotionally and
is often used to justify everyday interpersonal and structural violence,
as Simić and Rhodes (2009) demonstrate in their study of street sex
workers in Serbia. Similarly, in his research of Puerto Rican crack
dealers in New York's East Harlem, Bourgois (2003) shows how [structural
and symbolic violence interact and set conditions for the everyday
interpersonal conflicts]{.underline} "that the socially vulnerable
inflict mainly onto themselves (via substance abuse), onto their kin and
friends (through domestic violence and adolescent gang rape), and onto
their neighbors and community" (Bourgois 2001:11). The normalized
violence that Bourgois (2001, 2009) refers to is an adaptation of the
concept of everyday violence initially developed by Scheper-Hughes
(1992) to highlight the extreme poverty and high infant and child
mortality that characterized life in Brazilian shantytowns. She later
applied this concept to life circumstances affecting other socially
marginalized people, such as Brazilian and South African street youth or
the elderly in U.S. nursing homes (Scheper-Hughes 1996, 2007). The
concept of [normalized violence recognizes the indifference in broader
society and identifies mechanisms by which violence becomes an
inevitable part of daily life for its victims]{.underline}. For example,
in his life history of a street drug addict named Tony, Merrill Singer
(2006:72) observes that "the threat of violence---emotional and
physical---daily preparation for violence on the street, and enduring
the agony of violence-inflicted (p. 56) pain were all commonplace to
\[Tony\] as an integral part of the world of street drug use and sales.
He had come to accept violence as he had bad weather, harsh but
unavoidable." Some scholars have called for more detailed and nuanced
analysis. For example, in examining the "routinization of political
violence as a social violence of the everyday" in communist China,
Kleinman (2000:235) concludes that we should pay closer attention to the
"multiplicity of violences of everyday life" across classes of people
and social contexts, each with "different histories, sustained by
different social dynamics," and varied "outcome\[s\]‌ in trauma and
suffering."

### Framing -- Risk-Analysis Bad

#### Shoddy link-chains become the very logic of post-9/11 insecurity---this justifies preemption and becomes the cause of crisis itself.

**Stockdale 16** (Liam, Contract and Sessional Faculty at the Institute
on Globalization & the Human Condition at McMaster University
"Catastrophic Futures, Precarious Presents, and the Temporal Politics of
(In)security" in *Time, Temporality, and Global Politics*, p. 178-179)
NIJ

Looking at this trend from a wider perspective, it can be usefully
understood as a function of broader shifts in the way the present and
future are framed in the contemporary global security imagination. In
this respect, **[the present is construed as beset by a radical
contingency, with the global security environment in particular
characterised by the breakdown of established certainties in the face of
novel threats]{.underline}** (Kessler and Daase 2008). **[The
consequence is that 'decision-makers are simply no longer able to
guarantee predictability, security, and control' to the extent that was
once believed possible]{.underline}** (Aradau and van Munster 2008: 23).
Complementary to this framing of the present, **[the future is
understood in terms not just of radical uncertainty but of 'expected and
undeniable catastrophe', typified by the proverbial next attack, with
the precise moment of its emergence remaining continually
unknown]{.underline}** (Ibid.). In other words, **[the future embodies
an impending catastrophe that is seemingly both inevitable---in that it
will at some point occur---and unknowable---in that we cannot be certain
when it will take place]{.underline}** (Anderson 2010a: 779-80; Opitz
and Tellmann 2015: 107). **[What]{.underline}** more broadly **[results
is]{.underline}** what Paul Virilio has termed **['a culture of the
imminence of disaster']{.underline}** (2010: 7), **[in
which]{.underline}**---to wax Rumsfeldian---**[contemporary life is
haunted by the spectre of a disastrous unknown that is paradoxically
known to be lurking in the future's unknowable depths. Approaches
premised upon taming these uncertainties by controlling the unfolding of
the future through anticipatory interventions in the present have
accordingly come to dominate the post-9/11 global politics of
(in)security.]{.underline}** In practice, **[this perspective implies
the necessity of acting pre-emptively, even without an established base
of verifiable knowledge upon which to make such decisions]{.underline}**
(Aradau and van Munster 2007: 101). In other words, **[radical
uncertainty about both the nature of the threat and the moment at which
it might emerge is not an impediment to acting anticipatorily; it
instead provides the very impetus for it, such that 'the absence of
specific evidence serves as justification for action']{.underline}**
(Elmer and Opel 2006: 481). **[This places governing authorities 'in the
uncomfortable position of having to take drastic action in the face of
an inescapably elusive, uncertain threat']{.underline}** (Cooper 2006:
119).

# Topicality

## Framework

### 2AC

#### Interpretation: the affirmative must defend a reduction of arms sales from the United States. 

#### Foreclosing jurisgenerative means of engagement creates a hermetically sealed echo chamber which internal link turns all of their dialogue imapcts -- instead our interp preserves both ground and clash while also refusing to shut out difference 

**Berman 2013** (Paul Schiff Berman, George Washington University Law
School, \"Jurisgenerative Constitutionalism: Procedural Principles for
Managing Global Legal Pluralism\", Indiana Journal of Global Legal
Studies Vol. 20, Issue 2 (2013),
<https://scholarship.law.gwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2228&context=faculty_publications>,
mmv)

**[Once we take Global Legal Pluralism as our framework for analysis, we
are better able to imagine procedural mechanisms, institutional designs,
and discursive practices that are better suited to a reality of legal
hybrids and overlaps]{.underline}**. These **[principles can be thought
of as constitutional because they address the fundamental constitutive
terms under which multiple communities interact]{.underline}**. In this
essay, I have outlined both the constitutional principles that a
pluralist approach calls forth as well as several examples of pluralist
mechanisms already in existence. **[A constitutional pluralist
jurisprudence of hybridity does not, of course, make it any easier to
reach actual decisions in individual cases]{.underline}**. Indeed,
**[determining when to defer to a foreign norm and when not, when to
allow a margin of appreciation and when not, when to carve out zones of
autonomy and when to encroach on them: these are all issues that are
probably impossible ever to resolve satisfactorily. And I do not suggest
that merely adopting a more inclusive set of jurisprudential or
institutional mechanisms will eliminate clashes among normative
communities]{.underline}**. **[Such clashes are both inevitable and
unlikely ever to be dissolved. But the relevant question]{.underline}**,
it seems to me, **[is not whether law can eliminate conflict, but
whether it has a chance of mediating disputes among multiple
communities]{.underline}**. And this question becomes increasingly
important as normative communities increasingly overlap and intersect.
Accordingly, **[instead of bemoaning the messiness of jurisdictional
overlaps, we should accept them as a necessary consequence of the fact
that communities cannot be hermetically sealed off from each
other]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[we can go further and consider the
possibility that this jurisdictional messiness might, in the end,
provide important systemic benefits by fostering dialogue among multiple
constituencies, authorities, levels of government, and nonstate
communities]{.underline}**. In addition, **[jurisdictional redundancy
allows alternative ports of entry for strategic actors who might
otherwise be silenced]{.underline}**. Most fundamentally, **[all of this
interaction is elided or ignored if we continue to think and speak as if
legal and quasi-legal spheres can be formally differentiated from each
other or as if we will one day all be able to live under a single
overarching legal system]{.underline}**. Instead, **[we need to accept
and perhaps even celebrate the potentially jurisgenerative and creative
role law might play in a plural world. Indeed, it is only if we take
multiple affiliation seriously, if we seek dialogue across difference,
and if we accept unassimilated otherness that we will have some hope of
navigating the hybrid legal spaces that are all around
us]{.underline}**.

## T Proper

### Arms

#### Strict definitions of arms are incomplete and don't describe the bigger picture -- overlapping definitions 

**Holtom and Bromley 2010** (Paul Holtom is director of the arms
transfers program at the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute. Mark Bromley is a researcher in the same program, \"The
International Arms Trade: Difficult to Define, Measure, and Control\",
Arms Control Association,
<https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2010_07-08/holtom-bromley>, mmv)

For several reasons, there is no straightforward answer to the question,
"How big is the international arms trade?" First, **[there is no
globally agreed definition of "arms." States and international
organizations that seek to measure or control the arms trade use lists
of items that vary in their complexity and coverage, most notably with
regard to their inclusion of "dual-use goods,"]{.underline}** items with
both military and civilian applications.\[1\] **[Second, there is no
common agreement on what types of activities constitute the arms
trade]{.underline}**. Examples of areas where differences exist include
arms leased to other states; gifts and donations; the transfer of
technology to produce arms and military equipment; and upgrades, parts,
and services related to the transfer of arms and military equipment.
**[Third, the lack of openness and transparency by many arms suppliers
and recipients regarding the value and volume of their arms exports and
imports makes it difficult to collect accurate data]{.underline}**. As a
result, a variety of different definitions of the international arms
trade and estimates of its scale exists. This has implications for
efforts to establish controls on arms transfers via a future
international arms trade treaty (ATT). This article will outline some of
the challenges in defining, measuring, and controlling the international
arms trade.

### FMS/DCS

#### Security assistance is FMS -- done through the DOD with a foreign government 

**Hays 2016** (Laurie Hays, international trade specialist on the
Aerospace Team in the U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade
Administration. A note of thanks goes out to Kim Wells, Aerospace Team
Leader, and Scott Kennedy, Director of the Office of Transportation and

Promotion and Resource Guidelines\", December 2016,
<https://www.trade.gov/td/otm/assets/aero/DefHB_FULL.pdf>, mmv)

1\) The Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Program: **[FMS is a form of
security assistance authorized by the Arms Export Control Act
(AECA)]{.underline}** and is a fundamental tool of U.S. foreign policy
in support of U.S. national security and defense objectives. **[The
Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) administers the FMS program
for the United States' Department of Defense (DOD).]{.underline}**
Exporters should review the official DSCA Customer Guide for a more
detailed summary of the FMS process. FMS sales are concluded when the
President formally determines that the sale will strengthen U.S.
national security and promote world peace. **[In FMS sales, the foreign
government purchaser does not deal directly with the manufacturer.
Instead, the foreign purchaser contracts with DOD]{.underline}**, who
then handles procurement, logistics, delivery, and often provides
product support, training, and other infrastructure or technical
support. **[DOD provides a "total package" approach to ensure that
foreign purchases include the full range or support and training
required to operate and sustain the new capability]{.underline}**.
**[Sales are implemented through contractlike agreements called Letters
of Offer and Acceptance (LOAs) between the U.S. Government and an
eligible foreign government purchaser]{.underline}**.

#### Arms include any police and military mechanisms -- no functional difference in function and design 

**ORF 2017** (Omega Research Foundation, UK registered charity in
consultative status with UN ECOSOC, and with over 20 years' experience

Arms Transfers on Human Rights.\", May 3 2017,
<https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/RuleOfLaw/ArmsTransfers/OmegaResearchFoundation.pdf>,
mmv)

**[We submit that a comprehensive definition of 'arms' should include
police as well as military weapons. This would include, not only police
small arms that fire lethal ammunition but also, for example, riot
launchers and ammunition of all kinds, including 'tear gas' grenades and
cartridge launched projectiles, kinetic impact
projectiles]{.underline}** (such as rubber coated steel bullets, plastic
baton rounds and solid rubber baton rounds), **[projectile electrical
weapons,]{.underline}** (such as 'Taser' weapons made by American
company Taser International), **[directed energy weapons]{.underline}**
(such as acoustic weapons, millimetre wave weapons and laser dazzlers),
**[shotgun fired birdshot and buckshot, and water cannon and other riot
control type vehicles -- technologies often referred to as 'less-lethal'
but which can impact human rights, including the right to life, in
various ways. Whilst these less lethal technologies might appear a
diverse group, they all act in various ways to direct energy or matter
to one or more targets, with a range of intended and unintended
outcomes]{.underline}** 2.

### Reduce 

#### Reduce means to diminish to a smaller number

**Oxford English Dictionary 89** (online, at Emory)

**[reduce]{.underline}**, *v.*

**26. a.** **[To bring down, diminish to a smaller
number]{.underline}**, amount, extent, etc., or *to* a single thing.

# A2: Amend CP

## A2: Solvency

### No Solvency -- Refuse to Trace

#### Amendment doesn't solve -- It's not a question of legal trappings, the US lacks the political will to enforce any checks on Israel.

**Kane 19** (Alex, Journalist for In These Times "Inside Sources Say the
State Dept Refuses To Trace Whether Israel Is Using U.S. Military Aid
Illegally"
<http://inthesetimes.com/features/israel-palestine-killings-us-aid-military-weapons.html>)
NIJ

It's not supposed to be this way. U.S. arms exports to Israel (and other
countries) are governed by laws placing restrictions on sales to nations
that abuse human rights. **[Campaigns to cut U.S. military aid to Israel
have latched onto a particular measure, known as the Leahy Law. The law
prohibits U.S. assistance or training from flowing to foreign military
units that have committed a gross violation of human rights, unless the
foreign government has held that unit accountable. But interviews with
human rights advocates, congressional aides and former and current U.S.
officials reveal that enforcement of the Leahy Law in Israel is lax,
with no tracking of which army units receive U.S. weapons. Human rights
advocates say they have brought the State Department evidence of
specific crimes committed by soldiers who clearly used U.S. weapons,
only to have that evidence brushed off.]{.underline}** A current U.S.
official, who asked for anonymity because they are not authorized to
speak to the press and could be fired as a result, told In These Times
that they are not aware of any time when an Israeli unit was cut off
from U.S. assistance under the Leahy Law. **[This lack of enforcement
allows Israel to get away with extrajudicial executions of
Palestinians]{.underline}**, human rights advocates say. Maria LaHood,
deputy legal director at the Center for Constitutional Rights, says
**[the United States' "unparalleled support for Israel" gives it
leverage to end these extrajudicial killings if it chooses. "Our
government does not lack the legal tools to put an end to Israel's human
rights violations,"]{.underline}** she says. **["It lacks the political
will."]{.underline}**

### A2: Solves Stability

#### Arms sales to Israel paves the way for Israeli weapons exports -- causes ME instability

**BADILLIO 19**-research analyst at Canadians for Justice and Peace in
the Middle East based in Montreal, Quebec. She holds an M.Phil from
Trinity College Dublin, in International Peace Studies. Anna is a social
justice activist and human rights advocate with a focuses on
Palestinian-Israeli affairs and international law \[Anna, "The US-Israel
'special relationship' subsidizes American military industry and Israeli
colonialism,"
4/9/2019, <https://thedefensepost.com/2019/04/09/us-israel-arms-sales-opinion/,> DKP\]

By the 2000s, the Israeli military-industrial complex had produced an
industry capable of competing in small-arms and high-end security
technology on a worldwide scale. Israel started to export arms that have
been refined through high-technology colonial policing of the
Palestinian population, especially in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
**[In recent years, Israel has risen to one of the top 10 arms exporters
in the world.]{.underline}** Last May Haaretz reported, **["Israel's
defense-related exports in 2017 totalled \$9.2 billion, an all-time
record and whooping 40% increase over 2016 -- when defense-related
transactions totaled \$6.5 billion." The Obama administration
adjustments to Israel's military aid package came amidst a shifting
geopolitical environment, both within the U.S. and Israel. There was a
shift in original MOU that would slowly phase out the provisions through
which Israel could spend up to 26% of its funding package within Israel,
to Israel spending more of this funding on the advanced military
capabilities that only the United States can provide -- as much as \$1.2
billion per year]{.underline}**, according to Ajl. In addition, **[this
MOU locked in \$500 million annually for missile defense. The MOU
mandates Israel update its fighter aircraft fleet, which is a direct
investment into the U.S. military-industrial complex, given that
fighter-jet factories are exclusively based in the United
States.]{.underline}** Not only does U.S. foreign policy and
Israeli-settler colonialism shape what happens across historic
Palestine, it also shapes what happens across the Middle East region.
**[The firm establishment of Israel's military defense industry also
provides an excuse to sell ever-more-sophisticated weapons to other
regional U.S. allies, especially Saudi Arabia. As long as Israel has the
latest U.S. technology, other countries can buy older models, again to
the great profit of the U.S. defense industry. Israel thus is the spark
plug for an entire region-wide weapons bazaar, while also providing such
countries the means to destroy and dismantle even poorer countries like
Yemen. This keeps the entire region aflame]{.underline}**, oppressed and
desperate, and thus unlikely to upset hierarchical regional and
international social structures. Ajl suggests that one of reasons the
United States pushed through this MOU before Obama left office is the
rising discontent within the U.S. population over ongoing support for
Israeli colonization of historic Palestine and the surrounding region.

# A2: Israel Strikes

## A2: Links

### No Link

#### No link and turn -- US military aid does not seem to affect military anxiety among Israeli leadership about Iran's nuclear program. If Israel was going to launch a first strike, it would likely be with US equipment. 

**Bachar 17** \[Ariel, "JCPOA: Implications and Effects on Our Current
Military Sales Program." Public Contract Law Journal, Vol 46, Iss. 4,
Summer 2017 //tjb\]

**[Israel\'s heightened concerns due to JCPOA also increases the
possibility it will strike or attack Iran using U.S. equipment and
technology.]{.underline}**161 **[Regardless of how much aid the United
States provides Israel, \"it will still never be enough to safeguard
against \[an Iranian\] nuclear attack.\"]{.underline}**162 **[In the
past, Israel has been wary of its regional rivals\' pursuit of nuclear
capabilities because nuclear weapons pose a mortal threat to the Jewish
state.]{.underline}**163 Israel has shown a willingness to address
threats by \"us\[ing\] force to protect nationals abroad, tak\[ing\]
anticipatory self-defense, and respond\[ing\] to terrorism as part of
self-defense.\"164 In 1985, Israel carried out an attack against the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) headquarters in Tunisia using
U.S.-supplied aircrafts.165 **[Israel also shows a willingness to use
force to specifically address nuclear threats.]{.underline}** As
previously mentioned, in 1981, Israel attacked an Iraqi nuclear reactor
using U.S.- made F-15 and F-16 planes.166 In addition, Israel carried
out an airstrike against a Syrian facility in 2007, which it identified
as a nuclear reactor.167

### No Link -- Trump Withdrawal

#### Trump's withdrawal from the Iran deal assured Netanyahu of US security commitments -- the plan will not trigger the link. 

**Landler 18** \[Mark Landler is a white house correspondent at the New
York Times. "Trump Abandons Iran Nuclear Deal He Long Scorned." The New

WASHINGTON --- **[President Trump declared on Tuesday that he was
withdrawing from the
[Iran](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-revolutionary-guard-corps.html?module=inline)
nuclear deal]{.underline}**, unraveling the signature foreign policy
achievement of his predecessor Barack Obama, isolating the United States
from its Western allies and sowing uncertainty before a risky nuclear
negotiation with North Korea. The decision, while long anticipated and
widely telegraphed, leaves the [2015
agreement](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-is-reached-after-long-negotiations.html?module=inline)
reached by seven countries after more than two years of grueling
negotiations in tatters. **[The United States will now reimpose the
stringent sanctions it imposed on Iran before the deal and is
considering new penalties.
[Iran](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-revolutionary-guard-corps.html?module=inline)
said it will remain in the deal, which tightly restricted its nuclear
ambitions for a decade or more in return for ending the sanctions that
had crippled its economy.]{.underline}** So did France, Germany and
Britain, raising the prospect of a trans-Atlantic clash as European
companies face the return of American sanctions for doing business with
Iran. China and Russia, also signatories to the deal, are likely to join
Iran in accusing the United States of violating the accord. Mr. Trump's
move could embolden hard-line forces in Iran, raising the threat of
Iranian retaliation against Israel or the United States, fueling an arms
race in the Middle East and fanning sectarian conflicts from Syria to
Yemen. **[The president, however, framed his decision as the fulfillment
of a bedrock campaign promise and as the act of a dealmaker dissolving a
fatally flawed agreement]{.underline}**. He predicted his tough line
with Iran would strengthen his hand as he prepared to meet North Korea's
leader, Kim Jong-un, to begin negotiating the surrender of his nuclear
arsenal. "This was a horrible one-sided deal that should have never,
ever been made," a grim-faced Mr. Trump said in an 11-minute address
from the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House. "It didn't bring
calm, it didn't bring peace, and it never will." \[Read the full
transcript of [President Trump's
remarks.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/us/politics/trump-speech-iran-deal.html?action=click&module=inline&pgtype=Article)\]
[Mr.
Trump's](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-revolutionary-guard-corps.html?module=inline)
announcement drew a chorus of opposition from European leaders, several
of whom lobbied him feverishly not to pull out of the agreement and
searched for fixes to it that would satisfy him. It also drew a rare
public rebuke by Mr. Obama, who said Mr. Trump's withdrawal would leave
the world less safe, confronting it with "a losing choice between a
nuclear-armed Iran or another war in the Middle East." The response from
Iran itself, however, was muted. **[President Hassan Rouhani declared
that the Iranians intended to abide by the terms of the deal, and he
criticized Mr. Trump for his history of not honoring international
treaties. Mr. Trump won strong backing from Saudi Arabia and Israel,
whose leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, hailed him for a
"historic move" and "courageous leadership."]{.underline}**

## A2: Impacts

### Aff Solves

#### The link does not assume the plan -- if Israel were to strike Iran, it would do so using US equipment. Aff solves the link.

**Bachar 17** \[Ariel, "JCPOA: Implications and Effects on Our Current
Military Sales Program." Public Contract Law Journal, Vol 46, Iss. 4,
Summer 2017 //tjb\]

In the past, Israeli officials considered strikes against the Iranian
nuclear program to neutralize a perceived threat to Israel\'s
existence.12 **[Although most Israeli analysts believe that JCPOA takes
a deliberate attack on Iran\'s nuclear facilities offthe table, future
military conflict remains a possibility.]{.underline}**13 **[An Israeli
attack on Iran could involve U.S. equipment or technology, given the
large amount Israel acquires through the FMS program.]{.underline}**14
**[The United States might then be faced with determining: (1) whether
the attack violates the conditions of the FMS program; and (2) if so,
whether to suspend or terminate Israel\'s participation in the
program.]{.underline}**15 A restriction on Israel\'s participation in
the FMS program may contradict current legislation committing the United
States to annually provide Israel with aid, thus helping Israel to
maintain a qualitative military edge in the Middle East.16 Additionally,
it might negatively impact the U.S. defense industry, costing defense
contractors one of their largest consumers and creating long-term profit
loss.17 **[Conversely, failing to take action against Israel for its
potential questionable conduct can lead to both public scrutiny and
litigation against the U.S. government and defense
contractors.]{.underline}**

### No Middle East War

#### Conflicts will occur in the Middle East, but they [will not escalate]{.underline} because of changed attitudes, collective security institutions, and [international cooperation]{.underline}

**Evans 14** -- Richard Evans, regius professor of history at the
University of Cambridge and president of Wolfson College, Cambridge,
Ph.D. from Oxford, previously taught at the University of Stirling,
University of East Anglia and Birkbeck College, 2014 ("What Can 1914
Tell Us About 2014?" *New Republic*, January 26^th^,
<http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116347/what-pre-world-war-i-europe-can-tell-us-about-today>)

**[The Balkan states, much like nations of the Middle East today, to a
degree stood proxy for larger powers]{.underline}**, notably tsarist
Russia, Germany and Austria-Hungary. They had come close to the brink
during the first Balkan war in 1912-13, when Montenegro in alliance with
Serbia attacked northern Albania, where there were virtually no Serbs or
Montenegrins among the inhabitants. Austria-Hungary demanded Serbia's
with­drawal, Russia began to mobilise in support of the Serbs, and France
declared its support for the Russians. The situation was defused only by
a British intervention, resulting in an international conference that
guaranteed independence for Albania. The whole episode was an ominous
foretaste of what happened in August 1914. With the break-up of the
alliance of the Balkan states in 1913, Bulgaria went over to the
patronage of the Germans, while Russia's only client left in the region
was Serbia. Serbian ambitions had already prompted Austria-Hungary to
annex Bosnia and Herzegovina, with their substantial population of
Serbs, in 1908. It would be just as wrong to dismiss all of this as
irrelevant to the ambitions and rivalries of the Great Powers, as Boris
Johnson has done recently, as it would be to dismiss the violent
antagonisms in today's Middle East as unimportant to international
relations on a wider scale. And yet the Balkan nations in the late 19th
and early 20th centuries were no more mere puppets of Germany or Russia
than the Middle Eastern states of today are puppets of America, Russia
or China. As President Obama has discovered, trying to control Israeli
governments is no easy task; he might tell the Israelis not to build any
new Jewish settlements on the occupied West Bank but they carry on
regardless. **[China and Russia might block western attempts to impose
sanctions on the Assad regime in Syria and may continue supplying it
with arms]{.underline}**, but they have not been able to control it or
stop its opponents, so they have become willing to explore ways of
ending the conflict peaceably; their co-operation in the removal of
chemical weapons signals their refusal to back the regime all the way.
**[China supplies Iran with weapons and with nuclear technology but can
do little to mediate its policy in the Middle East, and its approach is
tempered by the need to keep up good relations with the United
States]{.underline}**. Not least because of the growing importance of
economic ties with the west, Russia has bowed to international pressure
for sanctions on Iran and has curbed its arms supplies to the country.
**[In all of this, there are few indications]{.underline}** **[that the
world's great powers today are being drawn into regional conflicts as
closely as they were in 1914]{.underline}**. **[One important reason for
this lies in our changed attitudes to war]{.underline}**. **[In Europe,
the wars of the 19th century were limited in duration and scope, and
seldom involved more than a handful of combatant nations]{.underline}**.
All told, deaths in battle between 1815 and 1914 were seven times fewer
than combat deaths in the previous century. The wars of German
unification in the 1860s, the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-78 and similar
conflicts were swiftly resolved by decisive victories for one side or
the other. Even the Crimean war of 1854-56 did not move much beyond the
hinterland of the Black Sea. In the 19th century fear of the upheaval
and destruction caused by the French revolutionary and Napoleonic wars
brought the leading European states together time and again in what was
known as the Concert of Europe to resolve potential conflicts through
international conferences. Though it was severely damaged in the 1850s
and 1860s, the Concert was patched together again in the 1870s, when the
Congress of Berlin redrew the map of the Balkans, while another Berlin
conference sorted out colonial rivalries (without, needless to say,
consulting any of the millions of people about to be colonised) in 1884.
These **[institutions, like the United Nations of today, provided a
forum in which diplomats and statesmen could work together to avoid war,
and they largely succeeded]{.underline}**. **[If there is no sign that
the UN]{.underline}**, for all its inadequacies, **[is about to
collapse]{.underline}**, **[it is not least because the postwar
settlement]{.underline}** of 1945 **[rested on a general recognition
that]{.underline}** **[international co-operation]{.underline}** **[in
all fields had to be stronger than it was under the League of
Nations]{.underline}**, the UN's ill-fated predecessor. The destruction
caused by the Second World War, with its 50 million or more dead, its
ruined cities, its genocides, its widespread negation of civilised
values, had a far more powerful effect than the deaths caused by the
First World War, which were (with exceptions, notably the genocide of a
million or more Armenian civilians, killed by the Turks in 1915) largely
confined to troops on active service. In 1945, Hiroshima and Nagasaki
provided an additional, ter­rible warning of what would happen if the
world went to war again.

#### Institutions and [deterrence]{.underline} prevent escalation

**Lubin 14** -- Gus Lubin, editor-in-chief of Tech Insider, citing
Richard Evans, regius professor of history at the University of
Cambridge and president of Wolfson College, Cambridge, Ph.D. from
Oxford, and Joseph Nye, Distinguished Service Professor at the Harvard
Kennedy School of Government, PhD in political science from Harvard,
former Dean of the Harvard\'s Kennedy School of Government, 2014 ("Why
Today Is Different From The 1914 Outbreak Of World War I," *Business
Insider*, July 26^th^,
<http://www.businessinsider.com/differences-between-now-and-1914-outbreak-of-wwi-2014-7>)

**[With the world caught in a series of potential proxy wars
from]{.underline}** Ukraine to **[the Middle East]{.underline}** and
tensions ratcheting in East Asia and elsewhere, **[many have compared
the present to 1914]{.underline}**, when a trigger event in Sarajevo
activated military alliances and led to a devastating global war.
Especially on the 100-year anniversary of the start of World War I, the
similarities come to mind easily, but **[is history really
repeating?]{.underline}** **[Richard Evans]{.underline}**, the Regius
Professor of History at Cambridge, **[identified key
difference]{.underline}** **[between now and then in a January article
in the New Statesman]{.underline}**. **[These include balancing
tendencies of the multipolar world we live in now as well as the
emergence of \"institutions of collective security\"]{.underline}** like
the United Nations, which makes a big difference even if they may seem
ineffective. Above all, he believes people have learned from history, as
he said in an interview with the New Republic: I think the major
difference now is that we've had two World Wars, and we've had the
nuclear age. Whereas in 1914, states, and for that matter most of the
public in most nations, had what we now think of as a very irresponsible
attitude toward war. They went into it in a gung-ho way. Now I think
**[we are much more afraid of a major war, and we are much more cautious
about it]{.underline}**. I think the attitude of politicians today is
very different from what it was in 1914. As for WWI not preventing WWII,
many see the latter as an extension of the former, and anyway WWII had a
greater effect. Writes Evans: The destruction caused by the Second World
War, with its 50 million or more dead, its ruined cities, its genocides,
its widespread negation of civilised values, had a far more powerful
effect than the deaths caused by the First World War, which were (with
exceptions, notably the genocide of a million or more Armenian
civilians, killed by the Turks in 1915) largely confined to troops on
active service. In 1945, Hiroshima and Nagasaki provided an additional,
ter­rible warning of what would happen if the world went to war again.
**[Harvard Professor Joseph S. Nye]{.underline}**, Jr. similarly
**[commented]{.underline}** on changing attitudes toward war in a
January article: **[Today\'s world is different from the world of
1914]{.underline}** in several important ways. One is that **[nuclear
weapons give political leaders the equivalent of a crystal ball that
shows what their world would look like after escalation]{.underline}**.
Perhaps if the Emperor, the Kaiser, and the Czar had had a crystal ball
showing their empires destroyed and their thrones lost in 1918, they
would have been more prudent in 1914. Certainly, the crystal-ball effect
had a strong influence on US and Soviet leaders during the Cuban missile
crisis. It would likely have a similar influence on US and Chinese
leaders today. **[Another difference is that the ideology of war is much
weaker nowadays]{.underline}**. In 1914, war really was thought to be
inevitable, a fatalistic view reinforced by the Social Darwinist
argument that war should be welcomed, because it would \"clear the air\"
like a good summer storm.

### No Strikes -- No Iran Aggression

#### Deterrence checks -- Iran won't escalate in aggression despite inflammatory rhetoric.

**Wright 10** (Parker, Intelligence Officer in the United States Air
Force and Masters in Public Policy from Harvard "Bombs and Umbrellas:
Defending US Middle East Allies from a Nuclear-Armed Iran") NIJ

**[Some question, given the nature of the regime, whether or not Iran
can be deterred. They question the rationality of Supreme Leader
Khomenei and President Ahmadenejad.]{.underline}** However, Robert
Jervis assures us that, "**[Much less than total rationality is needed
for the main lines of \[deterrence\] theory to be
valid."]{.underline}**27 In fact, **["Rationality may be neither
necessary nor sufficient for deterrence."]{.underline}**28 Patrick
Morgan offers an alternative formulation: **["Deterrence rests less on
the capacities of men for rationality than on their ability to be
conscious of their limitations and adjust their behavior
accordingly.]{.underline}**"29 **[An adversary must be capable of
"sensible" decision making, not necessarily rational decision making.
But are Iran‟s leaders sensible? Many observers are concerned about
religious fanaticism.]{.underline}** Ahmadenejad routinely interweaves
mysticism into his public pronouncements on Iran‟s nuclear program. Of
concern is Shia Islam‟s belief in the "Hidden Imam," also referred to as
al Mahdi. In contrast to Sunni Muslims, Shiites believe the legitimate
heirs to Mohammed are direct descendants from the Prophet. Most Shiites
believe there have been eleven rightful successors, the Twelfth Imam
having entered a period of occultation in 874 AD only to return on the
Day of Judgment. The Mahdi will be called forth to restore justice on
Earth only after a period of apocalyptic turmoil leaving five out of
every seven people dead. This leads some to suggest that a nuclear armed
Iran would attempt to usher in the return of the Mahdi by igniting a
nuclear conflagration.30 While this line of reasoning cannot be fully
discredited, **[there is nothing in Iranian behavior since the 1979
Revolution to suggest Iran is driven by fanatical religious zealots
intent on destroying the world. Would Iran be willing to risk Tehran to
take out Tel Aviv?]{.underline}** In fact, Ken Waltz observes,
**["Rulers want to have a country that they can continue to
rule."]{.underline}**31 **[Waltz suggests Iran may be self-limiting by
acquiring nuclear weapons, "In a nuclear world, no one can escalate to a
level of force anywhere near the top without risking its own
destruction."]{.underline}**32 Similarly, **["For fear of escalation,
nuclear states do not want to fight long and hard over important
interests--- indeed, they do not want to fight at all."]{.underline}**33
James Lindsay and Ray Takeyh agree, **["Despite their Islamist
compulsions, the mullahs like power too much to be
martyrs."]{.underline}**34 **[They have systematically avoided direct
military confrontation with either the United States or Israel.
Regularly displaying pragmatism, the Iranian regime has worked to
balance the tensions between their revolutionary ideals and their
governing responsibilities. Iran has challenged the US presence in both
Iraq and Afghanistan but has done so in a way that avoids
escalation.]{.underline}** At times, Iran has even supported US policy
objectives in both countries when their national interests aligned. It
is difficult to look past the bellicose rhetoric, especially if you are
Israel, but **[the Iranian government‟s actions have fallen well within
the "sensible" range. There is nothing then to suggest Tehran is immune
to traditional statecraft.]{.underline}**

### No Strikes -- Isolation

#### No Israeli attack -- international isolation more threatening than Iran 

**Tarnopolsky 15** (Noga -- journalist for Reuters. She has two decades
of experience covering international politics. "Israel won\'t strike
Iran alone, no matter how much it hates the nuclear deal." Reuters. July
16^th^ 2015. <http://www.trust.org/item/20150716200538-sujfm>)

[Israeli officials]{.underline} across the political landscape [decried
the \"very bad deal]{.underline},\" as Netanyahu termed the agreement,
which the United States and five world powers hope will curb Iran\'s
weaponization of its nuclear program. [But no one]{.underline}, not even
the prime minister, [rattled the sabers of war.]{.underline} \"[An
Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear sites is no longer a relevant
scenario]{.underline},\" wrote Amos Harel, military analyst for the
Israeli daily Haaretz. Once the agreement was announced late Tuesday
night, Netanyahu\'s first, brief statement ignored the nuclear issue
entirely and asserted that \"the world is a much more dangerous place
today than it was yesterday.\" \"The leading international powers have
bet our collective future on a deal with the foremost sponsor of
international terrorism,\" the statement said. \"They\'ve gambled that
in 10 years\' time, Iran\'s terrorist regime will change while removing
any incentive for it to do so.\" It was not a frivolous sentiment for
the leader of a small state on permanent war alert with two of Iran\'s
ruthless proxies, Hezbollah and Hamas, on its northern and southern
borders. In an interview with the New York Times a few hours later,
President Barack Obama responded soberly (if testily) to the charge.
\"What\'s been striking to me is that increasingly the critics are
shifting off the nuclear issue, and they\'re moving into, \'Well,\'\"
the president said, slipping into his opponents\' characters, \"\'even
if the nuclear issue is dealt with, they\'re still going to be
sponsoring terrorism and they\'re still going to get the sanctions
relief and so they\'re going to have more money to engage in these bad
activities.\'\" \"That is a possibility,\" the president acknowledged.
\"And we are going to have to systematically guard against that and work
with our allies, the Gulf countries, Israel, to stop the work that they
are doing outside of the nuclear program.\" The difference in
perspective is essential. If Iran represents a challenge - and,
possibly, a future nuclear power - to the United States, for Israel,
Iran is an implacable foe that strikes on every level and on every
platform, from its flagship nuclear program to its support of Mideast
Islamist groups, from cyber warfare to its sponsorship of attacks
against Israeli targets worldwide. Israel views the sanctions that have
crippled Iran\'s economy as a force that curtails it on all fronts.
\"Israel is like the little child who is pointing its finger and saying,
\'The king is naked, this agreement is naked!\'\" said Yuval Steinitz,
Israel\'s minister responsible for nuclear affairs. The grim ping pong
between Washington and Jerusalem was so intense that, had relations
between the two allies not already been at a nadir, it would have been
tempting to speculate that the United States and Israel were playing a
coordinated game of good cop, bad cop. The American gambit, made
explicit by the president, is to separate the nuclear issue from all
other \"odious\" Iranian activities and hope for a nuclear-bomb halt for
10 years. In Israeli eyes, those are 10 years in which Iran will invest
in all sorts of odiousness, including, but not limited to, the nuclear.
Iran has two paths to the bomb, Netanyahu told NBC. \"One is if they
keep the deal, and the other is if they cheat on the deal. They can
cheat on the deal because inspections are not instantaneous. In fact,
you don\'t have inspections within 24 hours; you have 24 days before you
can inspect any site that you find suspicious in Iran.\" \"Twenty-four
days. Can you imagine giving a drug dealer 24 days\' notice before you
check the premises? That\'s a lot of time to flush a lot of meth down
the toilet.\" Frank-Walter Steinmeier, [Germany\'s foreign minister,
slammed Netanyahu\'s recalcitrance and defended the deal as
\"responsible]{.underline}.\" He said, \"Israel should also take a
closer look at it and not criticize the agreement in a very coarse
way.\" Worse, [British Foreign Secretary]{.underline} Philip
[Hammond]{.underline}, who will be in Jerusalem on Thursday, [betrayed
his lack of sympathy for Netanyahu\'s hard line: \"The question you have
to ask yourself is what kind of a deal would have been welcomed in Tel
Aviv. The answer,]{.underline} of course, [is that Israel doesn\'t want
any deal with Iran]{.underline}. Israel wants a permanent state of
stand-off, and I don\'t believe that\'s in the interests of the
region.\" The significance of the statement is not principally in its
uncommon public expression of exasperation but in the seemingly offhand
reference to Israel\'s commercial capital. It is almost unheard of for a
representative of an Israeli ally to use Tel Aviv as shorthand for the
state, which claims Jerusalem as its \"eternal, unified capital.\" [The
offense to Israeli sensibilities]{.underline} on the eve of a state
visit [is huge]{.underline}. Why such fury? Netanyahu is reaping the
harvest of the scorn he\'s heaped on the West and his brazen alliance
with Republicans, which culminated in last March\'s controversial
address to Congress in which he railed against this very Iran deal. That
[bad blood is exposing Israel to a risk that is no less significant than
that posed by Iran: **the danger of international
isolation**]{.underline}. Harel, the military analyst, estimates that
\"the serious crisis in U.S.-Israeli relations, at whose lies the tense
relationship between Obama and Netanyahu, has produced a situation in
which the prime minister\'s influence over the nuclear talks\' final
stages was marginal.\" [Israel\'s response to the threat posed by
Iran\'s new stature,]{.underline} he concludes, [**\"**depends on
achieving closer ties with the United States.\"]{.underline}

### No Strikes -- Iran Not a Threat

#### The Israeli military doesn't consider Iran a threat.

**Keck 15** -- (5/28, Zachary, Managing Editor at The National Interest,
"Israeli Military: Iran Is Not Most Dangerous Threat,"
http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/israels-military-iran-not-most-dangerous-threat-12989)

**[Israel's military doesn't consider Iran to be the greatest threat to
the Jewish state]{.underline}**, according to a new report. Earlier this
week, the Jewish weekly, **[Forward, reported that the "Israel's
military General Staff and intelligence services are in the midst of a
series of formal discussions" about the major threats facing the
country. According to the report]{.underline}**, **[the
discussions]{.underline}**--- which are being "chaired by the deputy
chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, Major General Yair Golan,
under the supervision of the chief of staff, Lieutenant General Gadi
Eizenkot"---**[are not focusing on a nuclear Iran]{.underline}**.
"**[What most concerns the military in the short range is the likelihood
of renewed flare-ups]{.underline}** within the next few years with the
heavily armed Islamist militias **[on Israel's northern and southern
borders, Hezbollah and Hamas]{.underline}**," the report, which is by
former Forward editor-in-chief J.J. Goldberg, says. As a result,
**[Eizenkot, who]{.underline}** only **[recently took over the reigns of
the IDF, "is trying to direct every possible resource toward
reorganization, reinforcement and intensified training of the army's
ground forces,]{.underline}**" who would be tasked with most of the
fighting in a war with Hezbollah or Hamas.

### No Strikes -- Bluffing

#### No strike -- it's just bluffing to extract concessions.

**Porter 15** -- (Gareth Porter, PhD, former professor of international
studies at City College of New York and American University, former
Academic Director for Peace and Conflict Resolution in the Washington
Semester program at American University, "How Close Was Israel to
Bombing Iran?" TruthOut.org, August 31, 2015,
http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/32573-how-close-was-israel-to-bombing-iran)

**[New evidence has]{.underline}** now **[surfaced from]{.underline}**
former Israeli Defense Minister **[Ehud Barak that Israel came close to
attacking Iran three times over the past few years - if you believe what
\"[major](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/22/middleeast/israel-plan-iran-military-target-strike/)\"
[news
media](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/22/world/middleeast/israel-came-close-to-attacking-iran-ex-defense-minister-says.html)
reported about the story. But you shouldn\'t believe it. The latest
story is only a continuation of the clever ploy that has been carried
out by Israeli administrations from Ehud Olmert to Benjamin Netanyahu to
convince the world that it was seriously contemplating war against Iran
in order to pressure them toward crippling sanctions against Iran, if
not military confrontation with it.]{.underline}** And **[there is even
very strong circumstantial evidence that the Obama administration was
consciously playing its part in a \"good cop/bad cop routine\" with the
Israelis over the ostensible Israeli war threat until early 2012 to
influence other states\' Iran policies and gain political leverage on
Iran]{.underline}**. The latest episode in the seemingly endless story
of Israel\'s threat of war followed the broadcast in Israel of
interviews by Barak for a new biography. The New York Times\'[Jodi
Rudoren
reported](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/22/world/middleeast/israel-came-close-to-attacking-iran-ex-defense-minister-says.html)
that, in those interviews, Barak revealed new details to his biographers
about how close Israel came to striking Iran. **[Barak said that he and
Netanyahu were ready to attack Iran each year, but claimed that
something always went wrong]{.underline}**. Barak referred to three
distinct episodes from 2010 through 2012 in which the he and Netanyahu
were supposedly maneuvering to bring about an air attack on Iran\'s
nuclear program. **[But a closer look at Barak\'s claims shows that in
reality neither Barak nor Netanyahu was really ready to go to war
against Iran]{.underline}**. One of the episodes occurred in 2010 when
**[Netanyahu ordered the Israeli army to put Israeli forces on the
highest possible state of alert reserved for preparation for actual war,
only to be frustrated by the refusal of Israeli army chief of staff
Ashkenazi to the order]{.underline}**. But **[an Israeli television
program on the episode aired in a television special in 2012
\"[suggested](http://www.ipsnews.net/2012/11/netanyahus-2010-order-was-not-a-move-to-war-on-iran/)\"
that the order was not intended as a prelude to war. Although the
television account was not allowed to give the date of the episode, it
is consistent with what happened on May 17, 2010, when Turkish Prime
Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Da
Silva reached an agreement with Iran on a \"fuel swap\" deal. Netanyahu
regarded [the
agreement](http://www.jpost.com/Iranian-Threat/News/Govt-rejects-Iran-deal-as-a-ruse)
as a maneuver to derail a new UN Security Council agreement on
sanctions, but the government issued no public statement that
day]{.underline}**. **[Barak denied on the Israeli program that he and
Netanyahu had intended to go through with an actual attack, which
implied that it was to be a short-term bluff to ensure that the
sanctions agreement would go through]{.underline}**. Ashkenazi\'s
opposition to the order was not that it was intended to take Israel into
war, but that it could easily provoke a military response from Iran.
**[Both Barak and Ashkenazi agreed on the program, and moreover, that
the Israeli army lacked the capability to carry out a successful strike
against Iran without US involvement]{.underline}**. **[That agreement
reflected a broad consensus within the Israeli security elite that
Israel could not carry out a successful operation against Iran without
the full involvement of the United States]{.underline}**. Nevertheless,
**[that elite believed that the threat was necessary to pressure the
rest of the world to act on Iran]{.underline}**. As Yossi
**[Alpher]{.underline}**, a **[former aide to Barak, told
me]{.underline}** in 2012, **[most retired national security officials
were totally opposed to an attack on Iran, but they remained silent
because they did want to \"spoil Bibi\'s successful
bluster.\"]{.underline}** A second episode to which Barak refers to in
his interviews involves his demanding that the United States postpone
the joint military exercise planned for spring 2012, which he now says
he did in order to be able to order an attack on Iran during that period
without implicating the United States in the decision. **[But the
postponement was announced in mid-January 2012, in plenty of time for
Barak to plan the strike against Iran - if that is indeed what he and
Netanyahu had intended. Instead, it didn\'t happen, and Barak offers no
real explanation, commenting that they were \"still unable to find the
right moment.\" The Obama administration pretended to be alarmed about
Netanyahu\'s readiness to attack]{.underline}**. But **[Obama was
actually playing along with the Israeli strategy in order to line up
support for a more aggressive regime of sanctions and then to put
pressure on Iran to enter into negotiations aimed at closing down its
enrichment program]{.underline}**. Gary **[Samore, Obama\'s adviser on
WMD, had]{.underline}** openly **[espoused]{.underline}** the notion
before taking that job **[that the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[should exploit an Israeli threat to attack
Iran to put pressure on the Iranians over their nuclear
program]{.underline}**. At a Harvard University symposium in September
2008, [Samore
opined](http://www.cfr.org/iran/iran-policy-options-next-administration/p34420)
that **[the next administration would not want to \"act in a way that
precludes the \[Israeli\] threat, because we\'re using the threat as a
political instrument.\"]{.underline}** The **[Obama]{.underline}**
administration\'**[s policy toward Iran clearly applied that Samore
strategy]{.underline}** early and often. Within weeks of his arrival in
the White House, on April 1, 2009, Obama\'s Defense Secretary Robert
**[Gates and]{.underline}** the Commander of CENTCOM David **[Petraeus
both [commented
publicly](http://ipsnorthamerica.net/news.php?idnews=2140) that Israel
was bound to attack Iran within a matter of a few years at most, unless
Iran came to heel on its nuclear program.]{.underline}** And in
mid-November 2009**[, [Obama
sent](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/25/AR2009112504112.html)
Dennis Ross and Jeffrey Bader of the White House staff to Beijing to
warn the Chinese that the United States could not restrain Israel from
an attack on Iran much longer unless the Security Council adopted a
strong package of tough economic sanctions against Iran]{.underline}**.
**[That diplomatic exploitation of the Israeli threat came seven months
after Haaretz
[reported](http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/israel-u-s-will-know-before-any-iran-strike-1.276075)]{.underline}**
in May 2009 **[that]{.underline}** CIA Director Leon **[Panetta
had]{.underline}** just **[obtained a commitment from Netanyahu and
Barak that they would not take military action without consulting
Washington first]{.underline}**. That commitment reflected a reality
that most senior national security officials accepted - that Israel
could attack Iran without US cooperation. **[What happened in late 2011
and early 2012 was a \"good cop/bad cop\" routine by Panetta and Barak
at a historical juncture when the United States and Israel were
cooperating closely in a strategy to get crippling sanctions against
Iran approved in the UN Security Council while pressuring Iran to begin
negotiating on its enrichment program]{.underline}**. Panetta\'s role in
the routine was to wring his hands over alleged indications that Israel
was intent on a strike in the spring. But **[Panetta\'s [interview with
David
Ignatius](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/is-israel-preparing-to-attack-iran/2012/02/02/gIQANjfTkQ_story.html)
in early February 2012 in which he warned of the \"strong likelihood\"
of an Israeli attack in \"April, May or June\" included a clear
give-away that the real purpose of his warning was to gain diplomatic
leverage on Iran.]{.underline}** **[He suggested to the Iranians that
there were two ways to \"dissuade the Israelis from such an attack\":
either Iran could begin serious negotiations on its nuclear program or
the United States could step up its own cyber-attacks against Iran.
Later]{.underline}** that year, of course, **[Obama would break
dramatically with Netanyahu\'s strategy]{.underline}**. But **[despite
that clear indication in early 2012 that Panetta was playing a game that
suited the interests of both administrations, consumers of the world\'s
commercial news media were led to believe that Barak and Netanyahu were
on the brink of war. Barak himself is still peddling that same
warmed-over, patently false tale of near war-war with Iran. And in one
more indicator of the degree to which the media parrot the Israeli line
on Iran, they are still reporting it as unquestioned fact
today]{.underline}**.

### No Strikes -- Military Blocks

#### No attack -- military blocks it.

**Cole 15** -- (8/24, Juan, PhD in Islamic Studies, Richard P. Mitchell
Collegiate Professor of History at the University of Michigan, "Is
Israeli military using Barak in struggle w/ Netanyahu over Iran Deal?"
http://www.juancole.com/2015/08/military-struggle-netanyahu.html)

**[In 2010]{.underline}**, Israeli chief of staff Gaby **[Ashkenazi
stopped]{.underline}** **[them]{.underline}** **[by maintaining that the
military did not have the capacity for this mission]{.underline}**.
(**[Iran is very distant]{.underline}** and **[Israel's planes can't get
there and back]{.underline}** very easily, **[nor would they be allowed
to fly over Turkey or Iraq]{.underline}**, **[nor would the Iranians
take it lying down]{.underline}**). **[In 2011, even other far right
wing hard liners]{.underline}** on the cabinet **[voted
against.]{.underline}** And in 2012, the US launched joint military
maneuvers with Israel around the time of the planned attack, which would
have made it look as though the US were behind the strike and even
**[Netanyahu and Barak couldn't risk Washington's wrath]{.underline}**.
Note that **[strikes on thousands of active centrifuges and stockpiled
enriched uranium would have released enormous amounts of radioactive
material into the air]{.underline}** of Isfahan (pop. nearly 2 million,
i.e. nearly the size of Houston, Texas), **[constituting a de facto
dirty-bomb attack on Iran]{.underline}** with large loss of life. Some
of the **[radioactive fallout would have come back on Israel
itself]{.underline}**. Apparently Barak thought that the interviews
would remain background for his book and not be leaked because military
censors in Israel would never approve them for publication or broadcast.
But the military censor has twice given Israel 2 radio the go-ahead to
broadcast excerpts from the tapes. While speculation rages in Israel
that Barak is trying to undermine his enemies as part of a bid to come
back as the head of the Labor Party and make another bid to be prime
minister (Ashkenazi is a rival here), and that trash-talking Netanyahu
is part of this plan, it seems more likely that he did not expect the
interviews to be allowed on the air. If this interpretation is true,
then it is likely that elements in the Israeli military high command
ordered the censor to allow the tapes to come out in public, and that it
is they who want Netanyahu weakened. We know that **[Israeli army chief
of staff]{.underline}** Gen. Gadi **[Eizenkot and many other high
officers do not think Iran is the primary security threat to
Israel]{.underline}**. **[It is likely that they have been extremely
annoyed by Netanyahu's challenge to]{.underline}** the
**[Obama]{.underline}** administration **[in trying to derail the Iran
deal]{.underline}** on monitoring its nuclear facilities. **[The
tapes]{.underline}** would serve the Israeli military well in any
struggle with Netanyahu. First, they **[underline that a previous chief
of staff]{.underline}**, Gaby **[Ashkenazi]{.underline}**, **[had the
ability to block the prime minister from a reckless strike on Iran in
2010]{.underline}**. Second, Barak's comments make Netanyahu look like
an unstable combination of Hamlet and Napoleon-- pessimistic, depressed,
timid, and yet capable of erratically deciding to lash out at a country
10 times the size of Israel that has millions of armed allies in Iraq,
Syria and Lebanon.

### Marxism Inadequate

#### Western Marxism is simply inadequate to address the nuances of colonialism -- the "logic" of capital is best understood through settler and exploitative colonialism.

Marxism]{.underline}** as an apprehension of the modern world, but
**[equally troubling was Marxism's neglect and miscomprehension of the
nature and genesis of liberation struggles]{.underline}** which already
had occurred and surely had yet to appear among these people."3
Consequently, Robinson offers us Black Marxism; but I want to honor and
not appropriate that crucial radical tradition in this brief sketch.
Like many, I also take it as self-evident that **[any theoretical
Marxism reconstructed to be adequate]{.underline}** for our times
**[must also be a feminist theory.]{.underline}** By post-Western
Marxism, then, I don't mean a Marxism only by, or about, or for the
people of the global South or any other geopolitical-cultural region,
nor a Marxism displaced by postcolonial theory. Rather, **[I mean a
truly global Marxism that builds on]{.underline}** the
**[insights]{.underline}** of Western Marxism, Black Marxism, Asian,
African, and Latin American Marxisms, **[but does not habitually
universalize in a gender-blind way]{.underline}** some fragments of the
**[historical experiences]{.underline}** of the United States and
Western Europe. **[It is therefore not limited by Western Marxism's
inability to think through the social, political, cultural, and
ecological realities of most of the world]{.underline}**; I mean then a
Marxist theory that is not "passing for white" in the global order of
knowledge power and a Marxist theory that is also a feminist theory in
this specific way. In these notes, I make **[three related
arguments]{.underline}**. First, **[I will argue that]{.underline}**
both for Marx and for us today, **[exploitation is best understood not
only as the private appropriation of surplus value but also as
subalternization.]{.underline}** Second, I will argue that **[Marx's
critique of the so-called "logic" of capital is best understood
through]{.underline}** our critical **[understanding of the histories of
colonization]{.underline}**; that is to say, through our understanding
of what Robinson calls "racial capitalism" and world-systems analysts
call "historical capitalism" since the modern histories of colonization
and historical or racial capitalism are essentially two sides of the
same coin. Third, I will argue that **[since class politics is not
available to us in its immediacy, all politics is identity
politics]{.underline}**, **[and that what is now commonly called the
intersectionality of class politics and identity politics]{.underline}**
or feminist or cultural **[politics is better understood as their
intermediation]{.underline}** by the something I have elsewhere called
"accumulated violence" --- the "agency" of the histories of
exploitation-subalternization in the present.4

### Identity Politics Good

#### The affirmative doesn't ignore capitalism, but it understands that Marxist analysis must center identity politics as the condition of possibility for class politics.

For **[Fanon's enduring lesson]{.underline}** --- both anticipated and
repeated ever since by the poetry, literature, and art of the oppressed
--- **[is that identities are not all historically constructed to be
ontologically equivalent]{.underline}** like signifiers qua signifier;
the discursivists miss the obvious point that **[black identity, or
indigenous identity, or immigrant identity, or feminist identity, as
political identities, are not on the same plane as masculinity or with
passing for white, or heterosexuality or ethnicity or national
identity.]{.underline}** On this issue, neither signifiers nor
eurocentric models of power or desire are pertinent. But **[the
specificities of colonizing capitalism]{.underline}**, in all their
diversity, **[are crucial. The racialized and colonized]{.underline}**,
as Fanon famously argues, **[are historically legislated and sentenced
to a "zone of non-being" through appropriation, colonization, and
racialization of the body]{.underline}** "given back to me sprawled out,
distorted, recolored."34 **[In affirming this being of non-being,
Fanon's "aporetic dialectic," as]{.underline}** Sekyi-Otu calls it,
indeed **["stretches" Marxist analyses by throwing new light on Marx's
own dialectic]{.underline}**, which seeks to render critically
intelligible the fetish character of the commodity form of value. For
Marx, this is ultimately a story of class violence wherein proprietors
run their networks of colonizing institutions in such a way that value
as the representation of capitalist wealth does not represent the common
wealth on which it depends and which Herculean capitalist class power
both encloses and appropriates. Marx draws on the colonial discourse of
the fetish, in formation ever since the Portuguese traded down the Gold
Coast of Africa in the fifteenth century, for a figure for representing
the violence with which the operations of markets in labor power and
capital restructure, subordinate, and in this way, colonize the ritual
"markets" of reciprocal exchange that constitutes the molecular media of
material life.35 **[In colonizing various lifeworlds of
political-ecological reproduction]{.underline}**, Herculean **[class
power, working through the institutions of "modern society" and
normalizing homogeneous empty clock time]{.underline}**, thereby
transforms the content, context, and consequences of everyday reciprocal
exchange, including their mediation of extant modes of domination, and
so **[subalternizes these modern counter-environments of common being
and "Hydraheaded revolt" into racialized, criminalized, misogynistically
feminized non-being of "relationships between things" that thus form an
abstract colonial value matrix of assets and instruments of capitalist
accumulation.]{.underline}**36 However, like Marx, Fanon's dialectic
also finds here the seeds of "sober senses" through which a
counter-environmental universality that is radically different from that
of the proprietors emerges as a real abstraction. **[So with
Fanon]{.underline}**, but also Adorno, **[I want to insist
on]{.underline}** the "utterly naked declivity," **[the ultimate
"primacy of the object," on the historical, intersubjective, mediatory
objectivity of accumulated violence through which]{.underline}** the
singular **[histories of subalternization interlock and with which the
different oppressions are then stamped. The Eurocentric]{.underline}**,
Herculean **[sciences and humanities remain caught in]{.underline}**
their various **[racializing, exoticizing, Orientalizing idioms of
repression and erasure.]{.underline}** Nonetheless, the singular
histories of subalternization are now manifestations of our common being
and we can study and learn from them. But we can also now understand how
and why **[identity politics is then the condition of possibility of
class politics]{.underline}** from below and cannot be simply explained
away as the legacy of post-war social movements from the Combahee River
Collective onwards plus consumerism. **[Rather the discourses and
practices of identity]{.underline}** of the past half-century, in
whatever ways they are unprecedented, **[are themselves popular cultural
sites of hegemonic struggle and this conjunctural experience adds weight
to]{.underline}** Etienne **[Balibar's argument that there are no
classes in themselves, only classes for themselves, no classes without
active and organized class struggle.]{.underline}**37 **[Insofar as
class politics]{.underline}** from **[below is by
definition]{.underline}** then a **[matter of mass politics, a class
politics on the Left begins not merely with vague demands for jobs,
better working conditions, rights in production that the parliamentary
Left restricts itself to]{.underline}** (for the Right can fight for
these too), **[but with an organized mass struggle for the regeneration
of common being and the abolition of accumulated violence as the
necessary condition of a just ecology of planetary
reproduction.]{.underline}**

### Perm

#### Perm do both -- disentangling settler colonialism with colonialism as exploitation is ahistorical

Accumulated Violence

We find a promising starting point for post-Western Marxist theory in
the growing interest in recent years in Marx's sarcastic critique of
classical political economy's fable of primitive accumulation.10
**[Rather than capital springing forth from the prudence]{.underline}**
and thrift of proprietors, **[Marx points instead to the violence of
enclosures, colonial plunder, and the trans-Atlantic slave trade as
specific violent forms of class power exercised in order to create a new
trans-Atlantic, and]{.underline}** eventually, **[global space making
the accumulation of capital possible.]{.underline}**11 **[These class
projects are comprised of innumerable]{.underline}** more specific
**[forms of power and violence ranging from war, conquest, and genocide
to impressment, criminalization, encroachment, expulsion, confiscation,
monetization, taxation, commodification, debt bondage, environmental
destruction, disentitlement, religious conversion and so on. Each of
these strategies]{.underline}** and tactics **[of class power sets in
place]{.underline}**, Marx argues, **[the conditions of possibility of
world scale capital accumulation.]{.underline}** Insofar as these
strategies and tactics are recurrent, David Harvey renames all this as
"accumulation by dispossession" and argues that **[accumulation by
dispossession intensifies as accumulation crises
intensify.]{.underline}** This reading of Marx's critical genealogy
anchors Harvey's theory of "spatial-temporal fixes" in class politics
and struggle. **["Solutions" to accumulation crises are only "found"
through class struggle but]{.underline}** as Harvey demonstrates **[they
involve the production of new]{.underline}** spaces and **[temporalities
of accumulation]{.underline}**. Though Harvey's own work often
underplays it, his mentor Henri Lefebvre's foundational contribution to
Western Marxism makes it clear that the **[capitalist
production]{.underline}** of space **[is never ex-nihilo but rather
unfolds "backwards]{.underline}**," as in Walter Benjamin's image of the
"angel of history," **[from the destruction and subalternization of
other modes of socio-ecological reproduction:]{.underline}** "the
Spanish-American '**[Orders for Discovery and
Settlement'"]{.underline}** --- which laid the foundations of the now
globalized urban grid plan, Lefebvre reminds us --- **["were arranged
under the three heads of discovery, settlement and
pacification."]{.underline}** "A social space of this kind" he observes
"is generated out of a rationalized and theorized form serving as an
instrument for the violation of an existing space."12 **[Therein lies
the inner connection]{.underline}**, I argue, **[between colonialism and
capitalism: "Geometrical urban space in Latin America,"]{.underline}**
Lefebvre continues**[, "was intimately bound up with the extraction of
wealth in Western Europe]{.underline}**; it is almost as though the
riches produced were riddled out through the gaps in the grid**[, the
pre-existing space was destroyed from top to bottom."]{.underline}**13
In its investigations of the spaces and times of exploitation and in its
theorization of their articulations, post-Western Marxism does not
ignore this other "materialist telos" in human history: **[the
reproduction of capitalist wealth and capitalist social relations of
production is necessarily a "Herculean" class project of
world-making]{.underline}**, as Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker
describe it in their magisterial history **[of the making of
trans-Atlantic capitalism.]{.underline}**14 As such, **[the capitalist
mode of socio-ecological reproduction]{.underline}**, indeed its
productivity gains through ever greater scales of social cooperation,
**[understood as historical process]{.underline}** (and not as a logic
but rather as the witnessed ecological fate of the collective
speciesbeing of the human body) **[is nothing other than the repeated
destruction of other modes of socio-ecological
reproduction]{.underline}**, past and future, through the scalar
expansion of its world-environments. But this also means that **[the
distinction between settler colonialism and the colonialisms of
exploitation is a schematic distinction]{.underline}** at best **[which
obscures rather than clarifies the geography and geometry of colonial
power since land-grabbing has long been connected to environment-making
for commodity production.]{.underline}**15 Indeed, modern colonialism
cannot be understood historically nor resisted today without reference
to the circuit of value of capital accumulation with its specifically
violent spatial production. Otherwise the history of humanity is the
history of settler colonialism which begins, not with the English
re-conquest of Ireland, but when we descended from the trees and
colonized the savannah. I therefore want to contextualize Harvey's
arguments by considering here a few other critical engagements with this
enigmatic chapter from Capital. I hope to demonstrate here that
**[together they provide a far more compelling account of exploitation
and its links to domination and dispossession,]{.underline}**
**[theoretically and historically, than the standard arithmetic of
exploitation based on the calculation of surplus labor
time]{.underline}** beyond average socially necessary labor time that
usually stands at the center of our understanding of Marx's critique.
Let me be clear, though: I am not suggesting that this received view is
wrong or obsolete. Marx's comparison of the political and reproductive
affordance of the wage to the productive and political power of
cooperation proprietors of capital appropriate is pertinent as ever. The
wage, however, is a social, ecological and historical institution, and
not just a sum of money. **[Even when the fetishism of the value form is
understood as social domination, capitalism's]{.underline}** historical
and contemporary **[colonizing imperative is given short shrift and the
possibility]{.underline}** that **[the subalternized
counter-environments]{.underline}** of this witnessed historical world
environment-making process **[might hold critical lessons for the
present is overlooked.]{.underline}**16 A **[qualitative account of
exploitation]{.underline}**, if I may put it that way, **[as accumulated
violence]{.underline}** and class war **[would,]{.underline}** I argue
here, **[take us further in the direction of the]{.underline}** more
properly post-Western **[Marxism]{.underline}** that **[we urgently need
today.]{.underline}**

## A2: Distract From Local

#### Settler colonial theory provides the intellectual and activist frame necessary to translate our scholarship beyond the mere moral outrage. Yet, commitment to decolonization does not require us to ignore the difficult practicalities of decolonization. Using the settler colonial state to challenge settler colonialism elsewhere does not require us to disavow settler colonialism here, only that we take accept the complexity of current geopolitics.

**Busbridge 18** (Rachel, Lecturer in Sociology at the Australian
Catholic University, Melbourne "Israel-Palestine and the Settler
Colonial 'Turn': From Interpretation to Decolonization" *Theory, Culture
& Society* 35, no. 1, p. 110-111) NIJ

**[In his assessment of the dire state of contemporary Palestinian
politics, Hilal]{.underline}** (2015: 360) **[yearns for 'an investment
in cultural and \...social capital, through informal and formal
associations, the social media and cross-border interaction and
collaborative efforts, to keep Palestine alive as a symbol of
emancipation, freedom and justice'.]{.underline}** As I have sought to
show, **[the settler colonial paradigm may indeed be facilitating this:
not only does it provide international audiences a far more readable and
cohesive frame with which to understand the conflict, but it comes with
a built-in solidarity. Additionally, and most vitally, it promises to
rejuvenate the Palestinian struggle under the prescriptive banner of
decolonization, opening up new debates and alternatives outside of an
evidently failing two-state paradigm.]{.underline}**
**[Yet]{.underline}**, as I have also argued, **[this is where the most
strident limitations of the settler colonial paradigm paradoxically come
into view, due to]{.underline}**, at best, **[under-developed reflection
on the possibilities and practicalities of decolonization
and]{.underline}**, at worst, **[connotations deriving from its
contextual point of origin flattening out important local historical and
socio-political specificities. I highlight these
limitations]{.underline}** not to challenge the paradigm's applicability
to Israel-Palestine, but **[to appeal for greater rigour and
attentiveness to particularity.]{.underline}** I have sought to gesture
towards some of these particularities -- namely, the role of nationalism
and the peculiar resonances of the settler/native distinction. By way of
conclusion, however, **[I would like to point towards the challenges of
the settler colonial paradigm's insistence on an ontology of absolute
polarity of settler and native for the types of political mobilizations
and struggles it could inaugurate.]{.underline}** To be sure, **[there
are immense difficulties in reckoning with heterogeneity in seemingly
permanent structures of settler colonialism which all too easily
assimilate nuance into legitimation; these difficulties are only
amplified in the context of long-term intractable conflict like that in
Israel-Palestine. Yet]{.underline}**, as Joyce Dalsheim (2013) has
argued in the context of Israeli settlers, **[the entrenchment of
polarized discourse means that we often miss alternative models of
political community that may better serve the project of decolonization.
It would certainly be a shame for the paradigm's inconsistencies
regarding a decolonization effectively rendered impossible to stand
against its broader resonance]{.underline}**, just as it would the
disciplinary dimensions of the settler colonial ontology to shut down
debate -- or, indeed, joint mobilization -- between those broadly on the
same page concerning Palestine. In his work on joint Arab-Jewish
activism, Marcelo Svirsky (2014: 328) maintains that **[what settler
colonial studies needs 'is a corrective ontology and an affective change
of heart'. I thus end with the caution that without this affective
change in heart the settler colonial paradigm may continue to facilitate
transnational solidarity and international sympathy, but may ultimately
fail to extend beyond a politics of moral outrage.]{.underline}**
