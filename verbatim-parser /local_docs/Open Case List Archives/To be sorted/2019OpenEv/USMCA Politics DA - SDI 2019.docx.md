strat notes:

the link story is that currently, the usmca bill with pass in the status
quo due to trump's political capital. trump likes arm sales, so he would
veto the plan, but fiat ensures that his veto is overridden. this decks
his pc, and means that uscma doesn't pass. there are three impact mods:
agriculture, pharma, and econ.

neg notes: the internal link chain is fairly nuanced so read through the
file to make sure you understand it. the link to saudi arabia is really
good, as trump has recently vetoed congressional attempts to stop arm
sales, and they can't really get out of that. to taiwan and other affs,
the link is less good, but still winnable if you understand the nuances.
be prepared to debate the internal links to the impacts, as there is
lots of writing out there from all perspectives. the neg can win that a
reduction in us food industry goes global and leads to a lot of impacts,
focus on proving that usmca is key.

aff notes: same as the neg, read through the file before debating it
understand the link story and the weakest points of the da. in my
opinion, the weakest points of the da are the uniqueness and the
internal links, go hard on that. there are some impact internal link
turns that could lead to some really interesting debates (warming, and
drug prices). go hard on the usmca as the internal link to the ag
scenario, and beat the da there. there is good root cause debate that
conflict causes food insecurity, not the other way around.

#### USMCA passes now- few hurdles remain

[[U.S. Trade Rep]{.mark}resentative Robert [Lighthizer is expected to
meet with]{.mark} House Speaker Nancy [Pelosi]{.mark}'s working group on
Capitol Hill Thursday [to discuss passing the new trade deal]{.mark}
with Mexico and Canada]{.underline}. [Both [the administration and House
Democrats are]{.mark} believed to be [working "in good faith" to]{.mark}
get [an]{.mark} [agreement]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[[White House adviser]{.underline}]{.mark} Marc [[Short]{.mark} told FOX
Business he [is optimistic the deal will come together]{.mark} on both
sides]{.underline}.

"[We think that [it has the votes]{.mark},"]{.underline} Short told
Maria Bartiromo. "The reality is that [[there are 31 congressional
Democrats residing in districts that]{.mark} Donald [Trump won in
2016]{.mark}]{.underline}. But more importantly, [those are
[districts]{.mark} that [create an enormous number of manufacturing jobs

[needs to be]{.mark}, I think, some [additional work with]{.mark}
\[House\] Speaker \[Nancy\] [Pelosi]{.mark} because she holds the keys
about when she gets to bring it to the floor for a vote."]{.underline}

As for the timing of the deal Short said, "I think that the reality is
it\'s more likely to happen this fall. [[We are]{.mark} certainly
[hopeful of that happening this summer]{.mark} but [we\'re going
to]{.mark} remain encouraged and we\'re going to [keep pushing]{.mark}
for this,"]{.underline} he said. [The administration sent Pelosi notice
last month that it was ready to submit the USMCA deal,]{.underline}
which would replace the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement.

Writing before the mid-term election results are in, we anticipate that
President Donald J. [Trump will continue to aggressively pursue his
original campaign pledge to rebalance relationships with key US trading
partners]{.underline}. Whichever party controls either chamber of
Congress, [President [Trump will likely continue pushing]{.mark} the
boundaries of Executive authority to pursue policy objectives
unilaterally. The President will not, however, be able to ignore
Congress entirely]{.underline}. President [Trump will quickly need the
new Congress for legislation [to implement the]{.mark} US -- Mexico --
Canada ([USMCA) trade agreement]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is a key
policy objective for President Trump, and was a leading campaign promise
in 2016. Yet, Congressional approval of the deal is far from certain,
regardless of which party controls the House and Senate. [[The
President]{.mark} and his team [will have to expend significant
political capital to move the USMCA through
Congress]{.mark}]{.underline}. Similarly, [President [Trump will need
Congressional support to implement any]{.mark} bilateral [trade
agreements the Administration negotiates]{.mark}]{.underline} with the
United Kingdom (UK), the European Union (EU), and other sovereign
nations in the next two years. But, [because trade does not cut along
party lines, President Trump\'s disruptive trade policies could find
allies and opponents on both sides of the aisle]{.underline}

#### Trump's desire to increase arm sales means he vetoes the plan- fiat means that Congress overrides this veto

WASHINGTON (Reuters) [- U.S. [arms sales]{.mark} to foreign governments
[rose 13 percent]{.mark} to \$192.3 billion [in the
year]{.mark}]{.underline} ending Sept. 30, the State Department said on
Thursday, [[a result of looser restrictions on sales]{.mark} coupled
[with]{.mark} high-level [efforts to close deals]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[President Donald [Trump wants to make the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, [already dominant in the global weapons
trade, [an even bigger arms merchant to the world]{.mark}]{.underline},
U.S. officials have said, despite concerns among human rights and arms
control advocates.

The largest U.S. arms contractors, who sell ships, tanks, airplanes,
missiles and other goods to foreign militaries, include Boeing Co
(BA.N), Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), Raytheon Co (RTN.N), General
Dynamics Corp (GD.N) and Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N).

[The [increase came in part because]{.mark} the Trump administration
rolled out a new "[Buy American" plan]{.mark} in April]{.underline} that
[[relaxed restrictions on sales]{.mark} while encouraging U.S. officials
to take a bigger role in increasing business overseas for the U.S.
weapons industry.]{.underline}

There are two major ways foreign governments purchase arms from U.S.
companies: direct commercial sales, negotiated between a government and
a company; and foreign military sales, in which a foreign government
works with the Pentagon on a potential deal. Both require approval by
the U.S. government.

Commercial sales of U.S. military equipment to foreign governments rose
6.6 percent from \$128.1 billion to \$136.6 billion in the fiscal year,
the State Department said.

In October, the government said [U.S. [foreign military sales rose 33
percent to \$55.6 billion in the fiscal year]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Combined, the total is a 13 percent year-on-year increase in weapons
exports.

#### An unsuccessful veto [obliterates]{.underline} Trump's PC- cannot pass USMCA

**Zipperer 18** \-\-- Eddie Zipperer, political science professor at
Georgia Military College, opinion writer for The Hill, ("Why Vetoing The
Omnibus Could Have Been Disastrous For Trump", 3-26-2018, Daily Caller,
https://dailycaller.com/2018/03/26/why-vetoing-the-omnibus-could-have-been-disastrous-for-trump/)

Remember all those checks and balances from your high school Civics
class? Sure the President can veto a bill passed by Congress, but then
Congress can veto the veto. What they don't teach in that civics class
are the implications of a veto override. [[If Trump had been
overridden]{.mark} the very first time he ever exercised the veto
power]{.underline}, [[it would have sent the message that Congress has
the final say]{.mark}---that Congress is in charge, [and the
president]{.mark}, who is being investigated by a special
council]{.underline}, is up to his ears in sex scandals being pushed by
the mainstream media, and whose approval rating hovers around 40
percent, **[[is a lame-duck rubber stamp]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[It
would have been a disastrous rebuke]{.underline}]{.mark} of President
Trump, [[and it would have dealt a **severe blow** to
his]{.underline}]{.mark} already-overdrawn account of **[[political
capital]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Throughout American history, the average
Presidential success rate when exercising the veto is about 88 percent.
Only around 20 times has a president had a veto overridden when his
party controlled both houses of Congress. That hasn't happened to any
president since it happened to one-term-disaster Jimmy Carter 38 years
ago.

#### Failing to pass USMCA kills agriculture. 

**Duvall 19** --- Zippy Duvall, President of the American Farm Bureau
Federation, former president of the Georgia Farm Bureau, 2019 ("U.S. Ag
Gets a Great Deal with USMCA," *American Farm Bureau Federation*, April

https://www.fb.org/viewpoints/u.s.-ag-gets-a-great-deal-with-usmca,
Accessed 07-22-2019) PRK

[Farmers know a good deal when we see one.]{.underline} We watch every
penny and stretch every dollar as far as it can go. We fix up our
tractors and repair our old pickup trucks year after year, hoping to get
yet another season out of them.

At the same time, we always have our eye on the latest technology and
tools that will make our farms and ranches more productive and more
efficient. I don't know a farmer or rancher who would pass up a good
deal that could make their business better. The same is true when it
comes to trade deals. [When [NAFTA]{.mark} was signed more than 25 years
ago, it [was the best trade deal]{.mark} U.S.
[ag]{.mark}]{.underline}riculture [[had]{.mark} ever [seen]{.mark}. But
now [there's a new deal]{.mark} on offer---the U.S.-Mexico-Canada
Agreement or [USMCA]{.mark}. [We have a chance to trade in a great
agreement for a]{.mark}n **even [better one.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Since NAFTA went into effect in 1994, U.S. ag exports to Canada and
Mexico have more than quadrupled, making these our number 1 and number 2
markets respectively. In 2018 alone, we exported \$20.7 billion in ag
products to Canada and \$19 billion to Mexico.

These [markets have only grown in value for U.S. farmers and
ranchers]{.underline}. Over the last decade, ag exports have increased
27 percent to Canada and 23 percent to Mexico.

[But as good as NAFTA has been, [it's time for an upgrade]{.mark}: [it's
time for Congress to approve USMCA.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Without USMCA, [our most critical markets hang in the
balance]{.mark}.]{.underline} Both Canada and Mexico have already signed
another deal that does not include the United States. The Comprehensive
and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership replaces the TPP
agreement that the U.S. agreed to but then backed out of in 2017. The
CPTPP gives Canada and Mexico preferential trade terms with nine other
countries and gives those countries better access to Canada's and
Mexico's markets―all while the ongoing trade war hangs overhead, with
tariffs hurting U.S. agricultural exports. Just this week, Japan is
following through on its promises under the CPTPP and reducing its
tariffs and raising its quotas for ag products from CPTPP partners. This
is all the more reason [why [we must bring the USMCA across the finish
line]{.mark} and secure our valuable trade partnership with our nearest
neighbors.]{.underline}

[The USMCA is also important in setting the stage for other modern trade
agreements for U.S. agriculture. NAFTA needed to be modernized, and the
USMCA has bells and whistles]{.underline} that we don't have under our
existing trade agreements. Let's look under the hood. For the U.S., it's
the first trade agreement to deal with approval of and trade in products
of biotechnology. This groundwork will be critical in agreements we
pursue with other countries, especially in the EU, the UK and Japan. The
new agreement broadens access for U.S. dairy and finally brings an end
to Canada's unfair class 7 pricing scheme. These are wins we didn't see
even under TPP. Finally, USMCA will bring greater access for poultry,
improve wheat grading standards, and make much-needed improvements to
animal and plant health protection standards.

Finally, ratifying the USMCA will show our top trading partners and
other countries that the United States and the trade negotiators who
represent us mean business. It would prove that our word and handshake
can be trusted when we strike a deal.

Right now, it's important for each of us to [call on our lawmakers in
Washington and tell them how important the USMCA is to agriculture.
[Farmers]{.mark} and ranchers [are resilient, but]{.mark} our
[businesses]{.mark}---not to mention the jobs and rural communities that
depend on us---[**cannot survive** without our top markets. Let's get
this deal done, so we can move forward with]{.mark} opening and
[expanding]{.mark} more markets around the globe.]{.underline}

[As [demand for food]{.mark} rises faster than supplies are growing, the
resulting food-price inflation [puts]{.mark} [severe stress on]{.mark}
the [governments]{.mark} of countries [already teetering on the edge of
chaos]{.mark}. Unable to buy grain or grow their own, hungry people take
to the streets]{.underline}. Indeed, even before the steep climb in
grain prices in 2008, [the number of failing states was
expanding]{.underline} \[Purchase the digital edition to see related
sidebar\]. Many of their problems stem from a failure to slow the growth
of their populations. But [[if the food situation continues to
deteriorate, entire nations will break down]{.mark} at an ever
increasing rate]{.underline}. We have entered a new era in geopolitics.
In the 20th century [[the main threat to international security]{.mark}
was superpower conflict; today it [is failing states]{.mark}. It is not
the concentration of power but its absence that puts us at
risk.]{.underline}

**[[States fail when national governments can no longer provide]{.mark}
personal security, [food security]{.mark}]{.underline}** and basic
social services such as education and health care. They often lose
control of part or all of their territory. [When [governments lose
their]{.mark} monopoly on power, [law and order]{.mark} begin to
disintegrate]{.underline}. After a point, countries can become so
dangerous that food relief workers are no longer safe and their programs
are halted; in Somalia and Afghanistan, deteriorating conditions have
already put such programs in jeopardy.

**[[Failing states are of international concern because]{.mark} t[hey
are a source of terrorists, drugs, weapons and refugees, threatening
political stability everywhere]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Somalia, number
one on the 2008 list of failing states, has become a base for piracy.
Iraq, number five, is a hotbed for terrorist training. Afghanistan,
number seven, is the world's leading supplier of heroin. Following the
massive genocide of 1994 in Rwanda, refugees from that troubled state,
thousands of armed soldiers among them, helped to destabilize
neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo (number six).

[[Our global civilization depends on]{.mark} a functioning network of
politically [healthy nation-states to control the spread of]{.mark}
infectious [disease]{.mark}, to [manage the international monetary
system,]{.mark} to [control international terrorism]{.mark} and to reach
scores of other common goals.]{.underline} If the system for controlling
infectious diseases---such as polio, SARS or avian flu---breaks down,
humanity will be in trouble. [Once states fail, no one assumes
responsibility for their debt to outside lenders. [If]{.mark} enough
[states disintegrate]{.mark}, [their fall will threaten]{.mark} the
stability of global [civilization itself.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[House Democrats]{.mark} are expressing optimism as they [begin]{.mark}
what could be [the final stage of negotiations]{.mark} [to

priority]{.mark}.]{.underline} Speaker Nancy [Pelosi on Tuesday is
expected to formally name lawmakers to the working groups that will work
with the administration on the labor, environment and pharmaceutical
provisions that Democrats are seeking to strengthen.]{.underline} Pelosi
has also emphasized the need for strong enforcement mechanisms in the
accord that will overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement. Ways
and Means Chairman Richard Neal, the Massachusetts Democrat leading
talks with U.S. Trade Representative Robert [[Lighthizer]{.mark},
said]{.underline} Monday h[e [hopes a deal can be finalized within 30
days]{.mark}. The [Trump]{.mark} administration [has signaled plans to
send a bill]{.mark} implementing the USMCA to Congress [by the end
of]{.mark} [the month]{.mark} to prod lawmakers to vote on it before the
August recess.]{.underline} These signs of progress come after Trump
withdrew his threat to impose tariffs on Mexican imports over unrelated
immigration concerns. Senate Republicans applauded that decision, and
Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley met Monday with Pelosi, Neal and
Ways and Means Republican Kevin Brady to discuss how to move forward on
the USMCA. "We just wanted to point out despite the chaotic nature of
the tariff situation, we still wanted to stitch this up," Neal said.
Grassley requested that meeting, and he told House Democrats he wants to
be helpful in completing the USMCA, according to a Democratic aide.
Pelosi used the meeting to explain the provisions that need to be
reinforced to get more House Democrats to support the deal, the aide
said. ["[We want to be on a path to yes," Pelosi said]{.mark} at a
Peterson Foundation event Tuesday, stressing the need for strong
enforcement]{.underline}. If all parties can't be held to the agreement,
she said, "you're just having NAFTA with sprinkles on top." Economic
Growth Grassley described Monday's meeting with Pelosi as "very
successful." "[I think [they're putting a good-faith effort to work out
differences]{.mark}," Grassley [said of House Democrats]{.mark}.
"There's a process in place to do it. But those differences will have to
be worked out before we move it.]{.underline} The Senate Finance
Committee will hold a hearing June 18 with Lighthizer to discuss the
USMCA, Grassley later said in a statement. For weeks [Republicans have
said that the [USMCA already has enough votes to pass, counting on a
combination of]{.mark} pro-trade lawmakers from [both parties.]{.mark}
Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said Tuesday "[everybody
knows it will pass the House]{.mark},"]{.underline} but suggested that
Pelosi is holding out to get not only a majority of the full House of
Representatives, but also a majority of her caucus. Trump also urged
Congress to "do its job" and pass the trade deal that farmers are
[counting
on](https://www.republicanwhip.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/6.11.19-USMCA_Grassroots_Letter.pdf)
to secure the export markets they count on for their livelihood. On my
way to Iowa - just heard nearly 1,000 agriculture groups signed a letter
urging Congress to approve the USMCA. Our Patriot Farmers & rural
America have spoken! Now Congress must do its job & support these great
men and women by passing the bipartisan USMCA Trade Agreement! White
House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said ratifying the USMCA could be a
more important boost to the U.S. economy than reaching a trade deal with
China. Congressional approval of Trump's trade deal, which modernizes
but doesn't fundamentally change the decades-old NAFTA, could add half a
percentage point to economic growth, Kudlow said in a Tuesday interview
on CNBC. 'Unresolved Issues' A bicameral, bipartisan trade committee
staff delegation returned Saturday from a fact-finding mission in
Mexico, armed with suggestions on how the labor sections of the USMCA
can be improved. Democrats are working on turning those ideas into a
concrete offer to the White House, according to another Democratic aide
who asked not to be identified when talking about private discussions.
"There are some unresolved issues; the task force is being formed now,"
said Democratic Representative Ron Kind, a member of the Ways and Means
Committee. "The time has come to put something on paper." Kind said
Trump's decision not to impose the Mexico tariffs and to lift the steel
and aluminum tariffs the president previously imposed on Mexico and
Canada "will help focus a lot on the issues that need to be resolved."
The Wisconsin Democrat said he is pushing the administration to increase
funding for the arm of the U.S. Labor Department that monitors
international labor rights as part of any deal. Pelosi said Tuesday she
was interested in a
[proposal](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-08/democrats-try-to-smooth-trade-deal-passage-with-labor-proposal)
from Democratic Senators Sherrod Brown and Ron Wyden that could help
Mexico enforce the provisions to support workers. "There is a growing
awareness that you don't get in the ballpark without a tough enforcement
regime," Wyden said. "There's been a lot of back and forth and long
meetings with the Trump administration on this. " The House Democratic
staff returned from Mexico hopeful that country can implement its labor
revisions, while acknowledging that it could take four to six years.
Among the staff suggestions are changes to the USMCA to aid Mexico's
labor overhaul, which includes setting up new institutions and auditing
700,000 collective bargaining agreements. Mexico is engaged in austerity
measures that could stymie the labor changes by depriving them of
workplace inspectors. The staff delegation also discussed environment
issues and is working on proposals on that. In Good Faith ["I talked to
[Ambassador Lighthizer]{.mark} last night and everyone [understands the
things that need to be fixed]{.mark}," said Representative Debbie
Dingell of Michigan. "There are [a number of us]{.mark} who [want to get
a trade bill. We need a new NAFTA." "People are working]{.mark} toward
getting a good bill,"]{.underline} Dingell added. [[Democrats say they
will continue to work in good faith]{.mark} even as they fear that Trump
could once again threaten Mexico if he feels pressure over
migration]{.underline}. The key sticking point may be how to improve
enforcement. Under the original NAFTA, its provisions are enforced by
binding arbitration panels. Those are no longer used because the country
accused of a violation can simply block the formation of a panel.
Democrats are mulling whether to propose outlawing panel-blocking under
the new agreement. Rhode Island Democrat David Cicilline, the Democratic
Policy and Communications Committee chairman, said he is also
optimistic. [["I think everyone has been very clear about what it would
take to have sufficient Democrats votes to
prevail,]{.underline}]{.mark}" he said.

You might have heard that President Donald [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}
struck another fatal blow to multilateral diplomacy last week when he
[[announced that the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [would
withdraw]{.mark} its signature [from the Arms Trade Treaty]{.mark} [and
would no longer]{.mark} seek to [ratify]{.mark} the landmark agreement
[regulating the international trade in conventional
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. With great flair and flourish, Trump
signed a letter while onstage at the National Rifle Association's annual
conference asking for the Senate to return the Arms Trade Treaty to the
White House so it could "be disposed of." While this act may prove
politically expedient for Trump in the short term, it is wrought with
longer-term strategic and diplomatic challenges that could haunt the
United States for years to come.

In remarks crafted to appeal to special interest groups, [Trump repeated
typical gun lobby talking points about the Arms Trade Treaty that
demonstrate a willful mischaracterization of the treaty's intent and
effect]{.underline}. Commenting that the treaty threatens the rights of
U.S. citizens, [[Trump exclaimed]{.mark} that "we will never allow
foreign bureaucrats to trample on your Second Amendment freedom" and
that "[we will never surrender American sovereignty to
anyone.]{.mark}]{.underline}[" [Such statements]{.underline}]{.mark}
[not only reinforce a false narrative about the Arms Trade Treaty, but
[risk isolating]{.mark} the United States [from]{.mark} its closest
[allies that remain committed to]{.mark} increasing [responsibility,
]{.mark}]{.underline}mitigating human rights abuses, and addressing
security concerns associated [[with the unregulated global trade in
conventional arms]{.underline}.]{.mark}

What Does the Arms Trade Treaty Do?

Contrary to the president's statement, the Arms Trade Treaty does not
limit U.S. sovereignty over arms export decisions, nor does it put a
foreign government in charge of U.S. domestic regulations. The treaty
regulates only the international trade in conventional arms --- that's
all weapons from small arms to fighter jets and everything in between.
Its stated purpose is to contribute to international peace and security
and reduce human suffering caused by the irresponsible and illicit arms
trade. The Arms Trade Treaty also promotes transparency and
accountability in the global arms trade [by requiring governments to
report annually on their arms exports and imports, building confidence
in what has historically been an opaque busines]{.underline}s.

The treaty encourages governments to stop supplying lethal weapons of
war to human rights abusers, violators of international humanitarian
law, terrorists, and organized criminals by prohibiting certain kinds of
arms transfers and establishing specific criteria for making arms
transfer decisions (all of which are already reflected in U.S. law and
regulations). These are not controversial measures. It is common sense
to ensure that the weapons the United States sells are used for the
purposes intended and do not undermine American national security
interests, foreign policy objectives, economic priorities, or principles
and values.

In simple terms, the [Arms Trade Treaty tells governments what to do in
order to participate in the arms trade responsibly, but not how to do
it. It provides a flexible approach that allows governments to
right-size their national arms transfer control systems --- the laws,
regulations, and policies that governments have to control arms moving
into, out of, and through their territories.]{.underline} Not everyone
needs a system as sophisticated as the United States, for example --- no
other country does as much arms trading. But [the treaty mandates that
participating governments have national control systems with control
lists of items that are subject to import, export, brokering and transit
and transshipment regulations.]{.underline} [[These requirements]{.mark}
are common-sense elements of every national control system]{.underline}.
They do not create a burden. [Rather, they simply [make legitimate trade
more efficient and help curb diversion of legal weapons to illegal
markets]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} For example, the treaty requires
governments to develop laws and regulations for arms brokering ---
closing a loophole that has allowed nefarious arms brokers to skirt a
patchwork of national laws and avoid detection. While [[Trump's remarks
seriously misrepresent the nature and purpose of the
treat]{.mark}y,]{.underline} he was right about one thing: Most
Americans have never heard of the Arms Trade Treaty. The treaty was
negotiated over a five-year period that began in the George W. Bush
administration, was adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in April 2013,
and was signed by then-Secretary of State John Kerry several months
later.

Notably, there was initially a [parliamentary
question](https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/bipartisan-senate-group-seek-block-saudi-arms-sales-trump-administration-tries-avoid-congressional-review)
as to whether **[[joint resolutions on arms sales]{.mark}]{.underline}**
moved forward under the emergency exception could qualify for the
Section 601 expedited procedures---an ineligibility, perhaps, that the
Trump administration had been relying on. The Senate parliamentarian
appears to have resolved this question in favor of the resolutions'
sponsors, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has since
[confirmed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-10/senate-republicans-join-in-rebuke-of-trump-over-saudi-arms-sales)
that a vote to move the resolutions out of committee could take place as
soon as next week. Moreover, unlike concurrent resolutions in the
original AECA, any joint resolutions that are enacted into law through
these procedures will be free-standing legislation with independent
force of law. As a result, the resolutions' directive that each of the
22 specified transactions "is prohibited" should still be binding on the
executive branch. That said, it seems unlikely that any of the joint
resolutions will reach this stage. [Given that each is co-sponsored by
four Republican senators]{.underline}, [they seem to have the minimum
votes necessary to pass the Senate as well as the Democrat-controlled
House]{.underline}. **[But [Trump is almost certain to veto
them]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and it seems unlikely that two-thirds of
both the House and the Senate will support an effort to override these
vetoes. As a result, [[the outcome]{.mark} here [is likely to
resemble]{.mark} the outcome of the [Yemen war powers debate]{.mark},
[with Trump using his veto to continue to pursue his
**increasingly**]{.mark} **[unpopular]{.mark} Yemen [policies]{.mark}**
[over **bipartisan objections**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But to arrive
here, the Trump administration will have to weather many more rounds of
floor debate that will put bipartisan objections to the president's
Yemen policies on full display and associate his Republican allies with
an increasingly unpopular war. And the numerous vetoes Trump will have
to deploy will no doubt make clear to what extent he is pursuing those
policies without the support of Congress.

Washington (CNN) [[US foreign military sales totaled \$55.66 billion in
2018, a 33% increase compared to]{.mark} the nearly \$42 billion in
weapons sold in [2017]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} the Defense
Cooperation Agency announced Wednesday.

[[It is the highest annual total for military sales]{.mark} to foreign
governments [since 2012]{.mark}]{.underline} when the US conducted
upwards of \$69 billion in arms deals with allies and partners around
the world.

[The [upward trend is due]{.mark}, in part, [to]{.mark} the
[Trump]{.mark} administration[\'s push to relax restrictions]{.mark} on
foreign military sales.]{.underline} Though critics suggest human rights
concerns are being relegated in the rush to increase sales.

Since taking office, [President Donald [Trump has demonstrated an
insatiable appetite for selling]{.mark} American weaponry
[abroad]{.mark}]{.underline} \-- at times using face-to-face meetings
with foreign leaders to make a personal sales pitch.

Trump signed a nearly \$110 billion defense deal with Saudi Arabia\'s
King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud in May last year in the Saudi capital,
Riyadh, on what was his first stop abroad as President.

In the same month, the US government reauthorized the export of Paveway
munitions to Saudi Arabia, ending Obama\'s December 2016 ban.

He has also encouraged US officials to take on a more active role in
facilitating foreign military sales abroad in order to increase business
for the US weapons industry.

How [[Trump plans to arm the world with US weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}

\"[These policy changes advance US national security and foreign policy
because they make FMS more attractive in a very competitive
market]{.underline},\" DSCA Director LTG Charles W. Hooper said in a
statement on Wednesday.

\"The United States not only sells the world\'s most state-of-the-art
defense systems, but we also strengthen our alliances and attract new
partners through enduring strategic and defense partnership,\" he added.

Under the Trump administration\'s Conventional Arms Transfer (CAT)
policy and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) export policy, private US
defense companies are allowed to directly sell some types of
conventional weapons and a broader range of unmanned drones to allies
without having to go through the US government.

WASHINGTON --- [[America's largest business lobby is hailing the Trump

"The U.S. Chamber of Commerce Defense and Aerospace Export Council
(DAEC) welcomes the State Department's announcement regarding the
approved implementation plan for the Conventional Arms Transfer (CAT)
Policy,\" council President Keith Webster said in a statement Friday.

[The U.S. [State Department]{.mark} this week [announced its]{.mark}
planned [process to]{.mark} implement the Conventional Arms Transfer
policy, which [add]{.mark}s [economic security as a factor]{.mark} when
[the government considers]{.mark} whether to approve arms exports. [It
intends for the executive]{.mark} branch [to advocate]{.mark} strongly
on behalf [of companies exporting]{.mark} defense items.]{.underline}

Webster, who was President Barack Obama's last director of international
cooperation at the Pentagon, called the policy "a major first step
toward improving government decision processes and policies." Aerospace
and defense firms rely on innovation and U.S. government support to
compete on a global scale, he noted.

The export council last month offered some 30 recommendations on how to
hardwire economic security and defense-industrial base considerations
into the government's international arms sale decisions.

"[[We appreciate the administration's outreach]{.mark} throughout this
process [and are pleased to see DAEC priorities]{.mark} in the plan,

Department of Commerce,]{.mark} which has a less onerous licensing
process and a smaller global footprint, [making it harder to track how
the weapons are ultimately used]{.mark} overseas.]{.underline}

The new rules come as efforts to strengthen gun control in the United
States, a key priority in the Obama administration, have stalled under
President Donald Trump despite continued mass shootings. Democrats have
signaled they plan to use their newfound control of the House of
Representatives to revisit the issue, starting with a House Judiciary
Committee hearing held Wednesday --- the first in about eight years.

The Trump administration first floated the changes last year,
rejuvenating a campaign to simplify export rules that had been
contemplated by the administration of President Barack Obama but then
dropped after the mass shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in
Newtown, Connecticut in 2012. The State Department sent the final
version of the rules to key lawmakers Monday as part of the mandatory
"congressional notification" process. The rules will take effect 30 days
later unless Congress takes the unlikely step of passing a resolution to
block them.

#### Trump loves Taiwan- relations are at an all time high, he would veto attempts to cut them off

**Jennings 3/27** (Ralph Jennings, writer for VOA covering Asia,
3-27-2019, \"Who's Behind the Quick Rise in US-Taiwan Relations,\" Voice
of America,

cliv

TAIPEI - Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen is scheduled to discuss her
government's foreign relations by video on a panel formed by the
Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based think tank. Diplomatic
agreements between the United States and China prohibit formal,
high-level Taiwan-U.S. encounters, and China is angered when it feels
the United States is edging away from its deal.

Yet the Taiwanese leader\'s participation comes as no surprise. Informal
[U.S.-Taiwan [relations have reached new highs under]{.mark} President
Donald [Trump]{.mark} over the past two years]{.underline}, and hundreds
of people in Congress, American think tanks and U.S.-based political
action committees have been laying a foundation for that resurgence in
relations.

China has claimed sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan since the Chinese
civil war of the 1940s and threatened to take it by force if needed.

U.S.-based Taiwan advocates, American as well as Taiwanese, work daily
with ideologically-motivated congress members to elevate Taiwan\'s
relations with the United States despite opposition from China \-- or
because of it -- observers say.

"I've never met a member of Congress who says 'I don't support Taiwan
issues,'" said Coen Blaauw, executive director of the Washington-based
Taiwan advocacy group Formosan Association for Public Relations. He
traveled to Taipei this week for meetings with senior Taiwanese ruling
party members.

To sell Taiwan, he said, "we have the product of Taiwan independence,
self-determination, and add to that, that also anti-China sentiment at
the moment in Washington D.C. is at an all-time high," Blaauw said.

Who's elevating Taiwan

Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party keeps a mission in the
United States and gets additional backing from the Formosan Association
for Public Affairs. At least two other groups act as political action
committees to raise funds or push people in the U.S. government, said
Huang Kwei-bo, vice dean of the international affairs college at
National Chengchi University.

The advocacy groups work closely with U.S. Congress members who prefer
Taiwan over China because it's democratic like the United States.

The Heritage Foundation, known for conservative public policy, is seen
as particularly pro-Taiwan. One chief peer is the policy incubator
Global Taiwan Institute. Think tanks invite powerful speakers to events
and publish research such as freedom rankings.

Congressional supporters

For people in Congress, "to suppress China's development, this is the
main goal, and of course for those in office now, whether or not they
have feelings for Taiwan, the historic record shows Taiwan is more
friendly," Huang said.

At least a half dozen U.S. senators and as many powerful people in the
House of Representatives actively push for stronger U.S.-Taiwan ties now
by introducing legislation or backing those bills in committee, Blaauw
said.

Congress approved last year a bill encouraging more high-level visits
based on a proposal by Sen. Marco Rubio. Cory Gardner, chairman of a
Senate subcommittee on East Asia relations, spearheaded 2018 legislation
to let the U.S. government downgrade relations with foreign governments
that break diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favor of China.

Steve Chabot, co-chairman of the House Congressional Taiwan Caucus,
introduced a resolution last week challenging Beijing's principle that
it should rule Taiwan.

Trump on board

Some U.S. presidents prioritize relations with China because of its
global economic weight, but they have all retained informal ties with
Taiwan since Washington severed formal relations in 1979.

[Congressional bills and lobbying [efforts are improving]{.mark}
U.S.-Taiwan [relations]{.mark} now [because Trump supports the
cause]{.mark},]{.underline} said Sean King, vice president of the Park
Strategies political consultancy in New York.

[The [government approved a \$1.42 billion sale of]{.mark} advanced
[weapons]{.mark} to Taiwan in 2017]{.underline}, enraging Beijing. It
has chastised China for "poaching" Taiwan's diplomatic allies, King
said. [[Trump and Tsai spoke by telephone]{.mark} in late
2016]{.underline}, after his election victory but before he took office.

Some of [[Trump's aides]{.mark} also happen to [like
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}. Before taking his current post, National
security adviser John [Bolton, argued for locating some U.S. troops from
a Japanese base to Taiwan. U.S. governments consider Taiwan one in a
chain of democratic friends in the Western Pacific.]{.underline}

Scholars say [[Trump favors Taiwan to remind China of his]{.mark}
country's broader geopolitical [influence]{.mark}]{.underline}. Beijing
and Washington have been locked in a thorny trade dispute since early
2018.

Tsai will probably "praise more connectivity with the United States"
during this week's panel discussion, said Alexander Huang, strategic
studies professor at Tamkang University in Taiwan.

"The U.S. public, media, academia and Congress have long been friendly
toward Taiwan," King said. "The difference now is the executive branch.
It all starts and ends at the top. [[When it comes to Taiwan, (Trump)
has so far been the strongest U.S. president]{.mark}]{.underline} in
recent memory."

The [[Trump]{.mark} administration has [approved selling]{.mark} Abrams
[tanks and]{.mark} Stinger [missiles to Taiwan, a major]{.mark}
potential [arms sale]{.mark}]{.underline} that is bound to irk Beijing
and comes as the administration seeks to negotiate a major trade
agreement with China.

[[Congress was notified]{.mark} Monday [that the State
Department]{.mark} had [approved both]{.mark} potential sales, which
include 108 M1A2T Abrams tanks, plus related equipment, and some 250
Stinger missiles.]{.underline}

Both types of equipment had been requested by Taiwan.

Taiwan\'s President Tsai Ing-wen said in March that the weaponry she had
requested from Washington would \"greatly enhance our land and air
capabilities, strengthen military morale and show to the world the US
commitment to Taiwan\'s defense.

In response, China\'s Defense Ministry said Beijing was \"firmly opposed
to US arms sales to Taiwan and US military contact with Taiwan.\"

The tanks are valued at up to \$2 billion while the portable
surface-to-air Stinger missiles are estimated to cost up to \$223
million.

The [Pentagon\'s Defense Security Cooperation Agency said that the [tank
sale serves \"US national, ]{.mark}]{.underline}economic, and security
[[interests]{.mark} by supporting\" Taiwan\'s \"continuing efforts to
modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive
capability.\"]{.underline} The agency also said that the Stinger missile
sale would improve the security and defensive capability of Taiwan,
which it called \"an important force for political stability, military
balance, and economic progress in the region.\"

Neither sale, the agency said, would \"alter the basic military balance
in the region.\"

While [the [US has]{.mark} long [provided arms to Taiwan as part of the
40-year-old T]{.mark}aiwan [R]{.mark}elations [A]{.mark}ct]{.underline},
Beijing has long chaffed at those sales.

\"Although China advocates for peaceful unification with Taiwan, China
has never renounced the use of military force, and continues to develop
and deploy advanced military capabilities needed for a potential
military campaign,\" a report from the Pentagon\'s Defense Intelligence
Agency warned in May.

The report also warned that Taiwan\'s traditional military advantages
over Beijing in the event of a cross-strait conflict were eroding in the
face of China\'s military modernization efforts.

\"Taiwan has historically enjoyed military advantages in the context of
a cross-Strait conflict, such as technological superiority and the
inherent geographic advantages of island defense, China\'s multi-decade
military modernization effort has eroded or negated many of these
advantages,\" the report added, saying that \"although Taiwan is taking
important steps to compensate for the growing disparities \... these
improvements only partially address Taiwan\'s declining defensive
advantages.\"

[[Since 2010, the US has announced]{.mark} more than [\$15 billion in

#### Trump has routinized sales to Taiwan- they are popular, Trump would veto

**New Delhi Times 7/20** (New Delhi Times Bureau, 7-20-2019, \"US Moving
to Make Arms Sales to Taiwan More Routine ,\" New Delhi Times,
<https://www.newdelhitimes.com/us-moving-to-make-arms-sales-to-taiwan-more-routine/>)
cliv

A U.S. government arms sale to Taiwan often starts with a quiet request
from Taipei, which wants new weapons for its defense against the
stronger China. Then the U.S. Department of Defense deliberates for
months or more whether to recommend the sale to Congress. This process
has no set schedule, frustrating for Taiwan, and China fumes at any
approved sales.

Now a [U.S. assistant secretary of defense]{.underline} for Asia [has a
proposal]{.underline} to end this cycle of suspense and anger over arms
sales that dates back some four decades. Some [[analysts say the]{.mark}
new [scheme is]{.mark} already [in motion]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Washington will "treat Taiwan as a normal security systems
partner]{.underline}]{.mark}," Asia-Pacific Assistant Secretary Randall
Schriver told a Heritage Foundation think tank event in June. That means
[[arms sales]{.mark} could [become more routine]{.mark}]{.underline},
eliminating suspense that hangs over Taiwan and China during the waits.

"[Routinizing U.S. arms sales to Taiwan would mean [selling arms to
Taiwan when needed, when approved and ready]{.mark},]{.underline} and
not holding them to sell all at once at a time thought less likely to
offend Beijing," said Sean King, vice president of Park Strategies
political consultancy in New York.

"In other words, [U.S. arms sales to Taiwan wouldn't be held political
hostage to the constant ebbs and flows in U.S.-PRC]{.underline}
\[People's Republic of China\] [relations]{.underline}," he said.

Cycle of suspense and rage

[[Washington's July 8 approval of a \$2.2 billion arms package was the
latest]{.mark} one-off case]{.underline} that angered China. After the
State Department told Congress it wanted to sell 108 American-made M1A2T
Abrams tanks and 250 Stinger missiles to Taiwan, Chinese officials
demanded the sale's cancellation and said it would sever ties with any
companies involved.

China sees self-ruled Taiwan as part of its territory rather than a
state entitled to its own defense. It resents other countries,
especially the United States as the world's top military power, for
selling arms to Taiwan.

Taiwan's foreign ministry said July 9 it "welcomed" the \$2.2 billion
sale, which had been pending since Taiwan made requests for weapons in
March. But the island government had also hoped the deal would include
new F-16 fighter planes to replace today's aging fleet.

Adding to Taiwan's suspense, former U.S. President Barack [Obama had
paused sales announcements for as long as two years]{.underline}, said
Alexander Huang, strategic studies professor at Tamkang University in
Taiwan. [President Donald [Trump]{.mark}'s administration [has announced
four packages since 2017]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"For a long time, the way to process the arms sales have been a
political headache in different forms for many years under many
different American administrations," Huang said.

Schriver probably hopes to process sales regardless of "timing" or any
pressure from China to spike a sale, he said. Today's sales, he added,
are granted "case by case" partly based on the extent of China's likely
backlash.

New normal for Taiwan?

Schriver did not elaborate on how [[Washington would make Taiwan a more
normal arms client]{.mark}, but [analysts forecast more of what
Trump]{.mark}'s government [has]{.mark} already
[done]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"[My personal view is that [U.S. arms sales to Taiwan have already
become routine, over the past year or two]{.mark}]{.underline}," said
David An, senior research fellow with the Washington, D.C.-based policy
consultancy Global Taiwan Institute.

The new way of business means approving or rejecting each Taiwan arms
request on its own merit within about three months, An said. Past U.S.
administrations, he said, would let requests accumulate and then approve
them all together once or twice a year.

"[It's already happening]{.underline}," said Andrew Yang,
secretary-general of the Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies in
Taiwan. "Now it's the Indo-Pacific assistant secretary, he strongly
supports this new approach, and I think [this is going to be the
direction for the future."]{.underline}

China will still get mad, Yang said, but there's "nothing they can do
about it" if the sales are U.S. "policy." Washington will ultimately
ignore Chinese pressure, he said.

The U.S. [[House]{.mark} of Representatives [backed resolutions]{.mark}
on Wednesday [to block the sale of]{.mark} precision-guided
[munitions]{.mark} to Saudi Arabia and t]{.underline}he United Arab
Emirates, sending them to the White House, where [President Donald
[Trump has promised a veto]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Nearly a month after the Senate supported 22 resolutions disapproving of
Trump's plan for billions of dollars in weapons sales despite Congress'
objections, the House passed three of the 22, two on a vote of 238-190
and the third by a 237-190 margin, largely along party lines.

The [[three resolutions would block the sale of Raytheon Co
precision-guided munitions]{.mark} and related equipment to the two
countries]{.underline}. The House's Democratic leaders opted to take up
those three before the others because the PGMs could be delivered
quickly, aides said. Some lawmakers also suspect that the PGMs have been
used against civilians in Yemen's civil war.

Many members of Congress, including some of [Trump's fellow [Republicans
as well as Democrats, have been]{.mark} [frustrated by]{.mark} what they
see as [Trump's embrace]{.mark} of Saudi Arabia]{.underline}.

The Senate's backing of the resolutions of disapproval was one of the
few times the Republican-led chamber has opposed his foreign policy.

Lawmakers want Washington to push the kingdom to improve its human
rights record and do more to avoid civilian casualties in the
four-year-long war in Yemen, where the Saudis and UAE are leading an air
campaign against Iran-backed Houthi rebels.

Frustration grew after the murder at a Saudi consulate in Turkey last
year of Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi,
a U.S. resident.

"This is a strong message, I think, that our values must guide our
foreign policy," said Representative Eliot Engel, the Democratic
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, urging support for the
resolutions before the vote.

[Trump wants to retain close ties to Riyadh, which he considers an
important partner in the Middle East and counterweight to the influence
of Iran.]{.underline}

Trump also views foreign military sales as a way to generate U.S. jobs.
Officials from his administration had been unhappy with Democrats in
Congress who blocked the planned sales, in some cases for more than a
year, over civilian casualties in Yemen.

[[Trump announced]{.mark} in May that [he would sidestep congressional
review of the military deals]{.mark}, worth more than \$8 billion, by
declaring that the threat from Iran constituted an
emergency]{.underline}.

Tensions with Iran have decreased since then, and administration
officials have acknowledged that the military equipment has not been
delivered.

Several Republicans joined Democrats in condemning that decision and
voting for the resolutions. However, they would have to attract far more
support in both the Republican-led Senate and House to garner the
two-thirds majorities needed to override Trump's vetoes.

But lawmakers from both parties are not dropping the matter. Several
pieces of legislation making their way through Congress include
Saudi-related provisions.

And the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is due to vote on two
Saudi-related bills on Tuesday. One, sponsored by seven Republican and
Democratic senators, includes sanctions to support a peaceful resolution
of the Yemen war, address the humanitarian crisis and hold perpetrators
responsible for murdering Khashoggi.

The other would mandate an in-depth review of U.S.-Saudi policy and bar
travel to the United States by many members of the Saudi royal family.

Third Veto"

cliv

WASHINGTON --- The [[House gave final passage]{.mark} on Wednesday
[to]{.mark} a series of [measures that would block the sale of billions
of dollars of arms]{.mark} to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates,
[sending to]{.mark} President [Trump a]{.mark} fresh [rebuke of his
administration's efforts to circumvent Congress]{.mark}]{.underline} to
help Persian Gulf allies prosecute a disastrous war in Yemen.

A scattering of [[Republicans]{.mark} and the House's lone independent,
Justin Amash of Michigan, [joined]{.mark} [Democrats in three
back-to-back votes]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} submitting for the
record their stewing anger at Mr. Trump's resolute support of Saudi
Arabia and his use of emergency powers to sidestep Congress, this time
with a declaration of an emergency over Iran.

"If the administration wants to sell these weapons, they should follow
the law --- not misuse it --- and come to Congress," said Representative
Eliot L. Engel, the New York Democrat who is the chairman of the Foreign
Affairs Committee. The Iran emergency, he continued, was "phony" and
devised "to trample on this body's constitutional duties."

It is the second time in recent months that Congress has passed
bipartisan legislation condemning the administration's relationship with
Saudi Arabia. Lawmakers in both parties have been incensed that the
president has done nothing to punish the kingdom for the grisly killing
of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident and Virginia-based Washington Post
columnist, even after the Central Intelligence Agency concluded that
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing.

In April, lawmakers voted to end American military involvement in Saudi
Arabia's war in Yemen by invoking the rarely used War Powers Act of
1973, only to see Mr. Trump veto the resolution.

No other foreign policy issue has created as large a rift between the
president and Congress, and the vote to block the arms sales deepens the
divide. But the [[outrage]{.mark} on Capitol Hill [has limits]{.mark},
particularly in the president's own party. The [measures
approved]{.mark} on Wednesday, and already passed by the Senate, [are
likely to meet the same fate]{.mark} as the resolution to end military
support to the war in Yemen: [death by veto]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Republicans are unlikely to provide enough votes to override what would
be Mr. Trump's third veto of his presidency.

The White House announced the munitions sales in May, invoking an
emergency provision in the Arms Export Control Act to allow American
companies to sell \$8.1 billion worth of munitions in 22 pending
transfers. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are waging an air
war in Yemen that has come under sharp criticism from Congress and human
rights organizations. A State Department official, R. Clarke Cooper,
testified before the Senate last week that the munitions had yet to be
delivered, nearly 50 days after the emergency had been declared.

In our video, a former State Department official sent to advise the
Saudi-led coalition says he saw firsthand how it failed to avoid
civilian casualties in Yemen --- and how the U.S. chose to look the
other way.

Members of Congress from both parties had been holding up arms sales
from American companies to Persian Gulf nations and trying to end United
States military support for the Saudi-led coalition that is fighting the
Houthi rebels in Yemen, which has resulted in what the United Nations
calls the world's worst man-made humanitarian disaster. But by declaring
an emergency over Iran, a move that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
pushed hard for, the administration was able to blow through lawmakers'
holds and the 30-day review period Congress normally receives to examine
a sale.

The [US [House]{.mark} of Representatives on Wednesday [sided with the
Senate in passing three resolutions to ban sales of]{.mark}
precision-guided [munitions and other weaponry]{.mark} and technology
[to Saudi Arabia, the U]{.mark}nited [A]{.mark}rab [E]{.mark}mirates and
Jordan]{.underline}.

[[A majority of lawmakers approved three resolutions aimed at blocking
exports]{.mark} of defense weapons and services to Saudi Arabia, the
UAE, Jordan and some European nations [without congressional
approval]{.mark}]{.underline}. The resolutions cover only three of the
22 deals announced by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo back in May and
focus specifically on the sale of precision-guided munitions like
Raytheon's Paveway bombs, the main source of concern for lawmakers. Four
Republicans broke ranks to vote for the motions, while there were no
detractors among Democrats, who were joined by one independent.

[Still, [the figure is not enough to override]{.mark} US President
Donald [Trump's looming veto]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In three separate statements on Tuesday, the Trump administration said
that the transfer of the weapons and technology that would allow Saudi
Arabia to manufacture the fusing elements for the precision-guided bombs
on its soil "directly supports the foreign policy and national security
objectives of the United States." Justifying the sale, the White House
said that Riyadh "serves as a bulwark against Iran and its proxies'
malign activities in the region," arguing that along with additional US
training, the "provision of precision-guided munitions would further
help the Saudis mitigate the risk of civilian casualties."

So far, however, the reality on the ground in Yemen has been very
different, given the well-documented history of US-made weapons being
used to obliterate civilians there, such as a school full of children in
August last year.

With its vote, [the House follows in the Senate's footsteps that last
month passed 22 disapproval resolutions of its own, one for each deal.
Trump's decision to sidestep Congress and invoke emergency powers to
clear some \$8.1 billion in arms sales to the US\' Arab allies has
sparked major backlash, with some Republicans]{.underline}, most
prominently Trump's staunch ally Lindsey Graham (South Carolina),
voicing their opposition.

The opponents of the sales argue that there is no ongoing emergency that
would have justified such a move in circumvention of the established
procedure, which requires Congress to approve major military transfers.
However, while some Republicans took issue with the Trump
administration's decision, the overwhelming majority stood behind the
president. The House Homeland Security Committee's top Republican, Rep.
Michael McCaul, (R-Texas) argued on Tuesday that the sales were an
essential part of "a larger effort to deter Iran."

Two resolutions were passed after winning 238 votes, while the third
with 237 votes. The resolutions were passed primarily by Democrats with

The three resolutions could cancel arms sales contracts related to

Notably, the USMCA does not resolve the fate of Trump's worldwide steel

exports). Lighthizer told a Senate panel in July that a revised NAFTA
would include lifting the tariffs on metals from both nations, but on
Monday he said that it would occur in a later phase of negotiations. For
many American industries, the future benefit of USMCA will not make up

\-\--Public + GOP are skeptical, so they'll seize on small mis-steps and

**Blake, 16** -- Aaron Blake, senior political reporter for The Fix,

<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/28/donald-trumps-political-mandate-is-historically-small/?utm_term=.17598a54d259>

It's unusually petty and strange for a president-elect to do this, yes.
But there is actually good reason for Trump to be concerned about his
share of the popular vote. After all, the current tabulation suggests
that [53.5 percent of Americans cast ballots for someone not
named]{.underline} Donald [Trump, and [politicians are]{.mark} generally
[stronger when they have **demonstrated**]{.mark} **popular
[support]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[That translates to]{.mark}
**[p]{.mark}**olitical **[c]{.mark}**apital [and an]{.mark} easier time
pursuing your [agenda]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [It
makes]{.underline}]{.mark} your [[opponents]{.mark} --- and]{.underline}
perhaps even [skeptical]{.underline} congressional
[Republicans]{.underline}, in Trump's case --- [[less likely to **stand
in your way**]{.underline}]{.mark}. ([Witness]{.underline} President
[Obama's mandate in the wake of]{.underline} the [2008]{.underline}
election, [for example]{.underline}.)

[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}, though, [[has a **historically small
mandate**]{.underline}]{.mark}. And if you compare his election to the
57 previous presidential votes, that reality begins to come into clearer
focus.

As of now, [Trump's deficit in the popular vote]{.underline} --- 1.7
points --- [is the third-largest]{.underline} on record [for an election
winner and the second-biggest for an electoral college
winner]{.underline}. The only bigger deficits came in the 19th century,
when Rutherford B. Hayes won the 1876 election by one(!) electoral vote
despite losing the popular vote by three points, and when John Quincy
Adams was declared the winner by the House of Representatives despite
losing the electoral vote and the popular vote to Andrew Jackson by more
than 10 points. (It was a crowded race, and Jackson was shy of a
majority of electoral votes.)

Trump is also taking less of the popular vote --- 46.5 percent --- than
all but seven previous winners. That number is likely to creep down
closer to 46 percent as the remaining votes get counted, but he is still
likely to finish eighth from the bottom (next lowest is Grover Cleveland
in 1892 at 46.02 percent).

Among those seven winners who took less of the popular vote, though, six
faced a third-party candidate who was formidable enough to actually win
a state, and the seventh was Bill Clinton, who also faced a formidable
third-party candidate --- Ross Perot --- who took 19 percent of the
national vote but didn\'t quite carry a state. Clinton took just 43
percent of the vote but won the popular vote by six points over ~~Bob
Dole~~ George H.W. Bush.

The strongest third-party showing in the 2016 election was from
Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson, who is taking slightly more than 3
percent of the vote right now. The worst third-party showing in any of
the other races was 8.5 percent, which is what Populist Party candidate
James B. Weaver took in 1892 as a regional candidate who won five
Western states. The leading third-party candidate in every other race
won at least double digits.

In other words, there was far less splitting up of the vote in the 2016
election than in the seven elections that produced a winner with a
smaller share of the vote. While those seven candidacies can all
credibly point to a third-party candidate diluting the vote, Trump
really can't. Yes, Johnson set a record for a Libertarian candidate's
share of the vote, but he was ultimately a non-factor in the race.

[[Does that mean Trump is sunk]{.mark} as president[?]{.mark} Of course

indicator]{.underline} of that [will be his approval
rating]{.underline}, which hasn't been measured since he won the
election. His favorable rating --- which is more about his personal
appeal than job performance --- bumped up after his election but still
stood at just 42 percent, according to Gallup. That's lower than any
president-elect on record and is notably less even than his 46.5 percent
of the vote.

[But for now, [Trump's]{.mark} political [mandate
is]{.mark}]{.underline} very, [**[very small]{.underline}**. [He
will]{.underline}]{.mark} probably [[**succeed** in getting
**some**]{.mark} of his [priorities through Congress]{.mark} thanks to
the GOP's congressional majorities, [but the American people are
skeptical]{.mark}]{.underline} of their president-elect, even as they
elected him president.

The popular vote doesn't technically matter when it come to electing
presidents, but [popular appeal **does matter** when it comes to how
presidents can govern]{.underline}. And the idea that a majority of
Americans still don't like our president-elect is eating at Trump --- as
it probably should.

"If personnel is the beginning of policy, we believe that [he's laying
the groundwork to shake up a lot of the Washington
establishment]{.underline} and the bureaucracy of the federal
government," Head said.

Vander Plaats expects Trump to follow through on his commitment to
appoint conservative Supreme Court justices and repeal the Johnson
Amendment, which bars churches and other tax-exempt organizations from
engaging in political campaigns.

"[[Once]{.mark} the President [Trump]{.mark}]{.underline} --- versus
President-elect Trump --- [and the Congress [is working]{.mark} and he's
in administrative mode]{.underline}, I think the
[[people]{.underline}]{.mark}, his base, others, they
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} find ways to [[remind
him]{.underline}]{.mark} of 'hey, [this was a promise, we expect you [to

[[they're]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[gonna give

his own leadership [right now]{.mark}]{.underline}. I think most of us
know this country needs to be turned around, and we're hoping and
praying that he can deliver on turning this country around."

[Tyler]{.underline}, the former Cruz spokesman, [used economic terms to
convey his message to [Trump]{.mark} and the fine line he's
walking]{.underline}.

"[He]{.underline} basically [[has a surplus of]{.mark}
**[p]{.mark}**olitical **[c]{.mark}**apital in his base.

[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} Kinney 1995; Eshbaugh-Soha 2005, 2010). While

Programs", August 2015, Legislative Studies Quarterly, 40:3

[[The president's legislative program]{.underline}]{.mark},1 which is
the set of proposals sent from the president to the legislative branch,
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} viewed as [**[pivotal]{.underline}** [in
presidential-congressional relations]{.underline}]{.mark}. We see
evidence of the privileged place these requests have in three ways.
First, [[they **shape Congress's**]{.mark} **lawmaking
[agenda]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Over 70% of]{.mark} the
president's]{.underline} issue [[priorities get]{.mark} congressional
[consideration, and]{.mark} significant
[legislation]{.mark}]{.underline} sent by the administration [[is
**almost always debated**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Edwards and Barrett
2000; Peterson 1990). Second, [these policy [proposals
are]{.mark}]{.underline} traditionally viewed as [[a
tool]{.underline}]{.mark} the president can use [[to **open**]{.mark}
**policy [windows]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and **create**]{.mark} **more

Kingdon reports that "[no other single actor in the political system
has]{.underline} quite [the capability of [the president]{.mark} to
**set agendas**]{.underline} in given policy areas\..." (1984, 23).
Third, [these proposals [provide **cues to
legislators**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[about]{.mark} which [issues they
can **successfully politicize** by opposing or supporting the
president's]{.mark} policy [ideas]{.mark}]{.underline} (Lee 2009).

As [[the president's program]{.underline}]{.mark} heavily influences
legislative attention and the level of partisanship within Congress, it
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [**[crucial]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} [understanding [the broader policymaking

select some issues to promote in their legislative agenda and not
others.

#### Trump PC [shapes agenda]{.underline} through [public pressure]{.underline} and the [news cycle]{.underline}

**Catanese, 16** -- David Catanese, Senior Politics Writer for U.S. News
& World Report, 12-8-2016, "With Rallies and Tweets, Trump Reshaping the
Bully Pulpit",
http://www.usnews.com/news/the-run-2016/articles/2016-12-08/donald-trump-builds-a-new-bully-pulpit-with-rallies-tweets

Donald [[Trump]{.mark} is]{.underline} still six weeks from his
Inauguration Day, and yet he\'s [already signaling he[\'ll]{.mark}
**[expand the]{.mark} presidential [bully pulpit]{.mark}** to bounds not
seen before]{.underline}. [This week]{.underline} alone, the
president-elect is [holding [rallies]{.mark} in three battleground
states]{.underline} -- North Carolina, Iowa and Michigan -- as part of
his \"Thank you\" tour.

But these [rallies]{.underline} -- which look, sound and feel
indistinguishable from his campaign events -- [are about much more
than]{.underline} simply offering [thanks]{.underline}. [They appear
purposefully designed to portray Trump as a perpetual
victor]{.underline}. He\'s placed squarely [inside a reaffirming venue
that\'s used]{.underline} as a vehicle [to champion even the smallest of
successes]{.underline}, and [to [push]{.mark} and press [forward
his]{.mark} unconventional [ideas]{.mark}]{.underline} before adoring
fans.

[[To]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[members of
[Congress]{.mark}]{.underline}** watching from their television screens
and Twitter feeds on Capitol Hill, [[it\'s a **constant**]{.mark} and
powerful **[reminder]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that [the masses are with
him]{.mark}. And [these]{.mark} events [are]{.mark}]{.underline} more
[likely]{.underline} than not to remain [[a **permanent
fixture**]{.mark} of his presidency]{.underline}.

\"What [[it]{.underline}]{.mark} does is [[assist him]{.mark} with
**[communicating]{.mark}** and **laying out [his
agenda]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [It helps **build
momentum**]{.underline}]{.mark} [for that agenda]{.underline}. [People
are]{.underline} just [loving these. He didn\'t win and go into
hiding]{.underline},\" says Rep. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, who
serves on Trump\'s transition team. \"[[It will]{.mark}
help]{.underline} to **[[put]{.underline}]{.mark}** some [**[pressure on
Congress]{.underline}** [to move swiftly. 2017 is not going to
be]{.underline}]{.mark} [a [usual]{.mark}]{.underline},
standard-operating-procedure [year in Washington]{.underline}, D.C.\"

Take Trump\'s Tuesday night event in Fayetteville, North Carolina, home
of Fort Bragg, the largest military base in the U.S. by population.
Trump used it to formally unveil his selection for secretary of defense,
retired Marine Gen. James \"Mad Dog\" Mattis.

\"Mad Dog plays no games, right?\" Trump crowed.

Because he\'s only been retired for three years, Mattis will need a
special waiver from Congress in order to bypass a law that prohibits
recent active officers from serving as secretary of defense.

Before thousands of supporters still waving campaign placards, Trump
applied his case.

\"If he didn\'t get that waiver, there\'d be a lot of angry people,\"
Trump said. \"Such a popular choice.\"

It\'s just one example of how [Trump is transferring]{.underline} the
[energy from his campaign to governance]{.underline}.

\"**[[He\'s a performance artist]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [That\'s what
he does for a living]{.underline}. Performers must perform. [He feeds
off]{.underline} the [crowds]{.underline}, he [gathers]{.underline} his
[strength and momentum from them]{.underline}. I doubt he\'ll suddenly
switch that light off, because he may feel unalive,\" says Douglas
Brinkley, a presidential historian and professor at Rice University.
\"He won\'t make a differentiation between campaigning and governing --
it\'s still all the Donald Trump show. He has a winning formula right
now.

\"Why change courses in midstream because people say other presidents
haven\'t done that?\"

What may get in the way of Trump\'s perpetual roadshow is the
responsibilities of governing. A [foreign policy crisis]{.underline}. A
heightened national security threat. A [budget battle]{.underline}.
These [are]{.underline} all nearly [inevitable instances that require a
president to huddle and strategize in person with his
advisers]{.underline}.

[But this is where Trump\'s second specialized weapon comes into play:
his **Twitter** account]{.underline}.

While Obama became the first president to tweet in 2015, his miniature
missives generally have been formal, banal and forgettable. Trump\'s
tweets are the exact opposite, and there\'s no mistake about who\'s
drafting them. They\'re spontaneous, humorous and often substantive,
though the veracity of their substance has been called into question on
multiple occasions.

[Trump\'s [tweets]{.mark} already [are **driving**]{.mark} **cable
[news]{.mark} coverage**, **[molding policy]{.mark}** and placing
opponents on notice]{.underline}. For instance, just this week he\'s
used his account to attack China\'s currency devaluation and activity in
the South China Sea, propose canceling a plan for Boeing to produce a
new Air Force One, and attack the head of a United Steelworkers branch.

[The ability to singularly drive a news cycle from the palm of his hand
is]{.underline} going to be [[a new phenomenon that]{.mark} will
**[test]{.mark} the [traditional]{.mark} roles of
[policymaking]{.mark}**]{.underline} and journalism.

Yet there are some who believe the novelty of Trump\'s tweets eventually
will wear off.

\"He\'s got tremendous political capital now, but he\'s burning through
it with tweets. You use these tweets too frequently and they\'re going
to lose all force. It becomes entertainment, not persuasion,\" says Paul
Light, a professor of public service at New York University.

That wasn\'t true of the campaign, however, when Trump\'s tweets were
often the dominant topic of conversation, for better or for worse.

With Trump reducing the number of interviews he grants and not having
held a press conference in months, his tweets have become the prime
conduit to the president-elect\'s mind. News organizations have little
choice but to track them.

\"[The new reality is]{.underline} Donald [Trump\'s tweets are going to
be running the news cycle. It\'s not going to stop]{.underline},\"
Brinkley says. \"[It\'s [a **new form of
governing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Some people will find it tacky and
crass. Others will say it\'s a clever way to go over Washington, D.C.,
officialdom and speak directly to the American people. It\'s going to
make the press conference and pool reporters antiquated.\"

He adds, \"It\'s almost like Confucius spreading strange wisdom. [Every
day]{.underline} he\'s pumping verbage into our news cycle and [[he\'s
able to]{.mark} control]{.underline} -- with the number of characters,
using choice words -- to goad [people]{.underline}, get under people\'s
skin, seek revenge [and **[move policy]{.mark} forward [in his
direction]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\"

[Taken together, Trump\'s [**megarallies and tweetstorms** are]{.mark}
already **[ushering in a reimagined]{.mark} presidential
[pulpit]{.mark}**]{.underline}, one [that plays to his strength of pithy
performance art laced with dashes of suspense]{.underline}.

#### PC real and ensures passage\-\--it's key to [both]{.underline} the left [and]{.underline} right

\-\--GOP reps can only buck Trump so many times, or they'll lose
primaries

\-\--Trump PC effective with red/purple state Dems

**Cusack, 16** -- Bob Cusack, The Hill, 11-23-2016, "Trump's new weapon?
The bully pulpit",
http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/307194-trumps-new-weapon-the-bully-pulpit

[[Trump showed he **isn\'t shy**]{.mark} **in [going after]{.mark}
members of [his own party]{.mark}** through]{.underline}out
[the]{.underline} 2016 [presidential cycle]{.underline}. And that
probably won\'t change in 2017 and 2018.

[The]{.underline} conservative-leaning House [Freedom Caucus
and]{.underline} outside [[right-wing groups are wary of
Trump\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} \$1 trillion [infrastructure
[proposal]{.mark}]{.underline} and want the 45th president to focus on
reducing the nation\'s record debt levels. The Freedom Caucus was
instrumental in pushing former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) out the
door, [[but picking a fight with Trump is **another thing**]{.mark}
**entirely**]{.underline}. Most
[[R]{.mark}epublican[s]{.mark}]{.underline} in the House don\'t worry
about their November election --- they [[worry about]{.mark} their
[primaries. And **crossing Trump** could risk]{.mark} a [**challenge
from the right** in]{.mark} the [2018]{.mark} cycle]{.underline}.

Speaker Paul [[Ryan]{.underline}]{.mark} (R-Wis.) [[and
Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} feuded in 2016, but in the name of party
unity and policy, they have [[put aside]{.mark} their
[differences]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [And]{.underline}]{.mark} in a
related development, [Ryan\'s [approval]{.mark}]{.underline} rating just
[[hit an **all-time high**]{.mark} **earlier this month**]{.underline}.

After the election, Ryan said it\'s time for the Republican Party to "go
big" and "bold." Trump wouldn\'t have it any other way, though [[there
are]{.mark} inherent [**risks** with an **aggressive strategy** without
a supermajority]{.mark} in the Senate]{.underline}.

Republicans who publicly ripped Trump are now getting in line, so
muscling big-ticket items through the upper chamber using budget
reconciliation shouldn\'t be that challenging. Those bills, such as
ObamaCare repeal, would only need 51 Senate votes to pass. But replacing
ObamaCare, building a wall along the southern border and clearing a
Supreme Court nominee will necessitate 60 votes.

That's where [[**Trump\'s bully pulpit will come in**, **calling out
Dem**]{.mark}**ocrat[s]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} both [red and purple
states]{.mark} that [he won]{.mark} on Election Day]{.underline}.

While Trump may not be up to speed on the nuances of the legislative
process, those mechanics will be handled by Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell (R-Ky.) and Ryan.

Still, [[the **fate of pending bills**]{.underline}]{.mark} isn\'t
decided by tactics. It [[comes down to **marketing and political
muscle**]{.mark}, which **play to [Trump\'s
strengths]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Trump will surely have a slew of critics]{.underline} of anything he
wants to do. They will throw everything they have to kill his agenda.

Trump\'s likely response: "This bill will help make America great again.
It should be passed as soon as possible."

Democrats will need to step up their messaging game to thwart Trump\'s
agenda. Sen. Charles [[Schumer]{.underline}]{.mark} (D-N.Y.), who will
be minority leader next year, had [[pledged to work with Trump]{.mark}
on areas of common ground]{.underline}. He has also vowed to battle
Trump when warranted, most notably on attempts to eradicate Obama\'s
legacy laws.

### a2: trump pc fails

#### Trump knows how to use PC - he's got key leverage and effective bargaining skills

<http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-will-play-congress-like-a-fiddle-2017-01-03>

[[Trump will play Congress like a fiddle New president will bargain, not
rubber-stamp]{.underline}]{.mark} Republican agenda The full scope of
Hillary Clinton's loss and Donald Trump's victory will become apparent
this week as the newly elected Congress convenes. We all know the
[[Republicans swept the elections]{.underline}]{.mark}, winning the
White House and retaining control of both houses of Congress. But it is
where these victories came from and how they were made that tells us
what will happen in the two years this 115th Congress will have until
midterm elections in 2018. [[There is obviously a great deal of overlap
between Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark} campaign [[pledges and the standing
agenda of congressional Republicans]{.underline}]{.mark} under House
Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. But there
are also some significant differences --- in the approach to trade
issues and deficit spending, to name just two. Trump's pledge to
maintain and defend Medicare and Social Security is another important
difference. Congressional Republicans may think they are about to reach
the Promised Land, and Washington Post reporter David Weigel this week
neatly summed up the various bills they have vetted on issues from
deregulation to repealing Obamacare that are just waiting for a
president to sign into law. But if Trump has proven anything in his
idiosyncratic campaign, it is that he is hardly just "a Republican with
enough working digits to handle a pen" --- the ideal president once
dreamed of by tax reform activist Grover Norquist. In other words, it's
not likely Trump will simply rubber-stamp legislation that a Republican
Congress churns out. Why would someone who trumpets his expertise in
negotiation simply give Congress what it wants? [[He will hold back
on]{.underline}]{.mark} those [[signatures as **leverage to get what he
want**s]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially when it runs counter to or
simply beyond the lawmakers' agenda. Salena Zito, a pro-Trump
commentator who catapulted to prominence for her insights into the Trump
campaign, reminds us that the key to understanding the incoming
president is his 1987 book, "The Art of the Deal." Trump voters
understood what mainstream media commentators still haven't grasped ---
[[many of his statements are]{.underline}]{.mark} not ex cathedra
pronouncements on policies but **[[negotiating
ploys]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And, yes, many of them are not completely
true. "Throughout the book, he is always negotiating, no matter if he
was coming from a full truth or not, didn't matter," Zito writes of the
1987 book in the Washington Examiner. "It is always about the value of
what is at stake. In that type of barter, truthfulness becomes
irrelevant, it only has actuality if the deal is struck and the facts
come out." Which brings us back to Congress and how Trump will deal with
it. Even though Republicans retained control of both houses, Democrats
trimmed those majorities even as Clinton won a commanding plurality in
the popular vote for president. The Republican majority in the Senate
went to 52 from 54, out of 100, and to 241 from 247, out of 435 in the
House. The electoral upsets that enabled Republicans to maintain the
Senate majority were the victories of Ron Johnson in Wisconsin and Pat
Toomey in Pennsylvania, two Republican incumbents most pollsters
predicted would lose to Democratic challengers, Russ Feingold and
Kathleen McGinty. But Trump's surprising win in those swing states also
lifted the two incumbents to an unexpected victory. Had Clinton's
campaign in those states been slightly more effective she might be the
president-elect with Democratic control of the Senate. Democrats were
bound to recapture the Senate seat in Illinois, but they also won a
closely fought battle in New Hampshire, where the popular governor,
Maggie Hassan, defeated Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte. It may well
have been Ayotte's disavowal of Trump that cost her the margin of
victory. The lesson here, as with unsuccessful Nevada Senate candidate
Joe Heck, who lost ground after distancing himself from Trump, is that
[[Republican lawmakers **need Trump's support to gain voter favor** more
than he needs them.]{.mark}]{.underline} The picture from the House
results is a little less clear-cut. Although every member is up for
re-election every two years, the rate of incumbency victories is very
high. In 2016, 380 of the 393 incumbents seeking re-election won, for an
incumbency rate of 96.7%. According to Ballotpedia, Democrats tend to
gain seats in presidential election years with their higher voter
turnout, while Republicans tend to gain in the midterm elections. For
instance, Democrats gained eight sets in 2012 and 24 in 2008, which make
the net gain of six in 2016 seem relatively small. So Republicans are
likely to make gains in the House [[in 2018]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the
Senate, Republicans will be defending only eight seats, while
[[Democrats will be defending]{.underline}]{.mark} 25 --- 10 of which
are [[in states]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[Trump
won]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Those 10 Democratic senators will be **very
careful about thwarting Trump**, which **makes his leverage in the
Senate considerably larger**]{.underline}]{.mark} than the 52
Republicans. Trump may be a political novice, but if [he's]{.underline}
half as [skillful at negotiation]{.underline} as he claims to be, [he
will quickly grasp how to play the legislature like a
fiddle.]{.underline}

#### Trump knows how to use PC effectively, but its finite and drained by major fights over external policies

**Collinson, 17\-\--**Stephen, political columnist at CNN, 1/4,
<http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/03/politics/donald-trump-republicans-congress/>

[[Trump throws weight around]{.mark} Washington]{.underline} Donald
Trump isn\'t even in Washington yet, but he\'s already throwing his
weight around. [The President-elect **[prevailed]{.mark}**]{.underline}
Tuesday in the first exchange of what could turn out to be an awkward,
sometimes turbulent relationship [[with fellow Republicans]{.mark} on
Capitol Hill.]{.underline} A full-blown PR disaster threatened to derail
the first day of the new Congress as House Republicans prepared to move
forward with a measure that would have gutted an independent ethics
office. As the scope of the controversy became clear by mid-morning,
[Trump threw cold water on the plan]{.underline}, calling the ethics
watchdog \"unfair,\" but [[suggesting there were bigger
priorities]{.mark} for lawmakers to tackle]{.underline}. \"With all that
Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of
the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it \... may be, their
number one act and priority,\" Trump said in consecutive tweets. \"Focus
on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater
importance!\" Within hours, House GOP lawmakers met in an emergency
session and decided unanimously to remove the ethics provisions from a
broader package slated for a vote later in the day. [[The episode was
the first test of Trump\'s **ability to exert influence over his
party**]{.mark} **in Congress**.]{.underline} It\'s unclear whether
Trump\'s tweets were the sole deciding factor in the GOP\'s flip or
whether lawmakers were responding to intense pressure from constituents.
A brief history of the House GOP\'s failed ethics ploy Either way, it\'s
certain the blowback intensified to a new level once Trump turned to
Twitter. Rep. Steve King of Iowa, who backed the attempt to gut the
ethics panel that many lawmakers believe overreaches, said Trump\'s
comment \"animated the press\" and created pressure on GOP lawmakers to
change course. \"I\'m concerned that now we have Republicans criticizing
Republicans,\" King said. \"We need to stay away from that.\" Some
lawmakers said they decided independently their move was unwise and
didn\'t need Trump to tell them. [Perception in Washington]{.underline}
But [in a sense, it does not matter. The [perception quickly jelled in
Washington that Trump put himself at the center of the storm and changed

The GOP wrangle was not Trump\'s only win on Tuesday. Ford announced it

the move. Democrats will argue that such interventions pale into
comparison to the millions of jobs created by President Barack Obama.

our North American partners is an important step toward
**[stabiliz]{.mark}ing a [struggling farm economy]{.mark}** and the No.
1 legislative priority for corn farmers this year.]{.underline} This is
why corn farmers from across the country are taking to Capitol Hill this
week. They're laying the groundwork for a concerted effort by U.S.
agriculture producers to ratify the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade
Agreement (USMCA). [[USMCA]{.mark} will solidify a \$3.2 billion export
market for corn farmers and [provide]{.mark} some **[certainty]{.mark}**
as farmers begin the hard work of planting and harvesting their
crop.]{.underline} [Ratifying [USMCA]{.mark} will also [instill
confidence]{.mark} in other [nations]{.mark} with [whom we want to
enter]{.mark} into [future trade agreements. Opening **new
markets**]{.mark} **will [ensure U.S. ag]{.mark}riculture [remains
competitive]{.mark}** for generations to come.]{.underline} The existing
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has been an unequivocal
success for American agriculture. Over the past 20 years, U.S.
agricultural exports to Canada have tripled and quintupled to Mexico.
Exports of feed grains in all forms, which includes corn, sorghum, and
barley, increased an astounding 329 percent since NAFTA went into effect
in 1994. President Trump followed through on his campaign promise to
renegotiate the existing North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),
announcing the renamed USMCA with leaders from Mexico and Canada this
past November. Now, farmers are taking an active role to get it across
the finish line. Cementing these markets and reaffirming our trading
relationships with our North American partners is why leaders of
commodity organizations representing corn, soybeans, wheat and sorghum
stood together before more than 9,000 attendees at last month's
Commodity Classic and pledged to work together to see USMCA ratified
this year. For corn farmers, [USMCA preserves and builds upon our
successful trading relationship with Mexico and Canada. USMCA maintains
zero tariffs on U.S. corn and corn products while also setting a high
standard for future trade agreements in areas critical to U.S.
agriculture such as biotechnology and the creation of a rapid-response
mechanism to address trade challenges.]{.underline} But it's not just
farmers who benefit from North American trade. [In 2014, 17.3 million
American jobs were related to agriculture, more than 9 percent of total
U.S. employment. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that NAFTA
supports 14 million U.S. jobs.]{.underline} We can't afford to lose this
market. [The president has threatened to withdraw from NAFTA if Congress
does not approve USMCA. We take this threat seriously and recognize that
**[without USMCA, American ag]{.mark}riculture and rural communities
[would be devastated.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [A Purdue University and
Farm Foundation study found that [this]{.mark} action [would amount to a
**\$9.4 billion loss in ag**]{.mark}**ricultural [exports

[ratification of]{.mark} the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement
([USMCA]{.mark})]{.underline}. The letter was sent on June 11 by more
than 960 groups representing the U.S. food and agriculture value chain
at the national, state and local.

An excerpt of the letter says:

"Over the last 25 years, [[U.S. food and
agricultural]{.underline}]{.mark} exports to Canada and Mexico have more
than quadrupled under NAFTA -- growing from \$9 billion in 1993 to
nearly \$40 billion in 2018. [NAFTA has significantly helped create a
reliable, high-quality supply of food products for U.S. consumers, while
[suppor]{.mark}ting more [than 900,000 American jobs in food and

The letter was signed by a number of national groups representing
farmers and ranchers, including:

American Farm Bureau Federation

American Soybean Association

National Cattlemen's Beef Association

National Council of Farmer Cooperatives

National Cotton Council

National Corn Growers Association

National Milk Producers Federation

National Pork Producers Council

National Sorghum Producers

Also signing the letter were food processing companies, along with state
and local agriculture associations.

Discussions in Congress

A hearing was held by the House Agriculture Livestock and Foreign
Agriculture Subcommittee the same day the letter was sent. The
subcommittee was reviewing the state of U.S. agricultural products in
international markets and following the hearing Subcommittee Ranking
Member David Rouzer (R-NC) and Committee Ranking Member K. Michael
Conaway (R-TX) both expressed the importance of getting USMCA passed.

"[USMCA is a no-brainer for American agriculture. If the International
Trade Commission's (ITC) estimated \$2.2 billion increase in ag exports
doesn't convince my colleagues]{.underline}, then all they need to do is
talk to a local farmer or rancher. American producers have made it
clear: the best thing we can do for our lagging agriculture economy is
get this deal done. I urge my colleagues on the committee to join me in
calling for Speaker Pelosi to bring USMCA to a vote in the House as soon
as possible," says Rep. Rouzer.

"Rather than spew platitudes about the importance of free trade to
American agriculture, it's time for the House Democratic Leadership to
get serious about the clear win that sits before them -- the USMCA
agreement. Today's hearing further underscored that ratifying USMCA is
critically important to America's farmers, ranchers, and dairymen. With
the ITC report in hand, Speaker Pelosi should bring USMCA up for a vote
as quickly as possible," says Rep. Conaway.

Dairy Voicing Concerns

[[The dairy industry]{.mark} had already [pushed for swift passage of
USMCA]{.mark}]{.underline} just a day prior, on June 10, when three
national dairy groups, including the International Dairy Foods
Association (IDFA), sent a similar letter to members of the House of
Representatives. IDFA released a statement regarding the latest letter
expressing the importance of USMCA because of fixes to current trade
policies with Canada and Mexico.

"[[USMCA meets the U.S. dairy industry's]{.mark} top [priorities]{.mark}
to ensure a more level playing field, including preserving duty-free
market access to Mexico, eliminating the unfair Canadian Class 7 pricing
program and increasing market access to the Canadian
market]{.underline}," says Michael Dykes, DVM, president and CEO of
IDFA. "The U.S[. [dairy industry]{.mark}, which [supports]{.mark} more
than [3 million jobs in the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and pumps
\$620 billion into the]{.mark} U.S. [economy]{.mark}, is making a strong
appeal to Congress to vote to ratify this important trade
deal]{.underline}. [[USMCA will ensure that]{.mark} [our]{.mark} [dairy
industry grows]{.mark} valuable market share and continues to be viewed
by our North American customers as a reliable supplie]{.underline}r."

[[For]{.mark} the [farmers]{.mark} that I represent in central and
west-central Illinois, [access to markets in Canada and Mexico **is
vital** to their success.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[When harvest comes and farmers take their products to market, they rely
upon the open-market free-trade system with our neighbors to the north
and south to remain competitive in the global economy.]{.underline}

Over the last 25 years, [[free trade]{.mark} with Mexico and Canada has
supported over 900,000 jobs in the food and agricultural sector and
[quadrupled exports]{.mark} from \$9 billion to almost \$40 billion. In
the heartland of America, we have some of the richest farmland in the
world, and thanks to free trade, our farmers have been able to feed and
fuel not only our country, but the world.]{.underline}

As we look ahead toward the next 25 years, updating our trade policies
will enable our farmers and ranchers to continue leading the way in the
agriculture economy. That is why President Trump and U.S. Trade
Representative Robert Lighthizer worked tirelessly to negotiate the
United States-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement, which builds upon the
success our agricultural sector has seen through free trade with our
neighbors.

Not only does [[USMCA]{.mark} maintain the duty-free access for American
farmers to Mexico and Canada, it [will deliver]{.mark} an
[additional]{.mark} \$2.2 billion in [economic
activity]{.mark}.]{.underline} Passage of USMCA will also open the
Canadian market for American dairy, wheat, chicken, egg, and turkey
products. It will also increase real GDP by \$68.2 billion and create
176,000 U.S. jobs, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission,
helping manufacturers and small business, as well.

[[Getting USMCA done will strengthen our]{.mark} food and
[ag]{.mark}]{.underline}ricultural [[economy and]{.mark} give certainty
to farmers, so they can make new investments to [grow]{.mark} their
[operations]{.mark}.]{.underline}

I often remind my friends in Chicago and in Washington, that in
Illinois, agriculture is our number one industry in terms of economic
impact. It's no secret that the agriculture community has endured a
tough spring with low commodity prices, flooding, and ongoing trade
disputes, but Congress can take a significant step by delivering
certainty through passage of USMCA.

However, as things stand, USMCA is being held hostage by career
politicians in Washington who are hell-bent on preventing President
Trump from getting a win. A delay in approval of this agreement will hit
the wallets of family farms in Illinois and across the country[. The
agriculture community is losing out because political gamesmanship is
being placed in front of their interests.]{.underline}

[[There's too much at stake]{.mark} for our farmers [to let this]{.mark}
opportunity [pass by. USMCA will expand economic opportunity]{.mark} in
the heartland.]{.underline} It will provide the framework for the next
25 years of free trade in North America. [And [it will ensure
ag]{.mark}]{.underline}riculture [[remains competitive]{.mark} in our
ever-evolving global economy.]{.underline}

[[USMCA is a win]{.mark} for America,]{.underline} a win for the
Midwest, a win for Illinois, and a win for the family farmer. Congress
must come together and get this done. [[Delaying]{.mark} it further
[will only **hurt**]{.mark} American [agriculture]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[said]{.mark}]{.underline} the previous North American Free Trade
Agreement, an agreement for tariff-free trade across the continent, was
very lucrative for Texas. NAFTA is still in effect, but [the threat of
tariffs and [the possibility of a new deal has made the market
unstable.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In 2018, Mexico was by far Texas' biggest trading partner, as 37 percent
of the state's exports---about \$109.7 billion---went to Mexico. [The

#### Passing USMCA is key to ensuring the intellectual property rights that allow for pharma innovation

[[Congress will]{.mark} soon [consider]{.mark} the new North American
trade deal, dubbed [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates-[M]{.mark}exico-[C]{.mark}anada
[A]{.mark}greement.]{.underline} When U.S. government officials
negotiated the deal, they asked their Mexican and Canadian counterparts
to lift their nations' intellectual property standards for certain
advanced drugs.

But now, some U.S. lawmakers are taking issue with this provision,
claiming it will adversely impact U.S. drug prices. They're wrong.
[[USMCA's intellectual property rules will catalyze]{.mark} further
[investment in medical research]{.mark} without affecting
prices]{.underline}. If Congress wants to help patients here and abroad,
they'll pass the trade deal assigned by the three countries last fall.

The [[United States leads]{.mark} the world [in medical
innovation]{.mark}. American labs are responsible for more than half of
all drugs currently being developed worldwide.]{.underline} This
includes more than 1,000 cancer treatments, 85 drugs to fight
Alzheimer's disease, and another 550 that combat rare diseases.

There's a reason America leads in innovation. [Our nation's [robust
i]{.mark}]{.underline}ntellectual [[p]{.underline}]{.mark}roperty
[[protections]{.mark} [encourage researchers to develop their products
here]{.mark}. Thanks to our patent protections, firms pour billions of
dollars into research and development projects in America each year ---
\$90 billion in 2016 alone.]{.underline}

In particular, [[U.S. patent law]{.mark} has [encouraged the development
of biologics]{.mark} --- complex drugs made using living organisms.
[Biologics have proven successful in treating]{.mark} a number of
conditions, including multiple sclerosis and
[cancer]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since 2004, the FDA has approved five
biologics to treat colon cancer. Treatment options are one key to
advancing patient health. [Good public policies drives private industry
investment and competition.]{.underline}

The United States offers 12 years of "regulatory data protection" for
biologics. For the duration of that window, rival companies can't
manufacturer copycat versions of these drugs, called biosimilars. That
gives innovators a chance to recoup their sky-high investment costs.

[Many other countries recognize the value of strong intellectual
property protections]{.underline}. The entire European Union, for
example, provides 10 years of regulatory data protection for biologics.
Existing Canadian law only provides eight years. Mexico doesn't offer
anything. [[USMCA would require both countries to offer at least 10
years of protection]{.mark}, bringing them closer to the U.S.
standard.]{.underline}

That's great news for patients. [[With]{.mark} scientific [discoveries
protected]{.mark} at home and abroad, [more investors would]{.mark} be
spurred to [pour money into the next generation of
biologics]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unfortunately, a handful of lawmakers
want to eliminate USMCA's section on biologics. This doesn't make sense.
There's no evidence to suggest that reducing intellectual property
protections would cut costs. In fact, a report from the Geneva Network
found that [USMCA would have zero effect on drug prices and total drug
spending within overall health care systems]{.underline}.

The Geneva Network report examined the effects of increasing regulatory
data protection in Canada and Japan. More than a decade ago, both
nations extended an eight-year window to all medicines, not just
biologics. The report concludes that increasing the protection had no
impact on drug spending in Japan or Canada. In fact, drug spending
declined as a percentage of both countries' health spending after they
increased regulatory data protection.

cliv

The revised NAFTA agreement --- now the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement
([USMCA) --- has been making progress, and Canada is now proceeding with
ratification of the deal]{.underline}. However, [a challenge standing in
the way of full ratification is objections to some of the life-sciences,
copyright, and other intellectual property (IP) provisions]{.underline}
established in USMCA's Chapter 20.

One provision under consideration addresses data protection for
biologics. A "biologic" is a large molecule drug made from complex
biological processes --- much more complex than the simple chemical
compounds used for more common drugs we take as pills. Their complexity
means these drugs tend to be newer and more advanced, but also more
difficult and expensive to develop. Extended protection of the clinical
trial data demonstrating the safety and efficacy of biologic drugs,
which the [[USMCA obliges]{.mark} member [nations]{.mark} [to provide at
a 10-year minimum term]{.mark}, helps facilitate biologic drugs'
development, [offering]{.mark} additional [protection for a biologic
beyond patents]{.mark} on the molecular compound or biofabrication
process alone. [It works by delaying the ability of a knock-off]{.mark}
drug [to use the]{.mark} innovator's [clinical trial and]{.mark} related
[data]{.mark} to qualify for sale.]{.underline}

Ten years may seem like a long time, but research indicates that drugs
commonly take more than 12 years to recoup the investment in research
that makes them possible. The United States already exceeds the ten-year
minimum requirement by offering data protection for 12 years. However,
Canada and Mexico fall below this standard; Canada offers data
protection for only eight years, and Mexico offers no biologic-specific
data protection. [Establishing [this]{.mark} 10-year requirement [would
level the]{.mark} playing [field for innovation]{.mark} in all
countries, [help attract]{.mark} additional [life-sciences
research]{.mark} and development into Canada and Mexico, [and spur
more]{.mark} life-sciences [investment]{.mark} in the United
States.]{.underline}

While the United States already observes stronger data protection than
would be required under Chapter 20, the provision has drawn some
criticism. Some unions, medical, and faith-based groups, as well as
civil society organizations, recently sent a letter to Congress opposing
additional market exclusivity for biologics. They argue that the USMCA
would "entrench and expand prescription drug monopoly protections,
thwart competition and thus undermine efforts to expand access to
affordable medicines."

[This argument is deeply misguided, and it threatens future
life-sciences innovation]{.underline}. The market for biosimilars
(essentially a generic of a biotech drug) is not the same as for generic
versions of simpler, old-style drugs. It costs far more to develop and
seek approval for a biosimilar, and cost reductions will be around 30
percent (estimates range from 8 to 43 percent) --- not the steep
discounts we see with generic pharmaceutical drugs. And while
competition between biologics and "biosimilars" is indeed useful, what
matters most is competition between proprietary biologics. [[Such
competition is]{.mark} far more [beneficial]{.mark} than competition
with knock-off drugs [because it is driven by innovation, creating
new]{.mark}-to-the-world [medicines and bringing more effective]{.mark}
and patient-friendly [delivery mechanisms]{.mark} to the fore.
Reasonable [data protection]{.mark} rules [give companies]{.mark}
developing new biotech drugs [the]{.mark} right [incentives to keep
making these]{.mark} highly risky, yet beneficial, [investments]{.mark}.
[Thanks to IP protections]{.mark} and a vibrant American life-sciences
innovation ecosystem, [competition]{.mark} among proprietary biologics
[is robust]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[America's robust [IP protections]{.mark} for biologic drugs [are one
key reason why]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [leads the
world in life-sciences innovation]{.mark}. **IP [protections
ensure]{.mark} continued [innovation that leads to important medical
advances and cures]{.mark}**. These also create good jobs and support
U.S. competitiveness and exports. And as part of the USMCA, they
facilitate commerce between two of our most important trading
partners.]{.underline}

The United States must stand up for innovation in the debate over the
USMCA. It must make the case that Chapter 20 is beneficial not just for
the United States, but for Canada and Mexico as well. [[Without U.S.
leadership]{.mark}, American, and by extension, [global life-sciences
innovation could diminish, taking medical advances, economic growth, and
good jobs with it]{.mark}]{.underline}. The U.S. must stand up for
life-sciences innovation throughout North America and forge ahead with
USMCA ratification now.

Many are suspicious of, or indeed jealous of, the good fortune of
others. Even when profit is gained in the market without fraud and with
the consent of all buying and selling goods and services, there is a
sense on the part of some that something is wrong if considerable profit
is secured. There is even a sense that good fortune in the market,
especially if it is very good fortune, is unfair. One might think of
such rhetorically disparaging terms as \"wind-fall profits\". There is
also a suspicion of the pursuit of profit because it is often embraced
not just because of the material benefits it sought, but because of the
hierarchical satisfaction of being more affluent than others. The
pursuit of profit in the pharmaceutical and medical-device industries is
tor many in particular morally dubious because it is acquired from those
who have the bad fortune to be diseased or disabled. Although the
suspicion of profit is not well-founded, this suspicion is a major moral
and public-policy challenge. [[Profit in]{.mark} the market for the
[pharma]{.mark}ceutical]{.underline} and medical-device [industries
[is]{.mark} to be [celebrated]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is the case, in
that if one is of the view (1) that [the presence of additional
resources for **[r]{.mark}**esearch [and **d**]{.mark}evelopment
**[spurs innovation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in the development of
pharmaceuticals]{.underline} and med-ical devices (i.e., if one is of
the view that the allure of [[profit is]{.mark} one of [the most
effective way]{.mark}s not only to acquire resources but productively
[to direct human energies]{.mark}]{.underline} in their use), (2) that
given the limits of altruism and of the willingness of persons to be
taxed, the possibility of profits is necessary to secure such resources,
(3) that the allure of [profits]{.underline} also tends to [enhance the
creative use of available resources in the pursuit of
phar-maceutical]{.underline} and medical-device
[innovation]{.underline}, and (4) if one judges it to be the case that
such **[[innovation is]{.underline}]{.mark}** both [**[necessary to
maintain the human species]{.underline}** [in a]{.underline}]{.mark}[n
ever-[changing and]{.mark} always [dangerous environment in which **new

[survival]{.mark}**]{.underline} (i.e., that such [[innovation is

[mortality]{.mark} risks]{.underline}), [as well as]{.underline} (5) in
order generally to [decrease morbidity]{.underline} and [mortality risks
in the]{.underline} future, it then follows (6) that [one should be
concerned regarding any policies that decrease the amount of resources

should indeed be of the view that the possibilities for profit, all

#### The 10-year provision of the USMCA protects pharma innovation which key to new medicines

Promoting public health has always been a bipartisan priority in
Washington, D.C. Under the previous administration, lawmakers passed the
21st Century Cures Act and launched the cancer moonshot, two initiatives
that aimed to transform health outcomes through greater investment in
the next generation of medical treatments.

In his State of the Union address last month, President Trump announced
an ambitious plan to end HIV/AIDS by 2030 and increase funding for
often-neglected childhood cancers.

For each of these initiatives to be successful, [lawmakers must
recognize that [investing in the cures]{.mark} of tomorrow [requires
continued bipartisan cooperation]{.mark}. This rings [true for passing
the]{.mark} U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement ([USMCA]{.mark}), as
well.]{.underline}

The next generation of medical innovation depends on significant private
sector investments[. The]{.underline} intellectual property [[(IP)
provisions]{.mark} of USMCA help to [lay the foundation for]{.mark}
continued [investment into]{.mark} the research and development
([R&D]{.mark}) [of innovative cures]{.mark} across North
America]{.underline}. In particular, [[the 10-year term]{.mark} of
regulatory data protection for biologics will help [ensure that]{.mark}
North [America continues]{.mark} to lead the world [in developing
life-saving technologies]{.mark}]{.underline}.

For most of the relatively short history of modern medicine---aspirin
was the pioneer in 1899---drugs prescribed to patients were
small-molecule chemical products. For generations, innovative
pharmaceutical companies have made high-risk, high-capital R&D
investments to produce treatments on the basis of patent rights that
provide a limited period of exclusivity to recoup front-end investment.
While the U.S., Mexico, and Canada all offer a 20-year term of patent
protection, innovators must file for patent protection long before a
medicine enters the market. So, in practice, the effective period of
market exclusivity is much shorter.

Today, 40% of the U.S. prescription drug market is comprised not of
small molecule pharmaceuticals but of biologics. These are complex (or
"large molecule") medicines derived from living cells. [[Biologic
medicines have enabled]{.mark} the emerging bio-pharmaceutical
[community to treat]{.mark} conditions---ranging from [infectious
diseases to rare genetic disorders to cancers]{.mark}---for which there
had been no viable treatment options. Comprising nearly 70% of today's
innovation pipeline, [biologics are the medicine of the
future.]{.mark}]{.underline}

To make the most of the vast potential that biologics hold, [a strong
framework of legal rights is needed to make possible the enormous
investment these medical innovations represent.]{.underline} Biologics
are derived from living organisms, an area of considerable ambiguity in
domestic and global patent law. Given the degree of legal uncertainty
surrounding biologics patents, bio-pharmaceutical companies rely on
governments to instead provide a period of exclusivity for the
proprietary information they must submit to prove the safety and
efficacy of a new biologic medicine.

The exclusive right to the data that companies produce at their own
expense through R&D and clinical trials is known as regulatory data
protection or RDP. [The [USMCA will guarantee a 10-year minimum
term]{.mark} of RDP for biologics innovators throughout North America,
which stands as a significant advancement of Canada's and Mexico's
current laws. [This will]{.mark} help [ensure that innovators]{.mark}
across North America can [continue to invest]{.mark} in life-saving
biologics.]{.underline}

Critics claim that RDP will increase the cost of medicines, but research
from the Geneva Network illustrates that when Canada and Japan extended
the term of RDP in the past, it had no significant impact on
pharmaceutical expenditure. In fact, when Canada introduced an
eight-year term of RDP in 2006, pharmaceutical expenditure as a
percentage of total health spending actually decreased in the years that
followed.

Others have argued that RDP will delay the entry of less expensive
follow-on medicines. Unlike small-molecule pharmaceuticals, where the
manufacture of a "generic" version is a relatively straightforward---if
complex---process, the living organism that comprises a biologic
medicine cannot be exactly replicated. Instead, follow-on producers
generate a highly comparable product, known as a biosimilar. Though
these drugs are not identical to the innovator's, biosimilar
manufacturers rely on the original innovator's test data to warrant the
safety, purity, and efficacy of their own treatment, and meanwhile, they
bear none of the cost of producing that data.

Given the complexity of and time required to manufacture biosimilars,
studies have shown that a 10-year term of RDP for the innovative
biologic does not delay the introduction of the biosimilar in the
marketplace. Thus, concerns that RDP will undermine the availability of
cheaper, follow-on products are unfounded.

The dual objectives of continued medical innovation and enhanced public
health across North America require effective legal protections that
guarantee the rights of innovators and provide a pathway for cheaper
generics and biosimilars to follow. The 10-year term of RDP included in
the USMCA will ensure that innovative companies across the region can
invest in the next generation of medical technology, while preserving
the pathway for lower cost follow-ons.

[Improving public health by [enabling medical innovation should be a
bipartisan priority]{.mark}, and [congressional approval of the USMCA
will ensure]{.mark} that North American [innovators can]{.mark} continue
to [invest in the cures of tomorrow]{.mark}.]{.underline}

As we reported, Canada has joined a new trilateral trade deal called the
United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). The [[USMCA
contains]{.mark} important [new protections for biologic and other
pharma]{.mark}]{.underline}ceutical [[innovation]{.mark}. Chief among
them, Canada will introduce an extended ten-year period of data
protection for biologics and patent-term restoration (PTR) for delays in
the patent office.]{.underline}

The USMCA, which replaces the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA), will come into force after it has been signed and ratified by
the member states. It is anticipated that the USMCA will be signed
before the end of 2018, but dates for its ratification and the NAFTA\'s
expiry have yet to be determined.

Extended data protection for biologics

[Ten years of protection\... Article 20.F.14 of the [USMCA requires
parties to provide new biologics with a minimum of ten years\' data
protection]{.mark} from the date of first marketing
authorisation]{.underline}. This period is greater than the eight years
currently provided by Canada for biologics (together with all other
pharmaceuticals), but less than the twelve years already provided for
biologics by the U.S. under the Biologics Price Competition and
Innovation Act.

\...for new biologics. The [USMCA obligations regarding extended data
protection apply to new pharmaceutical products that are or contain
biologics]{.underline}. The scope of this obligation is defined by the
following:

New pharmaceutical products are defined to be those that do not contain
a chemical entity that has been previously approved in that party.

The USMCA does not include a definition of \"biologic\" per se, but
provides that [[each Party shall apply this Article
to]{.underline}]{.mark}, at a minimum, a [[product]{.mark} that is
produced using biotechnology processes and that is, or, alternatively,
contains, a virus, therapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, vaccine, blood,
blood component or derivative, allergenic product, protein, or analogous
product, [for use in human beings for the prevention, treatment, or cure
of a disease or condition]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Parties are not required to apply this provision to biosimilars.

#### Stronger IP protections for biologics are critical.

[In the United States, [the law currently includes a 12-year data
protection term for biologics]{.mark}]{.underline}. Pharmaceutical
companies previously lobbied for a data protection term of 14 to 16
years, while the Obama administration sought a 7-year protection term in
an attempt to reduce drug prices. The 12- year term was ultimately
agreed upon to obtain congressional approval for the Affordable Care
Act. Critics of longer data protection terms, such as the US-based
Association for Accessible Medicine, have voiced concerns that longer
protection terms create "a windfall for brand-name drug manufacturers
and raise prescription drug prices for patients in the United States."
On the other hand, [proponents of longer data protection terms argue
that [biologics are among the **most promising medications** but also
the **most costly to produce**]{.mark}]{.underline}; [thus the
[increased protection term **incentivizes

### a2: no disease extinction

#### Pharma key to combat bioterror

Nuclear Threat Initiative in Washington, D.C. She was assistant

York City commissioner of health. , Winter **2002**, \"Preparing for and

Federal health leadership will be important in this effort to define
needs and provide model guidelines and standards; federal resources may
also be essential to support planning efforts and to create the
incentives necessary to bring the voluntary and private health care
sector fully on board. However, the final planning process must be
undertaken on the local or regional level, engaging all the essential
community partners and capabilities. It is critical to remember that the
front line of response, even in a national crisis, is always local.
Thus, across all these domains of activity, we must make sure that we
have adequate capacity locally and regionally, which can then be
supplemented as needed.

Another important example of this involves access to essential drugs and
vaccines[. [A large-scale release of a bio]{.mark}logical [weapon may
require rapid access to quantities of antibiotics]{.mark}, vaccines, or
antidotes [that would not be routinely available]{.mark} in the
locations affected]{.underline}. Given that such an attack is a low
probability and unpredictable event in any given place, it would hardly
be sensible or cost effective to stockpile supplies at the local level.

The first step in blocking the proliferation and use of biological
weapons is to significantly bolster our intelligence.

[[As we ramp up our]{.mark} public health and [medical capacity to
respond to bioterror]{.mark}ism**, [we should continue to strengthen our
national pharma]{.mark}ceutical [stockpile so that vital drugs]{.mark}
and equipment [can be rapidly mobilized]{.mark} as
needed**]{.underline}. The federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) has the responsibility to maintain and oversee use of
this stockpile, which currently represents a cache of supplies located
in strategic locations across the country that can be delivered within
12 hours to any place in the nation. Current concerns make it clear that
the nature and quantities of materials maintained in the stockpile must
be enhanced, and the stockpile contents should be periodically reviewed
and adjusted in response to intelligence about credible threats. [New
investments in the stockpile should also include contractual agreements
with pharmaceutical manufacturer's to ensure extra production capability
for drugs and vaccines in a crisis as well as heightened security at the
various storage and dispersal sites.]{.underline}

Beyond simply having the drugs and vaccines available, we must develop
plans for how those critical supplies will be distributed to those who
need them. CDC needs to provide [strong leadership and support for state
and local health departments to undertake contingency planning for
distribution. [We must also think about the broader mobilization of
essential drugs]{.mark}, vaccines, or other materials [in the event that
they are needed outside the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}.
Although this may raise complex diplomatic issues, especially when the
necessary pharmaceutical is in short supply, addressing potential global
need is essential for political and disease-control reasons.

To make sure that the United States can remain strategically poised,
further investments must be made in biomedical research to develop new
drugs, vaccines, rapid diagnostic tests, and other medical weapons to
add to the arsenal against bioterrorism. We must learn more about the
fundamental questions of how these organisms cause disease and how the
human immune system responds so that we can develop better treatments
and disease-containment strategies. It is also essential that we improve
technologies to rapidly detect biological agents from environmental
samples and develop new strategies and technologies to protect the
health of the public.

Scientists will need the full support and encouragement of the public
and the government confront this threat. Success will entail research
endeavors and collaboration involving numerous government agencies,
universities, and private companies. Looking to the future, an
effective, well-funded research agenda may give us the tools to render
the threat of biological weapons obsolete.

#### Extinction\-\--defense is wrong

Health Security, Vol 15(4),
<http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/hs.2017.0028>

Historically, [[disease events]{.mark} [have been responsible for the
**greatest death tolls**]{.mark} on humanity. The 1918 flu was
responsible for more than 50 million deaths]{.underline},1 while
[smallpox killed perhaps 10 times that many in the 20th century
alone.]{.underline}2 [The Black Death was responsible for killing over
25% of the European population]{.underline},3 while [other
pandemics]{.underline}, such as the plague of Justinian, [are thought to
have killed 25 million]{.underline} in the 6th century---constituting
over 10% of the world's population at the time.4 It is an open question
whether [a [future pandemic could]{.mark} [result in]{.mark} outright
[human extinction]{.mark} or the irreversible collapse of
civilization]{.underline}.

[[A skeptic would have]{.underline}]{.mark} many good [[reasons to
think]{.mark} that [existential risk]{.mark} from disease [is unlikely.
Such a disease would need to spread **worldwide**]{.mark} to remote
populations, overcome]{.underline} rare [genetic resistances, [and evade
detection]{.mark}]{.underline}, cures, and countermeasures. Even
evolution itself may work in humanity's favor: [[Virulence and
transmission is]{.mark} often [a trade-off]{.mark}]{.underline}, and so
evolutionary pressures could push against maximally lethal wild-type
pathogens.5,6

While [[these arguments]{.underline}]{.mark} point to a very small risk
of human extinction, **[they [do not rule the possibility
out]{.mark}]{.underline}** entirely. Although rare, [[there are recorded
instances of species going extinct due to
disease]{.underline}]{.mark}---primarily in amphibians, but also in 1
mammalian species of rat on Christmas Island.7,8 There [are also
[historical examples of large human populations being]{.mark} almost
entirely [wiped out]{.mark} by disease, [especially when multiple
diseases were simultaneously introduced]{.mark} into a
population]{.underline} without immunity. The most striking examples of
total population collapse include native American tribes exposed to
European diseases, such as the Massachusett (86% loss of population),
Quiripi-Unquachog (95% loss of population), and theWestern Abenaki
(which suffered a staggering 98% loss of population).

In the modern context, no single disease currently exists that combines
the worst-case levels of transmissibility, lethality, resistance to
countermeasures, and global reach. But [many diseases are proof of
principle that each worst-case attribute can be realized
independently.]{.underline} For example, [[some diseases exhibit]{.mark}
nearly a [100%]{.mark} case [fatality]{.mark} ratio in the absence of
treatment]{.underline}, such as rabies or septicemic plague[. [Other
diseases have a track record of spreading to]{.mark} **virtually
[every]{.mark} human [community worldwide]{.mark}**,]{.underline} such
as the 1918 flu,10 and [seroprevalence studies indicate that other
pathogens,]{.underline} such as chickenpox and HSV-1[, can successfully
reach over **95% of a population**]{.underline}.11,12 [Under optimal
virulence theory, natural evolution would be an unlikely source for
pathogens with the highest possible levels of
transmissibility]{.underline}, virulence, and global reach. [But
[advances in biotech]{.mark}nology [might allow the creation of diseases
that combine]{.mark} such [traits]{.mark}.]{.underline} Recent
controversy has already emerged over a number of scientific experiments
that resulted in viruses with enhanced transmissibility, lethality,
and/or the ability to overcome therapeutics.13-17 Other experiments
demonstrated that mousepox could be modified to have a 100% case
fatality rate and render a vaccine ineffective.18 In addition to
transmissibility and lethality, [studies have shown that other disease
traits, such as incubation time, environmental survival, and available
vectors, could be modifie]{.underline}d as well.19-2

2\. [Pandemic [diseases **threaten humanity**]{.mark}]{.underline}

One possibility is the disgruntled individual who might create or steal
a virus and travel around the world releasing it

[Natural and engineered pandemic disease is one of the most-studied
global risks. It is an area given new urgency by the controversy over
\"gain of function\" experiments. These involve taking a known pathogen
and adding extra, risky functionality]{.underline}. For example, [in
2011, virologists]{.underline} Ron Fouchier and Yoshihiro Kawaoka
[created a strain of the bird flu virus that could be transmitted
between ferrets]{.underline}. This was done in order to better
understand the conditions in which the virus might develop
transmitability in the wild. Such experiments can head off certain risks
but create an arguably greater one, in that [[the modified organism
might escape]{.mark} the lab [and cause a **global
pandemic**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[The risk]{.mark} here [is]{.mark} particularly [great]{.mark} because
[it is **self-replicating**]{.mark}. Whereas a nuclear explosion is
localised, [in our **highly connected** world a synthetic, incurable
virus could **spread around the planet in days**]{.mark}. In the past,
[natural pandemics]{.mark} such as the black death [have killed
millions]{.mark} and effected wholesale social changes. In the 21st
century[, advanced biotech]{.mark}nology [could]{.mark} create something
that **[makes the black death look like a]{.mark} nasty

We fear [[it is only a matter of time]{.mark} before]{.underline} [we
face a **deadlier and more contagious pathogen**, yet the threat of a
deadly pandemic remains dangerously overlooked]{.underline}.
[[Pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[occur with **great**]{.mark}**er
[frequency]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [due to]{.underline} factors such as
**[climate change]{.underline}**, **[urbanization]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[international travel]{.underline}**. Other factors,
such as [[a weak W]{.underline}]{.mark}orld
[[H]{.underline}]{.mark}ealth [[O]{.underline}]{.mark}rganization [and
potentially massive cuts to funding for U.S.]{.underline} scientific
[research]{.underline} and foreign aid, including funding for the United
Nations, [stand to [deepen our vulnerability]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[We
also]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[face]{.mark} the specter of [novel and
mutated pathogens that could spread and kill faster than]{.mark}
diseases we have seen [before]{.mark}]{.underline}**. With the advent of
genome-editing technologies, bioterrorists could artificially engineer
new plagues, a threat that Ashton Carter, the former U.S. secretary of
defense, thinks could **[[rival nuclear weapons in
deadliness]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The two of us have advised the
president of Guinea on stopping Ebola. In addition, we have worked on
ways to contain the spread of Zika and have informally advised U.S. and
international organizations on the matter. [Our experiences tell us that
the world is unprepared for these threats]{.underline}. We urgently need
to change this trajectory. We can start by learning four lessons from
the gaps exposed by the Ebola and Zika pandemics. Faster Vaccine
Development The most effective way to stop pandemics is with vaccines.
However, with Ebola there was no vaccine, and only now, years later, has
one proven effective. This has been the case with Zika, too. Though
there has been rapid progress in developing and getting a vaccine to
market, it is not fast enough, and Zika has already spread worldwide.
Many other diseases do not have vaccines, and developing them takes too
long when a pandemic is already under way. We need faster pipelines,
such as the one that the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations
is trying to create, to preemptively develop vaccines for diseases
predicted to cause outbreaks in the near future. Point-of-Care
Diagnostics Even with such efforts, vaccines will not be ready for many
diseases and would not even be an option for novel or artificially
engineered pathogens. With no vaccine for Ebola, our next best strategy
was to identify who was infected as quickly as possible and isolate them
before they infected others. Because Ebola's symptoms were identical to
common illnesses like malaria, diagnosis required laboratory testing
that could not be easily scaled. As a result, many patients were only
tested after several days of being contagious and infecting others. Some
were never tested at all, and about 40% of patients in Ebola treatment
centers did not actually have Ebola. Many dangerous pathogens similarly
require laboratory testing that is difficult to scale. Florida, for
example, has not been able to expand testing for Zika, so pregnant women
wait weeks to know if their babies might be affected. What's needed are
point-of-care diagnostics that, like pregnancy tests, can be used by
frontline responders or patients themselves to detect infection right
away, where they live. These tests already exist for many diseases, and
the technology behind them is well-established. However, the process for
their validation is slow and messy. Point-of-care diagnostics for Ebola,
for example, were available but never used because of such bottlenecks.
Greater Global Coordination **[We need stronger global
coordination]{.underline}**. The [[responsibility]{.mark} for
controlling pandemics [is **fragmented,** ]{.mark}**spread across too
many players [with no unifying authority]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
Guinea we forged a response out of an amalgam of over 30 organizations,
each of which had its own priorities. [In Ebola's aftermath, there have
been calls for a mechanism for responding to pandemics similar to the
advance planning and training that NATO has in place for its numerous
members to respond to military threats in a quick, coordinated
fashion]{.underline}. This is the right thinking, but we are far from
seeing it happen. The errors that allowed Ebola to become a crisis
replayed with Zika, and the [[WHO]{.mark}, which should anchor global
action, continues to [suffer from a lack of
credibility]{.mark}]{.underline}. Stronger Local Health Systems
[[International actors]{.mark} are essential but **[cannot]{.mark}
parachute into countries and [navigate local dynamics quickly
enough]{.mark} to contain outbreaks**]{.underline}. In Guinea it took
months to establish the ground game needed to stop the pandemic, with
Ebola continuing to spread in the meantime. We need to help developing
countries establish health systems that can provide routine care and,
when needed, coordinate with international responders to contain new
outbreaks. Local health systems could be established for about half of
the \$3.6 billion ultimately spent on creating an Ebola response from
scratch. [Access to **routine care** is also **essential**]{.underline}
for knowing when an outbreak is taking root and establishing trust. For
months, Ebola spread before anyone knew it was happening, and then
lingered because communities who had never had basic health care doubted
the intentions of foreigners flooding into their villages. The turning
point in the pandemic came when they began to trust what they were
hearing about Ebola and understood what they needed to do to halt its
spread: identify those exposed and safely bury the dead. [With Ebola and
Zika, we lacked]{.underline} these four things --- vaccines,
diagnostics, [global coordination, and local health systems --- which
are still urgently needed]{.underline}. However, prevailing political
headwinds in [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}, which
[has [played a **key role in combatting pandemics**]{.mark} **around the
world**]{.underline}, threaten to make things worse. The Trump
administration is seeking drastic budget cuts in funding for foreign aid
and scientific research. The U.S. State Department and U.S. Agency for
International Development may lose over one-third of their budgets,
including half of the funding the U.S. usually provides to the UN. The
National Institutes of Health, which has been on the vanguard of
vaccines and diagnostics research, may also face cuts. The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, which has been at the forefront of
responding to outbreaks, remains without a director, and, if the
Affordable Care Act is repealed, would lose \$891 million, 12% of its
overall budget, provided to it for immunization programs, monitoring and
responding to outbreaks, and other public health initiatives. [Investing
in our ability to prevent and contain pandemics through **revitalized
national**]{.underline} and international **[institutions]{.underline}**
[should be our]{.underline} shared [goal]{.underline}. However, if U.S.
agencies become less able to respond to pandemics, leading institutions
from other nations, such as Institut Pasteur and the National Institute
of Health and Medical Research in France, the Wellcome Trust and London
School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in the UK, and nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs have done instrumental research and response work in
previous pandemics), would need to step in to fill the void. There is no
border wall against disease. **[[Pandemics are an existential threat on
par with climate change and nuclear conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**. We
are at a critical crossroads, where we must either take the steps needed
to prepare for this threat or become even more vulnerable. It is only a
matter of time before we are hit by a deadlier, more contagious
pandemic. Will we be ready?

#### Extinction

**Bar-Yam 16 --** Yaneer Bar-Yam, Founding President of the New England
Complex Systems Institute, "Transition to Extinction: Pandemics in a
Connected World," NECSI (July 3, 2016),
<http://necsi.edu/research/social/pandemics/transition>

Watch as one of the more aggressive---brighter red --- strains rapidly
expands. After a time it goes extinct leaving a black region. Why does
it go extinct? The answer is that it spreads so rapidly that it kills
the hosts around it. Without new hosts to infect it then dies out
itself. [That the rapidly spreading pathogens die out has important
implications for evolutionary research]{.underline} which we have talked
about elsewhere \[1--7\].

In the research I want to discuss here, [what we were interested in is
the effect of adding long range transportation]{.underline} \[8[\]. This
includes natural means of dispersal as well as unintentional dispersal
by humans, like adding airplane routes, which is being done by real
world airlines]{.underline} (Figure 2).

[When we introduce long range transportation into the model, the success
of more [aggressive strains]{.mark} changes. They can use the long range
transportation to [find]{.mark} new [hosts and **escape**]{.mark}
**local extinction**.]{.underline} Figure 3 shows that the more
transportation routes introduced into the model, the more higher
aggressive pathogens are able to survive and spread.

As we add more long range transportation, [there is a critical point at
which [pathogens become so aggressive]{.mark} that [the entire host
population dies]{.mark}.]{.underline} The pathogens die at the same
time, but that is not exactly a consolation to the hosts[. We call this
[the]{.mark} phase **[transition to extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Figure 4). [[With increasing]{.mark} levels of [global
transportation]{.mark}, human **[civilization may be approaching]{.mark}
such [a critical threshold]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In the paper we wrote in 2006 about the dangers of global transportation
for pathogen evolution and pandemics \[8\], we mentioned the risk from
Ebola. Ebola is a horrendous disease that was present only in isolated
villages in Africa. It was far away from the rest of the world only
because of that isolation. Since Africa was developing, it was only a
matter of time before it reached population centers and airports. While
the model is about evolution, it is really about which pathogens will be
found in a system that is highly connected, and Ebola can spread in a
highly connected world.

The traditional approach to public health uses historical evidence
analyzed statistically to assess the potential impacts of a disease. As
a result, many were surprised by the spread of Ebola through West Africa
in 2014. As the connectivity of the world increases, past experience is
not a good guide to future events.¶ [A key point about the phase
transition to extinction is its suddenness. Even a system that seems
stable, can be destabilized by a few more long-range connections, and
connectivity is continuing to increase.]{.underline}

[So how close are we to the tipping point? We don't know but it would be
good to find out before it happens.¶]{.underline} While Ebola ravaged
three countries in West Africa, it only resulted in a handful of cases
outside that region. One possible reason is that many of the airlines
that fly to west Africa stopped or reduced flights during the epidemic
\[9\]. In the absence of a clear connection, public health authorities
who downplayed the dangers of the epidemic spreading to the West might
seem to be vindicated.¶ As with the choice of airlines to stop flying to
west Africa, our analysis didn't take into consideration how people
respond to epidemics. It does tell us what the outcome will be [unless
we respond fast enough and well enough to stop the spread of future
diseases]{.underline}, which may not be the same as the ones we saw in
the past. [As the world becomes more connected, the dangers
increase.¶]{.underline} Are people in western countries safe because of
higher quality health systems? Countries like the U.S. have highly
skewed networks of social interactions with some very highly connected
individuals that can be "superspreaders." The chances of such an
individual becoming infected may be low but events like a mass outbreak
pose a much greater risk if they do happen. [If a sick food service
worker in an airport infects 100 passengers, or [a contagion
event]{.mark} happens in mass transportation, an outbreak [could]{.mark}
**very well [prove unstoppable]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

microbiology (Northwestern), "Tipping Point: The Threat of Antibiotic
Resistance," Helix, 8/17,

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
nearly **[[90,000]{.mark} people [die each year]{.mark}]{.underline}**
in the United States [[from]{.mark}
**[a]{.mark}**]{.underline}nti**[[b]{.underline}]{.mark}**iotic-**[[r]{.underline}]{.mark}**esistant
[bacterial infections. That is more deaths than breast and prostate
cancer]{.underline} combined. While [[MRSA]{.underline}]{.mark}
(methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) is the most publicized of
the antibiotic-resistant bacteria, it [[is]{.mark} just **[one of
many]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In fact, other bacteria that kill thousands
of people each year include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii. [These]{.underline} bacteria
[are]{.underline} all resistant to at least some antibiotics, giving
them the name "[**[superbugs]{.mark}**", [and]{.mark} the
[number]{.mark} of infections resistant **even to antibiotics of last
resort** [is increasing]{.mark}. How did this happen? We did it to
ourselves. [Antibiotics are]{.mark} omnipresent]{.underline} in the
Western world, [[overprescribed]{.mark} for patients]{.underline} who
demand them [even when they have viral infections. Then these same
[patients fail]{.mark} to take the prescription to [completion]{.mark},
allowing]{.underline} some [bacteria to survive. As a
result,]{.underline} bacterial [[resistance]{.mark} can
**[develop]{.mark} by [mutations]{.mark}**]{.underline} of genes that
antibiotics target**[, [or]{.mark} even from
[transfer]{.mark}]{.underline}** of antibiotic-resistant genes between
bacteria. [This makes bacterial infections **difficult to treat**.
Resistant bacteria multiply and spread]{.underline}, since they are able
to survive the constant antibiotic onslaught. [When a serious bacterial
infection develops, it]{.underline} is likely that the infection is due
to antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which [limits treatment options. This
is especially a problem in [hospitals]{.mark}, which [are **breeding
grounds**]{.mark} **for resistant organisms**]{.underline}. Hospitals
have a large number of susceptible people with compromised immune
systems, making a haven for sick people into a dangerous place.
Similarly, antibiotics are overused on cattle, often using them as
prophylaxis, preventative medicine, on animals that are not sick,
instead of only treating infected animals[. All of these situations
select for the bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. **[We've
reached]{.mark} a [tipping point]{.mark}**. For a while we had many
antibiotics in [our arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline} to treat bacterial
infections, [so even if treatment with one]{.underline} antibiotic
[failed, there were other options. **Unfortunately that [is]{.mark}
often [no longer true]{.mark}**[, with resistance]{.mark} emerging
[faster than]{.mark} new [therapies]{.mark}]{.underline}. The problem is
that drug companies prefer to make medication for chronic conditions,
such as cancer or heart disease, since their long-term treatment is much
more profitable. In fact, according to the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), 21 new drugs have been approved for cancer treatment since the
beginning of last year. In the same time frame, just one new bacterial
treatment has been approved. As a result, [[we are left with]{.mark}
**too few antibiotic options** and patients have to be put on
[antibiotics of last resort]{.mark}.]{.underline} These have worse side
effects and require long-term treatments. And [[even these]{.mark} drugs
sometimes **[fail]{.mark}**. This leaves us unable [to]{.mark} [treat
infections]{.mark} we **once were able to cure**]{.underline}.

Away," Time, 5/5,
<http://time.com/87767/mers-shows-that-the-next-pandemic-is-only-a-plane-flight-away/>

On Feb. 21, 2003, a 64-year-old Chinese physician named Dr. Liu Jianlun
traveled to Hong Kong to attend a wedding. He stayed in room 911 on the
ninth floor of the Metropole Hotel. Liu, who had been treating cases of
a mysterious respiratory disease in the neighboring Chinese province of
Guangdong, was already sick when he arrived in Hong Kong, and the next
day he checked into the city's Kwong Wah hospital. [[Liu]{.mark}
died]{.underline} on Mar. 4 [of]{.underline} the disease doctors soon
named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or [[SARS]{.mark}. But
before]{.underline} he died, he **[[inadvertently
infected]{.underline}]{.mark}** at least [16 people]{.underline} who
spent time on the ninth floor of that Hotel. It's [that chain of
events]{.underline} that [must have been on American officials'
minds]{.underline} last week [when news broke]{.underline} that [the
U.S. had its first case of]{.underline} Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
([[MERS]{.underline}]{.mark}). A male health care provider had been in
Saudi Arabia, the epicenter for the ongoing MERS outbreaks, before
flying to Chicago via London on Apr. 24. After arriving in Chicago, he
took a bus to the Indiana town of Munster, where on Apr. 28 he was
admitted to the hospital and was eventually diagnosed with MERS. [A
deadly respiratory disease that **has already [infected
hundreds]{.mark}**]{.underline}, almost all in Saudi Arabia, [and
killed]{.underline} over [100]{.underline} people had come to the U.S.
CDC officials played down the larger threat of the first U.S. MERS case.
"In this interconnected world we live in, we expected MERS to make its
way to the U.S.," Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC's National
Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on May
2. "We have been preparing for this." CDC officials will contact and
track individuals who might have been close to the patient --- including
health workers who treated him and fellow travelers on his international
flights and his bus ride to Munster --- just in case any developed MERS
symptoms. That's not likely. So far MERS hasn't shown much ability to
spread easily from person to person, so the threat to the larger U.S.
public is probably very small. But if that Indiana case remains isolated
--- and MERS itself never becomes the global health threat that SARS was
--- it only means we were lucky. [As Schuchat put it, [exotic]{.mark},
emerging [diseases are]{.mark} now "**just [a plane's ride
away]{.mark}**."]{.underline} In the past, [before international air
travel]{.underline} became common, emerging [pathogens could begin
infecting]{.underline} people [but remain geographically isolated for
decades]{.underline}. Scientists now think that [[HIV]{.mark} was active
among people in Central Africa for decades before it]{.underline} really
[began [spread]{.mark}ing [globally]{.mark}]{.underline} in the 1970s,
[again [thanks]{.mark} largely [to]{.mark} international air
[travel]{.mark}. Today [there's]{.mark} **almost [no spot]{.mark} on the

The analysis should aid passage of the deal, which would replace the

The commission nevertheless said that the deal\'s impact would be
\"moderate\" in light of the trade agreements already in place with
Canada and Mexico. \"Because NAFTA has already eliminated duties on most
qualifying goods and significantly reduced nontariff measures, USMCA's
emphasis is on reducing remaining nontariff measures on trade and the

**prominently**]{.underline} [in]{.underline}]{.mark}to [[the calculus
for future conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}. The findings also suggest
that security issues with economic or financial underpinnings will
transcend classical determinants of war and conflict, and change the
manner by which rival states engage in hostile acts toward one another.
The research shows that [security concerns emanating from economic
uncertainty and]{.underline} the inherent [vulnerabilities
within]{.underline} global [financial markets will present new
challenges for national security,]{.underline} and provide developing
states new asymmetric options for balancing against stronger states. The
security areas, identified in the proceeding chapters, are likely to
mature into global security threats in the immediate future. As the case
study on South Korea suggest, the overlapping security issues associated
with [[economic decline]{.underline}]{.mark} and reduced military
spending [[by the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [will affect allied

One by one, obstacles are being removed. Important talks between the
administration and congressional Democrats over lingering concerns are
ongoing, and these concerns should not be minimized. But it's also true
that [[USMCA approval has taken on]{.mark} a fierce [urgency to create
certainty in the marketplace, boost economic growth
]{.mark}]{.underline}and job creation[[, and pave the way for future
trade talks.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Certainty. An early vote for [[USMCA will provide U.S. businesses from
every sector]{.mark}---from agriculture to manufacturing and
services---[the certainty that their exports to Canada and Mexico will
enter those markets duty-free]{.mark}.]{.underline}

This certainty is invaluable because [[these two markets are
invaluable]{.mark} to American business. U.S. [trade with Canada and
Mexico]{.mark}:]{.underline}

[[Reached]{.mark} nearly \$[1.4 trillion last year]{.mark}]{.underline},
or \$3.8 billion daily;

[[Supports 12 million]{.mark} American [jobs]{.mark} spread across every

[combined]{.mark};]{.underline}

[[Accounts for]{.mark} nearly [one-third of]{.mark} U.S. [agricultural
exports]{.mark}; and]{.underline}

[Powered growth in U.S. services exports from \$27 billion in 1993 to
\$91 billion in 2017.]{.underline}

[Certainty is what American job-creators require if they are to make
brick-and-mortar investments and create more jobs for the long
haul.]{.underline}

[Growth. USMCA isn't just about holding on to what you've got. [USMCA
will boost economic growth by improving the market access guaranteed for
U.S. businesses.]{.mark}]{.underline}

For example, the agreement further opens the Canadian market to U.S.
agricultural exports such as dairy products, poultry, and wine. U.S.
farmers and ranchers have faced five years of declining commodity
prices, so USMCA's improved market access is more than welcome.

And make no mistake: These are growth markets. [U.S. [exports to Mexico
and Canada have grown more]{.mark} over the past decade [than]{.mark}
sales to [any other country]{.mark}.]{.underline} In each case, exports
have expanded by more than \$100 billion annually.

[[No other]{.mark} market [comes close.]{.mark} In fact, Mexico and
Canada accounted for about 40% of the growth in U.S. goods exports in
dollar terms over the past decade]{.underline}.

In particular, USMCA promises growth for America's small and midsized
exporters. Canada and Mexico are the top two export destinations for
U.S. small and medium-size enterprises, more than 120,000 of which sell
their goods and services in our two North American neighbors. When an
American small business starts exporting, it's almost always to Canada
or Mexico.

Modernization. USMCA also promises substantial new benefits by
modernizing the rules for commerce in North America to reflect the
realities of 21st century trade. Deferring enactment of the agreement
means deferring these benefits.

To illustrate, when NAFTA was negotiated a quarter century ago, there
was no e-commerce, so it's no surprise the agreement did not address
this booming sector. Here, USMCA's digital trade chapter sets a new,
high standard.

Beijing and the U.S. can return to the position of apparent near
alignment they enjoyed before talks appeared to stall out last month,
amid disagreements between the two economic superpowers.

Kudlow's remarks on CNBC's "The Exchange " came just days after Trump
scrapped plans to slap increasing tariffs on all Mexican goods coming
into the U.S. until Mexico took sufficient steps to stem the flow of
migrants coming to the southern U.S. border. The two countries struck an
agreement, many details of which are still unknown, on Friday after
talks in Washington.

Experts have said that imposing new tariffs on Mexico --- a move Trump
has said is still on the table --- could jeopardize the
U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, which has been approved by the
three countries' leaders. The nations' legislatures have yet to ratify
the deal.

[Kudlow's emphasis on the USMCA over the China deal indicates that Trump
aims to pressure Democrats to support ratification ahead of the 2020
election]{.underline}. Democrats, who hold the majority in the House,
have raised concerns about how the new agreement would address labor and
environmental issues, among other provisions.

"[Let me give you something that I think is more important than China,
vis-a-vis the economy," Kudlow said, referring to the USMCA. "We are
hoping that Congress will sign off on it \... [Canada and Mexico are
gigantic trading partners and]{.mark} I think [in economic terms,
that's]{.mark} probably [more important than]{.mark} the [China]{.mark}
story."]{.underline}

#### Clary relies on rare events regression, which is flawed

**Allison 12** (Paul, Ph.D., is Professor of Sociology at the University
of Pennsylvania where he teaches graduate courses in methods and
statistics, "Logistic Regression for Rare Events",
http://statisticalhorizons.com/logistic-regression-for-rare-events)

Prompted by a 2001 article by King and Zeng, many researchers worry
about whether they can legitimately use conventional logistic regression
for data in which events are rare. [Although King and Zeng accurately
described the problem and proposed an appropriate solution, **[there are
still a lot of misconceptions]{.mark} about this issue.**]{.underline}
[[The problem is not]{.underline}]{.mark} specifically **[[the rarity of
events,]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[but]{.underline}]{.mark} rather [[the
possibility of a small number of cases on the rarer of the two
outcomes.]{.underline}]{.mark} [If you have a sample size of 1000 but
only 20 events, you have a problem. If you have a sample size of 10,000
with 200 events, you may be OK. If your sample has 100,000 cases with
2000 events, you're golden.]{.underline} There's nothing wrong with the
logistic model in such cases. The problem is that maximum likelihood
estimation of the logistic model is well-known to suffer from
small-sample bias. And the degree of bias is strongly dependent on the
number of cases in the less frequent of the two categories. So **[[even
with a sample size of 100,000, if there are only 20 events in the
sample, you may have substantial bias]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

**Tir 10** (Jaroslav, PhD, professor of political science at University
of Colorado at Boulder, "Territorial Diversion: Diversionary Theory of
War and Territorial Conflict," The Journal of Politics, Vol. 72, No. 2,
April 2010, pp. 413--425)

Hypothesis 1 thus receives strong support via the unpopularity variable
but only weak support via the economic growth variable. These [[results
suggest]{.mark} that embattled leaders are much more likely to respond
with territorial diversions to direct signs of their
unpopularity]{.underline} (e.g., strikes, protests, riots) [than to
general background conditions such as economic malaise.]{.underline}
Presumably, protesters can be distracted via territorial diversions
while ﬁxing the economy would take a more concerted and prolonged policy
effort. **[[Bad economic conditions]{.mark} seem to [motivate]{.mark}
only [the most serious, fatal territorial
confrontations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This implies that leaders may be
reserving the most high-proﬁle and risky diversions for the times when
they are the most desperate, that is [[when their power is threatened
both by signs of discontent with their rule and by more systemic
problems plaguing the country (i.e., an underperforming
economy).]{.mark} Next, I conduct a series of [follow-up
tests]{.mark}]{.underline} suggested by an anonymous Reviewer; results
based on the reanalysis of Model 1 are presented in the online appendix.
[Evaluating the implication that territorial diversions]{.underline} are
indeed **[more likely to result from diversionary conditions than
nonterritorial diversions]{.underline}**, I set up a multinomial logit
model that contrasts the initiation of territorial MIDs versus
nonterritorial MIDs (base outcome). The results show a positive and
statistically signiﬁcant coefﬁcient for the government unpopularity
variable (ﬁrst column of Table 3), meaning that higher levels of
government unpopularity are more likely to produce territorial rather
than nonterritorial MIDs. [Further checks]{.underline} **[[include
performing rare events logit]{.underline}]{.mark}** (King and Zeng 2001)
**[[and population-averaged logit analyses to verify whether the rare
events nature of the dependent variable or cross-sectional
characteristics of the data alter the ﬁndings,
respectively]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[The ﬁndings]{.underline}]{.mark}
[for the two independent variables]{.underline} **[[remain
unchanged]{.underline}]{.mark}** (see Table 3, columns two and three).
Finally, protesting behavior in more populous countries could be
considered more ''normal'' and less threatening to the government,
potentially lowering the incentive to divert. Dividing the government
unpopularity variable by the log of country's population (from the
Correlates of War National Capabilities data set, Singer 1987) reveals
that the population size-standardized government unpopularity variable
remains positive and signiﬁcant; see Table 3, ﬁnal column. Concerning
the control variables, the effects of power and distance are consistent
with expectations and across the Models in Table 1. Democracy, alliance
ties, and trade coefﬁcients have mostly the expected dampening inﬂuence
on territorial conﬂict initiation; but only trade exhibits a signiﬁcant
impact and only when the dependent variable is the fatal territorial MID
(i.e., in Models 3--4). 16 These results are somewhat surprising, but
the reader is reminded that the effects of alliance are highly contested
(see Maoz 2000), while the impact of trade has not been established in
the domain of territorial conﬂict. Similarly, recent research shows that
the [democratic peace weakens considerably in the context of territorial
conﬂict]{.underline} (James, Park, and Choi 2006) [and that the
democratic peace may be epiphenomenal to territorial peace]{.underline}
(Gibler 2007). [17 Importantly, the control variable results imply that
some of the related interests]{.underline} (e.g., security, regime ties)
[may indeed be subordinated to the territorial diversion impetus.
Revisiting the link between regime type and diversion, some scholars
argue that democratic leaders have a greater
motivation]{.underline}---due to the need for popular support---[for
diversion]{.underline} (e.g., Gelpi 1997; Russett 1990; Smith 1996).
[Yet, others]{.underline} (e.g., Downs and Rocke 1994; Miller 1995;
Pickering and Kisangani 2005) [assert that authoritarian leaders need
popular support in order to appear legitimate.]{.underline} Because they
cannot derive legitimacy from democratic institutions and elections,
they look to diversions to help them achieve this goal. Autocrats can
also divert with greater impunity due to the lack of institutional
checks and balances. In follow-up tests available from the online
appendix, Table 4, I restrict the set of initiator countries in Model 1
to democracies only, autocracies only, all nondemocracies, and all
nonautocracies. That [the [ﬁndings]{.mark} hold [suggest]{.mark}s **that
[both democratic and autocratic leaders value territorial
diversions]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Nevertheless, resolving the broader
debate is beyond the scope of this study.

#### Lots of conflicts from economic decline

Namsuk **Kim**, policy specialist at United Nations Development
Programme, Office of Development Studies and Pedro Conceição, Director
of the Office of Development Studies, at UNPD, "THE ECONOMIC CRISIS,
VIOLENT CONFLICT, AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT", International Journal of Peace
Studies, Volume 15, Number 1, Spring/Summer 20**10**

A recent strand of literature, reviewed in some detail in this paper,
suggests that [[economic conditions are important **determinants
of**]{.mark} **the [outbreak]{.mark}**]{.underline} and recurrence
[**[of]{.underline}** **[conflict]{.underline}**]{.mark}. In particular,
[[wars]{.underline}]{.mark} **[often [start]{.mark} [following]{.mark}
growth [collapses]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Collier et al., 2009, p. 15).
[Sharp [economic slowdowns]{.mark}]{.underline} and low levels of income
per capita [appear to]{.underline} **[[increase]{.mark} the likelihood
of [conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In this context, it is opportune
to explore insights from this literature, linking it also with the human
development implications of both growth slowdowns and conflict. In
particular, the paper highlights the risks of the emergence of low human
development/conflict traps. When it comes to the consequences of
conflict, there is no doubt that violent conflict is one of the most
extreme forms of suppressing choices and advancing rights, and therefore
a major threat to human development (UNDP, 2005, p. 151). Since 1990,
**[more than 3 million people have died]{.underline}** in armed
conflicts in developing countries (Marshall, 2005). The total war deaths
are far more than the battle deaths. For example, the total war deaths
are estimated as 1.2 million in Ethiopia during 1976-1991, but only 2%
of them were directly engaged in the battles. (Lacina and Gleditsch,
2004). Conflict has also non-lethal consequences that may last across
generations (UNDP, 2008a). The conflict becomes even more hazardous if
conflict results in a persistent conflict trap. A typical country
reaching the end of a civil war faces a 44 percent risk of returning to
conflict within five years (Collier et al., 2003, p. 83). Whether or not
a country will experience a new civil war can be best predicted by
whether the country experienced wars in the past (Collier et al., 2004).
As far as drivers of conflict are concerned, one of [the [most robust
findings in]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[lit]{.mark}erature
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} that many [[economic
conditions]{.underline}]{.mark} (low income, slow growth, and especially
severe economic downturns) **[[are correlated with the outbreak of
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [with]{.underline} some
[evidence]{.underline} **[strongly [suggesting]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[that the [causal direction]{.mark} runs from economic conditions to
conflict]{.underline} (Collier and Hoeffler, 2004). There is also a rich
literature on the impact of horizontal inequality and dependence on
natural resources as drivers of increases in the risk of conflict. [A
simple]{.underline} and narrow [approach]{.underline} to the conflict
related to economic growth **[might overlook]{.underline}** other
dimensions of **[human nature.]{.underline}** It is true that the high
rates of recurrence of conflict, along with the economic determinants of
conflict, suggest the possibility of the existence of poverty-conflict
traps (Collier et al., 2003; Bloomberg et al., 2000). However, poverty
and low per capita income are also correlated with worse health and
education outcomes, and also these outcomes suffer as a result of
conflict, (Collier and Hoeffler, 2004; Justino and Verwimp, 2006;
Alderman, Hoddinott and Kinsey, 2004). Therefore, the relationship
between conflict and human development can be conceptualized in the
framework of a low human development -- conflict trap.

#### Drezner concludes neg

**Drezner 14** -- Daniel Drezner, IR prof at Tufts, The System Worked:
Global Economic Governance during the Great Recession, World Politics,
Volume 66. Number 1, January 2014, pp. 123-164

IX\. **[[Conclusion]{.underline}]{.mark}**

When the subprime mortgage crisis began, [there were rampant fears that
global economic governance was too dysfunctional and unprepared to cope
with a severe crisis]{.underline}. The Great Recession then exacerbated
those fears. A review of policy outcomes, outputs, and processes shows a
different picture. Global trade and investment levels have recovered
from the plunge that occurred in late 2008. A mélange of international
coordination mechanisms facilitated the provision of key policy outputs
from 2008 onward. Existing global governance structures, particularly in
finance, have been revamped to accommodate shifts in the distribution of
power. [The [evidence suggests]{.mark} that [multilateral institutions
adapted]{.mark} and responded to the 2008 financial crisis in a robust
fashion. They passed the stress test]{.underline}---global economic
governance has been good enough. The picture presented here is at odds
with prevailing conventional wisdom on this subject.

[[This does **not** guarantee]{.mark} that [global]{.mark} economic
[governance will]{.mark} continue to [function effectively **going
forward**]{.mark}. It is worth remembering that [there were genuine
efforts]{.mark} to provide global public goods [in 1929 as well, but
they]{.mark} eventually **[fizzled]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
[[failure]{.mark} of the major economies to assist]{.underline} the
Austrian government after the CreditAnstalt bank failed in 1931 [[led to
a cascade]{.mark} of bank failures]{.underline} across Europe and the
United States. [The collapse of the]{.underline} 1933 [London conference
guaranteed an ongoing absence of policy coordination for the next
several years. The start of [the Great Depression]{.mark} was bad, but
international policy coordination failures made it worse. Such a
scenario **[could play out again]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### a2: economy resilient

#### US economy not resilient to major crashes

**Hughes 16** (Robert, Senior Research Fellow @ American Institute for
Economic Research, 3/22, \"An Economy, Growing But Vulnerable,\"
https://www.aier.org/blog/economy-growing-vulnerable)

[The [economic outlook is]{.mark} modestly [upbeat, **but rife with
risks**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As we approach the seventh anniversary of
the end of the worst recession since the Great Depression, [the economy
has made substantial progress]{.underline}. There are reasons to believe
that later this year [businesses could feel more confidence]{.underline}
in hiring and making other investments. **[But [obstacles
remain]{.mark}]{.underline}**. First, let's look at the economy right
now. On the positive side, the labor market has made substantial
progress recovering from the severe job losses in 2008 and 2009. The
unemployment rate is below 5 percent, and net job creation has averaged
over 200,000 per month for the past five years. In addition, employers
are trying to fill more than 5.5 million open positions across the
country. Despite the progress, gains in hourly earnings remain modest.
On the negative side, [the U.S. dollar has appreciated]{.underline}
against most currencies, making our exports more expensive and imports
cheaper, both of which are bad for U.S. manufacturers, though cheaper
imports generally benefit consumers by keeping prices low. [An
additional drag is that economic [growth in many countries around the
world remains subpar]{.mark}]{.underline}, further depressing demand for
U.S. exports. The collapse in commodity prices, particularly energy, is
a double-edged sword for the overall economy. Lower energy prices are
helpful to consumers and some industries (think, transportation and
shipping), but have hurt the domestic energy production industry. With
that basic backdrop, the policy makers at the Federal Reserve have begun
raising short-term interest rates. Signals from the Federal Open Market
Committee (FOMC, the group responsible for setting monetary policy)
suggest further rate increases will come, though at an extremely slow
pace given the shaky economic backdrop and benign outlook for inflation.
How do these trends translate to an outlook for the second half of 2016?
Overall, not too badly. [[The U.S. economy is]{.mark} still [driven by
the consumer.]{.mark} [The]{.mark} slowly [improving]{.mark} labor
[market, combined with lower energy prices]{.mark} and improved
household balance sheets, [provide a]{.mark} solid [foundation for
consumer]{.mark}s to continue [spending]{.mark}]{.underline}. A
reasonably healthy consumer combined with low interest rates should help
support activity in the housing market, particularly as the important
spring and summer selling season approaches. [[If consumers do push
ahead with spending]{.mark} and home purchases, [that will]{.mark}
likely [give confidence to businesses]{.mark} to continue hiring and
boost investment, **[sustaining a virtuous cycle to keep the economy
growing]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [That's the optimistic
outlook]{.underline}, and in our view, [the likely path]{.underline}.
[[However]{.underline}]{.mark}, any number of **[[things could turn the
virtuous cycle into a vicious cycle]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The latest
reading from our Business Cycle Conditions model suggests a note of
caution. The Leaders Index -- [[our compilation of]{.mark} economic
[indicators that]{.mark} help [forecast]{.mark} the health of [the
economy -- had a value of 50]{.mark}]{.underline} (on a scale of 0 to
100) in the latest month, **[[exactly neutral]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Generally, persistent readings below 50 would indicate an increased
probability of recession in the next 6 to 12 months. So, according to
our model, [while we don't expect a recession in the immediate future,
**[the economy is]{.mark} somewhat [vulnerable]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
There are a number of factors that could make an impact in such a state
of vulnerability. For instance, the Fed could raise rates too quickly.
[Consumers could lose confidence and slow spending, or [businesses could
lose confidence]{.mark} and slow or stop hiring, or cut back on
investment]{.underline}. We could be faced with an unforeseen
geopolitical event. **[[If one]{.mark} or some combination [of these
occur, it could tip]{.mark} our model and [the economy into a new
recession]{.mark}]{.underline}**. There is always some ebb and flow to
economic activity, and when those ebbs and flows happen while overall
growth is modest, [the risk of a recession can rise. **The economy
becomes more vulnerable, [policy decisions become]{.mark} more
[important, and the potential impact of some shock to the system becomes
magnified.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[Women]{.underline}]{.mark} and girls [[pay the

[The [threat of soaring prices was]{.mark} particularly [challenging for
those whose]{.mark} rural [livelihoods were already
precarious]{.mark}]{.underline}. These affected food producers as well
as consumers, as the overwhelming majority of small-scale farmers are
net food buyers. The prohibitive cost of inputs (fertilizers, fuel,
etc.) offset any opportunities higher output prices might have created.

Because [[ag]{.underline}]{.mark}ricultural [[gender inequalities remain
strong, women farmers are particularly at risk of hunger]{.mark},
especially [when crisis strikes]{.mark}. On average, rural women account
for nearly half the agricultural workforce in developing countries.
Despite their crucial roles in household food security, they face
discrimination and limited bargaining power.]{.underline} Patriarchal
norms create disadvantages for women farmers, specifically in land
rights (small plots, difficulties attaining ownership, discriminatory
inheritance rights), productive resources (no access to credit,
extension services or inputs), unpaid work, insecure employment and
exclusion from decision making and political representation. Within the
household, because of weaker bargaining position [[they]{.mark}
frequently [eat least]{.mark}, last and least
[well]{.mark}.]{.underline} Women farmers who control resources
generally have better-quality diets.

[[Women are vulnerable on all dimensions]{.mark} of food
security:]{.underline} availability, access, utilization and stability.
They suffer the most from macro- and micronutrient deficiencies,
especially during reproductive years, with long-term negative
development impacts for society as a whole.

[[Food-price spikes have]{.mark} negative [repercussions for female
household heads]{.mark}.]{.underline} They suffer labour market
discrimination, which confines them to informal and casual employment,
as well as pay inequity. Also, they frequently spend a bigger share of
their family budget on food than male heads of household.

Women's coping strategies

In times of crisis, poor households face asset losses and lower incomes.
Men have more access to social capital and pathways out of crisis (their
income pays past debts and secures new farm loans), whereas women often
face severe time burdens, given their household food-security roles. As
they usually have a weak bargaining position with regard to household
income, they frequently must reduce spending on nutrition and family
well-being. Indeed, households adjust to reduced food purchasing power
by shifting to cheaper, less diverse diets. [[Women]{.mark} tend to
[buffer]{.mark} the impact [through extreme strategies]{.mark}: reducing
their own consumption to feed others, collecting wild food, migrating or
selling assets, and even taking on risky jobs.]{.underline}

[[Sudden Food Price Rise]{.mark}s Can [Trigger
Conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}

[An [unexpected]{.mark} or higher-than-normal [rise in]{.mark} food
[prices]{.mark}, which has an immediate impact on purchasing power and
thus access to food, [has]{.mark} already [been noted as a **key
mechanism** linking food insecurity and conflict]{.mark}. Food prices
can rise rapidly in response to shifts]{.underline} in global markets,
local shortfalls in supply that cannot be or are not compensated by
trade, or deliberate changes in policies, especially those that lead to
the removal of subsidies or price controls. Such price increases often
bring protesting people into the streets. [Food protests---sometimes
peaceful, sometimes violent---ensue.]{.underline}

Food riots have a long history. Prior to the French Revolution in 1789,
protests were directed at producers, traders, and merchants with the
goal of forcing them to lower food prices. Since the French Revolution,
however, [[food riots have become]{.mark} more [political]{.mark} in
nature and are largely an urban phenomenon (Bellemare, 2011).
[Protests]{.mark}]{.underline} against extraordinary increases in the
price of rice (and, to a lesser extent, the prices of wheat and corn)
[led to a number of outbreaks of civil unrest in 2007 and
2008.]{.underline} Most involved nonviolent [demonstrations that lasted
a few days at most. Others [turned violent]{.mark} and resulted in
deaths]{.underline}. Demonstrations have continued sporadically from
2008 to the present as price volatility continues to affect global
commodity markets and as national governments react to international
price changes in different ways.

Marc Bellemare (2011) has explored the causal pathways between rising
food prices, the volatility of food prices, and political unrest. Using
monthly information on global food and cereal prices and newspaper
reports of food riots from January 1990 to January 2011, he concludes
that [[rising]{.mark} food [prices]{.mark}, and specifically cereal
prices, [caused political unrest]{.mark}]{.underline}, but that price
volatility did not.

Marco Lagi et al. (2011) examined the coincidence of [[high]{.mark}
global food [prices]{.mark} in 2011 and the riots that [led to]{.mark}
the revolutions of [the Arab Spring]{.mark}]{.underline}. They conclude
that [[it was highly likely]{.mark} that,]{.underline} while there were
many other factors in play, [high food [prices were a]{.mark}
precipitating [condition for]{.mark} the [unrest]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The potential for protests to become violent likely depends on
contextual factors such as perceived government effectiveness and
average income levels. For example, in recent research Joachim von Braun
noted that the ratio of violent to nonviolent food price-related
protests in 2008 was higher in low-income countries and in countries
with lower government effectiveness (von Braun, 2008; Brinkman &
Hendrix, 2011). There were 19 food protests in low-income countries, and
11 involved violence. Of the 15 protests in lower-middle-income
countries, only 7 were violent; of the 6 protests in upper-middle-income
countries, 2 were violent; and of the 9 food protests in upper-income
countries, none were violent (Torero,2008). Rabah Arezki and Markus
Brückner (2011) also show statistically that [[increases in
international]{.mark} food [prices lead to]{.mark} greater incidence of
anti-government [demonstrations, riots, and civil conflict]{.mark} in
low-income countries,]{.underline} but not in higher-income countries.

Many have explained these differential responses by pointing to the
higher relative share of household income devoted to food in
lower-income countries (FAO, 2011). Any price change that reduces their
purchasing power has a relatively greater impact on their food security.
Brett L. Carter and Robert Bates (2012) introduce another perspective on
the relationship between rising food prices and food riots. They look
not only at the initial impact of the price increases but also at the
result of governments' efforts to mitigate them. They examine how price
rises---due not just to changes in global food prices but also to
changes in government policies, exchange rate variations, and so
on---contribute to the potential for creating unrest and civil war.
[[They find that **food price shocks alone** increase]{.mark} the
likelihood of [conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, when they expand
the analysis to take into account governments' responses to the price
shocks, they find that governments tend to implement policies that favor
urban consumers and the probability of instability disappears. Urban
consumers, they conclude, are both more sensitive to price changes for
their staple commodities and better able to influence policy through
their protest actions.

[[Competition for Food]{.underline}]{.mark} Production Resources [Can
[Catalyze Recurrent Conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Water, land for cultivation, and grazing lands are contested resources
in many regions of the world. Communal [conflict is]{.mark} often
[associated with localized competition]{.mark} among rural groups within
a country, each seeking to ensure adequate access to production
resources and, through the use of these resources, to their food
security]{.underline}. Cattle-rustling, land grabs, and the diversion of
water resources are signs of such conflict and communities' inabilities
to negotiate acceptable compromises peacefully.1

When weather conditions result in drought or flooding or when population
growth and in-migration add new stresses, [[farmers]{.mark} and herders
[who see their food security]{.mark} and livelihoods [threatened]{.mark}
may [escalate conflict]{.mark} to the point of violent
clashes]{.underline}. Colin H. Kahl (2006) finds that there is much to
suggest that "rapid population growth, environmental degradation, and
competition over natural resources play important causal roles" in civil
strife, although he does not draw a direct link to (or through) the food
security status of those participating in the conflict.

Henk-Jan Brinkman and Cullen S. Hendrix (2011, p. 8) also note that
[communal conflicts over scarce resources, particularly land and water,
have involved groups with permanent or semi-permanent armed militias and
have been particularly important in recent cases of violent clashes in
Kenya, Nigeria, the Sudan, and Uganda:]{.underline}

[Repeated clashes between Fulani herders and Tarok farmers in Nigeria's
Plateau State killed 843 people in 2004. Similar clashes between
Rizeigat Abbala and Terjam herders in the Sudan killed 382 in 2007.
Cattle raiding in the Karamoja]{.underline}

[cluster, a cross-border region of Ethiopian, Kenyan, and Ugandan
territory, resulted in more than 600 deaths and the loss of 40,000 heads
of livestock in 2004 alone.]{.underline}

And in August 2012, the farming Pokomo and cattle-herding Orma groups in
Kenya instigated a violent conflict over access to the water and
riparian lands of the Tana River. Newspaper reports indicate that the
collapse of irrigation schemes along the river had reduced employment
and incomes for the Pokomo and catalyzed the resurgence of a
long-running conflict between the groups ("Kenya to Disarm Tribes,"
2012).

Water is a unique natural resource that can affect food security in many
ways. Sandra L. Postel and Aaron T. Wolf (2001, p. 2) warn that "unlike
oil and most other strategic resources, fresh water has no substitute in
most of its uses. It is essential for growing food, manufacturing goods,
and safeguarding human health.... Whether or not water scarcity causes
outright warfare between nations in the years ahead, it already causes
enough violence and conflict within nations to threaten social and
political stability."

[[Inequities Affecting Food Security]{.mark} Can Exacerbate Grievances
and [Build]{.mark} Momentum Toward [Conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Perceived social, political, or economic [inequities that affect
people's access to food]{.mark} can [exacerbate]{.mark} grievances that,
in combination with other factors, appear to build momentum toward
[conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} Messer and Cohen (2006, p. 15) note that
"historically, most individuals, households, communities, and peoples
denied access to resources adequate to feed themselves and to live their
lives with dignity have failed to rebel because they are (1)
insufficiently organized and (2) overly terrorized and repressed."
However, they continue, "\[t\]hese conditions of unchanneled frustration
and hopelessness can lead to violence and conflict once there emerges
political leadership that can successfully mobilize this discontent in
ways that serve a leader or group's particular political ends, usually
articulated as a struggle for social justice or political identity."

[The grievance linkage between food insecurity and civil conflict seems
to be of particular importance in resource-rich countries,]{.underline}
where the wealth and benefits of an exported natural resource (e.g.,
oil) are subject to elite

capture or corruption and do not translate into greater food security
for all.

Brinkman and Hendrix (2011, pp. 5--6) concur in this view, noting that
"\[s\]ome of the countries most plagued by conflict the past 20 years
are characterized by widespread hunger, such as Angola, DRC \[Democratic
Republic of Congo\], Papua New Guinea, and Sierra Leone. The mixture of
hunger---which creates grievances---and the availability of valuable
commodities--- which can provide opportunities for rebel funding---is a
volatile combination."

Droughts in northern Mali led to reductions in food supply in the 1970s
and 1980s. The greater food insecurity that resulted did not directly
lead to conflict. Tor Benjaminsen (2008) argues, however, that the
scarcity of food led to the migration of young men to Algeria and Libya,
where they became exposed to revolutionary discourses. They returned to
Mali to support an incipient rebellion launched by the nomads and
Tuaregs of northern Mali, who believed that they were being unfairly
treated by the national government, including being forced to settle in
towns and villages rather than continuing their nomadic lifestyle.
"Embezzlement of drought relief funds by government officials in Bamako
added further to the anger felt by the young men who took up arms
against the Malian state," writes Benjaminsen (2008, p. 819). Thus,
[[reduced availability of food]{.mark} and perceived inequities in
systems intended to increase access to food combined with a complex set
of cultural and political drivers to [ignite]{.mark} violent
[conflict]{.mark} in northern Mali.]{.underline}

[[Food Insecurity]{.mark} May [Give Individuals Incentives to
Join]{.mark} or Support [Conflicts]{.mark} and Rebellions]{.underline}

[Poverty-based food insecurity may give incentives to
individuals]{.underline}---likely, in Paul Collier et al.'s (2008)
analysis, to be unemployed or underemployed young men[--- to join
conflicts and rebellions. [By participating in]{.mark} the [conflict,
they increase their chances of]{.mark} securing production resources
(land, financial assets) through predation and/or acquisition of the
spoils of conflict, thereby [increasing their]{.mark} [food
security.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Anecdotal information suggests this to be the case in countries where
population growth has resulted in a "bulge" of poorly educated rural
youths who see little prospect of gaining resources through other means.
Studies of demobilized combatants in Sierra Leone Where weak
post-conflict governments are unable to provide either agricultural
inputs, health care, or food safety nets to impoverished and
food-insecure populations, the opportunity costs for individuals to join
efforts to reignite conflict are low because little is forfeited by
shifting towards insurgency. Harvesting Peace: Food Security, Conflict,
and Cooperation 21 and Liberia provide some evidence that such
opportunities for material gain for young people played a role in recent
civil wars in those countries (Brinkman & Hendrix, 2011).

[Micro-level research shows that households and communities take steps
to protect their food security when conflict is imminent or already
ongoing]{.underline}. Patricia Justino and others have found that
households appear to initiate different strategies to mitigate the
impact of conflict on their food security: staying neutral, moving (or
escaping), being altruistic and providing assistance to others, or
[actively participating in the conflict and attempting to improve one's
own conditions]{.underline} (Justino, 2009; Verwimp, 2011; Zetter &
Verwimp, 2011).

While neutrality, or "sitting on the fence," appears to be the option
preferred by most households, even when successful this strategy often
results in malnutrition, a gradual depletion of assets as economic
opportunities are constrained, and increased poverty. There are,
therefore, strong incentives---[rooted in the quest for food
security---for individuals and households to participate in or actively
support violent conflict. The hope of protecting or even improving their
food security leads some households to seek the protection of local
armed factions to increase their chances of survival as they continue to
farm their land.]{.underline} They might even increase their chances of
acquiring more land or opportunities to better their future food
security by offering their support (food, some labor, etc.) to the armed
groups (Justino, 2009).

[[Food Insecurity]{.mark} May Help to [Sustain
Conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Food insecurity may play a role in sustaining conflict as [it becomes
part of]{.mark} a vicious circle of recurring [instability]{.mark} and
civil strife]{.underline}. The 2011 WDR cites "the challenge of repeated
cycles of violence" as the top challenge for the global community in the
21st century. Rather than following the old linear paradigm of conflict
(escalation of dispute, full-scale hostilities, victory or defeat,
postconflict phase, peace), the WDR asserts that the [new paradigm
involves repeated violence, weak governance, and instability (World
Bank, 2011b). In this view:]{.underline}

\[C\]onflicts often are not one-off events, but are ongoing and
repeated: 90 percent of the last decade's civil wars occurred in
countries that had already had a civil war in the last 30 years....
\[N\]ew forms of conflict and violence \[such as crime\] threaten
development... \[and\] different forms of violence are linked to each
other.... International ideological movements make common cause with
local grievances... \[and\] grievances can escalate into acute demands
for change---and the risks of violent conflict---in countries where
political, social or economic change lags behind expectations, as in the
Middle East and North Africa.

[Since evidence shows that conflict leads to food insecurity, it seems
likely, in this new perspective on conflict, that continued food
[insecurity]{.mark} could well [contribute to]{.mark} continuing or
restarting [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. Where agricultural production
assets have been destroyed, for example, the difficulties of regaining
higher productivity levels may affect availability of food supplies or
incomes (and thus food access), especially when export commodities are
involved.

Where weak post-conflict governments are unable to provide either
agricultural inputs, health care, or food safety nets to impoverished
and food-insecure populations, the [opportunity costs for individuals to
join efforts to reignite conflict are low because little is forfeited by
shifting towards insurgency]{.underline}. Social or political inequities
that affect the potential for regaining food security and are
unaddressed by government may also help to maintain a cycle of conflict.
[[External price shocks]{.mark} that are not buffered by government
action could again [trigger]{.mark} or catalyze actions that could
refuel [conflicts]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Collapse in the U.S. goes global -- global food infrastructure is [highly sensitive]{.underline}

Michael J. **Puma and** Peter B. **de Menocal** 2 March **2017**
\[Michael J. Puma is a research scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute
for Space Studies and a Center for Climate and Life Fellow. Peter B. de
Menocal is dean of science and faculty of Arts and Sciences at Columbia
University and director of the Center for Climate and Life; "Trump's
Unifying Opportunity: Food Security";
http://climateandlife.columbia.edu/2017/03/02/trumps-unifying-opportunity-food-security/\]

The reality is that Trump's coming transformation of U.S. trade policies
will inevitably lead to changes in food security that dwarf even the
most substantial of outcomes from the bipartisan Global Food Security
Act. Why? First, [[the U.S. is a world superpower when it comes to
global food production]{.underline}]{.mark}, so [[any shift in U.S.
ag]{.underline}]{.mark}riculture policy [[can have significant
consequences]{.underline}]{.mark} both at home and
[[abroad]{.underline}]{.mark}. But there is more to the story than just
U.S. trade policy changes. It turns out that [[our global food system is
highly sensitive]{.underline}]{.mark} --- even to small changes[[. A
minor disruption in the U.S. food supply could]{.underline}]{.mark}
potentially [[produce cascading effects that spread rapidly and cause a
major shock to the system]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The world experienced
this type of sensitivity]{.underline}]{.mark} firsthand when, much like
a flu epidemic, food riots spread from country to country in Africa and
other developing countries [[during the global food crisis of
2007/2008]{.underline}]{.mark}. Wheat and corn prices doubled over about
two years prior to the crisis, and rice prices tripled over just a few
months in late 2007 and early 2008. Economists continue to debate what
caused these price spikes, offering explanations that include long-run
drivers like greater biofuel demand and changes in Asian diets together
with short-run factors such as trade restrictions, speculation, and
depreciation of the U.S. dollar, hoarding, and panic purchases.
Unfortunately, it turns out that "[[tipping points]{.underline}]{.mark}"
leading to such crises (a term popularized by the author Malcolm
Gladwell) [[are generally unpredictable]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Yet the
severe effects of the food-price spike]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[which
included increases in poverty]{.underline}]{.mark} and malnourishment
[[as well as violent protests]{.underline}]{.mark} in multiple
countries, [[are clear]{.underline}]{.mark}. Importantly, the 2007/2008
crisis was not isolated to the developing world. [[Even in the U.S.,
food prices spiked, leading to hardship for many everyday
Americans]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} economic [[effects of higher food prices are
clear]{.underline}]{.mark}: Since 2007, higher [prices have put a brake
on two decades of steady process in reducing world hunger]{.underline}.
But the [[spikes in food prices]{.underline}]{.mark} over the past
decade [[have]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[thrust food issues back onto
the security agenda]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[particularly after
the]{.underline}]{.mark} events of [[the Arab
Spring]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[**High food prices** were one of the
factors pushing people into the streets]{.underline}]{.mark} during the
regionwide political turmoil that began in late 2010. Similar dynamics
were at play in 2007-2008, when near-record prices led to food-related
protests and riots in 48 countries. To what extent might high or rising
[[food prices be a source of political instability]{.underline}]{.mark}?
Food prices are the quintessential "kitchen table issue," important even
to those with no interest in politics. They're [[especially salient in
lower-income countries,]{.underline}]{.mark} where food-related
expenditures often surpass 50 percent of household income. [[Unlike
energy and electronics]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[demand for basic
foodstuffs is income-inelastic]{.underline}]{.mark}: Whether I have
adequate income has no effect on my need for sustenance. Not
surprisingly, 97 percent of the post-2007 'food riots' identified by a
team at the New England Complex Systems Institute occurred in Africa and
Asia, which are home to more than 92 percent of the world's poor and
chronically food-insecure. Careful [[empirical work bears out this
conventional wisdom]{.underline}]{.mark}: [[High global food prices
are]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[destabilizing in low-income
countries]{.underline}]{.mark}, where per capita incomes are lower.
Poverty isn't the whole story, however. [[Food is an inherently
political commodity]{.underline}]{.mark} and has been recognized as so
for millennia. Nearly 2,000 ago, the Roman poet Juvenal noted that
[[providing bread and circuses was an effective means of securing urban
stability]{.underline}]{.mark}. In a recently published article in the
Journal of Peace Research, we studied the relationship between food
prices and urban unrest in Africa and Asia over 1961-2010, which
included a period of price spikes in the 1970s. Our objective was to
tease out how political institutions might affect the propensity for
mass mobilization and protest. Politics might affect the relationship
between food prices and protest through two channels. The first is the
extent to which governments shield urban consumers from high global
prices. Governments in developing countries often subsidize food
purchases, especially those of urban dwellers, shifting welfare from
rural producers to urban consumers. But this observation raises the
second-order question of the conditions under which governments will
subsidize urban consumers. We hypothesized that autocratic governments
were more likely to shield urban consumers. While urban dwellers can
riot in the absence of elections, rural dwellers have fewer channels
through which they can voice grievances. Protest is also affected by the
political opportunity structure: the opportunities for civil society to
organize and mobilize. Famine in North Korea may have claimed as many as
a million lives during the first half of the 1990s, but no rioting or
demonstrations occurred in Pyongyang. Meanwhile, food-related protests
are routine in more open systems such as India, where comparatively
small price movements in the presence of ample stocks routinely bring
trade unions into the streets. Our empirical analysis concluded that
[[democracies]{.underline}]{.mark} and to a lesser extent anocracies (or
"hybrid regimes" that combine democratic and authoritarian elements)
[[experience more urban unrest in times of high
prices]{.underline}]{.mark}; there is no relationship between food
prices and urban unrest in autocracies. However, is this outcome [[the
result of]{.mark}]{.underline} more pro-rural policies in
[[democracies]{.underline}]{.mark} or a more liberal environment for
protest? We found that democracies and anocracies did enact more
pro-rural food policy. In particular, democracies in Africa and Asia
enact policies that favor urban areas less and rural areas more. These
[[take the form of]{.underline}]{.mark} enhancing farmer incomes and
[[raising consumer prices]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[which often causes
protests and rioting]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Lessening urban
bias]{.underline}]{.mark} in food policy may be good pro-poor policy,
given the continued concentration of poverty in rural areas, but it
[[carries political risks]{.underline}]{.mark}. What of the Arab Spring?
These [[popular uprisings seem to challenge our
findings]{.underline}]{.mark}, because they reflected autocracies that
failed to pacify restive urban populations. However, it was not for lack
of trying. Rather, [[the Arab Spring reflects some of the risks
autocratic leaders face when attempting to insulate urban
consumers]{.underline}]{.mark} from global market prices. Consumer
subsidies have long been part of the "authoritarian bargain" between the
state and citizens in the Middle East and North Africa, and attempts to
withdraw them have been met with protest before: Egypt's bread intifada,
which erupted over an attempt to reform food subsidies, killed 800 in
1977. These [[subsidies explicitly encouraged
citizens]{.underline}]{.mark} across the region [[to evaluate their
governments' effectiveness in terms of their ability to maintain low
consumer prices]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[prices
that]{.underline}]{.mark}, given these countries' dependence on food
imports, [[those governments ultimately could not
control]{.underline}]{.mark}.

**This culminates in [food wars]{.underline} in the global south that
lead [governmental collapse]{.underline} and further violence that
exacerbates in the initial shortages---impact defense doesn't assume
[empirics]{.underline} and [expert consensus]{.underline}**

[[Food]{.underline}]{.mark} and economic
[[insecurity]{.underline}]{.mark} and natural resource scarcities . .
.[[can be major sources of conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. When
politically dominant groups seize land and food resources, deny access
to other culturally or economically marginalized groups, and cause
hunger and scarcities, violence often arises. [[In
Ethiopia]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[Rwanda]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and
Sudan]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[food crises]{.underline}]{.mark} resulting
from drought and mismanagement of agriculture and relief and development
aid [[led to rebellion and government collapse]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[followed by **even greater**]{.underline}]{.mark} food
[[**shortfalls** in ensuing years of conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Denial of the right to food has been linked to uprisings and civil war
in Central America and Mexico. [[Food insecurity is also integral to
civil conflicts in Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}. Competition for resources
has generated cycles of hunger and hopelessness that have bred violence
in Sri Lanka as well as Rwanda.\" These afflicted regions are generally
places disconnected from the global economic mainstream, where
strong-man governments arise and just as quickly crumble, having only
political quicksand on which to build a foundation for stability and
progress. This is vital to an understanding of what is going wrong with
global food production: [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} nearly all [[these
countries]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[food is of the first
importance]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and only after you have enough food
can you form a government stable enough]{.underline}]{.mark} to deliver
water, health care, education, opportunity for women, justice, and
economic development. By neglecting or reducing support for basic food
production- as many have during the past twenty-five years-in order to
spread aid across these equally deserving causes, the world\'s aid
donors may unintentionally have laid the foundation for future
government failure and conflict. \"The absolute number of countries with
food crises caused by war and conflicts has increased since the 1985 as
has the relative share of food crises caused by socio-economic factors
from about 2 percent to 2.7 percent by 2.007,\" the UN\'s Food and
[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}griculture Organization in- formed the Committee
on World Food Security in 2008. \"The recent [[sharp increase in the
price of]{.underline}]{.mark} imported [[food]{.underline}]{.mark}
commodities [[is a]{.underline}]{.mark}n example of a socio-economic
[[shock that can]{.underline}]{.mark} exacerbate or [[cause food crises
in many countries]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"\" In describing the triggers
for today\'s conflicts, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency states in
its online World Fact Book, \"Territorial disputes may evolve from
historical and/or cultural claims, or they may be brought on by resource
competition. . . . \[S\]ources of contention include access to water and
mineral (especially hydrocarbon) resources, fish- eries, and arable
land.\" It adds, \"Armed conflict prevails not so much between the
uniformed armed forces of independent states as between stateless armed
entities that detract from the sustenance and welfare of local
populations, leaving the community of nations to cope with re- sultant
refugees, hunger, disease, impoverishment, and environmental
degradation.\" \'4 The CIA presumably has a good grasp of what makes
people fight. In its quest to predict where the world\'s next trouble
spots are likely to erupt, it clearly recognizes-on the public
record-the power of disputes over food, land, and water to fire the
tinder. A scan of the scores of cur- rent disputes it lists soon reveals
the frequent appearance of these three casus belli and of the border
confrontations triggered by them. The question is why many of the
world\'s governments appear unresponsive to the need to deal with these
triggers for war, if these are the warnings their intelligence services
are providing. The threat of [[conflict over
food]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} land, and water [[is
not]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[confined to the marginal
world]{.underline}]{.mark}. Increasingly it
[[imperils]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[economic powerhouses of the global
economy]{.underline}]{.mark} in the early twenty-first century. In 2001
the Australian strategic analyst Alan Dupont predicted, "Food is
destined to have greater strategic weight and import [in an era of
environmental scarcity]{.underline}. While optimists maintain that the
world is perfectly capable of meeting the anticipated increases in
demand for essential foodstuffs, there are enough imponderables to
suggest that prudent governments would not want to rely on such a
felicitous outcome.\" Anticipating the food crisis of 2007-8 by several
years, he presciently added, \"East Asia\'s rising demand for food and
diminishing capacity to feed itself adds an unpredictable new element to
the global food equation for several reasons. The gap between production
and consumption of key foodstuffs globally is narrowing dangerously and
needs to be reversed.\" Bearing out his words, Singapore president Lee
Hsieng Loong told a 2008 international defense conference, \"In the
longer term, the trends towards tighter supplies and higher prices will
likely reassert themselves. This has serious security implications. The
impact of a chronic food shortage will be felt especially by the poor
countries. The [[stresses]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[from]{.underline}]{.mark} hunger and [[famine]{.underline}]{.mark} can
easily [[result in social upheaval]{.mark}]{.underline} and civil
strife, [[exacerbating conditions that lead to **failed
states**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Between countries, [[competition for food
supplies and displacement of people]{.underline}]{.mark} across borders
[[could deepen tensions and provoke conflict and
wars]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"15 Indeed, the U.S. academics Ellen Messer
and Marc Cohen argue that [most modern conflicts ought to be viewed as
\"food wars,\"]{.underline} that is, \"the practice of warring parties
fighting for control of food supplies to re- ward their supporters and
punish their enemies.\" In 2003 they estimated that there were fifty-six
million people living in twenty-seven countries where food wars were
taking place.\" Aid agencies understood this better than anyone else.
When the 2007-8 food price crisis struck, the International Red Cross
(IRC) immediately warned of the risk of a surge in violence. Jakob
Kellenberger, the president of the IRC\'s International Committee, told

Strategy Is Essential to Our National Security," 5/1/17,

[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [faces]{.mark} many
**[threats]{.mark}** to our National Security. These threats include
continuing wars with extremist elements such as [**ISIS**]{.mark} and
potential wars with rogue state]{.underline} North Korea [[or]{.mark}
regional nuclear power **[Iran.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [The heated
economic and diplomatic [competition with **Russia** and]{.mark} a
surging [**China** could spiral out of control.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Concurrently, we face threats to our future security posed by growing
civil strife, famine, and refugee and migration challenges which create
incubators for extremist and anti-American government factions. Our
response cannot be one dimensional but instead must be a nuanced and
comprehensive National Security Strategy combining all elements of
National Power including a Food Security Strategy. [An **American Food
Security Strategy** is an imperative factor in **reducing the multiple
threats impacting our National wellbeing.**]{.underline} [Recent history
has shown that **[reliable food supplies and stable prices
produce]{.mark} more [stable]{.mark} and secure [countries.]{.mark}**
Conversely, food insecurity, particularly in poorer countries, can lead
to instability, unrest, and violence. [**Food insecurity** drives mass
migration]{.mark} around the world from the Middle East, to Africa, to
Southeast Asia, destabilizing neighboring populations, **[generating
conflicts]{.mark}**, and threatening our own security by disrupting our
economic, military, and diplomatic relationships.]{.underline} [**Food
system shocks** from extreme food-price volatility can be correlated
with protests and riots.]{.underline} Food price related protests
toppled governments in Haiti and Madagascar in 2007 and 2008. In 2010
and in 2011, food prices and grievances related to food policy were one
of the major drivers of the Arab Spring uprisings. Repeatedly, history
has taught us that a strong agricultural sector is an unquestionable
requirement for inclusive and sustainable growth, broad-based
development progress, and long-term stability. The impact can be
remarkable and far reaching. [Rising income, in addition to reducing the
opportunities for an upsurge in extremism, leads to changes in diet,
producing demand for more diverse and nutritious foods provided, in many
cases, from **American farmers** and ranchers.]{.underline} [**[Emerging
markets]{.mark}** currently [purchase 20 percent of U.S.
ag]{.mark}riculture [exports and that]{.mark} figure [is **expected to
grow**]{.mark} as populations boom.]{.underline} Moving early to ensure
stability in strategically significant regions requires long term
planning and a disciplined, thoughtful strategy. To combat current
threats and work to prevent future ones, our national leadership must
employ the entire spectrum of our power including diplomatic, economic,
and cultural elements. The best means to prevent future chaos and the
resulting instability is positive engagement addressing the causes of
instability before it occurs. This is not rocket science. We know where
the instability is most likely to occur. The world population will grow
by 2.5 billion people by 2050. Unfortunately, this massive population
boom is projected to occur primarily in the most fragile and food
insecure countries. This alarming math is not just about total numbers.
Projections show that the greatest increase is in the age groups most
vulnerable to extremism. There are currently 200 million people in
Africa between the ages of 15 and 24, with that number expected to
double in the next 30 years. Already, 60% of the unemployed in Africa
are young people. Too often **[[these]{.mark} situations [deteriorate
into shooting wars]{.mark}]{.underline}** requiring the deployment of
our military forces. We should be continually mindful that the price we
pay for committing military forces is measured in our most precious
national resource, the blood of those who serve. For those who live in
rural America, this has a disproportionate impact. Fully 40% of those
who serve in our military come from the farms, ranches, and non-urban
communities that make up only 16% of our population. Actions taken now
to increase agricultural sector jobs can provide economic opportunity
and stability for those unemployed youths while helping to feed people.
A recent report by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs identifies
agriculture development as the core essential for providing greater food
security, economic growth, and population well-being. [Our active
support for food security, including agriculture development, has helped
stabilize key regions over the past 60 years. A robust food security
strategy, as a part of our overall security strategy, can mitigate the
growth of terrorism, build important relationships, and support
continued American economic and agricultural prosperity while materially
contributing to our Nation's and the world's security.]{.underline}

5\. [[Food security as a catalyst of conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}

When discussing [the links between [failing food security]{.mark} and
[conflict]{.mark}, it may be useful to [focus]{.mark} attention [on
regions]{.mark} of the world [that are more vulnerable]{.mark} to food
insecurity than others and where food insecurity has been claimed to be
a catalyst of conflict. [These include the Middle East and North
Africa]{.mark} (MENA)]{.underline} and the Sahel as well as the Horn of
Africa. In 2011, several MENA countries were seriously affected by
conflict and remain so in 2013. Most of them are also affected by
failing food security. Six of the nine Sahelian countries are currently
involved in armed conflicts, and undernourishment and food security have
been implicated as either a cause or a consequence of several of them.
This applies as well to Somalia on the Horn.

5.1 [[The Arab Spring]{.underline}]{.mark}

The MENA region has been experiencing deteriorating parameters for both
food production and consumption for some time. Agricultural output is
constrained by limited water resources, diminishing arable land, and
poor public policy. Consumption is driven by high population growth,
urbanization and subsidies. A serious problem facing the region,
particularly the non-oil states, is the matter of affordable food. About
a fifth of the region lives under USD 2 a day.54

Egypt saw an increase in the prevalence of food insecurity to 17.2
percent (13.7 million people) in 2011 from 14 percent of the population
in 2009. The increase was driven largely by rising poverty rates and a
succession of crises from 2005, including the avian influenza epidemic
in 2006, the food, fuel and financial crises of 2007-09, further global
food price increases from late 2010 and a challenging macroeconomic
context in the wake of the 2011 revolution. As a result, twice as many
households were pushed into food insecurity than those moving out of it
in 2011. While the highest poverty rates remain in rural Upper Egypt,
significant pockets of poverty and food insecurity are emerging in urban
areas, where poverty increased by nearly 40 percent between 2009 and
2011, which means that Greater Cairo had 3.8 million poor people in
2011.55

When food prices increase, the impact on household spending is enormous,
and its effect is magnified politically and socially in two ways. The
first is that higher prices are felt disproportionately by the urban
population, which may enjoy higher incomes than the rural poor but do
not share the extra income growers receive from rising food prices. The
second is the less severe, but politically more critical, vulnerability
of the MENA region's middle class which is more sensitive to changes in
food prices than their rich-economy peers.

Food subsidies have been an important element of the MENA economies
since the 1950s. In 2010, Egypt spent about USD 3 billion on bread
subsidies. Larbi Sadiki sees the subsidies as the heart of a social
contract, "the democracy of bread", between the regimes and their
citizens to ensure peace and stability.56 Food, or more specifically its
price, has played a recurring role in the domestic politics of the
region. Since the 1970s, [[food inflation]{.mark}]{.underline} and/or
reductions in subsidies [[prompted violent protests in]{.mark} Egypt in
1977, Morocco in 1981, Tunisia in 1984, Jordan in 1996, and [across the
Middle East in 2008]{.mark}]{.underline}. The latter was in response to
the rapid acceleration of food prices on the eve of the global financial
crisis.

[At the end of 2010 and the start of 2011[, as protests erupted
first]{.mark} in Tunisia and then in Algeria, Yemen, Bahrain, Jordan,
and Egypt, [the price of food was]{.mark} widely [seen as a]{.mark}
significant, if not [principal, factor in the prompting the
unrest]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Food Price Index had been rising since
the beginning of 2009, and by the time it peaked in February 2011, the
index had registered a 68.3 percent increase. The Cereals Price Index
rose an even sharper 75.5 percent in a shorter period of time, from a
low in June 2010 to a high in April 2011.57

The result of rising food prices, along with other socio-economic
factors, such as high levels of unemployment, especially amongst
educated youth, was a steady increase in the cost of living and an
erosion of living standards. [Sharp [rises in]{.mark} domestic food
[prices]{.mark} from 2007 onwards [contributed to an unravelling of the
social contract]{.mark}]{.underline} whereby the regimes offered cheap
subsidized food, housing, utilities and fuel, often along with
employment in a bloated public sector in exchange for political loyalty.

Governments across the region--including those that were not immediately
threatened by protests-- sought to alleviate pressure by the customary
method of increasing subsidies and raising public sector salaries and
pensions. The measures suggested that those in power believed that
stated political grievances either masked underlying economic problems
or at least could be assuaged by addressing those problems. However,
subsidies provide only partial protection because they do not cover all
foods and even in categories where they do, their impact is mitigated by
corruption and black market sales.

[[A review of the relationship between]{.mark} food [security]{.mark}
problems [and]{.mark} social [unrest]{.mark} in the Middle East and
North Africa 58 [concludes that]{.mark} 'the [price]{.mark} of food
[was]{.mark} widely seen as [a]{.mark} significant, if not
[principal]{.mark}, [factor]{.mark} in prompting the unrest' and 'rising
food prices played a role in fomenting Arab Spring]{.underline} unrest
but appear to have been quickly overtaken by other grievances'. In the
run-up to the uprisings, both living standards and food security
deteriorated, but a wide array of factors precipitated the Arab Spring.
It is true that food prices rose fairly rapidly in Egypt, but Algeria
and Jordan also experienced rising prices while containing political
unrest. Tunisia, with smaller changes in food prices, was the first
country to erupt. In Egypt, though, food played an important symbolic
role as 'Tahrir Square in Cairo became the epicenter for people's
demands for bread, dignity and justice'.59

5.3 Causal chains

[[Is food security a cause of conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}? Based on a
review of recent research, the answer by Brinkman and Hendrix is a
qualified [[yes]{.underline}]{.mark}: '[Food [insecurity]{.mark},
especially when [caused by higher]{.mark} food [prices]{.mark},
[heightens the risk of **democratic breakdown, civil conflict, protest,
rioting, and communal conflict'**]{.mark}.65]{.underline}

[[Conflicts come in many forms]{.mark}.]{.underline} Hendrix and
Brinkman makes a distinction between ([a) [civil conflict between the
state and an opposition]{.mark} group; (b) [communal conflict
between]{.mark} two or more [distinct communities]{.mark} that neither
targets nor directly involves the state; and (c) [urban
unrest]{.mark}.66]{.underline}

They argue that food insecurity may motivate participation in armed
civil conflict at the individual level, but acute food insecurity may
also diminish conflict because it diminishes the resources available to
militants; it can hinder active political participation; and food denial
is often part of counterinsurgency operations. The causal link,
therefore, between food insecurity and civil conflict is both complex
and ambiguous, while the reciprocal relationship (civil conflict causing
food insecurity) is well established.

Communal conflicts tend to cluster in areas where land and water are
scarce, such as the regions of the Sahel. Recurrent droughts have
undermined cooperative relationships between pastoralists and sedentary
farmers, as pastoralist encroachments on farmlands have increased, like
in Sudan. Because herding activities occur in marginal lands, these
conflicts often take place against a backdrop of chronic or frequent
food insecurity and are exacerbated by poverty and political exclusion.
However, some studies have found that communal conflict is more
prevalent during times of both relative food security and abundance.67

[[Urban]{.mark} protests and [riots]{.mark} have [attracted]{.mark}
particular [attention after the food crisis]{.mark} and [during the Arab
Spring]{.mark}. A study from 2011 shows that violent and mostly urban
protest (of varying degrees of intensity) took place in 14 out of 53
African countries68 in connection with the 2007/08 food
crisis.]{.underline} The analysis tentatively concludes that food riots
are more likely to occur in authoritarian states with few political
freedoms and a high incidence of economic and human poverty. Low rates
of urbanization reduce the likelihood of food protest, however, as does
the presence of social protection programs. These rather general
conclusions are also supported in a global review carried out by
Christopher Barrett 69 in 2012, which only goes as far as stating that
'food security worries can spark public protest when mixed with a sense
of broader injustices'.

### ag turns structural violence

#### Food crisis supercharges structural violence -- it disproportionately affects those in poverty.

[Nearly [one billion people]{.mark} in the world [are]{.mark} now
[hungry]{.mark}]{.underline} (Chart); an additional 115 million people
are suffering from hunger [[as a result of]{.mark}]{.underline} the
combined impacts of [[rising food prices]{.underline}]{.mark} and the
global economic recession. Two recent prices spikes have shown the
limitations of the global food provisioning system. [[In]{.mark}
2007--[2008]{.mark}, [commodity prices doubled]{.mark}, and the
estimated number of hungry people topped one billion, while [food riots
spread through the developing world]{.mark}.]{.underline} In 2010--2011,
food prices increased again by 21 per cent.

The absolute number of undernourished people in the world has been on an
upward trend since the mid-nineties. While the proportion of
undernourished people has been more or less constant, it has risen
sharply owing to the food and financial crises. In 2009, undernourished
people accounted for 18 per cent of the world population.

Further, [the 2007--2009 [crisis has]{.mark} had [a different impact on
developed and developing countries, **with the least developed**]{.mark}
**countries [being affected the most]{.mark}**. Around [98 per cent
of]{.mark} the world's [undernourished people live in developing
countries]{.mark}]{.underline} According to the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations, two thirds of the undernourished
live in seven developing countries: Bangladesh, China, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia and Pakistan. The
prevalence of undernourishment varies significantly from region to
region, with sub-Saharan Africa heading the list with around 30 per cent
of the population, followed by Asia with 16 per cent and Latin America
and the Caribbean with 10 per cent.

In the developed world, most people were able to deal with the crisis
reasonably well as a result of well-functioning safety nets; however,
[[people in]{.mark} many relatively [poor]{.mark} import-dependent
[countries, especially in Africa, experienced]{.mark} large [price
hikes]{.mark} [that had permanent effects on]{.mark} their future income
and [their ability to escape poverty]{.mark}. Small farmers and [poor
consumers are extremely vulnerable to poverty]{.mark} as a result of
unstable commodity prices.]{.underline} It is important to note that
food represents a large share of farmer income and also a significant
share of the budget of low-income consumers. As a result, [big [changes
in food prices have a **large negative impact** on]{.mark} the real
incomes of small landholders and [poor families]{.mark}. For that
reason, even temporary reductions in prices for farmers or [price
hikes]{.mark} in prices for consumers [can cause]{.mark} permanent
effects on income, leading to [poverty traps]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Food prices have increased at an annual average rate of 12 per cent
since 2002, despite the trend shift during 2009. Prices for rice, wheat
and maize, traditional food staples, rose substantially during the
global economic crisis (Chart). Further, climate change, leading to
increasingly frequent natural disasters, the growing connections between
energy and food markets as a result of the rising demand for biofuels,
and the increased financialization of food and agricultural commodities
seem to indicate that price volatility will remain an important problem
in the near future. In addition, the fundamental causes of relatively
high prices seem to persist; in particular, consumer demand in rapidly
growing economies will increase, and the population continues to grow.
On the supply side, challenges must be met to deal with the increasingly
scarce natural resources in some regions, as well as declining rates of
yield growth for some commodities.

In addition to high and volatile food prices, [some countries are more
vulnerable than others to undernourishment and recurrent food shortages.
People in countries that are in protracted crises are more vulnerable to
hunger.]{.underline} According to FAO, [protracted crisis situations are
characterized by recurrent natural disasters and/or social conflict, the
longevity of food crises, the breakdown of livelihoods and insufficient
institutional capacity to react to the crises.]{.underline} One way FAO
identifies countries in protracted crises is by the proportion of
humanitarian assistance received by the country as a share of total ODA
. If a country has received 10 per cent or more of their ODA as
humanitarian aid since 2000, then it is classified as being in a
protracted crisis. Somalia, for example, one the 22 countries on FAO's
list of countries in protracted crisis has received as much as two
thirds of its ODA as humanitarian aid.

Summary

[When [international food prices were soaring]{.mark} in early
2008,]{.underline} there was a rush of publications predicting the
impact of such price hikes on poor people and suggesting policy
solutions. What hard evidence has been collected about the impact on
poor and vulnerable people in developing countries? Does this support or
change previous policy recommendations? This review draws together
evidence from studies on the effects of the 2007--08 price spike, as
well as from some other economic crises that resulted in high food
prices.

As predicted, [[high food prices increased malnutrition]{.mark}
(especially in young children) and poverty[. Some findings were]{.mark}
less obvious. These included: the depth of the impact in rural areas,
the [increase in inequality]{.mark}; the widespread use of credit to buy
food, [and the fact that most poverty impact came from increasing depth
of poverty in the already‐poor]{.mark}, rather than increased 'poverty
headcount'.]{.underline}

[[Who was worst‐affected]{.mark}?]{.underline}

As widely expected, [[poor]{.mark} net food importing
[countries]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g. island nations such as Haiti, rice
importing areas of West Africa, and countries in conflict)
[[were]{.mark} among the [first to feel the effects]{.mark} of rising
world food prices]{.underline}, and international assistance focused
initially on these. However, [[high]{.mark} food [prices were]{.mark}
also recorded as [having **a serious impact** on poor consumers]{.mark}
in net food exporting areas]{.underline} such as Thailand, Uganda and
northern Mozambique. The highest price rises were recorded from
countries where there were exacerbating local or regional supply and
demand pressures; these included conflict, drought or in a few cases,
for example Benin, rapid regional economic growth leading to rising
consumer demand.

[[The poorest households]{.mark} --- including many female‐headed
households and those with a large proportion of dependents --- **[were
worst hit everywhere]{.mark}**.]{.underline} These households spend a
higher proportion of their income on food and have less access to credit
and savings. [[The main impact of rising]{.mark} food [prices
was]{.mark} therefore from [**increasing depth of poverty** in those
already poor]{.mark} (the so‐ called poverty gap)]{.underline} rather
than the numbers of people newly pushed over the poverty line (the
poverty headcount).

[[The worst]{.mark}‐[affected]{.mark} groups [were]{.mark} casual wage
[labourers]{.mark} (both rural and urban), land‐[poor farmers]{.mark},
petty traders, [and producers of commodities]{.mark}]{.underline} whose
terms of trade declined against food grains: for example pastoralists in
Kenya, cotton farmers in Benin and tea workers in Bangladesh. Salaried
workers in the formal sector generally fared better than others.

While most of the high‐[profile [protests about]{.mark} food [prices
came]{.mark} from urban areas, many of [the poorest and
worst]{.mark}‐[affected]{.mark} people [live in rural
areas]{.mark}]{.underline}. Existing social protection and financial
systems often do not reach this group. The structure of land ownership
and production patterns in most poor countries meant that only a
minority of farmers and agribusinesses were able to benefit from
rapidly‐rising prices.

Inequality is likely to have increased, although quantitative data is
thin. One model estimated an increase in a country's Gini (inequality)
index of 1% for a 20% nominal food price rise, while actual price rises
were often four times this level. Within countries, regional inequality
is also likely to have increased, with marginal and dry agricultural
areas coming off worst. The regressive effect of rising food prices
contrasts with studies on rising fuel prices and the global financial
crisis, which have generally found that urban and richer areas are the
worst hit in the short term.

[[Children]{.mark} appear to **[have suffered
most]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Studies from Bangladesh, Cambodia and
Mauritania reported increases to the order of 50% in levels of acute
malnutrition of poor under‐fives, with plausible links to rising food
prices. In some areas, [[children]{.mark} also [lost]{.mark} out on
[education]{.mark}: a few studies reported very high (\> 50%) school
drop‐out rates of children from the poorest households, and many school
drop‐outs never return.]{.underline}

Data on gender impacts, in contrast, was very limited, and it was not
possible to confirm predictions that women would shoulder most of the
burden of high food prices. The exception was Bangladesh, where [several
studies reported greater weight losses and school absences in young
girls than boys]{.underline}. In surprising contrast to previous crises,
no studies were located which reported significant weight loss in adult
women.

### pharma turns nuclear war

#### Disease causes nuclear war

Biological Threats and Responses.\" International Security Vol. 34, No.

[[Pandemics]{.mark} are disease outbreaks that occur over a wide
geographic area, such as a region, continent, or the entire world, and
infect an unusually high proportion of the population. Two pandemic
diseases are widely cited as having the potential to [pose **direct
threats** to]{.mark} the **[stability]{.mark}** and security of
states]{.underline}: HIV/AIDS and influenza. HIV/AIDS. Since it was
first identified in 1981, HIV is estimated to have killed more than 25
million people worldwide. According to the Joint UN Program on HIV/AIDS
(UNAIDS), the percentage of the global population with HIV has
stabilized since 2000, but the overall number of people living with HIV
(33 million in 2007) has steadily increased. Sub-Saharan Africa
continues to bear a disproportionate share of the global burden of HIV
with 35 percent of new HIV infections, 75 percent of AIDS deaths, and 67
percent of all people living with HIV. 116 Scholars have identified four
ways that HIV/AIDS can affect security. 117 First, the
disproportionately high prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the armed forces of
some nations, particularly in Southern Africa, may compromise the
ability of those states to defend themselves from internal or external
threats. Militaries with high rates of HIV infection may suffer losses
in combat readiness and effectiveness as infected troops are transferred
out of combat roles, units lose cohesion because of high turnover rates,
middle management is \"hollowed out\" by the early death or disability
of officers, and defense budgets are strained because of rising medical
costs and the need to recruit and train replacements for sick soldiers.
The second threat is that HIV/AIDS [will [undermine]{.mark} the
**[international peace-keeping]{.mark}** system. Nations with
militaries]{.underline} with high rates of HIV/AIDS will be [unable to
provide **troops** for international peacekeeping missions; nations with
healthy militaries may be unwilling to commit troops to peacekeeping
operations]{.underline} in nations with a high prevalence rate of
HIV/AIDS; [and war-torn nations may be unwilling to accept peacekeepers
for fear they will spread the disease in their country.]{.underline} The
third threat is that a \"second wave\" of HIV/AIDS could
[[strike]{.mark} large, strategically important countries such as
[China, India, and Russia]{.mark}. These states, [which possess
**nuclear weapons** and]{.mark} are important players in critical
regions, also [suffer]{.mark} from [internal security challenges]{.mark}
that could be [aggravated by a]{.mark}]{.underline} severe AIDS
[[epidemic]{.underline}]{.mark} and its [attendant socioeconomic
disruptions]{.underline}. The fourth threat is that the high prevalence
of HIV in less developed countries will cause [[political
instability]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[could degenerate into **internal
conflict**]{.mark} or spread into neighboring countries]{.underline}.
Unlike most diseases, which affect primarily the poor, young, and old,
HIV/AIDS strikes young adults and members of the middle and upper

[[Regardless of where a pandemic starts]{.underline},]{.mark} once
underway, [[the poor]{.mark} tend to [bear the brunt.
Low]{.mark}]{.underline}- and middle-[[income
countries]{.underline}]{.mark} (LMICs) [[have weaker health systems
and]{.mark} limited [capacity to handle]{.mark} surges in
cases]{.underline}. Christopher Murray and colleagues estimate that [[if
a flu pandemic]{.mark} similar in severity to the 1918 Spanish flu
pandemic [were to hit]{.mark} today, [there could be 62 million
deaths]{.mark}, of which [96 percent would be in
LMICs]{.mark}]{.underline}.

We can curtail pandemics if we quickly develop vaccines and make them
widely accessible. However, without vigorous efforts to secure equitable
access, vaccine distribution will follow the logic of the market. During
the 2009 swine flu pandemic, wealthy countries secured large advance
orders for vaccines, but, despite the efforts of the World Health
Organization to negotiate donations, poor countries were crowded
out---receiving vaccines more slowly than rich countries and unable to
cover as many of their citizens.

These same [[distributional inequalities]{.mark} are also likely to
[play out within poor countries. The poorest regions]{.mark} in a
country [are]{.mark} often [the most vulnerable]{.mark} since they have
fewer pandemic response resources---fewer health workers and clinics and
less medicine. When outbreaks begin, [the poor]{.mark} are also more
likely to [have already been suffering from malnutrition and
immunosuppressive conditions]{.mark}, which can increase susceptibility
to infectious diseases.]{.underline}

[[A global pandemic]{.mark} that lasted a year [could trigger a "major

Bank.]{.underline} If a pandemic were on the scale of the Hong Kong flu
of 1968-69 in its transmissibility and severity, a yearlong outbreak
could cause world GDP to fall 0.7 percent. If we get hit with something
like the 1957 Asian flu, say goodbye to 2 percent of GDP. [[Something as
bad as the 1918-19 Spanish flu would cut the world's economic output by
4.8 percent and cost more than \$3 trillion]{.underline}]{.mark}.
"Generally speaking," the report added, "[[developing countries would be
hardest hit]{.mark}, because higher population densities and poverty
accentuate the economic impacts."]{.underline}

[[The majority of the economic losses]{.mark} would [come]{.mark} not
from sickness or death but [from]{.mark} what the World Bank calls
"[efforts to avoid infection]{.mark}: reducing air travel ... avoiding
travel to infected destinations, and reducing consumption of services
such as restaurant dining, tourism, mass transport, and nonessential
retail shopping."]{.underline}

The really bad news is that [we may not be hearing all the bad news.
[Economists]{.mark} who study pandemics [worry they may be
underestimating the financial toll]{.mark} because they haven't been
considering all the ramifications]{.underline}. "Research to understand
the indirect costs of an epidemic has been growing, focusing on how to
accurately incorporate productivity losses and effects on economic
activity," says Bruce Lee of the University of Pittsburgh Medical

**Klare 9** -- Prof of Peace and Security Studies (Michael T. Author and
Professor of Peace and World-Security Studies at Hampshire College,
March 19, 2009 "The Second Shockwave"
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-t-klare/the-second-shockwave_b_176358.html)>

While the [[economic contraction]{.underline}]{.mark} is apparently
slowing in the advanced industrial countries and may reach bottom in the
not-too-distant future, it\'s only beginning to gain momentum in the
developing world, which was spared the earliest effects of the global
meltdown. Because the crisis was largely precipitated by a collapse of
the housing market in the United States and the resulting disintegration
of financial products derived from the \"securitization\" of
questionable mortgages, most developing nations were unaffected by the
early stages of the meltdown, for the simple reason that they possessed
few such assets. But now, as the wealthier nations cease investing in
the developing world or acquiring its exports, the crisis is hitting
them with a vengeance. On top of this, conditions are deteriorating at a
time when severe drought is affecting many key food-producing regions
and poor farmers lack the wherewithal to buy seeds, fertilizers, and
fuel. The [[likely result]{.underline}]{.mark}: A looming [[food crisis
in]{.underline}]{.mark} many [[areas hit hardest]{.underline}]{.mark} by
the global economic meltdown. Until now, concern over [[the human
impact]{.underline}]{.mark} of the global crisis
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} largely [[been]{.underline}]{.mark} focused
\-- understandably so \-- on [[unemployment and]{.mark}]{.underline}
economic [[hardship]{.underline}]{.mark} in the United States, Europe,
and former Soviet Union. Many stories have appeared on the devastating
impact of plant closings, bankruptcies, and home foreclosures on
families and communities in these parts of the world. Much less coverage
has been devoted to the meltdown\'s impact on people in the developing
world. As the crisis spreads to the poorer countries, however, it\'s
likely that people in these areas will experience hardships every bit as
severe as those in the wealthier countries \-- and, in many cases, far
worse. The greatest worry is that most of [[the
gains]{.underline}]{.mark} achieved [[in eradicating
poverty]{.underline}]{.mark} over the last decade or so [[will be wiped
out, forcing]{.underline}]{.mark} tens or [[hundreds of
millions]{.underline}]{.mark} of people from the working class and the
lower rungs of the middle class back [[into]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[penury]{.underline}]{.mark} from which they escaped. Equally worrisome
is the risk of food scarcity in these areas, [[resulting in **widespread
malnutrition, hunger, and starvation**]{.underline}. [All this is sure
to produce **vast human misery**]{.underline}, [sickness, and
death]{.underline}]{.mark}, but [[could also result in social and
political unrest of various sorts, including riot, rebellion, and ethnic
strife]{.underline}]{.mark}. The president, Congress, or the mainstream
media are not, for the most part, discussing these perils. As before,
public interest remains focused on the ways in which the crisis is
affecting the United States and the other major industrial powers. But
the World Bank, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and U.S.
intelligence officials, in three recent reports, are paying increased
attention to the prospect of a second economic shockwave, this time
affecting the developing world.Sinking Back Into Penury In late
February, the World Bank staff prepared [a background
paper](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/NEWS/Resources/swimmingagainstthetide-march2009.pdf)
for the Group of 20 (G-20) finance ministers meeting held near London on
March 13 and 14. Entitled \"Swimming Against the Tide: How Developing
Countries Are Coping with the Global Crisis,\" it provides a preliminary
assessment of the meltdown\'s impact on low-income countries (LICs). The
picture, though still hazy, is one of deepening gloom. Most LICs were
shielded from the initial impact of the sudden blockage in private
capital flows because they have such limited access to such markets.
\"But while slower to emerge,\" the report notes, \"the impact of the
crisis on LICs has been no less significant as the effects have spread
through other channels.\" For example, \"many LIC governments rely on
disproportionately on revenue from commodity exports, the prices of
which have declined sharply along with global demand.\" Likewise,
foreign direct investment is falling, particularly in the natural
resource sectors. On top of this, remittances from immigrants in the
wealthier countries to their families back home have dropped, erasing an
important source of income to poor communities. Add all this up, and
it\'s likely that \"the [[slowdown]{.underline}]{.mark} in growth
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[deepen]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[deprivation of the existing poor]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" In many LICs,
moreover, \"[[large numbers]{.underline}]{.mark} of people are
[[clustered just above the poverty line and]{.mark}]{.underline} are
therefore [[particularly vulnerable to economic volatility and temporary
slowdowns]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" As the intensity of the crisis grows,
more and more of these [[people will lose]{.underline}]{.mark} their
[[jobs or]{.underline}]{.mark} their other [[sources of
income]{.underline}]{.mark} (such as those all-important remittances)
and so be pushed from *above* the poverty line to *beneath* it. The
resulting outcome: \"The [[economic crisis]{.underline}]{.mark} is
[[projected to increase poverty]{.underline}]{.mark} by around [[46
million]{.underline}]{.mark} people in 2009.\"

drama.

Opinions about NAFTA\'s replacement vary on both sides of the aisle, but
[[there\'s a growing consensus that it won\'t pass]{.mark} muster [in
Congress until the tariffs are lifted]{.mark}]{.underline} --- without
being replaced by any other managed-trade mechanisms, like import
quotas, said Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, the chair of the House Ways and
Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over international trade.

\"Key things in my discussions with members, [Republicans and Democrats,
is that they\'re not really willing to consider this agreement until the
steel and aluminum tariffs are ensured to be lifted off]{.underline},
including quotas,\" Brady said Tuesday during a morning appearance at a
trade conference in Washington.

\"Frankly, quotas can be just as disruptive as tariffs can be \... the

During last week's uncertainty over trade with Mexico, most
[[Democrats]{.mark} publicly]{.underline} separated USMCA deliberations
from Trump's tariff plan, which means that removing the tariff threat

[U.S]{.mark}.-[M]{.mark}exico-[C]{.mark}anada [A]{.mark}greement on
trade [until]{.mark} some [further changes are
made]{.mark}]{.underline}. They said that despite the White House,
Canada, and Mexico addressing several Democratic demands.

Sen. Ron [[Wyden]{.underline}]{.mark}, D-Ore[., the ranking Democrat on
the Senate Finance Committee]{.underline}, said in a letter to U.S.
Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer that he still [[had]{.mark}
serious [concerns about USMCA\'s mechanisms for resolving]{.mark}
investor-state [disputes]{.mark}.]{.underline} \"I have been open to
hearing arguments as to how it may actually work. So far, the
Administration's justification for this mechanism has only increased my
worry that the new Agreement will not be enforced,\" he said.

[Wyden [also reiterated concerns]{.mark} often expressed by Democrats
[regarding whether Mexico will live up to its obligations]{.mark} under
the trade deal [to reform its labor laws]{.mark}]{.underline}. Resolving
the dispute settlement problem could resolve this issue as well, he said
by \"shoring up the ability to bring labor cases under dispute
settlement.\"

Rep. Earl [[Blumenauer]{.underline}]{.mark}, D-Ore., who [chairs the
Ways and Means Committee\'s trade subcommittee]{.underline}, raised
similar objections during a hearing Wednesday. He [[said labor
enforcement]{.underline}]{.mark} [under the 1993 North America Free
Trade Agreement was extremely poor and therefore [must be addressed in
the USMCA]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is intended to to replace NAFTA.

\"In every case in which a labor complaint has been filed \[under
NAFTA\], there remain ongoing and serious concerns regarding compliance
with the labor obligations. In the only case in which the United States
has pursued dispute settlement --- the Guatemala labor case --- it took
nearly a decade to receive a final ruling, and the United States lost
the dispute,\" Blumenauer noted.

Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., said enforcement of trade deals is central
to their effectiveness: \"Without it, an agreement isn\'t worth the
paper it is printed on. Period. We know that we cannot continue with a
broken dispute settlement process that lingers like a fog from the first
NAFTA. Congress cannot and will not be fooled by false promises.\"

The [[Trump]{.mark} administration, Canada, and Mexico [have been
trying]{.mark} in recent weeks [to resolve issues]{.mark} lawmakers have
raised regarding USMCA.]{.underline} On Friday, the White House exempted
Canada and Mexico from tariffs on steel and aluminum. Canada and Mexico
responded in Monday by removing retaliatory the tariffs that they had
enacted last year. Many lawmakers had balked at holding a vote on USMCA
until the tariffs, which they argued were doing more harm than good to
the U.S. economy, had been lifted.

Mexico also amended its labor laws last month to bring them in line with
what Democrats have demanded as part of the USMCA deal.

[USMCA\'s [backers had hoped the changes would build momentum
towards]{.mark} the Democrat-led House holding [a vote]{.mark}.
But]{.underline} the [[Democratic leaders have balked]{.mark} at holding
one anytime soon]{.underline}.

Political Science 101 says that Donald Trump should be running on the
economy for 2020. Political Science 201 says matters are not that
simple. [[The stress of being an American under Trump is getting
worse.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[The economy is doing]{.mark} pretty [well]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Economic growth is a shade under 3 percent, unemployment is well below 4
percent, and inflation is below 2 percent. These are great top-line
numbers, thanks to the Trump administration's unwitting discovery of
Keynesianism.

[[These numbers do not tell the]{.mark} whole [story,
however.]{.mark}]{.underline} The New York Times' Jonathan Martin and
Maggie Haberman note that while voters give Trump decent marks on the
economy, there's a soft underbelly to those numbers: "most workers are
still gaining less under Mr. Trump than they did during previous times
of low unemployment, such as the late 1990s, and [[fewer than two in
five respondents]{.mark} to a SurveyMonkey poll for The New York Times
this month [said their family was better off]{.mark} financially today
than a year ago."]{.underline}

[[If the economy is doing well but]{.mark} average [Americans aren't
feeling it, that **is bad news for Trump**.]{.mark}]{.underline} And
looking beyond the economy, there is an awful lot of evidence suggesting
that Americans are not feeling too well. The polling data is one obvious
metric. According to Gallup, in 2018, more Americans were stressed,
worried and angry than at any point in the last 12 years. That is
extraordinary when you consider that the past dozen years includes the
2008 financial crisis and multiple terrorist attacks. Furthermore,
American stress levels are among the highest in the world[. Seriously,
[Americans were]{.mark} as stressed as Iranians and [more stressed than
citizens of Rwanda]{.mark}, Turkey, [and Venezuela]{.mark}. That's
nuts.]{.underline}

Does Trump have anything to do with this? It is difficult to determine
causality, but the data is pretty suggestive. [[Trump inspires]{.mark} a
whole host of [negative reactions in]{.mark} most
[Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}. Pew polled Americans in the spring and
asked them to describe how Trump's comments and statements made them
feel. The top seven responses, in order: concerned (76 percent),
confused (70 percent), embarrassed (69 percent), exhausted (67 percent),
angry (65 percent), insulted (62 percent) and frightened (56 percent). I
am not a psychologist, [but I would reckon that there might be something
going on here. If these are the dominant emotions that Trump elicits,
and if Trump is everywhere, then hey, it's going to stress a lot of
Americans out!]{.underline}

Even more concrete evidence has come to light in the past week[. As my
Post colleagues William Wan and Lindsey Bever reported recently,
"[Researchers have begun to identify correlations between
Trump]{.mark}'s election and worsening cardiovascular health, sleep
problems, anxiety [and stress]{.mark}, especially among Latinos in the
United States."]{.underline} One disturbing JAMA study looked at
premature births, an easily quantifiable metric of stress during
pregnancy. After analyzing approximately 33 million births between 2009
and 2017 researchers found 3 percent more preterm births than expected
among Latina women in the nine months after the election.

It's not just Latina women who are feeling the stress of America under
Trump. The Boston Globe's Zoe Greenberg reports that psychologists are
having to treat a number of anxiety-related maladies among minority
clients, including insomnia and hypervigilance. When they dig deeper,
the underlying cause becomes apparent:

As Trump doubles down on attacks against the four women of color in
Congress known as "The Squad," which includes Omar and Representative
Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, some people of color in the Boston
area describe a psychological toll that the episodes, and Trump's
frequent overt hostility, have had on their daily lives --- not just
this month, but in the many months since the 2016 presidential campaign
began.

Some have tried to guard themselves against the everyday tumult coming
from the White House; others have become more vocal in politics. Some
have found a grim silver lining, because the scourge of racism that some
white people recently claimed had disappeared is now impossible to
ignore or explain away. Many said it reminds them of other dark moments
of personal and national history, when racial hostility and tension
reared up\....

["We have now 20 years of research that connects racism with just about
every mental health issue that has been studied," said Monnica Williams,
a professor and the director of the laboratory for Culture and Mental
Health Disparities at the University of Connecticut]{.underline}. The
effect of "vicarious racism" --- seeing, for example, videos of police
shootings of unarmed black men, or hearing chants of "Send her back!"
--- has not been studied as much, according to Jessica Graham-LoPresti,
an assistant professor of psychology at Suffolk University, but social
media indicates the experience is certainly on the rise.

"People are being now not only exposed to their own experiences of
racism, but they're being vicariously exposed to everyone's experience
of racism," she said, adding that patients often exhibit symptoms very
similar to those from post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as
depression and social anxiety.

[There are a lot of drivers of stress. A robust economy should lessen a
primary driver. But the data is pretty clear. [The U.S. economy is not
benefiting]{.mark} as many [citizens]{.mark} as one would
expect.]{.underline} More significantly, Trump's racial divisiveness and
bellicose rhetoric are stressing out an awful lot of Americans.

There are multiple ways to help alleviate this national anxiety. More
social capital will be needed. More balanced economic growth would be
nice. It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that [the best
palliative care for U.S. stress levels will be to make sure Donald Trump
exits the White House as expeditiously as possible.]{.underline}

Accessed 07-24-2019) PRK

[President [Trump's quest to add a citizenship question]{.mark} to the
2020 census [ended]{.mark} Tuesday, [with the administration]{.mark}
caving on the plans, [bowing to a Supreme Court
ruling]{.mark}]{.underline} and an intractable time crunch.

[A Justice Department attorney,]{.underline} in an email that found its
way onto Twitter, [said the department had finalized the questionnaire
and given the green light to print it without the citizenship
question.]{.underline}

[[The decision is a **symbolic blow** to]{.mark} Mr. [Trump]{.mark},
[**who staked significant political capital** on]{.mark} his ability to
get [the question]{.mark} added and who had said it was "ridiculous" to
conduct a census without asking about citizenship.]{.underline}

As late as Monday, the president told reporters he was considering
ordering an unprecedented delay of the 2020 count to try to shoehorn the
question into the form.

But by Tuesday, the realities of the calendar and his administration's
own legal positioning had set in.

"We can confirm that the decision has been made to print the 2020
Decennial Census questionnaire without a citizenship question, and that
the printer has been instructed to begin the printing process," Kate
Bailey, one of the Justice Department attorneys involved in the case,
said in the email that found its way onto social media.

Adding the question was going to be a long shot after the Supreme Court,
led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., erected a roadblock last week.

The court ruled that while a citizenship question can be legal --- and
indeed has been asked on the full census before --- the Trump
administration cut too many corners by adding it this time.

The chief justice said he doubted the explanations of Commerce Secretary
Wilbur Ross for the need to add the question. He called it "contrived"
and ordered a do-over.

The only problem was that the administration told the court that it
faced a June 30 deadline --- Sunday --- for finalizing the questionnaire
and sending it to the printer.

Mr. Trump was faced with options of either arguing that the deadline
wasn't real or attempting to delay the census entirely, which would have
invited a whole new round of legal battles.

[[Democrats]{.underline}]{.mark}, who accused Mr. Trump of trying to
weaponize the census to suppress Hispanic and immigrant participation,
[[cheered the president's failure.]{.underline}]{.mark}

"A citizenship question would have pushed us backward for nothing more
than crass political calculations," said [Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., New
Jersey Democrat. "Today America won, and Donald [Trump and his political
minions lost]{.mark}."]{.underline}

#### Trump has little to no PC left 

**Progressive News Network**, article is citing an article by the

strong-arm Congress is actually a sign of his weakness -- Progress News

Suing a committee chairman and his own accounting firm. Telling people
who don't work for him anymore that they can't testify to Congress.
Having his personal lawyer tell the Treasury Department not to release
Trump's tax returns to Congress. These are all actions President Trump
has taken against Congress in the past few days, evidence that he's
going full-court to stop lawmakers from investigating him.

It's an unprecedentedly brazen move for a president. But Joshua Huder, a
fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University,
says it's actually a sign of Trump's weakness.

Past presidents have negotiated behind the scenes with Congress when
they don't want to turn over information. They've relied on influential
allies on Capitol Hill to help make their case. Trump is forced to take
the most extreme measures because he doesn't have enough soft power to
do that, Huder argues. As a result, Trump is forcing himself into
high-profile legal and political battles he has a real risk of losing.

"[T[he president lacks]{.underline}]{.mark} [a lot of informal modes of
[influence]{.mark}," Huder said, "[and]{.mark} he [can't
convince]{.mark} the [allies]{.mark} he does have]{.underline}."

\[The 6 most potentially damaging congressional investigations into
Trump, ranked\]

Trump's weakness has manifested itself in other ways that have cost him
politically.

**[[Trump spent nearly all]{.mark} [of his political capital]{.mark} at
the beginning of this year [trying to get Congress to fund a border
wall]{.mark} along the U.S.-Mexico border.]{.underline}** [[He
**failed** when]{.mark} enough [Republicans joined with Democrats to
pass a spending bill that didn't include the]{.mark} amount of [money he
wanted. The]{.mark} **[longest shutdown in]{.mark} federal government
[history failed to win over lawmakers to Trump's side]{.mark}**
---]{.underline} or any new money for his wall. (And let's not forget
that presidential candidate Donald Trump campaigned on Mexico paying for
the wall, another place where his negotiations seem to have fallen
through.)

To make good on his central campaign promise, Trump declared a national
emergency and took money from elsewhere to do it. The consequence? A
lengthy, time-consuming legal battle that could go all the way to the
Supreme Court.

"Look, I expect to be sued," he said in February when he announced the
emergency declaration. "We'll win in the Supreme Court."

[[Trump is likely to lose the]{.mark} many [legal fights he has picked
with Congress]{.mark} over that branch of government's right to see his
tax returns and financial statements and to issue subpoenas to his
former top aides]{.underline}. (Though to the extent this is all a delay
tactic to the 2020 presidential election, Trump may succeed.)

\[A reader's guide to all of Trump's fights with Congress\]

Still, the president is engaging in extremely risky legal battles just
as [[his support in Congress appears to be eroding]{.underline}]{.mark},
if ever so slightly.

[Trump recently wanted to try again to repeal Obamacare; Senate Majority
Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refused. Trump suddenly got rid of most
of his top immigration officials --- [top Senate Republicans]{.mark}
went on Fox News and [publicly warned him]{.mark} to stop. He wanted to
nominate Herman Cain to the Federal Reserve --- pushback from
Republicans had him drop the idea.]{.underline}

To some degree, Trump's strong-arming tactics with Congress reflect his
personality. Trump's M.O., long before getting into politics, has been
to threaten and intimidate to get his way.

"It's a Trumpian way of negotiating," Larry Kudlow, a Trump friend and
current White House economic adviser, once said. "You knock them in the
teeth and get their attention. And then you kind of work out a deal."

But Trump would probably prefer not to have to go to such extremes with
Congress right now. Instead of messaging ahead of the 2020 election,
he's forcing himself into high-profile legal battles that will keep
these politically dangerous stories in the news. All because, Huder
argues, he had no other choice.

#### Trump PC loss inevitable

\"2019 has been Trump's most disjunctive year yet. And it's only
February.,\" Vox,

(VIK)

A few weeks after the longest government shutdown in history, projected
to have cost \$3 billion in lost GDP, it looks as though we won't have
another one right away. Over the objections of leaders in his own party,
[[Trump]{.mark} has [announced that he will declare a national
emergency]{.mark} in order to construct a wall along the US southern
border. [Welcome to the politics of disjunction]{.mark}.]{.underline}

What does this mean? According to Stephen Skowronek's theory of
presidents and parties in cyclical "political time," disjunctive
presidents are the ones who go down in history as the worst. These
presidents have some commonalities across historical eras, but a few
things stand out: they come at the end of a "regime" started 40 to 60
years prior where a president of the same party set the terms of debate.
But those terms, and the coalition that united behind them, have gone
stale and no longer meet the demands of the era.

We can understand how [[disjunctive politics is shaping the Trump
administration]{.mark}, the shutdown, and even what's going on to some
extent on the Democratic side]{.underline}, by thinking about three
gaps.

The gap between Trump's base and the rest of the country

During the 35-day shutdown, a poll by Pew said that 29 percent of
Americans favored substantially expanding the border wall and found a
budget deal without wall funding an unacceptable option. This number is
a bit lower than what experts have estimated is Trump's public opinion
"floor," so it probably reflects his absolute core supporters who are
either diehard Republicans or simply devotees of the president and his
ideas (or both). What's more, this number is similar to the average
polls on support for a national emergency.

One way to look at this is to say, well, 30 percent is far from a
majority. The correct --- or at least most representative --- course of
action should be obvious. In the context of disjunctive politics, it
poses a trickier situation. [One of the key features of disjunction is
that [presidents in this position can't reconcile the imperatives of
their party with the broader national conversation]{.mark}.]{.underline}

For Franklin Pierce back in the 1850s, this was reconciling the fact
that the Democratic Party had built its political operation on balance
across regions and compromise over slavery. As the conflict over
expansion and the institution itself grew in intensity, the two
political logics couldn't coexist.

In the case of Herbert Hoover, the important ideas and players in the
Republican Party weren't compatible with making fundamental adjustments
in the political economy to address the Great Depression.

For [[Trump]{.mark}, it's a set of [ideas]{.mark} that provided the
justification for his presidential candidacy but [have proven to
be]{.mark} [out of step with the country overall.]{.mark}]{.underline}
It's not just a matter of ignoring public opinion, but of the
impossibility of bridging this particular gap. And the difference
doesn't seem to be shrinking: [Americans tend to favor more "welcoming"
immigration policies]{.underline}, in the words of Tufts University
political scientist Deborah Schildkraut.

The gap between politics and policy

When politics and policy are aligned, politicians can run on slogans and
ideas that garner political support for policies that are workable and
reasonably popular. No policy is seamless in its implementation or
unanimous in its reception. But sometimes leaders do manage to run on an
idea that can translate into a policy change that achieves some of what
it promises: new government programs, tax cuts, better health coverage,
etc.

The way this seems to have manifested in contemporary politics is in
debates that are long on symbolism and short on policy specifics. The
wall is a good example of this; experts suggest that it would make no
difference in stopping drugs or human trafficking, and his depiction of
a disaster in places like El Paso doesn't seem to resonate with either
immigration experts or residents.

Symbolism also plays a role for Democrats. The proposed Green New Deal
has drawn some criticism for being aspirational rather than a practical
plan (it's also been praised for the same thing). Being skilled at
messaging (especially, but maybe not only on Twitter) turns out to be
useful for politicians across the ideological spectrum, but it's still
an open question whether that helps change policy.

The long shutdown had a lot of negative effects, but it may have helped
narrow the gap between politics and policy. Republican legislators
clearly grew weary of paying the political costs of a prolonged
shutdown. Americans got to see all of the areas where government
performs an important function and policy matters: air travel, national
parks, weather forecasting.

The emergency declaration, on the other hand, once again widens the gap
between politics and policy, reinforcing a sense that rhetoric is
separate from either tangible problems or pragmatic solutions. A
Facebook meme has emerged where you can mark yourself "safe from Trump's
bullshit emergency."

We might be used to a politics in which we expect a lot of symbolism and
not a lot of concrete policy acton. But that doesn't make it okay. A
widening gap between politics and policy is a concerning development. In
a democracy, words have meaning. [[Trump]{.mark} has [declared an
emergency]{.mark}, [but even many members of Trump']{.mark}s own
[party]{.mark} [don't buy the emergency
characterization]{.mark}.]{.underline} A situation in which a president
calls something an emergency in order to go around Congress not only
undermines basic transparency and honesty, it also contributes to a
general cynicism about politics that is often a feature of a disjunctive
presidency.

The gap between Trump's formal and informal power

I noted in my piece about the lessons of 2018 that we should think about
Trump's presidency not purely in terms of weakness and strength.
Instead, we should consider the different kinds of formal and informal
power that individual presidents can wield. [[Trump]{.mark}
[lacked]{.mark} [the ability to make the border wall popular]{.mark},
[but his]{.mark} formal [capacities to veto bills]{.mark} informed
Congress' response to him anyway. [And]{.mark} despite the president's
[lack of any kind of formal control over his party]{.mark}, Mitch
McConnell's reaction to the shutdown illustrated that Trump is still in
meaningful ways the leader of the Republican Party.]{.underline}

[The emergency declaration has [made this gap even more
evident]{.mark}]{.underline}. The law allows Trump to declare an
emergency (at least until courts say otherwise or Congress passes a
joint resolution ending it). Nevertheless, **[[the president's]{.mark}
[political capital]{.mark}, informal authority, and influence, whatever
you want to call it, [is likely to fall as a result of the shaky
justification for invoking a state of emergency]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
In classic disjunctive form, Trump can do it, because the presidency is
powerful no matter where we are in the cycle. Defining and justifying it
will be a lot harder.

alcoholic beverages. At the same time, it would lead to a small increase
in U.S. imports of sugar and sugar-containing products and dairy
products from Canada.

Specifically, [[modeling results estimate]{.mark} a \$226.8 million
([0.1%) gain in total dairy product output]{.mark}]{.underline},
including \$314.5 million (7.1%) of additional exports \-- \$227.0
million to Canada and \$50.6 million to Mexico \-- over the baseline.
Increased exports to Canada would be driven largely by more exports of
cheese and other milk and cream products. New country-specific
tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) in Canada would create additional
opportunities for U.S. exports of milk and milk powder, cheese, butter
and other products.

USMCA would require Canada to establish a duty-free TRQ for live
chickens and chicken meat of U.S. origin. The TRQ volume in the first
year would be 47,000 metric tons. It would increase by 2,000 mt annually
through the sixth year of USMCA and then increase by 1% per year to
62,963 mt in year 16, remaining at that level in following years. Model
results indicate that U.S. poultry meat exports to Canada would increase
by \$183.5 million (or nearly 50%) in year 6 of the agreement.

Senate Finance Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), who will be
the one to shepherd approval of USMCA in the Senate, said he plans to
conduct a thorough and thoughtful review of this and other studies of
the economic impact of USMCA in the coming days. He also noted that he
will be briefed by ITC officials early in the week of April 22.

"Many of the significant improvements in USMCA are reducing non-tariff
barriers and implementing rules and fair practices that will help U.S.
workers, jobs and businesses tremendously over the coming years. The
USMCA makes critical updates to rules on intellectual property, currency
practices, digital trade, customs, state-owned enterprises, sanitary and
phytosanitary measures and technical barriers to trade that will be
valuable to many American farmers and businesses, even though their
impact on \[gross domestic product\] has historically been inherently
difficult for economists to measure," Grassley said.

In response to the report, [[many agricultural groups noted that]{.mark}
many of [the benefits under]{.mark} the North American Free Trade
Agreement ([NAFTA) have already been realized]{.mark} for the
agriculture industry]{.underline}.

"While the ITC report is an important step in the process of considering
trade agreements, [the benefits of North American trade are already well
understood, particularly by farmers and ranchers. Under NAFTA, [ag
exports]{.mark} to Canada and Mexico [grew from \$8 billion in 1993 to
\$40 billion last year]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}" according to
Brian Kuehl, co-executive director of Farmers for Free Trade, a
bipartisan coalition supported by American agricultural commodity
groups.

about \$70 million to that.

In exchange for this, the Trump administration dropped its insistence

prevailed in getting rid of another, having to do with disputes between
businesses and governments. Canadian businesses can no longer challenge
U.S. government policies and vice versa. That chapter survived with
regard to disputes between Mexico and the United States, but in a

### 2ac -- ag doesn't cause conflict

#### Food crisis is not caused by agricultural crisis -- political problems are the actual cause -- experts agree.

[[The U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations [announced]{.mark} this month
[that more than 20 million people]{.mark} in four countries [are]{.mark}
teetering [on the edge of famine]{.mark}, calling the situation "the
worst humanitarian crisis" since the end of World War II.]{.underline}

The key for avoiding the worst outcomes? Political will, experts say.

Modern famines are different from those the world faced 60 to 70 years
ago. In the past, with less warning and less international support, more
people died from hunger. In the early and mid-20th century, famines
killed millions in Europe and Asia, in areas with much larger
populations than areas which suffer from food insecurity today.

According to estimates from the World Peace Foundation, the deadliest
famine in recorded history actually did take place after World War II.
During China's Great Leap Forward, about 30 million people died from
hunger between 1958 and 1962.

What explains the UN\'s statement, then? They may be counting famines by
decade, which would have split the Great Leap Forward crisis between the
1950s and the 1960s:

These days, famines cause death by the thousands, and are mostly
confined to the Horn of Africa. Improvements in transportation and
communications infrastructure have been successful in eliminating
large-scale famines in virtually all other parts of the world.

But the current situations in Somalia, Yemen, Nigeria and South Sudan
are undeniably harsh.

"Those people will suffer, their children will be malnourished, they
will likely be displaced, lose their livelihoods, and some people will
no doubt die as a result of this crisis," says [Dan [Maxwell, a food
security professor]{.mark} and director of the Feinstein International
Center at Tufts University.]{.underline}

[Maxwell [exphasizes that modern-day famines **are rarely caused by a
lack of food**. "There has **never been a case that agricultural
production causes** famine alone," he says. "It]{.mark} only [causes a
famine if someone lets it]{.mark} cause a famine."]{.underline}

And that\'s where data become especially important. Measuring early
indicators is crucial for averting famine, as is early investment. In
its March announcement, the UN asked for \$4.4 billion in emergency
funding for intervention, and released \$22 million in an emergency loan
to Somalia on March 21.

"If we get to the point where a famine is declared, it's essentially
indicating a failure on the part of the international community,"
explains Chris Hillbruner of the Famine Early Warning Systems Network,
or FEWS NET.

So, how do we measure the warning signs?

FEWS NET uses the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)
5-point rating system, which rates areas around the world to signal how
serious food insecurity is there. The ratings go from \"minimal\" to
\"stressed, crisis, emergency and famine.\"

The scale, developed in 2006 and updated in 2012, is in use in 25
countries and gives a consistent measure for food insecurity.

"There should be a response at phase 3 and phase 4," Hillbruner said.
"Phase 4 is where people start dying because of food insecurity. If one
waits until famine and then starts responding, inevitably it will be too
late."

Watch severe food insecurity in Africa and Yemen develop from 2015
through FEWS NET projections into July 2017. Famine information for
Yemen is not yet available for February 2017 and 2017 projections.
(Source: FEWS NET)

To declare a famine, at least 20 percent of households surveyed in an
area must face lack of food, and more than 30 percent of children in an
area have to have a weight that is recorded as dangerously low. If you
don't have data that says that, you can't declare famine even if people
are starving.

The situation in Yemen is the largest food insecurity emergency in the
world right now, according to FEWS NET. Seven governorates there are
classified as phase 4. An estimated 17 million people, or 60 percent of
the population, are food insecure.

In South Sudan, about 4.9 million are estimated to be food insecure and
that number will climb to 5.5 million by July. Five counties are
classified at 4 and 5 and will worsen.

FEWS NET officials struggle to access parts of Nigeria, and reported in
December that a famine likely occurred in Bama and Banki towns and the
surrounding rural areas in 2016.

In Somalia, 400,000 people are in IPC phase 4 and face starvation; 5.2
million others are in phases 2 and 3. It is facing its third famine in
the past 25 years, including one in 2011 which left 260,000 people dead.

Hunger is a political issue

[[Maxwell says there's a]{.mark} common [misconception]{.mark} among the
public [that]{.mark} overpopulation and [lack of resources are
the]{.mark} main [drivers behind food insecurity]{.mark}. (It's a theory
that was put forth by Thomas Malthus nearly two centuries ago.) In other
words, [that people starve because there\'s not enough
food.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[But Emily [Farr, Emergency Food Security]{.mark} and Vulnerable
Livelihoods team [leader at Oxfam, says that\'s not the]{.mark}
underlying [problem. "We are talking about situations]{.mark} that are
[caused by human behavior]{.mark}," she says.]{.underline}

[The Horn of Africa region, where hunger is worst, is also prone to
drought --- but the [impacts of climate change]{.mark} alone [are not
enough to create famine]{.mark}, experts say, so long as they are
managed.]{.underline}

Farr emphasizes that fast-acting humanitarian response is important for
mitigating famines, although the data can be hard to come by.

"There have been cases in the past where we haven't been able to declare
food insecurity as much as it was because we simply didn't have the
data," Farr says.

Conflict especially can limit access. In South Sudan, for example,
violence has claimed the lives of at least 12 aid workers this year and
as many as 79 since 2013.

Innovations in technology, such as the World Food Program's Mobile
Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping project, which uses cellphones to
survey food security, can help fill in missing numbers. FEWS NET employs
high resolution satellite imagery to estimate crop production and
population displacement patterns.

[[Fundamentally, Hillbruner of FEWS NET describes famine as a]{.mark}
humanitarian and **[political issue]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

"I think there are times when it's overstated that there are places we
can't get any information," he said. "But when the political will is
there, everyone suddenly has access."

Clarification: This story has been updated to reflect the difference
between populations in famine (IPC stage 4) and those facing severe food
insecurity (IPC phases 2 and 3).

A high-level side event during the 73rd session of the United Nations

pressing [issue of conflict-based food insecurity]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"The use of hunger as a weapon of war is a war crime. Yet,
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} some [[conflict]{.mark} settings,

Action Against Hunger's CEO Veronique Andrieux]{.underline}

"Conflict-related hunger is one of the most visible manifestations to
human suffering emerging from war...this suffering is preventable and
thus all the more tragic," said United States' Agency for International
Development's (USAID) administrator Mark Green.

According to the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2018,
[[the number of hungry people increased]{.mark}]{.underline} to over 820
million in 2017 from approximately 804 million in 2016, levels unseen

Here we are again. [[Famine is]{.mark} back [in the
news]{.mark}.]{.underline} Following drought in Somalia, Ethiopia and
Kenya, the Disasters Emergency Committee has recently launched an appeal
for East Africa. We have been reminded that we have one last chance to
stop utter devastation in South Sudan. Across the continent more and
more horror reveals itself as areas are taken back from Boko Haram by
the Nigerian army. Outside Africa, across the Gulf of Aden, we have seen
the little bodies of children wasting away in Yemen.

I have written before that aid professionals like me have done a bad job
of explaining the reasons behind fragility and crisis -- that [we need
to be more honest about how complex these phenomena are, and not
oversimplify what we do.]{.underline} So here I will try to live up to
that. [That means [when we talk about]{.mark} these [hunger
crises]{.mark} we shouldn't just ask you to help feed the starving --
though that is desperately needed. [We should]{.mark} also [talk about
conflict.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Human-made crises

Last year, the [[World Bank revised its position on conflict --
upgrading it from being one]{.mark} of many [drivers of
suffering]{.mark} and poverty, [to]{.mark} being [the primary
driver]{.mark}.]{.underline} In Somalia, despite some political
progress, the conflict has put more than half the population in need of
assistance, with 363,000 children suffering acute malnutrition. In
Nigeria, conflict with Boko Haram in the country's northeast has left
1.8 million people still displaced, farmers unable to grow crops, and
4.8 million people in need of food assistance. In Yemen, an escalation
in conflict since 2015 has worsened a situation already made dire by
poor governance, poverty and weak rule of law. Now more than 14 million
people need food aid.

Only if we understand conflict can we understand these hunger crises.
South Sudan is another acute example. I worked there for two years
following the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2005 and
know it well.

Right now a place called Koch, where Mercy Corps works, is in what
FEWSNET (the famine early warning system) calls a 'level 4 emergency
phase', which means that individuals and families will start to die of
hunger in a matter of months if they don't receive enough aid. But until
recent years, Koch was a thriving community with fertile land. It has
been destroyed in armed clashes since conflict broke out in South Sudan
in December 2013. Families have been displaced multiple times and they
have reported rampant communal disease due to the lack of clean water.
As a father of five told our team in Koch: "I have lost everything; my
house was burnt, everything was looted and I do not know how to rebuild
my life."

[Across the places we work, [where people are facing starvation, the
pattern is the same. Hunger is not some]{.mark} freak [environmental
event; it is human-made, the result of]{.mark} a deadly mix of
[conflict, marginalization, and weak governance.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Long-term solutions

[In South Sudan, as in Somalia, Nigeria and Yemen [it is not]{.mark}
generally [a lack of food that has caused famine]{.mark}-like conditions
to occur. [The crises exist because of]{.mark} violence and
[conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} They don't need more food, they need
investment into conflict prevention and the stability that brings.

Of course that is easier said than done. Addressing the root causes of
conflict and building resilience to crisis is extremely difficult and
complicated. But organisations like Mercy Corps are constantly
developing new and better ways to deliver peace-building and conflict
prevention, particularly at community level. We need these long-term,
complex approaches to be supported, because they may mean we do not need
another famine appeal. We also need people to understand that we are
trying to address the underlying causes.

The World Economic Forum\'s Global Agenda Council on Fragility, Violence
and Conflict found that corporate partners can foster stable, inclusive
and prosperous societies that respect the rule of law and benefit from
accountable governance. Both local and multinational businesses can play
an important role, often working alongside each other to support and
grow local and national economies and, in the process, help support
efforts undertaken by others to reduce fragility and conflict.

I am not for a moment suggesting we shouldn't support crisis appeals.
Once a community is in the grip of famine it needs assistance, and fast.
These responses save lives. [But [unless we]{.mark} take time to
[understand]{.mark} and support long-term approaches like [conflict
prevention]{.mark} and peace-building, [we will]{.mark} continue to
[find ourselves wrestling with protracted crises]{.mark}, forced
migration, and the associated security issues that affect every one of
us.]{.underline}

#### US crops don't solve food crisis -- they don't go to affected countries and they're not nutritional -- experts agree.

And this is why the words [[\"feed the world\" grate on]{.mark} the
[nerves]{.mark}]{.underline} of people who believe that large-scale,
technology-driven agriculture is bad for the environment and often bad
for people.

Margaret [[Mellon, a scientist with]{.mark} the environmental advocacy
group [Union of Concerned Scientists]{.mark}]{.underline}, recently
wrote an essay in which she confessed to developing an allergy to that
phrase. \"If there\'s a controversy, the show-stopper is supposed to be,
\'We have to use pesticides, or we won\'t be able to feed the world!\'
\" she says.

[Mellon [says]{.mark} it\'s time to set that idea aside.]{.underline} It
doesn\'t answer the concerns that people have about modern agriculture
--- and [[it\'s not even true.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[American]{.mark}-style [farming doesn\'t]{.mark} really [grow food for
hungry people]{.mark}, she says. [Forty percent of]{.mark} the biggest
crop --- [corn --- goes into fuel]{.mark} for cars. [Most]{.mark} of the
second-biggest crop --- [soybeans --- is fed to
animals.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Growing [more grain isn\'t the solution to hunger anyway]{.mark}, she
says. If you\'re really trying to solve that problem, [there\'s a long
list of other steps that are]{.mark} much [more
important]{.mark}.]{.underline} \"We need to empower women; we need to
raise incomes; we need infrastructure in the developing world; we need
the ability to get food to market without spoiling.\"

It seemed that this dispute needed a referee. So I called Christopher
[[Barrett, an economist at Cornell]{.mark} University who [studies
international agriculture]{.mark} and poverty.]{.underline}

\"They\'re both right,\" he says, chuckling. \"Sometimes the opposite of
a truth isn\'t a falsehood, but another truth, right?\"

It\'s true, he says, that bigger harvests in the U.S. tend to make food
more affordable around the world, and \"lower food prices are a good
thing for poor people.\"

For instance, Chinese pigs are growing fat on cheap soybean meal grown
by farmers in the U.S. and Brazil, and that\'s one reason why hundreds
of millions of people in China are eating much better than a generation
ago --- they can afford to buy pork. So American farmers who grow
soybeans are justified in saying that they help feed the world.

But [Mellon is right]{.underline}, too, [[Barrett says. The]{.mark} big
[crops that American farmers send abroad don\'t provide the
vitamins]{.mark} and minerals [that billions of people need
most]{.mark}. So if the U.S. exports lots of corn, driving down the cost
of cornmeal, \"it induces poor families to buy lots of cornmeal, and to
buy less in the way of leafy green vegetables, or milk,\" that have the
key nutrients. In this case, [you\'re feeding the world, but not
solving]{.mark} the [nutrition]{.mark} problems.]{.underline}

Arnot, from the Center for Food Integrity, recently did a survey, asking
consumers whether they think the U.S. even has a responsibility to
provide food to the rest of the world. Only 13 percent of these
consumers strongly agreed.

In focus groups, many people said that if feeding the world means more
industrial-scale farming, they\'re not comfortable with it.

This is not a message farmers like to hear. \"It is a real sense of
frustration for farmers that \'feeding the world\' is no longer a
message that resonates with the American public,\" Arnot says.

He tells farm groups that they\'ll have to find another message.
They\'ll need to show that the way they grow food is consistent with the
values of American consumers.

[[We've heard]{.underline}]{.mark} it all our lives: [[American farmers
feed the world]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Once it was a simple expression of pride. Since the 1970s it has morphed
into a justification for resisting changes in industrial-scale
agricultural practices that would reduce environmental harm from
pesticides, runoff, excessive groundwater pumping ... the list goes on
and on.

But if feeding the world's hungry has become a handy rationalization for
unfettered farming, the slogan is increasingly taking on the tone of
pressing moral imperative:

The world's population is on track to reach 9 billion by 2050 and that
will require increasing global food output by somewhere between 60 and
100 percent. Nobody's in a better position to tackle that challenge than
American farmers, who already feed the world.

[[But do they?]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Some [statistics from]{.mark} a piercing analysis published yesterday
by [the Environmental Working Group]{.mark}, based on fairly simple
calculations from United Nations and U.S. Department of Agriculture
data]{.underline} regarding this country's 25 largest ag export products
in 2015:

[[America's top 20 customers]{.mark} for those products --- 19 nations
plus the European Union --- [got 86 percent of the]{.mark} total value
of the [exports]{.mark}, or about \$114.4 billion.]{.underline}

[[All of these countries rank]{.mark} fairly [high in]{.mark} a U.N.
rating of [development status]{.mark}]{.underline} --- think Canada (the
No. 1 importer), the EU (4), Japan (5), South Korea (6), Australia (14),
Saudi Arabia (16).

With two exceptions --- India (18) and Guatemala (20) --- these
countries also rank fairly low in the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization's scoring of hunger and malnourishment. (India and
Guatemala share a middling rank of "moderately high.")

[[For the]{.mark} 19 [nations]{.mark} of the world [that rank as
hungriest]{.mark} in the FAO scoring, [U.S. exports were]{.mark} far
[smaller, contributing]{.mark} on average 2.3 percent of total food
supply. Looking at this flow from the origin end of the pipeline, [only
one-half of 1 percent of all U.S. ag exports]{.mark} in 2015 went to the
19 hungriest countries --- and fully 63 percent of that stream went to
just two of them, Haiti and Yemen.]{.underline}

[Collectively, [the richest group received 158 times as much]{.mark}
imported U.S. food [as the poorest.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The EWG report also looked at historical data and found that these
patterns haven't changed much in the past 10 years, especially in
regarded to our wealthier customers; membership in the top 20 has
changed little and their aggregate share of U.S. ag exports averaged 85
percent over the decade.

It's a slightly different story with [the [poor countries]{.mark}, to
which [exports have actually declined]{.mark}]{.underline}. America's
contribution to their food supply "has not changed significantly since
2004, ranging from a low of 2 percent to a high of 4.4 percent from 2004
through 2013, but the U.S. share of total food aid has dropped."

In 2004, the U.S. contributed 78.1 percent of the food aid to the
hungriest countries, but by 2013 it was down to 48.9 percent. The share
of the hungriest countries' total food supplies provided by food aid and

#### USMCA ensures a rise in drug prices, decreasing access to live saving medicine

The longstanding debate in the United States on its sky-high
prescription drug prices and access to health care is raging where you
might least expect it --- within the pages of President Trump's new
trade deal: the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

[[Critics of]{.mark} the [USMCA are]{.mark} very [concerned]{.mark} that
[it would increase medicine prices]{.mark} in North America and
strengthen the hand of one of the world\'s most powerful
industries.]{.underline}

At Boston University's Global Development Policy Center and School of
Public Health, we have been studying the impact of trade treaties on
access to medicines and can confirm that there is real truth to these
concerns. They require policy action.

At issue is a section of the [USMCA that would protect pharmaceutical
companies with new biologics from generic competition, so-called
\"biosimilars.\"]{.underline}

Biologic medicines come from living cells that contain proteins and
other materials that can treat diseases and conditions like cancer,
rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.

"Biosimilar" medicines are similarly composed drugs that are approved
for marketing when presenting data demonstrating that there is no
clinically meaningful difference in their safety, quality and efficacy
from the original biologic.

[[Biologics have been found to be the]{.mark} most significant [driver
of]{.mark} prescription medicine [prices]{.mark}]{.underline}. Citing a
report by IQVIA Institute, Forbes magazine reported that "biologic drugs
represented 2 percent of all U.S. prescriptions, but 37 percent of net
drug spending. Since 2014, biologic drugs account for nearly all of the
growth in net drug spending: 93 percent of it, in fact."

For this reason, many have argued to lower the number of years for
biologic exclusivity, not increase them.

[Even though only 2 percent of patients in the U.S. use biologic
medicines, they represent 40 percent of total prescribing drug
expenditure]{.underline}. It has been estimated that biosimilar medicine
costs on average 30-percent less than the originator biologic medicine.

Promotion of biosimilar medicines in the U.S. could save consumers
billions of dollars. According to Federal Drug Administration
Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, the anticompetitive tactics used by
manufacturers of biologic medicines are one reason market entry of
biosimilar medicines is so slow.

A new tactic is the USMCA, which under Article 20 F. 14 would grant at
least a 10-year "test data" exclusivity period for new biologics.
Currently, Canada has an eight-year test data exclusivity period and
Mexico has a five-year limit, so the USMCA would force both countries to
increase this period.

[[Granting exclusivity]{.mark} essentially [gives a]{.mark}
pharmaceutical [company monopoly rights]{.mark} that free the firm from
competition [and allows it to charge higher prices]{.mark} than it would
under competitive conditions]{.underline}.

In a comprehensive review of the literature, we find that, generally,
[[exclusivity rules]{.mark} like these in past trade agreements have
tended to [raise the prices of medicines.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In fact, in a study we did specific to biologics, we found that
provisions that protect biologics in the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement
increased the unit price of biologics in Chile.

In many ways, these measures are a form of mercantilism for the
interests of firms in leading economic sectors, rather than \"free
trade\" that would create more competition and lower prices.

Indeed, the pharmaceutical industry is the most active lobby group when
it comes to trade agreements. One analysis of the Trans-Pacific
Partnership (TPP) --- a deal that was scrapped --- stated that it ended
up having many of the same provisions for pharmaceuticals and biologics
that the USMCA has.

That analysis by Sunlight Foundation found that pharmaceutical companies
and their associations mentioned the TPP in 251 separate lobbying
reports --- two-and-a-half times more than the next-most active
industry, the auto sector.

Pharmaceutical companies argue that since test data is so expensive to
produce, it is an unfair advantage to let other companies rely on that
data without cost. Biologics research and development is supposedly a
higher-risk endeavor, with:

higher capital costs,

higher material costs,

greater manufacturing costs and uncertainties,

longer development times, and

lower late-stage success rates compared to biosimilar drugs.

According to pharma, a failure to include substantial data exclusivity
as part of a statutory framework for "biosimilars" would undermine
incentives to invest in biomedical innovation and thus would slow
progress in the development of breakthrough therapies for patients
suffering from currently untreatable conditions.

Recent research published in Nature Biotechnology calls this rationale
into question. The authors found no evidence that developing biologic
drugs was more time-intensive than traditional small-molecule
(biosimilar) medicines.

The study\'s lead author wrote: \"Our study shows that biologic and
small molecule drugs take a similar amount of time to develop through
clinical trials. Policies intended to extend exclusivity periods for
biologics, as Canada is now doing due to the USMCA trade deal, should
not be justified by pointing to longer pre-market development times for
biologic drugs.\"

Given the new evidence that developing biologic drugs is not more
time-intensive, it is necessary to reconsider the period of market
exclusivity for such innovation that would not unduly favor one type
over others.

[Whatever reward for [innovation]{.mark} the policymakers choose, it
[should not impede access to]{.mark} such innovation for [those who most
need it.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Spiking drug prices are immoral and deplete spending from other social programs, locking in structural violence

**Klitzman 18** (Robert Klitzman is a professor of psychiatry and
director of the Masters of Bioethics Program at Columbia University,
9-18-2018, \"Huge price hikes by drug companies are immoral,\" CNN,
<https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/18/opinions/nostrum-immoral-price-hikes-klitzman/index.html>)
cliv

(CNN)Several pharmaceutical companies have been jacking up the prices of
their drugs in unethical ways. Most recently, Nirmal Mulye, founder and
president of Nostrum Pharmaceuticals, defended his decision to more than
quadruple the price of nitrofurantoin, used to treat bladder infections,
from about \$500 to more than \$2,300 a bottle. He said it was his
\"moral requirement to sell the product at the highest price.\"

Mulye argues that his only moral duty is to benefit his investors. As he
said in defending Martin Shkreli, who in 2015 raised the price of an
anti-parasite drug, daraprim, 5,000% from \$13.50 to \$750 per tablet,
\"When he raised the price of his drug he was within his rights because
he had to reward his shareholders.\"

Mulye is wrong for many reasons. [[Drug companies]{.mark} deserve
reasonable return on their investment in research and development, but
some of these companies [are abusing the system. The development
of]{.mark} countless [new drugs]{.mark} depends on taxpayer money and
[sacrifices]{.mark} that [patients]{.mark} in studies make in good
faith. [Excessive price hikes harm many]{.mark} people, [threaten public
health]{.mark} [and deplete huge amounts of taxpayer money]{.mark} that
could be better used in other ways.]{.underline}

The US government pays more than 40% of all Americans\' prescription
costs, and this amount has been growing faster than inflation. In 2015,
over 118 million Americans were on some form of government health
insurance, including around 52 million on Medicare and 62 million on
Medicaid. And these numbers have been increasing. Today, around 59
million Americans are on Medicare and 75 million on Medicaid.

And, in 2016, Medicare and Medicaid alone spent \$174 billion on
prescriptions drugs \-- 23% of their entire budget. In short, the
government spends more on health care than it spends on any other single
segment of the federal budget, including defense or Social Security.

The United States already spends significantly more on drugs than any
other country \-- over twice as much as the average of the 19 major
other industrialized countries. In the United States, one drug is even
approaching close to \$1 million per person per year. And
[[while]{.mark} Mulye and Shkreli [have increased]{.mark} the [prices of
brand-name drugs, other companies have raised the prices of
generic]{.mark} medications, [which require no new research or
development]{.mark} \-- often [the excuse used for excessive]{.mark}
drug [prices]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Partly as a result, the [United States spends about twice as much per
person on health as do other Western countries, and this gap is growing.
Yet we rank 26th in the world in life expectancy]{.underline}. People
live longer in Chile and Slovenia than in the United States.

[These [high drug costs prevent many]{.mark} Americans [from accessing
vital treatments]{.mark} \-- meaning [they are at risk of]{.mark}
getting sicker or [dying]{.mark}. In recent surveys conducted by the
Kaiser Family Foundation, over 20% of Americans have difficulty
affording their prescribed medications, 24% say they or a family member
has not filled a prescription, cut pills in half or skipped doses due to
high costs, and 80% say the cost of prescription drugs is
unreasonable]{.underline}. Regardless of whether they are Republicans or
Democrats, most Americans think more regulation is needed to limit
prescription drug prices.

[These higher [drug costs limit our nation\'s ability to support other
programs]{.mark} as much as we could \-- [from rebuilding aging bridges
and roads, and creating more jobs, to enhancing education]{.mark} and
public radio and television]{.underline}

Rapidly mounting government drug expenditures result partly from the
fact that over the past decade, the pharmaceutical industry has spent
\$2.3 billion in lobbying efforts \-- more than any other industry since
1998. Not surprisingly, while other Western countries negotiate prices
with pharmaceutical companies, Congress has barred Medicare from doing
so.

These huge price increases are also unjustified since the US government,
through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other agencies,
funds much of the basic science that enables pharmaceutical companies to
develop new medications. Countless drug company researchers and
physicians are also educated through National Science Foundation grants
and government-subsidized hospitals and state universities.

Every year, Congress and the President debate how much to support these
various agencies. Last year, Trump proposed slashing the NIH budget by
22%. Over the past 10 years, this budget has already been decreasing
when adjusted for inflation. Luckily, Congress ultimately rejected
Trump\'s proposed cuts \-- but all of this funding, on which the
pharmaceutical industry depends, clearly hinges on public support, and
thus on the public feeling that it receives fair return on its
generosity.

Moreover, thousands of patients enter studies, risking harm or even
death, in order to help develop new drugs to aid future patients.
Countless patients willingly share their genetic and other medical data
to benefit science and other patients.

[Exorbitant price gouging is also shortsighted and
counterproductive.]{.underline} This year alone, 24 states, including
Maryland, New York and Nevada, have passed 37 bills to reduce increasing
drug costs. Additional bills under consideration would prohibit unfair
pricing, cap annual price hikes and require companies to release
information on prices and costs.

President Donald Trump promised to cut drug prices and has declared a
victory in doing so, but Mulye\'s and other companies\' price hikes
demonstrate otherwise. Parts of Trump\'s proposals also seem to help
drug companies more than consumers, reducing programs that require drug
companies to lower costs to institutions that serve poorer patients. The
fate of his proposals is unclear. But if he is truly interested in
curbing drug company prices, he should set criteria for new drug prices
and establish caps on annual price increases.

[[Physicians have]{.mark} long [followed the Hippocratic Oath, with its
moral commitments to prioritize patients\' well-being and first do no
harm.]{.mark} Nostrum and other drug companies should recognize the
importance of helping not just shareholders, but patients. [At stake is
our individual and nation\'s health]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

If we're ever going to lower the exorbitant costs Americans pay for
healthcare in the U.S., we need to start looking at the problem
holistically. While drug prices are often in the news, it's not the only
challenge American's face. In fact, while [[nearly a **quarter** of the
population has]{.underline} [trouble paying **prescription drug
prices**]{.underline}]{.mark}, medical bills are an even bigger issue,
as they are now the leading cause of bankruptcy in the U.S. Identifying
and treating one symptom of the problem isn't going to cure the
underlying epidemic. Consider, for example, what happens when a patient
skips filling their prescription. As former Surgeon General C. Everett
Koop once said, "[[Drugs don't work in patients who don't take

If there's anything Donald Trump hates more than globalist trade deals
that restrict U.S. sovereignty, it's the exorbitant cost of
pharmaceuticals in this country.

"The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower
the cost of health care and prescription drugs," the president said in
his most recent State of the Union Address. "It is unacceptable that
Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact
same drugs, often made in the exact same place."

And yet, [the president's new version of NAFTA --- the uncreatively
named United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement ([USMCA]{.mark}) ---
actually [forbids]{.mark} the U.S. [Congress from curtailing Big
Pharma's patent monopolies on]{.mark} some of the world's most
[expensive drugs]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words: [Trump's "America
First" trade deal restricts U.S. sovereignty, for the sake of locking in
high drug prices]{.underline}.

In the U.S. today, [drug [companies that produce new "biologics]{.mark}"
--- specialty drugs made with living cells --- are [provided 12 years of
immunity from]{.mark} generic [competition]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [This
awards]{.underline}]{.mark} [such firms [monopolistic pricing power
over]{.mark} their (often [life-saving) medicines for more than a
decade]{.mark} after their wares hit the market.]{.underline} The
rationale for this policy is that companies will not invest in high-cost
biologic research if they aren't guaranteed windfall profits for their
innovations. But even if one accepts this (tendentious) premise, a
12-year monopoly appears both arbitrary and excessive. In Mexico,
biologic makers are only immunized against competition from so-called
"biosimilars" for five years; in Canada, such protections last eight.
Congressional Democrats have drafted legislation that would cut the
duration of biologic monopolies down to seven years.

But [if Trump's revised version of NAFTA takes effect, [Democrats will
not have]{.mark} the [legal authority to advance]{.mark} that
[legislation]{.mark} --- because the [USMCA guarantees]{.mark} biologic
makers [at least a ten-year monopoly]{.mark} on their new drugs across
all three of North America's major economies]{.underline}.

[House Democrats say [that's unacceptable]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the
administration pushes to get its trade deal through Congress, Nancy
Pelosi's caucus has made striking the provision on biologics one of it
top demands.

If the rule isn't rolled back, "I don't think candidly that it passes
out of my trade subcommittee," Earl Blumenauer of Oregon told the
Associated Press in February. "The biologics are some of the most
expensive drugs on the planet." Even staunchly pro-trade border-state
Democrats are drawing a red line on the rule, with Texas's Lloyd Doggett
calling it "totally contrary to Trump's professed interest in lower drug
prices."

It isn't hard to see why Democrats are picking this fight. Few issues
are more salient to a broader, more bipartisan swath of voters than the
rising cost of prescription drugs. In January, a [Politico-Harvard poll
found 80 percent of Americans saying that congressional "action to lower
prescription medicine prices is extremely important,"]{.underline}
making it the top issue for voters in both parties. Meanwhile, in recent
focus groups with soft Trump supporters, Democratic operatives say that
the biologics issue has proven explosively potent.

Greater consumption of pharmaceuticals accounts for some of the
differences in pharmaceutical spending between different countries.
Another factor is that pharmaceutical prices are consistently greater in
the United States than abroad. There is no satisfactory justification
for the pricing disparity.

Policymakers are scrutinizing high prices for specialty drugs like never
before. Gilead's Sovaldi at \$84,000 for a treatment course is in part
to blame \-- or credit \-- for this, but so are Vertex' Kalydeco,
Merck's Keytruda , and a series of other six figure drugs.

The [[pharmaceutical industry has responded]{.mark} in a predictable
way. [High prices are needed to fuel the fire of innovation]{.mark} they
explain.]{.underline} True. Absent a potential return, investors would
certainly stay far away. But what about the follow on question? [[Just
how high do prices need to be]{.mark}? Wh[en does the potential to
profit exceed that which is needed to drive innovation]{.mark} and
pervert the market?]{.underline}

[I think [we're already there]{.mark}]{.underline}. Case in point: there
are seven drugs in human trials that target lung or and/or other cancers
caused by an acquired genetic abnormality called the ALK rearrangement
(Figure). Roche's Alectinib is in Phase 3. Ariad, Tesaro, Pfizer and
Ignyta all have agents in Phase 2. There are four more compounds soon to
enter human testing. That's a lot of drugs that all target the same
cancer causing mechanism.

Maybe this would make sense if ALK rearranged lung cancer constituted a
vast market. But it doesn't. The key first and second line indications
in lung cancer are already occupied by Pfizer's Xalkori and Novartis'
Zykadia, respectively. And only three to eight percent of metastatic
lung cancers are driven by the ALK alteration, which amounts to only a
few thousand patients per year in the US.

If it's not a huge market, then why the ALK drug mosh pit?

[I think [its high drug prices]{.mark}. The Federal Medicare program,
and most private insurers, must include new cancer drugs on formulary
regardless of their price or the existence of cheaper alternatives. And
as [the industry has continued to test the waters with higher and higher
prices]{.mark}, its gone swimmingly but for a few pointed editorials and
stories of patients driven into bankruptcy]{.underline}.

[[With high prices available to every new drug]{.mark} for cancer,
[companies are stumbling over one another in a race down a well trodden
molecular road to profits. That makes pursuing high risk innovation a
less attractive option]{.mark}, even though that will be how we get
novel drugs that tackle unmet needs. Drugs that will rely on mechanisms
that today still seem hypothetical.]{.underline}

You might say that it's not one or the other, but if so, then the whole
argument about why we need high prices to fuel innovation falls apart.
There are apparently only so many investment dollars to go around, so
dollars going to generate yet another drug for ALK are dollars away from
a new idea that hasn't yet been proven. Same goes for the research
infrastructure, and for the patients enrolling on these studies.

on an **economically strong**]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and West. In 1945, the United States was the only
victor that was not completely devastated. World War II had brought the
country out of the Great Depression, and the US GDP constituted more
than 50 percent of the world's total. Into the twenty-first century, the
members of the Group of Seven (G7) were the world's political and
economic heavyweights. It has only been in the past several years that
the collective GDP of the developing world---led by China---has
surpassed the developed world's. Even as non-Western powers grow, it is
psychologically hard for the West to think about relinquishing its
reins. Demographically, the West has, for a long time, been in the
minority. What's more recent is [the ag[i]{.mark}ng of the Western
population]{.underline} (analyzed in chapter 2), which [is]{.underline}
already occurring in Japan and Europe, [beginning to squeeze the
availability of resources for anything but health]{.underline}, social
security, and interest payments on debt. [[Unless **healthcare** becomes
far more efficient, the]{.mark} US [economy will be
**overburdened**]{.mark} with healthcare and pension costs as the "baby

whopping **[18 percent of]{.mark} the US [GDP]{.mark}**---significantly
more than is the case for other industrialized countries---without
necessarily providing better results]{.underline}. [With more going to

probably will not rival the United States' power-projection capabilities
even by 2035, but it [[will have]{.mark} greater [anti-access and denial
powers]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a military contest, China may never be
able to deliver a knockout blow, but it could tarnish the US image of
military invincibility in a conventional state-on-state contest held in
its region. Equally, [a [confrontation]{.mark} that results in a Chinese
humiliation [could]{.mark}]{.underline} set back China's aspirations for
regional leadership, if not [[trigger a]{.mark} **domestic legitimacy
[crisis]{.mark}** for the Communist Party leadership]{.underline}.
Biggest Problem Is Domestic The biggest psychological blow to ordinary
Western citizens has been their sagging standard of living (more
analysis in chapter 1). Despite a much better record of overall growth
in the United States since the 2008 financial crisis, those with median
incomes have taken a hit Worrisome for future US growth potential has
been the drop in the labor-participation rate, from the 67 percent range
before the 2008 financial crisis to 62-63 percent in the years since.
The labor-participation rate was destined to drop due to a growing
numbers of retirees, but much of the current sharp decrease comes from
unskilled males in their prime working years---forties and early
fifties---dropping out. Additionally, many younger women are not
entering or staying in the job market. Global Trends 2030 looked at two
scenarios for future US growth---one in which the United States
maintained or slightly increased its average 2.5 percent pre-2008 growth
rate, or one in which growth would slow to an average of 1.5 percent a
year. In the first, there would still be the global economic shift to
China. On the other hand, the 2.5 percent average growth would help
boost average living standards, engendering a "feel-good" factor, which
would make more Americans interested in reengaging with world issues.91
[Given the record of slower growth and labor-force decline since the
2008 financial crisis, [the **likelihood**]{.mark} of the second
scenario [is **increasing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [That scenario
anticipated lower growth rates---which accelerated declines in average
living standards---making it harder to continue trade-liberalization
efforts]{.underline}. Indeed, the IMF warned in June 2016 that
[the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [faces
potentially significant longer-term challenges to strong and sustained
growth]{.underline}, saying, "concerted [policy actions are warranted,
sooner rather than]{.underline} later... [focusing on]{.underline} the
causes and consequences of falling labor force participation, an
increasingly polarized income distribution, high levels of poverty, and
[weak productivity]{.underline}."92 Moreover, it is not as if
traditional US partners---Europe and Japan---are doing much better.
Japan and many European countries are aging faster than the United
States, eliminating labor-force growth as a driver of future economic
growth. Europe's and Japan's economic performances have been declining
since the 1990s. In Europe, the public discontent with high unemployment
and declining incomes has helped to spur the rise of antiestablishment
far-right and populist parties that want to weaken the EU and
transatlantic ties. Even in richer European countries, such as Germany,
a backlash has been growing against the Transatlantic Trade and
Investment Partnership (TTIP), out of fear that Europe's rewards would
be meager and European standards would be diluted. McKinsey Global
Institute, for example, believes a "return to sustained growth of 2-to-3
percent" is possible for Europe, but would require many politically
difficult reforms.93 These include: reducing dependence on imports (much
coming from Russia) for crude oil and natural gas; fostering a more
vibrant digital economy; increasing workforce participation by the
elderly, women, and migrants; and promoting flexibility in labor
markets. China now spends a greater share of its GDP on research and
development than does Europe. The latest OECD figures show that Europe
now spends even less than the rest of the OECD.94 In both the United
States and Europe, there is increasing anti-immigrant sentiment despite
documented economic benefits from immigration. According to EU
Commission Employment Analyst Dr. Jorg Peschner, productivity, by
itself, will not be enough to reverse the negative employment trend
absent more immigration: "EU's productivity growth would have to double
in order to keep the EU's economy growing at the same pace as it did
before the crisis started." For employment growth to remain positive as
long as possible, improving the labor participation of women,
low-educated people, and migrants will also have to be a priority. In
the United States, many of the new businesses started every year are
started by first- or second-generation immigrants.95 [Politically, there
has been a large [rise in support for]{.mark} right-wing and **[populist
parties]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the United States and Europe,
undermining traditional parties. The gaps, for example, between the
leadership and supporters in the US Republican and UK Tory and Labor
Parties have been particularly [evident in the selection of]{.underline}
Donald [Trump]{.underline} as presidential candidate and the June 2016
victory of the "Leave" vote in Britain. Unfortunately, there is no end
of economic disruption. [The job churn will continue as more and more
skills and professions are automated, also increasing the **potential**
for more "losers" from globalization, greater political polarization,
and inequality]{.underline}. [The increased competitiveness of the
developing world with the West is a particular morale buster for Western
middle classes who got used to ever-increasing prosperity for themselves
and succeeding generations]{.underline}. [Adapting to a new norm of
economic turbulence---more prevalent in other eras---may be one of the
biggest mental hurdles for Westerners]{.underline}. The West is used to
thinking of the "Third World," not home, as the place where economic
turmoil happens. And a Multipolar Financial Architecture, Too
[Historically, US and Western power has rested on having a **monopoly on
reserve currencies** and a Western-dominated financial
system]{.underline}. In 2035, the dollar will be the biggest reserve
currency, but its share of global financial transactions is expected to
drop from 60 percent today to 45 percent. The euro will probably remain
the second reserve currency, while the Chinese yuan or RMB---which
became a part of the IMF benchmark-currency basket in 2015---will become
a third reserve currency, accounting for 10 to 15 percent of global
finance in two decades' time.96 [The financial architecture
will]{.underline} also [become more regionalized]{.underline}. The
central role played by the financial centers of New York and London will
also diminish, and a multitiered financial architecture will develop.
Following the UK Brexit, those centers' share in financial
intermediation will decrease, as a second pole of global finance forms
in the Eurozone. A third pole will develop in East Asia and Southeast
Asia. Gradually, a growing share of global financial resources will be
concentrated in those regional clusters. As with the growth of regional
trade, the regional clusters will be more self-encapsulated, spurred by
rising domestic demand in China and other developing countries with
growing middle classes. With the role of electronic money likely to
grow, the traditional banking system will probably also undergo major
revision, with potential impacts on governmental powers. A more
multipolar reserve system and regionalized financial architecture should
lessen risks and contribute to greater stability. But the large-scale
technological innovations---some of which contributed to the 2008
breakdown---will continue, making global finance still volatile.
Emerging-market countries with fragmentary regulatory regimes will be
particularly prone to suffering financial crises. The aging-population
factor also increases risks to public finances. This report anticipates
modestly increased volatility, lower than what occurred in the global
economy during the 1890s through the 1940s, but higher than in the 1950s
and 1960s---more of a continuation of what has been the trend line since
the mid-1980s. Are There Alternative Visions to Western Order? Four
years ago, when Global Trends 2030 was published, the answer was largely
no.97 Increasingly, the facts on the ground would suggest otherwise.
They do not add up to a cohesive plan to substitute wholesale all
Western institutions and practices. However, they clearly indicate that
there are some no-go areas, particularly those connected to regime
change, democracy promotion, state control over NGOs, and maintaining
sovereignty. [Russia and China]{.underline}, in particular, [see
themselves as great powers and]{.underline}, as such, [believe they have
special rights to dominance in their regions]{.underline}. However, [as
other powers like India develop, it is likely that they will see
themselves as regional powers with inherent prerogatives]{.underline}.
It is worth recalling the United States' expansive Manifest Destiny and
nineteenth-century Monroe Doctrine, claiming special rights to determine
the future of the Western Hemisphere. The Mercator Institute for China
Studies (MERICS) has been closely following Beijing's efforts to build a
network of parallel structures to existing international organizations.
It has concluded that China "is not seeking to demolish or exit from
current international organizations...It is constructing
supplementary--- in part complementary, in part competitive---channels
for shaping the international order beyond Western claims to
leadership."98 As the accompanying chart indicates, China's shadow
network of alternative international structures encompasses everything
from financial and economic partnerships (the Silk Road Economic Belt
and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank) to full-blown political
groupings like the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Conference on
Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA), and the
BRICS association of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.99
Moreover, there is increasing cooperation among many of the emerging
powers---beyond just authoritarians---to not just limit what they see as
Western meddling in domestic affairs, but to go on the attack globally.
According to a recent academic study, the "Big Five" authoritarian
states of China, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela "have taken
more coordinated and decisive action to contain democracy on the global
level." They have sought to "alter the democracy and human-rights
mechanisms of key rules-based institutions, including the Organization
of American States, the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, and international bodies concerned with the
governance of the Internet."100 How durable are these preferences for
nondemocracy and state control? By 2035, if not sooner (in the case of
Venezuela), some of the now-authoritarian states could be liberalized,
and the perceived threat posed by Western civil-society NGOs may ease.
However, China and Russia are more likely than not to want to dominate
their regions. Nationalism and democracy have been shown to be highly
compatible. It is not clear that an even more powerful China or India
would defer to Western leadership of the global order, even if both
sides' values in other areas begin to converge. What Kind of
Post-Western World? [Clearly, there is a need to plan for a world that
will not have the West as its big economic powerhouse]{.underline}---a
prospect hard for Western elites and publics to conceive of, despite a
decade or more of publicity about the "rise of the rest." According to a
recent survey, Europeans and Americans are more comfortable with each
other than they are with anybody else. Although a majority of Europeans
said, in the most recent German Marshall Fund transatlantic-trends
polling, that they would like to see their country take an approach more
independent from the United States, both Americans and Europeans still
prefer each other over more Russian or Chinese leadership in the world.
The Obama administration---considered among the most multilateralist of
recent administrations--- campaigned hard in 2015 to convince Europeans
not to join China's proposed Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank
(AIIB). It was as if the United States was against any governance
structure not "made in the USA," even when those running the AIIB have
made clear their intentions of operating with the World Bank and the
Asian Development Bank. More and more, the talk among Western elites is
about locking in as much as possible the status quo, which favors the
West, so that it will be harder for the newcomers to overcome. The TPP
was sold as a way to set the rules before China gains much more power. A
former Obama administration official advised that now might be the best
time to undertake UN Security Council reform, before China and other
uncooperative powers become more powerful. "A new US administration may
be able to advance a proposal to address the Security Council's
anachronistic makeup while perpetuating a council that Washington can
work with."101 For Westerners, [the challenge will be to plan for a
future that will not be solely run by them, but which they can live
with]{.underline}. [[Handovers have been **historically**]{.mark}
difficult and fraught---more often than not, [decided by **bloody
contests**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[One could
envisage]{.underline}]{.mark} different scenarios, some already
described in the earlier chapter on conflict, of [[**military contests**
between the]{.underline}]{.mark} [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [and [China]{.mark}, or the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [[and]{.mark} China with
[Russia]{.mark}, or the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [with NATO against Russia]{.underline}. Without
delivering a knockout blow by one side or the other, [these contests
would most likely pit West against East, [creating]{.mark} something
akin to [a **new Cold War**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Even if there were a
knockout blow by the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [against China, it is hard to imagine a defeated
China deferring permanently to the West]{.underline}. Its population has
been imbued with such a narrative about the injustices by the West
against China that any defeat or setback would be confirmation that the
United States and West are dead set against a rising China. Perhaps the
most harmful effect of such a contest would be to convince both sides
that neither is trustworthy. For the non-West, it would confirm the
suspicion that the West does not want to relinquish its leadership
position. For the West, [it would make it harder to ever reach out and
help **establish a truly global system**]{.underline}. Need for a
Second-Generation US and Western Leadership Model [War is
not]{.underline}, and should not be, [inevitable]{.underline} as the
West struggles with the growing clout of China and other developing
states on the world stage. [Unlike during other transitions, the tools
exist for ensuring more peaceful outcomes]{.underline}. [They will
require Western acquiescence to greater roles for the developing world
to set and implement new rules of the road for the international
order]{.underline}. A key feature of the post-1945 US design for the
world order is its multilateralist structures. Many of these operate
below most people's radar. This plumbing of the international system has
enabled the daily functioning of globalization. To keep it viable,
China, as well as other developing countries, must be accorded more
representation. There are too many long-term risks involved, for
example, in China having only the equivalent of France's voting rights
in the IMF, when it is the first or second economic power in the world.
This is how resentments are nurtured---all the more dangerous in China's
case because of its underlying "century of humiliation" mental complex.
[As **emerging technologies** come online, the lack of a truly global
institutional framework could be **particularly
dangerous**]{.underline}. [Assuring the future security of the Internet
is particularly important in this regard, because all the new emerging
technologies---bio, 3D printing, robotics, big data---take for granted a
secure, global Internet]{.underline}. Everyone loses if cyber crime and
cyber terrorism undermine the Internet. [In the worstcase scenarios, in
which cyber crime proliferates or strong national borders fragment the
Internet]{.underline}, an Atlantic Council study, as mentioned, found
that [the **economic costs** could be as much as \$**90 trillion** out
to 2030, in addition to the risk of **open conflict**]{.underline}.102
Besides bringing the emerging powers into leadership roles in the
panoply of multilateral institutions, the United States will need to
temper its often "exemptionalist" stance to ensure the survival of the
multilateralist order. According to the Council on Foreign Relations'
Patrick Stewart, a prominent scholar of global governance, one of the
persistent paradoxes of the post-1945 decades has been that the "United
States is at once the world's most vocal champion of a rules-based
international order and the power most insistent on opting out of the
constraints that it hopes to see binding on others."103 [No country has
the networks and connections that the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [does, but the system is now polycentric, rather
than unipolar]{.underline}, and others resent the "exceptional"
privileges that the United States claims. The Global Trends works have
talked about the need for a new model of US global leadership. The
United States needs to be guiding the international system as a "first
among equals," and willing to play by its own rules. Paradoxically,
[there is likely to be no vibrant global-governance system without
US]{.underline} and Western [leadership]{.underline}, but too much
domineering behavior could doom it. Even if the United States adapted
its global role, this is not to say that the tensions and differences
with many emerging powers would all disappear, or that the governance
system would function seamlessly. In addition to the growing number of
new state actors, [the increasing importance of nonstate actors adds a
new complexity to the functioning of global institutions]{.underline}.
Moreover, there are clear-cut differences between the West and emerging
powers on values-based issues, such as democracy promotion and the
responsibility to protect. Many developing-country publics still resent
Western colonialism and equate any intrusion with past historical wrong.
They point to the 2011 humanitarian intervention in Libya, for example,
as cover for the Western goal of regime change. Hence, the UN Security
Council failure to stop the fighting in Syria, with more than two
hundred thousand killed and 7.6 million displaced. Russia and China want
to make a stand against the United States and the West getting their way
and ousting the Assad regime. On the other hand, [the lack of a solution
smacks more of **anarchy** than global governance]{.underline}.
Certainly, it shows one of the gaps that remains, and likely will
remain, limiting global governance because of differences in values.
[The **speed** with which **[new tech]{.mark}**nologies are coming
online and becoming an **important political, military, and economic
tool**---for both good and bad---[carries **big risks**]{.mark} for
global governance]{.underline}. Stewart Patrick lists four potential
[new technologies that "cry out for regulation":]{.underline}
[[**geoengineering**, drones, synthetic biology, and
nanotech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}. [[Without]{.mark} some
**[setting]{.mark} of [rules]{.mark}** for their operation, [there is
the risk of **major**]{.mark} disruptions, if not
**[catastrophes]{.mark}**, stemming from their abuse]{.underline}. [The
recent advances in **synthetic [biology]{.mark}** [lower the bar]{.mark}
to abuse by amateurs and **[terrorists]{.mark}** alike, forever
affecting human DNA]{.underline}. [**[Geoengineering]{.mark}** involves
planetaryscale interventions that [could interfere with]{.mark} complex
[climatic systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. However cumbersome, politically
unpopular, and ineffective at times, [[there is **little alternative**
to]{.mark} increased [global coop]{.mark}eration if one does not want to
see higher risks of conflict and economic degradation]{.underline}.
[Without some sort of bolstered global governance, the West would end up
with less sovereignty in [a **"dog-eat-dog"
world**]{.mark}]{.underline}, in which it was increasingly in the
minority. [But can the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and the West rise to the challenge of investing in
a global-governance system that will not always favor their interests on
every issue?]{.underline} Historically, the United States could be
especially generous because it was on top of the world in about
everything after the Second World War. Europeans came to truly believe
in pooling sovereignty and joint governance after centuries of
internecine conflict. [The **[tough economic times]{.mark}** at home
[have seen]{.mark} US and European [publics become **distrustful**
of]{.mark} overarching [multilateral institutions]{.mark}, believing the
will of the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates or
individual European countries [will not be served]{.underline}. [It
is]{.underline} oftentimes [easier for political leaders to fall in with
the public mood rather than display leadership that might appear to work
against it]{.underline}. [The breakdown of the post-Cold War political
and security order is **irrevocable**]{.underline}. [Not only are there
new powers---particularly China---that do not share the West's vision of
a liberal order, but Western publics themselves have turned against
globalization]{.underline}, which has been the overall megatrend of the
past three decades. [The geopolitical landscape ahead will be much
different]{.underline}. The best case is looking at multipolarity with
limited multilateralism. [In the worst case, that [multipolarity
**evolves into bipolarity** with China, Russia]{.mark}, and their
partners pitted against the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates,
[Europe, Japan, and other allies]{.underline}. [In that scenario,
[conflict would be]{.mark} almost **[inevitable]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### 2ac -- pharma can't solve

#### Pharma isn't developing vaccines- no incentives

has previously worked at The Economist and The Conversation. His writing
has appeared in Nature, The Guardian and The Hindu. He has a PhD in

The Ebola epidemic showed that, if we have the right system in place,
it's possible to come up with new vaccines quickly. All we need to do is
take the next step: [[create vaccines in preparation]{.mark} for when an
outbreak strikes, [rather than reacting after]{.mark} it begins
spreading.]{.underline}

At the World Economic Forum in Davos, a global alliance announced today
that it has secured nearly \$500 million to do just that. The Coalition
for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), created by governments and
nonprofits, has identified a key gap: though the World Health
Organization (WHO) knows which diseases we need to prepare for, we don't
actually have vaccines for them. CEPI aims to use the money to fill the
gap that is stopping the crucial development of such vaccines.

Why doesn't Big Pharma do it?

[[Pharmaceutical companies]{.underline}]{.mark} make money from helping
people live better lives. They also [invest more money into research and
development (R&D), as a proportion of profits, than companies in any
other high-tech industry]{.underline}. These investments often result in
big losses when drugs fail in clinical trials---but when a drug
succeeds, it can lead to billions of dollars in profit. So, in theory,
they should be more than willing to develop and test new vaccines.

But [in recent years pharma companies [are getting less return on their
R&D investment]{.mark}. Lower profits have caused some of these
companies to take extreme steps, such as promoting drugs for indications
they have not been approved for.]{.underline}

On top of that, [[investments in vaccines is especially risky. If there
isn't an outbreak, there is no way to recoup the cost]{.mark} of
developing vaccines. In other words, [the vaccine gap exists because
there's no]{.mark} real [incentive for big pharmaceutical companies to
work on them]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[for]{.underline} global [pharma]{.underline} [companies as they
continue to evolve their business models]{.underline} and position
themselves for structural changes in the industry. Accordingly, we have
revised the rating outlook to negative as we expected rating headroom
for Fitch-rated pharmaceutical [[companies]{.underline}]{.mark} to
[[remain under pressure]{.mark} in 2015]{.underline}. This is reflected
in the Negative Outlook on 28% of the Fitch-rated global pharma universe
(Amgen, BMS, Merck, Bayer). There was one downgrade in the sector during
2014 (AstraZeneca). Financial flexibility has been eroded during 2014 on
the back of a sharp rise in debt-funded M&A activity as companies focus
on boosting scale in therapeutic areas and consumer healthcare. They are
also improving R&D productivity to manage increasing costs and risks of
bringing new drugs to market. [Fitch\'s [sector outlook remains]{.mark}
[stable]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [reflecting]{.underline}]{.mark} that
**[[underlying long-term growth drivers remain

efforts of healthcare authorities to reduce costs, improve outcomes and
focus on patient value. As a result, we [[expect **stable**]{.mark}
operating [performance]{.mark}]{.underline} [in 2015]{.underline}.
Continued M&A, pressure towards increasing shareholder returns
(particularly for US players), as well as the growing exposure to
potentially rising interest rates as a result of increased debt levels
across the sector are key rating risks. In addition, the industry\'s
focus on scale in selected therapeutic areas over diversification, the
execution and integration of recent corporate activity, as well as risks
and costs bringing the competitive late state R&D pipeline to market may
lead to pressures on the business risk profile of individual players. In
aggregate, we expect global pharma sector to continue to display a
strong investment grade credit profile, [[supported by]{.mark}
favourable underlying demographics]{.underline}, [[emerging market
growth]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and anticipated innovation in [specialist
treatment]{.mark} areas]{.underline}, with rating underpinned by strong

stretched rating profiles could be repaired assuming a careful focus on
capital allocation in the sector. The full report, \'2015 Outlook:

**[takes]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**[time]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[is more likely to fail]{.mark} than
succeed]{.underline}**, Ross said. \"[[It]{.mark} really
[takes]{.mark}]{.underline} almost **[[a decade]{.underline}]{.mark}**
from concept to finally put the drug into a vial that you\'re ready to
hand to a physician or a nurse,\" Ross said. \"[**[Very few]{.mark}

[follow]{.underline} a basic set of [procedures]{.underline} throughout
[that]{.underline} can [take]{.underline} an unknown amount of
[time]{.underline} [and pose challenges]{.underline} [all
along]{.underline}, [any one of which could scuttle the entire
enterprise,]{.underline} Ross said. It starts out with the basic,
fundamental research of understanding what the disease is, how it works
and how it might be counteracted. If those stages are successful and
researchers have an idea of a way to attack the disease, they have to
test it on animals to see whether it works at all, and whether it\'s
safe. Before a treatment or vaccine can be tested on living humans,
scientists must conduct two rounds of research on human cells and
tissue, first for safety and then for effectiveness. If all of that is
successful, a drug company then has to get approval from the Food and
Drug Administration and regulators in other countries to sell the
product, which can take years. During those painstaking steps,
researchers and drugmakers always have to think about money. \"It costs
millions of dollars to do human trials,\" Ross said. \"[[Even if you
have a drug that is effective]{.underline}]{.mark}, it really sometimes
comes down to the economics of it. [[If it]{.mark}\'s going to
[cost]{.mark}]{.underline} you way [[more]{.underline}

[[Doctors and researchers]{.mark} are beginning to
[question]{.mark}]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[[outlandish
claims]{.underline}]{.mark}** [being [made by the
media]{.mark}]{.underline} in response to alleged breakthroughs in
cancer research. In an editorial published in the Journal of the
National Cancer Institute (JNCI), several doctors expressed concern that
[news pieces]{.underline} [fail to accurately reflect]{.underline} [the
truth concerning drugs and scientific studies.]{.underline} Drs. Lisa
Schwartz and Steven Woloshin from the Center for Medicine and the Media
at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice in
New Hampshire, along with Dr. Barnett Kramer from JNCI, examined media
claims about a new anti-cancer drug called olaparib that was reported on
in the acclaimed New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Though the
study was uncontrolled and preliminary, some sources were claiming it as
the most important cancer breakthrough in ten years. Another report
exaggerated study findings concerning alcohol and cancer risk. In
response to a study that showed a two-percent increase in breast cancer
risk from drinking one alcoholic beverage a day versus not drinking at
all, one media source produced a headline that said, \"A drink a day
raises a women\'s risk of cancer\", with no mention of the important
details in the article. Perhaps a simple oversight, [the [coverage
failed to]{.mark} accurately [assess the truth]{.mark}]{.underline} and
may have needlessly scared readers concerning alcohol consumption.
[Coverage concerning]{.underline} [[pharma]{.mark}ceutical
drugs]{.underline} [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} often **[[the most
inaccurate]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Aside from the fact that many drug
[[studies are]{.underline} [corrupted]{.underline}]{.mark} [from the
start [because of who is]{.mark}]{.underline} [[bankrolling]{.mark}
them,]{.underline} [[negative findings are]{.underline}]{.mark} often
**[[omitted]{.underline}]{.mark}** from the results
[[while]{.underline}]{.mark} miniscule [[benefits]{.underline} [are
highlighted]{.underline}]{.mark} [[as
breakthroughs]{.underline}]{.mark}. The intensity and rate of severe
negative side effects from pharmaceutical drugs is routinely left out of
mainstream reports concerning drug study results.

1.1.3 Engineered pandemics

For most of human history, natural pandemics have posed the greatest
risk of mass global fatalities.37 However, [there are some reasons to
believe that natural [pandemics are **very unlikely** to cause]{.mark}
human [extinction]{.mark}. Analysis of the]{.underline} International
Union for Conservation of Nature [(IUCN) red list database has shown
that [of the]{.mark} 833 [recorded]{.mark} plant and animal species
[extinctions]{.mark} known to have occurred since 1500, [less than
4%]{.mark} (31 species) [were ascribed to]{.mark} infectious
[disease]{.mark}]{.underline}.38 [[None]{.mark} of the mammals and
amphibians on this list [were globally dispersed, and other
factors]{.mark} aside from infectious disease [also contributed]{.mark}
to their extinction. It therefore seems that [our]{.mark} own
[species]{.mark}, which is [**very numerous**, **globally dispersed**,
and **capable of a**]{.mark} **rational [response]{.mark}** to problems,
[is very unlikely to be killed off]{.mark} by a natural
pandemic]{.underline}. One underlying explanation for this is that
[[highly lethal pathogens]{.mark} can [kill]{.mark} their hosts [before
they]{.mark} have a chance to [spread, so there is]{.mark} a [selective
pressure]{.mark} for pathogens [not to be]{.mark} highly
[lethal]{.mark}. Therefore, [pathogens]{.mark} are likely to
[co-evolve]{.mark} with their hosts [rather than kill all]{.mark}
possible [hosts]{.mark}]{.underline}.39

The [[U.S. won commitments from **25**]{.mark} **countries** and the
**W**]{.underline}orld **[H]{.underline}**ealth
**[O]{.underline}**rganization [[to]{.mark} work together on systems to
**better [detect and combat]{.mark} outbreaks** of infectious
[diseases]{.mark} such as H7N9]{.underline} avian flu [and
Ebola]{.underline} virus. The [[Obama]{.underline}]{.mark}
administration [[plans to spend **\$40 million**]{.mark} **in 10
countries**]{.underline} this year [[to upgrade lab]{.mark}oratories
[and communications]{.mark} networks [so outbreaks can be
controlled]{.mark} **more [quickly]{.mark}**]{.underline}, Thomas
Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
said today in an interview. President Barack [[Obama will seek another
\$45 million]{.mark} next year]{.underline} to expand the program.
Infectious diseases account for about 1 in 4 deaths worldwide, according
to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. While diseases such as Ebola
and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome haven't posed a threat to the
U.S., lapses in other countries may allow an outbreak to spread rapidly,
Frieden said. "No country can protect itself solely within its borders,"
Frieden said. "[We're all only as safe as the weakest link]{.underline}
out there. [[This]{.mark} is an effort to essentially [make]{.mark}
the]{.underline} **[U.S. safer and make [the world
safer]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [to improve]{.underline}]{.mark}
[countries' [capacity to]{.mark} **better [find, stop and
prevent]{.mark} health [threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}." Frieden and
Kathleen Sebelius, the U.S. health secretary, held a videoconference
today with the partners in the effort. While no other country made a
specific financial commitment today, Frieden said, [all]{.underline} the
[[nations]{.mark} at the conference including China, Russia, France and
the U.K. [agreed to "**accelerate progress**]{.mark} and address not
just the health sector but include security in health [in **new
ways**]{.mark}."]{.underline} First Consensus "**[[For the first
time]{.underline}]{.mark}**, really, [[we have]{.mark} a
[consensus]{.mark} on not only what are the threats, but what do we have
to do to address them,"]{.underline} he said. [As an
example,]{.underline} Frieden said [Turkey]{.underline}'s government
[agreed to host a WHO office to respond to outbreaks in its
region.]{.underline} [The agreement will]{.underline} also [target
**emerging infections** such as]{.underline} **[M]{.underline}**iddle
**[E]{.underline}**ast **[R]{.underline}**espiratory
**[S]{.underline}**yndrome. The 10 countries in line for the U.S.
investment, which will be funded by the CDC and the Department of
Defense, weren't identified. [The [CDC plans to build on test
projects]{.mark}]{.underline} last year in Uganda and Vietnam, [[where
the agency helped]{.underline}]{.mark} the two [nations' health
officials [improve systems to detect]{.mark} and combat outbreaks
of]{.underline} dangerous pathogens that include drug-resistant
[tuberculosis, Ebola]{.underline} virus [and]{.underline} exotic
[flu]{.underline} strains. In Uganda, [CDC officials helped the
country's Ministry of Health upgrade laboratories]{.underline} where
tissue samples would be tested in the event of an outbreak, [and
developed a system for local doctors to report cases of
illness]{.underline} by text message, according to an article published
in the CDC's journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. [[Uganda now
is able to **quickly** transport]{.mark} tissue [samples]{.mark} from
rural outbreaks to a high-security lab]{.underline} in the capital,
Kampala, by motorcycle courier and overnight mail, Frieden said. A
mobile phone network-connected printer then texts lab results back to
rural hospitals, he said. "[Ultimately every country in the world should
have this kind of system," Frieden said. **The \$[40 million]{.mark}, he
said, "[is certainly]{.mark} enough to make [a good
start]{.mark}."**]{.underline}

<http://www.quora.com/Why-dont-diseases-completely-wipe-out-species>

But [mostly [diseases **don\'t drive**]{.mark} **species
[extinct]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There are several reasons for that. For
one, [the most dangerous diseases are those that spread from one
individual to another. If the disease is highly lethal, then the
population drops, and it becomes **less likely that individuals will
contact each other**]{.underline} during the infectious phase.
**[[Highly contagious]{.mark} [diseases]{.mark} tend to [burn]{.mark}
themselves [out]{.mark}]{.underline}** that way. Probably [the main
reason is variation. Within the host and the pathogen
population]{.underline} there will be a wide range of variants.
[[Some]{.mark} hosts [may be naturally resistant]{.mark}. Some
pathogens]{.underline} will be [less virulent]{.underline}. And [either
alone or in combination, **[you end up with infected]{.mark} individuals
[who survive]{.mark}**. We see this in HIV]{.underline}, for example.
[There is a small fraction]{.underline} of humans who are [naturally
resistant or]{.underline} [altogether immune]{.underline} to HIV, either
because of their CCR5 allele or their MHC Class I type. [And there are
[a handful]{.mark} of people who were infected]{.underline} with
defective versions of HIV [**that [didn\'t progress]{.mark}** to
disease]{.underline}. [We can see]{.underline} indications of
[this]{.underline} sort of thing happening [in the past, because our
genomes contain **many instances** of pathogen [resistance]{.mark} genes
that have [spread through the]{.mark} whole
[population]{.mark}.]{.underline} Those all started off as rare
mutations that conferred a strong selection advantage to the carriers,
meaning that the specific infectious diseases were serious threats to
the species.

That leaves pandemics and cobalt bombs, which will get a longer
discussion. [While there is little published work on [human
extinction]{.mark} risk [from pandemics]{.mark}, it seems that **it
[would be extremely challenging]{.mark} for any
pandemic**]{.underline}---[whether **natural or**]{.underline}
man[made]{.underline}---[to leave the people in a specially constructed
refuge as the **sole survivors**]{.underline}. In his introductory book
on pandemics ([Doherty]{.underline}, 2013, p. 197) [argues]{.underline}:
"[**[No pandemic is likely to wipe out]{.mark} the [human
s]{.mark}pecies.** [Even without]{.mark} the protection provided by
[modern science, we survived]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[smallpox, TB,

[back [when human numbers were **very small**]{.mark}, infections may
have been responsible for some]{.underline} of the **[genetic

there is **no formal proof**]{.underline} of this." [Though some
[authors]{.mark} have **vividly [described worst-case
scenarios]{.mark}**]{.underline} for engineered pandemics (e.g. Rees,
2003 and Posner, 2004; and Myhrvold, 2013), [[it would take a **special
effort** to infect]{.mark} people in [**highly isolated locations**,
especially]{.mark} the [100+]{.mark} **"largely [uncontacted"
peoples]{.mark} who prefer to be left alone.**]{.underline} This is not
to say it would be impossible. A madman intent on annihilating all human
life could use cropduster-style delivery systems, flying over isolated
peoples and infecting them. Or perhaps a pandemic could be engineered to
be delivered through animal or environmental vectors that would reach
all of these people

A [new]{.underline} set of journal [articles related to]{.underline} the
10th anniversary of the [[SARS]{.underline}]{.mark} epidemic in 2003
[says the episode **[did much to boost recognition]{.mark}** of the need
for coordinated]{.underline} international and national [responses
to]{.underline} emerging infectious [diseases]{.underline}. The articles
and commentaries in Emerging Infectious Diseases reflect on the effects
of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), which arose in China in
late 2002 and spread to more than 30 countries in early 2003, sickening
about 8,000 people and killing around 800. The outbreak was first
publicized by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Mar 12, 2003. Among
the reports is one describing two new SARS-like coronaviruses---close
relatives of the SARS coronavirus---found in bats in China. The new
viruses are more distant relatives of the novel human coronavirus that
has caused illnesses in 17 people, with 11 deaths, in the past year. All
of the cases had connections to the Middle East.
[Publication]{.underline} of the articles [comes as the world is
contending with still another emerging pathogen,]{.underline} the novel
[H7N9 influenza]{.underline} virus in China, which has infected at least
64 people and killed 14 in recent weeks. Surveillance and response In a
\"synopsis\" piece, a team led by Christopher R. [Braden]{.underline},
MD, of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [reports
on **progress** in global surveillance and response
capacity]{.underline} in the 10 years since SARS emerged. [They review
the milestones of the epidemic,]{.underline} from its silent emergence
in southern China in November 2002 to its spread to Hong Kong and,
boosted by a \"superspreader,\" from there to many other countries. They
[say the [SARS]{.mark} epidemic **[powerfully stimulated international
cooperation]{.mark}** to fight emerging diseases.]{.underline} \"Perhaps
[the **[most important legacy]{.mark}** of SARS [is]{.mark} the
[recognition of the critical need for]{.mark} a [multilateral
response]{.mark}, led by WHO]{.underline}, in the event of a rapidly
moving but ultimately containable global epidemic,\" they write. \"[The
[central role of WHO]{.mark}]{.underline} [in coordinating the
laboratory network]{.underline} that identified the etiologic agent and
shared reagents, the [epidemiology network]{.underline} that
characterized the spread and identified the most effective control
measures, [and the policy]{.underline} and communications network that
incorporated rapidly changing knowledge into measured travel advisories
[[was **critical for**]{.mark} **the [control]{.mark} of the epidemic
and a credit to WHO.**\"]{.underline} The [[SARS]{.underline}]{.mark}
epidemic dramatically reduced global travel and business, showing how
disruptive a new pathogen could be, Braden and colleagues observe. Those
effects [[stimulated]{.mark} pandemic flu [planning]{.mark} and
surveillance, a greater [focus on]{.mark} global [health]{.mark}
security, and improved [laboratory and surveillance networks.
**Further**]{.mark}, the [episode **spurred efforts**]{.mark} to update
the International Health Regulations, [which had not been revised since
1969]{.mark}]{.underline}, the article says. The regulations took effect
in 2007. However, fewer than 20% of the 194 WHO countries that accepted
the regulations had complied with their core requirements by the June
2012 deadline, according to Braden and colleagues. **[[Another
effect]{.underline}]{.mark}** of SARS [[was]{.mark} to spur the
establishment of [new]{.mark} national public health [agencies]{.mark}
in Canada]{.underline} (the Public Health Agency of Canada, or PHAC)
[and the United Kingdom]{.underline} (the Health Protection Agency), the
authors say. In a related perspective article, a team led by Jeffrey P.
[Koplan]{.underline}, MD, MPH, of Emory University, a former CDC
director, [says the value of national public health institutes **was one
of the major lessons**]{.underline} of SARS. Koplan is joined by authors
from the PHAC and its counterparts in Hong Kong and China. They note
that more than [**[80]{.mark}** national public health [institutes are
now linked]{.mark} through the International Association of National
Public Health Institutes]{.underline}, which promotes the establishment
of new institutes and helps strengthen existing ones.

A new report on the economic impact of the
United-States-Mexico-Canada-Trade Agreement may not be sufficient enough
to sway Democratic lawmaker reservations.

The [[I]{.mark}nternational [T]{.mark}rade [C]{.mark}ommission
report]{.underline} released Thursday [[found that the USMCA]{.mark}
that President Trump reached with this Canadian and Mexican counterparts
[would increase U.S. GDP by a slim margin]{.mark} of \$68.2 billion, or
0.35%.]{.underline}

The ITC was required to prepare the report per the Bipartisan
Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 which
mandates that the Commission provide lawmakers with a detailed report of
a trade deal before they vote on it.

"[This report confirms what has been clear since this deal was
announced - Donald Trump's [NAFTA represents at best a minor update to
NAFTA, which will only offer limited benefits to U.S.
workers,]{.mark}"]{.underline} said Sen. Ron Wyden in a statement. The

Despite backsliding in some areas and missed opportunities in others,
the USMCA isn't all bad. Most goods trade will continue to be
tariff-free (the NAFTA status quo) under the new agreement, and barriers
to certain agricultural products will be reduced, as well. The agreement
establishes needed new rules in the realm of digital trade, including
prohibitions of data transmission taxes and data localization
requirements.

[The [USMCA is a marginal improvement over NAFTA---]{.mark}better in
some areas, worse in others, [about the same]{.mark} in most. Relative
to the existing NAFTA, [there are pros and cons]{.mark}. Though there is
greater liberalization in goods trade, it is marginally to imperceptibly
so. [Taking into consideration the negative changes, especially to the
rules of origin, it's not obvious that USMCA is much of an
upgrade]{.mark} from NAFTA]{.underline}. But it's possible---even
probable---that some of the less directly liberalizing, technical and
procedural provisions, such as those governing "Digital Trade," "Customs
and Trade Facilitation," "State-Owned Enterprises" and others, utilized
in ways not completely apparent now, could lead to lower trade costs
down the road.

What happens when America's deal-maker-in-chief takes on "the worst
trade deal in the history of the world"? Not much, it turns out.

That's the conclusion drawn by an independent government agency in a new
report (pdf) estimating the economic impact of the US-Mexico-Canada
Agreement, as Donald Trump's renegotiated version of the 1997 North
American Free Trade Agreement is officially known. Written by US
International Trade Commission economists, the report was legally
required before Congress votes on the deal. If approved, [[the law would
boost the US economy by less than 0.4%,]{.mark} accounting for
inflation]{.underline}. About \$68 billion.

But [[it]{.mark} very plausibly [could hurt]{.mark} the US economy [more
than it helps]{.mark}]{.underline}.

There are good reasons to think the report's prediction of a 0.4% GDP
increase and a net increase of about 176,000 jobs overstates the likely
impact of the USMCA. [[Those calculations]{.mark}---and the conclusion
[that]{.mark} the new [trade deal will benefit]{.mark} the American
economy---[rest on one big assumption]{.mark} the report's authors
made]{.underline}, Chad Bown, an expert on trade at the Peterson
Institute for International Economics.

To understand what he means, it helps to break down the two main
scenarios the report's authors modeled. Let's start with the most
concrete of these---[[the estimated impact of the law if you don't make
the]{.mark} iffy [assumption]{.mark} Bown mentions.]{.underline}

The default scenario: not so sunny

The key question the ITC report strives to answer is: How would the
changes that Trump's new deal makes to trade and investment barriers
increase or decrease US output, employment, and wages?

The authors' base case---what we'll call the "default scenario"---models
known barriers---tariffs, quotas, and labor regulations, for instance.

[They find that the [USMCA will cause the American economy to
shrink]{.mark} a wee bit, say the authors---[by]{.mark} about [\$23
billion. It will also drive down wages]{.mark} a tad [and put nearly
54,000 people out of work]{.mark}. In other words, American c[ompanies,
workers, and consumers]{.mark} as a whole [will be]{.mark} slightly
[better off if the USMCA doesn't pass]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Most media coverage of the report didn't mention these findings at
all---instead reporting only a slight boost in output, employment, and
wages. (That's not surprising, exactly. The report is 375 pages long.
The first mention of these more sobering results is on page 56.)

What is it about the USMCA that will cause this small hit to the
American economy?

[The biggest change is created by its new "rules of origin requirements"
for the auto industry. If passed, the [USMCA would force]{.mark} US
[automakers to buy more]{.mark} of their parts [from domestic part
makers]{.mark}. That would, on balance, help workers and firms in
auto-parts manufacturing. But those gains wouldn't come from increased
trade (which, all else equal, makes things cheaper). Instead, they'd be
due to US consumers having to pay more for domestic-made autos. And
[that would reduce auto production, since higher prices would curb
demand for American-made cars.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[So in the authors' default scenario, [the economy as a whole would be
worse off]{.mark}]{.underline}. Here's the breakdown of those numbers,
as reported on page 57 of the report1.

The U.S. market is generally open to foreign investment already, but
investment restrictions persist in certain industries, including
financial services, commercial air services, communications, and
mining[. The [USMCA provides no]{.mark} significant [new access to
foreign investors]{.mark} in the United States]{.underline}.

Likewise, [the [USMCA does]{.mark} close to [nothing to open any]{.mark}
wider U.S. government [procurement spending to bids from Canadian and
Mexican companies]{.mark}]{.underline}. That's a huge missed opportunity
because [[under the various "Buy American" provisions, foreign]{.mark}
firms and foreign [products are limited in competing for]{.mark} the
estimated \$1.7 trillion of annual U.S. federal and state government
[procurement spending.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[This,]{.mark} of course,
[drives up the cost]{.mark} of every government project [and ensures
that taxpayers get the smallest bang for their
buck]{.mark}]{.underline}. In light of the president's interest in
advancing a major infrastructure bill---maybe in the neighborhood of \$1
trillion---this is a problem that should concern us all.

#### USMCA will hurt the economy

Jeffrey J. **Schott**, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for
International Economics. He is an Economist, **7-16**-2019, \"Just Say
No to the New Nafta,\" Bloomberg,

(Vik)

President Donald Trump claims he has "tremendous Democrat support" in
the House for the accord he signed last year with Mexico and Canada to
replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. He threatens to
withdraw from Nafta if Congress doesn't quickly pass his new trade deal.

House Speaker Nancy [Pelosi wants the deal, now called the United
States-Mexico-Canada agreement, improved before Congress votes on
it,]{.underline} with stronger labor and environmental protections,
among other changes, even though some Democrats are willing to support
the deal as is.

Pelosi's instinct is right[: Congress should call the president's bluff
and just say no to the [USMCA]{.mark}.]{.underline} Compared with
current policies, **[the new accord [would restrict trade and
investment, impose costs on consumers, and undercut U.S. economic
growth]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Rejecting it now can lead to a better
deal with Mexico and Canada.

The main flaw is that the [[USMCA imposes costly]{.mark} regulatory
[mandates that would disrupt]{.mark} North American [trade and
investment]{.mark}, particularly in the auto sector]{.underline}. [It
also restricts bidding on government contracts and includes a "sunset"
clause that requires review of the agreement every six years and
provides for its possible termination in 16 years. These conditions will
constrain investment and growth.]{.underline}

Some supporters of the deal say it provides new rules that will benefit
the U.S. But those "new" rules aren't new. Rather they mirror provisions
affecting labor, the environment and e-commerce from the revised
Trans-Pacific Partnership that have been carried out by Mexico and
Canada since that accord went into effect on Dec. 30, 2018. Trump
withdrew from the TPP, but Canada and Mexico remained in it, and already
apply these provisions in trade relations with the U.S.

The administration's claim that the USMCA will boost economic activity
is based on a study by the United States International Trade Commission,
which estimated the pact would increase U.S. growth by 0.3 percent of
GDP per year. But in fact the study says that on balance the market
access provisions of [[the accord would restrict trade and cause U.S.
growth to decline by 0.12 percent]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The positive overall result touted by American officials is based on a
separate estimation that USMCA rules in areas like intellectual property
and digital trade will reduce uncertainty and encourage investment and
growth. But those gains result from Mexico and Canada's participation in
the revised TPP; US firms already get those benefits without the USMCA.

Moreover, the commission's study failed to account for the greater
uncertainty caused by the sunset clause, not to mention the cost of
Trump's threats to raise tariffs on Mexico unilaterally over immigration
issues. Overall, **[the [USMCA]{.mark} [would increase uncertainty for
traders and investors]{.mark} alike [and have a negative impact on
growth]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

The costly regulatory [[mandates]{.mark} imposed by the USMCA are in the
form of]{.underline} requirements [that high percentages of goods must
be made in North America in order to get U.S. trade
preferences.]{.underline} The administration claims these "rules of
origin" would yield new investment in U.S. production and increase the
nation's auto sector jobs by 7.6 percent.

But the trade commission study refutes that claim. It estimates that
[these very rules [would increase]{.mark} U.S. and Mexican [production
costs]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In the U.S., the rules would reduce
output and increase imports from outside North America, while raising
the average price of vehicles, factors that would cut auto sales. Simply
put, **[[USMCA]{.mark} auto [rules]{.mark} would [hurt auto firms and
workers.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Automakers in the U.S. opposed these rules during the trade negotiations
but they are now going along with them out of fear that Trump will make
things even worse by pulling out of Nafta. It is debatable if the
president has the legal authority to do that. In any case, abrogating
Nafta without a replacement would devastate the auto industry in states
Trump needs to win in 2020, including Texas.

House Democrats can easily afford to call his bluff.

A better approach for Congress would be to defer consideration of
legislation until U.S. trade officials fix what's wrong with the pact,
starting with consumer protections in pharmaceuticals and stronger
enforcement of labor and environmental provisions. Importantly,
revisions should also scale back the damaging auto provisions exposed by
the U.S. International Trade Commission study. And the Democrats should
insist that the pact cover climate change issues, a glaring omission in
the version Trump signed.

Trump may not go along with this path. But there's little economic cost
in deferring action and planning how the USMCA can be properly fixed in
the post-Trump era. The USMCA requires more than cosmetic changes. It's
time for Congress to set that process in motion.

### 2ac -- econ no war

#### Economy is resilient and slight bumps don't escalate 

Martin **Wolf,** 1-5-**16** ---Financial Times Martin,

"Why **[[global economic disaster is]{.underline}]{.mark}** an
**[[unlikely]{.underline}]{.mark}** event"

Measured at purchasing power parity, [[the]{.mark} world [economy has
**grown**]{.mark} **in [every year since 1946]{.mark}**[,
even]{.mark}]{.underline} (albeit barely) in 2009[, [in the wake
of]{.underline}]{.mark} [the global financial
[crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The period between 1900 and 1946
was more unstable than the era of managed capitalism that succeeded it.
Even so, the world economy grew in all but nine of those years.

[The [innovation]{.mark}-driven economy that]{.underline} emerged in the
late 18th and 19th centuries and [spread across the globe]{.underline}
in the 20th and 21st [**[just grows]{.underline}**.]{.mark} That is the
most important fact about it. [It does not grow across the world at all
evenly]{.underline} --- far from it. It does not share its benefits
among people at all equally --- again, far from it. [**But it grows**.
It grew last year]{.underline}. Much the most plausible assumption is
that [it will grow again this year.]{.underline}

[The world economy will not grow forever. But [it will **only stop**
when]{.mark}]{.underline} the economics of Thomas Malthus overwhelm
those of Joseph Schumpeter --- that is, when [[resource constraints
offset innovation. **We are certainly not there
yet**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Since 1900, the world's output has grown at a rate of just over 3 per
cent a year. Such is the power of compound interest that world output
has expanded more than 30-fold over this period. Output grew relatively
slowly in the early part of the 20th century and relatively fast between
1947 and the early 1970s. Intriguingly, it grew a bit faster under
postwar Keynesian economics than under the conservative revival launched
by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan in the 1980s.

Now consider the pattern of volatility. The marked volatility between
1914 and 1919 was due to the first world war; that of the 1930s to the
Great Depression; and that of the 1940s to the second world war. The
instability of the 1970s and early 1980s was due to the oil shocks,
triggered (or augmented) by war (the Yom Kippur war of 1973 and Iraq's
1980 invasion of Iran). Inflationary financing of the Vietnam war
generated the inflationary backdrop to the instability. Ultimately, that
led to disinflation by the Federal Reserve, under Paul Volcker.

The slowdown in 1990 and 1991 was again due to disinflation and the
first Gulf war, which followed Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. The
slowdown in 1998 was triggered by the Asian financial crisis, that in
2001 by the bursting of a huge stock market bubble and that in 2009 by
the western financial crisis.

This picture of the past indicates the kind of events one should worry
about. In brief, there seem to be three: wars; inflation shocks (perhaps
linked to wars or jumps in commodity prices); and financial crises.
These phenomena can be linked: wars will trigger inflation if their
finance is by inflationary means.

In this light, let us consider current risks. Some analysts have been
convinced for years that high inflation must result from the expansion
of central-bank balance sheets. They are wrong. It is quite possible for
central banks to control the effects of their policies upon the
expansion in credit and money.

[A second set of risks]{.underline}, again ceaselessly promoted, [is
that of financial crisis. [The biggest risks seem to be]{.mark} in
[emerging economies. But these risks are **likely to be contained** or
**prove manageable at the global level**. If]{.mark} the [worst came
to]{.mark} the [worst, the results are **likely** to be more
like]{.mark} those of [**1998** than]{.mark} of
**[2009]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[Do economic downturns generate pressure for diversionary

that view each other as military threats, the biggest step possible
toward bilateral cooperation is to terminate the rivalry by taking
political steps to manage the competition. [Drawing on data from **109
distinct rival dyads** since 1950, **67 of which terminated,** the
[evidence suggests rivalries were]{.mark} approximately **[twice as
likely to terminate during]{.mark} economic
[downturns]{.mark}**]{.underline} than they were during periods of
economic normalcy. [This is true [controlling for]{.mark} **all of the

"The New Rules: Security Remains Stable Amid Financial Crisis", Asset
Protection Network, 8-25,

[When the]{.underline} global [financial crisis struck]{.underline}
roughly a year ago, [the blogosphere was ablaze with]{.underline} all
sorts of [scary predictions of]{.underline}, and commentary regarding,
[ensuing]{.underline} conflict and [wars \-- a rerun of the Great
Depression leading to world war]{.underline}, as it were. Now, as global
economic news brightens and recovery \-- surprisingly led by China and
emerging markets \-- is the talk of the day, it\'s interesting to look
back over the past year and realize how globalization\'s first truly
[[worldwide recession has had **virtually no impact**]{.mark} whatsoever
[on]{.mark} the [international security]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}landscape. [[No]{.mark}ne of the]{.underline} more than
three-dozen [[ongoing conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark} listed by
GlobalSecurity.org [[can be]{.underline}]{.mark} clearly [[attributed to
the]{.mark} global [recession]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [the last
new entry]{.underline} (civil conflict between Hamas and Fatah
[in]{.underline} the [Palestine)]{.underline} [**predates** the economic
crisis]{.underline} by a year, and three quarters of the chronic
struggles began in the last century. Ditto for the 15 low-intensity
conflicts listed by Wikipedia (where the latest entry is the Mexican
\"drug war\" begun in 2006). Certainly, the Russia-Georgia conflict last
August was specifically timed, but by most accounts the opening ceremony
of the Beijing Olympics was the most important external trigger
(followed by the U.S. presidential campaign) for that sudden spike in an
almost two-decade long struggle between Georgia and its two breakaway
regions. Looking over the various databases, then, we see a most
familiar picture: the usual mix of civil conflicts, insurgencies, and
liberation-themed terrorist movements. [Besides]{.underline} the recent
[Russia-Georgia]{.underline} dust-up, [[the only]{.underline}]{.mark}
two potential [state-on-state [wars]{.mark} (North v. South Korea,
Israel v. Iran) [are]{.mark}]{.underline} both tied to one side
acquiring a nuclear weapon capacity \-- a process [[**wholly unrelated**
to]{.mark} global [economic trends]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [with the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
effectively [tied down by]{.underline} its two ongoing major
interventions (Iraq and
[Afghanistan-]{.underline}bleeding-into-Pakistan), our
[[involvement]{.mark} elsewhere]{.underline} around the planet [[has
been]{.mark} quite **[modest]{.mark}**]{.underline}, both leading up to
and following the onset of the economic crisis: e.g., the usual
counter-drug efforts in Latin America, the usual military exercises with
allies across Asia, mixing it up with pirates off Somalia\'s coast).
[[Everywhere]{.mark} else [we find]{.mark} serious [instability
we]{.mark}]{.underline} pretty much **[[let it
burn]{.underline}]{.mark}**, occasionally pressing the Chinese \--
unsuccessfully \-- to do something. Our new Africa Command, for example,
hasn\'t led us to anything beyond advising and training local forces.
So, [[to sum up]{.mark}: No significant uptick in]{.underline} mass
[violence or unrest]{.underline} (remember the smattering of urban riots
last year in places like Greece, Moldova and Latvia?); The usual
frequency maintained in civil conflicts (in all the usual places);
[[**Not a single state-on-state war directly caused** (and no
great-power]{.mark}-on-great-power [crises]{.mark} even
[triggered]{.mark}); No]{.underline} great improvement or [disruption
in]{.underline} great-power [cooperation regarding]{.underline} the
emergence of new [nuclear powers]{.underline} (despite all that
diplomacy); A modest scaling back of international policing efforts by
the system\'s acknowledged Leviathan power (inevitable given the
strain); and No serious efforts by any rising great power to challenge
that Leviathan or supplant its role. (The worst things we can cite are
Moscow\'s occasional deployments of strategic assets to the Western
hemisphere and its weak efforts to outbid the United States on basing
rights in Kyrgyzstan; but the best include China and India stepping up
their aid and investments in Afghanistan and Iraq.) Sure, we\'ve finally
seen global defense spending surpass the previous world record set in
the late 1980s, but even that\'s likely to wane given the stress on
public budgets created by all this unprecedented \"stimulus\" spending.
If anything, the friendly cooperation on such stimulus packaging was the
most notable great-power dynamic caused by the crisis. [Can we
say]{.underline} that [the world has suffered a]{.underline} distinct
[shift to]{.underline} political [radicalism]{.underline} as a result of
the economic crisis? Indeed, [no. The]{.underline} world\'s [major
economies remain]{.underline} governed by [center-left]{.underline} or
center-right political factions that remain decidedly friendly to both
markets and trade. [In the short run, there were]{.underline} attempts
across the board to insulate economies from immediate damage (in effect,
as much [protectionism]{.underline} as allowed under current trade
rules), [but]{.underline} there was [[no]{.mark} great [slide into
\"trade wars.\"]{.mark}]{.underline} Instead, [[the
**W**]{.underline}]{.mark}orld **[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**rade
**[[O]{.underline}]{.mark}**rganization [[is
functioning]{.underline}]{.mark} as it was designed to function, and
regional efforts toward free-trade agreements have not slowed. Can we
say [Islamic [radicalism]{.mark}]{.underline} was inflamed by the
economic crisis? If it was, that shift [[was clearly overwhelmed
by]{.underline}]{.mark} the Islamic world\'s growing [[disenchantment
with]{.underline}]{.mark} the brutality displayed by violent extremist
groups such as [[al-Qaida]{.underline}]{.mark}. And looking forward,
austere economic times are just as likely to breed connecting
evangelicalism as disconnecting fundamentalism. At the end of the day,
the economic crisis did not prove to be sufficiently frightening to
provoke major economies into establishing global regulatory schemes,
even as it has sparked a spirited \-- and much needed, as I argued last
week \-- discussion of the continuing viability of the U.S. dollar as
the world\'s primary reserve currency. Naturally, plenty of experts and
pundits have attached great significance to this debate, seeing in it
the beginning of \"economic warfare\" and the like between \"fading\"
America and \"rising\" China. And yet, in a world of globally integrated
production chains and interconnected financial markets, such \"diverging
interests\" hardly constitute signposts for wars up ahead. Frankly, I
don\'t welcome a world in which America\'s fiscal profligacy goes
undisciplined, so bring it on \-- please! Add it all up and it\'s fair
to say that this global financial crisis has proven the great resilience
of America\'s post-World War II international liberal trade order. Do I
expect to read any analyses along those lines in the blogosphere any
time soon? Absolutely not. I [[expect]{.mark} the [**fantastic
fear-mongering** to proceed]{.mark}]{.underline} apace. [[That\'s what
the Internet is for]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### No resources mean no war

**Bennett 2K** \-\-\-- D. Scott and Timothy Nordstrom, Professors of
Political Science (Penn State), "Foreign Policy Substitutability and
Internal Economic Problems in Enduring Rivalries," February, Journal of
Conflict Resolution

In this analysis**[,]{.underline}** [we focus on using economic
conditions to understand when rivalries are likely to escalate or
end]{.underline}. Rivalries are an appropriate set of cases to use when
examining substitutability both because leaders in rival states have
clearly substitutable choices and because rivalries are a set of cases
in which externalization is a particularly plausible policy option.7 In
particular, [when confronted [with domestic problems,
leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} in a rivalry [[have]{.mark} the clear
[alternatives of escalating]{.mark} the conflict]{.underline} with the
rival [[to divert]{.underline}]{.mark} attention
[[or]{.mark}]{.underline} to work to [[settle]{.mark}]{.underline} the
rivalry [[as a means of freeing up]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[substantial]{.underline} amount of [[resources]{.mark} that can be
directed [to]{.mark}ward solving [internal
problems]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In the case of the diversion
option, rivals provide logical, believable actors for leaders to target;
the presence of a clear rival may offer unstable elites a particularly
inviting target for hostile statements or actual conflict as necessary.
The public and relevant elites already consider the rival a threat or
else the rivalry would not have continued for an extended period; the
presence of disputed issues also provides a casus belli with the rival
that is always present. Rivals also may provide a target where the
possible costs and risks of externalization are relatively controlled.
If the goal is diversion, leaders willwant to divert attention without
provoking an actual (and expensive)war. Over the course of many
confrontations, rival states may learn to anticipate response patterns,
leading to safer disputes or at least to leaders believing that they can
control the risks of conflict when they initiate a new confrontation. In
sum, rivals provide good targets for domestically challenged political
leaders. This leads to our first hypothesis, which is as follows:
*Hypothesis 1*: Poor economic conditions lead to diversionary actions
against the rival. [Conflict [settlement is]{.mark}]{.underline} also
[[a distinct route]{.mark} to dealing with internal problems that
leaders in rivalries may pursue [when faced with]{.mark} internal
[problems]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Military
[competition]{.mark}]{.underline} between states [[requires]{.mark}
large amounts of [resources]{.mark}]{.underline}, and rivals require
even more attention. [Leaders may choose to negotiate a settlement that
ends a rivalry to free up important resources]{.underline} that may be
reallocated to the domestic economy. [[In]{.mark} a "guns versus butter"
world of economic [trade-offs, when a state can no longer]{.mark} afford
to [pay]{.mark} the expenses associated with competition in a rivalry,
[it is]{.mark} quite [rational]{.mark} for leaders [to]{.mark} reduce
costs by [end]{.mark}ing [a rivalry]{.mark}. This gain]{.underline} (a
peace dividend) [could be achieved at any time]{.underline} by ending a
rivalry. [However, [such]{.mark} a gain [is likely]{.mark} to be most
important and attractive to leaders [when internal conditions are
bad]{.mark} and the leader is seeking ways to alleviate active problems.
[Support]{.mark} for policy change away from continued rivalry
[is]{.mark} more [likely to develop when]{.mark} the [economic situation
sours]{.mark} and elites and masses are looking for ways to improve a
worsening situation. It is at these times that [the pressure to
cut]{.mark} military investment [will be grea]{.mark}test and that state
leaders will be forced to recognize the difficulty of continuing to pay
for a rivalry]{.underline}. Among other things, this argument also
encompasses the view that the cold war ended because the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics could no longer compete economically with the United
States. *Hypothesis 2*: [Poor economic conditions increase the
probability of rivalry termination**.**]{.underline} Hypotheses 1 and 2
posit opposite behaviors in response to a single cause (internal
economic problems). As such, they demand a research design that can
account for substitutability between them.

One year ago, the world seemed as if it might be coming apart. The
global financial system, which had fueled a great expansion of
capitalism and trade across the world, was crumbling. All the
certainties of the age of -globalization\--about the virtues of free
markets, trade, and technology\--were being called into question. Faith
in the American model had collapsed. The financial industry had
crumbled. Once-roaring emerging markets like China, India, and Brazil
were sinking. Worldwide trade was shrinking to a degree not seen since
the 1930s. Pundits whose bearishness had been vindicated predicted we
were doomed to a long, painful bust, with cascading failures in sector
after sector, country after country. In a widely cited essay that
appeared in The Atlantic this May, Simon Johnson, former chief economist
of the International Monetary Fund, wrote: \"The conventional wisdom
among the elite is still that the current slump \'cannot be as bad as
the Great Depression.\' This view is wrong. What we face now could, in
fact, be worse than the Great Depression.\" Others predicted that these
economic shocks would lead to political instability and violence in the
worst-hit countries. At his confirmation hearing in February, the new
U.S. director of national intelligence, Adm. Dennis Blair, cautioned the
Senate that \"the financial crisis and global recession are likely to
produce a wave of economic crises in emerging-market nations over the
next year.\" Hillary Clinton endorsed this grim view. And she was hardly
alone. Foreign Policy ran a cover story predicting serious unrest in
several emerging markets. Of one thing everyone was sure: nothing would
ever be the same again. Not the financial industry, not capitalism, not
globalization. One year later, how much has the world really changed?
Well, Wall Street is home to two fewer investment banks (three, if you
count Merrill Lynch). Some regional banks have gone bust. There was some
turmoil in Moldova and (entirely unrelated to the financial crisis) in
Iran. Severe problems remain, like high unemployment in the West, and we
face new problems caused by responses to the crisis\--soaring debt and
fears of inflation. But [overall, things look nothing like they did in
the]{.underline} 19[**30s**. The [predictions of economic]{.mark} and
political [collapse have **not materialized**]{.mark} at all. A key
measure]{.underline} of fear and fragility [is the ability of
poor]{.underline} and unstable [countries to borrow money]{.underline}
on the debt markets. [So consider this: the]{.underline} sovereign
[bonds of]{.underline} tottering [Pakistan have returned 168
percent]{.underline} so far [this year]{.underline}. All
[this]{.underline} doesn\'t add up to a recovery yet, but it [does
reflect a return to]{.underline} some level of [normalcy]{.underline}.
And [that rebound has been]{.underline} so [rapid]{.underline} that even
the shrewdest observers remain puzzled. \"The question I have at the
back of my head is \'Is that it?\' \" says Charles Kaye, the co-head of
Warburg Pincus. \"We had this huge crisis, and now we\'re back to
business as usual?\" This revival did not happen because markets managed
to stabilize themselves on their own. Rather, [[governments]{.mark},
having learned the lessons of the Great Depression, were determined not
to repeat the same mistakes]{.underline} once this crisis hit. [By
[massively expanding]{.mark} state [support]{.mark}]{.underline} for the
economy\--[through central banks and national treasuries\--they
[**buffered** the worst]{.mark} of the [damage]{.mark}]{.underline}.
(Whether they made new mistakes in the process remains to be seen.) The
[extensive [social safety nets]{.mark}]{.underline} that have been
established across the industrialized world also [[cushioned]{.mark} the
pain]{.underline} felt by many. [Times are]{.underline} still [tough,
but things are nowhere near as bad as in the]{.underline}
19**[30s]{.underline}**, when governments played a tiny role in national
economies. It\'s true that the massive state interventions of the past
year may be fueling some new bubbles: the cheap cash and government
guarantees provided to banks, companies, and consumers have fueled some
irrational exuberance in stock and bond markets. Yet these
[rallies]{.underline} also [demonstrate the return of confidence, and
confidence is a very powerful economic force]{.underline}. When John
Maynard Keynes described his own prescriptions for economic growth, he
believed government action could provide only a temporary fix until the
real motor of the economy started cranking again\--the animal spirits of
investors, consumers, and companies seeking risk and profit. Beyond all
this, though, I believe [there\'s a fundamental reason why we have not
faced global collapse in the last year. It is the same reason that [we
weathered the]{.mark} stock-market [crash of]{.mark}]{.underline}
19[**[87]{.mark}**, the [recession of]{.mark}]{.underline}
19[**[92]{.mark}**, the [Asian crisis]{.mark} of]{.underline} 19[**97**,
the [Russian default]{.mark} of]{.underline} 19[**98**, [and]{.mark} the
[tech-bubble collapse]{.mark} of]{.underline} 20[**00**.
[The]{.mark}]{.underline} current [[global economic system is
**inherently**]{.mark} **more [resilient]{.mark}** than we think. The
world today is [characterized by]{.mark}]{.underline} three [[major
forces for stability]{.mark}, each [reinforcing the
other]{.mark}]{.underline} and each historical in nature.

#### 2008 crushes their impact

**Drezner, 12** (Professor International Politics Tufts University, '12
(Daniel, October, "The Irony of Global Economic Governance: The System
Worked" Council on Foreign Relations International Institutions and
Global Governance)

In looking at outcomes, [the obvious question is [how well the]{.mark}
global [economy]{.mark} has recovered from the 20[08]{.mark}
crisis]{.underline}. The current literature on economic downturns
suggests two factors that impose significant barriers to a strong
recovery from the Great Recession: [it was triggered by a financial
crisis and it was global in scope]{.underline}. Whether measuring
output, per capita income, or employment, [financial crashes trigger
downturns that last longer]{.underline} and have far weaker recoveries
than standard business cycle downturns.10 Furthermore, [the global
nature of the crisis makes it extremely difficult for countries to
export their way out of the problem]{.underline}. Countries that have
experienced severe banking crises since World War II have usually done
so when the global economy was largely unaffected. That was not the case
for the Great Recession. [The global economy has rebounded much better
than during the Great Depression]{.underline}. Economists Barry
Eichengreen and Kevin O'Rourke have compiled data to compare global
economic performance from the start of the crises (see Figures 1 and
2).11 Two facts stand out in their comparisons. First, [the percentage
drop in global industrial output and world trade levels at the start of
the 2008 financial crisis was more precipitous than the falloffs
following the October 1929 stock market crash]{.underline}. The drop in
industrial output was greater in 2008 nine months into the crisis than
it was eighty years earlier after the same amount of time. The drop in
trade flows was more than twice as large. Second, the post-2008 rebound
has been far more robust. Four years after the onset of the Great
Recession, [global industrial output is 10 percent higher than when the
recession began]{.underline}. In contrast, [four years after the 1929
stock market crash, industrial output was at only two-thirds of
precrisis levels.]{.underline} A similar story can be told with
aggregate economic growth. According to World Bank figures, [global
economic output rebounded in 2010 with 2.3 percent growth]{.underline},
followed up in 2011 with 4.2 percent growth. The global growth rate in
2011 was 44 percent higher than the average of the previous decade. Even
more intriguing, the growth continued to be poverty reducing.12 The
World Bank's latest figures suggest that despite the 2008 financial
crisis, extreme poverty continued to decline across all the major
regions of the globe. And the developing world achieved its first
Millennium Development Goal of halving the 1990 levels of extreme
poverty.13 An important reason for the quick return to positive economic
growth is that [cross-border flows did not dry up after the 2008
crisis]{.underline}. Again, compared to the Great Depression, [trade
flows have rebounded extremely well]{.underline}.14 Four years after the
1929 stock market crash, trade flows were off by 25 percent compared to
precrisis levels. Current trade flows, in contrast, are more than 5
percent higher than in 2008. Even compared to other postwar recessions,
the current period has seen robust crossborder exchange. Indeed, as a
report from CFR's Maurice R. Greenberg Center for Geoeconomic Studies
concluded in May 2012, "[The [growth]{.mark} in world trade
[since]{.mark} the start of [the]{.mark} \[current\] [recovery]{.mark}
[exceeds]{.mark} [even the best]{.mark} of the [prior]{.mark} postwar
[experiences]{.mark}]{.underline}."15 Other cross-border flows have also
rebounded from 2008--2009 lows. Global foreign direct investment (FDI)
has returned to robust levels. FDI inflows rose by 17 percent in 2011
alone. This put annual FDI levels at \$1.5 trillion, surpassing the
three-year precrisis average, though still approximately 25 percent
below the 2007 peak. More generally, global foreign investment assets
reached \$96 trillion, a 5 percent increase from precrisis highs.
Remittances from migrant workers have become an increasingly important
revenue stream to the developing world---and the 2008 financial crisis
did not dampen that income stream. Cross-border remittances to
developing countries quickly rebounded to precrisis levels and then rose
to an estimated all-time high of \$372 billion in 2011, with growth
rates in 2011 that exceeded those in 2010. Total cross-border
remittances were more than \$501 billion last year, and are estimated to
reach \$615 billion by 2014.16 Another salient outcome is mass public
attitudes about the global economy. [[A general
assumption]{.underline}]{.mark} in public opinion research [is that
[during a downturn]{.mark}, demand for greater economic closure should
spike, as [individuals scapegoat foreigners]{.mark} for domestic
woes]{.underline}. [The global nature of the 2008 crisis, combined with
anxiety about the shifting distribution of power, should have triggered
a fall in support for an open global economy]{.underline}. Somewhat
surprisingly, [[however]{.mark}, the reverse is true]{.underline}. Pew's
Global Attitudes Project has surveyed a wide spectrum of countries since
2002, asking people about their opinions on both international trade and
the free market more generally.17 [The [results show]{.mark}
**[resilient support]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} expanding [trade]{.mark} and
business ties with other countries]{.underline}. Twenty-four countries
were surveyed both in 2007 and at least one year after 2008, including a
majority of the G20 economies. Overall, eighteen of those twenty-four
countries showed equal or greater support for trade in 2009 than two
years earlier. By 2011, twenty of twenty-four countries showed greater
or equal support for trade compared to 2007. Indeed, between 2007 and
2012, the unweighted average support for more trade in these countries
increased from 78.5 percent to 83.6 percent. Contrary to expectation,
there has been no mass public rejection of the open global economy.
Indeed, public support for the open trading system has strengthened,
despite softening public support for free-market economics more
generally.18 [The final outcome addresses]{.underline} a dog that hasn't
barked: [[the effect of]{.mark} the Great [Recession on]{.mark}
crossborder [conflict]{.mark} and violence]{.underline}. During the
initial stages of the crisis, multiple [analysts asserted that the
financial crisis would lead states to increase their use of force as a
tool for staying in power]{.underline}.19 [Whether through greater
internal repression, diversionary wars, arms races, or a ratcheting up
of great power conflict, there were genuine concerns that the global
economic downturn would lead to an increase in conflict.]{.underline}
Violence in the Middle East, border disputes in the South China Sea, and
even the disruptions of the Occupy movement fuel impressions of surge in
global public disorder. **[[The aggregate data suggests
otherwise]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however. A fundamental conclusion from
a recent report by the Institute for Economics and Peace is that "[the
average level of [peacefulness in]{.mark} 20[12]{.mark} [is]{.mark}
approximately **[the same]{.mark}** [as]{.mark} it was in
20[07]{.mark}."]{.underline}20 [Interstate [violence]{.mark} in
particular has [declined]{.mark} [since the]{.mark} start of the
[financial crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}---as have military expenditures
in most sampled countries. Other studies confirm that **[the Great
[Recession]{.mark} [has not triggered]{.mark} any increase in [violent
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**; the secular decline in violence that
started with the end of the Cold War has not been reversed.21

## warming turn

### 2ac -- warming turn

#### USMCA is CATASTROPHIC for warming\-\--[deregulates]{.underline} ag and entrenches fossil fuel dependence

Ben **Lilliston 18**. Director of Rural Strategies and Climate Change,
\""New NAFTA" continues damaging climate legacy\". Institute for
Agriculture and Trade Policy. 10-17-2018.
https://www.iatp.org/documents/new-nafta-continues-damaging-climate-legacy

[Free trade agreements]{.underline}, [like the]{.underline} 25-year-old
[North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), have been a major driver
of climate change]{.underline}. Through legally-binding rules, [these
deals have favored **high greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting and extractive
industries, like energy and agriculture, over environmental
protection**]{.underline}. The Trump administration's rebranded NAFTA,
called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (**[USMCA]{.underline}**),
[repeats past mistakes by ignoring climate change, disregarding the
pact's **impact on GHG emissions** and **failing to consider how climate
change will affect the three countries into the future**]{.underline}.
The deal stands in stark contrast to the warning in the latest
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that "rapid,
far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society" are
needed to avoid the severe and costly impacts of climate change.1 The
new NAFTA represents a lost opportunity to fundamentally reconsider
trade deals in the context of climate change. The role of trade
agreements in driving climate change has taken on new importance. Recent
research estimated that [**25 percent of global GHG pollution** is from
operations that have been off-shored]{.underline}, [with]{.underline}
the products then imported.2 The U.S. is the number one importer of
products with embedded emissions. [The new NAFTA further]{.underline}
[integrates]{.underline} a North American market for [**fossil-fuel
intensive sectors** like **agriculture**, **forestry** and **energy
itself**]{.underline}. In doing so, the new NAFTA charts a dangerous
path forward, **[accelerating climate change]{.underline}**.
Specifically, the [new NAFTA empowers energy]{.underline} [companies to
legally **challenge environmental protections**]{.underline}, [creates
new venues for]{.underline} [governments]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
**[weaken]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} [**block** environmental
regulations]{.underline}, and facilitates a North American system of
energy, fuel and agriculture that are major sources of GHG emissions.
Here are a few areas of particular concern: Protecting the fossil fuel
industry O[ne of the most highly criticized provisions of NAFTA is the
Investor State Dispute System]{.underline} (ISDS). Under ISDS, [private
corporations can sue governments if they believe a new government policy
treats them unfairly]{.underline}. [Fossil fuel companies have used ISDS
numerous times]{.underline} to sue governments over environmental
protections critical to protect the climate.3 In a step forward, the new
NAFTA phases out ISDS between the U.S. and Canada over three years. But
the existing ISDS will remain in place in U.S.-Mexico relations for the
oil, gas and energy industries, infrastructure, transportation, and
telecommunications sectors. For other sectors, ISDS could be used on a
more limited basis by corporations based in the U.S. or Mexico to
challenge domestic policies unfavorable to the industry. As the Sierra
Club points out,4 "That means, for example, that [Chevron]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [ExxonMobil]{.underline}---the two largest corporate
climate polluters in history and repeat users of
ISDS---[would]{.underline} [be allowed to challenge environmental
protections in Mexico]{.underline} by relying on the same broad
corporate rights that they have used to successfully challenge public
interest policies from Ecuador to Canada." Maintaining ISDS between the
U.S. and Mexico was [a **major win for the oil industry**]{.underline}.5
After 77 years under state ownership, Mexico amended its constitution in
2013 to open its oil and gas reserves to private investment. U.S.-based
energy companies are jumping to invest in Mexico's natural gas
reserves,6 while the two countries explore cross-border electric
transmission projects.7 [A new NAFTA]{.underline} annex on energy
regulatory measures between the U.S. and Canada makes clear the goal is
to [support]{.underline} "North American [energy market
integration]{.underline}," with non-discriminatory access to pipelines
and other electric transmission facilities.8 It's worth noting a
positive step for the climate: New NAFTA does away with the
Proportionality Clause. The highly controversial clause required Canada
(and only Canada) to export a portion of its oil to the U.S.
indefinitely.9 The clause has been linked to the development of the
highly polluting Tar Sands and its elimination should have long-term
benefits for Canada in reducing its GHG emissions. Expanding high GHG
emitting industrial agriculture The original NAFTA largely eliminated
tariffs between the three countries in the trade of agricultural goods.
There were exceptions, including the Canadian dairy, poultry and egg
supply management programs and the U.S. sugar program. The new NAFTA
whittles away at supply management programs in Canada that protect
dairy, poultry and egg producers.10 Canada will allow marginal new
access for U.S. dairy products, while equivalent U.S. access will be
given for Canadian dairy imports. Canada will also provide new access
for U.S. chicken, turkey and eggs. Canada's supply management programs
remain, but are noticeably weaker. (See "'New NAFTA' puts the brakes on
farm policy reforms" for more detail) [The agriculture sector is the
fifth-highest source of GHGs]{.underline} in the U.S., according to the
EPA.11 The primary sources of agriculture emissions are [linked to
large-scale industrial]{.underline} [operations]{.underline}---[the
heavy use of synthetic fertilizers]{.underline} (linked to the GHG
nitrous oxide12) particularly for corn, [and]{.underline} **[methane
emissions associated with livestock]{.underline}** ([mostly
from]{.underline} confined animal feeding operations or
[CAFOs]{.underline}13). California has identified methane emissions from
their giant dairy CAFOs as an important target for the state's climate
mitigation strategy.14 [NAFTA]{.underline}, coupled with the U.S. Farm
Bill, [has played a major role in expanding the CAFO model of
production]{.underline} for pork, poultry, beef and dairy [in all three
countries]{.underline}---where animals often cross borders during their
lifetime as part of an increasingly integrated, tri-national system.15
The Trump administration ignored calls from family farm groups to
include mandatory Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) for meat in new
NAFTA to help consumers support local markets, after Mexico and Canada
had successfully challenged COOL at the World Trade Organization. Recent
research has documented the role of global meat and dairy companies as
major contributors to climate change.16 [The erosion of agricultural
supply]{.underline} [management programs in new NAFTA is a setback for a
**critically important climate strategy**.]{.underline} Supply
management programs reduce GHGs by effectively limiting production,
including on environmentally sensitive land. Supply management programs
that place food grains in reserve are also an important adaptation tool
in years of climate disruption.17 **[Deregulatory
harmonization]{.underline}** The new NAFTA includes a broad and novel
chapter on Good Regulatory Practices.18 The GRP chapter, along with
regulatory provisions in other chapters, consists of a complex,
bureaucratic and confusing web of rules restricting how domestic
regulators research, draft and implement public policies. For the first
time in a U.S. free trade agreement, a chapter that focuses on
regulations broadly will include a dispute settlement
provision---meaning it is legally enforceable. These provisions have no
precedent in the original NAFTA, which contained only limited and
completely voluntary regulatory transparency measures. Under the
chapter, countries will be required to report publicly on regulations
under consideration for the following year and provide justification and
pre-implementation impact assessments. The intended result is to
harmonize state, federal, and international regulations and standards.
The practical result, though, is that corporate interests can head off
proposed regulations, even if such measures are designed specifically to
meet climate goals. Weakening environmental protections [The new NAFTA
Environment Chapter is **considerably weaker than the
original**]{.underline}.19 In 2007, Congress reached a bipartisan
agreement20 to include obligations to seven multilateral environmental
agreements in future Free Trade Agreements: The Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), Montreal Protocol on
Ozone Depleting Substances, Convention on Marine Pollution,
InterAmerican Tropical Tuna Convention (IATTC), Ramsar Convention on
Wetlands, International Whaling Convention (IWC), and Convention on
Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). The new
NAFTA includes only three of those treaties (Montreal Protocol, Marine
Pollution and CITES). Of those three, it weakens the commitment for two
of them, making it generally unenforceable. One of the main criticisms
of trade agreements has been the lack of enforceable environmental
commitments. The new NAFTA contains no substantive changes in this
regard. The Trump administration has yet to conduct an Environmental
Review of the new NAFTA as has been done with recent U.S. free trade
agreements.21 Reinforcing a climate vulnerable agricultural system
Maintaining genetic diversity in crop and animal production is essential
for adapting to climate change, according to a recent report by the UN
Food and Agriculture Organization.22 Climate adaptation strategies
identified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture contain practices that
strengthen soil health and include more perennial and diverse systems.
These same systems have the added benefit of producing less GHGs. Less
diversity and more homogeneity results in agricultural systems
vulnerable to extreme weather and new pests and weeds, all of which are
expected outcomes of climate change. Rather than supporting strategies
to build climate resilience in agriculture, the new NAFTA requires all
participating countries to sign on to a global seed breeders' rights
treaty (known as UPOV91), which prohibits farmers and breeders from
exchanging established seeds.23 (See "'New NAFTA' puts the brakes on
farm policy reforms" for more detail). In addition, it includes new
rules covering patented genetically engineered crops at the behest of
the biotech industry. GE crops, primarily used for monocultural
commodity crop production, have played an integral role in expanding the
high GHG model of agricultural production in the U.S. and Canada. The
USTR boasts that the new NAFTA is superior to the Trans-Pacific
Partnership when it comes to advancing agriculture biotechnology,
including for the first time new technologies like gene editing.24 The
new rules will make it difficult for Mexico and Canada to block imports
of GMO and gene-edited crops approved for use in the U.S., but not in
those countries. (See "Entrenching the non-regulation of food and
agricultural products of "modern biotechnology" in the USCMA" for more
detail) Increasing food safety risks Climate change is expected to
increase risks related to food safety and plant and animal health due to
variances of temperatures and the spread of animal and plant diseases.25
Under new NAFTA, countries would be given new powers to challenge food
safety inspectors who stopped food shipments, and require a quick review
of the action. Equivalency elements in the agreement establish that food
safety systems and inspections are the same in all three
countries---thereby reducing the need for food safety inspections at the
border. A major concern is the inability of governments, including the
U.S., to fully fund enforcement of existing food safety rules. The U.S.
Food and Drug Administration has conducted less than one-third of the
inspections of foreign facilities exporting into the U.S. as required
under the current national food safety law, partially due to a lack of
funding.26 (For more, see Food safety and agricultural biotechnology in
USMCA: the anti-science Trump administration negotiates rules based on
"scientific principles") Undermining the Paris Climate Agreement At the
heart of the Paris Climate Agreement are national-level plans to reduce
GHG emissions.27 Within each plan are goals, policies and strategies to
reduce GHG emissions and adapt to climate change. Both Mexico and Canada
are part of, and remain committed to, the United Nations' Paris Climate
agreement. And while the Trump administration has signaled it will
withdraw from the Accord, at least nine U.S. states and 125 U.S. cities
have expressed their commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement. Each
country, along with sub-federal governments, will need policy
flexibility to meet their climate goals. New climate policies like
carbon markets, carbon taxes, carbon tariffs, emission regulations and
renewable energy programs could come into conflict with new NAFTA's
various deregulatory rules. Conclusion The Trump administration's
attacks on climate action have been numerous. From the announcement to
withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, to attempts to kill the Clean
Power Plan,28 to the steady removal of scientific expertise from
government agencies29---the administration's assault on environmental
protections has been unrelenting. [The new NAFTA represents a critical
opportunity to ensure that trade policy does not conflict with policies
or inhibit investments to reduce greenhouse gases and adapt to climate
change]{.underline}. [Instead of setting a new bar and]{.underline}
**[integrating climate goals within a trade deal]{.underline}**, [the
Trump administration has **done the opposite**]{.underline}, [not only
setting the U.S. back, but also Canada and Mexico, in efforts to address
climate change.]{.underline} [**NAFTA has helped drive GHG emissions**
for the last 25 years. **The climate can't afford to continue this
damaging legacy under the new NAFTA.**]{.underline}

#### Warming causes extinction.

**Cribb 17**---principal of JCA, Fellow of the Australian Academy of
Technological Sciences and Engineering, former Director, National
Awareness, CSIRO (Julian, "The Baker," *Surviving the 21st Century*
Chapter 4, pg 91-94)

[[Unlocking]{.underline}]{.mark} several trillion tonnes of [[methane
would cause]{.underline}]{.mark} global [[temperatures to
**rocket**]{.underline}]{.mark} upwards sharply. Once such a process
gets under way, most experts consider, [[warming will happen **so fast**
it is **doubtful**]{.underline}]{.mark} if [[humans could do
anything]{.underline}]{.mark} to stop it even if they instantly ceased
all burning of fossil fuels. This 'double whammy' of global warming
caused by humans releasing three trillion tonnes of fossil carbon which
then precipitates an uncontrollable second phase driven by the melting
of all or part of the five trillion tonnes of natural methane deposits
(Buff et & Archer 2004) is the principal threat to civilisation in the
twenty-first century and, combined with nuclear conflict (Chap. 4), to
the survival of the human species. The IPCC's fifth report states that
the melting of between 37 and 81 % of the world's tundra permafrost is
'virtually certain' adding "There is a high risk of substantial carbon
and methane emissions as a result of permafrost thawing " ((IPCC 2014a),
p. 74). This could involve the venting of as much as 920 billion tonnes
of carbon. However, the Panel did not venture an estimate for methane
emissions from the melting of the far larger seabed clathrates and a
number of scientists have publicly criticised the world's leading
climate body for remaining so close-lipped about this mega-threat to
human existence. The IPCC's reticence is thought to be founded on a lack
of adequate scientific data to make a pronouncement with
confidence---and partly to fear of the mischief which the fossil fuels
lobby would make of any premature estimates. However, it critics argue,
by the time we know for sure that the Arctic and seabed methane is
escaping in large volumes, it will be too late to do anything about it.
The difficulty is that no-one knows how quickly the Earth will heat up,
as this depends on something that cannot be scientifically predicted:
the behaviour of the whole human species and the timeliness with which
we act. Failure to abolish carbon emissions in time will make a 4--5 °C
rise in temperature likely. As to what that may mean, here are some
eminent opinions : • Warming of 5 °C will mean the planet can support
fewer than 1 billion people---Hans-Joachim Shellnhuber, Potsdam
Institute for Climate Impact Research (Kanter 2009) • With temperature
increases of 4--7 °C **[[billions]{.underline}]{.mark}** of people
[[will have to move]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[there will
be]{.underline}]{.mark} very **[[severe
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**---Nicholas Stern, London School of
Economics (Kanter 2009) • Food shortages, refugee crises, flooding of
major cities and entire island nations, mass extinction of plants and
animals, and a climate so drastically altered it may be dangerous for
people to work or play outside during the hottest times of the
year---IPCC Fifth Assessment (IPCC 2014b) • Corn and soybean yields in
the US may decrease by 63--82 %---Schlenker and Roberts, Arizona State
University (Schlenker & Roberts 2009a) • Up to [[**35%**
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the Earth's [[species will
be]{.underline}]{.mark} committed to
**[[extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}**---Chris Thomas, University of
Leeds (Thomas et al. 2004) • Total polar melting combined with thermal
expansion could involve sea levels eventually rising by 65 m (180 ft),
i.e. to the 20th floor of tall buildings, drowning most of the world's
coastal cities and displacing a third or more of the human population
(Winkelmann et al. 2015) • Intensified global **[[instability,

for North American trade is achievable if we maintain that focus. A new
North American agreement needs strong and enforceable labor and
environmental standards. It needs to raise wages in all three countries,
support unions, repeal right-to-work laws, and end the outsourcing of
jobs and pollution. It needs to protect small and indigenous farmers,
sustainable food systems and consumers by strengthening food labeling
and inspections of imported foods. It needs to make medicine and health
care more accessible and affordable. It needs to protect wildlife, clean
air and water, and the health of our communities. It needs to address
climate change head on and defend the most vulnerable communities from
environmental disasters. Trade must be used to obtain positive goals
that reduce inequality and treat people with dignity. It must prioritize
reparations to indigenous peoples and black and brown communities
through financial compensation and decolonization and respect the
sovereignty of Indigenous Nations to control what happens on their land.
Any new 'trade' deal must be negotiated through a democratic and
transparent process that includes public participation with broad swaths
of society, not just corporations. NAFTA 2 falls far short of meeting
these basic criteria. [Dr. Margaret Flowers and Kevin Zeese
[write](http://tradeforpeopleandplanet.org/trump-trade-revealed-another-rigged-corporate-deal/),
the "new NAFTA framework remains trade for corporations while
undermining health, the environment, food, and worker
rights]{.underline}." NAFTA 2 provides [new
avenues](https://www.iatp.org/documents/new-nafta-imposes-hurdles-delay-and-weaken-public-protections)
for corporations to challenge public interest laws that hurt their
profits. [It maintains NAFTA **offshoring of jobs** and
**pollution**]{.underline} as well as buy american and buy local waivers
for Canadian and Mexican industries. [The USMCA facilitates the
expansion of **chemical agriculture** and GMOs while undermining food
safety inspections and labelling]{.underline}. [It encourages **dirty
energy** from **fracking** and **tar sands**, and fails to even mention
climate change. As the recent [IPCC
report](https://popularresistance.org/ipcc-radical-energy-transformation-needed-to-avoid-1-5-degrees-global-warming/)
shows, **we don't have 16 years** to start talking about climate
change.]{.underline} In terms of offshoring, [the current language of
USMCA allows corporations to send jobs and pollution to Mexico where
**environmental** and human rights **protections are often
lower**]{.underline}. For instance, this new NAFTA would allow metal
recyclers to send [toxic used car
batteries](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2016/02/26/a-dangerous-export-americas-car-battery-waste-is-making-mexican-communities-sick/?noredirect=on&fbclid=IwAR0fw4gOrwoMNAOBtadJWq8gM0AjoGJ8CmQ2jqos8xknaPgIKfqxFDE6xS4)
to Mexican recycling factories that do not have lead exposure controls
and where workers have and continue to get lead poisoning. The US-Mexico
border has become a [dumping
ground](https://therevelator.org/border-betrayed/) for the excessive
waste of corporate America. In terms of energy, fossil fuel companies
are major winners of the new NAFTA. Instead of moving North America
towards renewables, USMCA locks us into oil and gas. According to
[Sierra
Club](https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/www.sierraclub.org/files/NAFTA-environment-statement.pdf)
the USMCA maintains NAFTA rules that prevent the U.S. government, the
Department of Energy, "from determining whether gas exports to Mexico or
Canada are in the public interest." [This basically is an automatic
**guarantee of gas export** which would "incr**ease fracking** in the
U.S., expand cross-border gas pipelines]{.underline}," [and create
greater Mexican dependency on natural gas which has been the **main
contributor**, way more than any other fuel type, to
Mexico's]{.underline} [[recent
increase](https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/www.sierraclub.org/files/uploads-wysiwig/NAFTA%20and%20Climate%20Report%202018.pdf)
in **climate pollution.**]{.underline} Also in Mexico, [the USMCA will
lock in the government's recent **deregulation** of **oil and
gas**]{.underline}. [Big oil successfully lobbied for two
ways]{.underline}--ISDS and good regulatory practices--to [challenge the
Mexican government if it tries to nationalize its energy sector agan.
The USMCA also [supports tar
sands](https://www.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2018/11/opposition-trump-s-pro-polluter-nafta-deal-mounts-ahead-deal-signing)]{.underline},
though in a little different way from NAFTA.. NAFTA supported tar sands
with the proportionality rule that locks in tar sands oil extraction in
Canada. USMCA, on the other hand, supports tar sands [by making it
cheaper for oil companies to export Canadian tar sands through U.S. oil
pipelines.]{.underline} [This could make it harder to shut down existing
tar sands pipelines]{.underline} like Keystone Phase 1, Enbridge line
6b, line 5, and line 17 as well as stop new ones like the proposed
Enbridge line 3. ['USMCA's proposed expansion of the **fossil fuel
empire** is an **environmental disaster** on its own.]{.underline} But,
[NAFTA 2 goes further by **reducing environmental protections** that are
included in the last four US trade deals.]{.underline} It does this by
"[failing to reinforce a standard set of seven]{.underline} Multilateral
Environmental Agreements ([MEA]{.underline})" [that protect **wetland
ecosystems**, **arctic ecosystems**, and **endangered species** and
prevent **overfishing**, **unnecessary marine pollution**, and so much
**more**.]{.underline} An [environmental
coalition](https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/www.sierraclub.org/files/NAFTA-environment-statement.pdf)shows:
"the deal includes standard enforcement language for only one of the
seven MEAs, while using weak language for two and failing to even
mention four of these essential environmental agreements."

#### Ocean biodiversity solves extinction

**Craig '3** (Robin Kundis Craig, Professor at Florida State University
College of Law, leading environmental law scholar who has written
important works on water and ocean and coastal issues, Winter 2003,
"Taking Steps Toward Marine Wilderness Protection? Fishing and Coral
Reef Marine Reserves in Florida and Hawaii," 34 McGeorge L. Rev. 155,
Lexis)

The world's oceans contain many resources and provide many services that
humans consider valuable. "Occupying more than seventy percent of the
Earth's surface and ninety-five percent of the biosphere," oceans
provide food; marketable goods such as shells, aquarium fish, and
pharmaceuticals; life support processes, including carbon sequestration,
nutrient cycling, and weather mechanics; and quality of life, both
aesthetic and economic, for millions of people worldwide. Indeed, [it is
difficult to overstate the importance of the ocean]{.underline} to
humanity's well-being: "[[The ocean is the]{.mark}]{.underline} cradle
of life on our planet, and it remains the axis of existence, the locus
of planetary biodiversity, and the [[engine of]{.underline}]{.mark} the
chemical and [[hydrological cycles that]{.mark}]{.underline} create and
[[maintain]{.mark}]{.underline} our [[atmosphere and
climate]{.underline}]{.mark}." Ocean and coastal ecosystem services have
been calculated to be worth over twenty billion dollars per year,
worldwide. In addition, many people assign heritage and existence value
to the ocean and its creatures, viewing the world's seas as a common
legacy to be passed on relatively intact to future generations. (It
continues...) More generally, "[[ocean ecosystems]{.mark}]{.underline}
play a major role in the global geochemical cycling of all the elements
that [[represent the]{.mark}]{.underline} basic [[building blocks
of]{.mark}]{.underline} living [[organisms]{.underline}]{.mark}, carbon,
nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, and sulfur, as well as other less
abundant but necessary elements". In a very real and direct sense,
[therefore, **[human degradation]{.mark}** of marine ecosystems
**[impairs the planet's ability to support
life]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Maintaining biodiversity is often
critical to maintaining the functions of marine
ecosystems[.]{.underline} Current evidence shows that, in general, [an
[ecosystem]{.mark}'s ability to]{.underline} keep
[[function]{.underline}]{.mark}ing in the face of disturbance
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} strongly [[dependent on its
biodiversity]{.underline}]{.mark}, "[indicating that more diverse
ecosystems are more stable]{.underline}. Coral reef ecosystems are
particularly dependent on their biodiversity. \[\*265\] Most ecologists
agree that the complexity of interactions and degree of interrelatedness
among component species is higher on coral reefs than in any other
marine environment. This implies that the ecosystem functioning that
produces the most highly valued components is also complex and that many
otherwise insignificant species have strong effects on sustaining the
rest of the reef system. n860 Thus, maintaining and restoring the
biodiversity of marine ecosystems is critical to maintaining and
restoring the ecosystem services that they provide. Non-use biodiversity
values for marine ecosystems have been calculated in the wake of marine
disasters, like the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. n861 Similar
calculations could derive preservation values for marine wilderness.
However, economic value, or economic value equivalents, should not be
\"the sole or even primary justification for conservation of ocean
ecosystems. Ethical arguments also have considerable force and merit.\"
n862 At the forefront of such arguments should be a recognition of how
little we know about the sea - and about the actual effect of human
activities on marine ecosystems. The United States has traditionally
failed to protect marine ecosystems because it was difficult to detect
anthropogenic harm to the oceans, but we now know that such harm is
occurring - even though we are not completely sure about causation or
about how to fix every problem. Ecosystems like the NWHI coral reef
ecosystem should inspire lawmakers and policymakers to admit that most
of the time we really do not know what we are doing to the sea and hence
should be preserving marine wilderness whenever we can - especially when
the United States has within its territory relatively pristine marine
ecosystems that may be unique in the world.We may not know much about
the sea, but we do know this much: [**[If we kill the ocean we kill
ourselves,]{.mark} and** we]{.underline} will [take most of **the
biosphere** with us]{.underline}.

#### Extinction\-\--Arctic key.

**Ford 3**, Inuit Circumpolar Conference vice president, 2003 (Violet,
"Global Environmental Change: An Inuit Reality", 10-15,
<http://www.mcgill.ca/files/cine/Ford.pdf>)

[[The Arctic ecosystem is]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[[fundamental]{.underline}]{.mark}** contributor [[to **global
processes** and]{.underline}]{.mark} the balance of **[[life on
earth]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Both the [[unique]{.underline}]{.mark}
physical and biological [[characteristics]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
Arctic ecosystem [[play key roles in maintaining]{.underline}]{.mark}
the integrity of [[the **global environment**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Massive [[ice sheets]{.underline}]{.mark} and ice cover
[[regulate]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[global
temperatures]{.underline}]{.mark} by reflecting much of the solar
radiation back into space, the Arctic ocean influences global ocean
currents which are responsible for a variety of weather conditions and
events, to name but two. The Arctic is also the recipient of the
by-products of southern-based industry and agricultural practices. In
February 2003, UNEP's Governing Council passed [[a resolution
effectively recognizes the Arctic as a "**barometer**" or **indicator
region** of the **globe's environmental health**.]{.underline}]{.mark}
This is important and is further reason why Arctic indigenous peoples
should work together at the international level. Late last year ICC and
RAIPON participated in the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Council
meeting in Beijing, China with the aim of sensitizing this organization
to the Arctic dimension of global environmental issues. I understand
that the GEF is now willing to consider indigenous peoples and their
organizations to be distinct and separate from environmental and other
NGO's.
