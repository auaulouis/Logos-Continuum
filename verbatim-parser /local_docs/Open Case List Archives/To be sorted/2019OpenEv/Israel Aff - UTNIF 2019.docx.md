Summary This report provides an overview of U.S. foreign assistance to
Israel. It includes a review of past aid programs, data on annual
assistance, and analysis of current issues. For general information on
Israel, see CRS Report RL33476, Israel: Background and U.S. Relations,
by Jim Zanotti. [Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of U.S.
foreign assistance since World War II.]{.underline} To date, [the United
States has provided Israel \$134.7 billion]{.underline} (current, or
noninflation-adjusted, dollars) [in bilateral assistance and missile
defense funding. Almost all U.S. bilateral aid to Israel is in the form
of military assistance]{.underline}, although in the past Israel also
received significant economic assistance. At a signing ceremony at the
State Department [on September 14, 2016, representatives of the U.S. and
Israeli governments signed a new 10-year Memorandum of
Understanding]{.underline} (MOU) [on military aid]{.underline} covering
FY2019 to FY2028. [Under the terms of the MOU, the United States pledges
to provide \$38 billion in military aid]{.underline} (\$33 billion in
Foreign Military Financing grants plus \$5 billion in missile defense
appropriations) [to Israel. This MOU replaces a previous \$30 billion
10-year agreement, which runs through FY2018. Israel is the first
international operator of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the Department
of Defense's fifth-generation stealth aircraft, considered to be the
most technologically advanced fighter jet ever made.]{.underline} To
date, [Israel has purchased 50 F-35s in three separate
contracts.]{.underline} P.L. 115-141, [the FY2018 Consolidated
Appropriations Act, provides the following for Israel:]{.underline} 
[\$3.1 billion in Foreign Military Financing]{.underline}, of which
\$815.3 million is for offshore procurement;  [\$705.8 million for
joint U.S.-Israeli missile defense projects]{.underline}, including \$92
million for Iron Dome, \$221.5 million for David\'s Sling, \$310 million
for Arrow 3, and \$82.3 million for Arrow 2;  [\$47.5 million for the
U.S.-Israeli anti-tunnel cooperation program]{.underline};  [\$7.5
million in Migration and Refugee Assistance;]{.underline}  [\$4 million
for the establishment of a U.S.-Israel Center of Excellence in energy
and water technologies;]{.underline}  [\$2 million for the Israel-U.S.
Binational Research & Development Foundation (BIRD) Energy program;
and]{.underline}  [The reauthorization of War Reserves Stock
Allies-Israel (WRSA-I) program through fiscal year 2019. For FY2019, the
Trump Administration is requesting \$3.3 billion in Foreign Military
Financing for Israel]{.underline} and \$500 million in missile defense
aid to mark the first year of the new MOU. The Administration also is
seeking \$5.5 million in Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) funding
for humanitarian migrants to Israel.

#### This funding supports the settler colonial genocide of Palestinians in the Gaza strip.

**[When Washington provides military aid to Israel, the United States is
complicit in war crimes and the systematic destruction of the
Palestinian people.]{.underline}** The United States officially signed
the "single largest pledge of bilateral military assistance in U.S.
history," according to the State department. [The U.S. will provide
Israel with an unprecedented \$38 billion military aid package over a
10-year period]{.underline}, which includes \$5 billion in missile
defense. [The strengthening of the American and Israeli war industries
and the maintenance of the current balance of power of the Middle East
is expected, but it is still **morally reprehensible.**]{.underline}
Seven Billion Dollar Shortfall The \$38 billion military aid is a
shortfall from the \$45 billion package Israeli prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu originally asked for. The current military aid also
establishes certain limitations --- including the agreement that Israel
cannot ask the U.S. for more money during the 10-year period. According
to Haaretz, [Israel "will have to spend all its American aid money on
purchases from U.S. military industries"]{.underline} --- a change from
when Israel previously allowed to use its American aid money on its own
military industries. According to Stephen R. Shalom, a professor at
William Paterson University, **[the new military aid will support
Israel's war crimes --- including the systematic destruction of the Gaza
Strip and the settler-colonization of the West Bank.]{.underline}**
[Israel's conduct is morally unacceptable and a violation of
international law.]{.underline} The American military support of Israel
is also a breach of the Leahy Law which states, "No assistance shall be
furnished... to any unit of the security forces of a foreign country if
the Secretary of State has credible information that such unit has
committed a gross violation of human rights." Reporter Ryan McNamara
wrote in Jacobin Magazine on how ["in just one 24-hour period during
negotiations over the new aid package, Israel bombed Gaza and announced
new settlements in the West Bank city of Hebron. How can the
Palestinians --- who have no air force, command and control, missile
defense and tanks --- defend themselves from one of the world's most
advanced military?]{.underline} Over 2,000 Dead As investigative
journalist Max Blumenthal reported two years ago [during Operation
Protective Edge, Israel's 51-day bombing campaign in the Gaza Strip left
over 2,000 Palestinians dead --- including over 500 children. Like all
wars, women and children tend to be the victims who suffer the most.
When Israel deliberately turns off its electricity to hundreds of
thousands of Palestinians in the middle of winter "as punishment for
joining the \[International Criminal Court\]" and restricts access to
drinking water, they are harming women and children. When Israel
calculates a "calorie count" to starve Palestinians during a blockade,
this has little to do with Hamas.]{.underline} As Shalom points out,
[**"After all, you don't need fifth-generation stealth technology to
blow up civilian houses in the Gaza Strip"** --- the most densely
populated area in the world. **It is time for the United States to drop
its military support for Israel now.**]{.underline} [This is a
relationship strictly defined by American hegemonic and geopolitical
interests --- and it is literally killing people. The only way this will
become possible is if the American people stands in solidarity with
Palestinians by pressuring the government to stop its endorsement of
Israel's actions. Israel has already received \$125 billion in aid from
the United States since World War II.]{.underline} As Christians, we say
no more to war and violence.

#### The settler colonial technologies Israeli genocide operate through a "right to maim" that refuses to allow the colonized to die. Such a state produces a population where, perversely, death becomes desired. This violence breaks the very logic of impact calculus.

**Puar 15** (Jasbir, Professor and Graduate Director of Women\'s and
Gender Studies at Rutgers University "The 'Right' to Maim: Disablement
and Inhumanist Biopolitics in Palestine" *Borderlands* 14, no. 1, p.
6-9) NIJ

III\. The Biopolitics of Settler Colonialism [These practices of bodily
as well as infrastructural debilitation]{.underline}, loosely effaced in
concerns about 'disproportionate force', [indicate the extension or
perhaps the mutation of the 'right to kill' claimed by states in warfare
into what I am calling the 'right to maim'. Maiming as intentional
practice expands biopolitics beyond simply the question of 'right of
death and power over life'; maiming becomes a primary vector through
which biopolitical control is deployed in colonized space and hence not
easily demarcated 'necro' as it is mapped in Mbembe's reworking of
biopolitics.]{.underline} That is to say, [while the distinctions
between living and dying are often recognized through the 'cuts' of race
and the 'folds' of overlapping population construction and management,
maiming, debilitation, and stunting are relatively under-theorized
components of these cuts and folds; centering these processes may
potentially alter presumed relations to living and dying
altogether.]{.underline} Alongside examining how and why Foucault elided
a theory of colonial occupation in his formulation of biopolitics, we
might also ask, **[what is biopolitics in the 21st century---and
especially as informed by the ongoing structure of settler
colonialism?]{.underline}** Recent interventions by [Alex Weheliye and
Mel Chen continue to raise critical issues about the formulation of race
in the theorization of biopolitics]{.underline} (Weheliye 2014; Chen
2012). According to Weheliye, race only became important to Foucault
when it entered European state management, not through colonialism. For
this, Weheliye argues that the frame of biopolitics is foundationally
flawed, for even as Foucault claims that the cut of race drives
biopolitical distinctions, the severing of colonial occupation from a
(belated) state racism relegates race to a derivative status. Weheliye's
rather loose archival excavations of Foucault's work notwithstanding,
[what his and others analyses lay bare is the dearth of theorization of
the biopolitics of colonial regimes, especially that of settler
colonialism, of colonialism as a structure and not an event]{.underline}
(Wolfe 1999; Wolfe 2006). Further, [Scott Morgensen rightly notes that
settler colonialism remains undifferentiated within theorizations of the
biopolitics of colonialism, continuing the propagation of colonialism as
a bygone event or within a naturalized frame of
periodization]{.underline} (Morgensen 2011). Foucault's frame of
biopolitics is intrinsically dedicated to variations of bodily health
and vulnerability. In Security Territory Population, he details the
different regimes of power associated with distinct illnesses. Leprosy
is defined through the sovereign power to exclude; the plague through
disciplinary power of quarantining; and smallpox becomes managed and
regularized as epidemic through what Foucault calls 'regimes of
security', Foucault's formulation of regimes of security informs much of
what Gilles Deleuze would later understand as integral to 'societies of
control' (Deleuze 1997, p. 177). [In Society Must Be Defended Foucault
writes: '... biopolitics will derive its knowledge from, and define its
power's field of intervention in terms of, the birth rate, the mortality
rate, various biological disabilities, and the effects of the
environment']{.underline} (Foucault 2003, p. 245). [Here, disability is
understood as a biologically produced rather than a socially induced
condition.]{.underline} In some sense [Foucault is inadvertently already
mapping the liberal elision between disability as an unfortunate
accident or circumstance and disability as intrinsic to the function of
colonial war machines. 'Biological disabilities' are thus distinct from
the way illness is something that shifts from epidemic to endemic; the
endemic modulates 'the form, nature, extension, duration, and intensity
of the illnesses prevalent in a population ... as permanent factors
which ... sapped the populations' strength, shortened the work week,
wasted energy, and cost money, both because they led to a fall in
production and because treating them was expensive']{.underline}
(Foucault 2003, pp. 243-4). [Within the context of emergent forms of
social welfare that Foucault speaks to, illness needs to be reduced,
contained, isolated, and in some cases abandoned, because it compromises
the thriving of the 'make live' vector. What is clear in contemporary
biopolitics is that economic life can grow without the flourishing of
much of human life, which means precisely that the eliminated and
cordoning off of illness is no longer a hindrance to, but rather is
implicated in, 'make live'.]{.underline} As Foucault writes, 'The
\[old\] right of sovereignty was the right to take life or let live. ...
And then this new right is established: the right to make live and to
let die' (Foucault 2003, p. 241). Foucault notes that sovereignty's old
right was not replaced, rather complemented by this new right 'which
does penetrate it, permeate it' (p. 241).iii Given the interpenetrations
of sovereign and biopolitical power, one mapping we must continually be
alert to is what forms of the sovereign right to take life or let live
are machinating. [The sovereign right to maim implicates all of the
other vectors at once---make die and make live]{.underline} (because
disablement can be productively harnessed into rehabilitation) [as well
as let live and let die, or what Lauren Berlant has dubbed 'slow
death'.]{.underline} In Berlant's framing, [slow death refers to a
population marked for wearing out, a gradual decay of bodies that are
both overworked and under-resourced]{.underline} (Berlant 2007).
**[Maiming functions as slow but simultaneously intensive death-making,
as targeting to maim is an accelerated assault on both bodily and
infrastructural fronts. Different temporalities of living and dying
labor here, a different modulation of time and a reworking of the
temporalities of biopolitics, the stretching of the horizon of life
(what can bare life bear?) and the finality of death into perverted
versions of life that look and feel neither like life nor death, not
even attenuated death.]{.underline}** In this complication of the
temporalities and processes, [the speed of biopolitics turns not through
distinctions between fast and slow, quick and languorous, but rather the
intensification and amplification of 'life itself', and in fact,
'resistance itself' as a target of neglect, damage, and speculative
rehabilitation.]{.underline}iv If slow death is conceptualized as
primarily through the vector of 'let die' or 'make die', [maiming
functions as 'will not let die' and]{.underline}, its supposed
humanitarian complement, ['will not make die'. Maiming masquerades as
'let live' when in fact it acts as 'will not let die'. For example, the
IOF policy of shooting to maim, not to kill, is often misperceived as a
preservation of life.]{.underline} In this version of attenuated life,
neither living nor dying is the aim. [Instead, 'will not let die' and
'will not make die' replaces altogether the coordinate 'make live' or
'let die'. It is not only the right to kill but the right to maim being
exercised as the domain of sovereignty. What kind of sovereignty is
being articulated when the right to kill is enacted as the right to
disable, to target both bodies and infrastructure for disablement? This
element of biopolitics entails targeting for death but not killing.
Israeli state practices of occupation and settler colonialism may well
be rationalized]{.underline}, through the conventional parameters of
living and dying in Foucault's four quadrants of biopolitical
management. The work of Eyal Weizman, Sherene Seikaly, and others have
shown, that [the calories they allow into Gaza, the plotting of the
number of deaths of Hamas members, the transit of fuel, materials,
supplies, all of these parameters are mediated by expert language,
algorithmic calculations, and rational science and framed in a discourse
of humanitarian war.]{.underline} **[Thus what I am explicitly arguing
is that from the discursive and empirical evidence offered by
Palestinians, this foundational biopolitical frame is a liberal fantasy
that produces 'let live' as an alibi for colonial rule and thus indeed
facilitates the covert destruction of 'will not let die'. It is from the
vantage of the occupied]{.underline}**, I argue, and not from state
power nor from the outlook of the occupier, **[that we must apprehend
and contend with revising]{.underline}**---challenging, in fact---**[the
theorization of the mechanisms of violent biopolitical population
creation and maintenance.]{.underline}** How is 'will not let die'
expressed? How is the distinction between death and debility mined? And
how does this capitalization of this distinction occur while
simultaneously obscuring the practices of deliberate maiming? [The
debilitation of the Gazan infrastructure is elaborated in this statement
from Maher Najjar, the Deputy General of Gaza's Coastal Municipalities
Water Utilities (CMWU): There is no water reaching any of the houses
right now. We\'re facing a real catastrophe. Sewage pumps cannot work
because the power plant has been destroyed, so we have sewage flooding
the streets of Gaza. We can\'t assess the extent of the damage as we
can\'t even go out without risking our lives right now. We had five
staff members killed while doing repair work, another two were killed at
home with their families. It will take more than US\$20 million to
rebuild the water and sewage networks, but there\'s no way they can be
rebuilt under blockade. **We have the total collapse of all essential
services and there\'s nothing we can do about it. Believe me, it would
be better if the Israelis just dropped the nuclear bomb on Gaza and get
done with it.** This is the worst ever assault on the Gaza
Strip.]{.underline} (Quotation provided by Schembri 2014; partially
quoted in Al-Helou & Waters 2014) Here, **[debilitation is proffered as
a fate worse than death.]{.underline}** Treating Najjar's statement as
political speech more so than the 'truth' of death as a form of mercy,
the strategy of this speech is perhaps to expose the absolute farce of
Israel's 'let live' praxes. [To suggest that the Gazan population is
better off dead is surely to mock Israel's liberal democratic investment
in humanitarian gestures of 'let live'.]{.underline} Najjar sharply
contests this investment with a vision of humanitarianism that is
startling. [It is as if withholding death---will not let or make die---
becomes an act of dehumanization: the Palestinians are not even human
enough for death.]{.underline} Further, [death is preferable to
disability, a stance that contravenes the human rights model of
disability. Why maiming is especially striking in this historical moment
is because in the face of the rise of disability as a recognized
vulnerable identity in need of state and global human rights
protections, seeking to debilitate, or to further debilitate the
disabled, contrasts heavily with the propagation of disability as a
socially maligned condition that must be empowered to and through a
liberal politics of recognition.]{.underline} Beyond the twisted
hypocrisy of the Israeli state in regards to disabilities (which I
examine at length in 'Disabled Diaspora, Rehabilitating State', a
chapter in my forthcoming book, States of Debility and Capacity)
[sanctioning maiming, which is distinct from sanctioning the 'collateral
damage' of civilian deaths, bespeaks a profound failure in the global
human rights framing of disability as a protected and supported social
difference---protected and supported unless it is part of the war tactic
of a settler colonial regime, **one financially buttressed by the United
States.**]{.underline} This is all the more ironic given that Israel is
a signatory on the United Nations Convention for the Rights of People
with Disabilities (Schulze 2010) (as well as for the UNC for the Rights
of the Child). Not to mention this other contortion of the relation
between the cripple and the disabled: Gaza has a Paralympics team, one
that is actually much more successful than the main Olympic team
(Al-Mughrabi 2012; Degun 2012).

#### Settler colonial violence in its embracement of the sovereign right to maim connects colonial and racial violences from Gaza to Ferguson. It is the very metaphysics of genocide which emerge in Israeli occupation.

Jasbir Puar's work in [The Right to Maim is crucial to understanding not
only that the nature of settler colonialism is genocidal but also how
that genocidal nature operates. Settler colonialism is]{.underline}, in
each and every case, [a state operation]{.underline}, but the more
fucked up--and therefore better--way to put this, because it bears at
least a tiny potential to shock, is that in each and every case, the
state is a settler colonial operation. Moreover, as Puar teaches us,
[the statist, settler colonial operation, in its genocidal nature, is
given in the horrific resonance, the brutal articulation, the asymptotic
non-convergence, of killing and maiming. In
thinking]{.underline}---along with and by way of Puar---[the unlikely
and unavoidable locale of Ferguson, Gaza we encounter the instrumental
rationality through which this bloody reverberation is ceaselessly
achieved and announced. What she helps us see is that genocide is
regulation unto the vanishing point of extermination; it is savage
attenuation carried out and on with all deliberate speed. We can kill
them one by one, they say, and this will have been
interminable.]{.underline} They can't kill us all, we say, but
regulation is given in the interminable series of my black death. Then,
we're talking our way out of their freedom because it's not just that
freedom and slavery are in the same place but that their entanglement
constitutes that place. Puar is a vital and indispensable part of the
chorus that allows and requires us to ask, [what if the terms and
conditions of the ongoing genocide we survive, but wherein each and
every one of us will have been murdered, is way deeper than, and cannot
be encompassed by, the intimate opposition of slavery and freedom, exile
and home, occupation and sovereignty?]{.underline} Such militantly
anti-military thinking requires considering another irreducible
entanglement---that of blackness and indigeneity. This requires
understanding, along with Robin D. G. Kelley, that Africa is a field of
indigeneity violated by settler colonial incursion's constant
articulation with the constant articulation of slavery and freedom,
given in what Hortense Spillers might call extended intramural, as well
as extramural, catastrophe. Indeed, Afro-diasporic life, both within the
continent of Africa and in all of its transoceanic variants, doesn't
just bear the trace, but is, more fundamentally, the residual of
settler-colonial violation, recognizing that residuality, in the complex
intra-activity of displacement and derivation, refuge and refusal, that
it bears, can never be reduced to being either the effect or creation of
the violator. So that the entanglement of blackness and
indigeneity--given in a mode of solidarity that will have never been
wholly voluntary in its ongoing emergence from and as something way on
the other side of what is manifest in the coalitions of political
subjects and their state or pre-state formations--is constantly
disbursed in habits of displacement and sub-communal movement whose
energy the political propriety of settlement comes to regulate and
consume. Such disbursal is exhaustive, lived in and as exhaustion, as
the solidarity of a shared atmosphere wherein an alternative
(meta)physics of the alternative is implied. Such implication is
manifest gesturally, in social life's refusal of real politics,
something Ashon T. Crawley might call mutually resuscitative,
(pre)occupied, blackpalestinian breath. [Ferguson and Gaza are also
entangled---like settler coloniality and the state and like the violent
two-state solution (i.e., the United States and the State of Israel) in
which Ferguson and Gaza will have been dissolved---and we need to try to
understand the difference between the people who know that and the
people who don't. Puar knows, and shapes common knowledge of our common,
if neither proximate nor synchronized, aspiration.]{.underline} In its
inveterate statelessness, blackpalestinian breath is both imposed
disability and elective affinity, against the grain of every deadly,
fetishistic modality of vitalism given in the state's serial
self-support and self-consultancy, which takes its most venal form in
martial intellectuality, a range of training protocols wherein
scholarship fulfills itself, unto its vanishing point, as a branch of
the armed forces. What are the implications for blackpalestinian breath
of the necessarily settler-colonial state's exercise of what Puar calls
the will "not to let die," which is a matter of military reason? [Do the
logic and metaphysics of the individual life continually lubricate the
machine that exercises the right to kill in the will not to let die? If
genocide, in the end, is just this continual maiming, which moves in the
non-space between killing each and every one and the constantly
cultivated, measured, and tested inability to kill all, then how might
we offer, in practicing, a form of informal, enforming life that
continually refuses the very idea of a basic human unit and its always
already racialized embodiment? Such embodiment is a disability, a wound,
our shared flesh shares and so we have to ask if debilitative
individuation is fundamental to the logic of genocide because it exposes
the limits of genocide's implied metaphysics. Where attempts at mass
death strain against the limits of accounting, the imposition of the
body-in-individuation is this perpetual wounding and incarceration of
the mass--an ongoing maiming that obliterates sacrilege and sacrifice.
But what do we say about the structures of incompleteness that attend
and precede this maiming, which is not simply an imposition of
incompleteness but the enforcement of a certain incompleteness, one
given in the chalk-outlined conceptual figuration of the body itself
when it is reduced to stasis, which is, if you'll forgive me, its
natural state. It is necessary, then, to unexplain such vicious
culmination and the amputative diminishment it bears. The very idea of
Black Lives, or Palestinian Lives, those carceral sets of pluralized
singularities, bears the incapacitating capacity to be counted, a burden
that is not a matter of mattering but is, rather, the ghoulish
convergence of de-materialization and de-animation. Here, it is
important to note, by way of Puar, that this is as much a denial of
death as it is a reductively repetitive and representational death
sentence, which seeks to detach decay from decomposition and, thus, from
(re)generation. What's at stake is something paradoxical---like a local
anaesthesia that seeks to impose a general anaesthetic
effect.]{.underline} Blackpalestinian breath is genocidally cut short in
the complex, structurally separable instantiation of Black and
Palestinian Lives, one by one. [Meanwhile, the new, co-constituting
assemblage of Ferguson, Gaza that Puar critically celebrates allows and
requires us to ask what it would mean to recognize, but also to embrace
and enact, the exhaustion of the state solution. We give life to the
state solution when we breathe air into the dead language of lives and
bodies. Perhaps we can embrace and enact that exhaustion when we say
another naming, against the grain of nominalized individuation and the
state and stasis for which such naming inadvertently
settles.]{.underline} This would be the enactment of a healthy
incompleteness arrayed against order and its terms, as Cedric Robinson
might say, where blackpalestinian study's interinannimation of ascent
and descent and assent and dissent---its improper complexities of
hostility and hospitality, its jurisgenerative harvest on unowned land,
its sounding ululative height in melismatic underground---works like an
organ without a body, as more + less than one.

#### These colonial and racial processes are an extinction level event. Only the affirmative intervenes at the level of both theory and policy to challenge this.

University of California, Los Angeles "Robin D.G. Kelley & Fred Moten in
Conversation" Transcribed from

MOTEN: Well, um, first, I mean, the work I did around, um, you know, the
ASA's, um, you know, decision to endorse the academic and cultural
boycott of Israel was really minimal and minor compared to a lot of
other people who were really out front, um, and, and have been working
tirelessly for that for many, many years. Um, and I think, you know,
the, my contribution was more, you know, rhetorical in many ways in, in,
in, and, and maybe, maybe theoretical only in the most minimal sense, in
the sense that what I wanted to do was a couple of things. First, to
recognize that, um, you know, let\'s say that [the conditions of what
people call modernity]{.underline}, um, in, in, in, in, [or global
modernity]{.underline}, that the fundamental conditions that make that
up [are]{.underline}, you know, [settler colonialism. And I think we can
talk about settler colonialism in ways that are broader than the normal
way that we usually think of them as a set of violent and brutal
relations between Europe and the rest of the world. Because I think
it\'s really important.]{.underline} And, and, and again, our, our
mutual friend and mentor Cedric Robinson, pointed this out emphatically,
and in brilliant ways early on, that [settler colonialism is also an
intra-European affair.]{.underline} Um, and it\'s important to
understand that. [It\'s important to understand this historic
relationship between settler colonialism in the enclosure of the
commons]{.underline}, um, [which is part]{.underline} and, part [of the
origins of]{.underline}, of what we now know or understand as
[capitalism. But if we understand that settler colonialism, that the
transatlantic slave trade]{.underline}, um, [and that]{.underline}, you
know, [the emergence of a set of philosophical formulations that
essentially provide for us some modern conception of self that has as
its basis a kind of possessive, heteronormative, patriarchal
individuation, right? That\'s what it is to be yourself on the most
fundamental level.]{.underline} You know, and if you ask anybody in the
philosophy department, they\'ll tell you that that\'s true, you know,
and they won't be joking, right, that, um, that, these, that [these
constitute the basis of]{.underline}, of [our modernity. But for most of
the people who live in the world]{.underline}, actually for everybody
who lives in the world, although most of the people in live in the world
are actually able to both recognize this and say this, [that modernity
is a social and ecological disaster that we live, that we now attempt to
survive. Okay? **And if we take that up, then part of what\'s at stake
is that we recognize that feminist and queer interventions against
heteronormative patriarchy, that Black interventions against the theory
and practice of slavery, which is ongoing, that indigenous interventions
against settler colonialism constitute the general both practical and
intellectual basis for not only our attempts to survive, but also our
attempts to, as I said before, save the Earth.**]{.underline} And, and I
put it in terms that the great poet Ed Roberson puts it; [not just to
save the Earth, but to see the Earth before the end of the world. And
this is an emergency that we\'re in now and it\'s urgent.]{.underline}
Um, and I believe that [there's a specific convergence of black thought
and indigenous thought that situates itself precisely in relation
to]{.underline}, and is articulated through, [the interventions of queer
thought and feminist thought that we want to take up.]{.underline} And,
and it, [and it strikes me as]{.underline}, for me at least, it\'s,
it\'s a way of taking up a kind an---it\'s, [it's a way of imagining how
one might be able to, how we might be able to walk more lightly on the
Earth. To honor the Earth as we walk on it, as we stand on it. To not
stomp on it, to not stomp all over it, where every step you take is a
claim of ownership.]{.underline} And, and this is one way to put it,
would be to not so presumptuously imagine that the Earth can be reduced
to something so paltry and so viciously understood as what we usually
call home. This is part of the reason why the queer and the feminist
critique is so important. It\'s a critique of a general problematic
notion of domesticity. It\'s like another way of being on the Earth that
doesn\'t allow you in some vicious and brutal way to claim that it is
yours, right? Um, this is important and this is so, you know, often the
methods that we use to claim the Earth as ours involved fences, borders.
[This manifests itself on a private level from household to household,
but it also manifests itself on a national level, and at the level of
the nation state, and it\'s not an accident that settler colonial states
take it upon themselves to imagine themselves to be the living
embodiment of the legitimacy of the nation state as a political and
social form. For me, there\'s two reasons to be in solidarity with the
people of Palestine. One is because they\'re human beings and they\'re
being treated with absolute brutality, but the other is that there\'s a
specific resistance to Israel as a nation state.]{.underline} And for my
money, to be perfectly clear about this, [I believe that this nation
state of Israel is itself an artifact of antisemitism. If we thought
about Israel and Zionism, not just as a form of racism that results in
the displacement of Palestinians, but if we also think about them as
artifacts of the historic displacement of Jews from Europe]{.underline},
right, [in the same way that we might think of]{.underline}, let\'s say
[Sierra Leone or Liberia as artifacts of racist
displacement]{.underline}, okay. If we think about it that way, okay,
and another, and the reason I\'m saying this is just to make sure that
you know that there\'s a possible argument against the formulation that
criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic when we know that Donald Trump is a
staunch supporter, that people like Pat Robertson in the United States
are staunch supporters that help us to the fact that you can be deeply
anti-Semitic and support the state of Israel. These things go together.
They\'re not antithetical to one another. [So that it becomes important
for us to be able to suggest that resistance to the state of Israel is
also resistance to the idea of the legitimacy of the nation
state.]{.underline} It\'s not an accident that Israel has taken upon
itself, that when Israel takes upon itself, when the defense of Israel
manifests itself as a defense of its right to exist, this is important.
It\'s a defense, not just of Israel\'s right to exist, but of the nation
state as a political form's right to exist. And nation states don\'t
have rights. What they\'re supposed to be are mechanisms to protect the
rights of the people who live in them, and that has almost never been
the case, and to the extent that they do protect the rights of the
people who live in them, it\'s in the expense, it\'s at the expense of
the people who don\'t, okay. So part of what\'s at stake, one of the
reasons why it\'s at, it\'s important to pay particular attention to
this issue, why we ought to resist the ridiculous formulation that
singling out Israel at this moment is itself anti-Semitic is because
it\'s important to recognize that Israel is the state. \[KELLEY:
Right.\] MOTEN: For reasons that I think are totally bound up with
antisemitism, right? Israel is the state that, insofar as it makes the
claim about its right to exist, is also making the claim about the
nation state's right to exist as such. It\'s this, it\'s that same kind
of argument that, I remembered the---and I\'m sorry to keep going on so
long, but there\'s---there\'s those formulations that people often make
about Black people in it or indigenous people as if they were the
essence of the human, right, so that every time Black people or
indigenous people do something that supposedly we\'re not supposed to
do, it constitutes a violation to the very idea of the human. Right,
because somehow as a function of the nobility of our suffering, we
constitute the very idea of humanity, right? And there\'s nothing more
brutal, right? Nothing more vicious than having been being consigned to
that position. Similarly, [Israel as a function of anti-Semitism has now
been placed in the position of protecting the very idea of the nation
state. So for me, first and foremost, it\'s important to have solidarity
with the Palestinian people, but second of all, it\'s important to
actually have some solidarity with the Jewish people insofar as they can
and must be separated from the Israeli state because ultimately the fate
of the Jewish people, if it is tied to this, to the nation state of
Israel, will be more brutal than anything that has yet been done or can
be imagined]{.underline}, and I mean everything that you think I mean
when I say that.

#### Therefore, plan: The United States federal government should prohibit Direct Commercial Sales and Foreign Military Sales of arms from the United States to the State of Israel.

#### Foreign Military Sales and Direct Commercial Sales by the US to Israel has single-handedly allowed Israel to expand its military to global proportions. These sales specifically make it possible for Israel to wage war against Palestine.

US-Israel Military Cooperation [The US-Israeli military cooperation
dates back to the 1940s.]{.underline} After World War I, Great
Britainbin its effort to curb the Arab struggle for independence in its
territories collaborated with the Zionists in their mission to colonize
Palestine to build a Jewish State. When Great Britain and France emerged
economically and military crippled from World War II, they lost grip
over their territories in the Middle East and were quickly replaced by
the US as the sole dominant power in the region. [Washington became the
strongest backer of the campaign to disposes the Palestinians of their
lands to install a Jewish state by means of violence and coercion. The
US government saw that the Zionist colonization of Palestine as a
potential weapon against anti-imperialist struggle sand secure its
interests in energy resources in the region.]{.underline} During the
heights of the Cold War, the US kept the Soviets out of the
Mediterranean by diverting the attention of Soviet-armed Syria and Iraq
towards Israel from Turkey, which had to be maintained within the
American bloc. During the Arab-Israeli War in 1973, the United States
implemented Operation Nickel Grass that overtly airlifted weapons to
Israel. Between October 14 and November 14, 1973, the Military Airlift
Command of the US Air Force flew 22, 325 tons of artillery, ammunition,
supplies, and even tanks to their ally fighting against the Syria and
Egypt. Stronger military ties were developed in the 1980s and onwards
through different agreements (see Table 1). The two governments worked
together to develop sophisticated military technology such as the
David's Sling counter-rocket and Arrow missile defense systems. Israel's
military research and development complex pioneered many cutting-edge
technologies used today, which include cyber weapons, robots, aerial
drones, sensors and electronic warfare systems, and advanced defense for
military vehicles. [Despite limited manpower and resources, Israel's
armed force has become one of the world's most technologically advanced
militaries. It is the largest recipient of foreign military aid from the
US, which cover almost a quarter of the overall Israeli defense
budget.US military aid to Israel since the 1940s has amounted to around
USD 70 billion. Part of the aid is being used to purchase major weapons
systems from the US. Israel also enjoys the rare privilege of using a
substantial portion of US aid to source locally made weapons. Thus,
Israel was able to strengthen its local defense industry and became
capable of exporting large quantities of arms.]{.underline} Currently,
Israel is the 10th largest arms exporter in the world. In 2006, Israel
aided its US ally against Iraq and Afghanistan by supplying it with
weapons worth USD 1.1 billion. [The US has three weapons transfer
programs to channel USD 18.87 billion worth of weapons, ammunition
rounds and related equipment to Israel]{.underline} between 2000-2009.
[These programs are the Foreign Military Sales (FMS), Direct Commercial
Sales (DCS), and Excess Defense Articles (EDA), through which the US
Defense Department supplied Israel weapons and military equipment
numbering to 670 million. The US provided Israel 500 different
categories of weapons, which include items like tear gas canisters,
ammunition, high power rifles, military vehicles, and 93 F-16D fighter
jets. In 2007, the Bush Administration and the Israeli government signed
a Memorandum of Understanding for a 10-year (2009 -- 2018) USD 30
billion military aid budget. The MOU still provides Israel the exemption
of spending more than a quarter of US military aid (26.3%) on its own
domestic weapons industry while all other recipients of US military aid
are required to spend it only on weapons and materials manufactured by
US corporations. The US also gives another \$504 million to fund
research, development, and production of Israel's Iron Dome anti-rocket
system (\$235 million), the David's Sling (\$149.7 million), the Arrow
improvement program (or Arrow II, \$44.3 million), and Arrow III (\$74.7
million)]{.underline} (see Box 2. US-Israel Defense Projects). US-Israel
Economic and Business Partnerships Aside from military aid, the US
provides economic assistance to Israel, which amounts to around USD 30
billion since the 1940s. Loan guarantees are also provided to help
Israel borrow from other sources at lower interest rates. USD 10 billion
in loan guarantees was approved by the Congress to assist Israel absorb
the mass of immigrants coming from Russia and other Eastern bloc
countries after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The US helped
finance the resettlement of European Jews, who survived the Nazi's
anti-semitic purges, in the lands of Palestine through its immigration
aid. This provided the Zionists thousands of Jews to reinforce its
movement for a Jewish state, and also to prevent Jewish immigrants from
resettling in non-Nazi Europe and US soil. The Migration and Refugee
Assistance grant has reached USD 1.7 billion since the 1940s.
Partnerships in business and science were also inked between the two
countries. Leading US companies such as the IBM, Intel, General
Electric, Imation, Microsoft, and Texas Instruments invest in Israel and
have set up technology incubators. Likewise, Israeli start-ups partner
with US companies in developing software applications such as instant
messaging, internet telephony and data mining. US Aid to Palestine In
total, Israel received more than USD 123 billion from the US since 1949
until 2014. In contrast, Palestine received only around USD 5 billion
from the US since the 1990s. In 2013,total US aid to Palestine amounted
to USD 426.7 million. This is less than a quarter (roughly 15%) of what
Israel received in military aid alone from the US in the same year (USD
3.1 billion). This aid is also rife with conditionalities, including
withholding aid if it will be used to support Hamas and the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO),and if Palestine will seek membership in
the United Nations and in other UN Specialized agencies. In November
2012 during a similar conflict in Gaza, the US showed staunch support
for its ally when it voted against Palestinian Statehood along with
Israel and 7 other countries, while 138 other countries voted yes. To
punish Palestine, the US withheld aid amounting to USD 295. 7 million.
Israel acted in the same fashion, withholding around USD 100 million in
taxes that it is supposed to remit to Palestine. This resulted into a
public deficit so huge that the Palestinian Authority (PA) cannot pay
the salaries of public sector workers. New threats of withholding aid to
Palestine were made by Congress in April 2014 after Palestine signified
its intent to sign on to 15 UN affiliated bodies.\[1\] Again, Israel
withheld USD 100 million worth of taxes, a move to which US called
"unfortunate." Conclusion **[The massive amount of aid provided by the
US makes it fully complicit and responsible for Israel's genocide in
Gaza.]{.underline}** Since the 1940's, the US has stood by its ally to
secure their mutual interests in the region, which include keeping
energy resources in Middle East open to access by corporations based in
the US and other Western countries. Israel as the US military outpost in
the region has served as a potent threat to neighboring oil-producing
countries to toe the line drawn by US policies. The attacks in Gaza are
directly related to Israel's desire to control the gas fields in
Palestine's marine territory to avert an impending energy crisis. United
Kingdom's British Gas and US Company Noble Gas have already lined up to
invest in the gas field.\[2\] The US-Israel partnership is made stronger
through the passing of the US Senate legislation to provide emergency
funds amounting USD 225 million for Israel's Iron Dome. Additionally,
the US Senate Resolution 498 condemns unprovoked rocket fire and calls
on Hamas to stop all rocket attacks on Israel.Recently, the US clearly
stood against human rights when it solely voted against the proposal to
establish an inquiry into Israel's Gaza offensive by the UN Human Rights
Council. [People's movements and civil society around the world should
condemn and continue exposing the US-Israel partnership in the genocide
of the Palestinians. The international community should pressure the US
to withdraw its military aid and projects from Israel and recognize
Palestine's right to freedom and self-determination.]{.underline}

#### Settler colonial theory provides the intellectual and activist frame necessary to translate our scholarship beyond the mere moral outrage. Yet, commitment to decolonization does not require us to ignore the difficult practicalities of decolonization. Using the settler colonial state to challenge settler colonialism elsewhere does not require us to disavow settler colonialism here, only that we take accept the complexity of current geopolitics.

**Busbridge 18** (Rachel, Lecturer in Sociology at the Australian
Catholic University, Melbourne "Israel-Palestine and the Settler
Colonial 'Turn': From Interpretation to Decolonization" *Theory, Culture
& Society* 35, no. 1, p. 110-111) NIJ

[In his assessment of the dire state of contemporary Palestinian
politics, Hilal]{.underline} (2015: 360) [yearns for 'an investment in
cultural and \...social capital, through informal and formal
associations, the social media and cross-border interaction and
collaborative efforts, to keep Palestine alive as a symbol of
emancipation, freedom and justice'.]{.underline} As I have sought to
show, **[the settler colonial paradigm may indeed be facilitating this:
not only does it provide international audiences a far more readable and
cohesive frame with which to understand the conflict, but it comes with
a built-in solidarity. Additionally, and most vitally, it promises to
rejuvenate the Palestinian struggle under the prescriptive banner of
decolonization, opening up new debates and alternatives outside of an
evidently failing two-state paradigm.]{.underline}** [Yet]{.underline},
as I have also argued, [this is where the most strident limitations of
the settler colonial paradigm paradoxically come into view, due
to]{.underline}, at best, [under-developed reflection on the
possibilities and practicalities of decolonization and]{.underline}, at
worst, [connotations deriving from its contextual point of origin
flattening out important local historical and socio-political
specificities. I highlight these limitations]{.underline} not to
challenge the paradigm's applicability to Israel-Palestine, but [to
appeal for greater rigour and attentiveness to
particularity.]{.underline} I have sought to gesture towards some of
these particularities -- namely, the role of nationalism and the
peculiar resonances of the settler/native distinction. By way of
conclusion, however, [I would like to point towards the challenges of
the settler colonial paradigm's insistence on an ontology of absolute
polarity of settler and native for the types of political mobilizations
and struggles it could inaugurate.]{.underline} To be sure, [there are
immense difficulties in reckoning with heterogeneity in seemingly
permanent structures of settler colonialism which all too easily
assimilate nuance into legitimation; these difficulties are only
amplified in the context of long-term intractable conflict like that in
Israel-Palestine. Yet]{.underline}, as Joyce Dalsheim (2013) has argued
in the context of Israeli settlers, [the entrenchment of polarized
discourse means that we often miss alternative models of political
community that may better serve the project of decolonization. It would
certainly be a shame for the paradigm's inconsistencies regarding a
decolonization effectively rendered impossible to stand against its
broader resonance]{.underline}, just as it would the disciplinary
dimensions of the settler colonial ontology to shut down debate -- or,
indeed, joint mobilization -- between those broadly on the same page
concerning Palestine. In his work on joint Arab-Jewish activism, Marcelo
Svirsky (2014: 328) maintains that [what settler colonial studies needs
'is a corrective ontology and an affective change of heart'. I thus end
with the caution that without this affective change in heart the settler
colonial paradigm may continue to facilitate transnational solidarity
and international sympathy, but may ultimately fail to extend beyond a
politics of moral outrage.]{.underline}

#### Reject large-scale future suffering---distorts reasons and ignores ongoing violence.

**Olson 15** (Elizabeth, Professor of Geography at the University of
North Carolina, Chapel Hill "Geography and Ethics I: Waiting and
Urgency" *Progress in Human Geography* 39, no. 4, p. 520-523) NIJ

Though toileting might be thought of as a special case of bodily
urgency, geographic research suggests that [the body is increasingly set
at odds with larger scale ethical concerns, especially large-scale
future events of forecasted suffering. Emergency planning is a
particularly good example in which the large-scale threats of future
suffering can distort moral reasoning.]{.underline} Žižek (2006) lightly
develops this point in the context of the war on terror, where [in the
presence of fictitious and real ticking clocks and warning systems, the
urgent body must be bypassed because there are bigger scales to worry
about: What does this all-pervasive sense of urgency mean ethically? The
pressure of events is so overbearing, the stakes are so high, that they
necessitate a suspension of ordinary ethical concerns.]{.underline}
After all, displaying moral qualms when the lives of millions are at
stake plays into the hands of the enemy. (Žižek, 2006) [In the presence
of large-scale future emergency, the urgency to secure the state, the
citizenry, the economy, or the climate creates new scales and new
temporal orders of response]{.underline} (see Anderson, 2010; Baldwin,
2012; Dalby, 2013; Morrissey, 2012), [many of which treat the urgent
body as impulsive and thus requiring management.]{.underline} McDonald's
(2013) analysis of three interconnected discourses of 'climate security'
illustrates how bodily urgency in climate change is also recast as a
menacing impulse that might require exclusion from moral reckoning. [The
logics of]{.underline} climate security, especially those related to
[national security, 'can encourage perverse political responses that not
only fail to respond effectively]{.underline} to climate change [but may
present victims of it as a threat']{.underline} (McDonald, 2013: 49).
**[Bodies that are currently suffering cannot be urgent, because they
are excluded from the potential collectivity that could be suffering
everywhere in some future time.]{.underline}** [Similar bypassing of
existing bodily urgency is echoed in writing about violent
securitization]{.underline}, such as drone warfare (Shaw and Akhter,
2012), [and also in intimate scales like the street and the school,
especially in relation to race]{.underline} (Mitchell, 2009; Young et
al., 2014). **[As large-scale urgent concerns are institutionalized, the
urgent body is increasingly obscured through technical planning and
coordination]{.underline}** (Anderson and Adey, 2012). The predominant
characteristic of this institutionalization of large-scale emergency is
a 'built-in bias for action' (Wuthnow, 2010: 212) that circumvents
contingencies. [The urgent body is at best an assumed eventuality, one
that will likely require another state of waiting]{.underline}, such as
triage (e.g. Greatbach et al., 2005). Amin (2013) cautions that in much
of the West, governmental need to provide evidence of laissez-faire
governing on the one hand, and assurance of strength in facing a
threatening future on the other, produces 'just-in-case preparedness'
(Amin, 2013: 151) of neoliberal risk management policies. In the US,
['personal ingenuity' is built into emergency response at the expense of
the poor and vulnerable for whom '\[t\]he difference between abjection
and bearable survival']{.underline} (Amin, 2013: 153) [will not be
determined by emergency planning]{.underline}, but in the material
infrastructure of the city. In short, **[the urgencies of the body
provide justifications for social exclusion of the most marginalized
based on impulse and perceived threat, while large-scale future
emergencies effectively absorb the deliberative power of urgency into
the institutions of preparedness and risk avoidance.]{.underline}**
Žižek references Arendt's (2006) analysis of the banality of evil to
explain the current state of ethical reasoning under the war on terror,
noting that [people who perform morally reprehensible actions under the
conditions of urgency assume a 'tragic-ethic grandeur']{.underline}
(Žižek, 2006) [by sacrificing their own morality for the good of the
state.]{.underline} But his analysis fails to note that bodies are today
so rarely legitimate sites for claiming urgency. [In the context of the
assumed priority of the large-scale future emergency, the urgent body
becomes literally nonsense, a non sequitur within societies, states and
worlds that will always be more urgent. If the important ethical work of
urgency has been to identify that which must not wait, then the capture
of the power and persuasiveness of urgency by large-scale future
emergencies has consequences for the kinds of normative arguments we can
raise on behalf of urgent bodies.]{.underline} How, then, might waiting
compare as a normative description and critique in our own urgent time?
Waiting can be categorized according to its purpose or outcome (see
Corbridge, 2004; Gray, 2011), but it also modifies the place of the
individual in society and her importance. As Ramdas (2012: 834) writes,
'waiting ... produces hierarchies which segregate people and places into
those which matter and those which do not'. The segregation of waiting
might produce effects that counteract suffering, however, and Jeffery
(2008: 957) explains that though the 'politics of waiting' can be
repressive, it can also engender creative political engagement. In his
research with educated unemployed Jat youth who spend days and years
waiting for desired employment, Jeffery finds that 'the temporal
suffering and sense of ambivalence experienced by young men can generate
cultural and political experiments that, in turn, have marked social and
spatial effects' (Jeffery, 2010: 186). Though this is not the same as
claiming normative neutrality for waiting, it does suggest that waiting
is more ethically ambivalent and open than urgency. In other contexts,
however, our descriptions of waiting indicate a strong condemnation of
its effects upon the subjects of study. Waiting can demobilize radical
reform, depoliticizing 'the insurrectionary possibilities of the present
by delaying the revolutionary imperative to a future moment that is
forever drifting towards infinity' (Springer, 2014: 407). Yonucu's
(2011) analysis of the self-destructive activities of disrespected
working-class youth in Istanbul suggests that this sense of infinite
waiting can lead not only to depoliticization, but also to a disbelief
in the possibility of a future self of any value. Waiting, like urgency,
can undermine the possibility of self-care two-fold, first by making
people wait for essential needs, and again by reinforcing that waiting
is '\[s\]omething to be ashamed of because it may be noted or taken as
evidence of indolence or low status, seen as a symptom of rejection or a
signal to exclude' (Bauman, 2004: 109). This is why Auyero (2012)
suggests that waiting creates an ideal state subject, providing
'temporal processes in and through which political subordination is
produced' (Auyero, 2012: loc. 90; see also Secor, 2007). Furthermore,
Auyero notes, it is not only political subordination, but the subjective
effect of waiting that secures domination, as citizens and non-citizens
find themselves 'waiting hopefully and then frustratedly for others to
make decisions, and in effect surrendering to the authority of others'
(Auyero, 2012: loc. 123). Waiting can therefore function as a
potentially important spatial technology of the elite and powerful,
mobilized not only for the purpose of governing individuals, but also to
retain claims over moral urgency. But there is growing resistance to the
capture of claims of urgency by the elite, and it is important to note
that even in cases where the material conditions of containment are
currently impenetrable, arguments based on human value are at the
forefront of reclaiming urgency for the body. In detention centers,
clandestine prisons, state borders and refugee camps, geographers point
to ongoing struggles against the ethical impossibility of bodily urgency
and a rejection of states of waiting (see Conlon, 2011; Darling, 2009,
2011; Garmany, 2012; Mountz et al., 2013; Schuster, 2011).
Ramakrishnan's (2014) analysis of a Delhi resettlement colony and
Shewly's (2013) discussion of the enclave between India and Bangladesh
describe people who refuse to give up their own status as legitimately
urgent, even in the context of larger scale politics. Similarly, Tyler's
(2013) account of desperate female detainees stripping off their clothes
to expose their humanness and suffering in the Yarl's Wood Immigration
Removal Centre in the UK suggests that demands for recognition are not
just about politics, but also about the acknowledgement of humanness and
the irrevocable possibility of being that which cannot wait. The
continued existence of places like Yarl's Wood and similar institutions
in the USA nonetheless points to the challenge of exposing the urgent
body as a moral priority when it is so easily hidden from view, and also
reminds us that our research can help to explain the relationships
between normative dimensions and the political and social conditions of
struggle. In closing, geographic depictions of waiting do seem to
evocatively describe otherwise obscured suffering (e.g. Bennett, 2011),
but it is striking how rarely these descriptions also use the language
of urgency. Given the discussion above, [what might be accomplished --
and risked -- by incorporating urgency more overtly and deliberately
into our discussions of waiting, surplus and abandoned bodies? Urgency
can clarify the implicit but understated ethical consequences and
normativity associated with waiting, and encourage explicit discussion
about harmful suffering.]{.underline} Waiting can be productive or
unproductive for radical praxis, but urgency compels and requires
response. Geographers could be instrumental in reclaiming the ethical
work of urgency in ways that leave it open for critique, clarifying
common spatial misunderstandings and representations. [There is good
reason to be thoughtful in this process, since moral outrage towards
inhumanity can itself obscure differentiated experiences of being human,
dividing up 'those for whom we feel urgent unreasoned concern and those
whose lives and deaths simply do not touch us, or do not appear as lives
at all']{.underline} (Butler, 2009: 50). [But when the urgent body is
rendered as only waiting, both materially and discursively, it is just
as easily cast as impulsive, disgusting, animalistic]{.underline} (see
also McKittrick, 2006). Feminist theory insists that **[the urgent body,
whose encounters of violence are 'usually framed as private, apolitical
and mundane']{.underline}** (Pain, 2014: 8), **[are as deeply political,
public, and exceptional as other forms of violence]{.underline}**
(Phillips, 2008; Pratt, 2005). **[Insisting that a suffering body, now,
is that which cannot wait, has the ethical effect of drawing it into
consideration alongside the political, public and exceptional scope of
large-scale futures. It may help us insist on the body, both as a single
unit and a plurality, as a legitimate scale of normative priority and
social care.]{.underline}**

#### Reject low probability impacts -- creates serial policy failure.

**Kessler 08** (Oliver, Professor of Sociology at the University of
Bielefeld "From Insecurity to Uncertainty: Risk and the Paradox of
Security Politics" *Alternatives* 33, p. 224-226) NIJ

The problem of the second method is that [it is very difficult to
\"calculate\" politically unacceptable losses. If]{.underline} the
[risk]{.underline} of terrorism [is defined in traditional terms by
probability and potential loss, then the focus on dramatic]{.underline}
terror [attacks leads to the marginalization of probabilities. The
reason is that even the highest degree of improbability becomes
irrelevant as the measure of loss goes to infinity.]{.underline} **[The
mathematical calculation of the risk]{.underline}** of terrorism thus
**[tends to overestimate and to dramatize the danger. This has
consequences beyond the actual risk assessment for the formulation and
execution of \"risk policies\": If one factor of the risk calculation
approaches infinity]{.underline}** (e.g., if a case of nuclear terrorism
is envisaged), **[then there is no balanced measure]{.underline}** for
antiterrorist efforts, **[and risk management as a rational endeavor
breaks down.]{.underline}** Under the historical condition of
bipolarity, [the \"ultimate\" threat with nuclear weapons could be
balanced by a similar counterthreat, and new equilibria could be
achieved, albeit on higher levels of nuclear overkill. Under the new
condition of uncertainty, no such rational balancing is possible since
**knowledge about actors, their motives and capabilities, is largely
absent.**]{.underline} The second form of security policy that emerges
when the deterrence model collapses mirrors the \"social probability\"
approach. [It represents a logic of catastrophe.]{.underline} In
contrast to risk management framed in line with logical probability
theory, [the logic of catastrophe does not attempt to provide means of
absorbing uncertainty. Rather, it takes uncertainty as constitutive for
the logic itself; uncertainty is a crucial precondition for
catastrophies. In particular, catastrophes happen at once, without a
warning, but with major implications for the world polity.]{.underline}
In this category, we find the impact of meteorites. Mars attacks, the
tsunami in South East Asia, and 9/11. To conceive of terrorism as
catastrophe has consequences for the formulation of an adequate security
policy. [Since catastrophes happen irrespectively of human activity or
inactivity, no political action could possibly prevent
them.]{.underline} Of course, [there are precautions that can be taken,
but the framing of]{.underline} terrorist attack as a [catastrophe
points to spatial and temporal characteristics that are beyond
\"rationality.\" Thus, political decision makers are exempted from the
responsibility to provide security---as long as they at least try to
preempt an attack.]{.underline} Interestingly enough, 9/11 was framed as
catastrophe in various commissions dealing with the question of who was
responsible and whether it could have been prevented. [This makes clear
that under the condition of uncertainty, there are no objective criteria
that could serve as an anchor for measuring dangers and assessing the
quality of political responses.]{.underline} For example, **[as much as
one might object to certain measures by the US administration, it is
almost impossible to \"measure\" the success of
countermeasures.]{.underline}** Of course, [there might be a subjective
assessment of specific shortcomings or failures, but there is no
\"common\" currency to evaluate them. As a consequence, the framework of
the security dilemma fails to capture the basic
uncertainties.]{.underline} Pushing the door open for the security
paradox, the main problem of security analysis then becomes the question
how to integrate dangers in risk assessments and security policies about
which simply nothing is known. In the mid 1990s, a Rand study entitled
\"New Challenges for Defense Planning\" addressed this issue arguing
that \"[most striking is the fact that we do not even know who or what
will constitute the most serious future threat, \" In order to cope with
this challenge it would be essential]{.underline}, another Rand
researcher wrote, [to break free from the \"tyranny\" of plausible
scenario planning. The decisive step would be to create \"discontinuous
scenarios \... in which there is no plausible audit trail or storyline
from current events\"]{.underline}52 [These nonstandard scenarios were
later called \"wild cards\" and became important in the current US
strategic discourse.]{.underline} They justified the transformation from
a threat-based toward a capability- based defense planning strategy.53
**[The problem with this kind of risk assessment is]{.underline}**,
however, **[that even the most absurd scenarios can gain plausibility.
By constructing a chain of potentialities, improbable events are linked
and brought into the realm of the possible, if not even the probable.
\"Although the likelihood of the scenario dwindles with each step, the
residual impression is one of plausibility. \"]{.underline}**54 This
so-called Othello effect has been effective in the dawn of the recent
war in Iraq. The connection between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda that the
US government tried to prove was disputed from the very beginning. False
evidence was again and again presented and refuted, but this did not
prevent the administration from presenting as the main rationale for war
the improbable yet possible connection between Iraq and the terrorist
network and the improbable yet possible proliferation of an improbable
yet possible nuclear weapon into the hands of Bin Laden. As Donald
Rumsfeld famously said: \"Absence of evidence is not evidence of
absence.\" This sentence indicates that under the condition of genuine
uncertainty, different evidence criteria prevail than in situations
where security problems can be assessed with relative certainty.

### US Funding Israel

#### The US provides \$3.8 billion to Israel in military aid every year -- this is more than the US gives to the rest of the world combined.

**Kirchick 3/29** (James, Visiting Fellow at the Brookings Institute

[Contrasting the per capita amount received by Israel with that of
"other allies who are as wealthy as Israel," the New York writer Andrew
Sullivan calls the disparity "absurd.]{.underline}" In a piece titled
"Time to Break the Silence on Palestine," the New York Times columnist
[Michelle Alexander decries "the \$38 billion the U.S. government has
pledged in military support to Israel" over the next
decade.]{.underline} (Is there a cause whose advocates are less
silent---in the media, on college campuses, in international fora---than
those of the Palestinians?) Also in The New York Times, [Nathan Thrall
of the International Crisis Group states that Israel receives from
Washington "more military financing than the United States provides to
the rest of the world combined."]{.underline} An organization ominously
named If Americans Knew complains that ["the U.S. provides Israel \$10.5
million in military aid each day, while it gives the Palestinians \$0 in

## Harms

### Occupation Bad -- Genocide

#### Israeli occupation has unequivocally resulted in genocide and multiple human rights violations -- multiple experts confirm. 

**CCR 16** (Center for Constitutional Rights "The Genocide of the
Palestinian People: An International Law and Human Rights Perspective"
<https://ccrjustice.org/genocide-palestinian-people-international-law-and-human-rights-perspective>)
NIJ

Long-Term Military Occupation of Palestinian People When the
international community ratified legal rules that would regulate the
actions of occupying powers while also protecting the rights of occupied
peoples and nations/states, it was understood that military occupation
would be a short-lived necessity attendant to armed conflict, and that
occupying forces would be withdrawn at the end of the conflict.\[19\]
[Israel's prolonged belligerent occupation of the West Bank, including
East Jerusalem, and Gaza for 50 years far exceeds the kind of occupation
that animated the creation of legal rules of occupation contained in
international law. Given the seemingly permanent nature of the Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza,]{.underline} some [human rights
experts]{.underline}, including Israeli historian Ilan Pappé, [have
warned of an "incremental genocide" of Palestinians and the ultimate
destruction of Palestinians as a national group.]{.underline}\[20\]
[This "incremental genocide" through the policies and practices that
have both sustained and served as the hallmarks of Israel's occupation
is accomplished, they argue, by a normalization of the Israeli
annexation of Palestinian territory and the exile or absorption of the
national group of people who identify as Palestinian. International law
is clear that an occupying power may not annex the people or territory
it occupies.]{.underline}\[21\] [The late human rights lawyer and Center
for Constitutional Rights Board President Michael Ratner also charged
Israel with committing "incremental genocide" against the Palestinian
people: "There's no doubt again here this is 'incremental
genocide,']{.underline} as Ilan Pappé says. [It's been going on for a
long time, the killings, the incredibly awful conditions of life, the
expulsions that have gone on from Lydda in 1947 and '48, when 700 or
more villages in Palestine were destroyed, and in the expulsions that
continued from that time until today. It's correct and important to
label it for what it is."]{.underline}\[22\] He argued further, ["I want
to emphasize today \[that\] these killings are part of a broader set of
inhuman acts by Israel constituting international crimes, carried out by
Israel over many years, going back to at least 1947 and 1948. They
include crimes that aren't talked about that much in the media or the
press, the crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, and
apartheid.]{.underline} These crimes can be prosecuted in the
International Criminal Court and are defined there."\[23\] [The Russell
Tribunal on Palestine, a nongovernmental "people's body" made up of
prominent international human rights experts and advocates,]{.underline}
convened between November 2010 and September 2014 to investigate the
question of human rights violations in the context of the Israeli
occupation of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza.\[24\]
It took testimony and deliberated specifically on the question of
whether Israel may have committed genocide in relation to the
Palestinian people. The jury [concluded that some]{.underline} [Israeli
citizens and leaders may have been guilty in several instances of the
separate crime of incitement to genocide]{.underline}, which is
specified in Article 3(c) of the Genocide Convention. ["The cumulative
effect of the long-standing regime of collective punishment in Gaza
appears to inflict conditions of life calculated to bring about the
incremental destruction of the Palestinians as a group in Gaza. The
Tribunal emphasises the potential for a regime of persecution to become
genocidal in effect."]{.underline}\[25\] Military Assaults on Gazan
Population With respect to Israel's most recent military offensive, the
so-called "Operation Protective Edge" launched against Gaza in the
summer of 2014, prominent human rights authorities expressed concern
that the campaign constituted a violation of international humanitarian
law as contained in the Geneva Conventions: [Amnesty International
issued a statement proclaiming "an International Criminal Court (ICC)
investigation is essential to break the culture of impunity which
perpetuates the commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity in
Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The case for such
action is made all the more compelling in the light of the ongoing
serious violations of international humanitarian law being committed by
all parties to the current hostilities in the Gaza Strip and
Israel."]{.underline}\[26\] The ICC has jurisdiction over genocide, and
the U[.N. Special Advisers on the Prevention of Genocide issued a
statement]{.underline} two weeks into the 2014 offensive [that they were
"disturbed by the flagrant use of hate speech in the social media,
particularly against the Palestinian population," finding that
"individuals have disseminated messages that could be dehumanising to
the Palestinians and have called for the killing of members of this
group,"]{.underline} while "remind\[ing\] all that incitement to commit
atrocity crimes is prohibited under international law."\[27\] Al-Haq,
[the oldest Palestinian Human Rights organization, found that serious
violations of international law were committed in the course of the 2014
Israeli offensive against Gaza.]{.underline}\[28\] Al-Haq, along with
other Palestinian human rights organizations the Palestinian Center for
Human Rights, Al-Mezan, and Aldameer, submitted a legal file to the
International Criminal Court urging it to open an investigation and
prosecution into the crimes against humanity and war crimes committed
during the course of Israel's 2014 Gaza offensive.\[29\] The crimes
suggested for prosecution by these human rights organizations include
genocide. [Dozens of Holocaust survivors, together with hundreds of
descendants of Holocaust survivors and victims, accused Israel of
"genocide" for the deaths of more than 2,000 Palestinians in Gaza during
the 2014 Israeli military offensive against Gaza]{.underline},
\"Operation Protective Edge\". \[30\] [Others who have charged that
Israel committed genocide during Operation Cast Lead include Bolivian
President Evo Morales, who recalled that country\'s ambassador from
Israel. He stated, "What is happening in Palestine is
genocide."]{.underline}\[31\] Author and activist Naomi Wolf wrote, "I
mourn genocide in Gaza because I am the granddaughter of a family half
wiped out in a holocaust and I know genocide when I see it."\[32\]
Israeli Government Statements Targeting Palestinians Finally, [prominent
Israeli politicians have publicly called for action against the
Palestinian people that unequivocally meets the definition of genocide
under the 1948 Convention.]{.underline} For instance, in February 2008,
[Matan Vilnai, Israel's deputy defense minister, declared that
increasing tensions between the Israelis and Palestinians in the Gaza
Strip could bring on themselves what he called a shoah, or holocaust,
"The more Qassam \[rocket\] fire intensifies and the rockets reach a
longer range, they will bring upon themselves a bigger shoah because we
will use all our might to defend ourselves."]{.underline}\[33\] [Israeli
Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked posted a statement on Facebook in June
2014 claiming that "the entire Palestinian people is the enemy" and
called for the destruction of Palestine, "including its elderly and its
women, its cities and its villages, its property and its
infrastructure." Her post also called for the killing of Palestinian
mothers who give birth to "little snakes."]{.underline}\[34\] [In August
2014, Moshe Feiglin, then-deputy speaker of the Israeli Knesset and
member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ruling Likud Party, called
for the destruction of Palestinian life in Gaza and offered a detailed
plan for shipping Palestinians living in Gaza across the world.
Specifically, he envisioned a scenario where the Israeli Defense Forces
(IDF) would find areas on the Sinai border to establish "tent
encampments\...until relevant emigration destinations are determined."
He further suggested that the IDF would then "exterminate nests of
resistance, in the event that any should remain."]{.underline}\[35\] [He
subsequently wrote in an op-ed, "After the IDF completes the 'softening'
of the targets with its fire-power, the IDF will conquer the entire
Gaza, using all the means necessary to minimize any harm to our
soldiers, with no other considerations."]{.underline}\[36\] [He
continued, "Gaza is part of our Land and we will remain there forever.
Liberation of parts of our land forever is the only thing that justifies
endangering our soldiers in battle to capture land. Subsequent to the
elimination of terror from Gaza, it will become part of sovereign Israel
and will be populated by Jews. This will also serve to ease the housing
crisis in Israel. The coastal train line will be extended, as soon as
possible, to reach the entire length of Gaza."]{.underline} Conclusion
**[Prominent human rights advocates and scholars have argued that the
killings of Palestinians and their forceful expulsion from mandate
Palestine in 1948, the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, East
Jerusalem, and Gaza, and the violence and discrimination directed at
Palestinians by the Israeli government have violated a number of human
rights protections contained in international human rights law, genocide
being among them.]{.underline}**

### Occupation Bad -- Global Settler Colonialism

#### The West Bank is the laboratory for territorial and urban conflict globally -- Contesting settler colonial violence there is key.

**Lloyd & Wolfe 15** (David, Distinguished Professor of English at the
University of California, Riverside; Patrick, Australian Anthropologist
and Ethnographer "Settler Colonial Logics and the Neoliberal Regime"
*Settler Colonial Studies* DOI: 10.1080/2201473X.2015.1035361) NIJ

[In this asymmetrical warfare of the entitled against the
disenfranchised, the deadly if preposterous situation emerges that the
most highly armed states in the world assure their populations that they
(or their interests) are under a permanent state of siege, diffusely
threatened by ragtag platoons of the dispossessed who, despite the
considerable differences between them, uniformly qualify for the
indiscriminate designation 'terrorists'.]{.underline} To note this is
neither to endorse the kaleidoscopic variety of ideologies and religious
beliefs that motivate such groups, nor to collapse into a single
framework of resistance the very diverse phenomena they represent. [It
is, rather, to problematize a narrative that, for over a decade, has
legitimated the violent rise of the neoliberal state, with its
multiplying encroachments on the civil liberties that were, at least in
name, the hallmark of liberalism; its endless conduct of war in the name
of peace and freedom; its inhuman treatment of refugees and asylum
seekers internationally; its infliction of austerity, incarceration and
police brutality on growing segments of its populations domestically;
and its arbitrary and lethal interventions globally in the name of
humanitarianism. From the hard right to the liberal center, from the
faux frontier bluster of George W. Bush to the moralizing condescension
of Barack Obama, the same rhetoric of defensive and pre-emptive action
against enemies that externally surround or internally infest the nation
reigns.]{.underline} At the same time, anti-immigrant scare-mongering
conflates migrants, whether driven by economic or political necessities,
with terrorist enemies, militarizing the borders of states in the name
of security. **[Never has Walter Benjamin's aphorism that, from the
perspective of the oppressed, 'the "state of emergency" in which we live
is not the exception but the rule']{.underline}** 2 **[seemed to express
so general a condition.]{.underline}** It is highly significant that the
distinctive characteristics of this emergent global regime have been
locally prefigured in modes of repression developed internally by
settler colonial states. **[As Israeli architect and specialist on urban
warfare, Eyal Weizman, has argued, for instance, the West Bank can be
seen as an extreme model -- perhaps a laboratory -- of a territorial and
urban conflict that can take place in other places.]{.underline}**
Globalization takes the periphery straight to the center, the frontier
between the First and Third worlds starts running through the middle of
world cities.3 [Weizmann's phrasing signals a genealogy for contemporary
transformations in the longer history of colonialism as a repertoire of
both tropes and practices of social control, brought together today in
Israel's operations as a settler colonial state, anomalous only in that
its project of expansion remains unfinished.4 The notable convergence of
Israel and the USA (together with an ever-compliant Australia),
expressed as much in their political solidarity as in their military and
security collaborations, suggests to us a wider historical affinity
between states that share a settler colonial history, one that continues
to impress itself on both psychic and institutional
formations.]{.underline} In this respect, to Weizmann's invocation of
the first and third worlds, we should add the histories of dispossession
and resistance through which Indigenous peoples of the 'fourth world'
have shaped our understanding of the dynamics of settler colonialism and
its lessons for the present. [We suggest that the fundamental continuity
between the historical development of European settler colonialism and
the present-day development of the neoliberal world order resides in the
exigencies of managing surplus populations. So far as settlers have been
concerned, the salient surplus has, of course, been the Native
population, whose refractory presence has prompted a range of techniques
of elimination -- from outright homicide to various forms of removal
and/ or confinement, and, once their numbers have been appropriately
reduced in the post-frontier era, to Natives' assimilation into settler
society -- techniques that have met with mixed success in the face of
Native modes of resistance which have varied as creatively as the
settlers' own repertoire of strategies.]{.underline} In this overall
historical process, the key shift is the ending of the frontier, which
generally coincides with the consolidation of the settler state, and
which is typically marked by intensified programs of Native
assimilation, so many mopping-up exercises for civilization. [Thus it is
consistent that Israel, which remains bogged down in an incomplete
expansion of its frontier, should rigorously eschew any semblance of
Native assimilation, insisting instead on the sharpest of distinctions
between Palestinians, who may or may not be citizen/residents of the
Israeli state, and members of the so-called 'Jewish nation' wherever
they may live. The exclusion of the Palestinian population is
particularly apparent in the ease with which shifting economic and
demographic circumstances -- especially the large-scale immigration of
Arab-Jews (Mizrahim) and Russians -- have transformed what was once a
reserve Palestinian labor force into a largely unemployed surplus.
Bereft of potential productive utility, and with pauperization
attenuating its value as a market, the Palestinian population has become
subject to policies of removal and confinement that recall those adopted
by other settler states while the expansion of their frontiers remained
incomplete.]{.underline}

### Solvency -- Cutting Funds Solves

#### Ending funds solves---Occupation is only sustainable because of US support.

**Bennis 16** (Phyllis, Fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies and
Director of the New Internationalism Project "Record \$38 Billion in
Military Aid to Israel is a 'Statement of Absolute Support' for Israeli
Occupation"
<https://ips-dc.org/record-38-billion-military-aid-israel-statement-absolute-support-israeli-occupation/>)
NIJ

["The package is again a statement of absolute support for Israeli
occupation, colonization, and apartheid," Phyllis Bennis told the Real
News Network in response to the \$38 billion package of U.S. military
aid promised to Israel.]{.underline} Bennis said [this deal is not about
Israeli defenses.]{.underline} The Obama administration has said that
**[Israeli's occupation of Palestine is not sustainable. But it becomes
sustainable]{.underline}**, Bennis said, **[when the U.S. finances
billions in American tax dollars]{.underline}**, "more than has been
given to any other country for military assistance, including even Iraq
in the ten years of the Iraq War, from 2003 to 2011." Bennis called the
amount of money "outrageous," for the 23rd wealtlhiest country in the
world. She also said that to call the stipulation that Israel must spend
some of the aid on the U.S. war industry rather than building their own
a concession "simply doesn't stand up," as that standard applies to all
of the other countries the U.S. provides aid to. [As for the provision
that Israel is not to ask for more money unless there's an
emergency]{.underline}, Bennis said, "As we know, [Israel creates the
emergencies. Israel is the one who goes to war against Gaza and then
demands that the U.S. send more bullets when they use them up, or more
planes or more bombs.]{.underline}" Independent journalist Rania Khalek
said it's "stunning" that Israel is prioritized over the interests of
Americans during a time when "our government seems to be incapable of
providing basic services in parts of this country, like clean drinking
water and like functioning schools." ["We're able to always come up with
this money to spend to not only enable but literally fund Israel's
ongoing destruction of Palestinian families and
communities,"]{.underline} Khalek said. This comes at a time when,
Khalek said, **[the current Israeli government is the most racist
government that's been elected in Israel's history. She said government
officials have called for beheadings of disloyal Palestinians, "ISIS
language," and slaughtering mothers in their beds to prevent them from
birthing 'little snakes,' "the language of genocide." "We're arming this
government and giving them the weapons they need to commit absolute
savagery against a totally defenseless population,"]{.underline}**
Khalek said. Bennis says Obama is "seriously misreading" where the
American people are on the Palestinian question. "The public discourse
on this question has shifted," she said. ["There is massive opposition
to Israeli actions in the United States today, particularly importantly
in the Jewish community, where there's been an enormous shift in that
discourse."]{.underline} Obama has had public confrontations with
Netanyahu, Bennis explained, but [if the administration continues to
give billions in military aid every year to Israel, and continue to
"provide absolute impunity at the United Nations, using their veto or a
threat of veto or a threat of other punishments to make sure that Israel
is never held accountable for its potential war crimes, that's what
matters in the U.S.-Israeli relationship, and all the rest is just
words."]{.underline}

#### Ending funds solves -- US funds empower Israel both politically and militaristically to commit atrocities. US funds alone account for 1/5^th^ of Israel's defense budget.

**Marcetic 4/19** (Branko, Jacobin Staff Writer "AOC Is Right About Aid
to Israel"
<https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/04/ocasio-cortez-israel-aid-united-states>)
NIJ

For one thing, [US military aid to Israel is already supposed to be
illegal under the]{.underline} so-called [Leahy Laws. Those laws bar the
US government from giving training, equipment, and other types of
assistance to any overseas security forces committing "gross violations
of human rights,"]{.underline} which include torture and extrajudicial
killing. There is copious evidence of [the Israeli military routinely
killing protesters]{.underline}, including teenagers and medics ---
often from sniper positions hundreds of feet away --- despite the
plethora of nonlethal, high-tech options it has to repel demonstrators.
[One could go further back and cite the Israeli military's
indiscriminate bombing and shelling of Gaza, or the frequent reports of
Israeli torture of Palestinians, documented by the United Nations and
other organizations.]{.underline} But the recent sniper killings alone
are sufficient. But forget about the rule of law. Even by the warped
moral standards of Washington, D.C., [Israel has crossed a red
line]{.underline}, with [the UN determining this past February that
Israeli forces had killed and wounded clearly marked journalists and
medics during last year's Gaza protests.]{.underline} Saudi Arabia
killing a single journalist last year was considered so shocking and
outrageous that its government received months of well-deserved
condemnation, including from many who had previously been enthusiastic
supporters of the Kingdom, leading to Congress's historic attempt to end
US support for the country's war in Yemen. Unless the argument is Saudi
Arabia would have been on solid ground if it had simply murdered Jamal
Khashoggi by sniper fire, this is clearly a double standard. Then
there's the political element. [Even a committed liberal Zionist would
have to admit the direction of Israeli politics is now entering scary
new territory. To win the most recent election, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu teamed up with far-right ultranationalists]{.underline} who
are so toxic, even AIPAC --- AIPAC! --- condemned the alliance and
refuses to meet with them. [Netanyahu has spent the past few years
cozying up to far-right, racist governments in Europe, drumming up
hatred domestically, and trying to centralize power.]{.underline} Even
Beto O'Rourke, who seems pathologically unwilling to articulate and
stick to a political position, has called him "racist." [That's not even
to mention the most central criticism of Israel: its decades-long
subjugation of the Palestinian people, its flouting of the international
peace process, and its continued violation of international law in
regard to the conflict. **If Americans are alarmed by Israel's
actions**]{.underline} --- be they the killing and abuse of innocent
people, targeting of journalists, drift towards the global far right, or
treatment of Palestinians --- **[they have a relatively straightforward
piece of leverage they can use to seek to change its behavior: the
billions of dollars of military and economic aid the US government sends
to Israel every year, which has made the country the largest cumulative
recipient of US foreign assistance since the Second World War and
accounts for nearly one-fifth of the country's defense budget. There is
no other country on the planet that has this kind of arrangement, let
alone an apartheid state that is openly vying to become a member of a
far-right, authoritarian international alliance.]{.underline}** One of
the most pathetic moments in the history of US leadership took place in
2016. After Netanyahu spent years ignoring Obama's calls to halt illegal
settlements, quietly tried to get his opponent elected in 2012, and made
an unprecedented, widely criticized speech to Congress that he never
bothered to clear with the president, in an effort to derail his foreign
policy, Obama punished Israel by ... negotiating the largest military
aid deal in US history with the country. Why on earth would Israel ever
change its behavior when its leaders have been conditioned to understand
it won't be punished by any member of the US political class, and may in
fact be rewarded? So yes, cutting or outright withdrawing aid to Israel
should be "on the table" --- to say the least. [Decades of unflinching
financial support for Israel no matter what atrocity it commits or norm
it violates has given its leaders the completely correct belief they can
do anything they want without consequence. It's time to prove them
wrong.]{.underline}

## Framing

### Framing -- Structural Violence 🡪 Extinction

#### Settler colonialism is a driver of extinction---it must be prioritized.

**Mitchell 17** (Audra, Canada Research Chair in Global Political
Ecology at Wilfrid Laurier University "Decolonizing Against Extinction
Part I: Extinction Is Violence"
<https://worldlyir.wordpress.com/2017/07/28/decolonizing-against-extinction-part-i-extinction-is-violence/>)
NIJ

['Structural violence' involves systemic forms of harm, exclusion and
discrimination that disproportionately affect particular groups, and
which can take many forms (physical, psychological, economic, gendered
and others). They are embedded in and expressed through political,
cultural, economic and social structures]{.underline} (Farmer 2009)
[that can persist across large spans of time and space. I use the term
'transversal' to refer to forms of structural violence that extend
across multiple boundaries]{.underline} -- not only those of
nation-states, but also other kinds of nations (human and otherwise),
communities or kinship groups, and temporalities. [Prime examples of
transversal structural violence include: settler
colonialism]{.underline}, colonial genocides (Woolford et al 2014);
environmental racism or 'slow violence', including toxification and
pollution; and complexes of sexual, physical, communal, spiritual and
land-based violence associated with the extractive industries. Each of
[these forms of violence is ecologically devastating, and their
convergence in European projects of colonisation is even more so. Many
formations of transversal structural violence are significant causes of
the so-called 'four horsemen' of extinction]{.underline} mentioned
above. For instance, ['direct killing' is carried out to clear land for
settlement, and it occurs as a result of ecological damage caused by
resource extraction. Settler colonialism, carbon-based economies and
regimes of environmental racism also support forms of socio-economic
organization]{.underline} (for instance, carbon and energy-intensive
urbanized societies) [that intensify climate change and increase habitat
destruction. Meanwhile, colonization has played a significant role in
the ongoing transfer of life forms across the planet -- whether
unintentionally]{.underline} (e.g. the transfer of fish in the bilge
water of ships); [as an instrument of agricultural
settlement]{.underline} (e.g. cattle ranching), [or as a deliberate
strategy of violence]{.underline} (e.g. smallpox). However,
**[transversal structural violence is a driver of extinction in
itself]{.underline}**, with its own distinct manifestations. [First, it
involves the disruption or severance of relations and kinship structures
between human communities and other life forms, and the dissolution of
Indigenous systems of governance, laws and protocols that have
co-created and sustained plural worlds over millennia]{.underline}
(Borrows 2010; Atleo 2012; Kimmerer 2013). [Second, the destruction of
Indigenous knowledges through policies of assimilation, expropriation,
cultural appropriation and other strategies undermines these forms of
order and the relationships they nurture. Third, the displacement of
and/or restricted access to land by Indigenous peoples interferes with
practices of caring for land or Country that are necessary for the
survival of humans and other life forms]{.underline} (Bawaka Country
2015). [Colonial genocides embody all of these forms of destruction by
killing or displacing Indigenous communities, undermining Indigenous
modes of governance and kinship systems, systematically destroying
relationships between life forms and erasing knowledge. All of these
modes of violence weaken co-constitutive relationships between
Indigenous communities, other life forms and ecosystems that have
enabled their collaborative survival.]{.underline} This results in
disruptions to ecosystems -- and climate -- that Potawatomi scholar Kyle
Powys Whyte (2016) has recently argued would have been considered a
dystopia by his Ancestors. **[In other words, transversal structural
violence, and colonial violence in particular, are fundamental drivers
of global patterns of extinction.]{.underline}** It stands to reason,
then, that responses to extinction that focus on managing endangered
species or populations, or 'backing up' genetic material, are
insufficient: they leave the structures of violence intact and may add
to their power. Instead, [efforts to address extinction need to focus on
identifying, confronting and dismantling these formations of violence,
and on restoring or strengthening the relations they sever.]{.underline}
Yet responses to global patterns of extinction are overwhelmingly rooted
in Western scientific concepts of conservation -- a paradigm that
emerged within 20th century European colonial government structures
(Adams 2004). Contemporary conservation approaches -- from the creation
of land and marine parks to the archiving of genetic materials -- may
exacerbate the destruction of relations between Indigenous peoples and
their relations. For instance, conservation strategies often involve
displacing Indigenous peoples from the land that they care for (Jago
2017, Brockington and Igoe 2006), or curtailing of processes such as
subsistence hunting, fishing or burning that have enabled the
co-survival of Indigenous groups, plants, animals and land for
millennia. Meanwhile, ex situ and genetic forms of conservation
(including zoos and gene banks) may violate these relationships by
instrumentalizing or commodifying kinship relations. Increasingly
popular conservation approaches based on Traditional Ecological
Knowledge (TEK) approaches claim to center Indigenous communities and
knowledges. However, they ultimately instrumentalize fragments of
Indigenous knowledge systems (for instance, data on climatic change) to
test or support Western approaches. As such, they leave the structures
of colonization and other forms of transversal structural violence
untouched, and may even exacerbate them. [All of this suggests that
confronting global patterns of extinction calls for decolonization and
other ethos that work to eliminate transversal structural
violence]{.underline} -- and I don't mean this metaphorically. Enabling
the restoration of relations that can enable the ongoing flourishing of
life on earth will require the transfer of land and power back into
plural Indigenous peoples and their distinct modes of sovereignty, law
and governance (Tuck and Yang 2012). These relationships and forms of
order have enabled plural Indigenous peoples and their multitude of
relations to co-flourish for millennia, including through periods of
rapid climate change, and they are needed to ensure the continuation of
this co-flourishing. [This means that decolonization is not simply
related to global patterns of extinction: it is necessary to ensuring
the ongoingness of plural life forms on earth.]{.underline}

In an effort to address violence as a global public health problem, the
World Health Organization (WHO), developed a typology (Krug et al. 2002)
that focuses on [a]{.underline} (p. 53) "[minimalist" notion of violence
as direct and physical force]{.underline}, with no mention of structural
violence despite recognizing poverty as an important risk factor in all
kinds of violence (Bufacchi 2007:23; Perry 2009:377). As this example
illustrates, typologies of violence, while useful (Rutherford et al.
2007), [can lead to narrow conceptualizations of social
issues]{.underline}. In addition, within real-life contexts, such
categories are fluid and not so easily delineated. For example, in their
discussion of how [interpersonal physical violence]{.underline} becomes
a routine part of everyday urban life for vulnerable and marginalized
groups, Singer and Erickson (2011a) identify the subsets of "street
violence" and "private violence," subcategories that often overlap or
merge. Rape, especially gang rape, can be a form of street violence but
most often (certainly in the United States) occurs out of public view.
In both instances it [is often linked to structural factors, such as
poverty and gender inequality, and to sociocultural meanings ascribed to
women and their bodies. Rape can also be political violence when used
systematically as a weapon of aggression or war]{.underline} (Stark and
Wessells 2012), and its consequences often lead to increased structural
violence. [The global distribution of the AIDS epidemic, for example, is
determined to a large degree by structural violence and "rape is a major
factor driving the AIDS epidemic]{.underline}" (Mukherjee 2007:117). In
such circumstances, [rape encompasses several kinds of violence, with
roots well established in "peacetime meanings of sexuality]{.underline}"
(Olujic 1998b:33). Similarly, in the context of refugee and IDP
(internally displaced persons) camps, rape may have all of these
connotations and be a manifestation of structural violence, since it
goes largely unreported and is often dismissed by humanitarian
organizations and their staff as an "unfortunate" part of the refugee
context (Whiteford 2009). [This complex relationship between direct and
structural violence was noted]{.underline} over 150 years ago [by German
physician and anthropologist Rudoph Virchow, who wrote that "war, plague
and famine condition each other]{.underline}" (cited in Rather
1985:115). There is ample evidence that war and political violence have
grave impacts on the health and well-being of individuals, communities,
and nations---beyond the immediacy of conflict-induced injury and death
(Geneva Declaration Secretariat 2008; Levy and Sidel 2008; Pedersen
2002; Taipale et al. 2002). Anthropologists, in particular, have shown
that war and conflict not only affect infrastructures supporting local
health care, education, markets, and farming activities, but also
disrupt families and community support systems, damage the environment,
interrupt means of livelihood, and displace populations (Leatherman and
Thomas 2008; Rylko-Bauer and Singer 2010; Rylko-Bauer, Whiteford, and
Farmer 2009; Singer and Hodge 2010). These [impacts are often mediated
by preexisting forms of structural violence which, in the aftermath of
conflict, contribute to even greater levels of poverty, political
marginalization, and racism]{.underline} (Fassin 2009; Miller and
Rasmussen 2010; Nordstrom 2004; Panter-Brick 2010; Quesada 2009).
Moreover, these consequences often have a long half-life (Becker,
Beyene, and Ken 2000; Das 2007; Johnston 2007, 2011; Johnston and Barker
2008). [Women are especially victimized by multiple forms of violence,
which often interact and are shaped by both gendered dimensions of
conflict and preexisting gender discrimination]{.underline} (Annan and
Brier 2010). And children are (p. 54) particularly vulnerable, but the
"costs \[they\] pay for the actions of war and its devastating aftermath
... are often neglected" (Quesada 1998:64--65; see also Kent 2006;
McEvoy-Levy 2001; Nordstrom 2009; Olujic 1998a). [Structural violence,
in turn, contributes in complex ways to the preconditions for explosive
direct violence]{.underline} (Bonnefoy, Burgat, and Menoret 2011;
Rylko-Bauer and Singer 2010; Rylko-Bauer et al. 2009; Singer and Hodge
2010). [Armed conflict is more likely in low to middle-income countries
with slower economic growth, greater gaps in income and resource
distribution, and high rates of poverty, hunger, and poor
health]{.underline} (Krug et al. 2002; Pinstrup-Andersen and Shimokawa
2008; Stewart 2002). Structural violence has even been examined as a
form of genocide (Ahmed 2007; Lewy 2007). Rwanda is a compelling
example. Decades of colonial and imperialist exploitation, coupled with
the construction of ethnic difference, laid the groundwork for the
explosive violence of 1994 (Farmer 2009). Western development aid
ignored structural inequities and human rights violations, thus
contributing to already existing poverty, unequal distribution of land
and resources, social exclusion, and class divisions---so that by "the
1990s, the interaction between structural violence and racism created
the conditions for genocidal manipulation by the elites" (Uvin 1999:54).
Several models have been proposed for exploring how [both direct and
indirect violence serve as precursors to collective physical
violence]{.underline} (De Jong 2010). One example is the notion of [a
continuum of violence]{.underline} (Scheper-Hughes 1996, 2007;
Scheper-Hughes and Bourgois 2004), [based on the recognition that social
tolerance of "everyday" structural violence, and the humiliation that
accompanies it, sets the stage for normalization of more overt and
visible forms, from police brutality and state-directed political
violence to massacres and genocides]{.underline} (Scheper-Hughes 1996;
Uvin 1999). This is particularly applicable to Latin America where there
has been a shift from the brutal political violence of the latter
twentieth century to the more recent growth in criminal and
interpersonal violence (Briceño-León and Zubillaga 2002; Sanchez 2006).
These rates correlate with lower levels of development and higher income
inequality within the region (Bliss 2010; United Nations Office on Drugs
and Crime 2011). While conventional analyses link these trends to drug
trafficking, gang membership, readily available firearms, and a weak
criminal justice system (World Bank 2011), a number of anthropologists
see a deeper link with the past (Bourgois 2001; Heggenhougen 2009; Manz
2009; Metz, Mariano, and García 2010), a "continuum of violence spanning
the civil war years to the present ... \[the\] outcome of a history of
structural violence, gender norms, and political repression" as well as
racism directed against indigenous populations (Bourgois 2009:36).
Layered upon this legacy of political violence is the more recent
"structural violence \[of\] rampant economic inequality, social
exclusion, and persistent poverty arising from the imposition of
neoliberal economic policies," namely structural adjustment programs
linked to development aid and unfair international trade agreements
(Sanchez 2006:179; Quesada 2009). Similar processes in other parts of
the Global South have exacerbated the poverty, dislocation, and lack of
jobs in the (p. 55) formal economy that serve "as a trigger" for growing
rates of "reactive" social and criminal violence (Winton 2004:166--67).
Understanding Invisible Violence Structural violence is only one among
several forms of less visible violence that are interconnected in
complex ways. Anthropologist Philippe Bourgois (2009) has proposed a
conceptual framework for critically examining how [the invisible
processes of structural, as well as symbolic, and normalized violence
are linked across time and space to various kinds of direct violence. A
central element in all three concepts is the normalization of unequal
power relations. Symbolic violence]{.underline} is associated with
sociologist Pierre Bourdieu (2000) and [refers to sociocultural
mechanisms and relations of unequal power and domination that exist
within interpersonal relationships and in other spheres of
life]{.underline}. It is [embedded in ordinary daily life, manifested
through language, symbolism, and actions that are perceived by both
perpetrator and victim as normal or deserved]{.underline}, a legitimate
and inevitable part of the natural social order. "Symbolic violence is
... so powerful precisely because it is unrecognizable for what it is."
Its power "rests precisely in its lack of visibility---in the fact that
for those exposed to it the doubts and the fear engendered by it cause
them to question themselves" (Morgan and Björkert 2006:448). A classic
example is that of intimate partner violence, where women blame
themselves and are blamed by others for the violence perpetrated against
them. Symbolic violence harms both psychologically and emotionally and
is often used to justify everyday interpersonal and structural violence,
as Simić and Rhodes (2009) demonstrate in their study of street sex
workers in Serbia. Similarly, in his research of Puerto Rican crack
dealers in New York's East Harlem, Bourgois (2003) shows how [structural
and symbolic violence interact and set conditions for the everyday
interpersonal conflicts]{.underline} "that the socially vulnerable
inflict mainly onto themselves (via substance abuse), onto their kin and
friends (through domestic violence and adolescent gang rape), and onto
their neighbors and community" (Bourgois 2001:11). The normalized
violence that Bourgois (2001, 2009) refers to is an adaptation of the
concept of everyday violence initially developed by Scheper-Hughes
(1992) to highlight the extreme poverty and high infant and child
mortality that characterized life in Brazilian shantytowns. She later
applied this concept to life circumstances affecting other socially
marginalized people, such as Brazilian and South African street youth or
the elderly in U.S. nursing homes (Scheper-Hughes 1996, 2007). The
concept of [normalized violence recognizes the indifference in broader
society and identifies mechanisms by which violence becomes an
inevitable part of daily life for its victims]{.underline}. For example,
in his life history of a street drug addict named Tony, Merrill Singer
(2006:72) observes that "the threat of violence---emotional and
physical---daily preparation for violence on the street, and enduring
the agony of violence-inflicted (p. 56) pain were all commonplace to
\[Tony\] as an integral part of the world of street drug use and sales.
He had come to accept violence as he had bad weather, harsh but
unavoidable." Some scholars have called for more detailed and nuanced
analysis. For example, in examining the "routinization of political
violence as a social violence of the everyday" in communist China,
Kleinman (2000:235) concludes that we should pay closer attention to the
"multiplicity of violences of everyday life" across classes of people
and social contexts, each with "different histories, sustained by
different social dynamics," and varied "outcome\[s\]‌ in trauma and
suffering."

### Framing -- Risk-Analysis Bad

#### Shoddy link-chains become the very logic of post-9/11 insecurity---this justifies preemption and becomes the cause of crisis itself.

**Stockdale 16** (Liam, Contract and Sessional Faculty at the Institute
on Globalization & the Human Condition at McMaster University
"Catastrophic Futures, Precarious Presents, and the Temporal Politics of
(In)security" in *Time, Temporality, and Global Politics*, p. 178-179)
NIJ

Looking at this trend from a wider perspective, it can be usefully
understood as a function of broader shifts in the way the present and
future are framed in the contemporary global security imagination. In
this respect, [the present is construed as beset by a radical
contingency, with the global security environment in particular
characterised by the breakdown of established certainties in the face of
novel threats]{.underline} (Kessler and Daase 2008). [The consequence is
that 'decision-makers are simply no longer able to guarantee
predictability, security, and control' to the extent that was once
believed possible]{.underline} (Aradau and van Munster 2008: 23).
Complementary to this framing of the present, [the future is understood
in terms not just of radical uncertainty but of 'expected and undeniable
catastrophe', typified by the proverbial next attack, with the precise
moment of its emergence remaining continually unknown]{.underline}
(Ibid.). In other words, [the future embodies an impending catastrophe
that is seemingly both inevitable---in that it will at some point
occur---and unknowable---in that we cannot be certain when it will take
place]{.underline} (Anderson 2010a: 779-80; Opitz and Tellmann 2015:
107). **[What]{.underline}** more broadly **[results is]{.underline}**
what Paul Virilio has termed **['a culture of the imminence of
disaster']{.underline}** (2010: 7), **[in which]{.underline}**---to wax
Rumsfeldian---[**contemporary life is haunted by the spectre of a
disastrous unknown that is paradoxically known to be lurking in the
future's unknowable depths.** Approaches premised upon taming these
uncertainties by controlling the unfolding of the future through
anticipatory interventions in the present have accordingly come to
dominate the post-9/11 global politics of (in)security.]{.underline} In
practice, [this perspective implies the necessity of acting
pre-emptively, even without an established base of verifiable knowledge
upon which to make such decisions]{.underline} (Aradau and van Munster
2007: 101). In other words, **[radical uncertainty about both the nature
of the threat and the moment at which it might emerge is not an
impediment to acting anticipatorily; it instead provides the very
impetus for it, such that 'the absence of specific evidence serves as
justification for action']{.underline}** (Elmer and Opel 2006: 481).
[This places governing authorities 'in the uncomfortable position of
having to take drastic action in the face of an inescapably elusive,
uncertain threat']{.underline} (Cooper 2006: 119).

# A2: Amend CP

## A2: Solvency

### No Solvency -- Refuse to Trace

#### Amendment doesn't solve -- It's not a question of legal trappings, the US lacks the political will to enforce any checks on Israel.

**Kane 19** (Alex, Journalist for In These Times "Inside Sources Say the
State Dept Refuses To Trace Whether Israel Is Using U.S. Military Aid
Illegally"
<http://inthesetimes.com/features/israel-palestine-killings-us-aid-military-weapons.html>)
NIJ

It's not supposed to be this way. U.S. arms exports to Israel (and other
countries) are governed by laws placing restrictions on sales to nations
that abuse human rights. [Campaigns to cut U.S. military aid to Israel
have latched onto a particular measure, known as the Leahy Law. The law
prohibits U.S. assistance or training from flowing to foreign military
units that have committed a gross violation of human rights, unless the
foreign government has held that unit accountable. But interviews with
human rights advocates, congressional aides and former and current U.S.
officials reveal that **enforcement of the Leahy Law in Israel is lax,
with no tracking of which army units receive U.S. weapons. Human rights
advocates say they have brought the State Department evidence of
specific crimes committed by soldiers who clearly used U.S. weapons,
only to have that evidence brushed off.**]{.underline} A current U.S.
official, who asked for anonymity because they are not authorized to
speak to the press and could be fired as a result, told In These Times
that they are not aware of any time when an Israeli unit was cut off
from U.S. assistance under the Leahy Law. [This lack of enforcement
allows Israel to get away with extrajudicial executions of
Palestinians]{.underline}, human rights advocates say. Maria LaHood,
deputy legal director at the Center for Constitutional Rights, says [the
United States' "unparalleled support for Israel" gives it leverage to
end these extrajudicial killings if it chooses. "Our government does not
lack the legal tools to put an end to Israel's human rights
violations,"]{.underline} she says. **["It lacks the political
will."]{.underline}**

### A2: Solves Stability

#### Arms sales to Israel paves the way for Israeli weapons exports -- causes ME instability

**BADILLIO 19**-research analyst at Canadians for Justice and Peace in
the Middle East based in Montreal, Quebec. She holds an M.Phil from
Trinity College Dublin, in International Peace Studies. Anna is a social
justice activist and human rights advocate with a focuses on
Palestinian-Israeli affairs and international law \[Anna, "The US-Israel
'special relationship' subsidizes American military industry and Israeli
colonialism,"
4/9/2019, <https://thedefensepost.com/2019/04/09/us-israel-arms-sales-opinion/,> DKP\]

By the 2000s, the Israeli military-industrial complex had produced an
industry capable of competing in small-arms and high-end security
technology on a worldwide scale. Israel started to export arms that have
been refined through high-technology colonial policing of the
Palestinian population, especially in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
[In recent years, Israel has risen to one of the top 10 arms exporters
in the world.]{.underline} Last May Haaretz reported, ["Israel's
defense-related exports in 2017 totalled \$9.2 billion, an all-time
record and whooping 40% increase over 2016 -- when defense-related
transactions totaled \$6.5 billion." The Obama administration
adjustments to Israel's military aid package came amidst a shifting
geopolitical environment, both within the U.S. and Israel. There was a
shift in original MOU that would slowly phase out the provisions through
which Israel could spend up to 26% of its funding package within Israel,
to Israel spending more of this funding on the advanced military
capabilities that only the United States can provide -- as much as \$1.2
billion per year]{.underline}, according to Ajl. In addition, [this MOU
locked in \$500 million annually for missile defense. The MOU mandates
Israel update its fighter aircraft fleet, which is a direct investment
into the U.S. military-industrial complex, given that fighter-jet
factories are exclusively based in the United States.]{.underline} Not
only does U.S. foreign policy and Israeli-settler colonialism shape what
happens across historic Palestine, it also shapes what happens across
the Middle East region. [The firm establishment of Israel's military
defense industry also provides an excuse to sell ever-more-sophisticated
weapons to other regional U.S. allies, especially Saudi Arabia. As long
as Israel has the latest U.S. technology, other countries can buy older
models, again to the great profit of the U.S. defense industry. Israel
thus is the spark plug for an entire region-wide weapons bazaar, while
also providing such countries the means to destroy and dismantle even
poorer countries like Yemen. **This keeps the entire region
aflame**]{.underline}, oppressed and desperate, and thus unlikely to
upset hierarchical regional and international social structures. Ajl
suggests that one of reasons the United States pushed through this MOU
before Obama left office is the rising discontent within the U.S.
population over ongoing support for Israeli colonization of historic
Palestine and the surrounding region.

# A2: Israel Strikes

States provides Israel, \"it will still never be enough to safeguard
against \[an Iranian\] nuclear attack.\"]{.underline}**162 **[In the
past, Israel has been wary of its regional rivals\' pursuit of nuclear
capabilities because nuclear weapons pose a mortal threat to the Jewish
state.]{.underline}**163 Israel has shown a willingness to address
threats by \"us\[ing\] force to protect nationals abroad, tak\[ing\]
anticipatory self-defense, and respond\[ing\] to terrorism as part of
self-defense.\"164 In 1985, Israel carried out an attack against the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) headquarters in Tunisia using
U.S.-supplied aircrafts.165 **[Israel also shows a willingness to use
force to specifically address nuclear threats.]{.underline}** As
previously mentioned, in 1981, Israel attacked an Iraqi nuclear reactor
using U.S.- made F-15 and F-16 planes.166 In addition, Israel carried
out an airstrike against a Syrian facility in 2007, which it identified
as a nuclear reactor.167

achievement of his predecessor Barack Obama, isolating the United States
from its Western allies and sowing uncertainty before a risky nuclear
negotiation with North Korea. The decision, while long anticipated and
widely telegraphed, leaves the [2015
agreement](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-is-reached-after-long-negotiations.html?module=inline)
reached by seven countries after more than two years of grueling
negotiations in tatters. **[The United States will now reimpose the

considering new penalties.
[Iran](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-revolutionary-guard-corps.html?module=inline)
said it will remain in the deal, which tightly restricted its nuclear
ambitions for a decade or more in return for ending the sanctions that
had crippled its economy.]{.underline}** So did France, Germany and
Britain, raising the prospect of a trans-Atlantic clash as European
companies face the return of American sanctions for doing business with
Iran. China and Russia, also signatories to the deal, are likely to join
Iran in accusing the United States of violating the accord. Mr. Trump's
move could embolden hard-line forces in Iran, raising the threat of
Iranian retaliation against Israel or the United States, fueling an arms
race in the Middle East and fanning sectarian conflicts from Syria to
Yemen. **[The president, however, framed his decision as the fulfillment
of a bedrock campaign promise and as the act of a dealmaker dissolving a
fatally flawed agreement]{.underline}**. He predicted his tough line
with Iran would strengthen his hand as he prepared to meet North Korea's
leader, Kim Jong-un, to begin negotiating the surrender of his nuclear
arsenal. "This was a horrible one-sided deal that should have never,
ever been made," a grim-faced Mr. Trump said in an 11-minute address
from the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House. "It didn't bring
calm, it didn't bring peace, and it never will." \[Read the full

[Mr.
Trump's](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-revolutionary-guard-corps.html?module=inline)
announcement drew a chorus of opposition from European leaders, several
of whom lobbied him feverishly not to pull out of the agreement and
searched for fixes to it that would satisfy him. It also drew a rare
public rebuke by Mr. Obama, who said Mr. Trump's withdrawal would leave
the world less safe, confronting it with "a losing choice between a
nuclear-armed Iran or another war in the Middle East." The response from
Iran itself, however, was muted. **[President Hassan Rouhani declared
that the Iranians intended to abide by the terms of the deal, and he
criticized Mr. Trump for his history of not honoring international
treaties. Mr. Trump won strong backing from Saudi Arabia and Israel,
whose leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, hailed him for a
"historic move" and "courageous leadership."]{.underline}**

## A2: Impacts

### Aff Solves

#### The link does not assume the plan -- if Israel were to strike Iran, it would do so using US equipment. Aff solves the link.

**Bachar 17** \[Ariel, "JCPOA: Implications and Effects on Our Current
Military Sales Program." Public Contract Law Journal, Vol 46, Iss. 4,
Summer 2017 //tjb\]

In the past, Israeli officials considered strikes against the Iranian
nuclear program to neutralize a perceived threat to Israel\'s
existence.12 **[Although most Israeli analysts believe that JCPOA takes
a deliberate attack on Iran\'s nuclear facilities offthe table, future
military conflict remains a possibility.]{.underline}**13 **[An Israeli
attack on Iran could involve U.S. equipment or technology, given the
large amount Israel acquires through the FMS program.]{.underline}**14
**[The United States might then be faced with determining: (1) whether
the attack violates the conditions of the FMS program; and (2) if so,
whether to suspend or terminate Israel\'s participation in the
program.]{.underline}**15 A restriction on Israel\'s participation in
the FMS program may contradict current legislation committing the United
States to annually provide Israel with aid, thus helping Israel to
maintain a qualitative military edge in the Middle East.16 Additionally,
it might negatively impact the U.S. defense industry, costing defense
contractors one of their largest consumers and creating long-term profit
loss.17 **[Conversely, failing to take action against Israel for its
potential questionable conduct can lead to both public scrutiny and
litigation against the U.S. government and defense
contractors.]{.underline}**

### No Middle East War

#### Conflicts will occur in the Middle East, but they [will not escalate]{.underline} because of changed attitudes, collective security institutions, and [international cooperation]{.underline}

**Evans 14** -- Richard Evans, regius professor of history at the
University of Cambridge and president of Wolfson College, Cambridge,
Ph.D. from Oxford, previously taught at the University of Stirling,
University of East Anglia and Birkbeck College, 2014 ("What Can 1914
Tell Us About 2014?" *New Republic*, January 26^th^,
<http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116347/what-pre-world-war-i-europe-can-tell-us-about-today>)

[The Balkan states, much like nations of the Middle East today, to a
degree stood **proxy for larger powers**]{.underline}, notably tsarist
Russia, Germany and Austria-Hungary. They had come close to the brink
during the first Balkan war in 1912-13, when Montenegro in alliance with
Serbia attacked northern Albania, where there were virtually no Serbs or
Montenegrins among the inhabitants. Austria-Hungary demanded Serbia's
with­drawal, Russia began to mobilise in support of the Serbs, and France
declared its support for the Russians. The situation was defused only by
a British intervention, resulting in an international conference that
guaranteed independence for Albania. The whole episode was an ominous
foretaste of what happened in August 1914. With the break-up of the
alliance of the Balkan states in 1913, Bulgaria went over to the
patronage of the Germans, while Russia's only client left in the region
was Serbia. Serbian ambitions had already prompted Austria-Hungary to
annex Bosnia and Herzegovina, with their substantial population of
Serbs, in 1908. It would be just as wrong to dismiss all of this as
irrelevant to the ambitions and rivalries of the Great Powers, as Boris
Johnson has done recently, as it would be to dismiss the violent
antagonisms in today's Middle East as unimportant to international
relations on a wider scale. And yet the Balkan nations in the late 19th
and early 20th centuries were no more mere puppets of Germany or Russia
than the Middle Eastern states of today are puppets of America, Russia
or China. As President Obama has discovered, trying to control Israeli
governments is no easy task; he might tell the Israelis not to build any
new Jewish settlements on the occupied West Bank but they carry on
regardless. [China and Russia might block western attempts to impose
sanctions on the Assad regime in Syria and may continue supplying it
with arms]{.underline}, but they have not been able to control it or
stop its opponents, so they have become willing to explore ways of
ending the conflict peaceably; their co-operation in the removal of
chemical weapons signals their refusal to back the regime all the way.
[China supplies Iran with weapons and with nuclear technology but can do
little to mediate its policy in the Middle East, and its approach is
tempered by the need to keep up good **relations** with the United
States]{.underline}. Not least because of the growing importance of
economic ties with the west, Russia has bowed to international pressure
for sanctions on Iran and has curbed its arms supplies to the country.
[In all of this, there are **few indications**]{.underline} [that the
world's great powers today are being drawn into regional conflicts as
closely as they were in 1914]{.underline}. [One important reason for
this lies in our **changed attitudes to war**]{.underline}. [In Europe,
the wars of the 19th century were limited in duration and scope, and
seldom involved more than a handful of combatant nations]{.underline}.
All told, deaths in battle between 1815 and 1914 were seven times fewer
than combat deaths in the previous century. The wars of German
unification in the 1860s, the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-78 and similar
conflicts were swiftly resolved by decisive victories for one side or
the other. Even the Crimean war of 1854-56 did not move much beyond the
hinterland of the Black Sea. In the 19th century fear of the upheaval
and destruction caused by the French revolutionary and Napoleonic wars
brought the leading European states together time and again in what was
known as the Concert of Europe to resolve potential conflicts through
international conferences. Though it was severely damaged in the 1850s
and 1860s, the Concert was patched together again in the 1870s, when the
Congress of Berlin redrew the map of the Balkans, while another Berlin
conference sorted out colonial rivalries (without, needless to say,
consulting any of the millions of people about to be colonised) in 1884.
These [institutions, like the United Nations of today, provided a forum
in which diplomats and statesmen could work together to avoid war, and
they **largely succeeded**]{.underline}. [If there is no sign that the
UN]{.underline}, for all its inadequacies, [is about to
collapse]{.underline}, [it is not least because the postwar
settlement]{.underline} of 1945 [rested on a general recognition
that]{.underline} **[international co-operation]{.underline}** [in all
fields had to be stronger than it was under the League of
Nations]{.underline}, the UN's ill-fated predecessor. The destruction
caused by the Second World War, with its 50 million or more dead, its
ruined cities, its genocides, its widespread negation of civilised
values, had a far more powerful effect than the deaths caused by the
First World War, which were (with exceptions, notably the genocide of a
million or more Armenian civilians, killed by the Turks in 1915) largely
confined to troops on active service. In 1945, Hiroshima and Nagasaki
provided an additional, ter­rible warning of what would happen if the
world went to war again.

#### Institutions and [deterrence]{.underline} prevent escalation

Oxford, and Joseph Nye, Distinguished Service Professor at the Harvard

Today Is Different From The 1914 Outbreak Of World War I," *Business
Insider*, July 26^th^,

[With the world caught in a series of potential proxy wars
from]{.underline} Ukraine to **[the Middle East]{.underline}** and
tensions ratcheting in East Asia and elsewhere, [many have compared the
present to 1914]{.underline}, when a trigger event in Sarajevo activated
military alliances and led to a devastating global war. Especially on
the 100-year anniversary of the start of World War I, the similarities
come to mind easily, but **[is history really repeating?]{.underline}**
[Richard Evans]{.underline}, the Regius Professor of History at
Cambridge, [identified **key difference**]{.underline} [between now and
then in a January article in the New Statesman]{.underline}. [These
include balancing tendencies of the multipolar world we live in now as
well as the emergence of \"**institutions of collective
security**\"]{.underline} like the United Nations, which makes a big
difference even if they may seem ineffective. Above all, he believes
people have learned from history, as he said in an interview with the
New Republic: I think the major difference now is that we've had two
World Wars, and we've had the nuclear age. Whereas in 1914, states, and
for that matter most of the public in most nations, had what we now
think of as a very irresponsible attitude toward war. They went into it
in a gung-ho way. Now I think [we are much more afraid of a major war,
and we are **much more cautious** about it]{.underline}. I think the
attitude of politicians today is very different from what it was in
1914. As for WWI not preventing WWII, many see the latter as an
extension of the former, and anyway WWII had a greater effect. Writes
Evans: The destruction caused by the Second World War, with its 50
million or more dead, its ruined cities, its genocides, its widespread
negation of civilised values, had a far more powerful effect than the
deaths caused by the First World War, which were (with exceptions,
notably the genocide of a million or more Armenian civilians, killed by
the Turks in 1915) largely confined to troops on active service. In
1945, Hiroshima and Nagasaki provided an additional, ter­rible warning of
what would happen if the world went to war again. [Harvard Professor
Joseph S. Nye]{.underline}, Jr. similarly [commented]{.underline} on
changing attitudes toward war in a January article: [Today\'s world is
**different from the world of 1914**]{.underline} in several important
ways. One is that [nuclear weapons give political leaders the equivalent
of a crystal ball that shows what their world would look like after
escalation]{.underline}. Perhaps if the Emperor, the Kaiser, and the
Czar had had a crystal ball showing their empires destroyed and their
thrones lost in 1918, they would have been more prudent in 1914.
Certainly, the crystal-ball effect had a strong influence on US and
Soviet leaders during the Cuban missile crisis. It would likely have a
similar influence on US and Chinese leaders today. [Another difference
is that the ideology of war is much **weaker** nowadays]{.underline}. In
1914, war really was thought to be inevitable, a fatalistic view
reinforced by the Social Darwinist argument that war should be welcomed,
because it would \"clear the air\" like a good summer storm.

### No Strikes -- No Iran Aggression

#### Deterrence checks -- Iran won't escalate in aggression despite inflammatory rhetoric.

**Wright 10** (Parker, Intelligence Officer in the United States Air
Force and Masters in Public Policy from Harvard "Bombs and Umbrellas:
Defending US Middle East Allies from a Nuclear-Armed Iran") NIJ

[Some question, given the nature of the regime, whether or not Iran can
be deterred. They question the rationality of Supreme Leader Khomenei
and President Ahmadenejad.]{.underline} However, Robert Jervis assures
us that, "[Much less than total rationality is needed for the main lines
of \[deterrence\] theory to be valid."]{.underline}27 In fact,
["Rationality may be neither necessary nor sufficient for
deterrence."]{.underline}28 Patrick Morgan offers an alternative
formulation: ["Deterrence rests less on the capacities of men for
rationality than on their ability to be conscious of their limitations
and adjust their behavior accordingly.]{.underline}"29 [An adversary
must be capable of "sensible" decision making, not necessarily rational
decision making. But are Iran‟s leaders sensible? Many observers are
concerned about religious fanaticism.]{.underline} Ahmadenejad routinely
interweaves mysticism into his public pronouncements on Iran‟s nuclear
program. Of concern is Shia Islam‟s belief in the "Hidden Imam," also
referred to as al Mahdi. In contrast to Sunni Muslims, Shiites believe
the legitimate heirs to Mohammed are direct descendants from the
Prophet. Most Shiites believe there have been eleven rightful
successors, the Twelfth Imam having entered a period of occultation in
874 AD only to return on the Day of Judgment. The Mahdi will be called
forth to restore justice on Earth only after a period of apocalyptic
turmoil leaving five out of every seven people dead. This leads some to
suggest that a nuclear armed Iran would attempt to usher in the return
of the Mahdi by igniting a nuclear conflagration.30 While this line of
reasoning cannot be fully discredited, [there is nothing in Iranian
behavior since the 1979 Revolution to suggest Iran is driven by
fanatical religious zealots intent on destroying the world. Would Iran
be willing to risk Tehran to take out Tel Aviv?]{.underline} In fact,
Ken Waltz observes, ["Rulers want to have a country that they can
continue to rule."]{.underline}31 [Waltz suggests Iran may be
self-limiting by acquiring nuclear weapons, "In a nuclear world, no one
can escalate to a level of force anywhere near the top without risking
its own destruction."]{.underline}32 Similarly, ["For fear of
escalation, nuclear states do not want to fight long and hard over
important interests--- indeed, they do not want to fight at
all."]{.underline}33 James Lindsay and Ray Takeyh agree, **["Despite
their Islamist compulsions, the mullahs like power too much to be
martyrs."]{.underline}**34 **[They have systematically avoided direct
military confrontation with either the United States or Israel.
Regularly displaying pragmatism, the Iranian regime has worked to
balance the tensions between their revolutionary ideals and their
governing responsibilities. Iran has challenged the US presence in both
Iraq and Afghanistan but has done so in a way that avoids
escalation.]{.underline}** At times, Iran has even supported US policy
objectives in both countries when their national interests aligned. It
is difficult to look past the bellicose rhetoric, especially if you are
Israel, but [the Iranian government‟s actions have fallen well within
the "sensible" range. There is nothing then to suggest Tehran is immune
to traditional statecraft.]{.underline}

### No Strikes -- Isolation

#### No Israeli attack -- international isolation more threatening than Iran 

**Tarnopolsky 15** (Noga -- journalist for Reuters. She has two decades
of experience covering international politics. "Israel won\'t strike
Iran alone, no matter how much it hates the nuclear deal." Reuters. July
16^th^ 2015. <http://www.trust.org/item/20150716200538-sujfm>)

[Israeli officials]{.underline} across the political landscape [decried
the \"very bad deal]{.underline},\" as Netanyahu termed the agreement,
which the United States and five world powers hope will curb Iran\'s
weaponization of its nuclear program. [But no one]{.underline}, not even
the prime minister, [rattled the sabers of war.]{.underline} \"[An
Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear sites is no longer a relevant
scenario]{.underline},\" wrote Amos Harel, military analyst for the
Israeli daily Haaretz. Once the agreement was announced late Tuesday
night, Netanyahu\'s first, brief statement ignored the nuclear issue
entirely and asserted that \"the world is a much more dangerous place
today than it was yesterday.\" \"The leading international powers have
bet our collective future on a deal with the foremost sponsor of
international terrorism,\" the statement said. \"They\'ve gambled that
in 10 years\' time, Iran\'s terrorist regime will change while removing
any incentive for it to do so.\" It was not a frivolous sentiment for
the leader of a small state on permanent war alert with two of Iran\'s
ruthless proxies, Hezbollah and Hamas, on its northern and southern
borders. In an interview with the New York Times a few hours later,
President Barack Obama responded soberly (if testily) to the charge.
\"What\'s been striking to me is that increasingly the critics are
shifting off the nuclear issue, and they\'re moving into, \'Well,\'\"
the president said, slipping into his opponents\' characters, \"\'even
if the nuclear issue is dealt with, they\'re still going to be
sponsoring terrorism and they\'re still going to get the sanctions
relief and so they\'re going to have more money to engage in these bad
activities.\'\" \"That is a possibility,\" the president acknowledged.
\"And we are going to have to systematically guard against that and work
with our allies, the Gulf countries, Israel, to stop the work that they
are doing outside of the nuclear program.\" The difference in
perspective is essential. If Iran represents a challenge - and,
possibly, a future nuclear power - to the United States, for Israel,
Iran is an implacable foe that strikes on every level and on every
platform, from its flagship nuclear program to its support of Mideast
Islamist groups, from cyber warfare to its sponsorship of attacks
against Israeli targets worldwide. Israel views the sanctions that have
crippled Iran\'s economy as a force that curtails it on all fronts.
\"Israel is like the little child who is pointing its finger and saying,
\'The king is naked, this agreement is naked!\'\" said Yuval Steinitz,
Israel\'s minister responsible for nuclear affairs. The grim ping pong
between Washington and Jerusalem was so intense that, had relations
between the two allies not already been at a nadir, it would have been
tempting to speculate that the United States and Israel were playing a
coordinated game of good cop, bad cop. The American gambit, made
explicit by the president, is to separate the nuclear issue from all
other \"odious\" Iranian activities and hope for a nuclear-bomb halt for
10 years. In Israeli eyes, those are 10 years in which Iran will invest
in all sorts of odiousness, including, but not limited to, the nuclear.
Iran has two paths to the bomb, Netanyahu told NBC. \"One is if they
keep the deal, and the other is if they cheat on the deal. They can
cheat on the deal because inspections are not instantaneous. In fact,
you don\'t have inspections within 24 hours; you have 24 days before you
can inspect any site that you find suspicious in Iran.\" \"Twenty-four
days. Can you imagine giving a drug dealer 24 days\' notice before you
check the premises? That\'s a lot of time to flush a lot of meth down
the toilet.\" Frank-Walter Steinmeier, [Germany\'s foreign minister,
slammed Netanyahu\'s recalcitrance and defended the deal as
\"responsible]{.underline}.\" He said, \"Israel should also take a
closer look at it and not criticize the agreement in a very coarse
way.\" Worse, [British Foreign Secretary]{.underline} Philip
[Hammond]{.underline}, who will be in Jerusalem on Thursday, [betrayed
his lack of sympathy for Netanyahu\'s hard line: \"The question you have
to ask yourself is what kind of a deal would have been welcomed in Tel
Aviv. The answer,]{.underline} of course, [is that Israel doesn\'t want
any deal with Iran]{.underline}. Israel wants a permanent state of
stand-off, and I don\'t believe that\'s in the interests of the
region.\" The significance of the statement is not principally in its
uncommon public expression of exasperation but in the seemingly offhand
reference to Israel\'s commercial capital. It is almost unheard of for a
representative of an Israeli ally to use Tel Aviv as shorthand for the
state, which claims Jerusalem as its \"eternal, unified capital.\" [The
offense to Israeli sensibilities]{.underline} on the eve of a state
visit [is huge]{.underline}. Why such fury? Netanyahu is reaping the
harvest of the scorn he\'s heaped on the West and his brazen alliance
with Republicans, which culminated in last March\'s controversial
address to Congress in which he railed against this very Iran deal. That
[bad blood is exposing Israel to a risk that is no less significant than
that posed by Iran: **the danger of international
isolation**]{.underline}. Harel, the military analyst, estimates that
\"the serious crisis in U.S.-Israeli relations, at whose lies the tense
relationship between Obama and Netanyahu, has produced a situation in
which the prime minister\'s influence over the nuclear talks\' final
stages was marginal.\" [Israel\'s response to the threat posed by
Iran\'s new stature,]{.underline} he concludes, [\"depends on achieving
closer ties with the United States.\"]{.underline}

### No Strikes -- Iran Not a Threat

#### The Israeli military doesn't consider Iran a threat.

**Keck 15** -- (5/28, Zachary, Managing Editor at The National Interest,
"Israeli Military: Iran Is Not Most Dangerous Threat,"
http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/israels-military-iran-not-most-dangerous-threat-12989)

**[Israel's military doesn't consider Iran to be the greatest threat to
the Jewish state]{.underline}**, according to a new report. Earlier this
week, the Jewish weekly, [Forward, reported that the "Israel's military
General Staff and intelligence services are in the midst of a series of
formal discussions" about the major threats facing the country.
According to the report]{.underline}, [the discussions]{.underline}---
which are being "chaired by the deputy chief of staff of the Israel
Defense Forces, Major General Yair Golan, under the supervision of the
chief of staff, Lieutenant General Gadi Eizenkot"---[are not focusing on
a nuclear Iran]{.underline}. "[What most concerns the military in the
short range is the likelihood of renewed flare-ups]{.underline} within
the next few years with the heavily armed Islamist militias [on Israel's
northern and southern borders, Hezbollah and Hamas]{.underline}," the
report, which is by former Forward editor-in-chief J.J. Goldberg, says.
As a result, [Eizenkot, who]{.underline} only [recently took over the
reigns of the IDF, "is trying to direct every possible resource toward
reorganization, reinforcement and intensified training of the **army's
ground forces**,]{.underline}" who would be tasked with most of the
fighting in a war with Hezbollah or Hamas.

### No Strikes -- Bluffing

#### No strike -- it's just bluffing to extract concessions.

**Porter 15** -- (Gareth Porter, PhD, former professor of international
studies at City College of New York and American University, former
Academic Director for Peace and Conflict Resolution in the Washington
Semester program at American University, "How Close Was Israel to
Bombing Iran?" TruthOut.org, August 31, 2015,
http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/32573-how-close-was-israel-to-bombing-iran)

[New evidence has]{.underline} now [surfaced from]{.underline} former
Israeli Defense Minister [Ehud Barak that Israel came close to attacking
Iran three times over the past few years - if you believe what
\"[major](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/22/middleeast/israel-plan-iran-military-target-strike/)\"
[news
media](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/22/world/middleeast/israel-came-close-to-attacking-iran-ex-defense-minister-says.html)
reported about the story. **But you shouldn\'t believe it.** The latest
story is only a continuation of the clever ploy that has been carried
out by Israeli administrations from Ehud Olmert to Benjamin Netanyahu to
convince the world that it was seriously contemplating war against Iran
in order to pressure them toward crippling sanctions against Iran, if
not military confrontation with it.]{.underline} And [there is even very
strong circumstantial evidence that the Obama administration was
**consciously playing its part in a \"good cop/bad cop routine**\" with
the Israelis over the ostensible Israeli war threat until early 2012 to
influence other states\' Iran policies and gain political leverage on
Iran]{.underline}. The latest episode in the seemingly endless story of
Israel\'s threat of war followed the broadcast in Israel of interviews
by Barak for a new biography. The New York Times\'[Jodi Rudoren
reported](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/22/world/middleeast/israel-came-close-to-attacking-iran-ex-defense-minister-says.html)
that, in those interviews, Barak revealed new details to his biographers
about how close Israel came to striking Iran. [Barak said that he and
Netanyahu were ready to attack Iran each year, but claimed that
something always went wrong]{.underline}. Barak referred to three
distinct episodes from 2010 through 2012 in which the he and Netanyahu
were supposedly maneuvering to bring about an air attack on Iran\'s
nuclear program. **[But a closer look at Barak\'s claims shows that in
reality neither Barak nor Netanyahu was really ready to go to war
against Iran]{.underline}**. One of the episodes occurred in 2010 when
[Netanyahu ordered the Israeli army to put Israeli forces on the highest
possible state of alert reserved for preparation for actual war, only to
be frustrated by the refusal of Israeli army chief of staff Ashkenazi to
the order]{.underline}. But [an Israeli television program on the
episode aired in a television special in 2012
\"[suggested](http://www.ipsnews.net/2012/11/netanyahus-2010-order-was-not-a-move-to-war-on-iran/)\"
that the order was not intended as a prelude to war. Although the
television account was not allowed to give the date of the episode, it
is consistent with what happened on May 17, 2010, when Turkish Prime
Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Da
Silva reached an agreement with Iran on a \"fuel swap\" deal. Netanyahu
regarded [the
agreement](http://www.jpost.com/Iranian-Threat/News/Govt-rejects-Iran-deal-as-a-ruse)
as a maneuver to derail a new UN Security Council agreement on
sanctions, but the government issued no public statement that
day]{.underline}. **[Barak denied on the Israeli program that he and
Netanyahu had intended to go through with an actual attack, which
implied that it was to be a short-term bluff to ensure that the
sanctions agreement would go through]{.underline}**. Ashkenazi\'s
opposition to the order was not that it was intended to take Israel into
war, but that it could easily provoke a military response from Iran.
**[Both Barak and Ashkenazi agreed on the program, and moreover, that
the Israeli army lacked the capability to carry out a successful strike
against Iran without US involvement]{.underline}**. **[That agreement
reflected a broad consensus within the Israeli security elite that
Israel could not carry out a successful operation against Iran without
the full involvement of the United States]{.underline}**. Nevertheless,
[that elite believed that **the threat was necessary to pressure the
rest of the world to act on Iran**]{.underline}. As Yossi
[Alpher]{.underline}, a [former aide to Barak, told me]{.underline} in
2012, [most retired national security officials were totally opposed to
an attack on Iran, but they remained silent because they did want to
\"spoil Bibi\'s successful bluster.\"]{.underline} A second episode to
which Barak refers to in his interviews involves his demanding that the
United States postpone the joint military exercise planned for spring
2012, which he now says he did in order to be able to order an attack on
Iran during that period without implicating the United States in the
decision. [But the postponement was announced in mid-January 2012, in
plenty of time for Barak to plan the strike against Iran - if that is
indeed what he and Netanyahu had intended. Instead, it didn\'t happen,
and Barak offers no real explanation, commenting that they were \"still
unable to find the right moment.\" The Obama administration **pretended
to be alarmed** about Netanyahu\'s readiness to attack]{.underline}. But
[Obama was actually **playing along with the Israeli strategy** in order
to line up support for a more aggressive regime of sanctions and then to
put pressure on Iran to enter into negotiations aimed at closing down
its enrichment program]{.underline}. Gary [Samore, Obama\'s adviser on
WMD, had]{.underline} openly [espoused]{.underline} the notion before
taking that job [that the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[should exploit an Israeli threat to attack Iran to **put pressure on
the Iranians over their nuclear program**]{.underline}. At a Harvard
University symposium in September 2008, [Samore
opined](http://www.cfr.org/iran/iran-policy-options-next-administration/p34420)
that [the next administration would not want to \"act in a way that
precludes the \[Israeli\] threat, because **we\'re using the threat as a
political instrument**.\"]{.underline} The [Obama]{.underline}
administration\'[s policy toward Iran clearly applied that Samore
strategy]{.underline} early and often. Within weeks of his arrival in
the White House, on April 1, 2009, Obama\'s Defense Secretary Robert
[Gates and]{.underline} the Commander of CENTCOM David [Petraeus both
[commented publicly](http://ipsnorthamerica.net/news.php?idnews=2140)
that Israel was bound to attack Iran within a matter of a few years at
most, **unless Iran came to heel on its nuclear program.**]{.underline}
And in mid-November 2009[, [Obama
sent](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/25/AR2009112504112.html)
Dennis Ross and Jeffrey Bader of the White House staff to Beijing to
warn the Chinese that the United States could not restrain Israel from
an attack on Iran much longer unless the Security Council adopted a
strong package of tough economic sanctions against Iran]{.underline}.
[That diplomatic exploitation of the Israeli threat came seven months
after Haaretz
[reported](http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/israel-u-s-will-know-before-any-iran-strike-1.276075)]{.underline}
in May 2009 [that]{.underline} CIA Director Leon [Panetta
had]{.underline} just **[obtained a commitment from Netanyahu and Barak
that they would not take military action without consulting Washington
first]{.underline}**. That commitment reflected a reality that most
senior national security officials accepted - that Israel could attack
Iran without US cooperation. **[What happened in late 2011 and early
2012 was a \"good cop/bad cop\" routine by Panetta and Barak at a
historical juncture when the United States and Israel were cooperating
closely in a strategy to get crippling sanctions against Iran approved
in the UN Security Council while pressuring Iran to begin negotiating on
its enrichment program]{.underline}**. Panetta\'s role in the routine
was to wring his hands over alleged indications that Israel was intent
on a strike in the spring. But [Panetta\'s [interview with David
Ignatius](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/is-israel-preparing-to-attack-iran/2012/02/02/gIQANjfTkQ_story.html)
in early February 2012 in which he warned of the \"strong likelihood\"
of an Israeli attack in \"April, May or June\" included **a clear
give-away that the real purpose of his warning was to gain diplomatic
leverage on Iran**.]{.underline} [He suggested to the Iranians that
there were two ways to **\"dissuade the Israelis from such an
attack\"**: either Iran could begin serious negotiations on its nuclear
program or the United States could step up its own cyber-attacks against
Iran. Later]{.underline} that year, of course, [Obama would break
dramatically with Netanyahu\'s strategy]{.underline}. But [despite that
clear indication in early 2012 that Panetta was playing a game that
suited the interests of both administrations, **consumers of the
world\'s commercial news media were led to believe that Barak and
Netanyahu were on the brink of war. Barak himself is still peddling that
same warmed-over, patently false tale of near war-war with Iran. And in
one more indicator of the degree to which the media parrot the Israeli
line on Iran, they are still reporting it as unquestioned fact
today**]{.underline}.

### No Strikes -- Military Blocks

#### No attack -- military blocks it.

**Cole 15** -- (8/24, Juan, PhD in Islamic Studies, Richard P. Mitchell
Collegiate Professor of History at the University of Michigan, "Is
Israeli military using Barak in struggle w/ Netanyahu over Iran Deal?"
http://www.juancole.com/2015/08/military-struggle-netanyahu.html)

[In 2010]{.underline}, Israeli chief of staff Gaby [Ashkenazi
stopped]{.underline} [them]{.underline} [by maintaining that the
military did not have the capacity for this mission]{.underline}. ([Iran
is very distant]{.underline} and [Israel's planes can't get there and
back]{.underline} very easily, [nor would they be allowed to fly over
Turkey or Iraq]{.underline}, [nor would the Iranians take it lying
down]{.underline}). [In 2011, even other far right wing hard
liners]{.underline} on the cabinet [voted against.]{.underline} And in
2012, the US launched joint military maneuvers with Israel around the
time of the planned attack, which would have made it look as though the
US were behind the strike and even **[Netanyahu and Barak couldn't risk
Washington's wrath]{.underline}**. Note that [strikes on thousands of
active centrifuges and stockpiled enriched uranium would have released
enormous amounts of radioactive material into the air]{.underline} of
Isfahan (pop. nearly 2 million, i.e. nearly the size of Houston, Texas),
[constituting a de facto dirty-bomb attack on Iran]{.underline} with
large loss of life. Some of the **[radioactive fallout would have come
back on Israel itself]{.underline}**. Apparently Barak thought that the
interviews would remain background for his book and not be leaked
because military censors in Israel would never approve them for
publication or broadcast. But the military censor has twice given Israel
2 radio the go-ahead to broadcast excerpts from the tapes. While
speculation rages in Israel that Barak is trying to undermine his
enemies as part of a bid to come back as the head of the Labor Party and
make another bid to be prime minister (Ashkenazi is a rival here), and
that trash-talking Netanyahu is part of this plan, it seems more likely
that he did not expect the interviews to be allowed on the air. If this
interpretation is true, then it is likely that elements in the Israeli
military high command ordered the censor to allow the tapes to come out
in public, and that it is they who want Netanyahu weakened. We know that
[Israeli army chief of staff]{.underline} Gen. Gadi [Eizenkot and many
other high officers **do not think Iran is the primary security threat**
to Israel]{.underline}. [It is likely that they have been extremely
annoyed by Netanyahu's challenge to]{.underline} the [Obama]{.underline}
administration [in trying to derail the Iran deal]{.underline} on
monitoring its nuclear facilities. [The tapes]{.underline} would serve
the Israeli military well in any struggle with Netanyahu. First, they
[underline that a previous chief of staff]{.underline}, Gaby
[Ashkenazi]{.underline}, [had the ability to block the prime minister
from a reckless strike on Iran in 2010]{.underline}. Second, Barak's
comments make Netanyahu look like an unstable combination of Hamlet and
Napoleon-- pessimistic, depressed, timid, and yet capable of erratically
deciding to lash out at a country 10 times the size of Israel that has
millions of armed allies in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.

### Marxism Inadequate

#### Western Marxism is simply inadequate to address the nuances of colonialism -- the "logic" of capital is best understood through settler and exploitative colonialism.

**MOOKERJEA 18** -- Director, Intermedia Research Studio Department of
Sociology, University of Alberta, PhD, Graduate Programme in Social &
Political Thought at York University \[Sourayan, "Accumulated Violence,
or, the Wars of Exploitation: Notes Toward a Post-Western Marxism,"
Mediations 32.1 (Fall 2018) 95-114, DKP\]

[This essay sketches an outline of]{.underline} what I will call here
["post-Western Marxism."]{.underline}2 Though very few people really use
this term, I believe that [many of us]{.underline} around the world [are
working on such a project]{.underline} in a range of different ways
[because getting beyond the **parochialism and sexism** of much Western
Marxist theorizing is **crucial and urgent. Marxism**]{.underline}, as
Cedric Robinson observes, [**remains "distracted** from the cruelest and
most characteristic manifestations of the world economy.]{.underline}
[This exposed the **inadequacies of Marxism**]{.underline} as an
apprehension of the modern world, but [equally troubling was Marxism's
neglect and miscomprehension of the nature and genesis of liberation
struggles]{.underline} which already had occurred and surely had yet to
appear among these people."3 Consequently, Robinson offers us Black
Marxism; but I want to honor and not appropriate that crucial radical
tradition in this brief sketch. Like many, I also take it as
self-evident that [any theoretical Marxism reconstructed to be
adequate]{.underline} for our times **[must also be a feminist
theory.]{.underline}** By post-Western Marxism, then, I don't mean a
Marxism only by, or about, or for the people of the global South or any
other geopolitical-cultural region, nor a Marxism displaced by
postcolonial theory. Rather, [I mean a truly global Marxism that builds
on]{.underline} the [insights]{.underline} of Western Marxism, Black
Marxism, Asian, African, and Latin American Marxisms, [but does not
habitually universalize in a gender-blind way]{.underline} some
fragments of the [historical experiences]{.underline} of the United
States and Western Europe. [It is therefore not limited by Western
Marxism's inability to think through the social, political, cultural,
and ecological realities of most of the world]{.underline}; I mean then
a Marxist theory that is not "passing for white" in the global order of
knowledge power and a Marxist theory that is also a feminist theory in
this specific way. In these notes, I make [three related
arguments]{.underline}. First, [I will argue that]{.underline} both for
Marx and for us today, [**exploitation is** best understood **not only**
as the **private appropriation** of surplus value **but also** as
**subalternization.**]{.underline} Second, I will argue that [**Marx's
critique of** the so-called "logic" of **capital is best** **understood
through**]{.underline} our critical [understanding of the histories of
**colonization**]{.underline}; that is to say, through our understanding
of what Robinson calls "racial capitalism" and world-systems analysts
call "historical capitalism" since the modern histories of colonization
and historical or racial capitalism are essentially two sides of the
same coin. Third, I will argue that **[since class politics is not
available to us in its immediacy, all politics is identity
politics]{.underline}**, [and that what is now commonly called the
intersectionality of class politics and identity politics]{.underline}
or feminist or cultural [politics is better understood as their
intermediation]{.underline} by the something I have elsewhere called
"accumulated violence" --- the "agency" of the histories of
exploitation-subalternization in the present.4

### Identity Politics Good

#### The affirmative doesn't ignore capitalism, but it understands that Marxist analysis must center identity politics as the condition of possibility for class politics.

For [Fanon's enduring lesson]{.underline} --- both anticipated and
repeated ever since by the poetry, literature, and art of the oppressed
--- [is that identities are not all historically constructed to be
ontologically equivalent]{.underline} like signifiers qua signifier; the
discursivists miss the obvious point that [black identity, or indigenous
identity, or immigrant identity, or feminist identity, as political
identities, are not on the same plane as masculinity or with passing for
white, or heterosexuality or ethnicity or national
identity.]{.underline} On this issue, neither signifiers nor eurocentric
models of power or desire are pertinent. But [the specificities of
colonizing capitalism]{.underline}, in all their diversity, [are
crucial. The racialized and colonized]{.underline}, as Fanon famously
argues, [are historically legislated and sentenced to a "zone of
non-being" through appropriation, colonization, and racialization of the
body]{.underline} "given back to me sprawled out, distorted,
recolored."34 [In affirming this being of non-being, Fanon's "aporetic
dialectic," as]{.underline} Sekyi-Otu calls it, indeed **["stretches"
Marxist analyses by throwing new light on Marx's own
dialectic]{.underline}**, which seeks to render critically intelligible
the fetish character of the commodity form of value. For Marx, this is
ultimately a story of class violence wherein proprietors run their
networks of colonizing institutions in such a way that value as the
representation of capitalist wealth does not represent the common wealth
on which it depends and which Herculean capitalist class power both
encloses and appropriates. Marx draws on the colonial discourse of the
fetish, in formation ever since the Portuguese traded down the Gold
Coast of Africa in the fifteenth century, for a figure for representing
the violence with which the operations of markets in labor power and
capital restructure, subordinate, and in this way, colonize the ritual
"markets" of reciprocal exchange that constitutes the molecular media of
material life.35 [In colonizing various lifeworlds of
political-ecological reproduction]{.underline}, Herculean [class power,
working through the institutions of "modern society" and normalizing
homogeneous empty clock time]{.underline}, thereby transforms the
content, context, and consequences of everyday reciprocal exchange,
including their mediation of extant modes of domination, and so
[subalternizes these modern counter-environments of common being and
"Hydraheaded revolt" into racialized, criminalized, misogynistically
feminized non-being of "relationships between things" that thus form an
abstract colonial value matrix of assets and instruments of capitalist
accumulation.]{.underline}36 However, like Marx, Fanon's dialectic also
finds here the seeds of "sober senses" through which a
counter-environmental universality that is radically different from that
of the proprietors emerges as a real abstraction. [So with
Fanon]{.underline}, but also Adorno, [I want to insist on]{.underline}
the "utterly naked declivity," [the ultimate "primacy of the object," on
the historical, intersubjective, mediatory objectivity of accumulated
violence through which]{.underline} the singular [histories of
subalternization interlock and with which the different oppressions are
then stamped. The Eurocentric]{.underline}, Herculean [sciences and
humanities remain caught in]{.underline} their various [racializing,
exoticizing, Orientalizing idioms of repression and
erasure.]{.underline} Nonetheless, the singular histories of
subalternization are now manifestations of our common being and we can
study and learn from them. But we can also now understand how and why
**[identity politics is then the condition of possibility of class
politics]{.underline}** from below and cannot be simply explained away
as the legacy of post-war social movements from the Combahee River
Collective onwards plus consumerism. [Rather the discourses and
practices of identity]{.underline} of the past half-century, in whatever
ways they are unprecedented, [are themselves popular cultural sites of
hegemonic struggle and this conjunctural experience adds weight
to]{.underline} Etienne [Balibar's argument that there are no classes in
themselves, only classes for themselves, no classes without **active and
organized class struggle.**]{.underline}37 [Insofar as class
politics]{.underline} from [below is by definition]{.underline} then a
[matter of mass politics, a class politics on the Left begins not merely
with vague demands for jobs, better working conditions, rights in
production that the parliamentary Left restricts itself to]{.underline}
(for the Right can fight for these too), [but with an organized mass
struggle for the regeneration of common being and the abolition of
accumulated violence as the necessary condition of a just ecology of
planetary reproduction.]{.underline}

### Perm

#### Perm do both -- disentangling settler colonialism with colonialism as exploitation is ahistorical 

**MOOKERJEA 18** -- Director, Intermedia Research Studio Department of
Sociology, University of Alberta, PhD, Graduate Programme in Social &
Political Thought at York University \[Sourayan, "Accumulated Violence,
or, the Wars of Exploitation: Notes Toward a Post-Western Marxism,"
Mediations 32.1 (Fall 2018) 95-114, DKP\]

Accumulated Violence

We find a promising starting point for post-Western Marxist theory in
the growing interest in recent years in Marx's sarcastic critique of
classical political economy's fable of primitive accumulation.10 [Rather
than capital springing forth from the prudence]{.underline} and thrift
of proprietors, [Marx points instead to the **violence of enclosures,
colonial plunder, and the trans-Atlantic slave trade** as specific
violent forms of class power exercised in order to create a new
trans-Atlantic, and]{.underline} eventually, [global space making the
accumulation of capital possible.]{.underline}11 [These class projects
are comprised of innumerable]{.underline} more specific [forms of power
and violence ranging from war, conquest, and genocide to impressment,
criminalization, encroachment, expulsion, confiscation, monetization,
taxation, commodification, debt bondage, environmental destruction,
disentitlement, religious conversion and so on. Each of these
strategies]{.underline} and tactics [of class power sets in
place]{.underline}, Marx argues, [the conditions of possibility of world
scale capital accumulation.]{.underline} Insofar as these strategies and
tactics are recurrent, David Harvey renames all this as "accumulation by
dispossession" and argues that [accumulation by dispossession
intensifies as accumulation crises intensify.]{.underline} This reading
of Marx's critical genealogy anchors Harvey's theory of
"spatial-temporal fixes" in class politics and struggle. ["Solutions" to
accumulation crises are only "found" through class struggle
but]{.underline} as Harvey demonstrates [they involve the production of
new]{.underline} spaces and [temporalities of accumulation]{.underline}.
Though Harvey's own work often underplays it, his mentor Henri
Lefebvre's foundational contribution to Western Marxism makes it clear
that the **[capitalist production]{.underline}** of space [is never
ex-nihilo but rather **unfolds "backwards**]{.underline}," as in Walter
Benjamin's image of the "angel of history," [**from the destruction and
subalternization of other modes of socio-ecological
reproduction**:]{.underline} "the Spanish-American '[Orders for
Discovery and Settlement'"]{.underline} --- which laid the foundations
of the now globalized urban grid plan, Lefebvre reminds us --- ["were
arranged under the three heads of discovery, settlement and
pacification."]{.underline} "A social space of this kind" he observes
"is generated out of a rationalized and theorized form serving as an
instrument for the violation of an existing space."12 **[Therein lies
the inner connection]{.underline}**, I argue, [**between colonialism and
capitalism**: "Geometrical urban space in Latin America,"]{.underline}
Lefebvre continues[, "was intimately bound up with the extraction of
wealth in Western Europe]{.underline}; it is almost as though the riches
produced were riddled out through the gaps in the grid[, the
pre-existing space was destroyed from top to bottom."]{.underline}13 In
its investigations of the spaces and times of exploitation and in its
theorization of their articulations, post-Western Marxism does not
ignore this other "materialist telos" in human history: [the
reproduction of capitalist wealth and capitalist social relations of
production is necessarily a "Herculean" class project of
world-making]{.underline}, as Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker
describe it in their magisterial history [of the making of
trans-Atlantic capitalism.]{.underline}14 As such, [the capitalist mode
of socio-ecological reproduction]{.underline}, indeed its productivity
gains through ever greater scales of social cooperation, [understood as
historical process]{.underline} (and not as a logic but rather as the
witnessed ecological fate of the collective speciesbeing of the human
body) [is nothing other than the repeated destruction of other modes of
socio-ecological reproduction]{.underline}, past and future, through the
scalar expansion of its world-environments. But this also means that
**[the distinction between settler colonialism and the colonialisms of
exploitation is a schematic distinction]{.underline}** at best [which
obscures rather than clarifies the geography and geometry of **colonial
power since land-grabbing has long been connected to environment-making
for commodity production.**]{.underline}15 Indeed, modern colonialism
cannot be understood historically nor resisted today without reference
to the circuit of value of capital accumulation with its specifically
violent spatial production. Otherwise the history of humanity is the
history of settler colonialism which begins, not with the English
re-conquest of Ireland, but when we descended from the trees and
colonized the savannah. I therefore want to contextualize Harvey's
arguments by considering here a few other critical engagements with this
enigmatic chapter from Capital. I hope to demonstrate here that
[**together they provide a far more compelling account** of exploitation
and its links to domination and dispossession,]{.underline}
[theoretically and historically, than the standard arithmetic of
exploitation based on the calculation of surplus labor time]{.underline}
beyond average socially necessary labor time that usually stands at the
center of our understanding of Marx's critique. Let me be clear, though:
I am not suggesting that this received view is wrong or obsolete. Marx's
comparison of the political and reproductive affordance of the wage to
the productive and political power of cooperation proprietors of capital
appropriate is pertinent as ever. The wage, however, is a social,
ecological and historical institution, and not just a sum of money.
[Even when the fetishism of the value form is understood as social
domination, capitalism's]{.underline} historical and contemporary
[colonizing imperative is given short shrift and the
possibility]{.underline} that [the subalternized
counter-environments]{.underline} of this witnessed historical world
environment-making process [might hold critical lessons for the present
is overlooked.]{.underline}16 A [qualitative account of
exploitation]{.underline}, if I may put it that way, [as accumulated
violence]{.underline} and class war [would,]{.underline} I argue here,
[take us further in the direction of the]{.underline} more properly
post-Western [Marxism]{.underline} that [we urgently need
today.]{.underline}

## A2: Reformism Bad

#### The alt cedes the political -- their nihilism enables the Alt Right to dominate political discussions and spread hatred -- forsaking compromise is a dangerous, elitist luxury

**Claudio 16** \[assistant professor of development studies and
southeast Asian studies at the Ateneo de Manila University,
Intellectuals have ushered the world into a dangerous age of political
nihilism,
qz.com/721914/intellectuals-have-ushered-the-world-into-a-dangerous-age-of-political-nihilism/\]

[On the surface, it would seem]{.underline} that [intellectuals have
nothing to do with the rise of global illiberalism]{.underline}. The
[movements powering Brexit,]{.underline} Donald [Trump and]{.underline}
Third-World [strongmen like Philippine president]{.underline} Rodrigo
[Duterte all gleefully reject books, history and]{.underline} higher
[education in favor of railing against common enemies like outsiders and
globalization.]{.underline} And [you'll find few Trump supporters among
the largely left-wing American professoriate. Yet **intellectuals are
accountable** for the rise of these movements]{.underline}---albeit
[indirectly.]{.underline} [Professors]{.underline} have [offered
stringent criticisms]{.underline} of neoliberal society.
[But]{.underline} they have [failed to offer the public viable
**alt**]{.underline}ernative**[s]{.underline}**. In this way,
[they]{.underline} have [promoted]{.underline} a **[political
nihilism]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} has [set the stage for new
movements that reject liberal]{.underline} democratic [principles of
tolerance and institutional reform.]{.underline} Intellectuals have a
long history of critiquing liberalism, which relies on a "philosophy of
individual rights and (relatively) free markets." Beginning in the 19th
century, according to historian Francois Furet, left-wing thinkers began
to arrive at a consensus "that modern liberal democracy was threatening
society with dissolution because it atomized individuals, made them
indifferent to public interest, weakened authority, and encouraged class
hatred." For most of the 20th century, anti-liberal intellectuals were
able to come up with alternatives. Jean-Paul Sartre famously defended
the Soviet Union even when it became clear that Joseph Stalin was a mass
murderer. French, American, Indian, and Filipino university radicals
were hopelessly enamored of Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution in the
1970s. The collapse of Communism changed all this. [Some]{.underline}
[leftist intellectuals began to find hope in small revolutionary
guerrillas]{.underline} in the Third World, like Mexico's Subcomandante
Marcos. [Others fell back on pure critique. Academics are now mostly
gadflies who rarely offer strategies for political change. Those who do
forward alternatives propose ones so vague or divorced from reality that
they might as well be proposing nothing]{.underline}. (The Duke
University professor of romance studies Michael Hardt, for example,
thinks the evils of modern globalization are so pernicious that only
worldwide love is the answer.) [Such thinking promotes political
hopelessness. It rejects gradual change as cosmetic, while patronizing
those who think otherwise. This nihilism **easily spreads from the
classroom** and]{.underline} academic [journals to op-ed pages to
Zuccotti Park, and]{.underline} eventually to [the public at
large.]{.underline} For academic nihilists, the shorthand for the
world's evils is "neoliberalism." The term is used to refer to a free
market ideology that forced globalization on people by reducing the
power of governments. The more the term is used, however, the more it
becomes a vague designation for all global drudgery. Democratic politics
in the age of neoliberalism, according to Harvard anthropologists Jean
and John Comaroff, is "something of a pyramid scheme: the more it is
indulged, the more it is required." [They argue]{.underline} that [our
belief]{.underline} that [we can use laws]{.underline} and
constitutional processes [to defend our rights is a form of "fetishism"
that is ultimately "chimerical." For]{.underline} the University of
Chicago literary theorist Lauren [Berlant]{.underline}, the democratic
pursuit of happiness amid neoliberalism is [nothing but "cruel
optimism." The materialist things that people desire are "actually an
obstacle to your flourishing,]{.underline}" she writes. [According to
this logic, we are trapped by our own ideologies. It is this logic that
allows left-wing thinkers to implicitly side with British nativists
in]{.underline} their [condemnation of the EU. The radical website
Counterpunch]{.underline}, for example, [describes the EU as a
"neoliberal prison." It]{.underline} also [views liberals seeking to
reform the EU as "coopted by the right]{.underline} wing and its
goals---from the subversion of progressive economic ideals to
neoliberalism, to the enthusiastic embrace of neoconservative doctrine."
Across the Atlantic, [Trump supporters are singing a similar tune.
Speaking to a black, gay, college-educated Trump supporter]{.underline},
Samantha [Bee was told: "We've had]{.underline} these [disasters in
neoconservatism and neoliberalism and]{.underline} I think that he
\[[Trump]{.underline}\] [is an alternative]{.underline} to both those
paths." The [academic nihilists and]{.underline} the [Trumpists are in
agreement about a key issue: The system is fundamentally
broken]{.underline}, and [liberals who believe in working patiently
toward change are weak.]{.underline} For the Portuguese sociologist
Boaventura de Sousa Santos, "indifference" is the "the hallmark of
political liberalism." Since liberals balance different interests and
rights, Santos writes, they have no permanent friends or foes. He
proposes that the world needs to "revive the friend/foe dichotomy." And
in a profane way, it has: modern political movements pit Americans
against Muslims, Britain against Europe, a dictatorial government
against criminals. Unfortunately, [academic anti-liberalism is not
confined to the West]{.underline}. The Cornell political scientist
Benedict Anderson once described liberal democracy in the Philippines as
a "Cacique Democracy," dominated by feudal landlords and capitalist
families. In this system, meaningful reform is difficult, since the
country's political system is like a "well-run casino," where tables are
rigged in favor of oligarch bosses. [Having a nihilist streak myself,
I]{.underline} once [echoed Anderson]{.underline} [when I chastised
Filipino nationalists for projecting "hope onto spaces within an elite
democracy." Like Anderson, I offered no alt]{.underline}ernative. [The
alt]{.underline}ernative [arrived]{.underline} recently [in]{.underline}
the guise of the [Duterte, the new president of the Philippines. Like
Anderson and me, Duterte complained about the impossibility of real
change in a democracy dominated by elites and oligarchs]{.underline}.
But [unlike us, he proposed a way out: a strong political leader who was
willing to kill to save the country]{.underline} from criminals and
corrupt politicians. The [spread of global illiberalism is unlikely to
end soon. As this crisis unfolds, we]{.underline} will [need
intellectuals who use their intellects for more than simple
negation]{.underline}---professors like the late New York University
historian Tony Judt, who argued that European-style social democracy
could save global democracy. [Failing that, we need academics who
acknowledge]{.underline} that [liberal democracy, though slow and
imperfect, enables a bare minimum of tolerance in a world beset by
xenophobia and hatred. For although **academics have the luxury of
imagining a completely different world, the rest of us have to figure
out what to do with the one we have**.]{.underline}

## A2: State Bad

#### The state can be utilized for anti-colonial resistance -- to think otherwise forgoes a valuable tool in decolonization.

**Paperson 17** (Avatar of K. Wayne Yang, an associate professor of
ethnic studies at the University of California, San Diego (La Paperson,
A Third University is Possible,, June 2017, "You, a Scyborg", ebook))

It is in Ferguson's frame of queer desiring machines [that I consider
the scyborg]{.underline} (by associating with and deviating a bit from
Donna Haraway's formulation of the cyborg[) as the agentive body within
the **institutional machinery**]{.underline}. If we think of the
university as a machine that is the composite of many other machines,
these [machines are never perfect loyalists to
colonialism]{.underline}---in fact, they are quite disloyal. [They break
down and produce and travel in unexpected lines of
flight---]{.underline}flights that are at once enabled by the university
yet irreverent of that mothership of a machine. This same disloyalty
applies to the machined people, you. And thus there's some hope, the
hope of the scyborg. Organisms in the machinery are scyborgian: as
students, staff, faculty, alumni, and college escapees, technologies of
the university have been grafted onto you. Your witch's flight pulls
bits of the assemblage with you and sprays technology throughout its
path. The agency of [the scyborg]{.underline} is precisely that it is a
reorganizer of institutional machinery; it [subverts machinery against
the master code of its makers; it **rewires machinery to its own
intentions.**]{.underline} It's that elliptical gear that makes the
machine work (for freedom sometimes) by helping the machine (of
unfreedom) break down. The lopsided bot, the scyborg, the queer gear
with a g-limp---if there is anything to fear and to hope for in the
university, it could be you, and it could be me. Scyborgs have made a
third university. The scyborg is essential in producing the third world
university. The scyborg is machined person, [technologically enhanced by
legitimated knowledge and stamped with the]{.underline} university's
[brand]{.underline}. S-he is the perfect masculine expression of
education: an autonomous individual who will reproduce the logics of the
university without being told. The scyborg is the university's colonial
hope. Albert Memmi describes being a Tunisian Jew at the Sorbonne in the
1950s, wondering whether he would be allowed to take his exams. "It is
not a right," said the president of the exams jury. "It is a hope. . . .
Let us say that it is a colonial hope."\[2\] Scyborgs are creatures of
colonial desire: please be successful, be pretty, be human. The
scyborg's privilege is a manifestation of the first world university's
noblesse oblige. Thus a successful scyborg proves that the university is
ethical. However, on the flip side, the scyborg is a source of colonial
anxiety: please do not fail us, reject us, betray us. The scyborg has
hir desires too. Hirs is a decolonial hope. S-he is never a completely
loyal colonialist and can often be caught in the basement library,
building the third world university. To recognize the scyborg, I return
to the three examples of colonial schools in Kenya, North America, and
the Philippines. I do so to ask that we recognize the nineteenth- and
twentieth-century scyborgs that Christian missions, the U.S. Army, and
other colonial machines might have created by accident. I opened this
book with Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o's memoirs of Alliance High School and
wartime Kenya. The importance of starting with a Black example, and an
African example, is to choose a starting point that does not
disaggregate Indigeneity and Blackness in the conversations about
colonialism, even though the modes of operation of colonialism upon the
Black and the Indigenous are very divergent. At Alliance High School, wa
Thiong'o was inspired by Oliver Twist, in part out of identification
with the story boy's hunger; in part, perhaps, he aspired to be Charles
Dickens. If so, I believe he accomplished it. However, what the Dickens
he became is not something that missionary schools could have
recognized. He published his first novel in English while at the
University of Leeds in 1964. Returning to Kenya, he organized the highly
successful but politically explicit theater production of his 1977 play
Ngaahika Ndeenda (I will marry when I want), which was shut down by the
Kenyatta regime. Wa Thiong'o was imprisoned for a year in the Kamiti
Maximum Security Prison. There he wrote the first modern novel in the
Gĩkũyũ language, Caitaani mũtharaba-Inĩ (Devil on the cross), on
prison-issued toilet paper. [Luther Standing Bear was one of the first
students at Carlisle Industrial School]{.underline} for Indians when it
opened in 1879 and, indeed, a model student who looked up to the
founder, Captain "kill-the-Indian-save-the-man" Pratt. He even became a
recruiter for the school. However, [he went on to oppose the Dawes
Act]{.underline} that privatized Indian land held in common; [to argue
for]{.underline} bilingual education for Native children; and to
challenge the paradigms of property, Eurocentric history, and
assimilation---arguments and [alliances that successfully brought about
the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, which]{.underline} officially
reversed the Dawes Act and assimilationist schooling and [provided
pathways for tribes to reestablish sovereignty and tribal
government]{.underline}. Troy Richardson, drawing from Gerald Vizenor,
writes that Standing Bear's thoughts and deeds suggest a "shadow
curriculum" of a deep sovereignty beyond their immediate referents in
the (English) world. "Shadows are possibilities, neither empty nor
over-determined by words or referents but instances of
possibilities."\[3\] For such aviators of Indigenous futurity,
"consciousness is a rush of shadows in the distance."\[4\] As a third
example, the U.S. Army began educating Filipino schoolchildren in 1900
as a strategy of conquest in the Philippine--American War. Officers
served as school superintendents, enlisted men as teachers, enrolling
fifty thousand students in 1904 and more than one million in 1935.
Colonial schools were considered part of military operations, serving a
strategic purpose in quelling resistance. In The Miseducation of the
Filipino, Renato Constantino asserts, "Education, therefore, serves as a
weapon in wars of colonial conquest."\[5\] But like the graduates of the
boarding schools of Kenya, many of the graduates of these colonial
schools defied the schools' intended purpose of making colonial middle
management by coming to the United States---exploiting the unintended
loophole that colonized Filipinos were U.S. nationals. As Veta Schlimgen
explains, the desires and ambitions cultivated in the "culture of
education" created a new---and unanticipated---(im)migration dynamic
when, during the 1920s, Filipino students retraced the steps of American
colonizers. They migrated to the mainland states, and they sought
college degrees. Filipino student migration during the 1920s increased
remarkably. In 1919, about 450 Filipino students studied in the states.
Five years later, nearly 2000 did and, in 1930, the number of enrolled
students hovered around 3000. These numbers might seem small to us now
but in the context of student migration during the interwar years, they
are significant. During the 1920s, Filipino students constituted about
twenty percent of non-native born students.\[6\] Furthermore, "during
the first half of the 1920s, students (rather than laborers) made up the
majority of Filipino migrants to the mainland U.S." This unexpected
product of the colonial desiring machine ultimately helped to mobilize
history on the side of brown labor unionists in West Coast farms and
canneries. Notable organizers within the Cannery Workers' and Farm
Laborers' Union were first accomplished students. Victorio Velasco,
after earning a degree in journalism, was shunted into cannery work and
farm labor in Seattle. He went on to edit Filipino community newspapers
that were critical to creating a collective Filipino workers' political
voice. Chris Mensalvas quit law school because, as a U.S. "noncitizen
national" from the Philippines, he was prohibited from practicing law.
"I spent three years in college and then I went to organize our people
on the farms."\[7\] Trinidad Rojo, who completed his PhD in sociology at
Stanford University, became president of the Cannery Workers' and Farm
Laborers' Union in 1939. Their work became one root of the United Farm
Worker movement best associated with Dolores Huerta and Cesar Chavez.
The technological fact of the matter is that Rojo, Mensalves, Standing
Bear, and wa Thiong'o are scyborg, and their flights through the
colonial assemblages reveal a warp in the patterning of power. Scyborgs
are possible "men" fit for assimilation---the colonial hope is that the
whiteness of the normative human can be extended to the very people who
were premised as non-human, gender-deviant savages. Thus I have selected
these male examples to bring attention to how, upon entry into
schooling, they were all already premised as not men. Natives must get
haircuts and Western suits; African boys need to be converted into
Christian men; even with suits and Christian names, Filipino men were
feared as sexual contagions in white working-class society. You can
infer how these same masculinizing technologies are appended onto those
of you who are not cis-men and how, despite your colonial equipment, you
will never become a complete colonialist stud. The first world
university wants you to become masculine in the most disciplined sense
of the word and will provide you with the necessary prosthesis and will
cut off your tail. But you, as scyborg, might use these technologies to
bend the fabric of power to suit your decolonial desires. Are you
scyborg? is not an ontological question. It is a technological reality.
In formulating the scyborg, I am attempting to connect the person---the
being---with the web of intentions beyond the being. In a crude sense, I
am connecting agency and structure---although I despise that duality.
Structure as a term by itself has useful explanatory value. I see
structure as a limited analytic about how power works. I see agency as a
discourse preoccupied with individual freedom within a structuralist
analysis. To be sure, there are theorizations of agency that do not
participate in this preoccupation, ones that theorize agency as a
capacity for action that is enabled by systems. However, I am
problematizing the general usage of the term agency as a hopeful
signifier for resistance. Such positioning is an individualistic theory
of change, wherein collective agency is relegated to a mass of
individuals operating in unison. That kind of "collective" springs from
a theory of individuals.\[8\] By contrast, [the scyborg springs from
assemblage]{.underline}. To speak of scyborgs as autonomous, unplugged
individuals is meaningless. It only makes sense to discuss the scyborg
as plugged in to technological grids. The scyborg is [inherently a
plurality and only occasionally becomes singular when a condensation of
machines produces intentionality]{.underline}---**[hopefully a
decolonial intentionality]{.underline}**, such as a third world
university. Fortunately, the decolonial spirit is also personal, [and it
does not always await a mass mobilization or an ignited fire of the
people]{.underline} (as anticolonial revolution is often [portrayed). It
happens at the scales of cells, tissues, organs, rhizomes---it is the
person and the transpersonal. It is always happening]{.underline}. So
conceptualized, the scyborg may be personal in scale but is wired into
telescoping scales of the assemblage. In considering the plugged-in
scyborg, I am drawing from foundational femtech thinkers who established
how the cyborgian body extends beyond the organic boundaries of the
person: for example, when you troll someone online, your agential self
extends well beyond your skin, across space and beyond corporeality, via
your plugs in technological assemblages. Furthermore, "self" is not only
extended by technology but can also be divided, fractured, and tapped by
it---as in the case of disaggregating the fetus from the mother and womb
through ultrasound, or in transnational surrogacy, call centers, and the
technology-assisted ways that Global South people's vital energies are
sapped and redistributed to support the lives of the Global North.\[9\]
So the scyborg for me, as a "being" who is only analytically meaningful
when we consider your entanglements in the machinery of assemblages, is
a fitting way to discuss structural agency.\[10\] The scyborg is a being
who is in no way discretely individual. A scyborg is a being in
assemblage. Your agential capacity extends beyond your being, into the
system's capacity. [Your agency is system]{.underline}. This is why I
put the s in front of cyborg. Scyborg is not an identity. Although I am
addressing you, as scyborg, I understand that you are a very plural
group of beings. Being scyborg does not describe your total reality.
Scyborgs are not total beings, nor whole beings, nor perfectly discrete
beings for that matter. Scyborg is not ontological. Scyborg is more like
an adjective.\[11\] It describes a technological condition of being
embedded in an assemblage of machines. Different scyborgs have different
powers in shaping assemblage. What your particular powers are is
important for you to figure out. Certainly most of us are scyborg, but
of particular interest to me is the scyborg who is embedded in the
university, who assembles decolonial machines. The university is in
assemblage. One might consider how (1) the university is an assemblage.
It is a giant machine composed of myriad working parts, multiple
systems. Each part can still be thought of as a discrete organism to be
unplugged and replugged somewhere else. (2) The university is in
assemblage.\[12\] It is imbricated with other assemblages. [The
university assemblage is connected to the **military--industrial
complex**, itself another assemblage]{.underline}. At my university, UC
San Diego, we have particularly intimate connections with the U.S. Navy.
One can easily see how the military--industrial and academic--industrial
complexes are in assemblage in terms of engineering contracts with the
military; the ways that anthropologists might be recruited to serve as
cultural consultants for the military; or how Arabic- and Farsi-speaking
undergraduates are actively recruited by the CIA. The university is in
assemblage with other corporate capitalist assemblages, such as
pharmaceutical and high-tech industries. It is, like all assemblages,
discrete from yet amalgamated with other assemblages in an endless
matrix of couplings. (3) As assemblages, the priorities of "scale," as
captured in the conventional hierarchical dichotomies of micro versus
macro, historical versus ephemeral, data versus anecdote, echo into one
another. So a small glimpse into a university classroom very quickly
telescopes into scales of heterosexism, racial capitalism, and so on.
The webs of pedagogical machinery are at once giant and intimate. It may
feel like lying face down on a monumental precipice, close enough to see
the cracks in the stone as well as the chasm just centimeters away. I
think this is why some scyborgs feel vertigo in the college classroom.
[Your vertigo is your intuition speaking. You are sensing how power "in
your face" is jointed to global latticeworks of power]{.underline}. As
Simon Leung reminds us, state-legitimated force is felt at the scale of
the visage and the viscera: "The look of law: It's on your face. It's on
your case. It's down your throat. It's up your ass. That is, if your ass
has not been rendered to disappear altogether."\[13\] Julie Burelle
notes that "moments of vertiginous consciousness" are these sudden
apprehensions of the fatal couplings of the personal and structural
scales: "a sensation of sudden clarity, a sinking of the solar plexus if
you will, about the violence that continues to hold one's
settler-colonial privilege in place."\[14\] Ruth Wilson Gilmore pushes
us to analyze the geographies of these "fatal couplings of power and
difference" as multiscalar. For Gilmore, the "warfare state is also the
racial-gendered state," as the industrial kill ings of racialized enemy
others are jointed to the domestication of racial-gendered industries
within the state. Thus who you are is not at all distant from power that
is exercised on bodies and lands geographically distant from your body.
The goal is "to figure out what \[and who\] makes oppressive and
liberatory structures work, and what \[and who\] makes them fall
apart."\[15\] Just as Gilmore seeks a multiscalar object of analysis, I
seek a multiscalar subject of power.\[16\] Scyborg agency is
multiscalar; the witch's flight is the ripple in the patterning of
power. [The scyborg's medium is assemblage]{.underline}. When we take
assemblages seriously as both analytical of power and as the medium for
it, then the question becomes, **[how do you hack
assemblages]{.underline}**? [The scyborg is a sculptor]{.underline} of
assemblage\[17\]---[s-he splices one machine to another]{.underline},
[de/links apparatuses]{.underline} from/to one another, places machines
to work in making new machines, [disassembles and
reassembles]{.underline} the machine. The scyborg can connect Black
radical thought to the paper-producing academic--industrial complex and
set the print command to "manifesto." The scyborg is like R2D2 in the
Death Star, [opening escape tunnels, lowering and raising doors to new
passageways]{.underline}, **[making the death machine run
backward]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} ultimately **[releasing the
plans for its destruction]{.underline}**.\[18\] The scyborg is an artist
in the un/patterning of relations of power.\[19\] The scyborg loves
dirty work.\[20\] [Scyborgs do not care whether the assemblage they are
retooling is first, second, or third world]{.underline}. **[Categorical
thinking is not the point]{.underline}**. [Nothing is too
dirty]{.underline} for scyborg dreaming: **[MBA programs, transnational
capital, Department of Defense grants.]{.underline}** Scyborgs are
ideology-agnostic, which creates possibilities in every direction of the
witch's flight---not just possibilities that we like. This is why some
of you are not always decolonial in behavior. Thankfully, your newly
assembled machine will break down. [Some]{.underline} other scyborgs
will [reassemble the busted gears to drive decolonial
dreams]{.underline}. To dream it is to ride the ruin.

#### Anti-statism condemns those crushed by the state---being pragmatic isn't synonymous with selling out.

**Day 9** (Christopher, The Historical Failure of Anarchism:
Implications for the Future of the Revolutionary Project,
ttp://mikeely.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/historical_failure_of_aanarchism_chris_day_kasama.pdf)

The strength of anarchism is its moral insistence on the primacy of
human freedom over political expediency. But human freedom exists in a
political context[. It is not sufficient, however, to simply take the
**most uncompromising position** in defense of freedom. It is neccesary
to **actually win** freedom]{.underline}. Anti-capitalism doesn't do the
victims of capitalism any good if you don't actually destroy capitalism.
[Anti-statism doesn't do the victims of the state any good if you
**don't actually smash the state**. Anarchism has been very good at
putting forth visions of a free society and that is for the good. But it
is worthless if we don't develop an actual strategy for realizing those
visions.]{.underline} It is not enough to be right, we must also win.
[Continues... Finally, revolutionaries have a responsibility to have a
plausible plan for making revolution. Obviously, there are not enough
revolutionaries to make a revolution at this moment.]{.underline} We can
reasonably anticipate that the future will bring upsurges in popular
opposition to the existing system. Without being any more specific about
where those upsurges might occur it seems clear that it is from the
ranks of such upsurges that the numbers of the revolutionary movement
will be increased, eventually leading to a revolutionary situation
(which is distinguished from the normal crises of the current order only
by the existence of a revolutionary movement ready to push things
further). People who are fed up with the existing system and who are
willing to commit themselves to its overthrow will look around for
likeminded people who have an idea of what to do. If we don't have a
plausible plan for making revolution we can be sure that there will be
somebody else there who will. [There is no guarantee that
revolutionary-minded people will be spontaneously drawn to
anti-authoritarian politics.]{.underline} The plan doesn't have to be an
exact blueprint. It shouldn't be treated as something sacred. It should
be subject to constant revision in light of experience and debate. But
at the very least it needs to be able to answer questions that have been
posed concretely in the past. We know that we will never confront the
exact same circumstances as previous revolutions. But we should also
know that certain problems are persistent ones and that if we can't say
what we would have done in the past we should not expect people to think
much of our ability to face the future

#### You can use normative statements about the state to highlight its failures, which doesn't indoctrinate us or reaffirm its legitimacy

**Newman, 10** \[Saul, Reader in Political Theory at Goldsmiths, U of
London, Theory & Event Volume 13, Issue 2\]

There are two aspects that I would like to address here. Firstly, the
notion of demand: [making certain demands on the state]{.underline} --
say [for ]{.underline}higher wages, equal rights for excluded groups, to
not go to war, or [an end to draconian policing -- is one of the basic
strategies of social movements and radical groups. Making such
demands does not necessarily mean]{.underline} working within the state
or [reaffirming its legitimacy. On the contrary, demands are made from a
position outside the political order, and they often exceed the question
of the implementation of this or that specific
measure. They implicitly call into question the legitimacy and even the
sovereignty of the state by
highlighting fundamental inconsistencies between, for instance, a formal
constitutional order which guarantees certain rights and equalities, and
state practices which in reality violate and deny them]{.underline}.
