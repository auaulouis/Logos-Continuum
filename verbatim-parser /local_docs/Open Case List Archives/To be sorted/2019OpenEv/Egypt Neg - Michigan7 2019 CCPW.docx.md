### 1NC -- Egypt Diversifying

#### Egypt is diversifying its arms suppliers now AND U.S. flip-flops mean all credibility is already gone

Earlier this month, La Tribune reported that **[France and Egypt are
moving forward on negotiations for another sale of Dassault Rafale
fighter jets to the Egyptian Air Force]{.underline}**.\[i\] Cairo and
Paris are said to be negotiating on a new agreement for the sale of up
to two dozen Rafales to Egypt, on top of the initial group of 24 ordered
in 2015. Furthermore, Egypt may procure another two Gowind 2500
corvettes and is interested in French drones and helicopters. **[The
deepening Egyptian-French relationship comes as the volume of U.S. sales
to Egypt has waned]{.underline}**. In 2013, in the months after the
Egyptian military overthrew President Mohamed Morsi, the U.S. announced
a hold on the sale of "certain large-scale military systems" and
military assistance to Egypt, "pending credible progress toward an
inclusive, democratically elected civilian government through free and
fair elections."\[ii\] The U.S. continued the sale of spare parts for
previously supplied systems, but otherwise suspended the delivery of
major hardware, largely in line with U.S. law regarding military
coups,\[iii\] though the Obama administration did not formally
acknowledge Morsi's overthrow as such. **[Less than two years later, the
U.S. reversed its position]{.underline}**. Notably, **[this decision
followed the Egyptian presidential elections in 2014 that delivered 95
percent of the vote to President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\[iv\] Perhaps in
recognition that President Sisi was here to stay, and worried about
damage to the long-term U.S.-Egypt alliance]{.underline}**, U.S.
President Barack Obama announced in March 2015 that he would "lift
executive holds that have been in place since October 2013 on the
delivery of F-16 aircraft, Harpoon missiles, and M1A1 tank kits."\[v\]
**[This reversal in policy came without any of the intended changes in
Egypt that the Obama administration had initially sought.]{.underline}**
Even so, despite the end of the self-imposed suspension, the U**[.S. has
for the most part not been able to cash in on major arms sales to
Egypt]{.underline}**. Maintenance and overhaul support continue, landing
regular work for American firms, and some new deals have been reached.
In September 2016, for example, the U.S. State Department approved the
sale of eight MPQ-64F1 Sentinel radars to Egypt, and in November 2017,
Raytheon received a contract to produce the radars for Cairo.\[vi\] But
since President Sisi took office, **[Egypt has turned to Russia and
France for the big force modernization contracts]{.underline}**. From
Russia, Egypt purchased dozens of MiG-29M/M2 fighter jets and Ka-52
attack helicopters. The Egyptian military introduced Antey-2500
surface-to-air missile systems into service and is to procure T-90S/SK
main battle tanks. France has sold Mistral helicopter carriers
(initially destined for Russia) to Egypt, along with a FREMM frigate,
several Gowind 2500 corvettes, and Rafale fighter jets. Further
contracts with both countries are planned, and these sales will deepen
Egypt's bilateral relations with these countries for years to come.
**[Egypt's turn to France and Russia for arms sales demonstrates several
important features of the arms trade in general.]{.underline}**
**[President Sisi's ability to buy from suppliers other than the U.S.
limited Washington's ability to directly pressure his decision-making on
a sensitive subject]{.underline}**, that being the nature of Egyptian
elections. The success of a Muslim Brotherhood candidate in 2012 spooked
the Egyptian military leadership, which in the aftermath of Morsi's
ouster has not been amenable to a repeat democracy experiment. The
Brookings Institution's Shadi Hamid observed that the 2013 massacre of
supporters of deposed President Morsi signaled the end of the "Arab
Spring" itself.\[vii\] Rather than bow to American pressure on an issue
core to his domestic concerns, President Sisi chose to lessen his
dependence on Washington by inking multibillion-dollar arms contracts
with American arms competitors. **[Diversifying arms suppliers is a
financially expensive endeavor and can lead to interoperability issues
within a military and between partner militaries. But politically, it
allows flexibility and preserves a measure of independence from any one
supplier in particular. Furthermore, American national security
interests prevented Washington from more aggressively pressuring
Cairo.]{.underline}** The 2013 hold on arms sales noticeably exempted
the supply of spare parts and support. **[Completely cutting off
military assistance to Egypt was out of the question, however, as doing
so would result in both short-term damage to the Egyptian military and
long-term damage to U.S.-Egyptian relations. In the short term, Egypt's
military readiness would take a hit. Egypt is engaged in a
counterinsurgency effort against Islamic State-linked militants in the
Sinai and these operations would be negatively impacted were Egypt
unable to continue receiving support for its American-supplied
equipment.]{.underline}** With quiet cooperation from Israel, Egypt has
made use of heavy equipment in the Sinai, such as American-supplied
F-16s and Apache helicopters,\[viii\] to combat militant groups. Over
the longer term, as a direct consequence of meddling in Egyptian
military readiness, the **[U.S. would have been perceived at best as an
untrustworthy supplier and poor security partner, cementing an Egyptian
shift to partners perceived to be more reliable. Washington's ability to
influence Egypt on humanitarian matters, always tenuous, would further
erode. In understanding of Egypt's strategic importance, the U.S. is
keenly interested in returning to the Egyptian market as part of a
policy under U.S. President Donald Trump to promote arms sales, and may
be able to score contracts with the Egyptian military, as numerous
Egyptian modernization requirements remain]{.underline}**. **[To do so,
however, the U.S. may be seeking to limit Egypt's ability to buy from
both France and Russia.]{.underline}** Dassault CEO Éric Trappier
suggested in a March 2018 interview that he viewed **[American
roadblocks]{.underline}** to the sale of Rafales to Egypt as indicative
of the U.S.'s desire to return to the Egyptian market.\[ix\] These
blocks, according to La Tribune, which has followed Egypt-France arms
deals closely, have since been lifted in the wake of high-level French
protests, allowing the sale to move forward. At least in theory, Egypt
could be subject to sanctions under the U.S.'s Countering America's
Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which came into force earlier this
year,\[x\] over purchases of Russian military equipment. **[Given the
benefit that President Sisi has found in diversifying suppliers,
however, his government may react negatively to American efforts to cut
Egypt off from other sources. U.S. pressure helped spur Egypt to seek
other suppliers; it is doubtful that further pressure will undo this
shift.]{.underline}**

#### France, Germany, and Russia are the leading arms providers in Egypt, the plan is only a drop in the bucket.

**[Between 2013 and 2017,]{.underline}** **[France surpassed the United
States as the top provider of arms to Egypt,]{.underline}** **[providing
almost 4 billion euros in supplies. This shift reflects major sales by
France, including a deal to deliver 24 Rafale jets in
2015]{.underline}**. Between 2013 and 2017**[, several European
countries---most notably France and Germany, along with Russia---have
provided Egypt with over \$4.2 billion in arms sales]{.underline}**.
This was a drastic change in arms sales when compared to the time period
between 2008 and 2012, during which European countries sold \$906
million in arms. The sales of arms to Egypt has yielded backlash,
particularly given European countries' perceived silence and relative
inaction on human rights abuses and repressive measures in Egypt**[.
Europe has dramatically increased its arms sales to Egypt over the past
five years. In Germany, despite criticism]{.underline}** from leftist
German parties **[on the sale of arms to governments that commit human
rights abuses]{.underline}**, **[arms sales to Egypt increased by 205
percent]{.underline}** **[between 2013 and 2017, as compared to the
period between 2008 and 2012]{.underline}**. **[French arms sales to
Egypt have also followed a similar upward trend, surpassing for the
first time even U.S. arms sales over a five-year period]{.underline}**.
Notably, in April 2016, **[France and Egypt signed an arms deal that
includes Rafale fighter aircraft, Mistral-class navy vessels, and a
military satellite system, part of larger set of agreements regarding
energy, defense, and security that]{.underline}** **[are valued at
\$2.26 billion]{.underline}**. **[Over \$1.2 billion in arms agreements
have been made between Russia and Egypt during 2016 and
2017]{.underline}**, and the two countries signed a five-year,
reciprocal arrangement in November 2017, **[allowing Russian military
planes to use Egyptian military bases and air space]{.underline}**. In
the past decade, global arms markets have changed significantly. Whereas
major **[Western European arms dealers]{.underline}** once sold almost
exclusively to NATO allies and other European states, they **[have now
shifted their focus to the Middle East and North Africa]{.underline}**.
Since 2012, the global arms market has not grown in agreement or
delivery values, and thus the increased competition to dominate the
market has made MENA an attractive target market. In the period between
2013 and 2017, **[Egypt was ranked the second largest recipient of arms
transfers in the Middle East behind Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**,
**[largely because of purchases from Western Europe. While the U.S. and
Russia have maintained their dominance of global market share, Western
Europe has increased its share dramatically.]{.underline}** Between 2014
and 2016, Western European arms dealers (mainly France, Italy, Germany,
and the United Kingdom) increased their sales from 9 percent of the
market to over 25 percent. **[France alone has had the largest value
increase in global weapons agreements, making it the third largest arms
exporter in the world,]{.underline}** behind only the U.S. and Russia.
But the sale of weapons to MENA countries, including Egypt, has also
caused backlash. Human rights groups such as Amnesty International have
alleged that the sale of military and policing arms to Egypt make their
sellers complicit in unlawful killings, forced disappearances, and
torture. Because of media and monitoring restrictions within the
country, it is often difficult to evaluate the end use of specific
materiel. However, there have been confirmations of the Egyptian
military and police forces using U.S.-manufactured F-16 fighter jets,
Apache helicopter gunships, tanks and other personnel carriers, and
pistols and rifles, including in operations that have resulted in
civilian casualties. The use of U.S.- and U.K.-manufactured tear gas, as
well as Italian-manufactured bullets, against protesters has been
extensively documented. Additionally, a recent report by Amnesty
International details the use of French-supplied Sherpa and MIDS armored
vehicles during the August 2013 Raba'a al-Adaweya sit-in dispersal. In
2013, the European Union enacted an arms embargo on Egypt to combat
"internal repression" and extreme violence in the country; the embargo
was reaffirmed in 2014. Then, in 2016, in the wake of the suspicious and
brutal murder of Italian student Giulio Regeni, the European Parliament
passed a nonbinding resolution that called for the cessation of security
cooperation of any kind. Since then however, 12 of 28 E.U. member
states, most notably **[France and Germany, have continued to sell small
and large arms to Egypt. The growing sales between Europe and Egypt can
be read both as Egypt diversifying its arms sources and Europe's need
for markets in the Middle East]{.underline}**. In the case of the
former, **[Egypt is searching for alternative streams of military
financing beyond the U.S.,]{.underline}** **[particularly given the
strained relationship that occurred under President Barack
Obama]{.underline}**, **[who temporarily stalled the delivery of F-16
fighter jets and Apache helicopters (and suspended Bright Star military
exercises).]{.underline}** Although cold relations have thawed under
President Donald Trump's administration, members of Congress, and
particularly those in the Senate, have become increasingly critical of
the \$1.3 billion in military aid that flows to Egypt annually. This has
precipitated in the form of holds by Senate appropriators and
legislation that increases the percentage of military assistance that is
contingent upon Egypt's compliance with democracy and human rights
conditions. Egypt has found more than willing suppliers in Europe and
Russia. **[Most European countries readily view sales as positive for
the domestic revenues that they generate. As noted, the Middle East has
rapidly increased its purchase of weapons, becoming a new and welcome
market for the defense industry worldwide, and Egypt is no outlier.
Particularly in the case of Russia, the strengthening of relations with
Egypt not only provides revenue to supplement an economy that has been
struggling as a result of U.S. sanctions]{.underline}**, but relations
also yield gains in regional political influence. As Russia seeks to
expand its influence beyond Syria and into the broader Middle East, it
has looked to Egypt as a strategic ally in the region. For Cairo,
although still far from the military strength it once enjoyed during the
1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, the growing relations with countries such as
Russia and France have emboldened Egypt to market itself as a key player
in the region and on the international stage.

BEIRUT --- Four years after Egyptian President **[Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi
took charge of managing the country's affairs, dozens of military-owned
companies have flourished and the Army has undergone a rapid military
buildup,]{.underline}** a reflection of Egypt's efforts to return to
prestige. To strengthen this progress, el-Sissi stressed in July the
importance of continuing the development of companies and factories
affiliated with the Ministry of Military Production, as well as
enhancing the national industry, exporting surplus production and
developing military products to cover the needs of the Armed Forces.
**[He also underlined the need to boost cooperation between the ministry
and major global companies to acquire modern technology and bolster
local innovation]{.underline}**. Assuming the president's plans are a
success, **[Egypt could expand its defense-industrial base beyond
domestic requirements, and toward global competition. Military-technical
cooperation between Egypt and other countries]{.underline}** --- mainly
Russia, China and the United States (the two former of which have an
interest in dislodging the latter's influence in the Middle East) ---
has reached "an unprecedented level during the last two years,"
according to Mohamed al-Kenany, a researcher at the Arab Forum for
Iranian Policy Analysis. "This period has witnessed a number of frequent
visits and meetings between the minister of military production, Mohamed
el Assar, and a number of defense ministers, ambassadors and heads of
international defense companies," he said. And those strong
relationships have translated into global cooperation, explained Ahmed
Kamel al-Beheiri, an expert in regional security issues at the Al-Ahram
Center for Political and Strategic Studies. "This \[is reflected\] by
the transfer of experience with the Russians in the air defense systems
field, Germany in the maritime manufacturing and light weapons domain,
and China through unmanned aerial vehicles and its complementary
technology," he said. In terms of potential domestic production,
al-Beheiri noted that **[Egypt is currently working a strategy to
increase capabilities "through a joint cooperation with international
companies for the transfer and localization of both hard and soft
technologies within the military forces arsenal -- especially one that
concerns the air defense missile field."]{.underline}** "**[In addition,
manufacturing light and medium weapons is considered a vital realm to
the Egyptians nowadays]{.underline}**," he added. In terms of exporting
some potential weapons, al-Beheiri sees potential in the near future,
especially as "**[Egypt has already begun exporting some types of
weapons to both African and Arab countries]{.underline}**, such as
Iraq." It's not just the big nations with which Egypt is looking to
partner. Al-Kenany noted that South Africa's Paramount Group has been in
talks with the Egyptian government for several months, with an eye on
expanding "**[Egypt's military manufacturing capabilities and strengthen
its status as an arms export source for several African
countries]{.underline}**." **[That could include establishing a modern
defense complex to produce various military equipment]{.underline}**,
including armored vehicles.

#### France overtook the US as Egypts main arms supplier, the plan is only a drop in the bucket.

On January 27, **[President Emmanuel Macron began his first official
visit to Egypt. Relations between the two countries and presidents have
never been warmer. Macron has justified France's support for Egypt,
despite the well documented human rights abuses by President Abdel
Fattah al-Sisi's government]{.underline}**, by saying that France
considers Egypt a bulwark against terrorism. Macron has gone as far as
to say that "Egypt's security is France's security." In the name of this
friendship, **[France has sold many weapons to Egypt, overtaking the US
to become Egypt's main arms supplier between 2013 and
2017]{.underline}**. In 2017 alone, **[it delivered more than EUR 1.4
billion worth of military and security equipment. France has provided
warships, fighter jets, and armored vehicles,]{.underline}** while
French companies -- with the government's approval - have provided
surveillance and crowd control tools. Last December in Cairo, French
Defense Minister Florence Parly cut the ribbon with al-Sisi for Egypt's
first arms show. When Macron has been criticized for his support for
al-Sisi, his answer has been that he wants to be pragmatic and "does not
want to lecture" al-Sisi on human rights. But the issue here is not
about France lecturing Egypt or a case of naïve activists unaware of the
security risks in Egypt. **[The issue is about France directly enabling
abuses and not respecting its own international obligations regulating
arms sales]{.underline}**, **[which prohibit arms transfers to countries
where there is a substantial risk that they could be used to commit or
facilitate serious violations]{.underline}**. **[The French authorities
contend that they have only licensed military equipment as part of the
"fight against terrorism" in Egypt and not for law enforcement
operations]{.underline}**. But as recent reports by Amnesty
International and FIDH have demonstrated, **[French-supplied armored
vehicles were used by Egyptian security forces to violently disperse
peaceful sit-ins across the country]{.underline}**. Amnesty
International noted, "French vehicles were not merely assisting the
security forces, but were themselves tools of repression, playing a very
active role in the crushing of dissent." In response to the criticism,
the French government argues that such exports were intended for the
Egyptian military, not the police. **[But France should have monitored
the use of weapons and equipment it exported, and there is no evidence
that France put a stop to the weapons transfers once it became clear
that Egypt had diverted their use]{.underline}**. In addition to its
direct support for the military and police, the French government has
authorized **[French companies to sell Egyptian authorities various
surveillance systems for intercepting communications and controlling
social movements.]{.underline}** The Egyptian state's ever-expanding
surveillance has been used to target human rights and labor activists,
LGBT people, political activists, and academics. Al-Sisi's fear of
social movements is so deep that in December his government even banned
the sale of yellow vests in fear of copycat protests in advance of the
anniversary of the 2011 uprising. Even France's claims that al-Sisi is
essential to the fight against terrorism looks shaky on closer
inspection. Egypt is indeed facing a dangerous insurgency by extremist
fighters in the northern Sinai Peninsula, a historically marginalized
territory. But the way the Egyptian security forces have countered this
insurgency has been a textbook case of abuses that have not just
violated human rights but alienated large segments of the local
population that these actions are supposed to protect. Egyptian forces
carried out unlawful mass destruction of homes and forcible evictions of
tens of thousands of residents in northern Sinai with little or no help
or temporary accommodation for the people forced out of their homes.
Human Rights Watch's research shows that the Egyptian military and
police have carried out widespread arbitrary arrests, enforced
disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial killings, in northern Sinai
while attempting to conceal these abuses through restrictions on
independent reporting. Residents of the area told us that they no longer
knew whom to trust. **[France is happy to whitewash these abuses in the
name of the fight against terrorism. In other parts of Egypt, the
situation is not much better]{.underline}**. Torture and enforced
disappearances occur regularly, and overcrowded prisons with brutal
detention conditions are becoming breeding grounds for radicalization,
former inmates say. Meanwhile, Egyptian authorities have used the cover
of counterterrorism to go after all forms of dissent. Egypt has not only
banned the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization, but also
secular groups like the April 6 Youth Movement, an activist group that
played a key role in the protests organized against Hosni Mubarak in
2011. A March 2018 video by the Interior Ministry portrays a threat to
Egypt's security emanating from groups ranging from ISIS to human rights
groups, including Human Rights Watch. By offering unconditional and
uncritical support, France has made it harder to get Egypt to revisit
its current approach. Despite the government's massive military efforts,
northern Sinai residents hardly feel more secure. Many displaced by the
violence in past years have reported losing hope of going back home.
According to data compiled by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data
Project (ACLED), the number of armed violent events in Egypt nearly
doubled between November and December 2018 due to the escalation of the
fighting between Egyptian forces and the Islamic State. According to
ACLED, Egypt became the third-most-active country in terms of violence
on the African continent in December, after Somalia and Nigeria. In this
context, one wonders who is being naïve in their approach to Egypt. The
human rights groups who are documenting an out of control "war on
terror" that seems to be creating more enemies by the day or a French
government which keeps throwing weapons at a problem that seems to be
getting worse? No one is asking President Macron to lecture al-Sisi, but
rather to meet his own obligations to respect human rights. France
should suspend all sales and provision of security-related items and
assistance to Egypt until the government ends serious human rights
violations, and Macron's government should introduce effective end-use
monitoring to ensure that France is not complicit in grave crimes.

CAIRO (AP) --- **[Egypt's first international weapons fair wrapped up
Wednesday, giving the major arms purchaser vast opportunities to
diversify its weapons sources]{.underline}** while hosting an event in
the booming industry's hottest region, where conflicts rage from Libya
to Yemen. **[The three-day]{.underline}** Egypt Defence **[Expo
saw]{.underline}** nearly **[400 exhibition stands and some 10,000
military and defense visitors from over 40 countries]{.underline}**.
**[The fair was]{.underline}** billed to the public as **[an event to
boost the country's prestige on the world stage and project an image of
security]{.underline}**. It also sought to draw big-ticket buyers from
oil-and-gas rich Gulf countries and set up an additional platform for an
increasing number of global weapons traders. Details on new agreements
or sales resulting from the show have yet to be announced, and officials
were tight-lipped about figures considered state secrets in Egypt, where
the military has been a dominant force in politics since independence.
**[Egypt is fighting an Islamic State-led insurgency in the Sinai
Peninsula and expends considerable military resources
there]{.underline}**. **[The country has been the world's fourth largest
arms importer in recent years,]{.underline}** and **[officials say they

local production, and even start to market some locally produced
equipment.]{.underline}** "**[Egypt is no longer]{.underline}** quite so
**[reliant on the U.S. for military equipment and has been turning to
other suppliers,"]{.underline}** said Ben Moores, a defense and aviation
analyst for Jane's. "**[An event like this provides an opportunity for
those newer suppliers to find contacts." Egypt has a very rapidly
growing backlog of un-awarded contracts and will likely import some \$9
billion in weapons over the coming decade,]{.underline}** he added.
**[That makes it the seventh largest market going forward with vast
amounts of equipment scheduled to be replaced. Sellers therefore will be
seeking to influence those decisions.]{.underline}** For decades, the
U.S. has been Egypt's largest weapons supplier, with an annual \$1.3
billion in military aid. But **[Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, the
general-turned president who came to power at the head of a military
overthrow of an elected but divisive Islamist predecessor,
has]{.underline}** **[vowed to diversify the country's suppliers,
and]{.underline}** now even **[holds joint military exercises with U.S.
rival Russia. Arms purchases from Europe as well as Russia and China
have surged]{.underline}**, boosted by billions of dollars in aid from
el-Sissi's wealthy Gulf backers in recent years, and **[there are no
signs the new trends will change anytime soon. Concerns over the
country's appalling human rights record have done little to dent the
sales, despite occasional condemnations from West]{.underline}**ern
capitals.

In his five years in office, [Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi
has been able to count on France as a trustworthy arms supplier during
one of the most troubled periods in his country's history.]{.underline}
A report published by several NGOs - including the International
Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), the Cairo Institute for Human Rights
Studies, the League of Human Rights and the Observatory of Weaponry
(OBSARM) -- on Monday claimed that ["the French state and several French
companies have participated in the bloody Egyptian repression of the
last five years". The relationship between French arms manufacturers and
the Egyptian state under Sisi began soon after the former defence
minister took power on 3 July, 2013.]{.underline} On 12 August that
year - two days before the Egyptian army's crackdown on protesters in
Rabaa al-Adawiya Square, during which more than 800 people were killed -
[French company Manurhin, a leading manufacturer of ammunition-producing
machinery, was due to deliver a machine to manufacture 20mm and 40mm
cartridges, which can be used for both rubber-coated steel bullets and
tear gas canisters, to the Egyptian government]{.underline}. However,
just before the state-of-the-art equipment was due to be delivered,
French customs blocked the transfer, following the escalation of
demonstrations sparked by the coup against President Mohamed Morsi.
[French and European arms exports to Egypt were suspended for a few
months, only to start anew after Sisi took office, with considerable
attention paid to a large-scale project meant to modernise the Egyptian
army]{.underline} - with the support of substantial Saudi funding. [The
Egyptian army purchased German U214 submarines, Russian Mig-29 fighter
jets and S-350 anti-aircraft missiles, but **French weapons
manufacturers' sales** also **boomed** at the time, with the orders of
Rafale fighter jets, a FREMM frigate, three Gowind corvettes, and
hundreds of armoured vehicles. Sisi's Egypt even helped France after
French company]{.underline} DCNS - now known as Naval Group - found
itself mired in a crisis with Moscow due to sanctions that led to
France's refusal to deliver two Mistral helicopter carriers to the
Russian navy. [Egypt swooped in to claim the two huge ships, worth more
than a billion euros]{.underline}, effectively saving DCNS. Moreover,
[French companies have also proven to be a great support in providing
systems to monitor Egyptians' daily lives.]{.underline} In their report,
the NGOs said by "equipping the Egyptian security and repression
services with powerful digital tools, \[France and its weapons
manufacturers\] have thereby participated in setting up an Orwellian
surveillance and control architecture, aimed at cracking down all
attempts at dissent and mobilisation". On 21 August, 2013, the European
Union called on its member states, including France, to suspend their
arms transfers to Egypt in order to prevent them from being used for
domestic repression purposes. But paradoxically, [France has never sold
and delivered so many weapons to Egypt in such a short time period as
since 2011. **The country became France's fourth-largest customer
between 2007 and 2016.**]{.underline} Under the cover of the war on
terror, and in spite the EU's call to member states and the 2008 EU
Common Position defining rules regarding the control of military
technology and equipment exports, France has continued to provide
weapons and devices that can be used for domestic security and
law-and-order purposes. According to the FIDH, at least eight French
companies, encouraged by successive governments, took advantage of the
situation in Egypt to reap record profits. Between 2010 and 2016, French
arms deliveries to Egypt rose from \$46m to \$1.5bn. While the European
Council announced the termination of military and surveillance equipment
exports in order to sanction the dictatorial drift in Egypt, France took
the opportunity to gain market share and achieve record exports," said
FIDH\'s president, Dimitris Christopoulos. Helicopter carriers and
espionage equipment In their relations with Egypt, French defence
companies can be classified into three categories. The first includes
heavy equipment suppliers whose weapons do not belong to police
arsenals, such as Naval Group, which has supplied two helicopter
carriers, a frigate and a corvette, and is preparing to assemble three
of them in Egypt: Dassault, with its Rafale; Sagem, with its
laser-guided bombs or its Patroller; and Thales UAV, with observation or
designation pods for fighter aircraft (Reco-NG and Talios). The second
category groups together companies that sell military equipment that can
be used for \"pacification\" and anti-terrorist operations. Renault
Trucks Defence - now known as Arquus - sold several hundred Sherpa tanks
to former Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak's regime and later pursued
cooperation with Sisi. [The third type of French company involved is the
more pernicious category of suppliers of espionage, surveillance and
internet censorship equipment, used to tap phones and shape public
opinion on social networks.]{.underline} The FIDH report, which draws in
part from OBSARM's work, identifies companies that have provided
Egyptian law enforcement and secret services with technologies for
individual surveillance (Amesys/Nexa/AM Systems), mass interception
(Suneris/Ercom), individual data collection (Idemia) and crowd control.
In doing so, these companies have participated in the construction of a
generalised surveillance and crowd control system, aimed at suppressing
any dissent or social movement and leading to the arrest of tens of
thousands of opponents and activists. While the 2011 Egyptian revolution
and the Arab Spring had been carried out by means of an ultraconnected
'Facebook generation' that mobilised crowds online, France is now
participating in the crushing of this generation through the
implementation of an Orwellian surveillance and control system aimed at
nipping in the bud any expression of protest," said Bahey Eddin Hassan,
president of the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, which also
collaborated on the FIDH report. How is the French government involved?
But why does the report associate the French state with what could
merely have been opportunistic business opportunities for French private
companies? In addition to the state being a shareholder in several major
French defence groups such as Thales or Safran, when financial packages
cause problems, the French president or prime minister will usually be
the one who can override the Egyptian government's solvency issues to
guarantee large contracts. The French government has paid half the
deposits for at least three major contracts: the Rafale aircrafts deal,
and the MBDA missiles and DCNS ships sales -- amounting to \$6.5bn.
Paris is directly involved due to the obligatory political validation of
weapons sales through the granting of export licences through the
Interministerial Commission for the Study of Exports of War Material
(CIEEMG). The CIEEMG is the only authority that assesses whether it is
possible to sell military equipment to a third country. Its primary
function is to prevent the dissemination of French technologies and ward
off copy-cats. It can also block sales in order to prevent specific
countries from gaining access to state-of-the-art technologies if doing
so would shift the balance of power with France and its allies. Finally,
it is designed to prevent the misuse of military technology by a third
country. The CIEEMG issues licences product by product, so that they can
be ready for purchase during calls for tender, then issues another
license for export in the event of a purchase order. The CIEEMG brings
together representatives from the ministries of defence, foreign
affairs, finance, higher education and interior, as well as the prime
minister's office and the president's special staff. The first three
representatives have discretionary powers over exports, while the others
may issue advisory opinions which will be taken into account in the
final decision. The system in place is evidence of the French
government's degree of involvement in the military equipment export
process. In publishing this report, the FIDH "calls on the French
government to immediately terminate these deadly exports and to set up a
parliamentary inquiry into arms deliveries to Egypt since 2013\". More
generally, the signatories of the report called once again for an
overhaul of the French system for the control of arms and surveillance
equipment exports, rendered ineffective by its opacity and dependence on
the executive branch.

#### France has doubled its weapons sales to Egypt.

PARIS (Reuters) - **[France's weapons sales to the Middle East doubled
in 2017, a government report showed, as President Emmanuel Macron defied
pressure from lawmakers and rights groups to curb arms flows to a region
mired in conflict. France is among the world's leading arms
exporters]{.underline}**, its sales surging in recent years on the back
of its first lucrative overseas contracts for Rafale fighter jets,
notably to India and Qatar, as well as a multi-billion submarine deal
with Australia. **[Paris has sought to increase its diplomatic weight in
the Middle East through the sale of naval vessels, tanks, artillery and
munitions to the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. The
government's annual report on weapons sales,]{.underline}** due to be
released on Wednesday, shows that France's total arms sales halved to 7
billion euros in 2017, in line with previous years where no major
contracts, such as for the Dassault-made Rafale, were recorded. However,
about 60 percent of sales went to the Middle East, with arms exports to
the region worth 3.92 billion euros compared to 1.94 billion euros a
year earlier. Sales to Saudi Arabia fell slightly, while deals to the
UAE, Kuwait and Qatar soared. France's biggest defense firms, including
Dassault and Thales, have major contracts with the Gulf. "It is not for
France to conclude piecemeal transactions depending on market
opportunities. The goal is to create a strong link with the importing
states," the report said. "France's arms exports meet the legitimate
needs of states**[." France is now the third largest arms exporter in
the world behind the United States and Russia, according to the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Unlike those of many
allies, France's export licensing procedures have no parliamentary
checks or balances]{.underline}**. They are approved by a committee
headed by the prime minister that includes the foreign, defense and
economy ministries. Details of licenses are not public and once approved
are rarely reviewed. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and some
lawmakers have urged Macron to scale back support for Arab states that
are part of a Saudi-led offensive in Yemen against fighters from the
Iranian-aligned Houthi movement that controls the capital. The French
government says its arms sales are governed by strict procedures that
are in line with international treaties. Four NGOs, including the
**[International Federation for Human Rights, on Monday accused the
French state and several French companies of tacitly participating in an
Egyptian government crackdown on opposition groups over the past five
years]{.underline}**. The report cited, among other things, the sale of
"personal surveillance, mass interception, personal data collection and
crowd control (\...) technologies that have led to the arrest of tens of
thousands of opponents or militants."

and the discontinuation of Egypt's]{.underline}** diplomatic, military,
and economic **[cooperation with North Korea]{.underline}**. This is
**[not the first time the United States has blinked during a faceoff
with]{.underline}** the notoriously stubborn government of **[Egyptian
President]{.underline}** Abdel-Fattah **[al-Sisi.]{.underline}** In
fact, I was the director for Egypt on the National Security Council

**[[lifted](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-egypt-military-idUSKBN0MR2GR20150401)
a hold on the delivery of several weapons systems even though Cairo had

**[conditions]{.underline}**. The **[decision led one former Obama

[lament](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/01/we-caved-obama-foreign-policy-legacy-213495)]{.underline}**
to Politico, "**[We caved]{.underline}**." In that case, Egypt's
regional allies---Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab
Emirates---had lobbied hard against the hold. With each of them
perceived to be more important to U.S. interests than Egypt, it is no
wonder that their opinions bore weight with President Barack Obama. The
discomfort of some U.S. government agencies, including the Department of
Defense, with applying pressure on a putative "friend" likewise tipped
the scales. Such pressures surely weighed down on the State Department
this time as well. But there's one major difference: Whereas the Obama
administration's hold on weapons systems had not produced changes in
Egyptian policy, the Trump administration's pressure appears to be
working. After stalling for five years, in April, Egypt's highest
appeals court finally
[ordered](https://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL4N1RI3I8)
a retrial in the 2013 NGO case. Meanwhile, the government has demurred
on implementing some provisions of the 2017 law regulating NGOs in
Egypt, such as the imposition of a tax on foreign grants. Administration
officials likewise assure me that Egypt has forced North Korea to reduce
the size of its embassy in Cairo (which was previously the country's
largest in the Middle East) and has apparently halted military
transactions with Kim Jong Un's government. **[By releasing military aid
before Egypt fully meets the United States' conditions,]{.underline}**
however, **[the Trump administration is inviting the Egyptian government

large.]{.underline}** After all, **[Sisi broke his

getting worse. Could withholding American military aid help?"\] \[DS\]
\[https://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-military-aid-egypt-20180815-story.html\]

**[The pattern over the last five years has been consistent: The U.S.
withholds military aid from Egypt, citing human rights concerns, only to
eventually release the funds before any substantial
improvement.]{.underline}** The first time was under President Obama's
administration in 2013. **[The United States suspended aid after Egypt's
first elected president, Mohamed Morsi, was ousted. Two years later,
Obama restored the annual \$1.3 billion in military
financing]{.underline}**, citing the need to help Egypt defeat Islamic
State militants in the Sinai province. It happened again most recently
under President Trump. **[After growing concern of repression
under]{.underline}** Egyptian President Abdel Fattah **[Sisi's
government, the Trump administration froze \$195 million in military
assistance to Cairo, only to release it at the end of July --- 11 months
later --- despite the Egyptian government not meeting U.S. conditions.
The failure of two administrations to sustain pressure on Sisi's
government despite worsening repression on civil society suggests that
American national security interests supersede human rights
concerns]{.underline}**, experts said. "**[The U.S. cares more about
security than human rights]{.underline}**," said Steven Cook, a senior
fellow for the Middle East at the Council on Foreign Relations. "It also
implies that **[suspending aid hasn't really done anything to improve
Egypt's human rights situation."]{.underline}** Since the late 1970s,
**[the U.S. has viewed Egypt as an important and powerful ally in the
Middle East. Part of maintaining that good-faith relationship has been
to provide Egypt with military aid.]{.underline}** Egypt is the
second-largest recipient of foreign military funding after Israel. Every
year the U.S. provides Egypt with \$1.3 billion in military assistance
that it uses to buy equipment and conduct training. A year ago,
then-Secretary of State **[Rex Tillerson froze]{.underline}** 15%, or
**[\$195 million]{.underline}**, of the total annual military aid **[and
conditioned its release on three points: Egypt must downgrade relations
with North Korea, repeal a law that restricts the work of
nongovernmental organizations and resolve the case of 43 NGO workers who
were convicted in 2013 of working illegally. Egypt and North Korea have
had friendly diplomatic and military relations for some time, including
weapons purchases from each other. A small number of the NGO workers
left the country after they were convicted but still face jail sentences
if they return to Egypt. Egypt's top appeal court ordered retrials for
16 people in April, but the outcome remains to be seen.]{.underline}**
The workers were employed by various unregistered NGOs, including U.S.
and German organizations. **[Less than a year after freezing the
military aid, on July 25, Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo lifted
the restrictions without specifying what progress, if any, has been
made. Releasing military assistance to Egypt without seeing improvements
in human rights taints the perception that the U.S. is serious in
holding Egypt accountable]{.underline}**, said Andrew Miller, deputy
director for policy at the Project on Middle East Democracy.
"**[Releasing the money removes pressure on the Egyptian government to
meet conditions that were originally attached to that
funding]{.underline}**," Miller said. "**[Egyptians will look back and
see that this is further evidence Americans aren't serious about human
rights concerns. It hurts the idea of using assistance to leverage
influence." The other time the U.S. froze military aid to Egypt was in
2013 over the bloody crackdown and repression of supporters of Morsi,
who was affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood]{.underline}**. He was
ousted by the military after massive demonstrations by Egyptians
concerned that Morsi was taking the country in an Islamist direction and
failing to solve its many problems. **[The Obama administration released
that military aid in 2015 to help Egypt fight Islamic State militants
who had established a toehold in the Sinai.]{.underline}** Since then
**[the human rights situation in Egypt has worsened. Egyptian officials
continue to lock up young activists who speak out against the government
as tens of thousands of political prisoners sit in jail. "U.S.
policymakers look at Sisi and say he may be a dictator but at least he's
taking care of Islamic State in the Sinai. They are willing to overlook
human rights violation to maintain security]{.underline}**," said Amr
Kotb, advocacy director at the Washington-based Tahrir Institute for
Middle East Policy. "**[The U.S. views human rights and national
security as mutually exclusive." The next time the U.S. decides to
withhold funds, it will have less impact, rights advocates and experts
warn.]{.underline}** "The administration fails to understand that the
status of human rights in Egypt has a direct impact on U.S. national
security interests, including counter-terrorism," Miller said. Miller
said there have been examples in which withholding aid has been
effective in the short term, such as pressuring Egypt to release
detained Egyptian Americans. "Military assistance holds are like
sanctions in that you're denying something with the hope that it changes
behavior," Miller said. "It's not instantaneous. **[Obama and Trump have
backed down from assistance holds and lifted them before they could have
an effect]{.underline}**," he said. "**[It reduces incentives from
Egypt. They don't believe our stance, and it prevents more significant

Earlier this month, La Tribune reported that **[France and Egypt are
moving forward on negotiations for another sale of Dassault Rafale
fighter jets to the Egyptian Air Force]{.underline}**.\[i\] Cairo and
Paris are said to be negotiating on a new agreement for the sale of up
to two dozen Rafales to Egypt, on top of the initial group of 24 ordered
in 2015. Furthermore, **[Egypt may procure another two Gowind 2500
corvettes and is interested in French drones and
helicopters]{.underline}**. **[The deepening Egyptian-French
relationship comes as the volume of U.S. sales to Egypt has
waned.]{.underline}** In 2013, in the months after the Egyptian military
overthrew President Mohamed Morsi, **[the U.S. announced a hold on the
sale of "certain large-scale military systems" and military assistance
to Egypt, "pending credible progress toward an inclusive, democratically
elected civilian government through free and fair
elections."\[]{.underline}**ii\] The U.S. continued the sale of spare
parts for previously supplied systems, but otherwise suspended the
delivery of major hardware, largely in line with U.S. law regarding
military coups,\[iii\] though the Obama administration did not formally
acknowledge Morsi's overthrow as such. **[Less than two years later, the
U.S. reversed its position]{.underline}**. Notably, this decision
followed the Egyptian presidential elections in 2014 that delivered 95
percent of the vote to President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\[iv\] Perhaps in
recognition that President Sisi was here to stay, and worried about
damage to the long-term U.S.-Egypt alliance, U.S. President Barack Obama
announced in March 2015 that he would "lift executive holds that have
been in place since October 2013 on the delivery of F-16 aircraft,
Harpoon missiles, and M1A1 tank kits."\[v\] This reversal in policy came
without any of the intended changes in Egypt that the Obama
administration had initially sought. Even so, despite the end of the
self-imposed suspension, **[the U.S. has for the most part not been able
to cash in on major arms sales to Egypt. Maintenance and overhaul
support continue, landing regular work for American firms, and some new
deals have been reached.]{.underline}** In September 2016, for example,
the U.S. State Department approved the sale of eight MPQ-64F1 Sentinel
radars to Egypt, and in November 2017, Raytheon received a contract to
produce the radars for Cairo.\[vi\] **[But since President Sisi took
office, Egypt has turned to Russia and France for the big force
modernization contracts. From Russia, Egypt purchased dozens of
MiG-29M/M2 fighter jets and Ka-52 attack helicopters. The Egyptian
military]{.underline}** introduced Antey-2500 surface-to-air missile
systems into service and is to procure T-90S/SK main battle tanks.
**[France has sold Mistral helicopter carriers (initially destined for
Russia) to Egypt]{.underline}**, along with a FREMM frigate, several
Gowind 2500 corvettes, and Rafale fighter jets. Further contracts with
both countries are planned, and these sales will deepen Egypt's
bilateral relations with these countries for years to come. **[Egypt's
turn to France and Russia for arms sales demonstrates several important
features of the arms trade in general]{.underline}**. **[President
Sisi's ability to buy from suppliers other than the U.S. limited
Washington's ability to directly pressure his decision-making on a
sensitive subject,]{.underline}** that being the nature of Egyptian
elections. The success of a Muslim Brotherhood candidate in 2012 spooked
the Egyptian military leadership, which in the aftermath of Morsi's
ouster has not been amenable to a repeat democracy experiment. The
Brookings Institution's **[Shadi Hamid observed that the 2013 massacre
of supporters of deposed President Morsi signaled the end of the "Arab
Spring" itself.]{.underline}**\[vii\] Rather than bow to American
pressure on an issue core to his domestic concerns, President **[Sisi
chose to lessen his dependence on Washington by inking
multibillion-dollar arms contracts with American arms competitors.
Diversifying arms suppliers is a financially expensive endeavor and can
lead to interoperability issues within a military and between partner
militaries. But politically, it allows flexibility and preserves a
measure of independence]{.underline}** from any one supplier in
particular. Furthermore, **[American national security interests
prevented Washington from more aggressively pressuring
Cairo]{.underline}**. The 2013 hold on arms sales noticeably exempted
the supply of spare parts and support. **[Completely cutting off
military assistance to Egypt was out of the question, however, as doing
so would result in both short-term damage to the Egyptian military and
long-term damage to U.S.-Egyptian relations.]{.underline}** In the short
term, **[Egypt's military readiness would take a hit. Egypt is engaged
in a counterinsurgency effort against Islamic State-linked militants in
the Sinai]{.underline}** and these operations would be negatively
impacted were Egypt unable to continue receiving support for its
American-supplied equipment. **[With quiet cooperation from Israel,
Egypt has made use of heavy equipment in the Sinai, such as
American-supplied F-16s and Apache helicopters]{.underline}**,\[viii\]
to combat militant groups. Over the longer term, as a direct consequence
of meddling in Egyptian military readiness, **[the U.S. would have been
perceived at best as an untrustworthy supplier and poor security
partner]{.underline}**, cementing an Egyptian shift to partners
perceived to be more reliable. **[Washington's ability to influence
Egypt on humanitarian matters,]{.underline}** always tenuous, **[would
further erode]{.underline}**.

Middle East: A Tragedy of Good Intentions,"

The Results of Aid to Egypt **[From the start, the U.S. has gotten it
wrong. Financial incentives have proved insufficient to compel the
Egyptian government to run against]{.underline}** the grain of
**[Egypt's anti-Western]{.underline}** domestic
**[identity]{.underline}** and geopolitical outlook. It is true that
Egypt has not made war since Israel gave up the entire Sinai Peninsula
following the Camp David Accords. But neither has Egypt been a friendly
or pro-American force in Arab politics and in the Middle East. For one
thing, **[Egypt's peace with Israel has been not only cold, but
downright hostile]{.underline}**. For instance, **[the Egyptian
government allows and at times encourages virulent anti- American,
anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic propaganda in the nation's government
controlled press.]{.underline}** The government daily paper Al-Akbar
stated in an April, 2000 editorial that "Jews should not be trusted
because they are a nation of vagabonds filled with hatred toward the
entire world."17 One writer in Egypt's most highly regarded newspaper,
the government- affiliated Al-Aharam, asked rhetorically: "What benefit
will they \[the Jews\] derive from the dominion they have achieved in
this world, once they leave it? How will they benefit from their riches
when they reach absolute poverty \[in Hell\]? Who will rescue them?
There is no America there, and if America were there, it would not be
able to help them; rather, it would share their fate, which it also
deserves."18 The government-affiliated Al- Gumhuriya daily published an
article which argued: Zionist propaganda continues, even today, to raise
the issue of the Nazi crematoriums for Jews, although the historical
evidence, revealed by renowned German, British, and French historians,
proved that claims that such crematoriums existed in the Nazi detention
camps are jokes\.... They were invented and used by the Zionist
movement\...to terrify the European countries during WWII so that the
Jews would flee from Europe to Palestine, because the Zionist movement
realized that the Jews ignored its call to immigrate to Palestine.19 The
most popular Egyptian film of the past few years described the story of
a man who has discovered an Israeli plot to poison Egypt's drinking
water, and who sets out to turn the plot against the Israelis
themselves. The film ends with a scene depicting Hassidic Jews in full
garb keeling over as they drink their poisoned water. The bounds of good
taste prevent me from reviewing many other examples of the rhetoric of
the government controlled (and often state-sponsored) Egyptian media.
Along with this sort of incitement and propaganda, the **[Egyptians have
also taken direct action to prevent the peace with Israel from reaching
the depth envisioned by its framers.]{.underline}** Indeed, **[Egypt has
often been at the head of Arab diplomatic attacks against the Israelis
--]{.underline}** and **[at one point]{.underline}** in 1995 it even
**[proposed a resolution to the Arab League to reinstate the economic
embargo against Israel]{.underline}**.20 Asked about this "cold peace"
by Barry Satloff of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy,
Egyptian President Mubarak said: "Believe me, it will stay cold and it
will stay cold for a very long time to come."21 More seriously, **[Egypt
has also engaged in diplomatic maneuvers quite directly opposed to
American interests in the region]{.underline}**. **[It
has]{.underline}** for instance **[opposed American
efforts,]{.underline}** including ones with Jordanian support, **[to
unseat Saddam Hussein in Iraq]{.underline}**.22 **[Egypt has also
opposed nearly all UN resolutions aimed at eliminating Iraqi weapons of
mass destruction]{.underline}**.23 Egypt even supported a failed effort
by the UAE to lift the UN sanctions on Iraq. As recently as August of
2000, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said that "the issue of Iraq
has to be revisited\...maintaining these sanctions is unacceptable to
the Arab world."24 It is, of course, impossible to say whether these
American efforts would have met with more success were it not for
Egyptian interference, but the interference certainly demonstrates
Egypt's willingness to stand firmly in the way of American policy. The
**[Egyptians have also sabotaged the Arab-Israeli peace
process]{.underline}**. **[Egypt did not take kindly to Israel's peace
treaty with Jordan,]{.underline}** certainly the most beneficial and
least troublesome element of the peace process. In a speech to the
Second Middle East Economic Summit in 1995, Egyptian Foreign Minister
Moussa interrupted and insulted Jordan's King Hussein saying: "Your
majesty\...our interaction with Israel must be undertaken with the
greatest reason, confidence and wisdom, not by showing off or rushing
in" -- implying that the king was a reckless show off.25 Again and
again, the **[Egyptians took steps behind the scenes to make Hussein's
efforts to normalize relations with Israel more
difficult.]{.underline}** Th**[e Egyptians also registered strong
opposition to the Turkish-Israeli Military Accord of 1996, and in its
wake implicitly threatened that they might form an alliance with Syria
in response]{.underline}** -- thus **[suggesting]{.underline}**, in the
words of one analyst, **[that "rather than]{.underline}** champion or at
least **[support a pro-Western alliance, Cairo would apparently prefer
closer ties with a nation that is on the State Department's list of
supporters of terrorism."]{.underline}**26 Another useful measure of
Egypt's behavior as a client state and recipient of American aid is its
willingness to back the United States in international forums. Here,
too, we find that Egypt often stands in opposition to American wishes
and interests. **[At the United Nations in the past several years, Egypt
has cast its ballot against the United States 61 percent of the
time]{.underline}**.27 The **[Egyptians have also openly opposed and
violated the American embargo against Libya,]{.underline}** **[and have
opened the way for military, economic and political relations with the
Kadhafi regime]{.underline}**. In 1997, Republican Senator Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky stated on the Senate floor that these improving
relations reflected "Egypt's shift from a partner in peace to an
advocate for a terrorist state armed with chemical weapons - a
capability which represents a direct threat to U.S. interests."28
McConnell even proposed cutting American aid in response, but the
Clinton Administration blocked his attempt to do so. **[Even more
alarming than this is Egypt's relationship with North Korea in the
development of missile technology, in direct violation of U.S. laws
governing foreign aid]{.underline}**. A CIA report to Congress in 1999
stated that: "During the first half of 1998, **[Egypt continued to
obtain ballistic-missile components and associated equipment from North
Korea.]{.underline}** This activity is **[part of a long-running program
of ballistic missile cooperation between these two
countries."]{.underline}**29 An Air Force National Intelligence Center
report from October of 1999 states plainly that Cairo "is secretly
cooperating with Pyongyang in building Scud missiles."30 These reports
do not state the obvious: **[Egypt's cooperation consists mostly of
money it pays to North Korea -- money that Egypt can spend only because
the U.S. itself provides the Egyptians with funds.]{.underline}** North
Korea is designated a "terrorist state" under section 620A of the
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.31 That same law states plainly: "The
President shall withhold assistance under this act to the government of
any country that provides assistance to the government of any other
country for which the secretary of state has made determination under
section 620A."32 A later law also prohibits "the sale or license of
export of defense articles or defense services to any country determined
by the president, in a fiscal year, to be not cooperating with U.S.
Anti-Terrorism efforts."33 In other words, U.S. law clearly requires the
United States to withhold all economic and military aid from Egypt, and
even to stop exporting military equipment to Egypt. Hence aid to Egypt
is not only ineffective, but literally illegal. And yet it continues,
because of the insupportable (but unexamined) premise that the U.S. is
helping itself by helping Egypt. In sum, U.**[S. aid to Egypt is
remarkably powerless against Egyptian misbehavior in part because it
involves only carrots, and no stick]{.underline}**. As Barry Satloff of
the Washington Institute for Near East Policy has put it: "While
important and fundamental areas of U.S.- Egyptian cooperation remain
intact, I fear that they reflect only an episodic convergence of
interests, not a pattern of partnership"34 Aid is not changing that.
Alas, **[aid has brought about the sort of convergence of interests
between U.S. and Egyptian officials that is injurious to the United
States]{.underline}**. The **[enormous amounts of money
involved]{.underline}** inevitably **[created interests inside the U.S.
bureaucracy as well as in the body politic, whose prestige and
pocketbooks profit from continued aid.]{.underline}** Hence their
**[support for Egypt has less to do with any affection for Egypt or for
U.S. foreign policy than with a tacit bargain: American officials help
Egyptian officials to get rich, and Egyptian officials help their
American counterparts to validate their reputations.]{.underline}** U.S.
strategy in the region has come to rely on an intricately constructed
and well- financed chimera: permanent comprehensive regional peace. This
goal requires the suspension of all the normal rules of international
politics and diplomacy. Money is the means by which the United States
entices the Arab states to play along. Without aid to Egypt, the
Egyptians might stray from the U.S. line far more clamorously than they
have, and the entire structure of the policy would collapse. Hence
American policymakers have committed the nation to continued support of
a country they know acts in direct defiance of American interests while
using American taxpayers' money to induce Egyptian officials to help
them convince those taxpayers that they are themselves doing a good job.
Egypt is the most prominent and extreme example of this problem, but the
problem applies to all of America's Arab partners in the peace process.
In order to support the inherently incredible script of the peace
process, the U.S. has had to create a fictional political reality, and
the only way to do this is to continue funneling money to the actors.
The promise of aid brings the participants to the table, and the power
of aid keeps them from openly defying the script, but just beneath the
surface, as we have just seen with Egypt, the realities of politics have
not disappeared, and the nations involved act in ways which harm U.S.
interests and certainly contradict the vision of comprehensive peace.
**[American policy and]{.underline}** American
**[interests]{.underline}** thus **[come increasingly into conflict with
one another, and aid is a principal cause of this]{.underline}** growing
contradiction. Finally, **[aid is]{.underline}** positively **[harmful
because it keeps this contradiction hidden from American eyes and makes
the United States a victim of its own generosity.]{.underline}**

#### Conditioning fails -- multiple warrants

Seth **Binder** 3/28/**18** \[Lobe Log, "Time To Rethink U.S. Military
Aid To Egypt"\] \[DS\]
\[https://lobelog.com/time-to-rethink-u-s-military-aid-to-egypt/\]

Conditioning Aid The U.S. government once considered military aid to
Egypt as sacrosanct, but the funding has received more scrutiny
recently. The Trump administration continues to request the traditional
\$1.3 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) per year, but so far
it has upheld the Obama administration's restructuring of the aid. This
includes maintaining the elimination of cash-flow financing, **[a
credit-card approach where Egypt could use expected future aid to
acquire military equipment.]{.underline}** The Trump administration also
reprogrammed \$65.7 million in FMF and **[withheld an additional \$195
million following the State Department's inability to certify the
required congressional condition that Egypt was making progress on
democracy and human rights]{.underline}**. **[Instead of reprogramming
the \$195 million, the administration took the odd step of using its
national-security waiver to allow the release of the funds to Egypt at a
later date.]{.underline}** Congress has continued to condition U.S.
military aid on a variety of concerns including democracy and human
rights, but **[the national-security waiver has often allowed aid to
flow with minimal repercussions for Egypt.]{.underline}** In the most
dramatic move in recent memory, the Senate appropriations committee
sought to cut the FMF aid by \$300 million, but that effort has stalled
in continuing resolutions. Ultimately, the lasting impact of decades of
providing over \$1 billion in military aid to Egypt per year is not just
the massive number of tanks and missiles, but the military's influence
over the Egyptian state. For example, the military's role in the economy
is thought to be somewhere between 40 and 60 percent and includes
businesses involved in nearly every sector, from foodstuffs and real
estate to construction and electronics. U.S. military aid is not cash
that can be diverted for personal benefit. **[But agreements that allow
for U.S. aid to be spent on economic activities within Egypt, like
co-production of the M-1 Abrams tank, have helped perpetuate
military-run businesses that lack transparency and
oversight.]{.underline}**

**[The pattern over the last five years has been consistent: The U.S.
withholds military aid from Egypt, citing human rights concerns, only to
eventually release the funds before any substantial improvement. The
first time was under President Obama's administration in 2013. The
United States suspended aid after Egypt's first elected president,
Mohamed Morsi, was ousted. Two years later, Obama restored the annual
\$1.3 billion in military financing,]{.underline}** citing the need to
help Egypt defeat Islamic State militants in the Sinai province**[. It
happened again most recently under President Trump. After growing
concern of repression under Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Sisi's
government, the Trump administration froze \$195 million in military
assistance to Cairo, only to release it at the end of July --- 11 months
later --- despite the Egyptian government not meeting U.S.
conditions]{.underline}**. The failure of two administrations to sustain
pressure on Sisi's government despite worsening repression on civil
society suggests that American national security interests supersede
human rights concerns, experts said. "**[The U.S. cares more about
security than human rights]{.underline}**," said Steven Cook, a senior
fellow for the Middle East at the Council on Foreign Relations. "I**[t
also implies that suspending aid hasn't really done anything to improve
Egypt's human rights situation.]{.underline}**" Since the late 1970s,
the U.S. has viewed Egypt as an important and powerful ally in the
Middle East. Part of maintaining that good-faith relationship has been
to provide Egypt with military aid. **[Egypt is the second-largest
recipient of foreign military funding after Israel]{.underline}**.
**[Every year the U.S. provides Egypt with \$1.3 billion in military
assistance that it uses to buy equipment and conduct
training]{.underline}**. **[A year ago, then-Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson froze 15%, or \$195 million, of the total annual military aid
and conditioned its release on three point]{.underline}**s: Egypt must
downgrade relations with North Korea, repeal a law that restricts the
work of nongovernmental organizations and resolve the case of 43 NGO
workers who were convicted in 2013 of working illegally. Egypt and North
Korea have had friendly diplomatic and military relations for some time,
including weapons purchases from each other. A small number of the NGO
workers left the country after they were convicted but still face jail
sentences if they return to Egypt. Egypt's top appeal court ordered
retrials for 16 people in April, but the outcome remains to be seen. The
workers were employed by various unregistered NGOs, including U.S. and
German organizations. Less than a year after freezing the military aid,
on July 25, Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo lifted the restrictions
without specifying what progress, if any, has been made. **[Releasing
military assistance to Egypt without seeing improvements in human rights
taints the perception that the U.S. is serious in holding Egypt
accountable]{.underline}**, said Andrew Miller, deputy director for
policy at the Project on Middle East Democracy. "Releasing the money
removes pressure on the Egyptian government to meet conditions that were
originally attached to that funding," Miller said. "Egyptians will look
back and see that this is further evidence Americans aren't serious
about human rights concerns. It hurts the idea of using assistance to
leverage influence." The other time the U.S. froze military aid to Egypt
was in 2013 over the bloody crackdown and repression of supporters of
Morsi, who was affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood. He was ousted by
the military after massive demonstrations by Egyptians concerned that
Morsi was taking the country in an Islamist direction and failing to
solve its many problems. The Obama administration released that military
aid in 2015 to help Egypt fight Islamic State militants who had
established a toehold in the Sinai. Since then the human rights
situation in Egypt has worsened. Egyptian officials continue to lock up
young activists who speak out against the government as tens of
thousands of political prisoners sit in jail. "U.S. policymakers look at
Sisi and say he may be a dictator but at least he's taking care of
Islamic State in the Sinai. They are willing to overlook human rights
violation to maintain security," said Amr Kotb, advocacy director at the
Washington-based Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy. "The U.S.
views human rights and national security as mutually exclusive." The
next time the U.S. decides to withhold funds, it will have less impact,
rights advocates and experts warn. "The administration fails to
understand that the status of human rights in Egypt has a direct impact
on U.S. national security interests, including counter-terrorism,"
Miller said. Miller said there have been examples in which withholding
aid has been effective in the short term, such as pressuring Egypt to
release detained Egyptian Americans. "Military assistance holds are like
sanctions in that you're denying something with the hope that it changes
behavior," Miller said. "It's not instantaneous. Obama and Trump have
backed down from assistance holds and lifted them before they could have
an effect," he said. "It reduces incentives from Egypt. They don't
believe our stance, and it prevents more significant change."

CAIRO --- Egypt's jail population has swelled. New prisoners include a
Lebanese tourist who complained about Egypt on Facebook; a democracy
activist who spoke out about sexual harassment; and a visiting grad
student from an American university who was arrested as he researched
the judiciary. In Sinai, human rights activists say the army has
demolished the houses of 3,000 families as part of operations against
the Islamic State. The State Department's take on Egypt's human rights
progress? A thumbs up. This week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo lifted
restrictions on \$195 million in military aid that was frozen last year
to protest Egypt's dire human rights record and its relationship with
North Korea, a State Department official said. **[The aid had been
reinstated in response to steps taken by Egypt on specific U.S.
concerns, the official said, without specifying what they were. Human
rights groups slammed Mr. Pompeo's decision, saying he had squandered
valuable leverage over President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi at a time when his
human rights record seems to be only getting worse]{.underline}**.
"Repression is breeding resentment, and in some cases radicalization,"
said Brian Dooley of Human Rights First, an American advocacy group.
"**[That will ultimately further destabilize Egypt and undermine
American interests."]{.underline}** American officials say they withheld
the \$195 million in aid to press Egypt over a narrow set of issues.
**[The Trump administration wants Mr. Sisi to overturn the 2013
conviction of 43 employees of international groups that promote
democracy, including 17 American citizens.]{.underline}** And it wants
Mr. Sisi to rescind a draconian law regulating aid agencies that he
signed last year, which could make it virtually impossible for many
international aid groups to work in Egypt. But those demands were made
in private, and experts said it was unclear how much the Egyptians had
conceded. **[It seems probable that Mr. Sisi will seize on the
resumption of aid as a validation of his actions so far, and perhaps
will feel emboldened to step up his repression. "It's highly debatable
whether Egypt has fully met any one of those conditions]{.underline}**,"
said Andrew Miller of the Project on Middle East Democracy. "But the
Egyptians will present this decision as an American blessing of their
policies." The aid decision reflects the new tenor of American foreign
policy under Mr. Pompeo and the national security adviser, John R.
Bolton, who have shown a willingness to trade American leadership on
human rights for an embrace of friendly autocrats like Mr. Sisi who
share their hostility toward political Islam. Mr. Sisi has long enjoyed
a warm relationship with President Trump, who hailed the Egyptian leader
as a "fantastic guy" and even publicly complimented his taste in shoes.
But the Egyptian leader had a tougher time from the previous secretary
of state, Rex W. Tillerson, who last August denied Egypt \$96 million in
aid and suspended \$195 million. **[Egyptian officials were shocked at
the rebuke from the United States, which over the past 40 years has
given Egypt \$47 billion in military aid and \$24 billion in economic
assistance.]{.underline}** Mr. Tillerson was said to be angry that Mr.
Sisi had broken a private promise, made in Washington, that he would not
sign the harsh law on aid agency regulations. In May 2017, Mr. Sisi went
ahead and enacted the law anyway. Mr. Tillerson also sought to press
Egypt over its relationship with North Korea, which operates a large
embassy in Cairo that it uses to carry out illicit arms sales across the
Middle East, according to United Nations inspectors. Mr. Sisi's
government has partly addressed some American concerns. A retrial of the
case involving the 43 foreign aid workers, many of whom were convicted
in absentia, is scheduled to start this year. Egyptian media reports say
that Mr. Sisi has forced North Korea to cut the number of diplomats
stationed at its embassy in Cairo. But such restrictions can be easily
circumvented through the use of accounting measures, like counting
diplomats as spouses, said Mr. Miller, the analyst, who worked on Egypt
at the State Department until last year. "If past is prologue, we will
see that as soon as the U.S. looks the other way, the Egyptians will
start up their relationship with North Korea again," he said. On most
other fronts, things have gotten markedly worse in Egypt. Since Mr.
Sisi's re-election in May, after a carefully managed vote, the president
has redoubled his efforts to lock up even relatively mild critics.

On January 27, **[President]{.underline}** Emmanuel **[Macron
began]{.underline}** his **[first official visit to Egypt. Relations
between the two countries]{.underline}** and presidents **[have never
been warmer. Macron has justified France's support for Egypt, despite
the well documented human rights abuses by President]{.underline}**
Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's government, **[by saying that France considers
Egypt a bulwark against terrorism.]{.underline}** Macron has gone as far
as to
[say](https://www.lepoint.fr/societe/macron-ne-veut-pas-donner-de-lecons-sur-les-droits-de-l-homme-a-sissi-24-10-2017-2166995_23.php)
that "Egypt's security is France's security." In the name of this
friendship, **[France has sold many weapons to Egypt, overtaking the US
to become Egypt's main arms supplier [between 2013 and
2017](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2018-03/fssipri_at2017_0.pdf).
In 2017 alone, it delivered more than EUR 1.4 billion worth of military
and security equipment. France has provided warships, fighter jets, and
armored vehicles,]{.underline}** while French companies -- with the
government's approval - have provided **[surveillance and crowd control
tools]{.underline}**. [Last December in
Cairo](https://www.challenges.fr/monde/sissi-et-parly-inaugurent-le-1e-salon-de-l-armement-egyptien_629699),
French Defense Minister Florence Parly cut the ribbon with al-Sisi for
Egypt's first arms show. **[When Macron has been criticized for his
support]{.underline}** for al-Sisi, **[[his
answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x84JszbyWc) has been that he
wants to be pragmatic and "does not want to lecture" al-Sisi on human
rights]{.underline}**. But the issue here is not about France lecturing
Egypt or a case of naïve activists unaware of the security risks in
Egypt. The issue is about **[France directly enabling abuses and not
respecting its own international obligations regulating arms sales,
which prohibit arms transfers to countries where there is a substantial
risk that they could be used to commit or facilitate serious
violations]{.underline}**. The **[French authorities contend that they
have only licensed military equipment as part of the "fight against
terrorism"]{.underline}** in Egypt and not for law enforcement
operations. But as recent reports by Amnesty International and FIDH have
demonstrated, **[French-supplied armored vehicles were used by Egyptian
security forces to violently disperse peaceful sit-ins across the
country]{.underline}**. Amnesty International noted, "**[French vehicles
were]{.underline}** not merely assisting the security forces, but were
**[themselves tools of repression, playing a very active role in the
crushing of dissent."]{.underline}** In response to the criticism, the
**[French government argues that such exports were intended for the
Egyptian military, not the police. But France should have monitored the
use of weapons and equipment it exported, and there is no evidence that
France put a stop to the weapons transfers]{.underline}** once it became
clear that Egypt had diverted their use. In addition to its direct
support for the military and police, the **[French government has
authorized French companies to sell Egyptian authorities various
surveillance systems for [intercepting
communications](https://www.fidh.org/en/issues/litigation/egypt-a-repression-made-in-france)
and controlling social movements]{.underline}**. The **[Egyptian state's
ever-expanding surveillance has been used to target human rights and
labor activists, LGBT people, political activists, and
academics.]{.underline}** Al-Sisi's fear of social movements is so deep
that in December his government even banned the sale of yellow vests in
fear of copycat protests in advance of the anniversary of the 2011
uprising. Even France's claims that al-Sisi is essential to the fight
against terrorism looks shaky on closer inspection. **[Egypt is indeed
facing a dangerous insurgency by extremist fighters]{.underline}** in
the northern Sinai Peninsula, a historically marginalized territory. But
**[the way the Egyptian security forces have countered this insurgency
has been a textbook case of abuses that have not just violated human
rights but alienated large segments of the local population that these
actions are supposed to protect.]{.underline}** Egyptian forces carried
out unlawful mass destruction of homes and forcible evictions of tens of
thousands of residents in northern Sinai with [little or no help or
temporary
accommodation](https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/09/22/egypt-thousands-evicted-sinai-demolitions)
for the people forced out of their homes. Human Rights Watch's research
shows that the Egyptian military and police have carried out widespread
arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial
killings, in northern Sinai while attempting to conceal these abuses
through restrictions on independent reporting. Residents of the area
told us that they no longer knew whom to trust. France is happy to
whitewash these abuses in the name of the fight against terrorism. In
other parts of Egypt, the situation is not much better. Torture and
enforced disappearances occur regularly, and overcrowded prisons with
brutal detention conditions are becoming breeding grounds for
radicalization, former inmates say. Meanwhile, Egyptian authorities have
used the cover of counterterrorism to go after all forms of dissent.
Egypt has not only banned the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist
organization, but also secular groups like the April 6 Youth Movement,
an activist group that played a key role in the protests organized
against Hosni Mubarak in 2011. A March 2018
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoC4rglTwyM) by the Interior
Ministry portrays a threat to Egypt's security emanating from groups
ranging from ISIS to human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch.
**[By offering unconditional and uncritical support, France has made it
harder to get Egypt to revisit its current approach.]{.underline}**
Despite the government's massive military efforts, northern Sinai
residents hardly feel more secure. Many displaced by the violence in
past years have reported losing hope of going back home. According to
data compiled by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project
(ACLED), the number of armed violent events in Egypt nearly doubled
between November and December 2018 due to the escalation of the fighting
between Egyptian forces and the Islamic State. According to ACLED, Egypt
became the third-most-active country in terms of violence on the African
continent in December, after Somalia and Nigeria. .

[Egypt was the world's third largest arms importer in

Friday March 15. Pieter D. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI
Arms and Military Expenditure program, declared that [Russia, France and
Germany intensely increased their arms sales to Egypt over the past five
years]{.underline}. Alongside Saudi Arabia, India and Australia**[,
Egypt ranked amidst the world largest arm importers.]{.underline}** The
report showed that Saudi Arabia was the world's largest arms importer in
2014--18, citing a noticeable [increase of 192%]{.underline} compared to
2009--13. Imports by Israel (354%), Qatar (225%) and Iraq (139%) also
rose from 2009-13 to 2014-18. He added that the Gulf region, in which
conflicts and tensions are dramatically concentrated, are in high demand
for weapons from the USA, the United Kingdom and France. Remarkably,
Middle Eastern countries increased their arms imports by 87% between
2009--13 and 2014--18 and accounted for 35% of global arms imports in
2014--18, doubling their imports during the past five years, the report
said. The report highlighted the increasing arms flow from 2009--13 to
2014--18 by exporters to the Middle East specifically. The SPRI reported
the [five largest exporters in 2014-18 as the United States, Russia,
France, Germany and China, accounting for 75% of the total volume of

the USA exported arms to at least 98 countries during the past five

### 1NC France -- Non U/Q

#### French arms sales are decreasing -- oil and electoral uncertainty

**Tran 18** (Pierre, 7-5-2018, \"Why have French arms exports dropped 50
percent from 2016 to 2017?,\" Defense News,
<https://www.defensenews.com/industry/2018/07/05/why-have-french-arms-exports-dropped-50-percent-since-last-year/>,
brt)

**[Electoral uncertainty and hard times for oil producers led to a
halving of French arms exports]{.underline}** last year, the annual
government report to parliament showed July 4. Fr**[ance won in 2017
orders for arms exports worth €6.9 billion]{.underline}** (U.S. \$8
billion), half the €14 billion booked in the previous year, the report
on foreign weapon sales said. **[That sharp drop in foreign weapon sales
reflected "greater constraints]{.underline}**" in 2017, notably nations
waiting to see the outcome of the French elections and an economic
slowdown among most oil producers, the report said. The latter led many
hydrocarbon-rich countries to postpone some arms deals. The big drop in
2017 followed two buoyant years due to export contracts for the Dassault
Rafale fighter jet, with 2015 hitting a record high of €16.9 billion.
**[France sold some major arms packages last year]{.underline}**, but
those contracts will not go into effect until 2018, including Qatar
exercising an option for a further 12 Rafale fighters, the report said.
Qatar previously took some eight months to raise a commercial bank loan
to pay a 15 percent down payment for its 2015 order for 24 Rafale
fighters and missiles worth €6.3 billion. The total of last year's deals
match the average value booked in previous years before the spike in
2015 and 2016, the report said. **[Sales in the Middle East accounted
for just over 60 percent]{.underline}** of the total value last year,
**[reflecting close French ties to the region]{.underline}** and "the
struggle of several nations against terrorism," the report said. The
Asia-Pacific region accounted for some 17 percent of sales, followed by
Europe and "the American continent." "This export strategy, in close
ties with foreign policy, defense and security of France, is conducted
with the strict respect of French commitment to international
agreements, and governed by a very strict control of exports," the
report said. Helicopters and missiles, with a strong naval focus for the
latter, accounted for more than half the amount recorded last year. Most
of the contracts were worth less than €200 million, a market segment
which is fairly stable despite stiff competition, particularly from
emerging export nations offering "low-cost" deals, the report said.
Sales in that segment accounted for €4.1 billion of the total annual
amount. Besides access to Western technology, "a French solution
presents a real autonomy in use," the report said. Key elements in
winning contracts are the transfer of technology and offset deals with
local industrial partners, the report said. The sale of submarines to
Australia and Rafale to India are major examples. **[A sustained export
drive has led to an "internationalization," with French companies
setting up subsidiaries and seeking local partners abroad, not just a
simple sales drive,]{.underline}** said Hélène Masson, senior research
fellow at the think tank Fondation pour la Recherche Stratégique.
"**[The [French defense technological and industrial
base](https://www.fifthdomain.com/industry/2018/07/02/french-firm-makes-moves-to-fund-cybersecurity-expansion/) seeks
exports to compensate for a drop in]{.underline}** French and European
**[orders]{.underline}**, accelerating after 2010," she said. **[That
has led to a structural shift in companies' internal organization,
international presence and product portfolio]{.underline}**.
**[Companies' relations with suppliers and industrial partnerships have
also changed]{.underline}**. **[Client nations calling for local
investment through direct offset deals is the key factor, speeding the
transformation, she said. French intermediate, medium and small
enterprises must deal with complex financial, legal and commercial
issues.]{.underline}**

**[France is working to reduce US-made components from its defense
products so as not to run afoul of the US International Traffic in Arms
Regulations (ITAR) which allow Washington to veto sale to countries it
does not approve of]{.underline}**. **[French Defence Minister Florence
Parly said Yesterday that reducing dependence on US-made components was
necessary so as not to hinder the export of French military
products]{.underline}**. France has had to time and again seek US
permission to export products even if a very small component by value or
importance was included in the French system. Florence Parly said, \"We
need to gradually de-sensitize ourselves in relation to a certain number
of American components, which does not necessarily mean being able to
de-sensitize completely,\" she explained during a meeting with the
Association of Professional Journalists (Aeronautics and Space) in
comments widely quoted in the French media. She said that France has
launched a plan to reduce dependence on certain American components;
\"We have encountered difficulties related to export prospects, and we
know that these difficulties are apparently linked to strategic
questions and in reality often due to problems of commercial
competition,\" she explained. Under US ITAR regulations, if a
foreign-made arms system contains even one US component, the United
States has the power to prohibit its export to a third country. Recently
the US blocked the sale of the French-made Scalp cruise missile which
was to arm the Rafale fighter jet, meant for export to Egypt and Qatar.
In 2013, Washington had refused a request for re-export from France to
the United Arab Emirates of \"Made in USA\" components needed to
manufacture two French spy satellites by Airbus and Thales. **[François
Hollande\'s visit to the United States in February 2014 had positively
resolved this issue]{.underline}**. During her hearing last July in the
National Assembly, Florence Parly had acknowledged that \"we are at the
mercy of the Americans when our materials are concerned. Do we have the
means to be completely independent of the American components, I do not
think so**[, are we trying to improve the situation, the answer is
yes."]{.underline}** Florence Parly argued that **[this lower dependence
(on the US) would be crucial for the viability of the future combat
aircraft program. It goes for Paris and Berlin to have the capacity to
export this future weapon system. It considered that manufacturers
should take this issue into account by launching investments in research
and technology to be able to manufacture a similar component that would
escape the ITAR scrutiny. \"Some manufacturers have
understoo]{.underline}**d,\" she said. Meanwhile, **[European missile
manufacturer MBDA has already started the process of making its products
ITAR-free]{.underline}**. **[Its future air-to-air missile MICA-NG which
will be operational in 2025, will be free of ITAR-restricted
components,]{.underline}** La Tribune reported.

\[http://en.c4defence.com/Agenda/france-to-remove-us-components-from-scalp/6827/1\]

**[France is seeking to reduce its reliance on U.S. approval for French
arms exports]{.underline}**. **[France has therefore decided to remove
an American component from the SCALP cruise missile so that it can
proceed with a new sale of Rafale fighters to Egypt.]{.underline}**
Answering questions on weapons exports in the country's National
Assembly, French Defence Minister Florence Parly said that **[the
decision by the United States to use the International Trade in Arms
Regulation (ITAR) agreement to block the sale of the air-launched
land-attack cruise missile to Egypt could be circumvented if
domestically-built parts are used instead]{.underline}**, but that this
would take time. Parly said, "It is true that we depend on this (U.S.
International Traffic in Arms Regulations) mechanism: We are at the
mercy of the Americans when our equipment is concerned". "What is the
solution? That the manufacturer of these missiles, namely **[MBDA, make
the investment in research and technology to be able to make a similar
component, which would avoid ITAR]{.underline}**,\" she added.\"
**[Egypt could still receive MBDA SCALP cruise missiles from France, if
it is willing to accept a delay while US-manufactured components are
replaced with French ones]{.underline}**. As noted by Parly in her
response, the issue of the ITAR regulation is not just affecting the
sale of the SCALP missile to Egypt, but also of the Dassault Rafale that
will carry it. Cairo is looking to add to the 24 aircraft it has already
procured from Paris with 12 more, with these additional platforms being
equipped with the SCALP missile. According to reports, **[the Egyptian
government will not sign for the new aircraft unless the missiles are
included]{.underline}**.

In his five years in office, **[Egyptian]{.underline}**
**[President]{.underline}** Abdel Fattah **[el-Sisi has been able to
count on France as a trustworthy arms supplier during one of the most
troubled periods in his country's history. A report published by several
NGOs]{.underline}** - including the International Federation for Human
Rights (FIDH), the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, the League
of Human Rights and the Observatory of Weaponry (OBSARM) -- on Monday
**[claimed that "the French state]{.underline}** and several French
companies **[have participated in the bloody Egyptian repression of the
last five years". The relationship between French]{.underline}** arms
**[manufacturers and the Egyptian]{.underline}** **[state]{.underline}**
under Sisi **[began soon after the former defence minister took power on
3 July, 2013. On]{.underline}** **[12 August that year]{.underline}** -
**[two days before the Egyptian army's crackdown on protesters
i]{.underline}**n Rabaa al-Adawiya Square, during which more than 800
people were killed - **[French company Manurhin]{.underline}**, a
leading manufacturer of ammunition-producing machinery, **[was due to
deliver a machine]{.underline}** to manufacture 20mm and 40mm
cartridges, **[which can be used for]{.underline}** both rubber-coated
steel **[bullets]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[tear gas
canisters]{.underline}**, to the Egyptian government. However, **[just
before the state-of-the-art equipment was due to be delivered, French
customs blocked the transfer, following the escalation of demonstrations
sparked by the coup]{.underline}** against President Mohamed Morsi.
**[French and European arms exports to Egypt were suspended for a few
months, only to start anew after Sisi took office, with considerable
attention paid to a large-scale project meant to modernise the Egyptian
army]{.underline}** - with the support of substantial Saudi funding.
**[The Egyptian army purchased German]{.underline}** U214
**[submarines]{.underline}**, **[Russian]{.underline}** Mig-29
**[fighter jets and]{.underline}** S-350 **[anti-aircraft missiles, but
French weapons manufacturers' sales also boomed at the
time,]{.underline}** with the orders of Rafale fighter jets, a FREMM
frigate, three Gowind corvettes, and hundreds of armoured vehicles.
Sisi's Egypt even helped France after French company DCNS - now known as
Naval Group - found itself mired in a crisis with Moscow due to
sanctions that led to France's refusal to deliver two Mistral helicopter
carriers to the Russian navy. Egypt swooped in to claim the two huge
ships, worth more than a billion euros, effectively saving DCNS.
Moreover, **[French companies have also proven to be a great support in
providing systems to monitor Egyptians' daily lives.]{.underline}** In
their report, the **[NGOs said by "equipping the Egyptian security and
repression services with powerful digital tools, \[France]{.underline}**

France, to suspend their arms transfers to Egyp]{.underline}**t in order
to prevent them from being used for domestic repression purposes. But
paradoxically, **[France has never sold and delivered so many weapons to
Egypt in such a short time period as since 2011. The country became
France's fourth-largest customer between 2007 and 2016. Under the cover
of the war on terror, and in spite the EU's call to member states and
the 2008 EU Common Position defining rules regarding the control of
military technology and equipment exports, France has continued to
provide weapons]{.underline}** and devices that can be used for domestic
security and law-and-order purposes. According to the FIDH, **[at least
eight French companies, encouraged by]{.underline}** successive
**[government]{.underline}**s, took **[advantage of the situation in
Egypt to reap record profits. Between 2010 and 2016, French arms

on defense and civilian deals, and rights groups say the crackdown on
liberties has only worsened.]{.underline}** NGOs are piling pressure on
Macron to be firm in confronting the Egyptian president, who in April
secured a second term, shoring up his position as a powerbroker in the

### 1NC France -- Intervention Turn

CAIRO (AP) --- **[French President Emmanuel Macron aims to speak out
stronger than in the past about human rights issues while in Egypt,
where France seeks to reinforce strategic ties with a country he
considers a key regional partner,]{.underline}** he told reporters on
Sunday. **[Heading a large delegation on a three-day trip to the Arab
world\'s most populous country, Macron said he wants to \"pursue a
truthful dialogue on topics of public freedoms and human
rights]{.underline}**,\" **[an area he feels Egypt has not progressed
enough on since he raised it with officials earlier in his mandate.
France, which considers itself the birthplace of human rights, has come
under pressure by advocates to raise the issue with
general-turned-President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, whose human rights
record has been widely condemned and is seen as
worsening.]{.underline}** **[Macron said that too many people who
present no threat to the country were being jailed.]{.underline}** \"It
is on this area of what is happening in Egypt that I will **[continue to
focus things]{.underline}**. I will do it more openly during this
trip,\" he said, adding that he considered it in the interest of
el-Sissi and Egypt to respect human rights. Macron said he felt the
current crackdown on opposition in Egypt, begun after el-Sissi overthrew
his elected but divisive Islamist predecessor in 2013, had become worse
than under the country\'s longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak, who was
overthrown in the 2011 Arab Spring uprising. \"I think what is happening
here sooner or later **[threatens the stability of Egypt]{.underline}**.
That\'s to say, I think that the policies as they are being done are
perceived by intellectuals, the Egyptian civil society, as being even
stronger than (under) the Mubarak regime,\" he said. Macron said he
would raise specific names to el-Sissi in a confidential discussion.
Aside from heightened public emphasis on human rights, he did not
mention raising any new specific levers to try and incentivize el-Sissi.
**[Rights groups and activists have urged France and other Western
powers to halt weapons sales to Egypt, a major purchaser, until it shows
improvement on the way it treats its own citizenry. But Macron dismissed
using such pressure, saying it was]{.underline}** **[important to
respect Egypt\'s sovereignty and not cut it off because that could drive
it further into the arms of the West\'s authoritarian rivals, Russia and
China,]{.underline}** which el-Sissi has courted.

**[France's political elites accord particular value to sustaining a
strong international presence and influence for their country. France is
a world leader in the use of the principles of soft power, according to
a 2017 report by Portland Communications, a leading political
consultancy]{.underline}**. The UK, the US and **[Germany ranked second,
third and fourth, respectively, out of a list of 30 countries in this
report. Russia placed 26, despite its status as the second global and
nuclear power after the US. French culture is a central component of
France's soft power. The country possesses a vast international network
of French language-teaching organisations, and it is constantly
expanding and upgrading French schools and universities abroad, of which
there are 459 which enjoy excellent reputations as bastions for the
production of national elites. French perfume, fashion, beauty products
and jewellery are also among the visible trademarks of France's soft
power, and France has long stood in the vanguard of the power of ideas.
The French government has been proactive in developing its instruments
of soft power by adopting policies to promote the "economy of the
intangible" or "symbolic capital", with this being grounded in France's
rich artistic heritage as epitomised by the Louvre Museum in Paris and
the country's other famous museums and in its intellectual and
educational heritage as epitomised by the Sorbonne and other
universities. One example of the success of such policies can be found
in the Louvre Abu Dhabi Museum that French President Emmanuel Macron
inaugurated in 2017. In his speech on that occasion, Macron quoted from
the Russian writer Dostoyevsky's novel Crime and Punishment, in which
the main character, Raskolnikov, says that "beauty will save the world."
The museum cost \$525 million, footed by the UAE, in exchange for the
Louvre's name and 130 works of art on loan for 30 years. Art and
creativity thus became a new avenue for the realisation of economic
aims.]{.underline}**

**[France has experienced a meteoric rise to become a world leader in
soft power---topping the 2017 Soft Power 30 ranking. As defined by
Joseph Nye, soft power is the ability of a country to influence the
actions of others without force or coercion. France's influence is
perhaps most prominent in global health, which overlaps with
international security, economics, politics and human rights. Since
2000, France has played an active role in the development of key global
health initiatives and led multilateral efforts to provide
health-related assistance. France's funding for health-focused
development assistance increased threefold between 2002 and 2013. In
particular, France assumed a leadership role in global health
governance, worked to safeguard global health security through effective
responses to epidemics and elevated the threat posed by climate change
to a global health priority. Multilateral Leadership and Global Health
Governance France channels most of its funding for global health through
multilateral organizations, including the GAVI Alliance, World Health
Organization (WHO), Unitaid and the Global Fund. In May 2018, France
announced that it would host the sixth replenishment conference for the
Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) in
2019. The replenishment conference aims to raise new funds and mobilize
partners to eradicate the three diseases by 2030. Held once every three
years, the conference convenes leaders from governments, civil society,
the private sector and communities affected by the three most
devastating infectious diseases. According to the Global Fund, France is
its second-largest donor, having provided the organization with more
than €4.2 billion since 2002. Because no one country can protect the
health of its people on its own, the ability to bring various
stakeholders together and come to a consensus is a prerequisite for
mitigating health-related challenges and saving lives. As one of the
founding members of the organization, France has contributed
substantially to the design of the Global Fund in many ways. Today,
France continues to guide the work of the Global Fund through its
participation in the organization's board as well as its strategy and
audit and finance committees. Using its broad diplomatic network, France
helps more than 35 countries achieve the goals set out in their Global
Fund grants by serving as an active member of these countries' Country
Coordination Mechanism, a national committee that oversees the
submission of funding requests to the Global Fund as well as the
implementation of grants. Since 2011, France has allocated approximately
€18 million per year to the Global Fund to provide countries with
technical assistance through the "5% Initiative" for IDS, TB and
Malaria. In 2017, France increased the proportion of funds set aside for
technical assistance from five to seven percent.]{.underline}**

### 1NC France -- No Co-op

#### Alt cause to international cooperation -- domestic polarization

**Walt 18** (Stephen M. is the Robert and Renée Belfer professor of
international relations at Harvard University, 12-11-2018, \"America\'s
Polarization Is a Foreign Policy Problem, Too,\" Foreign Policy,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/11/americas-polarization-is-a-foreign-policy-problem-too/

That said, **[there's no question that the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[is at a level of [political
polarization](http://www.people-press.org/interactives/political-polarization-1994-2017/) unseen [for
many
decades](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-great-divide-polarization-in-american-politics/)]{.underline}**.
Most of the attention to this phenomenon has focused on its effects on
America's internal politics, and **[[some
observers](https://www.amazon.com/How-Democracies-Die-Steven-Levitsky/dp/1524762938) are
clearly worried that]{.underline}** the **[core
institutions]{.underline}** of the country **[might be at
risk]{.underline}**---understandable, **[given]{.underline}** President
Donald **[Trump's open hostility towards some of these]{.underline}**
institutions, **[his]{.underline}** apparent **[fondness for
authoritarians]{.underline}**, and the emergence of something resembling
"state media" (i.e., Fox News). **[Less attention has been
paid]{.underline}**, however, **[to the impact that hyperpolarization
could have]{.underline}** on U.S. foreign policy. Apart from
an [excellent
essay](https://twq.elliott.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs2121/f/downloads/TWQ_Winter%202018_Schultz.pdf) by
Ken Schultz of Stanford University, this topic just hasn't received a
lot of attention. But it should. How might excessive
polarization---**[where members of a society increasingly cluster into
separate "tribes" sharing political beliefs with each other, but not
with members of the opposing group---undermine foreign
policy?]{.underline}** Granting that a degree of disagreement is both
unavoidable and often desirable, how might such divisions get out of
hand and begin to damage America's ability to interact with the outside
world sensibly and successfully? We should begin by recognizing that
**[today's level of polarization may be]{.underline}** partly **[a
reflection of America's privileged international
position]{.underline}**. Once the Soviet Union collapsed and left the
United States at the pinnacle of power, the need for national unity
declined and ambitious politicians had less need to show restraint in
attacking their political rivals. As Michael Desch argued in a [seminal
article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2704078?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents),
**[states facing serious national-security challenges tend to be
stronger and more unified]{.underline}**, whereas those in a benign
international environment are prone to grow more fractious. America's
trajectory since 1992 fits Desch's argument quite well, notwithstanding
the brief surge of patriotic feeling that followed the 9/11 terrorist
attacks. To put it bluntly: Because the United States was now so safe
and secure, politicians felt they could sow division at home without
worrying too much about weakening the country abroad. Unfortunately,
**[one negative impact of excessive polarization is a decreased ability
to do the things that can keep the country on top]{.underline}** for a
long time. **[If polarization prevents the federal government from
taking effective action on climate change]{.underline}**, decaying
**[infrastructure, the opioid epidemic]{.underline}**, primary
**[education, financial regulation, the deficit, or any number of other
problems, America's long-term position of power could
erode]{.underline}** and leave the country less able to handle future
foreign-policy challenges. Morever, as Schultz notes, **[polarization
leaves the country more vulnerable to outside interference, as Russia's
efforts to interfere in the 2016 election illustrate.]{.underline}** We
still don't know exactly what Moscow did and what effects it ultimately
had, but it is clear that at a minimum, **[Russia sought to exploit and
exacerbate internal divisions that already existed]{.underline}**. And
this sort of thing can rapidly become self-reinforcing, as opposing
sides leap to accuse each other not just of bad judgment but of being
actively disloyal. This sort of thing is not unprecedented in U.S.
political history: In the early days of the republic, Hamiltonians
accused Thomas Jefferson of being overly sympathetic to revolutionary
France, while Jeffersonians believed Hamilton to be a closet monarchist
with a poorly disguised sympathy for Great Britain. It did not take much
for either group to see the other as more than misguided. Schultz also
points out that **[polarization threatens a nation's ability to reach
agreements with other countries.]{.underline}** It is no accident that
presidents have come to rely more and more on [executive
agreements](https://www.lawfareblog.com/death-article-ii-treaties) rather
than formal, ratified treaties: **[It has become increasingly difficult
to get]{.underline}** the latter **[through a divided
Congress]{.underline}**. Of equal concern is the possibility that other
states will be wary of making mutually beneficial agreements with the
United States, simply because they have no way to be sure whether an
agreement reached this year will survive the next election. **[People
who think U.S. interests are best served by avoiding international
agreements and maximizing the country's freedom of action (e.g., John
Bolton) might welcome such a situation, but this view is dangerously
shortsighted]{.underline}**. The United States has benefited greatly
from a host of past agreements of various types, and it makes no sense
to encourage other states to have less and less confidence in the value
of U.S. pledges. **[Nobody expects the United States to act contrary to
its interests, but how can it expect other countries to do something it
wants in exchange for something they want, if they have no way of
knowing whether it will deliver]{.underline}**?

On August 22, 2017, **[the U.S. State Department announced its decision
to cut]{.underline}** economic and military **[aid to Egypt
by]{.underline}** up to **[\$300 million]{.underline}**. While Egypt's
deteriorating human rights record was cited by State Department
officials as the principal reason for these unexpected aid cuts, many
analysts have speculated that **[Egypt's close]{.underline}** economic
and security **[ties to North Korea were also behind Washington's sudden
decision to cut]{.underline}** financial **[assistance to
Cairo]{.underline}**. Even though Egypt has been a leading U.S. ally in
the Middle East since the 1970s, **[Cairo remains one of Pyongyang's
leading trade partners]{.underline}** in the Arab world. **[Egypt's
close links to Pyongyang can be explained by historical bonds born out
of both countries' shared Cold War experiences]{.underline}** as
non-aligned Soviet allies, **[and the Egyptian military's long-standing
interest in procuring North Korean military tech]{.underline}**nology.
Even though Egyptian foreign policy has undergone numerous realignments
since Gamal Abdel Nasser assumed power in 1952, **[Cairo's close
relationship with North Korea has remained]{.underline}** a
**[consistent]{.underline}** feature of Egypt's Asia-Pacific strategy
**[since the dawn of the Cold War]{.underline}**. The persistence of
cordial relations between Egypt and North Korea can be explained by both
countries' membership in the non-aligned movement (NAM) and shared
solidarity with the Soviet Union during the 1950s and 1960s. The
anti-Western sentiments that made Nasser a leading figure within the NAM
revealed themselves in striking fashion during the 1956 Suez Crisis.
**[Egypt's decision to nationalize the Suez Canal received enthusiastic
support from Pyongyang. As Nasser successfully withstood a military
intervention from the U]{.underline}**nited **[K]{.underline}**ingdom,
**[Israel and France,]{.underline}** North Korea's leader **[Kim Il-sung
authorized the donation of a small but symbolic sum of financial
assistance to Egypt]{.underline}**, to demonstrate his approval of
Nasser's anti-imperial defiance. North Korea's alignment with Egypt
during the Suez Crisis set the stage for a strengthened Cairo-Pyongyang
alliance during the 1960s. In 1961, a North Korean diplomatic delegation
arrived in Egypt with the intention of establishing consular relations.
**[To cement an alignment with Cairo, North Korean policymakers provided
diplomatic support for Egypt's efforts to push British troops out of
South Yemen and]{.underline}** fiercely **[condemned Israeli conduct
during the [1967 Six-Day
War.](https://thediplomat.com/2017/05/why-did-north-korea-just-threaten-israel/)]{.underline}** These
actions increased trust between Egypt and North Korea and encouraged the
Egyptian air force's most senior commander, Hosni Mubarak, to enlist
North Korean pilots to assist Egypt's war effort against Israel in 1973.
**[Even though Egypt's strategic partnership with the United States
stigmatizes overt displays of cooperation with North Korea, the
Cairo-Pyongyang [diplomatic
partnership](https://www.pri.org/stories/2011-02-08/north-korea-and-egypt-friends-benefits) has
survived due to ongoing communication]{.underline}** between leaders of
both countries **[and shared]{.underline}** economic
**[interests]{.underline}**. The establishment of person-to-person
contacts between the Egyptian and North Korean governments, consolidated
by Mubarak's four visits to Pyongyang from 1983-1990, laid the
foundation for subsequent Egyptian investments in the North Korean
economy. The most striking demonstration of Cairo's willingness to
invest in North Korea was Egyptian telecommunications giant Orascom's
establishment of Koryolink, the DPRK's [only 3G mobile
phone](https://www.northkoreatech.org/2011/10/17/orascom-planning-3g-internet-service/) network,
in 2008. This business deal, which was authorized by Egyptian
billionaire Naguib Sawiris, gave Orascom 300,000 new North Korean
customers. This deal highlighted the potential for mutually beneficial
economic links between the two countries, and Sawiris's subsequent
visits to Pyongyang facilitated further Egyptian investments in the
North Korean economy. **[In spite of the political turmoil that followed
Mubarak's ouster in 2011, the Cairo-Pyongyang economic partnership has
remained intact]{.underline}**. As Egypt's Port Said remains a critical
trans-shipment point for North Korean arms exports to Africa, Egyptian
President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has upheld his predecessors' North Korea
policy and refused to enforce UN sanctions against Pyongyang. Egypt's
Interest in North Korean Military Technology In addition to maintaining
diplomatic ties and valuable trade links with the DPRK, **[Egyptian
policymakers have viewed North Korea as a critical supplier of military
technology since the]{.underline}** 19**[70s]{.underline}**. To reward
North Korea for its contributions to Egypt's 1973 war effort, President
Anwar el-Sadat authorized the sale of Soviet-made [Scud-B
missiles](http://pomed.org/blog-post/egypts-north-korea-relationship/) to
the DPRK from 1976-1981. The North Korean military responded to Cairo's
missile sales by technologically assisting Egypt's Scud-B missile
production efforts. Despite the establishment of a cold peace between
Egypt and Israel in 1979, and a strengthened U.S.-Egypt alliance under
Hosni Mubarak, **[Cairo remains a major purchaser of North Korean
military tech]{.underline}**nology. Egypt's decision to maintain
security links with North Korea can be explained by two strategic
factors. **[First, the North Korean government has helped train
Egypt]{.underline}**ian scientists **[to produce their own missile
systems]{.underline}**, in exchange for hard currency provisions from
Cairo. This arms-for-hard currency trade agreement helps reduce Egypt's
reliance on foreign arms imports, and allows Egypt to modernize its
military without being solely reliant on the United States and Russia.
Egypt's missile industry has particularly benefited from close military
links with North Korea. During the 1990s, Egypt's defensive capabilities
were enhanced by Mubarak's purchases of Scud-C missiles from North
Korea. These procurements encouraged North Korean scientists to assist
Egypt's Scud-C missile production program during the late 1990s and
early 2000s. More recently, **[Iran's ballistic missile tests have
caused Egyptian military officials to express interest in purchasing new
surface-to-surface missile systems]{.underline}**, for defensive and
retaliatory purposes. As North Korea continues to export air defense
systems and satellite-guided missile technologies across the Middle East
and Sub-Saharan Africa, **[Pyongyang has re-emerged as a useful security
partner for Cairo, as Egypt seeks to [help its leading
ally](http://www.dw.com/en/egypts-el-sissi-visits-saudi-arabia-in-bid-to-mend-ties/a-38553387),
Saudi Arabia, militarily balance against Iran]{.underline}**. **[Second,
the Egyptian government's continued refusal to accept comprehensive
international inspections of its nuclear energy program, has increased
concerns in Washington that Egypt could seek its own nuclear
deterrent,]{.underline}** if Iran violates the 2015 nuclear deal. This
theory is substantiated by the IAEA's discovery of [highly enriched
uranium](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joe-cirincione/egypts-nuclear-dimension_b_822588.html) at
Ishas in 2007 and 2008, which occurred in spite of Mubarak's rhetorical
commitment to a nuclear-free Middle East. **[As the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and Russia both oppose
Egypt's procurement of nuclear weapons, North Korea could be a useful
supplier of nuclear material to Egypt]{.underline}**, if Cairo seeks to
revive its uranium enrichment program. As many defense analysts believe
that rising tensions between the U.S. and Egypt under Sisi increase the
risk of Egypt procuring its own nuclear deterrent, **[Trump's decision
to cut aid to Egypt could convince Sisi to expand Cairo's long-standing
defense partnership with North Korea]{.underline}**. This outcome would
underscore the inefficacy of international sanctions against the DPRK
and lead to a profound political backlash against Trump's use of
coercive diplomacy with Egypt. Even though the United States has been
Egypt's principal great power ally for four decades, **[Egypt has
refused to give up its long-standing economic, diplomatic and military
partnership with North Korea]{.underline}**. Therefore, Trump's
unexpected decision to cut foreign aid to Egypt leaves Sisi with an
uncomfortable choice between reluctantly kowtowing to U.S. demands and
risking a long-termsuspension of the Washington-Cairo security
partnership.

**[Anarchy has not come to Africa -- at least not in the expanding,
all-encompassing way meant by the pessimists of a decade or two
ago.]{.underline}** The continent is far from uniformly peaceful, and
current outbreaks of violence are reminders of the need for more
progress. On the whole, however, **[Africa is less war-torn than at any
time in the past, which runs contrary to widespread perceptions that
exist even among foreign policy experts.]{.underline}** Kaplan remains
unchanged, claiming recently that his most important predictions have
actually been borne out.95 However, **[the evidence suggests that
despite neo-Malthusians fears, by most measures life on the continent is
improving. War is becoming less of a threat to the life of the average
African than emerging middleincome threats like traffic accidents or
diabetes.]{.underline}** Nor have realist fears of predatory wars and
wholesale remaking of the map of Africa come to pass. That is not meant
to dismiss the suffering of residents of the Central African Republic,
South Sudan or northern Nigeria, nor to suggest that all is well.
**[There are hundreds of millions of Africans who do not face as great a
threat of armed conflict]{.underline}** as they once did, however. It is
important to see Africa as more than 50 distinct countries, some -- and
by historical standards, relatively few -- of which are beset by
warfare, even if they continue to face other, even greater challenges.
Nothing guarantees that these trends will continue. Indeed, several
require active maintenance. **[If the outside world stops responding to
African hotspots, at least with diplomatic resources and avoiding
support to plunder-financed armed groups, conflict becomes more
likely.]{.underline}** Intense American --Chinese competition could
encourage internal conflict or spur vicious circles of tension between
neighbours. **[The United Nations, former colonizers and AFRICOM have
all been useful in helping to bring stability to the continent, but
their long-term interest is hardly assured.]{.underline}** A global
recession or a wave of protectionism could dash optimism about economic
growth. But for now, for the first time in quite some time, **[there is
reason for optimism about the decline of warfare in
Africa]{.underline}**. What the United States and other outsiders should
not do, however, is continue to look at Africa though a lens that
overemphasizes conflict and a few crisis-afflicted nations. Additional
American support for African peacekeeping capability is welcome, but an
increase in American investment in African economies would do even more
good for more people. Policymakers should emphasize to the business
community how much is now going right in Africa. The Obama
Administration has taken useful steps in that direction, but at other
times shows signs of the 'Africa-as-Anarchy' mindset. Programmes to help
African governments build capacity outside the military-security sphere
could be expanded, such as police and judicial systems, or the
infrastructure and service delivery needs of large cities in which a
growing share of Africans live. Africa faces many problems. **[Peace
does not necessarily bring freedom, justice, or prosperity. But today a
far greater percentage of people on the continent live without serious
risk of dying due to warfare than pessimists expected.]{.underline}** On
the contrary, 'end of war' optimists may prove to be right about Africa
too, if on a slower time scale than most of the world. Perhaps a rising
generation of leaders and citizens are being influenced by both global
norms and expectations of greater opportunities. Africa is surely the
hardest test of the global trend away from international conflict. If
conflict can no longer find a home there, will it be welcome anywhere?

As with Saudi Arabia and Turkey, if Iran were to obtain nuclear weapons
in the coming years, it would place significant pressure on Egypt to
follow suit. To assess the likely Egyptian response to Iranian nuclear
weapons, it is helpful to catalog the incentives and disincentives that
would influence the Egyptian decision. **[In terms of
incentives]{.underline}**, **[if Iran were to acquire nuclear
weapons,]{.underline}** **[the leading motivation for an Egyptian
pursuit of nuclear weapons would not necessarily be a fear of Iran, but
rather a fear of marginalization]{.underline}**. An
**[Iranian]{.underline}** **[acquisition]{.underline}** of nuclear
weapons **[would tempt Egypt to follow suit in order to reclaim and
maintain Egypt\'s traditional role as regional]{.underline}**
**[power]{.underline}** and reassert its position as leader of the Arab
world. Egyptians would view a nuclear armed Iran as a threat to Egypt\'s
power and influence in the region. In other words, an Iranian
acquisition of a nuclear weapon would shift the balance of power away
from Egypt and toward Iran. Many Egyptians would undoubtedly conclude
that Egyptian possession of its own nuclear weapons would most
effectively redress the balance of power. As discussed below, these
Egyptian motivations would be greatly magnified if Saudi Arabia
responded to an Iranian bomb by pursuing one as well. **[As powerful as
these incentives would be, the disincentives appear
greater]{.underline}**. Two pillars undergird Egyptian national security
strategy: **[peace with Israel and a security partnership with the
United States]{.underline}**. While both **[Israel and America remain
very unpopular with the Egyptian people, the Egyptian regime relies on
peace with Israel and aid from the United States to maintain its
security and its power.]{.underline}** An Egyptian **[pursuit of nuclear
weapons would destabilize]{.underline}**\--if not topple\--**[the
Israeli and American pillars of Egypt\'s national security
strategy]{.underline}**. Egyptian leaders considering a pursuit of
nuclear weapons would need to consider the Israeli response. In the
past, Egypt has had difficulty concealing and protecting its nuclear
activities from Israeli surveillance and intervention. There is no
reason to believe a new Egyptian nuclear weapons program would evade
Israeli attention. Such **[an Egyptian program]{.underline}** and the
Israeli response **[could reignite open hostility between the two
states]{.underline}**. Additionally, and perhaps most importantly, **[an
Egyptian nuclear weapons program could severely damage the bilateral
relationship between Egypt and the United States]{.underline}**.
**[Egypt leans heavily on U.S. aid]{.underline}**, as well as U.S.
military assistance, **[and an Egyptian nuclear weapons program would
endanger both]{.underline}**. Therefore**[, as long as peace with
Israel]{.underline}** **[and a security relationship with the United
States remain in Egypt\'s interest]{.underline}**, **[the disincentives
for an Egyptian nuclear weapons program appear to outweigh the
incentives]{.underline}**. As important as the relationship with the
United States remains to the Egyptian regime, the United States would be
wise to not take this bilateral relationship for granted. The current
relationship between Egypt and the United States has seen better days.
Mubarak and other Egyptian leaders have uncharacteristically lashed out
at the United States in recent years.\\5\\ Mubarak and the inner-circle
of Egyptian decisionmakers have expressed deep frustration with U.S.
policy. The Egyptians believe the United States has behaved rashly and
incompetently in Iraq and has served as a destabilizing influence in the
region. They also resent the conditioning of Foreign Military Sales
(FMS) on democratic reform and public statements from high-level
officials condemning the humanitarian track record of the Mubarak
government. The Egyptians see the Middle East as unstable, placing much
of the blame on the United States. Referring to the 2001 U.S. invasion
of Afghanistan, the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, and the 2006 war
between Israel and Hezbollah, one Egyptian official said, \`\`wars are
coming closer and becoming more numerous.\'\'

CAIRO - 27 February 2018: **[Minister of Foreign Affairs Sameh
Shoukry]{.underline}** **[stressed]{.underline}** **[during the
Conference on Disarmament]{.underline}** (CD) held on Tuesday
**[that]{.underline}** **[all]{.underline}** **[countries should be
committed to the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty
(NPT]{.underline}**). Shoukry confirmed that CD has been in stalemate
for over two decades and has been regrettably unable to adopt a program
of work that allows the conference to carry out its duties, despite the
efforts exerted in this regard. He added that **[the reasons behind this
situation should be revised to]{.underline}** **[double]{.underline}**
**[the efforts for reversing the status quo]{.underline}**,
**[preserving the]{.underline}** **[integrity of the
conference]{.underline}** **[and its ability to resume its
responsibilities in advancing the international security]{.underline}**
as it is the only forum where negotiations on disarmament are held. "If
the CD is to break its deadlock and restore its historic and central
role in the field of disarmament, **[all states must resist prioritizing
national interests at the expense of advancing collective
security]{.underline}**," said Shoukry. He further explained that
**[Egypt supports]{.underline}** the presidency of the conference and
its **[constructive efforts to adopt a comprehensive program of work,
expressing Egypt's aspirations for the conference's 2018 edition to
restore its effective role]{.underline}** **[in negotiating the
international agreements]{.underline}** and treaties on disarmament.
Shoukry expressed that Egypt welcomes the conference's recent decision
to establish five subsidiaries on the conference's agenda as a very
important step towards adopting a comprehensive and balanced work
program in the future. He remarked that **[although Egypt and many
international parties have long called in many forums for complete
elimination of nuclear weapons and parties' commitment to the
NPT]{.underline}**, **[no actions have been taken in this regard as
nuclear weapons still exist in the world, threatening]{.underline}** the
**[international security.]{.underline}** "Equally important, **[the
inability of the international community to achieve the universality of
the NPT until now has impacted the treaty negatively. The continued non
adherence of a few states to the NPT has questioned whether the NPT will
be able to achieve its objectives."]{.underline}** He said that the
**[instability in the Middle East is worsened by the existence of
states]{.underline}** non party **[to the treaty and the readiness of
some parties to protect the interests of those states]{.underline}**,
**[reaffirming the importance of Israel joining the NPT]{.underline}**
and for its nuclear facilities to be placed under the comprehensive
safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to achieve
peace and stability across world. In this regard, Shoukry called on all
states to address the threats in the Middle East by establishing a zone
free of weapons of mass destruction to preserve security in the region.
"**[Egypt has been at the forefront calling to achieve this
objective,]{.underline}** emanating from its deep conviction that **[the
path to security in the Middle East must be based on collective
security,]{.underline}** **[rather than selective security in a
manner]{.underline}** that is beneficial to all states of the region."

[The Trump administration released \$195 million in military aid to
Egypt]{.underline}, U.S. and Egyptian officials said Wednesday,
[allowing Cairo to access funds Washington withheld last year over
concerns about the country's human-rights record and relationship with
North Korea.]{.underline} [A State Department spokesperson]{.underline}
[said]{.underline} the [funds had been released in recognition of "steps
Egypt has taken]{.underline} over the last year [in response to specific
U.S. concerns."]{.underline} [The decision ends]{.underline} a nearly
[yearlong standoff that strained relations with]{.underline} one of
Washington's closest allies in the Middle East during a period of
otherwise warm ties rooted in a personal affinity between President
Donald Trump and [Egypt]{.underline}'s President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi.
The situation was an illustration of how U.S.-Egyptian ties have been
tested in recent years by the turmoil that followed the 2011 Arab Spring
uprising and the 2013 military takeover that ushered in Mr. Sisi's
government. [For decades Washington]{.underline} has [considered Egypt a
force for stability in the Middle East and]{.underline} a key partner in
the fight against extremist groups, but the political unrest of the last
eight years has opened cracks in the relationship. The Trump
administration initially withheld the funds in 2017 after Mr. Sisi
signed a controversial law that restricts the work of nongovernmental
organizations. [Washington also objected to Egypt's longstanding ties
with the pariah regime of North Korea, including arms sales between the
two countries]{.underline}. **[It wasn't clear what steps the Egyptian
government had taken to address American concerns.]{.underline}** The
2017 law conscribing the work of NGOs remains in place, as does a 2013
conviction by a Cairo court of at least 16 Americans---most of them in
absentia---working with democracy-promotion groups in Egypt. "[There
remain areas of concern, and we will continue to make clear the need for
progress in addressing them," said the State Department
spokesperson,]{.underline} referring to the 2013 conviction. A spokesman
for Egypt's Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed the funding had been
released but declined to comment further. The decision to grant Egypt
access to the funding came during a visit to Washington by a group of
senior Egyptian officials, including Abbas Kamel, Egypt's powerful spy
chief. The release of the funds mirrored a drama that unfolded during
the Obama administration, analysts said. Former President Barack Obama
froze transfers of cash and military equipment to Egypt following the
2013 military coup led by Mr. Sisi, only to lift the ban in 2015 after
nearly two years of acrimony between the two governments. In both cases,
critics said the two administrations surrendered leverage over Egypt
having extracted few if any concessions. "It's a signal: Don't pay
attention to anything we say in the future," said Michele Dunne, a
former State Department official who is now director of the Middle East
Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.
Egypt is the second-largest recipient of American military aid in the
world after Israel. The largest country in the Arab world, Egypt
receives approximately \$1.3 billion in assistance each year in an
arrangement that is part of the legacy of the U.S.-brokered 1979
Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty. Egypt's government has been repeatedly
criticized by human-rights groups in recent years as its security forces
have carried out a vast crackdown on political opponents, jailing tens
of thousands in the aftermath of the 2013 coup. Under Mr. Sisi, the
government recently accelerated the clampdown, carrying out a wave of
arrests of prominent dissenters and critics of the regime. Given the
apparent lack of change in Egyptian policies, some analysts suggested
the shift in the U.S. approach reflected changes made by the new
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is seen as more sympathetic to
conservative Arab governments than his predecessor Rex Tillerson was.
"Secretary Pompeo determined that releasing these funds is important to
supporting these needs and continuing to improve our partnership with
Egypt," said a State Department official.

Last August, **[a secret message was passed from Washington to Cairo
warning about a mysterious vessel steaming toward the Suez
Canal]{.underline}**. The bulk freighter named Jie Shun was flying
Cambodian colors but had sailed from North Korea, the warning said, with
a North Korean crew and an unknown cargo shrouded by heavy tarps. Armed
with this tip, customs agents were waiting when the ship entered
Egyptian waters. They swarmed the vessel and discovered, concealed under
bins of iron ore, a cache of more than 30,000 rocket-propelled grenades.
It was, as a United Nations report later concluded, the \"largest
seizure of ammunition in the history of sanctions against the Democratic
People\'s Republic of Korea.\" But who were the rockets for? The Jie
Shun\'s final secret would take months to resolve and would yield
perhaps the biggest surprise of all: The buyers were the Egyptians
themselves. A U.N. investigation uncovered a complex arrangement in
which Egyptian business executives ordered millions of dollars worth of
North Korean rockets for the country\'s military while also taking pains
to keep the transaction hidden, according to U.S. officials and Western
diplomats familiar with the findings. The incident, many details of
which were never publicly revealed, prompted the latest in a series of
intense, if private, U.S. complaints over Egyptian efforts to obtain
banned military hardware from Pyongyang, the officials said. **[It also
shed light on a little-understood global arms trade that has become an
increasingly vital financial lifeline for North Korea]{.underline}**n
leader Kim Jong Un in the wake of unprecedented economic sanctions.
\"Egypt will continue to abide by all Security Council resolutions and
will always be in conformity with these resolutions as they restrain
military purchases from North Korea,\" the statement said. But **[U.S.
officials confirmed that delivery of the rockets was foiled only when
U.S. intelligence agencies spotted the vessel and alerted Egyptian
authorities through diplomatic channels --- essentially forcing them to
take action --- said current and former U.S. officials]{.underline}**
and diplomats briefed on the events. The officials, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. and U.N. findings, said **[the
Jie Shun episode was one of a series of clandestine deals]{.underline}**
that led the Trump administration to freeze or delay nearly \$300
million in military aid to Egypt over the summer. **[Whether North Korea
was ever paid for the]{.underline}** estimated \$23 million **[rocket
shipment is unclear]{.underline}**. But the episode **[illustrates one
of the key challenges faced by world leaders in seeking to change North
Korea\'s behavior]{.underline}** through economic pressure. **[Even as
the United States and its allies pile on the sanctions, Kim continues to
quietly reap profits from selling cheap conventional weapons and
military hardware to a list of customers and
beneficiaries]{.underline}** that has at times
**[included]{.underline}** Iran, Burma, Cuba, Syria, Eritrea and at
least two terrorist groups, as well as **[key U.S. allies such as

"**[Let's always look for peace and development]{.underline}**, our
people need that. They don't need us arguing and entering conflict,"
**[Sisi said]{.underline}** at an inauguration of new projects in the
province of Monofeya. **[He said Egypt would not interfere in other
countries' affairs]{.underline}**. Khartoum has in the past accused
Cairo of political meddling while Egypt has accused Sudan of harboring
Egyptian Islamists. "**[Egypt will not fight its brothers \... I'm
saying this as a message to our brothers in Sudan," Sisi
said.]{.underline}** Khartoum and Ankara agreed last month that Turkey
would rebuild a ruined Ottoman port city on Sudan's Red Sea coast and
construct a dock to maintain civilian and military vessels. Egyptian
officials reacted with suspicion about what they see as Turkey's plans
to expand its influence in the region. Separately, **[Ethiopia is
building a hydroelectric dam on the Nile which Cairo fears will restrict
the waters flowing down from Ethiopia's highlands and through Sudan to
Egypt.]{.underline}** Ethiopia, which wants to become Africa's biggest
power exporter, says it will have no such impact. Egypt believes Sudan
is leaning toward the Ethiopian position in the dispute. The Ethiopian
foreign minister, who held talks with his Sudanese counterpart on
Sunday, is expected to visit Cairo later this week for negotiations
after multiple delays.

CAIRO --- **[The ongoing cooperation between Egypt and North Korea under
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has led Washington to reiterate
calls on Egypt to freeze such ties. This comes amid leaks that the
US]{.underline}** State **[Department\'s suspension of]{.underline}**
military **[aid]{.underline}** to the Egyptian government
**[was]{.underline}** not **[linked to]{.underline}** Egypt's human
rights record as stated, but to **[these]{.underline}** **[specific
ties, especially at the military level, as Pyongyang failed to respond
to US pressure]{.underline}** not to conduct a long-range missile test.
On Aug. 23, the United States suspended \$195 million in military aid to
Cairo and delayed an additional \$95.7 million. The White House said in
a July 5 statement that US President Donald Trump called his Egyptian
counterpart. According to the statement, **[Trump stressed the threat
from North Korea and the need for all countries to fully implement UN
Security Council resolutions on North Korea, stop hosting North Korean
guest workers]{.underline}** **[and stop providing economic or military
benefits to the country.]{.underline}** The relationship between North
Korea and Egypt was confirmed in a report issued by the United Nations
on Feb. 23, 2015, whereby the North Korean Ocean Maritime Management
Company (OMM) played a key role in arranging the illicit shipment of
concealed arms through individuals and entities based in Egypt and other
countries. The UN report said that OMM representatives were embedded in
a company (Sunlight Agency) in Port Said at least until 2011. The State
Information Service (SIS), an official government body affiliated with
the presidency, describes on its official website Egypt\'s relations
with North Korea as "historic," and pointed out that the two countries
are tied by around 20 economic, security, media, technology and cultural
agreements, among others. The SIS website states, "The volume of the
Egyptian Orascom Group\'s direct investments in the Democratic People\'s
Republic of Korea has exceeded half a billion dollars, which puts
Egyptian investments at the top of the pyramid of foreign investments in
Korea." Also, Sisi had invited North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in May
2015 to attend the opening ceremony of the new Suez Canal. The
invitation was welcomed by his Korean counterpart, who sent the
president of the Presidium of the Supreme People\'s Assembly of North
Korea, Kim Yong-nam, to attend the ceremony on Aug. 5, 2015. "Relations
with Egypt will develop under Sisi," North Korea\'s military attache at
the Korean Embassy in Cairo, Ju Haq Shul, said April 23 on the 85th
anniversary of the founding of the North Korean army. He said that he is
"certain the development will also include the relationship between the
Egyptian and North Korean armies." Egypt is one of three Arab countries
(in addition to Syria and Palestine) that still have an operating
embassy in Pyongyang. It is also one of only five Arab countries to host
a North Korean Embassy on its territory, the other countries being
Syria, Algeria, Kuwait and Libya. **[While a statement issued by the
Egyptian Foreign Ministry]{.underline}** in January 2016 **[condemned
North Korea\'s missile test, a spokesman for the ministry
described]{.underline}** in a TV interview on Jan. 7, 2016, **[the
relationship between the two countries as]{.underline}** **[strong and
stable.]{.underline}** He said that **[Egypt's criticism of North
Korea]{.underline}**'s missile test **[stems from its membership in the
Security Council]{.underline}** and its role in limiting the
proliferation of nuclear weapons. Egypt reiterated its condemnation of
North Korea\'s nuclear test in a statement issued on Sept. 5 and
expressed its "deep concern over North Korea\'s noncompliance with the
relevant Security Council resolutions and its new nuclear test, which
poses a threat to regional security in East Asia." Former Assistant
Foreign Minister Gamal Bayoumi told Al-Monitor that **[the condemnation
issued by the Egyptian Foreign Ministry is merely aimed]{.underline}**
**[at proving Egypt\'s position on the principle of nuclear
proliferation as a member of the Security Council]{.underline}**. He
stressed that **[the strength of relations between Egypt and North Korea
will not prompt Cairo to cut off relations with the Korean
side]{.underline}** **[nor reduce]{.underline}** its **[diplomatic
missions despite US pressure,]{.underline}** as cooperation exists
between the two countries. **[Asked about the US calls on Cairo to
freeze its relations with North Korea]{.underline}**,
**[Egyptian]{.underline}** **[Foreign Ministry spokesman Ahmed Abu Zeid
told Al-Monitor,]{.underline}** "**[Egypt is managing its relations with
foreign countries based on its own interests and
priorities]{.underline}** **[without taking into account any pressures
that may hinder the independence]{.underline}** **[of its national
decision]{.underline}**." **[Abu Zeid declined to comment on reports
establishing a link between the Washington aid freeze and Cairo\'s
relationship]{.underline}** with North Korea, and said, "I cannot

**[As a result of foreign policy miscalculations, the United States may
lose its historical leadership in the Middle East]{.underline}**. While
the **[unfolding tragedy in Syria, Iran's nuclear ambitions and the war
on terrorists absorb U.S. attention and resources,]{.underline}** the
unnecessary **[decline of U.S.-Egyptian relations could do the most
damage to our national interests]{.underline}**. Just as Britain's
domination of the region ended on the banks of the Suez Canal in 1956,
Washington now appears determined to end our 30 years of regional
dominance in a confrontation with the Egyptian people. U.S. pre-eminence
in the region since the 1970s was built on the strategic cooperation
between Washington and Cairo. Presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and
Jimmy Carter strove to create this relationship, for they realized that
the preceding 20 years of predominant Soviet influence in the region was
due to the Egyptian-Soviet partnership. Egypt was and remains the
dominant force in the Middle East. Since World War II, the balance of
power in the region has shifted twice. First in the 1950s, when Egypt
led the region into a de facto alliance with the Soviet Union. Then, in
the 1970s, when Anwar Sadat decided Egypt's interests were better served
by allying with the U.S. In the 1950s, the Middle East underwent a
political transformation with Arab nationalism's emergence as the
dominant political philosophy --- radically changing the way Arabs
perceived themselves. The West's misunderstanding and mishandling of
this change ended Britain's moment and ushered in the Soviet era. Now
the region is undergoing a similar transformation. Sclerotic Arab
**[nationalist regimes are being]{.underline}** **[supplanted by
governments with a more populist Islamic orientation. Egypt is at the
forefront of this shift.]{.underline}** Other Arab states are watching
with concern because they know that **[how Egypt weathers this
transformation will significantly affect the region.]{.underline}**
Egypt, while the leader in the Arab world, is also unique. Across the
Arab world, if one asks, "Who are you?" the majority answers, "I am a
Muslim." In Egypt, however, the majority answers: "I am an Egyptian." As
a consequence, the rise of Islamic political forces in Egypt is tempered
by a parallel rise in Egyptian nationalism. This dual Islamic and
Egyptian identity presents both opportunities and challenges for U.S.
policymakers. The crisis in U.S.-Egyptian relations over the
nongovernmental organization issue --- including calls from some in
Congress and the media to halt military assistance --- creates a direct
and unnecessary clash with this rising tide of Egyptian nationalism.
Though Cairo eased tensions Thursday by allowing the seven detained U.S.
citizens to leave, the problem remains unresolved. Parallels with the
1950s are worrying. Attempts to blame an individual for the problem ---
President Gamal Abdel Nasser in the 1950s and Minister Fayza Abul Naga
today --- can lead to a serious misreading of the underlying cause.
These people reflect national feelings --- they are not creating them.
Consider the Egyptian perspective. Under Egyptian law, foreign and
domestic NGOs, including those with foreign funding, must be registered.
The NGOs in question were not, and therefore operating illegally. The
situation was worsened by the Obama administration's post-revolution
decision to increase exponentially the funding for these NGOs --- though
they were operating without Cairo's approval and in violation of
Egyptian law. This situation was complicated when several employees of
one U.S. NGO quit. One went on Egyptian television and accused that NGO
of spying, discriminating against Muslims and violating other laws.
Egyptian judges decided to prosecute these groups after months of
investigation --- a decision supported by the overwhelming majority of
Egyptians. U.S. pressure on Cairo, particularly the military leadership,
to abrogate the legal proceedings and make an exception for Americans is
widely seen in Egypt as proof that Washington is not truly interested in
the rule of law and must have another agenda --- as the Egyptian judges
have alleged. **[Cutting off military assistance could call into
question the entire U.S.-Egyptian relationship and severely damage the
national security interests of both countries for
decades]{.underline}**. **[In return for U.S. aid, Egypt waives its laws
in allowing passage of U.S. Navy ships through the Suez Canal, military
use of its facilities and the annual transit of many thousands of U.S.
military aircraft]{.underline}**. This **[loss to our military would be
huge in terms of cost and efficiency for U.S. military operations in
Southwest Asia and Northeast Africa. Washington now has a choice. Either
we find a way to work with the Islamists and nationalists or continue
along the path of confrontation --- which is likely to]{.underline}**

East.]{.underline}**

visit overlaps with the Muslim Holy month of Ramadan. It also comes
after the Islamic State's December attack on Coptic Christians in Minya,
which killed 29 and injured 25 (including many children), and two
attacks on Christians during Palm Sunday ceremonies in the cities of
Tanta and Alexandria, which killed 45 Christians and wounded over 100.
The Muslim Brotherhood, an organization banned in Egypt (as well as in
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates), is not directly responsible
for the latest attacks. But their ongoing rhetoric on social media does
incite and inspire terrorist groups. Among other threats, lies, and
deceptions, Muslim Brotherhood leader Abdul Mawgoud el-Dardery blamed
Christians for the "crisis," indicating that violence will end only when
Christians align themselves with "Muslims," by which he means radical
Islamists. The upcoming visit is timely and represents an opportunity to

Last August, the United States decided to deny Egypt \$95.7 million in
aid and to delay an additional \$195 million because of concerns about
human rights under Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Sisi was elected president
after he led the army in ousting Mohammad Mursi. His government then
enacted a law restricting the activities of nongovernmental
organizations -- part of a wider crackdown on dissent. Under Sisi scores
of websites have been taken down and journalists and opponents have been
arrested. In a 2017 State Department memo to Congress, U.S. officials
wrote that the "overall human rights climate in Egypt continues to
deteriorate, with the government enacting legislation that conflicts
with its human rights obligations, including the right of peaceful
assembly, freedom of association, freedom of expression, and due process
guarantees." In March voters elected Sisi to a second term, in an
election that saw all major opposition candidates cut short their
campaigns, citing intimidation. Yet **[despite Sisi's record on human
rights, it is still in the United States' interests to support Egypt.
Doing so will help hold the line against IS and prevent Egypt from
turning to a country like Russia for security and economic
cooperation]{.underline}**. Washington should adopt a two-track approach
with Egypt, as it has historically done with Turkey, advancing security
issues at the same time it pushes for improvements in human rights and
democracy. **[Egypt has long been a critical U.S. security partner
because of its control of the Suez Canal and its border with Israel.
When U.S. forces are engaged in the region, Egypt provides expedited
access for U.S. naval vessels transiting the Suez Canal and overflight
rights for U.S. military aircraft, both of which are crucial for the
United States' ability to project power across the Middle
East]{.underline}**. **[Its role as a linchpin of regional stability has
grown with multiple forces roiling the Middle East in recent years. Amid
Iranian and Russian entrenchment in the Levant, and the recent rise in
IS and Hamas operations, Egypt has remained squarely in the camp of
secular and reformist Middle Eastern countries trying to stop the spread
of Islamist extremism. Cairo is working with Israel to contain IS in the
Sinai and Hamas in Gaza, and the countries' navies coordinate regularly
on Mediterranean security issues]{.underline}**. I met with Sisi in May,
when I visited Egypt as part of a delegation sponsored by the Jewish
Institute for National Security of America, and he **[was keen to
emphasize the common security interests Cairo shares with Washington and
Jerusalem, and his desire to advance both partnerships. Egypt's internal
security is threatened by a relentless IS-affiliated insurgency in
Sinai]{.underline}**. In November the group attacked a Sinai mosque,
killing more than 300 people. Egypt also faces the ever-present
challenge of preventing the conflict in Libya from spilling over its
western border. (While Cairo and Washington both want a stable Libya,
the Sisi government is backing Gen. Khalifa Haftar, a military strongman
who was once a CIA asset; the United States is supporting his rival and
UN-backed Libyan government.) **[Further instability in Egypt would be
disastrous for its nearly 100 million citizens, the region and the
United States]{.underline}**. **[Regardless of which might come first --
the collapse of Egypt's economy or the spread of Islamist insurgency --
the other would surely follow. The result would be new extremist safe
havens, millions of desperate Egyptians seeking to flee to Europe, an
existential threat to Israel, the disruption of the Suez Canal upon
which global economic stability depends and the potential for the United
States to get involved in yet another Middle East
quagmire]{.underline}**. Recent American support for Egypt's
counterterrorism efforts in Sinai and the resumption of Bright Star
joint military exercises are both steps in the right direction. So is
the United States' recent decision to provide Egypt with its
fully-authorized \$1.3 billion in foreign military financing. **[Egypt
needs this assistance to replenish military capabilities expended
combatting IS in Sinai, and to respond effectively to any IS resurgence.
It will also help improve bilateral military interoperability and
promote Egypt's continued phaseout of Soviet-era
weaponry.]{.underline}** U.S. assistance should also include greater
technical support for U.S. equipment that Egypt uses in the Sinai and
more bilateral military exchanges, including sharing U.S.
lessons-learned from counterterrorism operations in Iraq, Afghanistan
and Syria. **[These policy changes can bolster Washington's influence in
Cairo, helping to disrupt Russia's shaping of a Middle East security
environment reminiscent of the Cold War. They can also capitalize on a
fleeting opportunity to defeat the scourge of IS by advancing an
important relationship and promoting economic development and democracy
in a vital Middle East partner.]{.underline}**

Since the 1979 Israeli-Egyptian Peace Treaty, **[the United States has
provided Egypt with large amounts of military assistance. U.S.
policymakers have routinely justified this aid to Egypt as an investment
in regional stability]{.underline}**, built primarily on long-running
military cooperation and sustaining the treaty---principles that are
supposed to be mutually reinforcing. **[Egypt has used U.S. military aid
through the FMF to (among other things) purchase major U.S. defense
systems, such as the F-16 fighter aircraft, the M1A1 Abrams battle tank,
and the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter]{.underline}**. Frequently Asked
Question: Is U.S. Military Aid Provided to Egypt as a CashTransfer? No.
All U.S. military aid to Egypt finances the procurement of weapons
systems and services from U.S. defense contractors. 82 The United States
provides military assistance to U.S. partners and allies to help them
acquire U.S. military equipment and training. **[Egypt is one of the
main recipients of FMF, a program with a corresponding appropriations
account administered by the Department of State but implemented by the
Department of Defense]{.underline}**. **[FMF is a grant program that
enables governments to receive equipment and associated training from
the U.S. government or to access equipment directly through U.S.
commercial channels]{.underline}**. Most countries receiving FMF
generally purchase goods and services through government-to-government
contracts, also known as Foreign Military Sales (FMS). According to the
Government Accountability Office, "under this procurement channel, the
U.S. government buys the desired item on behalf of the foreign country
(Egypt), generally employing the same criteria as if the item were being
procured for the U.S. military." The vast majority of what Egypt
purchases from the United States is conducted through the FMS program
funded by FMF. Egypt uses few of its own national funds for U.S.
military equipment purchases. Under Section 36(b) of the Arms Export
Control Act (AECA), Congress must be formally notified 30 calendar days
before the Administration can take the final steps of a
government-to-government foreign military sale of major U.S.-origin
defense equipment valued at \$14 million or more, defense articles or
services valued at \$50 million or more, or design and construction
services valued at \$200 million or more. In practice prenotifications
to congressional committees of jurisdiction occur, and proposed arms
sales generally do not proceed to the public official notification stage
until issues of potential concern to key committees have been resolved.
**[Realigning Military Aid from Conventional to Counterterrorism
Equipment For decades]{.underline}**, **[FMF grants have supported
Egypt's purchases of large-scale conventional military equipment from
U.S. suppliers. However, as mentioned above,]{.underline}** the Obama
Administration announced that future FMF grants may only be used to
purchase equipment specifically for Egypt also receives**[, though not
consistently, relatively small sums from the Nonproliferation,
Antiterrorism, Demining, and Related Programs]{.underline}** (NADR**[)
account and the International Narcotics Control and Law
Enforcement]{.underline}** (INCLE) **[account. NADR funds support
counterterrorism training through the Antiterrorism Assistance
Program]{.underline}**. **[INCLE funds support police training and
respect for human rights in law enforcement. The Administration
typically requests these funds, but they are not usually specifically
earmarked for Egypt (]{.underline}**or for most other countries) in
legislation. After the passage of a foreign operations appropriations
bill, federal agencies such as the State Department and the U.S. Agency
for International Development (USAID) allocate funds to Egypt from these
aid accounts. They then submit a country allocation report (653a Report)
to Congress for review. 82 For the relevant legal authorities, see §604
of the Foreign Assistance Act as amended (22 U.S.C. 2354) and §503 of
the Foreign Assistance Act as amended (22 U.S.C. 2311). **[Egypt:

"counterterrorism, border security, Sinai security, and maritime
security]{.underline}**" (and for sustainment of weapons systems already
in Egypt's arsenal).83 It is not yet clear how the Trump Administration
will determine which U.S.-supplied military equipment would help the
Egyptian military counter terrorism and secure its land and maritime
borders. Overall, some defense experts continue to view the Egyptian
military as inadequately prepared, both doctrinally and tactically, to
face the threat posed by terrorist/insurgent groups such as Sinai
Province. According to a former U.S. National Security Council official,
"they \[the Egyptian military\] understand they have got a problem in
Sinai, but they have been unprepared to invest in the capabilities to
deal with it." 84 To reorient the military toward unconventional
warfare, the Egyptian military needs, according to one assessment,
"heavy investment into rapid reaction forces equipped with sophisticated
infantry weapons, optics and communication gear \... backed by enhanced
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance platforms. In order to
transport them, Egypt would also need numerous modern aviation assets."
85 **[Special Military Assistance Benefits for Egypt In addition to
substantial amounts of annual U.S. military assistance, Egypt has
benefited from certain aid provisions that have been available to only a
few other countries.]{.underline}** For example  Early Disbursal and
Interest-Bearing Account: Between FY2001 and FY2011, Congress granted
Egypt early disbursement of FMF funds (within 30 days of the enactment
of appropriations legislation) to an interest-bearing account at the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York.86 Interest accrued from the rapid
disbursement of aid has allowed Egypt to receive additional funding for
the purchase of U.S.-origin equipment. In FY2012, Congress began to
condition the obligation of FMF, requiring the Administration to certify
certain conditions had 83 According to a 2015 GAO report on U.S.
assistance to Egypt, DSCA "led a review of Egypt's FMF program to align
current purchases with shared security interests and to make
recommendations on whether to continue to support specific systems
through FMF. As part of this review, DSCA identified some systems that
did not directly align with shared security interests. These included
some older, outdated, or third-party produced systems, such as
Chinese-built submarines and Russian-made surface-to-air missiles, as
well as U.S.-manufactured Gulfstream VIP aircraft and M1A1 tank kits.
DSCA recommended continuing support for 18 of these systems totaling
\$6.5 billion, but identified 15 of these systems totaling \$777 million
that should be transitioned from FMF funds to Egyptian government funds
or ended." See GAO-15-259, "EGYPT U.S. Government Should Examine Options
for Using Unobligated Funds and Evaluating Security Assistance
Programs," February 2015. 84 "In Egypt, Furious Retaliation but Failing
Strategy in Sinai," New York Times, November 25, 2017. 85 "Egypt's
Conventional Military Thinking," Stratfor, June 12, 2015. 86 By law,
Egypt and Israel are permitted to earn interest on congressionally
appropriated Foreign Military Financing (FMF). During the late 1990s,
the Clinton Administration (especially the U.S. Defense Department) and
the Egyptian government sought to increase U.S. military aid to Egypt.
One proposal had been to grant Egypt a benefit already enjoyed by
Israel---the use of an interest-bearing account in which unspent FMF
funds can accumulate interest to be used for future purchases. During
Senate consideration of legislation to provide Egypt access to an
interest-bearing account, Sen. Mitch McConnell remarked that "In the
State Department briefing justifying the request, U.S. officials urged
our support because of Mubarak's need to address the requirements of
'his key constituents, the military.' Frankly, I think Mr. Mubarak needs
to worry less about satisfying the military and spend more time and
effort shoring up democratic institutions and civic society." See
Congressional Record-Senate, S5508, June 21, 2000. In October 2000,
Congress passed P.L. 106-280, the Security Assistance Act of 2000, which
authorized FY2001 FMF funds for Egypt to be disbursed to an
interest-bearing account in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The
law required that none of the interest accrued by such account should be
obligated unless first notified to relevant congressional appropriations
and oversight committees. In November 2000, Congress passed P.L.
106-429, the FY2001 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, which
included an interest-bearing account for Egypt in appropriations
legislation. Since then, this provision has remained in annual
appropriations legislation, most recently in P.L. 114-113, the
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. Egypt: Background and U.S.
Relations Congressional Research Service 24 been met before releasing
FMF funds, thereby eliminating their automatic early disbursal. However,
Congress has permitted Egypt to continue to earn interest on FMF funds
already deposited in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The Excess
Defense Articles (EDA) program provides one means by which the United
States can advance foreign policy objectives---assisting friendly and
allied nations through provision of equipment in excess of the
requirements of its own defense forces. The Defense Security Cooperation
Agency (DSCA) manages the EDA program, which enables the United States
to reduce its inventory of outdated equipment by providing friendly
countries with necessary supplies at either reduced rates or no charge.
As a designated "major non-NATO ally," Egypt is eligible to receive EDA
under Section 516 of the Foreign Assistance Act and Section 23(a) of the

the threat of IS, which will gain a crucial foothold that can expand
into other parts of the Middle East.]{.underline}** For its part,
**[Egypt must integrate modern counter-terrorism techniques into its
military doctrine.]{.underline}** In the past year, **[IS has lost most
of its territories in Iraq and Syria. But having established a powerful
base in Egypt]{.underline}** since 2013, **[IS shifted its attention
from Iraq and Syria to Egypt]{.underline}**. **[There has been a
continuous Islamist insurgency in Northern Sinai led by more than 1,000
IS fighters]{.underline}**. The Sinai insurgency has had drastic
consequences: the take-down of a Russian passenger plane in 2015 that
killed all 224 people on board; the attacks on the Multinational Force
of Observers (MFO), including American personnel Task Force of Sinai;
the killing of more than 250 people in the al-Rawda mosque bombing of
November 2017, and the targeting of Egypt's Minister of Defense and
Minister of Interior during their visit to al-Arish airport in December
2017. In February 2018, Egypt's military started Operation Sinai,
involving land, naval and air forces, plus police and border guards, to
target terrorist organizations in northern and southern Sinai. After two
weeks of military operations, Mohamed Farid, chief of staff of the armed
forces, asked President Sisi to extend the campaign by at least three
months. Farid justified his request by noting the terrorist
organizations' extensive possession of explosives and the hardships that
Egypt's forces face in residential areas. In fact, the Egyptian Army has
been incapable of countering IS expansion because it lacks advanced
relevant training for its aircrews and enhanced ground forces training
in urban combat. **[Current American aid to Egypt has strengthened
Egypt's ability for conventional warfare, but has not enhanced the
capabilities necessary to defeat IS in Sinai]{.underline}**. The
Egyptian army's failure underscores the need to re-evaluate the
effectiveness of the \$1.3 billion in annual U.S. military support. This
aid started as compensation for Egypt's peace deal with Israel, by
providing an alternative arms supplier to Cairo, and establishing a
semi-military deterrence between Egypt and Israel. Today, however, the
United States cannot and should not shoulder this responsibility alone.
European nations, NATO, and Israel also have a vested interest in
countering IS threats in this region, and should play an active role in
increasing Egyptian counter-terrorism capability. To be sure, the United
States finds it challenging to convince the Egyptian government to
accept counter-terrorism training and its integration into its military
doctrine. Nevertheless, **[the U.S. should reorient its military
relations with Egypt and build more international support to counter the
growing Islamist insurgency in Sinai. The U.S. should also persuade the
European counterparts to conduct counter-insurgency training for the
Egyptian ground and air forces.]{.underline}** Egyptian-European
military exercises are still limited to naval operations, which have
historically played a role in Egypt's patrol of the southern
Mediterranean Sea and the prevention of illegal immigration to Europe.
In light of IS expansion into Northern Sinai, such naval cooperation is
insufficient and broader cooperation is needed immediately. **[The
Egyptian army has been skeptical of any pressure from the U.S. regarding
Egypt's military operations. Egypt has always perceived U.S. military
aid in its current form as compensation]{.underline}** for the peace
treaty with Israel, **[and would perceive any revision of U.S. military
aid as an unfriendly act.]{.underline}** But th**[e current landscape
offers the most opportune moment to restructure the Egyptian army for

regime's need for a quick win to reinvigorate its legitimacy among
Egyptians. The **[U.S. can still pressure the Egyptian leadership to
change its arm deals priorities to include the needed counter-terrorism

**[As a result of foreign policy miscalculations, the United States may
lose its historical leadership in the Middle East]{.underline}**. While
the **[unfolding tragedy in Syria, Iran's nuclear ambitions and the war
on terrorists absorb U.S. attention and resources,]{.underline}** the
unnecessary **[decline of U.S.-Egyptian relations could do the most
damage to our national interests]{.underline}**. Just as Britain's
domination of the region ended on the banks of the Suez Canal in 1956,
Washington now appears determined to end our 30 years of regional
dominance in a confrontation with the Egyptian people. U.S. pre-eminence
in the region since the 1970s was built on the strategic cooperation
between Washington and Cairo. Presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and
Jimmy Carter strove to create this relationship, for they realized that
the preceding 20 years of predominant Soviet influence in the region was
due to the Egyptian-Soviet partnership. Egypt was and remains the
dominant force in the Middle East. Since World War II, the balance of
power in the region has shifted twice. First in the 1950s, when Egypt
led the region into a de facto alliance with the Soviet Union. Then, in
the 1970s, when Anwar Sadat decided Egypt's interests were better served
by allying with the U.S. In the 1950s, the Middle East underwent a
political transformation with Arab nationalism's emergence as the
dominant political philosophy --- radically changing the way Arabs
perceived themselves. The West's misunderstanding and mishandling of
this change ended Britain's moment and ushered in the Soviet era. Now
the region is undergoing a similar transformation. Sclerotic Arab
**[nationalist regimes are being]{.underline}** **[supplanted by
governments with a more populist Islamic orientation. Egypt is at the
forefront of this shift.]{.underline}** Other Arab states are watching
with concern because they know that **[how Egypt weathers this
transformation will significantly affect the region.]{.underline}**
Egypt, while the leader in the Arab world, is also unique. Across the
Arab world, if one asks, "Who are you?" the majority answers, "I am a
Muslim." In Egypt, however, the majority answers: "I am an Egyptian." As
a consequence, the rise of Islamic political forces in Egypt is tempered
by a parallel rise in Egyptian nationalism. This dual Islamic and
Egyptian identity presents both opportunities and challenges for U.S.
policymakers. The crisis in U.S.-Egyptian relations over the
nongovernmental organization issue --- including calls from some in
Congress and the media to halt military assistance --- creates a direct
and unnecessary clash with this rising tide of Egyptian nationalism.
Though Cairo eased tensions Thursday by allowing the seven detained U.S.
citizens to leave, the problem remains unresolved. Parallels with the
1950s are worrying. Attempts to blame an individual for the problem ---
President Gamal Abdel Nasser in the 1950s and Minister Fayza Abul Naga
today --- can lead to a serious misreading of the underlying cause.
These people reflect national feelings --- they are not creating them.
Consider the Egyptian perspective. Under Egyptian law, foreign and
domestic NGOs, including those with foreign funding, must be registered.
The NGOs in question were not, and therefore operating illegally. The
situation was worsened by the Obama administration's post-revolution
decision to increase exponentially the funding for these NGOs --- though
they were operating without Cairo's approval and in violation of
Egyptian law. This situation was complicated when several employees of
one U.S. NGO quit. One went on Egyptian television and accused that NGO
of spying, discriminating against Muslims and violating other laws.
Egyptian judges decided to prosecute these groups after months of
investigation --- a decision supported by the overwhelming majority of
Egyptians. U.S. pressure on Cairo, particularly the military leadership,
to abrogate the legal proceedings and make an exception for Americans is
widely seen in Egypt as proof that Washington is not truly interested in
the rule of law and must have another agenda --- as the Egyptian judges
have alleged. **[Cutting off military assistance could call into
question the entire U.S.-Egyptian relationship and severely damage the
national security interests of both countries for
decades]{.underline}**. **[In return for U.S. aid, Egypt waives its laws
in allowing passage of U.S. Navy ships through the Suez Canal, military
use of its facilities and the annual transit of many thousands of U.S.
military aircraft]{.underline}**. This **[loss to our military would be
huge in terms of cost and efficiency for U.S. military operations in
Southwest Asia and Northeast Africa. Washington now has a choice. Either
we find a way to work with the Islamists and nationalists or continue
along the path of confrontation --- which is likely to]{.underline}**

East.]{.underline}**

President Donald Trump took office. The administration's hope is that
the effort, tentatively known as the Middle East Strategic Alliance
(MESA), might be discussed at a summit provisionally scheduled for
Washington on Oct. 12-13, several sources said. The White House
confirmed it was working on the concept of the alliance with "our
regional partners now and have been for several months." Saudi officials
raised the idea of a security pact ahead of a Trump visit last year to
Saudi Arabia where he announced a massive arms deal, but the alliance
proposal did not get off the ground, a U.S. source said. Sources from
some of the Arab countries involved also said they were aware of renewed
efforts to activate the plan. Officials from other potential
participants did not respond to requests for comment. "MESA will serve
as a **[bulwark against Iranian aggression, terrorism, extremism, and

**[Undeterred by decades of carnage and the disastrous outcomes of prior
conflicts, ideologues within the Trump administration are clamoring for
military action against Iran.]{.underline}** The **[exact basis for this
escalation varies]{.underline}**. Common among the allegations are
**[concerns over Iran's civilian nuclear program, in spite of Iranian
compliance with the Non-Proliferation Treaty]{.underline}**, Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action (**[the Iran nuclear deal]{.underline}**)
**[and]{.underline}** their Safeguards Agreement with the **[IAEA. Other
pro-intervention voices decry Iran's alleged sponsorship of terror
organizations or cite a general concern for U.S. interests in the region
as a pretext for action. This view of the Iranian regime is overly
narrow and ahistorical]{.underline}**. Iran is a conservative state in a
region otherwise awash in radicalism**[. Any military action undertaken
by the United States or its allies against the regime in Tehran will
represent a grave error.]{.underline}** Sponsorship of terror
organizations or extremist groups is a hallmark of nearly all Middle
Eastern states. Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait have both lent financial
and material support to Sunni extremist groups involved in the Syrian
Civil war, Yet both remain in good standing as U.S. allies. Even Israel
has aided rebels groups in Syria near its border, though Jerusalem
denies that it is supporting extremists. Iran is not beyond reproach,
for it has maintained relationships with Hezbollah and Hamas. However,
these groups, while on the State Department's terrorist list, do not
threaten the United States. **[The claim that the Iranian regime harbors
or supports Al Qaeda is patently absurd and easily
disproven.]{.underline}** Prior to the start of the Global War on
Terror, Iran supported the foremost adversary of Al Qaeda in
Afghanistan, the confederation of warlords known as the Northern
Alliance. Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, the Iranian
government handed over photocopies of three hundred passports associated
with suspected Al Qaeda members to the United Nations. Of these three
hundred, many would be forcibly deported back to Saudi Arabia and other
Arab countries. In an additional gesture of good will, the Iranian
regime offered to provide search and rescue support, humanitarian relief
and targeting assistance in the fight against the Taliban and Al Qaeda
to then-Deputy Secretary of State for Near East Affairs Ryan Crocker.
America was initially receptive, accepting Iranian assistance in the
Bonn Conference that oversaw the creation of the post-Taliban Afghan
government. Special Envoy James Dobbins would later state that the
Iranians were "comprehensively helpful" in the post 9/11 period. Despite
being rebuffed by George W. Bush's "Axis of Evil" speech, the Iranians
nevertheless doubled down on their commitment to positive bilateral
relations with the United States. In a memorandum personally endorsed by
Ayatollah Khamenei and delivered with the aid of Swiss Diplomat Tim
Guldimann, the Iranian government offered to assist the United States in
targeting Al Qaeda, submit to full transparency in its nuclear energy
program, cease support for Palestinian groups, pressure Hezbollah into
transitioning into a purely political organization, and recognize the
two state concept for Israel-Palestine put forth in the Arab League
Beirut Summit. Through false attribution of an Al Qaeda attack in Riyadh
to Tehran, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld were able to dissuade
President Bush from additional talks with Iran. Then-Undersecretary of
State for Arms Control John Bolton successfully lobbied for the removal
of the Swiss intermediary Guldimann, further reducing the hope for
future talks. In spite of these setbacks, Iran maintained its opposition
to Al Qaeda. From the cache of documents removed from the Abbottabad
residence of al Qaeda's slain leader, Osama bin Laden, it is known
through translated correspondence that many members of the terror group
who attempted to flee into Iran after the United States invaded
Afghanistan were arrested by Iranian military and intelligence services.
By April of 2003, Iranian forces had captured a number of higher profile
Al Qaeda members like the architects of the 1998 Kenya and Tanzania
embassy bombings, Saif Al-Adl and Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah, along with a
former top lieutenant of Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi, Khalid Mustafa Al-Aruri.
Those detained in Iran also included two sons, a daughter, and a wife of
Osama bin Laden. Though an exact inventory of the captured is
inaccessible, it is known that with the exception of two escapees, Enan
and the late Sa'd bin Laden, many al Qaeda members remained in custody
at least until 2010, when a few were exchanged for a kidnapped Iranian
diplomat in Pakistan. Had the United States agreed to continue
cooperating with Iran for counter-terrorism purposes, it could have
traded captured members of the anti-Iranian-regime Mujahideen-e Khalqh
(MEK) from the battlefield in Iraq for an Al Qaeda lieutenant like Said
Al-Adel or heir apparent Hamza bin Laden, rather than losing them back
to the battlefield. Figures such as former CIA director and current
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and organizations like the Foundation
for the Defense of Democracies (FDD), still insist that an operational
relationship exists between Iran and Al Qaeda. This shouldn't come as a
surprise, as claims like these are a staple in pre-war propaganda
campaigns. In reality, as the detailed analysis of the records from
Osama bin Laden's Abbottabad compound by West Point's Combating
Terrorism Center (CTC) shows, relations between al Qaeda and Iran have
been consistently antagonistic. The presence of Al Qaeda in Iran is only
represented by prisoners of the regime. With Al Qaeda active in
contiguous states, captive Al Qaeda members represent negotiating
leverage and a deterrent against future attacks. Attacks by Al Qaeda
affiliates and splinter groups inside the country, such as a massive
attack in February on members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps,
have further undercut accusations that Iran is acting as a haven for
extremist groups. To counter these groups, Iran has deployed its forces
to the battlefields of Syria and Iraq, making considerable sacrifices in
combating the Islamic State, and these contributions should be regarded
as a critical factor in the defeat of the bin Ladenite factions and
splinter groups in both nations. **[An American military campaign
against Iran would only succeed at great cost]{.underline}**. **[The
Iranian military is better organized and equipped than many countries in
the region]{.underline}**. **[Through the use of intermediate range
missile]{.underline}**s, **[Iranian forces could effectively engage
large U.S. installations in Iraq, Kuwait, Afghanistan, Qatar, and
Bahrain, as well as U.S. Arab allies in the Persian Gulf. U.S. naval
vessels could be highly vulnerable to Iranian modern anti-ship missiles
as well. After the United States suppresses Iran's integrated air
defense systems and anti-aircraft fire, U.S. forces should be capable of
destroying the regime in Tehran, at least in the short term. However,
the prospect of occupying and stabilizing a country whose population and
landmass far exceed that of Iraq should be a formidable
deterrent]{.underline}**. If, after initial costs of \$2 trillion and
decades of U.S. involvement, Iraq is still in disarray, how could any
rational governing body logically pursue a similar strategy against a
country over three times the size, with a complex topography and an
equally diverse ethnic and religious landscape? The Iranian regime,
while imperfect, does maintain a general stasis between the varied sects
of Shia and Sunni Muslims in the country. **[Under the chaos of war and
foreign-military occupation, the outbreak of sectarian warfare like that
of Iraq is a real possibility]{.underline}**, **[made worse by the
virulently anti-Shia Al Qaeda and ISIS waiting at the
periphery.]{.underline}** **[Prolonged and extensive
carnage]{.underline}** **[would surely follow.]{.underline}** Further
complicating such a campaign would be the presence of the **[Marxist
guerilla cult and U.S. foreign-policy establishment
favorite]{.underline}**, the Mujahideen-e Khalqh
(**[MEK]{.underline}**), who would also be **[vying for control of the
state, despite that their popular support inside Iran is approximately
nonexistent]{.underline}**. The combination of these factors seriously
**[diminishes the long-term probability of success for a U.S. invasion
of Iran.]{.underline}** Some reporting last year suggested that the
administration was considering launching a series of air attacks based
on Bill Clinton's "**[Operation Desert Fox]{.underline}**" model. This
would be **[based on the premise that the Iranians would be too smart to
dare fight back and provoke even worse American wrath]{.underline}**. Of
course, this would seem to be a **[fairly optimistic take from those
claiming that Iranian aggression against U.S. forces is forcing them to
respond militarily in the first place.]{.underline}** That **[Iran's
so-called provocations are exaggerated and that they are likely to
defend themselves with force if attacked would seem to be the more
reasonable assessment.]{.underline}** As with all military incursions
undertaken by the United States during the Global War on Terror, a
**[major victor will be the Al Qaeda members who sought to draw U.S.
forces deeper into the Middle East for the purpose of waging a war of
financial attrition against the United States and destabilizing U.S.
regional allies]{.underline}**. There is little doubt that Osama bin
Laden would have loved to see the United States attack and overthrow
another of Al Qaeda's enemies, this time the Shia mullahs of Iran, and
sow a whole new generation of sectarian war, and warriors, throughout
formerly stable, opposition-held Iran.

### 1NC Alliances Turn -- Peace Process

#### The aff causes collapse of U.S.-Egypt relations -- that crushes U.S. influence in the Middle East

**Bannerman 12** (Graeme Bannerman, B.A. at Northwestern University,
Ph.D. at University of Wisconsin, former staffer for Middle East and
South Asia on US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 3-7-2012,

**[As a result of foreign policy miscalculations, the United States may
lose its historical leadership in the Middle East]{.underline}**. While
the **[unfolding tragedy in Syria, Iran's nuclear ambitions and the war
on terrorists absorb U.S. attention and resources,]{.underline}** the
unnecessary **[decline of U.S.-Egyptian relations could do the most
damage to our national interests]{.underline}**. Just as Britain's
domination of the region ended on the banks of the Suez Canal in 1956,
Washington now appears determined to end our 30 years of regional
dominance in a confrontation with the Egyptian people. U.S. pre-eminence
in the region since the 1970s was built on the strategic cooperation
between Washington and Cairo. Presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and
Jimmy Carter strove to create this relationship, for they realized that
the preceding 20 years of predominant Soviet influence in the region was
due to the Egyptian-Soviet partnership. Egypt was and remains the
dominant force in the Middle East. Since World War II, the balance of
power in the region has shifted twice. First in the 1950s, when Egypt
led the region into a de facto alliance with the Soviet Union. Then, in
the 1970s, when Anwar Sadat decided Egypt's interests were better served
by allying with the U.S. In the 1950s, the Middle East underwent a
political transformation with Arab nationalism's emergence as the
dominant political philosophy --- radically changing the way Arabs
perceived themselves. The West's misunderstanding and mishandling of
this change ended Britain's moment and ushered in the Soviet era. Now
the region is undergoing a similar transformation. Sclerotic Arab
**[nationalist regimes are being]{.underline}** **[supplanted by
governments with a more populist Islamic orientation. Egypt is at the
forefront of this shift.]{.underline}** Other Arab states are watching
with concern because they know that **[how Egypt weathers this
transformation will significantly affect the region.]{.underline}**
Egypt, while the leader in the Arab world, is also unique. Across the
Arab world, if one asks, "Who are you?" the majority answers, "I am a
Muslim." In Egypt, however, the majority answers: "I am an Egyptian." As
a consequence, the rise of Islamic political forces in Egypt is tempered
by a parallel rise in Egyptian nationalism. This dual Islamic and
Egyptian identity presents both opportunities and challenges for U.S.
policymakers. The crisis in U.S.-Egyptian relations over the
nongovernmental organization issue --- including calls from some in
Congress and the media to halt military assistance --- creates a direct
and unnecessary clash with this rising tide of Egyptian nationalism.
Though Cairo eased tensions Thursday by allowing the seven detained U.S.
citizens to leave, the problem remains unresolved. Parallels with the
1950s are worrying. Attempts to blame an individual for the problem ---
President Gamal Abdel Nasser in the 1950s and Minister Fayza Abul Naga
today --- can lead to a serious misreading of the underlying cause.
These people reflect national feelings --- they are not creating them.
Consider the Egyptian perspective. Under Egyptian law, foreign and
domestic NGOs, including those with foreign funding, must be registered.
The NGOs in question were not, and therefore operating illegally. The
situation was worsened by the Obama administration's post-revolution
decision to increase exponentially the funding for these NGOs --- though
they were operating without Cairo's approval and in violation of
Egyptian law. This situation was complicated when several employees of
one U.S. NGO quit. One went on Egyptian television and accused that NGO
of spying, discriminating against Muslims and violating other laws.
Egyptian judges decided to prosecute these groups after months of
investigation --- a decision supported by the overwhelming majority of
Egyptians. U.S. pressure on Cairo, particularly the military leadership,
to abrogate the legal proceedings and make an exception for Americans is
widely seen in Egypt as proof that Washington is not truly interested in
the rule of law and must have another agenda --- as the Egyptian judges
have alleged. **[Cutting off military assistance could call into
question the entire U.S.-Egyptian relationship and severely damage the
national security interests of both countries for
decades]{.underline}**. **[In return for U.S. aid, Egypt waives its laws
in allowing passage of U.S. Navy ships through the Suez Canal, military
use of its facilities and the annual transit of many thousands of U.S.
military aircraft]{.underline}**. This **[loss to our military would be
huge in terms of cost and efficiency for U.S. military operations in
Southwest Asia and Northeast Africa. Washington now has a choice. Either
we find a way to work with the Islamists and nationalists or continue
along the path of confrontation --- which is likely to]{.underline}**
**[lead to an end of U.S. predominance in the Middle
East.]{.underline}**

expected to address at length a law on non-governmental organizations
that has steered a great deal of controversy. It was approved by
parliament last November, but not signed into law by el-Sisi until last
Monday. The law restricts NGOs to developmental and social activities,
and introduces jail time for non-compliance. The Egyptian parliament
defended the law as a "needed step in strengthening the national
security of the country." Economic partnership **[The bilateral

instrumental to shedding light on opportunities available in the
Egyptian market. Last October, executives from nearly 50 major U.S.
companies visited Egypt and this May, 35 members from Egypt visited
Washington D.C. for the annual Doorknock Mission. Fighting terror The
visit overlaps with the Muslim Holy month of Ramadan. It also comes
after the Islamic State's December attack on Coptic Christians in Minya,
which killed 29 and injured 25 (including many children), and two
attacks on Christians during Palm Sunday ceremonies in the cities of
Tanta and Alexandria, which killed 45 Christians and wounded over 100.
The Muslim Brotherhood, an organization banned in Egypt (as well as in
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates), is not directly responsible
for the latest attacks. But their ongoing rhetoric on social media does
incite and inspire terrorist groups. Among other threats, lies, and
deceptions, Muslim Brotherhood leader Abdul Mawgoud el-Dardery blamed
Christians for the "crisis," indicating that violence will end only when
Christians align themselves with "Muslims," by which he means radical
Islamists. The upcoming visit is timely and represents an opportunity to

strengthen cooperation, and address issues of concern. Since taking

Before HAMAS was created, Israel fought five major wars and numerous
other battles. Moreover, before HAMAS there were the PLO, Fatah, PFLP,
PFLP-GC, 15 May Organization, Abu Ali Mustapha Brigades, Al-\'Asifah,
Arab Liberation Front, Force 17, Black Hand , Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine - Special Command, Popular Resistance

Black September, Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
Doghmush, Omar Ben al-Khatib Warriors, Palestinian Liberation Army,
Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, Palestinian fedayeen, Swords of
Truth, Rejectionist Front, among other organizations. Today most of the
above organizations have been destroyed or just vanished. However, the
conflict has not ended as the above organizations have been replaced by
Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Holy Jihad Brigades, Izz ad-Din al-Qassam
Brigades, Army of Islam, As-Sa\'iqa, Tanzim, Al-Quds Brigades, among
others. The point here is that **[even if Israel destroys HAMAS, the
conflict between Israelis and Palestinians would not be solved and it
would only be a matter of time before a new group forms to replace
HAMAS.]{.underline}** Israelis and Palestinians must realize that
**[what they have done for the last 70 years will never bring peace to
either Palestine or Israel under the best of
circumstances.]{.underline}** Under the worst of circumstances **[this
conflict may lead to an all out nuclear war where millions will
die]{.underline}** **[and this is no longer an
exaggeration.]{.underline}**\
To summarize, **[Israel and its neighbors have fought numerous wars and
no side has given up on their fundamental claims]{.underline}**. For the
last 20 years, **[both sides have tried to separate by creating two
separate countries but this approach has failed because all sides have
attachments to Israel and Palestine. The only solution that has a record
of success is integration]{.underline}** as demonstrated by the
Palestinians who are citizens of Israel. **[If peace is not found then
the day may]{.underline}** **[soon come when the governments of the
Middle East maybe overthrown by people who want to directly intervene on
behalf of the Palestinians. If an uprising erupts throughout the Middle
East then nuclear war may soon follow]{.underline}**. Therefore, **[the
choices are between total annihilation or equality for
Palestinians]{.underline}** and security for Israel. **[There are no
other choices]{.underline}**.

### 1NC Alliances Turn -- Egypt Military Readiness

#### French and Russian fill-in now -- cutting US sales undermines US security interests and Egyptian military readiness

Suppliers to Escape U.S. Pressure,\" No Publication,

brt)

Earlier this month, La Tribune reported that **[France and Egypt are
moving forward on negotiations for another sale of]{.underline}**
Dassault Rafale **[fighter jets to the Egyptian Air
Force]{.underline}**.\[i\] Cairo and Paris are said to be negotiating on
a new agreement for the sale of up to two dozen Rafales to Egypt, on top
of the initial group of 24 ordered in 2015. Furthermore, Egypt may
procure another two Gowind 2500 corvettes and is interested in French
drones and helicopters. **[The deepening Egyptian-French relationship
comes as the volume of U.S. sales to Egypt has waned]{.underline}**.
**[In 2013,]{.underline}** in the months **[after the Egyptian military
overthrew President Mohamed Morsi, the U.S. announced a hold on the sale
of]{.underline}** "certain large-scale military systems" and **[military
assistance to Egypt,]{.underline}** "pending credible progress toward an
inclusive, democratically elected civilian government through free and
fair elections."\[ii\] **[The U.S. continued the sale of spare parts for
previously supplied systems, but otherwise suspended the delivery of
major hardware]{.underline}**, largely in line with U.S. law regarding
military coups,\[iii\] though the Obama administration did not formally
acknowledge Morsi's overthrow as such. **[Less than two years later, the
U.S. reversed its position]{.underline}**. Notably, **[this decision
followed the Egyptian presidential elections in 2014 that delivered 95
percent of the vote to President]{.underline}** Abdel Fattah
el-**[Sisi]{.underline}**.\[iv\] Perhaps in recognition that President
Sisi was here to stay, and **[worried about damage to the long-term
U.S.-Egypt alliance]{.underline}**, U.S. President Barack **[Obama
announced]{.underline}** in March 2015 **[that he would "lift executive
holds that have been in place since]{.underline}** October
**[2013]{.underline}** on the delivery of F-16 aircraft, Harpoon
missiles, and M1A1 tank kits."\[v\] **[This reversal]{.underline}** in
policy **[came without any of the intended changes in Egypt that the
Obama administration had initially sought]{.underline}**. Even so,
despite the end of the self-imposed suspension, the **[U.S.
has]{.underline}** for the most part **[not been able to cash in on
major arms sales to Egypt]{.underline}**. Maintenance and overhaul
support continue, landing regular work for American firms, and some new
deals have been reached. In September 2016, for example, the U.S. State
Department approved the sale of eight MPQ-64F1 Sentinel radars to Egypt,
and in November 2017, Raytheon received a contract to produce the radars
for Cairo.\[vi\] But **[since]{.underline}** President **[Sisi took
office, Egypt has turned to Russia and France for the big force
modernization contracts]{.underline}**. From Russia, Egypt purchased
dozens of MiG-29M/M2 fighter jets and Ka-52 attack helicopters. The
Egyptian military introduced Antey-2500 surface-to-air missile systems
into service and is to procure T-90S/SK main battle tanks. France has
sold Mistral helicopter carriers (initially destined for Russia) to
Egypt, along with a FREMM frigate, several Gowind 2500 corvettes, and
Rafale fighter jets. **[Further contracts with both countries are
planned, and]{.underline}** these sales **[will deepen
Egypt's]{.underline}** bilateral **[relations with these
countries]{.underline}** for years to come. **[Egypt's turn to France
and Russia for arms sales demonstrates several important features of the
arms trade in general]{.underline}**. President **[Sisi's ability to buy
from suppliers other than the U.S. limited Washington's ability to
directly pressure his decision-making on a sensitive
subject]{.underline}**, that being the nature of Egyptian elections. The
success of a Muslim Brotherhood candidate in 2012 spooked the Egyptian
military leadership, which in the aftermath of Morsi's ouster has not
been amenable to a repeat democracy experiment. The Brookings
Institution's Shadi Hamid observed that the 2013 massacre of supporters
of deposed President Morsi signaled the end of the "Arab Spring"
itself.\[vii\] Rather than bow to American pressure on an issue core to
his domestic concerns, President Sisi chose to lessen his dependence on
Washington by inking multibillion-dollar arms contracts with American
arms competitors. Diversifying arms suppliers is a financially expensive
endeavor and can lead to interoperability issues within a military and
between partner militaries. But politically, it allows flexibility and
preserves a measure of independence from any one supplier in particular.
Furthermore, American national security interests prevented Washington
from more aggressively pressuring Cairo. The 2013 hold on arms sales
noticeably exempted the supply of spare parts and support. **[Completely
cutting off military assistance to Egypt]{.underline}** was out of the
question, however, as doing so **[would result in both short-term damage
to the Egyptian military and long-term damage to U.S.-Egyptian
relations]{.underline}**. In the short term, **[Egypt's military
readiness would take a hit]{.underline}**. **[Egypt is engaged in a
counterinsurgency effort against Islamic State-linked militants in the
Sinai and these operations would be negatively impacted]{.underline}**
were Egypt unable to continue receiving support for its
American-supplied equipment. With quiet cooperation from Israel, Egypt
has made use of heavy equipment in the Sinai, such as American-supplied
F-16s and Apache helicopters,\[viii\] to combat militant groups. Over
the longer term, as a direct consequence of meddling in Egyptian
military readiness, **[the U.S. would have been perceived at best as an
untrustworthy supplier and poor security partner, cementing an Egyptian
shift to partners perceived to be more reliable]{.underline}**.
Washington's ability to influence Egypt on humanitarian matters, always
tenuous, would further erode. In understanding of Egypt's strategic
importance, the U.S. is keenly interested in returning to the Egyptian
market as part of a policy under U.S. President Donald Trump to promote
arms sales, and may be able to score contracts with the Egyptian
military, as numerous Egyptian modernization requirements remain. To do
so, however, the U.S. may be seeking to limit Egypt's ability to buy
from both France and Russia. Dassault CEO Éric Trappier suggested in a
March 2018 interview that he viewed American roadblocks to the sale of
Rafales to Egypt as indicative of the U.S.'s desire to return to the
Egyptian market.\[ix\] These blocks, according to La Tribune, which has
followed Egypt-France arms deals closely, have since been lifted in the
wake of high-level French protests, allowing the sale to move forward.
At least in theory, Egypt could be subject to sanctions under the U.S.'s
Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which came into
force earlier this year,\[x\] over purchases of Russian military
equipment. **[Given]{.underline}** the benefit **[that]{.underline}**
President **[Sisi has found in diversifying suppliers]{.underline}**,
however, **[his government may react negatively to American efforts to
cut Egypt off from other sources. U.S. pressure helped spur Egypt to
seek other suppliers; it is doubtful that further pressure will undo
this shift]{.underline}**.

**[Russia\'s defense industry is face to face with a major
foe]{.underline}**, but it\'s not a foreign military power. The Kremlin
has been striving to modernize all branches of the Russian military,
**[but the country\'s defense industry is struggling thanks to
decreasing volumes of orders]{.underline}**, difficulties in attracting
high-skilled talent and limits to its technological capabilities.
**[According to recent figures, the performance of Russia\'s aerospace
sector is declining precipitously. In 2018, for instance, Russian
aircraft and spacecraft makers produced 13.5 percent less than in
2017.]{.underline}** And **[there\'s been no letup in 2019 either: In
the first two months of the year, aerospace output plummeted 48 percent
year on year. The decline in Russia\'s defense output raises concerns
about the competitive strength of Russia\'s defense
industry]{.underline}** in general, whose health is critical if the
country is to project itself as a military power in the longer term.
**[Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov attributed the reduction
in output to a slowdown of orders for military systems,]{.underline}**
but projections suggest the slowdown is not just a short-term
fluctuation; in fact, it\'s expected to become even worse in the future.
The downturn in oil prices has taken a bite out of Russia\'s bottom
line, squeezing spending for the military --- all at a time when
**[the]{.underline}** **[country\'s arms manufacturers have lost their
competitive edge in the global arms market.]{.underline}** Together**[,
these factors ensure that Russia\'s defense industry will struggle to
get out of its funk.]{.underline}** Suffering From a Dearth of Funds
This dire picture stands in stark contrast to Russia\'s frequent
presentation of sensational new platforms. In reality, however, **[just
a few of the big-ticket weapon systems --- such as the T-14 main battle
tank or the Su-57 fighter aircraft --- find buyers, as the rest remain
mere prototypes. Russia has prioritized some hardware, such as the
Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, due to their strategic
relevance to the country\'s overall military posture,]{.underline}** but
**[Moscow has failed to fully develop other programs]{.underline}** or
only introduced them on a limited scale. Under pressure from a limited
government budget, the Kremlin even started reducing its military
spending in 2017 --- a strong indicator that, despite the modernization
push, **[Russia\'s financial challenges are taking a toll on the country
ambitions]{.underline}**. Economically, **[the plunge in oil
prices]{.underline}** at the end of 2014 **[hurt Russia\'s bottom line,
depriving the country of essential revenue and forcing it to dip into
its reserves to bridge the gap]{.underline}**. Today, more than four
years on, **[Russian oil revenues are rising, yet the country is
continuing to deal with the consequences of the lean
years]{.underline}**. Beyond that, low revenues from taxes, which have
forced Russia to raise taxes and the retirement age, and Western
sanctions over Moscow\'s activities in Ukraine and elsewhere, have
shrunk the financial pool available to military planners. Low oil
prices, declining revenues from taxes and Western sanctions have taken a
chunk out of the financial pool available to Russia\'s military and the
broader defense industry. But the Kremlin\'s problems don\'t end there.
In the past, **[Russia]{.underline}** has **[benefited from its position
as a major global arms exporter to fuel further military
development]{.underline}**. During the 1990s, for example, such **[sales
were critical to the country as it faced severe economic
hardship]{.underline}**. While Russia remains the world\'s
second-largest arms exporter (only the United States sells more),
**[the]{.underline}** actual **[value of]{.underline}** those **[exports
has been decreasing significantly. Between 2014 and 2018, their total
value dropped by as much as 17 percent]{.underline}**. Again, budgetary
limits are somewhat to blame: In the past, **[Russia frequently used
arms exports as a political tool, offering weapons at a heavy
discount,]{.underline}** **[if not entirely free. But with Russia no
longer able to offer customers a good deal on its fighter jets and other
defense products, the country is losing business.]{.underline}** And
Russia\'s arms industry faces an even greater problem in the years to
come: reduced competitiveness. **[Russia]{.underline}** has long
**[dominated]{.underline}** some of **[the market by offering affordable
military equipment without attaching any conditions regarding human
rights]{.underline}**, but the rise of China\'s military industry, as
well as several smaller producers around the world, has made it much
more difficult to compete for contracts. Ultimately, **[the loss of
export opportunities not only complicates Russia\'s efforts to finance
its defense industry, it also reduces the scale]{.underline}** **[at
which the defense industry produces]{.underline}**, which, in turn,
decreases scale-dependent savings that accompany higher levels of
production. In effect, this means that **[the more Russia fails to find
foreign customers for specific weapon systems, the more it will become
burdened with a higher relative cost per unit as it seeks to meet its
own needs. The conundrum]{.underline}**, in turn, **[will further limit
Russia\'s ability to competitively price weapons systems for export,
thereby perpetuating the effect]{.underline}**.

#### **Russia fills in -- close ties and no interoperability issues**

**Borshchevskaya 18 [-- senior fellow at The Washington Institute for
Near East Policy (Anna; "What Would Happen If Russia Flipped Egypt?";
6/26/18;]{.underline}**
<https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/what-would-happen-if-russia-flipped-egypt>**[;
accessed 7/7/19) dc]{.underline}**

**[Despite the constant media scrutiny of President Trump's foreign
policy, experts say that the U.S. relationship with Egypt has been
overlooked. This is particularly concerning given the strengthening ties
between Cairo and Moscow. Anna Borshchevskaya, the Ira Weiner Fellow at
The Washington Institute, talks with Madeleine Kearns of National Review
about the dangers posed by an Egypt-Russia alliance. Kearns: In 2013,
the Egyptian president Mohammed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood was
ousted by a military coup. In response, the Obama administration treated
his replacement, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, harshly. Has the Obama
administration's flirtation with the Muslim Brotherhood weakened the
U.S.-Egyptian relationship? If so, how? Borshchevskaya: Yes, it has.
Egypt grew increasingly mistrustful of the U.S. because of this
flirtation. Perhaps more important, though, Washington delayed weapons
deliveries to Egypt; it withheld military aid and later halted the
nascent bilateral strategic dialogue. These steps suggested to Cairo
that the U.S. was disengaging, it wasn't paying attention to its needs,
and the relationship began to deteriorate. Kearns: By contrast, and as
his critics have noted, President Trump has a warmer approach to
el-Sisi. So far he has invited him to the White House and engaged him
with personal phone calls. Does this signify a change in policy?
Borshchevskaya: It's unclear, in part because we often see
contradictions between what Trump does and what his administration does.
We often see Trump behaving in one way toward Putin, for example, and
his administration in another. It is Trump, for instance, who personally
keeps inviting Putin to a summit, and he congratulated him on the
election even as it was written to him in all caps, "DO NOT
CONGRATULATE." Another example is in Afghanistan. Trump initially wanted
to essentially outsource Afghanistan to private contractors, but in the
end the policy that came out did no such thing and frankly was better
than his predecessor's. It certainly appeared to take past mistakes into
account, one of which was announcing a specific date for a military
withdrawal. This of course is a more positive example. My basic point is
that it's hard to tell where things will end up, and I do sense that
policymakers aren't taking seriously the possibility that Russia could
flip Egypt. Kearns: Why do you think the U.S. isn't yet taking Russia's
interest in Egypt seriously? And what would your advice be to the Trump
administration going forward? Borshchevskaya: It seems the U.S. isn't
taking seriously the growing relationship between Cairo and Moscow.
Analysts and policymakers often tend to dismiss Cairo's flirtation with
Moscow as mere posturing, an attempt to get a better deal from the U.S.
but nothing more. This would be a mistake. Egypt, by expert accounts,
truly is interested in diversifying away from the U.S.; it's not just
mere posturing. And given the history of Moscow's ties with Egypt, it's
not surprising that Cairo is turning to Moscow again. Moscow provides a
lot that Washington can't: It doesn't precondition aid to improvement in
human rights, it doesn't prohibit secondary arms sales, and so forth.
Egyptians also feel comfortable operating Russian weaponry and
helicopters, and first-hand pilot accounts suggest that they are
well-suited for their needs. Thus, Russia provides something that is
truly useful to Egypt, which is fighting an ISIS-affiliated insurgency
in the Sinai. I also would like to add that we often hear correctly that
Russia cannot replace the U.S.---whether when it comes to Egypt or other
countries in the region---and it sounds reassuring. The problem is this:
Russia doesn't have to replace the U.S. to damage U.S. interests.
Frankly, Putin understands he can't replace the U.S., and he has no such
aims. My advice would be to take the possibility of Russia's flipping
Egypt seriously, not to dismiss what's happening as mere posturing.
Egypt is the cornerstone of American regional security in the Middle
East, and if it turns to Putin we would lose one of our key regional
allies. That Putin is building Egypt's nuclear-power plant, when Egypt
used to be our partner on energy cooperation, shows that when we ignore
Egypt's needs---both when it comes to security and energy---they find
other, less palatable partners. Kearns: Given the recent criticisms of
Egypt's human-rights record, especially in the run-up to March's
election, how should the U.S. engage President el-Sisi on these issues?
Borshchevskaya: The Obama administration ultimately couldn't negotiate a
release of Aya Hijazi. Perhaps having close cooperation on security and
other issues could give us better leverage to engage Egypt on
human-rights issues. Our values remain important. We shouldn't abandon
them. An Egypt that is in the Putin camp will only drive Egypt further
away from these values.]{.underline}**

#### Current US relations with the Middle East are blocking Russia from expanding its arms sales -- but they've shown already shown interest in Egypt

**Khlebnikov 04/08** -- expert on the Middle East at the Russian
International Affairs Council. (Alexey, 04/08/19, "Russia looks to the
Middle East to boost arms exports,"
<https://www.mei.edu/experts/alexey-khlebnikov)> np

**[According t]{.underline}**o the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute's (**[SIPRI]{.underline}**) recently published annual
[report](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2019-03/fs_1903_at_2018.pdf),
**[Russia's share of global arms exports shrank by around one-fifth over
the last decade,]{.underline}** **[falling from 27]{.underline}**
percent **[to 21 percent, while the U.S. share increased from
30]{.underline}** percent **[to 36 percent, widening the gap between the
two]{.underline}** major arms exporters. **[As Russia looks to reverse
this decline, it is focusing on the Middle East,]{.underline}** the
world's second-largest and fastest-growing arms market, as a way to
boost its exports. While it is early days, the effort seems to be paying
off so far. According to [Russian media
reports](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3915483), **[Russia and Egypt
recently signed a new arms deal worth at least \$2 billion. This
deal,]{.underline}** which involves the purchase of over 20 4++
generation Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets (Flanker-E), **[makes Egypt a major
importer of Russian arms]{.underline}** and comes on top of previous
deals between the two countries for tens of MiG-29 jets, Ka-52K
helicopters, and coastal defense units. In addition to the deal with
Egypt, Russia is also moving ahead with the sale of the S-400
anti-aircraft system to Turkey in yet another confirmation of Moscow's
growing focus on the Middle East. Whether this shift will be enough to
compensate for the broader decline in Russia's global market share,
however, is another question entirely. For their part, Russian officials
have pushed back against this narrative,
[refuting](https://tass.ru/ekonomika/6205266) SIPRI's analysis. They
argue that in recent years the volume of Russian arms exports has
actually increased and its portfolio of orders
[reached](https://tsargrad.tv/news/indija-i-kitaj-glavnye-klienty-rosteh-zajavil-o-rekordnyh-obemah-jeksporta-rossijskogo-oruzhija_188402)
a record \$51 billion in 2018. That said, it is important to note that
SIPRI aims to define trends in global arms transfers and
[calculates](https://www.sipri.org/databases/armstransfers/background)
volumes based on the military value of the equipment rather than its
market price. As a result, even if Moscow did reach a record in 2018,
the broader trend of a declining Russian share of the global arms market
is still quite clear. A downward trend: Exports in decline What's
driving this trend? Global political and economic developments --- and
their negative impact on Russia's ability to secure new arms deals ---
may be a partial explanation. The confrontation between Russia and the
West, which was exacerbated by the Ukraine crisis in 2014 and Moscow's
subsequent campaign in Syria, plays an important role in this regard.
**[Sanctions imposed by the U.S. and its European allies]{.underline}**
may eventually **[hamper Russia's ability to sign new arms
contracts]{.underline}**, and for now **[the U.S. seems set on using
them to ramp up pressure on Russia]{.underline}**. In August 2017 U.S.
President Donald **[Trump signed the Countering America\'s Adversaries
Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), which aims to punish Moscow for its
malign actions]{.underline}**. Under the legislation, **[countries
trading with Russia's defense and intelligence sectors can face
secondary sanctions]{.underline}**. Rostec, a state corporation that
brings together all the major producers of defense and high-tech
products, is on the CAATSA list, which means U.S. policy changes can
have a significant impact on its exports, especially to countries that
have military-technical agreements with Russia. In this context, the
Kremlin faces more uncertainty and risks in the arms exporting business.
**[Washington has already
[imposed](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-sanctions/u-s-sanctions-china-for-buying-russian-fighter-jets-missiles-idUSKCN1M02TP)]{.underline}**
secondary **[sanctions on Beijing over its purchase of
Russian]{.underline}** Su-35 fighter **[jets]{.underline}** and S-400
systems. **[This]{.underline}** established a precedent and sent **[a
clear signal to Russian partners that the U.S. might impose sanctions on
them as well.]{.underline}** In fact, **[it puts many countries at risk,
including long-time partners of Moscow, like]{.underline}** India,
**[Egypt]{.underline}**, and Algeria, as well as those with which it has
recently begun to develop military-technical ties, such as Turkey,
Vietnam, Pakistan, Qatar, Indonesia, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.
As a result, **[changes in U.S.]{.underline}** economic and political
**[relations]{.underline}** with Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, or the
UAE, for example, **[can end up having a major impact on Russia's export
capabilities]{.underline}**. For **[example, it was unclear whether
Russia and India would manage to sign a contract on S-400 deliveries
because of U.S. pressure]{.underline}**. In the end, **[the two partners
were able to find a solution and inked a \$5.4 billion deal, but only
after India received a presidential waiver from the U.S.]{.underline}**
And just because India was able to find a solution, that doesn't mean
there won't be issues with other contracts and clients. For now Russia's
biggest deals are with Egypt (helicopters, fighter jets, coastal defense
systems, and more), Indonesia (Su-35 jets), Iraq (T-90s tanks), and
Vietnam (T-90s tanks). The Gulf Cooperation Council states are also
interested in Russian weapons, and Russia is expected to begin
delivering the S-400 system to Turkey, a NATO member, later this year.
Although the Russia-Turkey contract for the S-400 missile system has
been presented by both sides as a done deal, it still seems uncertain.
So far, Ankara hasn't listened to U.S. requests to drop the deal, and
Washington has [recently
moved](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-suspends-turkeys-participation-in-f-35-fighter-program-over-ankaras-purchase-of-russian-system/2019/04/01/c38a16be-54b6-11e9-8ef3-fbd41a2ce4d5_story.html?utm_term=.f34b5c273dc3)
to take more aggressive action, suspending Turkey's participation in the
F-35 program. It is unclear what additional steps the U.S. is prepared
to take vis-à-vis its ally, but in the end the fate of the Moscow-Ankara
deal will determine what happens with other potential partners in the
Middle East, like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar, as well as
elsewhere. The same applies to the new Russia-Egypt contract for Su-35
fighters. Egypt is among most important U.S. partners in the region and
its continuous interest in Russian arms annoys Washington. However, it
seems unlikely that the U.S. will sanction Egypt given the weak state of
its economy; such a move would also present political issues and would
undermine the position of Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. That
said, **[the U.S. has the capacity to]{.underline}** effectively
**[influence its partners' behavior and to limit Moscow's opportunities
to expand its]{.underline}** share of the **[arms market in the most
attractive regions]{.underline}**: **[The Middle East and Asia. However,
if the U.S. continues exerting pressure on its partners over
Russia,]{.underline}** **[it runs the risk of provoking increasing
opposition]{.underline}**. Moreover, it is unclear what mechanisms
Washington is going to use to implement secondary sanctions or what
incentives it could offer its partners to stop cooperating with Russia.
Otherwise, **[the U.S. will]{.underline}** need to **[act against its
partners,]{.underline}** which might end up having the opposite effect,
**[prompting them to seek closer ties with Moscow as a counter-balance
to excessive U.S. pressure.]{.underline}** Regional demand: The growing
Middle Eastern market Although Asia and Oceania remain the world's
largest arms market, accounting for 40% of total imports, countries in
the region have started to import less. By contrast, across the Middle
East, the demand for arms is only expected to grow, driven by ongoing
conflicts (such as those in Syria, Yemen, and Libya), the fragile
security situation, and the threat of military confrontation between
state and non-state actors. According to SIPRI, over the last decade the
region's arms imports grew by 75% from 20% of the global total in
2009-13 to 35% in 2014-18. Russia is not alone in looking to the Middle
East as a source of growth, however. Indeed, as the most attractive and
lucrative arms market, the Middle East attracts all the major arms
exporters and the competition is fierce. At present, Middle Eastern
countries import only 10% of their arms from Russia, while 54% comes
from the U.S. and 9% from France. Therefore, Russia's presence in the
market is quite limited, although it is growing thanks to the Kremlin's
outreach to regional arms importers. In last year's [SIPRI
report](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2018-03/fssipri_at2017_0.pdf)
Russia was not even in top three arms exporters to the region. As it
looks to ramp up its exports, **[Moscow is highly dependent on the
broader political and economic situation in the Middle East. Given the
fact that the majority of the regional actors]{.underline}** --- Saudi
Arabia, **[Egypt]{.underline}**, UAE, Qatar, Turkey, Jordan, and Kuwait
--- **[are U.S. allies and importers of American arms, Russia finds
itself in a very tricky situation.]{.underline}** European exporters are
also ramping up their regional presence. In recent years, the leaders of
the European arms industry --- France, Germany, the UK, and Italy ---
increased their share of the global arms market by boosting their
exports to the Middle East. France is the major Russian competitor in
Egypt, which imports 37% of its arms from France against 30% from
Russia. In this sense, Egypt plays both sides, trying to diversify its
suppliers: In 2015 Cairo signed a deal with Moscow for 50 Russian MiG-29
fighters as well as with Paris for 24
[Rafale](https://timep.org/reports-briefings/timep-briefs/european-arms-sales-to-egypt/)
jets. Algeria, a long-time major customer, imported 66% of its arms from
Russia in 2014-18, although imports from Germany account for 10% of its
total as well. The current political turmoil in Algeria might well
result in a change in Russia's market share and a shift in favor of
European producers. The UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey --- where
Russia is currently seeking new contracts --- also import a significant
share of their arms from the U.S. and European suppliers. Therefore,
**[Russia's position in the regional and global arms market is getting
more complicated and difficult given Moscow's declining share of total
exports]{.underline}**, decreasing imports in Asia and Oceania, **[and
rising competition in the Middle East.]{.underline}** In addition,
**[growing U.S. pressure on Russia via its secondary sanctions puts
Moscow in a very challenging situation that will make it harder to sign
big new contracts and increase its arms exports. Despite all of these
difficulties Moscow is working hard to get new deals]{.underline}**,
both **[in the Middle East]{.underline}** --- the world's
fastest-growing and the most attractive arms market --- and elsewhere,
as part of a broader effort to maintain its status as a leading arms
supplier. However, **[given the geopolitical headwinds and intense
competition, maintaining that status looks like it will be an increasing
challenge in the years ahead.]{.underline}**

#### Previous suspensions on arms sales prove Egypt will try to diversify if the US blocks sales

Research Service. (Clayton, 10/11/17, "Arms Sales in the Middle East:
Trends and Analytical Perspectives for U.S. Policy,"

**[From 2008 to 2011]{.underline}**, fully **[76% of Egyptian arms
acquisitions came from the United States; that figure dropped to 49%
from 2012 to 2015, as Western European]{.underline}** (**[30%) and
Russian (13%) suppliers stepped in to fill the gap.]{.underline}** Most
of **[Egypt's military assets]{.underline}** (including both its air
fleet and many of its tanks) **[are divided between higher-end American
equipment and older Eastern European systems. A]{.underline}**lthough
diversification may lessen Egypt's dependence on any one supplier to
some extent, it also raises the level of complexity Egypt faces in
maintaining diverse weapons systems and juggling multiple supplier
relationships. Some specific **[recent transactions
illustrate]{.underline}** apparent **[Egyptian attempts to diversify in
the aftermath of the Obama Administration's reaction to the 2013
military intervention]{.underline}**. **[In]{.underline}** February
**[2014, Egypt signed a \$3 billion weapons deal with
Russia]{.underline}**. **[Two months later, the United States went
through with a sale of Apache helicopters that had been frozen because
of the 2013 military intervention]{.underline}** and its aftermath,
**[although the Obama Administration continued to withhold delivery of
more than a dozen F-16s. That delay ended in March 2015, and the F-16s
arrived in Egypt]{.underline}** in November of that year. Meanwhile,
**[Egypt has strengthened its relationship with European suppliers,
especially France]{.underline}**, despite European uneasiness regarding
Sisi's post-2013 crackdown against dissent. **[Egypt and France
concluded a \$5.2 billion deal]{.underline}** for 24 Rafale fighter jets
in February 2015, and seven months later, Egypt agreed to buy two
Mistral helicopter carriers for more than \$1 billion.42 The two
countries signed another agreement, worth more than \$1 billion, in
April 2016 for additional ships, fighter jets, and a military satellite
communication system.43

aims. My advice would be to take the possibility of Russia's flipping
Egypt seriously, not to dismiss what's happening as mere posturing.

#### There is only a possibility Russia will increase ties with Egypt if the US ends relations -- increased military cooperation has already started

In August 2017, American and Egyptian forces resumed Operation Bright
Star after an eight-year hiatus due to both the Arab Spring and the
former President Barack Obama's ire at Egyptian human-rights abuses.
That Operation is a biennial military exercise intended to showcase both
the political alliance between Washington and Cairo and their two
military's tight relations. **[The most recent operation capped a new
honeymoon in U.S.-Egypt ties that began with President Trump\'s election
and continued with a state visit in Washington and the release of
long-imprisoned American aid worker]{.underline}** Aya Hijazi. But,
**[will warm U.S.-Egypt ties persist?]{.underline}** And, if they sour
against the backdrop of Congressional human-rights sanctions and simple
neglect, could Russia be poised to flip Egypt? **[While perhaps
unimaginable to diplomats who, for a generation, have taken Egypt's
Western orientation for granted, the answer is unfortunately
yes.]{.underline}** Throughout the Cold War, Egypt was a prize, too
important to cast aside. For instance, President Eisenhower stood up not
only to Israel but also North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies France
and Great Britain after they invaded Egypt to reverse Egyptian president
Gamal Abdul Nasser's nationalization of the Suez Canal. But Egypt
nevertheless moved into the Soviet orbit, training Egyptian pilots in
Russia and ultimately culminating in a Treaty of Friendship under
Nasser's successor Anwar Sadat. But deft American diplomacy managed to
flip Egypt back into America's camp where, especially after the Camp
David peace accords between Israel and Egypt, it has remained a
cornerstone of American regional security policy.
![](media/image1.bin){width="1.3888888888888888e-2in"
height="1.3888888888888888e-2in"} As Russian President Vladimir **[Putin
seeks to dislodge American influence in the Middle East and raise
Russia's great power status, Cairo is increasingly in Moscow's
crosshairs]{.underline}**. For example, **[Putin has agreed to resume
Russian flights to Egypt that were suspended the same year after a
terrorist attack downed a Russian charter flight]{.underline}** killing
over two hundred Russian tourists onboard. This move comes at the same
time as the American Senate Appropriations Committee holds up \$300
million in aid until Egypt compensates an American injured when the
Egyptian military fired on a group of tourists near the Libyan border.
This matters because **[the]{.underline}** **[Egyptian economy is
heavily dependent on tourism and]{.underline}** because **[Russia has
been the single most significant source of tourists to Egypt for
years]{.underline}**. In 2010, for example, prior to the Arab Spring,
tourism brought [nearly \$13
billion](https://mail.aei.org/owa/redir.aspx?C=Wx5SAMJS9Rky5XG278wfmNV_WIo-__3qMPWhFOX0b-ONerzwl8TVCA..&URL=https%3a%2f%2fwww.nytimes.com%2f2011%2f11%2f06%2ftravel%2ftourism-in-egypt.html)
to the Egyptian economy. Also, official calculations do not capture the
myriad indirect benefits, including cash tourists, spend on the streets,
all of which has a significant positive impact on Egyptian households.
The return of Russian tourists also helps Egypt\'s current leader, Abdel
Fattah el-Sisi, resist stringent International Monetary Fund demands for
Egyptian reform. Additionally, for Moscow, economic partnerships have
ulterior motives. For example, a May 23 agreement to establish an
industrial trade zone in Port Said puts Russian political interests
astride the Suez Canal. Furthermore, **[Putin is cultivating
Egypt]{.underline}** in other ways. In December 2017, **[Putin and Sisi
agreed on a \$30 billion deal for Russia to build a nuclear power plant
for Egypt.]{.underline}** It should be noted that construction is
scheduled to begin by the tenth anniversary of Obama's decision to scrap
a U.S.-Egyptian nuclear partnership that began during the George W. Bush
administration. Besides, **[Cairo increasingly looks to Moscow for
military cooperation and weaponry for which,]{.underline}** rightly or
wrongly, **[the Egyptian military is desperate for as it fights an
Islamic State-affiliated insurgency]{.underline}** in the northern Sinai
Peninsula. Whereas **[the U.S. Congress often holds up arms deliveries
due to human-rights concerns, Russia has no such qualms]{.underline}**.
**[Nor does Putin forbid secondary sales, something Egypt seeks as it
works to prop up proxies in the ongoing Libyan conflict]{.underline}**.
Finally, **[the two countries have held joint naval drills and broader
military exercises and,]{.underline}** in March 2017, **[Moscow deployed
Special Forces to help Egypt on the Libyan border]{.underline}**.
Against this backdrop, Cairo's acceptance of Moscow's position in Syria
should not surprise anyone, nor its [recent
decision](http://tass.ru/politika/5198786) to decline United States
requests to send Egyptian troops to Syria.

As Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi begins his second term, a new
chapter in Egyptian-Russian relations is being written. **[Disappointed
by U.S. policy, Cairo has strengthened its ties with Moscow. The new
trajectory stems in part from the lack of robust American engagement,
which has left an open door for Russia to make inroads at Washington's
expense. Last month, Egypt and Russia signed a 50-year agreement in
Moscow to establish a Russian Industrial Zone]{.underline}** (RIZ) in
the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZone), an ambitious economic development
project initially launched by al-Sisi in 2014. Egypt hopes that the RIZ
project, signed during the 11th meeting of the joint Egyptian-Russian
commission, will attract up to \$70 billion in investments and create
35,000 jobs. The Russians plan to use the RIZ to manufacture a vast
array of goods including heavy trucks and engines. **[For Moscow, which
faces continued U.S. and EU sanctions, the project would provide an
access point for exporting goods to overseas markets---especially to the
Middle East, Africa, and Latin America.]{.underline}** The RIZ is not
the first sign of deepening ties between Russia and Egypt. In his second
visit to Cairo since Abdel Fattah al-Sisi came to power this past
December, Russian President Vladimir Putin presided over the signing of
a nuclear power plant deal that includes a \$25 billion loan from
Moscow. The Dabaa nuclear plant, with four reactors and a capacity of
five gigawatts, is scheduled for completion by 2029, according to
Russia's state-owned nuclear operator Rosatom. In April, Moscow also
resumed civilian flights to Egypt after an Islamic State affiliate
bombed a Russian Metrojet flight in 2015, killing 224 people. The flow
of Russian tourists to Egypt had subsequently stopped, damaging Egypt's
struggling tourism industry. Direct flights from Russia to Egypt's main
tourist resorts---Hurghada and Sharm el-Sheikh---have yet to resume.
However, after talks on May 14 with his Egyptian counterpart Sameh
Shoukry, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that continuing
close cooperation with Egypt on security issues was hastening the
resumption of direct air link to the Red Sea resorts. **[These specific
developments reflect the general warming trend in a relationship between
Cairo and Moscow that has deepened over the past few
years.]{.underline}** Egyptian exports to Russia rose by some 26 percent
in 2017, reaching a record \$3.8 billion, and the Russia-Egyptian
Business Council claims bilateral trade could increase from \$6 billion
to \$10 billion in 2018. In the energy sector, Russian oil giant Rosneft
bought a 30-percent stake in Egypt's Zohr gas field for \$1.125 billion
last year, becoming a key player in developing one of the largest gas
deposits in the Mediterranean Sea. Further, Rosneft and Fleet Energy
signed a framework agreement in late May to explore a joint venture for
providing gas supplies to Egypt. **[Since 2014, Egypt has been
increasingly turning to Russia for arms sales. The decision to do so was
initially triggered by al-Sisi's disappointment with Washington after
the 2013 removal of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi's
regime.]{.underline}** **[When the Obama Administration halted the
delivery of previously contracted weapons systems including F-16 fighter
jets and AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, and canceled joint military
exercises between Egyptian and American armed forces, al-Sisi and Putin
started to talk.]{.underline}** And the disappointment did not end with
Obama's term in office. Despite apparently warm personal relations
between al-Sisi and President Donald Trump, in August 2017 the Trump
Administration decided to condition economic and military aid over
Cairo's track record towards human rights, democracy, and rule of law.
With all that as a backdrop, **[Russia has stepped up to fill the void,
with several arms deals worth billions of dollars]{.underline}** signed
during al-Sisi's presidency. 50 MiG-29 fighter jets were purchased in
2014 and delivery started late last year. Egypt also purchased 46 of a
naval version of the Kamov Ka-52 Alligator helicopter, intended for the
two French Mistral helicopter carriers that Cairo bought from Paris in
September 2015. (France originally built the two ships for Russia, but
canceled the sale after Moscow's invasion and annexation of Crimea.)
**[The military developments go beyond arms sales, with strategic
cooperation increasing as well]{.underline}**. In November 2017, the two
countries inked an agreement during a visit by the Russian Defense
Minister to Cairo that allows for the **[joint use of each other's
airspace and military airbases.]{.underline}** The five-year deal, which
could be extended further if both parties agree, has raised eyebrows in
Washington. If implemented**[, it would reinforce Russia's military
presence in the Middle East and create a potential launching pad for
wider Russian operations in North Africa.]{.underline}** The countries'
militaries have also held several joint exercises in that time period.
In 2015, Russia and Egypt held joint naval drills off the Mediterranean
Egyptian port of Alexandria. **[In 2016, Egyptian and Russian
paratroopers participated in a joint military exercise titled "Defenders
of Friendship," the first of its kind in Africa, which was followed by a
similar exercise in Russia in 2017]{.underline}**. **[Egypt will again
host Russian and Egyptian paratroopers in 2018, according to the Russian
Ministry of Defense]{.underline}**. And finally, **[Egypt and Russia
increasingly share common views on regional issues. On Syria, both
countries have been calling for preserving the country's territorial
integrity and its national army]{.underline}**. In October 2017, the two
countries brokered a ceasefire deal in southern Damascus. In Libya, the
two countries support the Libyan National Army, which is led by Khalifa
Haftar, the military commander who dominates eastern Libya. In addition,
the airspace deal with Egypt could bring Russia closer to Libya and
raise the likelihood of greater Russian military involvement there. With
the election of President Donald Trump, al-Sisi hoped for better
relations with Washington to maintain stability and address the
country's economic challenges. Clearly this has not yet materialized. On
the one hand, visible warming of ties with a geopolitical rival of the
United States is a game that Egypt is well versed in. The Trump
Administration should proceed carefully and unemotionally. **[But given
the deteriorating situation in the broader Middle East and Russia's rush
to capitalize on it to cement itself as a stakeholder in the region,
there is no excuse for the United States passively sitting on the
sidelines.]{.underline}** The Trump Administration should ramp up
engagement with the Egyptians to address lingering concerns and try to
move the relationship forward where possible. The Senate should take up
the nomination of David Schenker as Assistant Secretary of State for
Near Eastern Affairs, and the Trump Administration ought to nominate a
U.S. Ambassador to Egypt as soon as possible. Without diplomatic talent
on the ground, Washington risks ceding hard-won influence in the region
without putting up the slightest resistance.

While **[Moscow's Syria intervention]{.underline}** **[has captured much

**[Putin's vision in the region always spanned beyond Syria
alone]{.underline}**. Since coming to power, **[Putin prioritized
restoration of Russia's image as a great power.]{.underline}** This goal
entailed, among others, **[a return to regions where Moscow used to be a
key player.]{.underline}** The Middle East and **[North
Africa]{.underline}** are both **[at the top of Russia's foreign policy
agenda]{.underline}**. That Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov's
most recent trip to the Maghreb in January
[focused](http://tass.com/politics/1041391) among other issues on "the
settlement of the problems existing in the Middle East and North Africa,
as well as the Sahara-Sahel region" shows the importance Moscow places
on its own peacemaking role. North Africa is increasingly part of these
revived efforts in recent years. The fact that the [Arab
Spring](http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Opinion/Commentary/2011/Oct-21/151842-vladimir-fear-the-arab-springs-message.ashx)
originated in this region is one critical aspect towards regional
strategy for Moscow. For policy makers in Moscow these events mattered
for two reasons: First, Moscow saw them as a continuation of what it
perceives as US-sponsored regime change, an extension of colour
revolutions that occurred primarily in the post-Soviet space in the
mid-2000s. For Moscow this trend also touched the Middle East, notably
with Lebanon's Cedar Revolution. It appears that Russia does not believe
it's possible for people to rise up against their ruler on their own,
without US backing. In this vein, Putin accused the US of
[sponsoring](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/08/vladimir-putin-hillary-clinton-russia)
protests against himself in late 2011-early 2012. Second, these events
caused Putin to temporarily lose the influence he laboured to gain with
the now-overthrown regimes. But beyond the Arab Spring, Moscow had
political, economic, and geostrategic interests in this region. In
recent years [Moscow's
influence](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/russia-makes-inroads-in-north-africa)
has grown in the region, especially in Egypt, Libya and Algeria, and to
a lesser extent in Morocco and Tunisia. Moscow's view of the region
**[Moscow covets access to the Mediterranean, and allies in North Africa
offer just that. Moscow has attempted to gain naval
access]{.underline}** since the time of Catherine the Great, who
believed the Mediterranean was a crucial component of making Russia a
great power. In this sense, the Kremlin's aspirations remain relatively
unchanged to this day. **[Moscow believes that access to the
Mediterranean could turn Russia into a key player in the European sphere
of influence and would also reduce US ability to maneuver militarily.
This follows a pattern that could already be observed in the Black Sea
and the Caspian Sea where Moscow is vying for influence.]{.underline}**
Moscow has positioned its military hardware in Syria in an attempt to
create an Anti-Area Access denial (A2AD) which partially succeeded.
**[Moscow's military position complicates US ability to maneuver.
Greater influence in North Africa can help further this goal by
providing additional port access along the Mediterranean and thus
extending an A2AD perimetre from air into water. The ultimate aim of
A2AD bubbles is to deny freedom of action, in other words: to deter --
and Moscow is working towards this aim in the region]{.underline}**.
**[Economically, Moscow is vying for the role of an]{.underline}**
**[[arms exporter of
choice](https://jamestown.org/program/tactical-side-russias-arms-sales-middle-east/)
for the entire MENA region]{.underline}**. The region is already the
[second largest purchaser of Russia's
arms](http://www.businessinsider.com/us-russia-global-arms-sales-2016-12.),
while Russia remains the world's top arms exporter after the US. Beyond
arms, **[the region offers opportunities for partnerships]{.underline}**
in the energy sector and investments in infrastructure development.
Meanwhile, Moscow justifies its presence in the region as it claims to
continue the fight against terrorism there, and the need to solidify
partnerships with regional allies. In addition, North Africa also offers
a springboard deeper south into sub-Saharan Africa, where Moscow has
been [increasingly
active](https://www.ft.com/content/a5648efa-1a4e-11e9-9e64-d150b3105d21)
in the last three years for economic and political reasons. This trend
is unlikely to abate any time soon. Finally, **[American retreat from
the region]{.underline}** that began under the Obama administration and
continues under the Trump administration has created a vacuum that has
**[made it easier for Putin to step in and assert his own
influence---opportunities he would not have had in a context of a
stronger American presence.]{.underline}** Moscow, unlike the US,
attaches no preconditions on its diplomacy. These preconditions, such as
improvement of human rights, or prohibition of secondary arms sales,
tend to also play into the preferences of regional rulers. Egypt and
Libya Since the Camp David accords, **[Egypt has been the cornerstone of
American regional security policy.]{.underline}** But also **[Russia has
cultivated ties with Egypt in multiple ways in recent
years]{.underline}**: We have seen new bilateral ties in the political,
military and economic spheres, **[taking advantage of Egypt's
deteriorating relations with the Obama administration]{.underline}**.
Meanwhile, Cairo appears [genuinely
interested](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/could-russia-flip-egypt-26367)
in diversifying away from the US and policy makers shouldn't discount
the possibility of a pivot towards Russia. Bilateral trade continues to
grow, and the recent completion of an economic industrial zone further
plays on Moscow's political interests in Egypt. The two countries signed
an agreement for Moscow to build Egypt's first nuclear power plant, held
joint naval drills and broader military exercises, and Egypt
increasingly depends on Russian weapon imports to supply its military
and defense apparatus. In this context, Egypt has come to accept
Moscow's position on Syrian President Assad, and last year
[declined](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/could-russia-flip-egypt-26367)

towards cooperation with Khalifa Haftar, the head of the Libyan National
Army who controls Libya's oil-rich east. But, Putin has also built
strong ties with the Serraj government as part of Putin's 'friends with
everyone' approach to the region. Meanwhile, the US [remains largely
absent](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/after-palermo-achievements-and-future-challenges-for-libya)

in February this year that Moscow seeks economic and military contracts
and to gain access to the Mediterranean coast. The latter would provide
Russia greater access to Europe's southern border---critical for
leveraging the issue of refugees over Europe.
[According](https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-migration/proposal-implementation-package/docs/20170125_migration_on_the_central_mediterranean_route_-_managing_flows_saving_lives_en.pdf)
to European Commission, Libya "represents the departure point for 90% of
those seeking to travel to Europe." Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia Algeria
has long remained in Moscow's camp of closer regional allies. Since
2001, the two countries cooperated primarily in the military sector. In
2006 Putin cancelled a \$4.7 Soviet-era debt to Moscow and signed a
\$7.5 billion arms deal that included a military modernization and
training program. Over the years Moscow's arms sales and military
equipment to Algeria continued and in 2016 military cooperation expanded
to sharing intelligence on terrorist groups in North Africa. Traditional
US allies Tunisia and Morocco have edged closer to Moscow in recent
years. In Tunisia, Moscow' s influence is especially visible in the
tourism industry which is vital to the country's economy, and has slowly
rebounded after the 2015 Sousse attacks in which 38 foreign tourists
were killed. Indeed, it is very common to hear Tunisian shop keepers
speak Russian to customers. In 2016, Morocco's King Mohammed VI came to
Moscow for the first time since 2002, and signed agreements on improving
economic relations. Most recently, Moscow [began
support](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20171012-russia-and-morocco-sign-agreements-to-inaugurate-military-and-security-cooperation/)
for Morocco's nuclear energy programme. Rabat's policy may be linked to
Moroccan frustration with the perceived sympathy from both the Obama and
Trump administration toward the Polisario Front and their lack of
enthusiasm for Morocco's position on the Western Sahara conflict. That
the Polisario Front was a Soviet Cold War proxy is ironic, but has not
been an insurmountable obstacle in Moscow's outreach to Rabat. Political
and Security Risk Libya remains the primary candidate for Moscow's next
strategic move in North Africa. The country itself encapsulates many of
Moscow's foreign policy priorities: access to oil and arms markets,
access to the Mediterranean and additional leverage over Europe through
controlling the tap of refugee flows. US absence creates a vacuum for
Moscow to assert its influence unchallenged. Moreover,
**[Egypt]{.underline}** and Libya are **[strategically vital because
they provide access to the entire region. It is the perfect gateway to
gain leverage over Europe and a springboard deeper into
Africa]{.underline}** and Moscow already wields much influence in
Egypt---a trend that is unlikely to decline. After Egypt and Libya,
Moscow's influence in Morocco, most important US regional ally after
Egypt, is also worrisome. Oleg Ozerov, Russian Foreign Affairs
ministry's deputy director for Africa and ambassador to Saudi Arabia
[noted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzCZpSPmvzE) recently that
**[African countries requested Russian assistance after observing
Russia's "success in counterterrorism operations in Syria." His comment
shows the far reaching implications of Moscow's Syrian operations. The
political risk of Moscow's growing influence is the continued loss of
American, and more broadly, Western credibility in]{.underline}** the
Middle East and **[North Africa]{.underline}** that becomes Russia's
gain. The security risk for the region is ultimately Moscow's inability
and lack of desire to bring genuine security and conflict resolution to
the MENA region. Moscow talks about peace and stability but benefits
from low-level conflict. Through building relationships with all parties
it aims to emerge as the ultimate arbiter as it manages, rather than
resolves conflict, and sells arms to all sides. **[Russia's growing
influence in North Africa creates]{.underline}**
**[political]{.underline}** and security **[risks for Europe, over whom
Russia is poised to gain greater leverage]{.underline}**. It also
further opens doors for Russia's influence in the Middle East, and
expansion into Africa, while Moscow's cynicism will reinforce
anti-democratic trends rather than encourage reform. On a broader scale,
these trends bode greater disunity among Western allies that can only
complicate worldwide efforts to effectively counter Russia's activities.

#### Russian influence in North Africa weakens US and European strength

np

Perhaps Russian President Vladimir Putin is a student of history, or
maybe he likes maps, but whatever his hobby, he seems to understand
geography quite well. The **[character of Moscow's influence differs
greatly from the old Soviet days]{.underline}** when it was collecting
client states (except for Russia's ongoing deployment of force in
Syria). But **[it has been effective]{.underline}**---or effective
enough---**[in drawing important allies away from the United States
while presenting Russia as a competent, nonideological partner that
shares interests with the regional players]{.underline}**. **[Therein
lies the]{.underline}** central **[logic to Russia's Middle East-Europe
strategy: establish influence at Washington's expense, weakening the
U.S. position in the region, and in the process apply pressure on Europe
via its weak underbelly---in this case to the south and southeast of the
European Union.]{.underline}** Draw a line on a map from Moscow to
Damascus and from the Syrian capital to Erbil in the Kurdistan region of
Iraq. Everyone knows what happened in Syria: The Russians entered the
conflict there to save an ally and have helped him prosecute a war that
has produced millions of refugees, many of whom have made their way to
Europe and left others banging on its gates. The effects on European
politics have been profound, galvanizing a populist, nativist, and
pro-Russian right at the expense of Europe's postwar liberal consensus.
While Syria is a well-known story, only a few in Washington seem to have
noticed that since 2017, Russia has reportedly invested \$4 billion in
the Kurdish oil and gas sector. From Erbil extends the line of Russian
influence and power to the east from Iraqi Kurdistan to Iran. That
Moscow-Damascus-Erbil-Tehran line represents an important axis of
Russian influence. But other Russia-dominated geographic lines are even
more relevant for Europe. One line starts in the Russian capital and
proceeds due south to the Turkish capital, Ankara. Moscow has not
exactly turned Turkey, but the combination of Syria, where Putin is the
powerbroker; Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's worldview; and the
still changing nature of international politics after the Cold War, has
made a Turkey-Russia partnership of sorts possible. The Turks are
scheduled to receive Russia's advanced S-400 air defense system in July
2019, Turkey's volume of trade with Russia is bigger than with the
United States, and Erdogan recently identified Moscow---along with
Beijing and Tehran---as an alternative to Washington. All of this has
stoked (mostly overblown) fears within the Washington policy community
about "losing Turkey," but for the Europeans who are connected to Ankara
through the flow of goods and services and who regard Anatolia as a
buffer between them and Moscow, burgeoning Turkey-Russia ties are a
problem. Start again, but this time cross the Mediterranean and stop at
Cairo, make a sharp left and extend the line to Benghazi. That is the
third axis. **[The Russians]{.underline}**, with their uncompromising
position regarding the threat of Islamism, **[offer high-tech
weaponry]{.underline}**---and a no-questions-asked policy on human
rights---**[and for Egypt's leaders that's an appealing alternative to
the United States. Egypt has been a critical component of the existing
regional political order, which has favored the exercise of U.S. power
in the Middle East for at least three decades.]{.underline}** Rather
than reversing Henry Kissinger's 1970s-era Westward flip of the
Egyptians, **[Moscow has pushed and pulled in places where Americans and
Egyptians have been at loggerheads.]{.underline}** This can't make
European leaders very comfortable. **[About 10 percent of world
trade]{.underline}**---much of it going to and from Europe---**[passes
through the Suez Canal. Egypt's ties to Russia also raise the prospect
that for the first time in a long time, U.S. and European navies may not
be able to operate totally unimpeded in the Eastern
Mediterranean.]{.underline}**

the long term it is rather difficult to assess developments but
naturally, the EU and the US will search for ways to become more visible
and enhance their credibility in the region, countering the Russian
influence. The extent of cooperation between Russia and the North
African countries In the context of the uncertainty of the relations
with the US (a traditional long-standing ally), it is clear the need for
Morocco to search to strengthen ties with other international powers and
explore every option available. Proof of this is the king's visits to
China and Russia, in spring 2016, in order to deepen strategic ties.
Russia developed relations with Morocco on two directions, namely
economic and security & defense. Once again, Russia is seizing the
opportunity to fill a gap and extend its influence by being ready to
supply Morocco with [military
equipment](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://m.le360.ma/politique/exclusif-le-maroc-interesse-par-lacquisition-du-systeme-de-missiles-sol-air-russe-s-400-138449&sa=D&ust=1520428674382000&usg=AFQjCNHhVxf0_hikgVE7-uVrkWewWcJPaQ)
and expand economic ties (growing foreign investments, trade and
expanding tourism opportunities -- Morocco seems very appealing for
Russian tourists). I would argue that in the case of Morocco, Russia is
looking to establish itself as a strategic partner in multiple areas.
[The recent
visit](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://northafricapost.com/20126-morocco-russia-set-deepen-strategic-partnership.html&sa=D&ust=1520428674383000&usg=AFQjCNFP4tBlNFKeVwG6pygKx36uSdeihQ)
of the Russian Prime Minister in October 2017 confirms this, its scope
being to explore new dimensions for furthering this partnership, the
economic area being the most feasible way to do so (with emphasis on
agriculture, trade, energy, tourism etc.) while also exploring
cooperation in the military sphere. The Russian Prime Minister's tour
also included Algeria,
[highlights](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://afrique.lepoint.fr/economie/dmitri-medvedev-a-alger-moscou-retrouve-le-chemin-du-maghreb-10-10-2017-2163406_2258.php&sa=D&ust=1520428674384000&usg=AFQjCNFBSU8s45mnYaPwoUvdS_1RjkZEsg)
of the visit being discussions to further deliver military equipment
(aircrafts and air defense systems) and to establish factories of
Russian companies that make trucks, bulldozers etc. The Russians are
looking to extend the economic cooperation and maintain Algeria as an
important weapons buyer. Russia is the largest supplier of military
equipment to Algeria and according to the data gathered by
[SIPRI](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://armstrade.sipri.org/armstrade/page/values.php&sa=D&ust=1520428674384000&usg=AFQjCNGMnOl6QH58GgyOwJ_GNIGc9hqjsw),
every year from 1999 to 2016 Algeria has signed deals to buy significant
weaponry from Russia (a few examples in this sense are the acquisitions
of multi-role fighters
[Su-30MKI(A)](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://defence-blog.com/news/algeria-receives-eight-su-30mkia-multirole-fighters-from-russia.html&sa=D&ust=1520428674385000&usg=AFQjCNFSkL_1E7CO2ndV_R95ATdgQCmUAg)
and [Mi-28 attack
helicopters](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKCN0WK0MR&sa=D&ust=1520428674385000&usg=AFQjCNFoUkwidiv6rP2uoM2iQJlZwUo6ow)).
Another point worth mentioning in the case of Algeria-Russia relations
is that the Russian government agreed to erase the debt owed to the
former Soviet Union and in exchange Algeria purchased Russian goods in
the amount of the disregarded debt. This has been a practice in multiple
cases in Africa. Cooperation in the energy field is very important,
Russian companies being very involved in Algeria -- Gazprom and
Sonatrach explored together the El Assel block and found oil and gas
reserves with further exploration currently underway (Gazprom owns 49%
of the project). Nuclear energy cooperation is also on top of the
cooperation agenda between Russia and Algeria, the countries having
signed an
[agreement](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NP-Talks-on-Algerian-nuclear-power-aspirations-begin-soon-29021602.html&sa=D&ust=1520428674386000&usg=AFQjCNEnL4gaJ1qiD7Kmn39b5P4dXOGFrQ)
to cooperate in 2014 and being currently in discussions to build
Algeria's first nuclear power plant. The
[deal](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NP-Russia-extends-ties-with-Cuba-Finland-Jordan-and-Tunisia-28091601.html&sa=D&ust=1520428674387000&usg=AFQjCNHhl2JeM0YimltcgReIH_mwexhlhQ)
concerning the nuclear energy area signed in 2016 with Tunisia is also
relevant and involves cooperation in research and development of nuclear
infrastructure including reactors and power plants. Furthermore, the
rise of the Russian tourism in Tunisia in the past years is very
important in the overall relations between the two countries. On
military cooperation, it is noticeable the intention of the Russians to
supply Tunisia with [military
equipment](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.defensenews.com/global/mideast-africa/2016/03/24/russia-promises-helicopters-gear-for-tunisia-s-anti-terrorism-fight/&sa=D&ust=1520428674387000&usg=AFQjCNGEKmrx7fDCquDtX8YljZwk8ghQ5A)
(helicopters, bullet-proof vests and night-vision goggles) with the aim
of supporting Tunisian forces in the fight against terrorism. Russia
goes the extra mile and brands itself as an important partner in
fighting terrorism in the region by being ready to support with military
equipment, sharing intelligence and expertise. In the context of
worsening relations with the US and rather stranded ones with the EU,
Egypt has moved closer to Russia in the recent years. The August 2017
visit of Egyptian Prime Minister to Russia and the meeting between Putin
and Sisi in China at the BRICS summit in September are just the most
recent examples of the strengthened relations between the two countries.
**[The military equipment]{.underline}** [**[package

a partnership between Rosatom and the Egyptian authorities, has been
finalized during the September meeting with a very good financial scheme
in place (a loan offered by the Russians that will cover 85% of the
costs). The **[relationship between the two countries is also important
from a political standpoint, through the lens of regional issues where
the two actors have common interests and support or can support each
other]{.underline}** such as in the case of Libya. Amidst the crisis in

have been opened to boost economic cooperation, for example development
of a Russian industrial zone in Egypt. When analyzing the level of the
partnership between Russia and Egypt, we also need to see the bigger
picture in terms of the acquisition of military equipment -- Egypt is
currently buying from [multiple

(French aircrafts, Mistral ships and German submarines) which means that
the Egyptian government is looking to diversify and meet its military
needs and not necessarily that Russia is seen as a special partner in
this area. Prospects for Russia's engagement in the region **[While

that hovers around 80 percent. **[Putinomics made it possible for
Russia]{.underline}**\'s president **[to survive repeated financial and
political shocks]{.underline}**. How did he do it? Russia survived the
twin challenges of the oil price crash and Western sanctions thanks to a
three-pronged economic strategy. First, **[it focused on macroeconomic
stability]{.underline}**\--keeping debt levels and inflation low\--above
all else. Second, it **[prevented popular discontent by guaranteeing low
unemployment and steady pensions,]{.underline}** even at the expense of

improve efficiency,]{.underline}** but only where it did not conflict
with political goals. **[This strategy]{.underline}** will not make
Russia rich, but it **[has kept the country stable]{.underline}** and
kept the ruling elite in power. That said, does Putin really have an
economic strategy? **[A common explanation of Putin\'s longevity is that
he survives because Russia\'s oil revenues keeps the country
afloat]{.underline}**; Russia\'s economy is known more for corruption
than for capable economic management. But the Kremlin could have adopted
different economic policies\--and some of the alternatives would have
made it harder for Putin to sustain his hold on power. They might also
have left Russians worse off. Consider what Russia looked like in 1999
when Putin first became president: a middle-income country in which oil
rents constituted a sizeable share of GDP. A country led by a young
lieutenant colonel committed to using the security services to bolster
his power. A president who claimed the mantle of democratic legitimacy
in part based on his ability to force big business and oligarchs to
follow his rules, whether by means fair or foul. This could well
describe Chavista Venezuela, still governed by an autocratic regime,
still dependent on declining oil revenues, and still failing to build an
economy based on rules rather than political whim. The difference is
that the Chavistas spent recklessly during the oil boom while presiding
over a mismanagement-induced collapse in oil production and, now,
painful shortages of consumer goods created by poorly conceived price
controls. According to World Bank estimates, Venezuela was wealthier on
a per person basis than Russia in 1999. No longer.

#### Alt causes to Russia's defense industry

platform and publisher founded in 1996, 05/02/2019, "Russia's Defense
Industry Finds Itself in a Tailspin"

Peter

**[Russia\'s defense industry is face to face with a major
foe]{.underline}**, but it\'s not a foreign military power. The
**[Kremlin has been striving to modernize all branches of the Russian
military, but the country\'s defense industry is struggling thanks to
decreasing volumes of orders, difficulties in attracting high-skilled
talent and limits to its technological capabilities. According to recent
figures, the performance of Russia\'s aerospace sector is declining
precipitously]{.underline}**. In 2018, for instance, Russian aircraft
and spacecraft makers produced 13.5 percent less than in 2017. And
there\'s been **[no letup in 2019 either: In the first two months of the
year, aerospace output plummeted 48 percent year on year. The decline in
Russia\'s defense output raises concerns about the competitive strength
of Russia\'s defense industry in general]{.underline}**, whose health is
critical if the country is to project itself as a military power in the
longer term. **[Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov attributed
the reduction in output to a slowdown of orders for military systems,
but projections suggest the slowdown is not just a short-term
fluctuation; in fact, it\'s expected to become even worse in the future.
The downturn in oil prices has taken a bite out of Russia\'s bottom
line, squeezing spending for the military]{.underline}** --- all at a
time when the country\'s arms manufacturers have lost their competitive
edge in the global arms market. Together, these factors ensure that
Russia\'s defense industry will struggle to get out of its funk. This
dire picture stands in stark contrast to Russia\'s frequent presentation
of sensational new platforms. In reality, however, just a few of the
big-ticket weapon systems --- such as the T-14 main battle tank or the
Su-57 fighter aircraft --- find buyers, as the rest remain mere
prototypes. Russia has prioritized some hardware, such as the Sarmat
intercontinental ballistic missile, due to their strategic relevance to
the country\'s overall military posture, but **[Moscow has failed to
fully develop other programs or only introduced them on a limited scale.

such as the Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, due to their
strategic relevance to the country\'s overall military posture, but
Moscow has failed to fully develop other programs or only introduced
them on a limited scale. But the Kremlin\'s problems don\'t end there.
In the past**[, Russia has benefited from its position as a major global
arms exporter to fuel further military development.]{.underline}**
During the 1990s, for example, such sales were critical to the country
as it faced severe economic hardship. **[While Russia remains the
world\'s second-largest arms exporter (only the United States sells
more), the actual value of those exports has been decreasing
significantly. Between 2014 and 2018, their total value dropped by as
much as 17 percent]{.underline}**. Again, budgetary limits are somewhat
to blame: In the past, Russia frequently used arms exports as a
political tool, offering weapons at a heavy discount, if not entirely
free. But with Russia no longer able to offer customers a good deal on
its fighter jets and other defense products, the country is losing
business. And Russia\'s arms industry faces an even greater problem in
the years to come: reduced competitiveness. Russia has long dominated
some of the market by offering affordable military equipment without
attaching any conditions regarding human rights, but the rise of
China\'s military industry, as well as several smaller producers around
the world, has made it much more difficult to compete for contracts.
Ultimately, the loss of export opportunities not only complicates
Russia\'s efforts to finance its defense industry, it also reduces the
scale at which the defense industry produces, which, in turn, decreases
scale-dependent savings that accompany higher levels of production. In
effect, this means that the more Russia fails to find foreign customers
for specific weapon systems, the more it will become burdened with a
higher relative cost per unit as it seeks to meet its own needs. The
conundrum, in turn, will further limit Russia\'s ability to
competitively price weapons systems for export, thereby perpetuating the
effect. This is why, for example, India\'s withdrawal from the joint
development and production of the Su-57 fighter aircraft last year has
cast doubt on Russia\'s ability to sustain the program in a meaningful
way or at an acceptable cost. As a result, Russia has sought --- albeit
unsuccessfully so far --- to export the Su-57 more widely in an effort
to find a partnership that would make the aircraft viable.

As a whole, **[it is becoming increasingly difficult to argue that the
United States is getting a good return on its investment in
Egypt]{.underline}**. Egypt has lost regional influence, but the United
States continues to provide al-Sisi's government with the second largest
FMF package in the world. Egypt is moving in the wrong direction,
endangering key U.S. interests in human rights and counterterrorism,
while rejecting U.S. advice on how to turn around this negative
trajectory. What can the United States do to break out of this
unsatisfactory cycle? There are two steps that Congress could take that
would both advance vital U.S. interests and ensure that the U.S.
investment in Egypt is proportional to its return. Both concern U.S.
military assistance to Egypt, which is no coincidence. The Egyptian
government values U.S. military assistance above all else. If the U.S.
government is to get through to al-Sisi's government, U.S. aid will have
to be put on (or off) the table. First, **[Congress should retain human
rights conditions on Egypt's military assistance package in the FY19
State and Foreign Operations appropriations bill. The Trump
administration made use of this conditionality last August when it
suspended \$195 million in FMF funding for Egypt]{.underline}**.19 **[As
a result of this pressure, the Egyptian government finally arranged for
a retrial in the infamous foreign funding case, in which 43 employees of
U.S. and German-based NGOs, including 17 Americans, received prison
sentences on politicized charges in 2013.]{.underline}**20 **[Egypt also
reportedly forced North Korea to reduce the staff level of its embassy
in Cairo, Pyongyang's largest mission in the region]{.underline}**.21
**[While neither step is sufficient to justify the release of the \$195
million, they indicate that U.S. pressure is having some effect. In
FY19, Congress should condition a portion of military assistance to
Egypt on progress in several important areas, including a cessation of
the investigation and arrest of activists and democracy promotion
organizations, the release of political prisoners, and granting U.S.
military officials access to the Sinai to perform end-use monitoring of
U.S.-made military equipment.]{.underline}** Second, **[Congress should
reduce military assistance to Egypt from \$1.3 billion to \$1 billion in
the FY19 appropriations bill, as proposed in the Senate Appropriations
Committee's markup]{.underline}**. As things currently stand, **[Egypt
both views U.S. military support as an entitlement and believes itself
to be more important to the United States than vice
versa]{.underline}**. Based on these perceptions, **[the Egyptian
government expects the United States will ultimately back down from any
threat or sanction, which undermines U.S. influence in Egypt. Reducing
Egypt's annual military assistance appropriation would send the
unmistakable message that the United States expects more in return for
its support to Egypt. In addition, by disabusing Egypt of the notion
that it can take its existing level of funding for granted, Congress can
restore U.S. leverage over the Egyptian government.22]{.underline}**

and indirectly supporting U.S. arms transfers.]{.underline}** **[Foreign
Military Financing]{.underline}**: Foreign Military Financing refers to
congressionally appropriated grants given to foreign governments to
finance the purchase of American-made weapons, services and training.
Since 1950, the US government has provided over \$91 billion in FMF to
militaries around the world. **[The vast majority of these funds goes to
Israel and Egypt]{.underline}** to reward them for making a cold peace
in 1979. **[Economic Support Fund:]{.underline}** Congress established
the economic support fund (ESF) to promote economic and political
stability in strategically important regions where the United States has
special security interests. The funds are provided on a grant basis and
are available for a variety of economic purposes, like infrastructure
and development projects. Although not intended for military
expenditure, these grants allow the recipient government to free up its
own money for military programs. **[International Military Education and
Training]{.underline}**: International Military Education and Training
(IMET) grants are given to foreign governments to pay for professional
education in military management and technical training on US weapons
systems. Over 2,000 courses are offered, including some on human rights
and civil-military relations. This program is said by its proponents to
promote positive military-to-military contacts, thereby familiarizing
foreign officers with \"US values and democratic processes,\" though
critics argue there is too much emphasis on military skills and not
enough on human rights. The Expanded IMET program offered to certain
states only focuses on the latter. **[Counter-Narcotics
Assistance]{.underline}**: Through International Narcotics Control
programs, the US government provides funds for military equipment and
training to overseas police and armed forces to combat the production
and trafficking of illegal drugs. These funds are generally dedicated to
the export of firearms and the refurbishment of surveillance aircraft,
transport planes and helicopters. Additional counter-narcotics training
and equipment is provided by the Department of Defense, the Drug
Enforcement Agency and other agencies. In recent years, human rights
abuses by military and police units receiving this aid - especially in
Colombia - have intensified criticism of the program.
**[Non-Proliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining, and Related
Programs]{.underline}**: This category of funding provides resources in
support of a variety of security-related foreign policy objectives.
Funds go to nuclear non-proliferation programs, anti-terrorism aid,
demining activities, and - a new item in FY 2001 - small arms
destruction programs. \"Anti-Terrorism Program of the Department of
State,\" State Department, 1985. Obtained by the National Security
Archive. **[Peacekeeping Operations]{.underline}**: These funds provide
voluntary support for international peacekeeping activities (as opposed
to the U.S. share of UN-assessed peacekeeping operations, which is
financed elsewhere). PKO funds promote increased involvement of regional
organizations in conflict resolution and help leverage support for
multinational efforts where no formal cost sharing mechanism is
available. **[Assistance for the Independent States of the Former Soviet
Union]{.underline}**: The Freedom Support Act (FSA) was passed in
Congress on October 24, 1992 with the goal of providing the states of
the former Soviet Union funds that support free market and democratic
reforms through demilitarization, humanitarian and technical assistance.
The bill particularly endorses American investment and trade through
enterprise funds, small business programs and access to credits for
purchases of U.S. food exports. The FSA also provides funding for
nuclear nonproliferation programs and activities, as well as the
dismantlement and destruction of biological, chemical and conventional
weapons, and humanitarian aid, including health and human services
programs. While funds allocated through this program are not used to
purchase weapons or military training per se, they are used to enhance
law enforcement and border security capabilities. These funds also free
up money that the recipient government can then spend in other ways,
including on defense.

**[Economic Support Funds (ESF) is economic aid designated to promote
economic or political stability in areas where the United States has
special strategic interests. Authorized under Chapter 4, Part II of the
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, ESF is a flexible assistance tool that
can be structured to meet a diverse range of foreign policy and economic
development objectives.]{.underline}** The makeup of ESF programs are
made on a country-specific basis, while the nature of ESF assistance to
a particular country is determined by a combination of the needs of the
recipient and U.S. foreign policy objectives. **[Among ESF's diverse
applications are the following programs (among others): advancing peace
and stability, building accountable and transparent institutions,
creating economic and educational opportunities for youth, countering
extremist ideology, counter-terrorism and counternarcotics, governance,
economic growth, anti-corruption, trade capacity building and democratic
strengthening.]{.underline}** The executive branch is responsible for
policy decisions and justifications for ESF use, including country
eligibility and funding levels. Originally, ESF was called Security
Supporting Assistance, which began in earnest in 1961, though it was
renamed ESF in 1971 to emphasize the economic development purposes of
the aid. Generally, ESF resources must be obligated within two years of
their original appropriation and have a liquidation term of five years.

[**The State Department's more recent decisions to reverse its aid hold
undercut this point of leverage**. **The United States' ability to
deftly balance sticks and carrots while pushing for reform has likewise
been undercut by the lack of a presidential envoy stationed in Cairo.
The position of U.S. ambassador to Egypt has been vacant since the July
2017 departure of Ambassador Steve Beecroft**. Local activists told
Human Rights First that the **lack of an ambassador weakens U.S.
influence in Egypt. They urge the Trump Administration to nominate, as
soon as possible, an experienced successor to Beecroft who understands,
and will promote, the vital role of civil society in Egypt.** For its
part, Congress has scrutinized the impact of governmental repression in
Egypt to a degree that has frequently exceeded that of the Trump
Administration. In July 2018, the House Foreign Affairs Committee's
Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa held hearings entitled
"Egypt: Security, Human Rights, and Reform." At the hearing, Chairperson
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (RFL) noted that since President Sisi's re-election,
"we have seen little indication that Egypt will be able to stabilize its
economy, secure its borders, improve its human rights record, or make
the reforms necessary to move forward."37 Over the last 12 months,
congressional interest in Egypt's human rights record has focused on
several key areas and cases. These include those convicted in the 173
foreign funding case, and the cases of U.S. legal permanent residents
Ola alQaradawi and her husband Hossam Khalaf, who have been jailed since
June last year. The couple, both of whom are in their 50s, were arrested
at their vacation home in Alexandria on June 30, 2017, allegedly due to
their affiliation with the banned Muslim Brotherhood organization and
other "terrorist" activities. Al-Qaradawi is the daughter of Yusuf
AlQaradawi, a leading Islamic scholar and Muslim Brotherhood member who
lives in exile in Qatar. She has been held in solitary confinement in
what the U.N.'s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights
described in July 2018 as "one of the worst prisons in Egypt." 38 Her
husband is being held in similar conditions in a different prison,
according to media reports.39 In June, the U.N. Working Group on
Arbitrary Detentions called for the couple's immediate release,
declaring that they are being arbitrarily detained, that repeated
renewals of 45-day detention orders are violating their rights to fair
trial and due process, and that Al-Qaradawi's prolonged solitary
confinement could also amount to torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading
treatment. The working group further stated that "Ms. al-Qaradawi and
Mr. Khalaf have been arrested and detained for their family ties with
Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi. This is the only plausible explanation for the
subversion of the equal protection of the law they experienced."40 These
interventions came after Congressman Randy Hultgren (R-IL), co-chair of
the House's Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, spoke out about the
couple in December 2017. In his remarks, Hultgren noted that Al-Qaradawi
and Khalaf have "eight American citizen family members," and that they
had both been denied access to family or legal counsel, and subjected to
dire prison conditions.41 These and other cases received significant
attention from U.S. media and politicians, and interest in the 2016
killing of Italian student Giulio Regeni in Cairo appears to hold the
concern of senior elements within the Egyptian government. In an
in-depth August 2017 investigative article for The New York Times,
reporter Declan Walsh revealed that, "In the weeks after Regeni's death,
the United States acquired explosive intelligence from Egypt: proof that
Egyptian security officials had abducted, tortured and killed Regeni."
Walsh further reported that an Obama administration official told him,
''We had incontrovertible evidence of official Egyptian
responsibility...There was no doubt.''42 Walsh's reporting indicates
that the U.S. government passed its conclusion to the Italian
government. "What the Americans knew for certain, they told the
Italians, was that Egypt's leadership was fully aware of the
circumstances around Regeni's death," wrote Walsh, who also reported
that then-secretary of state John Kerry bluntly raised the issue with
Egypt's foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, during a 2016 meeting.43
Authorities have gone so far as to arrest activist Amal Fathy, the wife
of Mohamed Lotfy, executive director of the Egyptian Commission on
Rights and Freedom (ECRF), which represents the Regeni family in the
murder's ongoing investigation. Detained in May, Fathy was initially
held on the grounds that she posted an online video complaining about
sexual harassment. She was later charged with "joining a terrorist
group" and "using the internet to call for acts of terrorism." Sources
close to her case say her detention may also serve as a reprisal against
the ECRF's work on the Regeni case.44 In March, Senators Marco Rubio
(R-FL) and Bob Menendez (D-NJ) introduced a resolution pointedly noting
that the Egyptian government "has created a hostile environment for
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), which provide essential services
to the people of Egypt and for whom peaceful association for civic
activities is a fundamental right."45 Two months later, Rubio's office
tweeted support for awardwinning photojournalist Mahmoud Abou Zeid,
better known as Shawkan, who was arrested in 2013 for covering anti-Sisi
protests. "The Egyptian government should immediately release
photojournalist \@ShawkanZeid, who was arrested while covering the 2013
protests in Egypt. He faces trial once again this weekend on false
charges and could face the death penalty. #ExpressionNOToppression,\"
said the tweet.46 On September 8, 2018, an Egyptian court sentenced
Shawkan to five years imprisonment in a mass trial where 612 defendants
were convicted, including 75 to death.47 These and other members of the
Congress are rightly concerned over the deteriorating situation. As
local activists relayed to Human Rights First, members of Congress
should follow their statements by increasing the amount of FMF
apportioned to Egypt that is conditioned on human rights improvements to
at least three hundred million dollars in the FY2019 Appropriations Act.
The Senate version of the bill currently includes a provision for the
conditioning of aid at this level, while the House version does not.
While providing flexibility in the event of an actual national
emergency, members should also limit the secretary of state's ability to
invoke a national security waiver to end-run congressional intent.
Conclusion: Using Leverage Wisely Egyptian activists continue to ask
that American officials speak out publicly and privately on their
behalf, and on behalf of democratic values. Local activists relayed to
Human Rights First that they are registering a decline in visits to
Egypt from members of Congress over the last year, which they find
worrisome. They urge members to travel to Egypt in order to consult with
civil society and to press Egyptian officials in person on the vital
need for reform. Indicative of this message, one human rights activist
who wished to remain anonymous to ensure his personal safety told a
Human Rights First researcher that "Dozens of us are on travel bans. We
can't leave the country, so now we need international politicians to
come to us to hear what we have to say, to see for themselves."48 More
broadly, the U.S. government needs to rethink its relationship with
Egypt. The United States remains the Egyptian government's most valued
security partner, and making military aid conditional on human rights
improvements is the most obvious way that the U.S. government can press
its ally for reform. For years, successive administrations delivered aid
to the Egyptian government regardless of its actions. Such an approach
has all but guaranteed a vicious cycle of 48 Interview with civil
society leader, Cairo July 2018. repression, resentment, radicalization,
and upheaval. It's long past time for implementation of a new approach,
one that uses U.S. leverage to nudge its ally toward a more stable and
sustainable politics. Discussions over the final version of the FY2019
Appropriations Act are currently under way in Congress. During the
conference process, members should examine the overarching nature of the
United States' aid relationship with Egypt, and ask whether the \$1.3
billion in FMF annually continues to serve American interests. A
nostrings-attached approach to such aid has clearly been shown to enable
the Sisi government's repression. At present, given the approach adopted
by the Trump Administration, **Egypt believes that the United States
will support it unconditionally, given a lack of viable alternatives.
This belief is misguided, and, in the long-run, will serve neither
Egyptian nor U.S. interests**. Recommendations **The Trump
Administration should**: ◼ **Announce that, moving forward, it will
withhold all FMF conditioned by Congress until the Egyptian government
fulfills publicly acknowledged human rights benchmarks**. The
administration should **use the leverage provided under existing
legislation to push for substantial progress, including by demanding
that the Egyptian government declare innocent those convicted in the
first trial phase of Case 173, dropping charges against all others
subsequently charged in subsequent phases of the same case, releasing
other political prisoners, lifting restrictions on the media, and Aiding
Repression in Egypt** 11 HUMAN RIGHTS FIRST holding senior government
officers found guilty of human rights violations accountable. ◼ **Speak
clearly and consistently to Egyptian leadership at the highest levels
about the concrete reforms it expects and how human rights intersect
with national security.** These messages should include a demand for an
end to the sustained attack on independent human rights organizations
and peaceful dissidents, progress **combating engrained institutional
discrimination against religious minorities, an end to enforced
disappearances and torture, the release of prisoners detained after
unfair trials for nonviolent political offenses, and the lifting of
restrictions on freedom of expression.** ◼ **Issue public statements
making clear to President Sisi and his government that deepening
repression in Egypt erodes the country's security and threatens U.S.
interests.** ◼ **Nominate a suitably qualified ambassador to Egypt as
soon as possible**. ◼ **Negotiate a durable arrangement with Egyptian
authorities to ensure the long-term stability and integrity of U.S.
assistance to independent human rights groups**. ◼ **Review the totality
of the United States' aid relationship with Egypt to better address the
security and other needs of Egyptians, and to better serve American
interests**. ◼ **Sanction individual Egyptian officials found to have
engaged in human rights abuses using authority provided under the Global
Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act.** Members of Congress should:
**◼ Increase the amount of FMF funding tied to human rights conditions
in the FY2019 Appropriations Act and future legislation to at least
three hundred million dollars; and limit the secretary of state's
ability, absent a national emergency, to invoke a national security
waiver to end-run congressional intent**. ◼ **Visit Egypt to meet with
civil society leaders and human rights activists to hear first-hand how
the U.S. government can support longterm stability and security**. ◼
**Adopt a resolution calling for an end to discrimination against
Egypt's Coptic Christian minority and for an end to impunity for attacks
on Christians and Christian property**, such as H. Res. 673, which
enjoys bipartisan support in the House.49]{.underline}

## Condition CP

Note -- may need to be changed depending on plan text

#### CP: The United States federal government should:

#### Eliminate all arms sales to Egypt excluding sales for counter-terrorism, maritime security, border protection, and security in the Sinai Peninsula.

#### Condition future sales on respect for human rights, transparency in military operation, and genuine efforts to limit civilian casualties.

#### Eliminate cash-flow financing for arms sales to Egypt. 

#### Solves the aff but maintains US hegemony, anti-terrorism efforts, border protection, and security

Seth **Binder** 3/28/**18** \[Lobe Log, "Time To Rethink U.S. Military
Aid To Egypt"\] \[DS\]
\[https://lobelog.com/time-to-rethink-u-s-military-aid-to-egypt/\]

Rethinking Aid It's time to rethink the military aid the United States
should provide to Egypt and under what conditions. The current system
isn't working. **[The equipment and training supplied with U.S.
assistance should be relevant to the anti-terror mission. The Obama
administration made an important step in the right direction when it
ended cash-flow financing and de-emphasized sales of big-ticket items
with little relevance to Egypt's most urgent security needs and focused
instead on equipment and training relevant to four key priorities:
counter-terrorism, maritime security, border protection, and security in
the Sinai Peninsula. Respect for human rights, transparency in military
operations, and genuine efforts to limit civilian casualties are
preconditions for effective counter-terrorism operations. Continued U.S.
military aid to Egypt should be conditioned on these criteria. The level
of U.S. military aid to Egypt should be tied to the level of security
benefits the U.S. receives in return.]{.underline}** The fact that Egypt
currently consumes nearly one-quarter of all assistance under the FMF
program and historically has been one of the largest recipients of
military aid suggests that a realignment may be in order. It's long past
time to reconsider the amount, content, and conditions under which the
United States continues to provide military assistance to Egypt. Such
substantial support for an increasingly authoritarian regime does not
serve the long-term interests of Egypt or the United States.

## Reform CP

#### **CP:**

#### The United States federal government should

#### Publicly disclose its arms exports and transfers to Egypt

#### Prioritize training and assistance that falls in line with international human rights law

**[Make U.S. arms exports public:]{.underline}** The U.S. **[should
publicly disclose its arms exports and transfers to Egypt. The arms
sales of greatest concern are often of low dollar value and seldom

prioritize training and assistance arrangements that include rigorous
practical exercises and operating standards designed to advance full
respect for international human rights law. Egyptian participants --
both trainees and trainers -- should be vetted to make sure they are not
themselves implicated in serious human rights abuses.]{.underline}** Our
letter followed several Amnesty International reports finding that
Egyptian military and security forces used excessive and lethal force
used against Egyptians. Time and time again, Amnesty International found
that Egyptian forces targeted and used live ammunition against
bystanders and unarmed protesters. Not only that, but Egyptian security
forces failed to meet international standards that require that lethal
force be used only in situations where lives are in danger. The White
House decision fell short of the kind of systematic review necessary to
bring public transparency to U.S. arms sales to Egypt. Amnesty
International's researchers also found multiple human rights abuses
committed by some supporters of former President Morsi, but these in no
way excuse the violations and excessive force of the Egyptian government
forces. In fact, Amnesty International's documentation makes clear that
this was not the only period of human rights violations by security
forces. It was part of a pattern of behavior by the Egyptian forces
dating back to the Mubarak regime. Our researchers visited morgues and
hospitals and found repeated evidence of gun violence by security forces
intended to kill and maim peaceful people. Our own documentation was
backed up by video recordings of the incidents. **[Despite this
undeniable record of misconduct by Egypt's security forces, the U.S.
government still authorized arms exports to Egypt that bore a
substantial risk of being used to commit or facilitate serious human
rights violations]{.underline}**. These arms have included pump-action
shotguns, military rifles, machine guns, ammunition, tear gas and other
toxic agents. They have also included spare parts for AH-64 Apache
attack helicopters used by Egyptian forces in surveillance of the Cairo
protest camps, and armored Caterpillar D7R bulldozers to break up those
camps.

## Nuke Terror CP

Note -- this card functions as impact defense as well as a CP

#### CP: 

#### The United States federal government should tighten security at civilian and government nuclear sites. 

#### Nuke terror is impossible but the CP solves any risk

**Ward 18** (Antonia, defense and security analyst for RAND research
institute, 7/27/18, \"Is Nuclear Terrorism Distracting Attention from
More Realistic Threats?\",

jbarber

At the final Nuclear Summit of his presidency in Washington, D.C., in
2016, Barack **[Obama said the risk of ISIS or other extremist groups
acquiring nuclear weapons remains "one of the greatest threats to global
security]{.underline}**." A number of terrorist groups, including ISIS
and al-Qaeda, have expressed explicit intentions to acquire and use
nuclear material. However, **[countries face far more pressing threats
than nuclear terrorism and authorities would be better off focusing on
insurgents\' frequent use of conventional weapons, such as chemicals and
bombs. Nuclear terrorism, defined as "the use or threat to use nuclear
material, nuclear fuel, or radioactive products for acts of terrorism,"
has elicited global concern and action]{.underline}**, as demonstrated
by the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, NATO\'s Defence Against
Terrorism Programme, and the EU Counter-Terrorism Strategy. There is
also a large amount of nuclear material present throughout the world;
the current global stockpile of highly enriched uranium (HEU) stands at
1.6 million kg. **[To construct a nuclear bomb, terrorists would need 25
kg of HEU]{.underline}**. This, compared to the amount held by states
throughout the world, is not an impossible amount for terrorists to
obtain. To contextualize this, in 2015 the United States possessed
62,900 tons of recoverable uranium. **[Several terrorist groups have
declared a desire to acquire nuclear material to construct a "dirty
bomb."]{.underline}** In 1998, Osama bin Laden, in a speech entitled
"Nuclear Bomb of Islam" stated that, "It is the duty of Muslims to
prepare as much force as possible to terrorize the enemies of God." In
2014, after capturing the Iraqi city of Mosul, **[ISIS had access
to]{.underline}** two caches of Cobalt 60 locked in a storage room at
Mosul University. This material has lethal levels of radiation, is used
to treat cancer cells, and is the **[core ingredient of a nuclear
bomb]{.underline}**. Government officials and nuclear experts speculated
that ISIS failed to utilize it, because they **[could not determine how
to access the Cobalt 60 without exposing themselves to deadly
radiation]{.underline}**. In 2016, after the two ISIS brothers involved
in the Brussels bombings, Khalid and Ibrahim el-Bakraoui, were killed
and captured, authorities discovered they had been secretly watching a
Belgian nuclear scientist who worked at the Tihange Nuclear Power
Station with the potential aim of using material from this facility.
Nuclear terrorism is a concern, but the majority of terror attacks are
conducted with conventional explosives. **[Despite Obama\'s remarks in
2016]{.underline}** and these two incidents**[, experts and officials
contest the viability of the nuclear terrorism threat]{.underline}**. Dr
Beyza Unal, a research fellow in nuclear policy at think tank Chatham
House, argued there is currently no evidence that terrorist groups could
build a nuclear weapon. Similarly, a report by the Council on Foreign
Relations in 2006 emphasized how **[building a nuclear bomb is a
difficult task for states, let alone terrorists]{.underline}**. This is
because of the **[issues involved in accessing uranium and creating and
maintaining it at the correct grade]{.underline}** (enriched uranium).
While nuclear terrorism is a concern, the majority of terrorist attacks
are conducted with conventional explosives. The 2017 Europol Terrorism
Situation and Trend Report states that 40 percent of terrorist attacks
used explosives. These explosives originate from a wide variety of
countries across the world. According to a study by Conflict Armament
Research, large quantities of explosive precursor chemicals used to make
bombs as seen in the 7/7 attack in London in 2005 and the 2017
Manchester Arena attack, have been linked to supply chains in the United
States, Europe, and Asia via Turkey. The threat from the spread of
chemical precursors prompted the EU to begin looking at ways to tighten
the regulations of these chemicals (PDF). **[A nuclear terrorist
attack]{.underline}** would have grave consequences, but it **[is
currently not a realistic or viable threat given that it would require a
level of sophistication from terrorists that has not yet been
witnessed.]{.underline}** **[The recent focus of terrorist groups has
been on simplistic strikes, such as knife and vehicular
attacks]{.underline}**. **[If countries are concerned about nuclear
terrorism, the best way to mitigate this risk could be to tighten
security at civilian and government nuclear sites]{.underline}**. But
governments would be better off focusing their efforts on combatting the
spread and use of conventional weapons.

## Nuke Terror CP #2

#### CP Text: All governments with nuclear weapons should do the following:

#### Increase the security of facilities that hold dual-use materials.

#### Require monthly check ups and deradicalization programs directed towards personnel in contact with CBRN material.

#### Require licenses to sell CBRN material commercially.

#### Introduce and/or strengthen radiation detection technology at sensitive facilities including financial centers and airports.

fear]{.underline}**. Moreover, while it is difficult to weaponise
chemical and biological agents, the threat of a use of dirty bomb
remains more plausible. ISIS has used chemical weapons to carry out
attacks. ISIS can also exploit the lax security surrounding facilities
in Iraq, Syria and Libya (RT 2015; Withnall 2015) holding CBRN materials
and obtain chemical, radiological and biological materials. **[The fact
that the illicit use of CBRN materials is not at all inconceivable is
highlighted in the report of the European Parliament. In order to
counter the use of CBRN weapons by terrorists, governments need to
increase security of facilities that hold dual-use materials. Given that
the greatest threat may also come with the help of an insider there is
also a need to keep a lookout for potential radicalisation of scientists
and experts who work in sensitive areas involving contact with handling
CBRN material. The commercial sale of such material also ought to be
licensed, so as to prevent the widespread availability of dual-use
materials in the open market. In addition, governments need to introduce
and/or strengthen radiation detection technology at sensitive facilities
including financial centres and airports. Acquiring CBRN weapon
materials and weaponising the same and managing the consequences of the
same is extremely complex and has a potential for detection by
government agencies. Nevertheless, governments must be more proactive in
controlling and protecting the facilities that can be infiltrated by
groups like ISIS.]{.underline}**

**[For the judiciary to restore its reputation]{.underline}**, it
**[must increase its independence from the other branches of
government.]{.underline}** Egypt's judges have been lobbying for exactly
this for decades. **[The executive branch]{.underline}** (acting through
the Ministry of Justice) **[exercises]{.underline}** far **[too much
authority]{.underline}** **[over the judiciary by influencing decisions
about]{.underline}** the **[hiring, appointment, promotion, and
disciplining of judges]{.underline}**. For example, at the executive
branch's discretion, some **[judges receive well-paid temporary
postings]{.underline}** to legal positions in the civil service and
courts of the Gulf states. (The Gulf states lack sufficient personnel to
fill these posts, so they recruit from Egypt.) **[Judges who seek these
postings have an unhealthy incentive to issue rulings favorable toward
the government.]{.underline}** **[The ministry can also influence the
appointment, promotion, and transfer of prosecutors, who]{.underline}**
therefore **[have reason to avoid cases that might anger the executive
branch, such as investigations into]{.underline}** **[human rights
violations]{.underline}** by the security services. **[There have been
almost no such investigations in recent years.]{.underline}** In
addition, **[the lack of clear criteria for the selection of judges
allows for personal connections and family ties to influence the
appointment process. Egypt's courts also need greater efficiency and
professionalism. They labor under an enormous backlog of
cases,]{.underline}** which slows the adjudication process to a crawl.
**[The judiciary]{.underline}** further **[suffers from a decades-long
decline in the quality of legal education]{.underline}**. **[The number
of law students has skyrocketed, without an accompanying increase in the
number of faculty qualified]{.underline}** to teach them. **[Legal
education]{.underline}** also **[emphasizes]{.underline}** rote
**[memorization rather than]{.underline}** the **[critical thinking
and]{.underline}** analytic **[reasoning]{.underline}** needed for
skilled judicial rulings. To improve the professionalism of the courts,
**[the government will need to allocate more resources to legal
education,]{.underline}** **[improve teaching techniques, and reform
curricula]{.underline}**. Several **[specialists have also suggested
creating a judicial academy]{.underline}** that would provide intensive
training to judges early in their careers and additional training as
they rise to higher positions. **[Government and international
organizations could help Egyptian courts address their debilitating
backlog by donating case management software]{.underline}**, helping to
revise courtroom procedures, and promoting mediation, arbitration, and
other means of resolving legal disputes outside of court. Another key
issue is the **[state of emergency, which has been in effect for over 50
years]{.underline}** (with some breaks here and there). **[Lifting it
was one of the protesters' key demands during the 2011
uprising.]{.underline}** **[Sisi has continued these
powers]{.underline}** instead: he declared a state of emergency
following the terrorist attacks on two Coptic churches in April 2017,
and the parliament has renewed the law every 90 days since. **[The
measure allows the president to transfer some defendants to special
emergency state security courts, and others to military courts, at his
discretion; he may also censor the press and shut down media
outlets]{.underline}**. But Egypt's ordinary laws are more than
sufficient to confront threats to national security, and its criminal
courts have a long record of vigorously prosecuting offenders,
especially in recent years. **[By lifting the state-of-emergency law,
Sisi would send a powerful signal about his willingness to work within
existing laws rather than trying to circumvent them.]{.underline}**

#### Strengthening the rule of law solves -- empirics

A skeptic might argue that bolstering legal institutions in a country
where the legal code was written by autocrats will simply strengthen
authoritarianism**[. But while Egypt's legal code contains many laws
that augment central power, it]{.underline}** also **[contains laws that
protect civil and political rights]{.underline}**. **[The constitution
protects the freedoms of assembly and expression, for
example]{.underline}**. **[Laws that compromise these rights could be
subject to legal challenge]{.underline}**. **[The SCC struck down part
of the protest law in 2016 on the grounds that it violated the
constitution.]{.underline}** **[The Court of Cassation]{.underline}**,
the country's highest appeals court, has **[voided several execution
orders against Islamist defendants]{.underline}** on the grounds that
evidence was gathered improperly. **[The administrative courts have
canceled some government orders to freeze the financial assets of
individuals with alleged ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.]{.underline}**
In one of the highest-profile rulings of recent years, **[administrative
judges also voided Sisi's transfer of sovereignty over two Red Sea
islands]{.underline}** (Tiran and Sanafir) to **[Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}** (the parliament later allowed the transfer to
proceed). Although not every judge will use the law in a progressive
manner, **[these cases provide reason to believe that some will. Egypt's
political leaders will be understandably reluctant to bolster
institutions]{.underline}** that might constrain their power.
**[Activists and governments must convince these leaders that they will
benefit from the same measures that will also make the Egyptian people
safer and more free---a rare case in which the interests of the people
and the regime align. There is little in the current political landscape
to encourage supporters of greater human rights and
dignity.]{.underline}** **[Strengthening the rule of law may be the only
peaceful way]{.underline}** **[to improve the lives of ordinary
Egyptians]{.underline}** living under an increasingly brutal
dictatorship.
