#### No Saudi prolif now -- they'll sign a CSA, but increased tensions could flip that

"Does the New Saudi Reactor Justify Proliferation
Fears?", <http://natoassociation.ca/does-the-new-saudi-reactor-justify-proliferation-fears/>\]

Notwithstanding the pessimistic assessment above, there are is a case to
be made that the **[proliferation fears should not be
overblown]{.underline}**. To begin with, **[the reactor's minuscule size
and limited capacity cannot possibly be construed as evidence of a
nascent weapons-grade capability]{.underline}**. And to help allay
proliferation fears, Robert Kelley, a US Department of Energy veteran,
expressed confidence that **[INVAP, the Argentine company assisting with
reactor construction, would not supply the Saudis with fuel until they
have signed a]{.underline}** Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement
(**[CSA]{.underline}**) that is not restricted by the Small Quantities
Protocol. In addition, **[the Saudi government has not displayed any
overt objection to taking that step]{.underline},** in the wake of IAEA
encouragement for it to allow the agency access to its facilities under
a CSA unhindered by the Small Quantities Protocol (SQP). In
conclusion, **[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** is one of many nations that
have **[declared]{.underline}** their **[interest in nuclear
power]{.underline}**, something they are entitled to under the
Non-proliferation Treaty. **[Its position as a regional power locked in
geopolitical competition with a rival]{.underline}** suspected to
attempting to go nuclear as well **[as the increasing pressure on the
international non-proliferation order justifies increased
attention]{.underline} **to that country.

#### US security guarantees prevent Saudi prolif -- arms sales are key

**Stein 2014**

\[Aaron, The National Interest, "Brandishing the American Sword in the
Gulf", <https://nationalinterest.org/commentary/brandishing-the-american-sword-the-gulf-10152>\]

American **[policymakers fear]{.underline} **that **[Iran's nuclear
program will prompt]{.underline}** other states in **[the region to
pursue dual-use technology]{.underline}** that could be used [**to
develop** **nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. Those fears are misplaced.
Turkey and Jordan have both opted for unique financing models for their
nuclear-power stations, which all but rules out the possibility of
clandestine nuclear-weapons development. The United Arab Emirates has
foresworn enrichment and reprocessing. Egypt has hinted that it may
relaunch its nuclear program, but there is absolutely no evidence that
it has taken steps to rectify the issues that have prevented its
procurement of reactors in the past. **[Saudi Arabia has indicated that
it might acquire a nuclear weapon, but its nuclear power plans remain on
the drawing board, and there are serious questions about whether or not
the Kingdom has the capacity to indigenously design, develop, and then
deploy nuclear weapons. Barring any radical shift from the current
status quo, the United States will continue to have to provide its
regional allies with nuclear assurances. Yet, the dynamics in the region
present a unique challenge to security planners]{.underline}** that may
be tempted to replicate American practice in South Korea. In the Korean
context, the Obama Administration has paired the continued deployment of
ground troops, with a "playbook" of scripted military responses designed
to demonstrate American resolve to use whatever means necessary to
defend Seoul. The plan hinges on publicizing U.S. military deployments
to the region, including the round-the-world flight of B-2 bombers
outfitted with dummy bombs that were dropped on a South Korean test
range. While the United States does station air and naval assets in the
Middle East---most notably in Bahrain---it is forced to keep the
presence of its military assets under wraps, or otherwise risk inflaming
anti-American sentiment. In the Middle East, the United States does not
and will not have the luxury of resorting to high-profile military
exercises and simulated nuclear-strike missions to reassure the Arab
states. A different approach is needed. **[In the past, the United
States has sought to reassure its allies with massive arms sales,
designed to ensure that the Arab states retain a technological military
advantage vis-à-vis the more numerous Iranian military. The United
States has also emphasized that the GCC purchase missile-defense
systems, which are designed to be interoperable with U.S.
missile-defense systems based in the region. The missile defense
architecture is intended to defend against Iranian ballistic missiles,
while also reassuring the Gulf allies of the viability of the U.S.
commitment to come to their defense]{.underline}.**This strategy has
some notable drawbacks. The pairing of precision-strike cruise missiles
with capable missile defenses incentivizes Iran to build more ballistic
missiles, so as to negate the GCC states' technological military edge.
This, in turn, creates the need for enhanced missile defenses and
greater precision strike. Thus, the two sides could find themselves
locked in a conventional-arms race that only helps further destabilize
the region. Absent a credible nuclear guarantee, the United States may
be faced with an escalating conventional arms build-up, fueled by
concerns that Iran's small enrichment program could still be used as the
basis for a nuclear weapons program. The situation necessitates the
crafting of a policy using a mixture of conventional weapons and the
nuclear forces in the triad---intercontinental Ballistic Missiles
(ICBMs), submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs) and heavy
bombers---to simultaneously reassure GCC allies and deter Iran. In the
past, the United States opted to reassure wary allies of its commitment
to use nuclear weapons with port visits made by ballistic missile
submarines. The political situation in the Middle East, however, would
appear to preclude such an option. The United States would have to
dedicate significant forces to protect its ballistic missile submarines,
or otherwise risk terrorists trying to target the sub in a similar
manner to that of the USS Cole. Moreover, for many leaders in the Gulf,
SSBN visits could be deemed too risky, lest such overt display of
American military hardware spark massive anti-American demonstrations,
or empower groups that abide by a religious ideology similar to that of
Al Qaeda. Absent these options, the two sides could opt to increase
consultations about nuclear war planning, in much the same way the
United States and Japan cooperated on the drafting of the 2010 Strategic
Posture Review. The United States could also teach courses in deterrence
at the recently established Gulf Academy for Strategic and Security
Studies in the UAE. More broadly, **[the crux of the U.S.-GCC
relationship will continue to hinge on the President's ability to
convince his/her GCC counterpart of the viability of the American
security guarantee]{.underline}.** The United States faced a similar
quandary during the Cold War. European allies openly worried about
Washington's commitment to use nuclear weapons against the Soviet Union,
lest such action lead to a Russian strike on the U.S. homeland. To
assuage these fears, the U.S., beginning in the 1950s, opted to deploy
nuclear weapons in NATO countries and eventually resulted in the
inclusion of the Allies in NATO nuclear-war planning. The United States
will not deploy nuclear weapons in the Middle East.
The **[assurance]{.underline}**, therefore, **[will have to be based on
conventional weapons, backed by an ironclad presidential guarantee of
the United States' willingness to use whatever means necessary to
protect its Gulf allies. This will require the U.S. President to
continue to prioritize its relationship with the GCC's
leadership]{.underline}**. The United States, therefore, has a perverse
incentive to retain the regional status quo, even though the current
situation fails to adhere to the promotion of democracy worldwide. And,
more broadly, it casts doubt on the notion that the United States will
abandon the Middle East, as it seeks to dedicate more resources to
Asia**. [Regardless of the outcome of the current talks with Iran, the
U.S. will retain a strong incentive to engage with its Arab allies on
deterrence and nuclear related issues.]{.underline}** The time for
debate about a future Iranian enrichment program has now passed. The
United States must now begin to craft a strategy to reassure very
skeptical allies. It wont be easy.

Sometimes It's Not Dollars, But Sense As [others have pointed
out](https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/31148092/CaverleyHegemony.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&Expires=1553650705&Signature=GcE9Nx9bdQ6zJK7l9yJLS3WKbUg%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DUnited_States_Hegemony_and_the_New_Econo.pdf),
the United States can afford to "make economic \[...\] sacrifices" in
order to privilege politico-security benefits in arms export decisions.
As one [author recently explained in War on the
Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2018/04/americas-arms-sales-policy-security-abroad-not-jobs-at-home/):
[The United States is so economically advantaged in making and selling
weapons that it can limit conventional-weapons
proliferation]{.underline} \[and\] ... technology diffusion, (and
maintain a robust defense industrial base) [while retaining its
commanding market position. This is undoubtedly true]{.underline}.
However, on rare occasions economics do matter. Specifically,
maintaining strategic flexibility by keeping a production line open
which would otherwise shutter might sometimes need to be prioritized.
Consider the two recent examples of the F-22 and F-15. In December 2011,
the [final F-22 fighter
jet](https://www.ajc.com/business/final-rolls-out-marietta-plant/ayu0mRpAyscAvsjPo6YKwN/)
rolled off the assembly line, 554 short of the original program
requirement. At the same time, close [U.S. allies such as
Japan](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/RS22684.pdf) and [Australia made
inquiries](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-arms-usa-congress/senate-panel-seeks-end-to-f-22-export-ban-idUSTRE5896JU20090910)
about purchasing further increments of the fifth-generation fighter,
which would have kept production going for at least several more years.
The United States rejected the inquiries, shuttering the production line
instead. [A 2011 RAND Corporation
study](https://www.rand.org/pubs/technical_reports/TR831.html) estimates
the cost of restarting production and fabricating 75 additional F-22s to
be \$17 billion --- nearly \$227 million per jet. Despite this cost and
because of an evolving international security environment, the [US
Congress inserted language into the 2017 defense
budget](http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AS/AS25/20160420/104831/BILLS-114HR4909ih.pdf)
directing the U.S. Air Force to conduct a "production restart
assessment," though the likelihood of a [production restart remains
infinitesimally
small](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2017/06/21/the-f22-fighter-jet-restart-dead-study.html).
Fortunately, the outcome is different for the F-15. In 2013, [Qatar made
a request for the purchase of 70
F-15QAs](https://www.stripes.com/news/middle-east/us-fighter-jet-sales-to-gulf-allies-stalled-for-up-to-3-years-1.416467),
worth \$4 billion. At the time, without another export order the 40-year
old F-15 production line was [slated to close by
2019](https://www.defensenews.com/breaking-news/2016/09/28/white-house-approves-jet-sales-to-qatar-bahrain-and-kuwait-corker/),
eliminating any future purchases. After delaying approval for nearly
three years, the U.S. administration finally [approved the deal in late
2016](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-approves-sale-boeing-fighter-jets-qatar-kuwait-193835787--sector.html),
guaranteeing F-15 production into the mid-2020s. Unlike the F-22, the
United States maintains strategic flexibility in F-15 (and F-18 and
F-16) production, largely because of exports. This appears to be an
especially prescient decision, as the [FY2020 U.S. Air Force budget
proposal](https://www.saffm.hq.af.mil/Portals/84/documents/FY20/PROCUREMENT/FY20_PB_3010_Aircraft_Vol-1.pdf?ver=2019-03-18-152821-713)
requests money to purchase at least eight (and up to 100) F-15EX air
superiority platforms; a platform [one industry reporter
highlighted](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/26305/f-15x-will-come-in-two-variants-and-no-it-wont-cost-100m-per-copy)
"is only possible because other countries have spent roughly \$5B over
the last couple of decades to continuously evolve the F-15 into what it
is today \[...\] basically, the \[Air Force\] is getting \[these
upgrades\] for free." [What About Saudi Arabia? In sum,]{.underline}
[more restrictive arms sales, delivery suspensions, or outright embargos
are unlikely to succeed in policy coercion]{.underline}. While **[arms
transfers provide an avenue of influence, embargos often lead to
diversification]{.underline}**, not desired policy changes.
Additionally, [fears of technology transfer and direct offsets creating
a competitor out of every client are generally unfounded in the high-end
market in which the United States generally deals.]{.underline} Finally,
while the large domestic market provides the United States the luxury of
sacrificing financial gains for political influence, sometimes economics
do matter, particularly when it comes to saving a production line for
future flexibility. [These conclusions should therefore inform U.S.
policy on Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. The intent here is not to argue the
moral or ethical responsibility of U.S. leaders in responding to Saudi
Arabia's execution of journalists or tactics in the war in Yemen. It is
natural to see the horror wrought in Yemen and want to take any actions
necessary to stop it. However, [I ultimately argue against a Saudi
embargo.]{.underline} This is not because, as the [president has
argued](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/20/donald-trump-saudi-arabia-arms-sales-jamal-khashoggi)[,
it might cost a few billion dollars and some hundreds of defense
industry jobs.]{.underline} As others have pointed out, the [economic
impact of Saudi arms
purchases](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/12/opinion/saudi-arabia-arms-sales.html)
on the U.S. defense industry is relatively small. Rather, [**embargoing
Saudi Arabia is unlikely to fundamentally alter Saudi policies**, but
likely to further damage U.S. ties with Riyadh.]{.underline} In the
near-term, [Saudi Arabia can substitute other weapons]{.underline}, such
as [the Eurofighter and
Tornado](https://www.flightglobal.com/asset/26019/waf/), and "dumb
bombs" [instead of U.S.-built "smart weapons.]{.underline}" The Saudis
can also rely more heavily on their Emirati and Egyptian partners using
non-U.S. produced arms. In the medium to long term, such an embargo is
likely to push the Kingdom to greater arms diversification. If history
is any guide, [the United States will eventually lift any potential arms
embargo with little change in Saudi behavior, but only after having
provided an opportunity for adversary states such as Russia and China to
gain a strategic foothold in Riyadh. [Some might
counter](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/12/opinion/saudi-arabia-arms-sales.html)
that it would be extremely difficult and costly, in both time and money,
for the Saudis to significantly diversify their arms acquisitions away
from the United States]{.underline}. This is absolutely the case.
However, costly does not mean impossible. Less wealthy states have
already done it. Egypt is one example above; but others [such as
Venezuela](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/28/world/americas/28Venezuela.html?mtrref=www.google.com&gwh=BF08049671740FF1B83419CD83BABC0E&gwt=pay)
and even tiny Kuwait --- [frustrated at years of U.S. approval
delays](https://www.defensenews.com/home/2016/04/05/kuwait-signs-eurofighter-jet-deal/)
--- have significantly diversified their arms acquisitions. In other
words, [with the money and options available to Saudi Arabia, and [few
other
producers](https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/22/middleeast/arms-exports-saudi-arabia-intl/index.html)
showing a stomach for a full embargo, it is not unreasonable to believe
that the Saudis might significantly diversify their arms acquisitions
over time in response to a U.S. embargo]{.underline}. Thus, [while a
U.S. embargo might be morally compelling and emotionally satisfying, it
is unlikely to create meaningful change for those most at risk or be
strategically beneficial to the United States.]{.underline} In the
absence of a compelling, evidence-based case that an arms embargo on
Saudi Arabia might produce desired changes in behavior, policymakers
should look elsewhere for solutions to their Saudi problems.

#### US influence in the middle east is a conflict dampener

**Brands 19** (Hal Brands- Henry A. Kissinger Distinguished Professor of
Global Affairs at the John Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies and a Senior Fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary
Assessments, 3-21-2019, \"Why America Can\'t Quit The Middle East,\"
Hoover Institution,
<https://www.hoover.org/research/why-america-cant-quit-middle-east>) RK

One of the most persistent myths about U.S. foreign policy is the idea
that America desires---due to greed, messianic ideological impulses, or
simple imperial presumptions---to dominate the Middle East. In reality,
[American policy has long been torn by two conflicting imperatives: The
need to protect enduring U.S. interests, on the one hand, and the desire
to stay clear of the region's unending headaches, on the
othe]{.underline}r. Paul Wolfowitz
[remarked](https://books.google.com/books?id=wcljXYTZVnUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=rise+of+the+vulcans&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjMsZTm7M3gAhWhc98KHU7-AIAQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=sunlight&f=false)
once that his shift from focusing on the Middle East to working on East
Asia was like "walking out of some oppressive, stuffy room into sunlight
and fresh air." To borrow the metaphor, American officials have long
desired to walk toward the sunlight---while understanding that they
cannot fully escape the darkness. Today, [calls for the United States to
disengage militarily from the Middle East are commonplace]{.underline}.
Those calls reflect deep frustration with the travails of American
interventions over the past two decades, as well as the
belief---entirely correct---that the United States faces greater
challenges elsewhere. [Yet U.S. interests in the region have not
disappeared, and the prospect that Middle Eastern troubles will impact
America if left unattended is as high as ever]{.underline}. **[If the
United States rushes for the exits, it may find that it is pulled back
under worse circumstances, and at higher costs, in the
future]{.underline}**. President Trump is giving voice to a powerful and
understandable urge to cut cleanly and get out of the Middle East. The
best approach, however, may be one that reflects America's longstanding
ambivalence about the region. The [interests that have long kept the
United States involved in the Middle East are fairly clear]{.underline}.
Coming out of World War II, American strategists resolved that [the
United States must prevent any hostile force from dominating a region of
critical geopolitical or geo-economic significance]{.underline}. The
Middle East, with its vast oil reserves, certainly fit that description.
True, America never got a particularly large portion of its oil from
Middle Eastern sources. But its allies did: "The Marshall Plan for
Europe,"
[noted](https://books.google.com/books?id=nGqoAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA267&dq=what+good+is+grand+strategy+middle+east+oil+forrestal&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjM7JyJ7c3gAhWKc98KHXGRAg0Q6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=what%20good%20is%20grand%20strategy%20middle%20east%20oil%20forrestal&f=false)
Truman's first Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal, "could not succeed
without access to the Middle East oil." Moreover, the fact that oil was
traded on a global market meant that a disruption of price or supply in
one region would cause disruption on a far larger scale. At present, the
United States is again becoming a net energy exporter and a swing
producer in the global oil market. Yet [so long as the countries of the
Middle East sit atop huge energy reserves that confer great wealth and
power on whoever controls it, the strategic importance of the Middle
East]{.underline}---[and the imperative of keeping it out of hostile
hands---will remain.]{.underline} Other issues have also kept the United
States engaged. Since the 1970s, America has had a critical interest in
preventing or combating international terrorism, much of which emerges
from the Middle East[. American policymakers have been properly
concerned with confronting aggression against friendly nations and
preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction to rogue states or
non-state actors]{.underline}. [Then there is the American interest in
promoting peace, democracy, and human rights in the Middle East---one
that has never been as important as the other U.S. interests, that has
affected how even the most cynical, "realist" administrations have
approached the region.]{.underline} Over a period of decades, these
issues have exerted a strong gravitational pull on American policy,
making it impossible for U.S. officials to ignore the region. And yet
American policymakers have often been equally aware of the problems that
U.S. engagement presents. The situation in the Middle East, Dean Acheson
once
[commented](https://books.google.com/books?id=nGqoAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA55&dq=what+good+is+grand+strategy+karl+marx&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiUjKb77M3gAhWNmeAKHQXeDNMQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&q=what%20good%20is%20grand%20strategy%20karl%20marx&f=false),
"might have been devised by Karl Marx himself." A combination of stunted
development, stifling socio-political conditions, and resentment of
foreign influence made the region ripe for radicalism and inherently
difficult for outside powers to manage. Getting deeply involved in the
Middle East ran the risk of making America the target of that radicalism
and anger; it also ran the risk of distracting the United States from
other areas where the prospects for constructive change seemed more
promising. The Middle East, Wolfowitz
[lamented](https://books.google.com/books?id=wcljXYTZVnUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=rise+of+the+vulcans&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjMsZTm7M3gAhWhc98KHU7-AIAQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=sunlight&f=false),
was an area "where people only know how to create problems." The result
has been a perpetual tension: The Middle East might require American
attention and management, but it was also a source of dangers and
distractions that most U.S. officials would have been just as happy to
avoid. This tension has been omnipresent as the U.S. role in the Middle
East has expanded since the 1970s, following the British withdrawal from
the region. During the late 1970s and 1980s, the United States [built
up](https://books.google.com/books?id=bKA9DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=making+the+unipolar+moment&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjsutKm7c3gAhXiYd8KHSzBAsgQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=making%20the%20unipolar%20moment&f=false)
the military capabilities necessary to prevent the Soviet Union (or
perhaps a hostile Iran) from dominating the region. During the Iran-Iraq
War, the Reagan administration supported Saddam Hussein as a bulwark
against Tehran's influence. But at the same time, the United States
refrained from a significant "onshore" military presence in the Persian
Gulf out of fear of inciting terrorist attacks, offending local
sensitivities, or discrediting friendly regimes. Once the Iran-Iraq War
ended, American military capabilities started flowing out of the region,
to be refocused on other priorities. That trend was reversed after
Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait prompted a massive, U.S.-led
intervention to restore the regional balance of power, as well as a
persistent post-conflict military presence to keep an eye on Saddam's
wounded but still dangerous regime. As early as 1990-91, however, U.S.
officials had been deeply
[ambivalent](https://books.google.com/books?id=bKA9DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=making+the+unipolar+moment&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjsutKm7c3gAhXiYd8KHSzBAsgQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=making%20the%20unipolar%20moment&f=false)
about the idea of permanently stationing American forces in Saudi Arabia
or other Gulf countries. They worried that such a presence might make
American forces the target of terrorist groups that opposed
authoritarian governments in the Persian Gulf---warnings that seemed
vindicated when al-Qaeda began taking aim at U.S. targets in the region
and far beyond. The 9/11 attacks offered evidence that the Middle East's
problems could reach out and touch the United States in disastrous ways.
The George W. Bush administration responded with the massive projection
of American power into the region, focused on defeating al-Qaeda,
toppling hostile governments in Afghanistan and Iraq, birthing stable
democracies, and thereby transforming the region for the better. When
that project proved vastly more costly and difficult than expected, the
Obama administration sought to limit U.S. engagement in the region as a
way of husbanding resources, avoiding blowback, and "pivoting" to more
promising areas. Yet even Obama, so skeptical of American intervention
in the region, was unable to get out entirely: The persistent threat of
terrorism compelled continuing engagement in Afghanistan; humanitarian
concerns triggered military action in Libya; the U.S. withdrawal from
Iraq and inaction in Syria contributed to a regional meltdown that
ultimately compelled re-intervention to deal with a new and terrifying
threat from ISIS. The story of American policy in the Middle East has
been one of engagement---sometimes remarkably intensive and violent
engagement---but also one of recurring ambivalence about that
engagement. Today, the [Trump]{.underline} administration [is
manifesting]{.underline} the same [ambivalence]{.underline}. The
president reportedly referred to Syria as a country offering only "sand
and death," and he announced plans for a complete withdrawal of U.S.
troops. [Trump appears to be eyeing the exits in
Afghanistan]{.underline} as well. But at the same time, a familiar set
of factors is making other U.S. officials reluctant to countenance a
broad withdrawal. The U.S. intelligence community has warned that a
complete pullout from Afghanistan could lead to a major terrorist attack
on the American homeland within two years. [There are also concerns that
American retrenchment would open the door for hostile
actors]{.underline}---Iran and Russia---[to exert dominant influence in
a region that still matters]{.underline}. Trump is a most unorthodox
president, but he faces the same dilemma that has long afflicted U.S.
policy in the Middle East. Indeed, that dilemma may explain why the
president---after insisting for months that the United States would
withdraw entirely from Syria, just recently indicated that a token
American force might remain. [So what can this history tell us about how
to proceed today?]{.underline} Three key points are in order. First,
there is a critical need to meter U.S. involvement in the Middle East.
This is not simply because large-scale interventions have proven so
unrewarding over the past two decades. It is also because the need to
confront other, more important issues---namely the threats posed by
China and Russia---is undeniable. There is a finite amount of resources,
time, and political will the United States can devote to foreign policy
issues. And when Washington overcommits to a region as frustrating as
the Middle East, it risks undermining public support for U.S. foreign
policy not just in that region but around the world. If the United
States goes big in the Middle East, it will sooner or later face strong
pressures to go home. Second, however[, it is a fantasy to think that
the United States can disengage from the Middle East without
consequence]{.underline}. This is because [America still has pressing
interests in that region]{.underline}---and because those interests are
as unlikely to protect themselves today as they ever have been in the
past. **[Growing Russian influence, Iran's hegemonic ambitions, the
potential resurgence of key terrorist organizations, and the massive
political instability and violence that plagues large swaths of the
region are real problems that demand competent
management]{.underline}**. [America's partners in the region can do more
to manage those problems than they have done to date, but they remain
manifestly incapable of doing so without significant U.S.
support.]{.underline} Third, hasty withdrawals are likely to be followed
by hasty re-engagements. After the United States left Iraq in 2011, the
state nearly collapsed, ISIS surged to prominence, and an emergency
military intervention---which has now lasted nearly five years---was
needed to repair the damage. If the United States disengages from Syria
and Afghanistan today and the result is a significant terrorist attack,
the pressure to get back into the region and take decisive military
action will be strong indeed---even if that means shortchanging other
geopolitical priorities. If America goes home from the Middle East, it
will sooner or later face pressures to go big. Whatever policies the
Trump administration pursues in the Middle East, then, [the United
States will continue to face the same conflicting imperatives that have
long shaped its approach to that region. America will be drawn toward
the Middle East by enduring interests and pressing threats]{.underline}.
[But it will be tempted to depart the region because of the dangers and
costs U.S. engagement causes.]{.underline} In these circumstances, [a
responsible strategy would focus on minimizing the dangers and costs of
engagement by suppressing the most serious threats at the lowest
expenditure of resources. This]{.underline} [might entail using a select
subset of capabilities]{.underline}---**[special operations forces,
tactical airpower, support for local forces]{.underline}**---[to keep
the pressure]{.underline} [on the most dangerous terrorist groups and
prevent them from mounting major external attacks]{.underline}. (This
was, in essence, the strategy the United States was following prior to
Trump's Syria withdrawal announcement.) Likewise, [it might focus on
empowering---with]{.underline} intelligence, diplomatic, and [military
support---anti-Iran actors in the region and thereby maintaining a
tolerable balance of power]{.underline}. In Afghanistan, this might mean
continuing to push for a negotiated peace deal, but only with adequate
assurances that an American withdrawal would not turn that country into
a terrorist playground---and without telegraphing a near-term retreat
that will only make such assurances harder to obtain. [The worst
strategies,]{.underline} by contrast, [would be those that skew toward
the extremes of deeper engagement or precipitate
withdrawal]{.underline}, [inviting some adverse development that would
cause an overcorrection in the future]{.underline}. "Muddle through" is
rarely the sort of advice that wins a lot of applause. But it may be the
best approach to managing America's continuing strategic ambivalence
about the Middle East.

#### No Saudi prolif now -- they'll sign a CSA, but increased tensions could flip that

Notwithstanding the pessimistic assessment above, there are is a case to
be made that the **[proliferation fears should not be
overblown]{.underline}**. To begin with, **[the reactor's minuscule size
and limited capacity cannot possibly be construed as evidence of a
nascent weapons-grade capability]{.underline}**. And to help allay
proliferation fears, Robert Kelley, a US Department of Energy veteran,
expressed confidence that **[INVAP, the Argentine company assisting with
reactor construction, would not supply the Saudis with fuel until they
have signed a]{.underline}** Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement
(**[CSA]{.underline}**) that is not restricted by the Small Quantities
Protocol. In addition, **[the Saudi government has not displayed any
overt objection to taking that step]{.underline},** in the wake of IAEA
encouragement for it to allow the agency access to its facilities under
a CSA unhindered by the Small Quantities Protocol (SQP). In
conclusion, **[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** is one of many nations that
have **[declared]{.underline}** their **[interest in nuclear
power]{.underline}**, something they are entitled to under the
Non-proliferation Treaty. **[Its position as a regional power locked in
geopolitical competition with a rival]{.underline}** suspected to
attempting to go nuclear as well **[as the increasing pressure on the

attention]{.underline} **to that country.

#### US security guarantees prevent Saudi prolif -- arms sales are key

**Stein 2014**

\[Aaron, The National Interest, "Brandishing the American Sword in the
Gulf", <https://nationalinterest.org/commentary/brandishing-the-american-sword-the-gulf-10152>\]

American **[policymakers fear]{.underline} **that **[Iran's nuclear
program will prompt]{.underline}** other states in **[the region to
pursue dual-use technology]{.underline}** that could be used [**to
develop** **nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. Those fears are misplaced.
Turkey and Jordan have both opted for unique financing models for their
nuclear-power stations, which all but rules out the possibility of
clandestine nuclear-weapons development. The United Arab Emirates has
foresworn enrichment and reprocessing. Egypt has hinted that it may
relaunch its nuclear program, but there is absolutely no evidence that
it has taken steps to rectify the issues that have prevented its
procurement of reactors in the past. **[Saudi Arabia has indicated that
it might acquire a nuclear weapon, but its nuclear power plans remain on
the drawing board, and there are serious questions about whether or not
the Kingdom has the capacity to indigenously design, develop, and then
deploy nuclear weapons. Barring any radical shift from the current
status quo, the United States will continue to have to provide its
regional allies with nuclear assurances. Yet, the dynamics in the region
present a unique challenge to security planners]{.underline}** that may
be tempted to replicate American practice in South Korea. In the Korean
context, the Obama Administration has paired the continued deployment of
ground troops, with a "playbook" of scripted military responses designed
to demonstrate American resolve to use whatever means necessary to
defend Seoul. The plan hinges on publicizing U.S. military deployments
to the region, including the round-the-world flight of B-2 bombers
outfitted with dummy bombs that were dropped on a South Korean test
range. While the United States does station air and naval assets in the
Middle East---most notably in Bahrain---it is forced to keep the
presence of its military assets under wraps, or otherwise risk inflaming
anti-American sentiment. In the Middle East, the United States does not
and will not have the luxury of resorting to high-profile military
exercises and simulated nuclear-strike missions to reassure the Arab
states. A different approach is needed. **[In the past, the United
States has sought to reassure its allies with massive arms sales,
designed to ensure that the Arab states retain a technological military
advantage vis-à-vis the more numerous Iranian military. The United
States has also emphasized that the GCC purchase missile-defense
systems, which are designed to be interoperable with U.S.
missile-defense systems based in the region. The missile defense
architecture is intended to defend against Iranian ballistic missiles,
while also reassuring the Gulf allies of the viability of the U.S.
commitment to come to their defense]{.underline}.**This strategy has
some notable drawbacks. The pairing of precision-strike cruise missiles
with capable missile defenses incentivizes Iran to build more ballistic
missiles, so as to negate the GCC states' technological military edge.
This, in turn, creates the need for enhanced missile defenses and
greater precision strike. Thus, the two sides could find themselves
locked in a conventional-arms race that only helps further destabilize
the region. Absent a credible nuclear guarantee, the United States may
be faced with an escalating conventional arms build-up, fueled by
concerns that Iran's small enrichment program could still be used as the
basis for a nuclear weapons program. The situation necessitates the
crafting of a policy using a mixture of conventional weapons and the
nuclear forces in the triad---intercontinental Ballistic Missiles
(ICBMs), submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs) and heavy
bombers---to simultaneously reassure GCC allies and deter Iran. In the
past, the United States opted to reassure wary allies of its commitment
to use nuclear weapons with port visits made by ballistic missile
submarines. The political situation in the Middle East, however, would
appear to preclude such an option. The United States would have to
dedicate significant forces to protect its ballistic missile submarines,
or otherwise risk terrorists trying to target the sub in a similar
manner to that of the USS Cole. Moreover, for many leaders in the Gulf,
SSBN visits could be deemed too risky, lest such overt display of
American military hardware spark massive anti-American demonstrations,
or empower groups that abide by a religious ideology similar to that of
Al Qaeda. Absent these options, the two sides could opt to increase
consultations about nuclear war planning, in much the same way the
United States and Japan cooperated on the drafting of the 2010 Strategic
Posture Review. The United States could also teach courses in deterrence
at the recently established Gulf Academy for Strategic and Security
Studies in the UAE. More broadly, **[the crux of the U.S.-GCC
relationship will continue to hinge on the President's ability to
convince his/her GCC counterpart of the viability of the American
security guarantee]{.underline}.** The United States faced a similar
quandary during the Cold War. European allies openly worried about
Washington's commitment to use nuclear weapons against the Soviet Union,
lest such action lead to a Russian strike on the U.S. homeland. To
assuage these fears, the U.S., beginning in the 1950s, opted to deploy
nuclear weapons in NATO countries and eventually resulted in the
inclusion of the Allies in NATO nuclear-war planning. The United States
will not deploy nuclear weapons in the Middle East.
The **[assurance]{.underline}**, therefore, **[will have to be based on
conventional weapons, backed by an ironclad presidential guarantee of
the United States' willingness to use whatever means necessary to
protect its Gulf allies. This will require the U.S. President to
continue to prioritize its relationship with the GCC's
leadership]{.underline}**. The United States, therefore, has a perverse
incentive to retain the regional status quo, even though the current
situation fails to adhere to the promotion of democracy worldwide. And,
more broadly, it casts doubt on the notion that the United States will
abandon the Middle East, as it seeks to dedicate more resources to
Asia**. [Regardless of the outcome of the current talks with Iran, the
U.S. will retain a strong incentive to engage with its Arab allies on
deterrence and nuclear related issues.]{.underline}** The time for
debate about a future Iranian enrichment program has now passed. The
United States must now begin to craft a strategy to reassure very
skeptical allies. It wont be easy.

#### Studies prove nuclear prolif makes actors [irrational]{.underline} and overwhelms impact D---escalation is [likely]{.underline}

**Quek, 16**---Department of Politics and Public Administration,
University of Hong Kong (Kai, "Nuclear Proliferation and the Use of
Nuclear Options," Political Research Quarterly June 2016 vol. 69 no. 2
195-206, dml) \["N" in "N = 2" refers to the number of states with a
nuclear option in a crisis\]

[Does nuclear proliferation affect the risk that nuclear weapons will be
used in a crisis?]{.underline} The question implicates human survival
but is difficult to study, as observations of nuclear war do not
actually exist. Our empirical knowledge is thus limited. I use
experimental games with nuclear options to circumvent the observational
constraint and construct empirical tests. I find that [decisions are
**mostly peaceful** at N = 2 despite the existence of nuclear options
with a relative first-strike advantage]{.underline}. This finding is
especially relevant as [most nuclear-state confrontations in history had
been **bilateral crises**]{.underline}. More generally, I find that [one
is less likely to choose the nuclear option when it is known that the
number of nuclear actors in the crisis is small, and **more likely to
choose the nuclear option** when it is known that the number of nuclear
actors is **large**]{.underline}. In particular, [a jump in the number
of nuclear actors in crisis beyond N = 2 **significantly increases the
chance** of **choosing the nuclear option**]{.underline}. Preliminary
probes also suggest that players in inter-alliance crises are more
peaceful when they have second-strike countervalue capabilities, and
that nuclear framing has no significant effect on the use of the nuclear
option. To my knowledge, [this is the **first randomized experiment** in
political science that focuses on the relationship between proliferation
and the use of nuclear options]{.underline}.23 In a fortunate world
where nuclear war remains unobserved, there are justifications for an
experimental approach on theoretical, practical, and ethical grounds.
Methodologically, [the use of a controlled experiment also allows for a
**clean identification** of the causal relationship]{.underline},. This
experiment focuses exclusively on the strategic dimension. It also
assumes that the crisis has already escalated to the point where players
are considering the use of the nuclear option, and thus it does not
address the ex ante question of whether nuclear weapons would make
states more cautious about avoiding conflict escalation in the first
place (Waltz 2003). Nonetheless, while the focus of the experiment is
narrow, it is a useful first step toward understanding the strategic
effects of proliferation on the risk of nuclear conflict. Several
implications arise for future research. First, with the basic mechanism
established, we now have a baseline for future experiments that explore
various realistic complications to the nuclear-option game. For
instance, do interactions between nuclear actors change when we
introduce different types of psychological stress, or different stake
sizes, or different asymmetries in the expected cost of nuclear
conflict? In particular, an interesting extension of this experiment
would be to study how behavior differs---or does not---across
interactions with different combinations of nuclear and non-nuclear
actors. The results suggest that [**distrust over the rationality** of
other players **increases** with an increase in the N parameter, and
**weakens the tendency** toward the payoff-dominant outcome of
**peaceful restraint**]{.underline}. Thus, [proliferation may be
dangerous **even in a world of states trying to behave rationally**,
contrary to the arguments made by **Waltz**]{.underline} (2003) [and
others in which the **common knowledge of rationality is assumed**. The
results also offer an **interesting contrast** with **Asal and
Breadsley's**]{.underline} (2007) [finding that the risk of]{.underline}
(non-nuclear) [war is higher when the number of nuclear actors in crisis
is lower]{.underline}. This contrast raises the hypothesis that [states
in bilateral crises may choose to **drag out a crisis** as the risk of
nuclear war is **lower under N = 2**]{.underline}, as suggested by our
results.24 This hypothesis has practical importance and should be
investigated in future research.

S[audi Arabia has little nuclear infrastructure today, and acquiring
nuclear weapons is a difficult process for any country]{.underline}. At
this point in time and at its current pace of nuclear development,
[Saudi Arabia would require years to create the nuclear infrastructure
needed to launch a nuclear weapons effort]{.underline}. Our open source
research, which includes translations from Arabic of official Saudi
statements, nuclear infrastructure plans, and domestic research, shows
that [Saudi Arabia is not likely to have launched any domestic covert
nuclear programs to create the wherewithal to build nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} Instead, [like other cases of proliferant states
and territories]{.underline}, such as South Africa, Iran, and Taiwan, it
appears that [Saudi Arabia is concentrating on building up its civilian
nuclear infrastructure]{.underline}. [It is acquiring nuclear or
nuclear-related facilities and committing to placing them under
international inspections according to international norms.]{.underline}
Saudi Arabia has thus far embarked on a path to seek civil nuclear
assistance from several nations, including Russia, South Korea, and
China. [It]{.underline} [is also researching civil nuclear applications
and developing a robust nuclear engineering and scientific workforce.
Any research on the weaponization of nuclear material would of course be
cause for international alarm]{.underline}, as it was in the case of
Iran and its secret program to develop a nuclear weapon. However,
[preventing proliferation in Saudi Arabia should focus first on
preventing enrichment and reprocessing capabilities,]{.underline} even
in the absence of work on a nuclear weapon. Nuclear suppliers should
reach consensus on not exacerbating security concerns in the Middle East
by agreeing not to sell Saudi Arabia sensitive fuel cycle capabilities.
Moreover, [Western governments should enhance their efforts to monitor,
detect,]{.underline} [and prevent the illicit spread of enrichment and
reprocessing capabilities to Saudi Arabia.]{.underline}

BRUCE JONES: [Let's turn to Iran.]{.underline} President Trump lived up
to his campaign promise to walk away from the Joint Comprehensive Plan
of Action. [Where does this leave Iran's nuclear program]{.underline}?
SUZANNE MALONEY: Despite the very significant economic penalty that
[Iran]{.underline} is paying for the reimposition of sanctions, it [is
continuing to abide by the terms of the]{.underline} [deal]{.underline}.
I think [this won't hold forever]{.underline}. To some extent, the
Iranians' patience is premised on a hope for changes in the American
domestic political situation that facilitate a return to the deal. I'm
skeptical about that, and I think inevitably the [Iranians can't hold on
until 2020 or longer]{.underline}. The precipitous decline in the value
of Iran's currency has exacted a political price in Tehran. There is a
shortage of consumer products, and diapers are now being rationed. [You
have that all transpiring at a time of real political uncertainty within
Iran]{.underline}. The gerontocracy is very quickly coming to a turning
point. We observe a lot of anticipation around succession for the
supreme leader, as well as the coming of age of the post-revolutionary
baby boom at a time when mobile phones are ubiquitous and people are
able to organize and express political grievances much more easily than
they were at any other point in recent history. There is a lot of
turmoil within Iran at a time when economic pressure is mounting. The
real question is whether the Iranians are going to try to take President
Trump up on his invitation to engage in a negotiation. It appears that
the president wants a bigger, better deal. He has been talking about
this since he was on the campaign trail. It is not entirely clear
whether the rest of his administration shares that objective or believes
that it is realistic. The State Department has a new office that appears
to be focused exclusively on ramping up economic pressure on Iran. There
is a lot of support in the administration for a strategy that emphasizes
regime change. FOREIGN POLICY at BROOKINGS 11 MANAGING RISK: NUCLEAR
WEAPONS IN THE NEW GEOPOLITICS [Iran is caught between a rock and a hard
place---negotiating with a partner who has not proven reliable and with
whom they have long-standing mistrust and antipathy, or trying to muddle
through, wait out the American political calendar, and hope that they
can forestall this mounting internal economic and political
pressure]{.underline}. ROBERT EINHORN: I think there is a common thread
that runs through the current administration's approach to North Korea
and Iran: wildly unrealistic objectives and expectations. There is
tremendous pressure on Iran's economy, exacerbating Iran's current
economic difficulties, but I don't think renewed sanctions will turn out
to be as devastating as the previous rounds in 2012 and 2013. And they
won't be enough to force Iran to accept Secretary Mike Pompeo's 12
demands on Iran's regional behavior, nuclear program, and domestic
behavior.1 The not-so-hidden agenda of many in the current
administration is not really to negotiate a better deal; it's to
destabilize the regime. It is therefore unlikely the Iranians will take
up President Trump's offer to engage in negotiations. BRUCE JONES: [How
seriously should we take the risk of further proliferation in the region
if we continue on the current path?]{.underline} [I'm thinking about
Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates]{.underline}, in particular.
SUZANNE MALONEY: I'm relatively skeptical, in part based on a study that
Bob Einhorn and Richard Nephew published in May 2016.2 I think it still
holds true, despite the rhetoric we hear from some of our long-standing
partners in the region. They simply don't have the technological
wherewithal to move quickly toward a serious nuclear weapons program.
ROBERT EINHORN: I also remain skeptical, but [Saudi Arabia draws the
most concern because it is the most motivated to achieve a nuclear
capability]{.underline}. Senior Saudis have talked about matching
whatever Iran does in this area. But they lack an indigenous human and
physical infrastructure. Many people assume that Pakistan will somehow
assist the Saudi program, but I don't believe that, especially now that
Pakistan is seeking much better relations with Iran. Still, **[Saudi
intentions depend, to some extent, on the role of the United
States]{.underline}**. [The Saudis were horrified when President Obama
walked back from his red line on using military force in response to the
Syrian use of chemical weapons. Since then, signals by the Trump
administration about reducing the American military presence in the
region have reinforced for senior Saudi officials the idea that they
need more strategic independence. Hence we've seen Saudi Arabia
establish relationships with Russia and others in recent
years.]{.underline}

[The Gulf states]{.underline}, notably Saudi Arabia, [were initially not
convinced that nuclear negotiations would lead to a successful
outcome]{.underline}. Nevertheless, [these nations endorsed the Nuclear
Deal after being persuaded that it would severely constrain Iran from
acquiring a nuclear weapon and that sanctions lifted would be \"snapped
back\" if Iran violated the agreement]{.underline}. After attending the
summit, Saudi King Salman described the Nuclear Deal as a turning point
in strategic relations between the two allies.11 In the official Joint
Summit Statement, the participants \"affirmed their strong support for
the efforts of the P5+1 to reach a deal with Iran \... that would
verifiably ensure that Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon, noting
that such a deal would represent a significant contribution to regional
security.\"12 [When the JCPOA]{.underline} went into effect, Saudi
Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said, \"[Now we have one less problem
for the time being to deal with,\" Iran\'s nuclear
threat.13]{.underline} Notwithstanding the successful negotiation of the
Nuclear Deal, many U.S. [officials have been losing sleep over the
thought that the Saudi leadership might acquire nuclear weapons **for
the purpose of countering Iran\'s deployment** of them once the special
terms of the agreement start to expire in 10 years]{.underline}. At
least in theory, [the kingdom could develop nuclear weapons within a
decade as a spinoff of its planned peaceful nuclear-energy
program.]{.underline} As a practical matter, however, this would pose an
almost insurmountable challenge, given the lack of Saudi technical
knowhow and manufacturing capabilities. Additionally, such an effort
would put the kingdom at risk of the IAEA\'s detecting such a program in
violation of Riyadh\'s nuclear nonproliferation treaty (NPT)
commitment.14 [Even more worrisome is the prospect that the Saudis might
acquire nuclear weapons in the near term to hedge against Tehran\'s
abrogating the Nuclear Deal in a few years, after the bulk of the
sanctions have been lifted]{.underline}.15 For either purpose, [the
Saudi leadership could seek to purchase nuclear arms from a nation like
North Korea or possibly Pakistan]{.underline}.16 These would be dramatic
and dangerous actions, warranting an immediate demarche by the president
to the Saudi king if there were any indications that Riyadh was
considering such options. Meanwhile, almost 7,000 miles away, Saudi
Arabia and its GCC partners have continued to worry that Washington
would view closing the Nuclear Deal as an important step in building
improved relationships with the Iranian leadership, putting at risk the
longstanding relationship with the Gulf states. [When the JCPOA was
signed]{.underline}, leaders of [the Gulf nations expressed concern that
the United States will now \"no longer have their back, \... abandoning
them in hopes of allying with their nemesis, Iran.\"]{.underline}17
**[These and other such anxieties underscore the need for the United
States to ensure that its security relationship with the Gulf states is
rock solid,]{.underline}** especially the nuclear guarantee that
represents the cornerstone of our overall commitment. In the latest
Posture Statement, [the Secretary of Defense]{.underline} implicitly
[tries to assuage Gulf states\' concerns]{.underline} regarding their
relationship with the United States [by affirming the commitment and
capabilities]{.underline} \"to deter aggression and bolster the security
of our friends and allies in the Middle East region, ...**[strengthening
the regional security architecture in a way that blunts Iran\'s ability
to coerce its neighbors]{.underline}**.\"18 He goes on to explain that
this architecture requires the United States to maintain \"tens of
thousands of American personnel ashore and afloat in the region, along
[with]{.underline} our [most sophisticated ground, maritime, and air and
ballistic missile defense assets]{.underline}, \[\...helping\] [us stay
ahead of the risks posed by Iran\'s ballistic missiles, naval forces,
cyber capabilities, and support for terrorists and others in the
region]{.underline}.\"19 While calming some concerns with these
assurances, of particular interest to the Gulf states is the credibility
of our nuclear security guarantees as represented by our \"nuclear
umbrella.\"

[Between]{.underline} potentially [mishandling the Iran Nuclear
Deal]{.underline}, [and **alienating the burgeoning nuclear power
programs in the Middle East, the United States risks bungling an
opportunity to direct the region's nuclear future**]{.underline} and,
instead, [might cede that leadership to Russia, China or South Korea.
Saudi Arabia is looking to acquire nuclear technology in the form of a
civilian nuclear power program.]{.underline} Which sounds good - similar
to what the United Arab Emirates is doing. Since actual nuclear power
has nothing to do with weapons, that's great. [However, Saudi Arabia
considers itself the Sunni Leader in the world and a bulwark against
Iran, which considers itself the Shia leader in the world. The Saudis
will not restrict themselves in any way nuclear relative to
Iran]{.underline}. Which means uranium enrichment and maybe reprocessing
of used nuclear fuel. If the White House does not extend sanctions
waivers under the Iran Nuclear Deal by the May 12 deadline, things will
get very complicated. The Deal could fall apart, the United States might
try to re-impose sanctions unilaterally without the support of Europe or
Asia, and would push our allies and adversaries into a complex Q&A of
'Will Iran restart its nuclear weapons program?' or 'Who gets Iranian
oil?' or 'Who keeps doing business with U.S. banks?' [The Iran Nuclear

leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, seems not afraid to take bold
actions. [Which makes America's role thorny. We're not supposed to
support a country's civilian nuclear power program if it looks like they
will also build a nuclear weapons program]{.underline}. For seventy
years, America has strongly regulated trade in nuclear materials,
equipment, and technology to deter, limit or slow the possible use of
these materials, which were designed for peaceful purposes, to help make
nuclear weapons. [Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, which has no nuclear power
plants, [plans to construct sixteen reactors over the next 25
years]{.underline}. The Kingdom has solicited bids for the first two
reactors (small modular reactors from Argentina and Korea) and hopes to
sign contracts by the end of this year. American nuclear companies are
looking to bid on the upcoming larger multibillion-dollar projects. In
February, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry led an interagency delegation
to London to discuss a nuclear agreement with Khalid Bin Abdulaziz
Al-Falih, the Saudi Arabian Minister of Energy and Industry. **[It would
be a huge loss if the United States did not have a large role in the
Saudis' nuclear future given our lead in safety and all-things
nuclear.]{.underline}** Last month, Sharon Squassoni from the Elliott
School of International Affairs at George Washington University,
testified before the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs on the 'The
Implications of Nuclear Cooperation with Saudi Arabia' and summed up the
pros and cons of partnering with Saudi Arabia. Squassoni points out that
the risk of misuse of American material, equipment and technology is
minimized by the stringent requirements for approving these agreements
as provided for in the 1978 Nuclear Nonproliferation Act which amended
the 1954 Atomic Energy Act, requiring, among other things, a range of
safeguards, assurances and consents against using any of the materials
or technologies in a nuclear explosive device or for any other military
purpose. Another way to reduce risks is through coordinating export
controls among the main suppliers. Over time, the Nuclear Suppliers
Group, made up of nations supplying various components of the fuel
cycle, has incorporated several of these nonproliferation elements in
its guidelines for harmonizing trade among different countries. While
American agreements are typically the most restrictive, a nuclear
cooperation agreement with the United States is essential for other
suppliers if their equipment contains American components, designs or
technologies. But according to Squassoni, [some countries see value in
negotiating an agreement with the United States not just for trade but
because it allows leverage and access to broader nuclear commerce within
the privileged nuclear group]{.underline}. The dominance of the U.S.
nuclear industry has not yet faded entirely, giving United States
nuclear cooperation agreements more leverage than they might otherwise
have. However, sovereignty rights loom as an issue with weapons of any
kind, especially for those countries that fear attack by their enemies
or being subsumed by larger players like the United States, China or
Russia. Countries like the UAE have renounced acquiring sensitive
nuclear fuel cycle technologies like uranium enrichment and spent fuel
reprocessing that build capabilities useful to weapons. Saudi Arabia is
reluctant to do so, especially since Iran can still enrich uranium, even
if only to low levels. Then just last week, a bipartisan group of former
national security officials and nonproliferation experts, including
eminent figures such as Dr. Sig Hecker, Ambassador Linton Brooks and Dr.
Pete Lyons, submitted a letter to Congress on this issue. They argued
that, for national security reasons, it is in our best interests to have
a nuclear cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia, even if it does not
contain the same enrichment and reprocessing prohibitions found in the
2009 agreement with the United Arab Emirates. Hanging over the issue is
the Nuclear Deal between Iran and the United States, Great Britain,
France, Germany, China and Russia, known as the P5+1 Group, negotiated
in 2015. This Deal has been a general success but has led to a shift in
regional tensions. [The Saudis were never as concerned with Iran's
nuclear ambitions as they've been with what they see as Iran's regional
goal of hegemony and their use of terrorism and subversion to achieve
it.]{.underline} [Iran's role in the civil wars in Yemen and Syrian are
exactly the thing Riyadh was worried about, not a nuclear
bomb.]{.underline} Since the Iran Nuclear Deal never dealt with these
other problems, the Saudis feel that [the Deal makes the situation
worse]{.underline}. [Lifting sanctions against Iran removed Iran's
status as a rogue state and gave it more income and legitimacy to meddle
in regional conflicts]{.underline}. Our destruction of Iraq, and its
spawning of ISIS, just helped Iran become a bigger problem. Enter Donald
Trump. In theory, Mr. Trump is well-suited to push the Saudis to accept
our standards of nonproliferation and adherence to strict limits on
nuclear technology. He can reaffirm Saudi Arabia's position under our
nuclear umbrella. He can argue that it makes more sense for Riyadh to
buy enriched fuels for the reactors from the lower-cost foreign
suppliers in the Nuclear Suppliers Group than it is to produce it in
Saudi Arabia. Any such agreement would strengthen our relationship with
the Kingdom. But there are questions about what limits the Trump
administration would require, and what the Saudis would accept, as part
of any agreement. Insisting on strict conditions could force the Saudis
to buy from Russia or China instead, which don't impose the same rules,
or from France or South Korea. The biggest take-away from Squassoni\'s
testimony is [the U.S. has always had an unwritten policy of restricting
enrichment and reprocessing in countries in the Middle
East.]{.underline} If it doesn\'t do this with Saudi Arabia, it will be
breaking that policy. Failure to incorporate crucial restrictions in any
deal would leave the Saudis free to repurpose some of the technology for
nuclear weapons. That would undercut decades of American-led efforts to
prevent exactly this problem. But then, [continued adherence to the Iran
Nuclear Deal is the obvious test of whether we'll undercut decades of
American leadership.]{.underline} This is a text book example of the
intersection of science and society, but **[if the Saudis get nuclear,
it would be better if it was with us.]{.underline}**

#### US-Saudi Alliance key to stop nuclear Arms-racing---arms sales are vital

Second, U.[S. military power is finite, and both the United States and
Saudi Arabia face rapidly changing threats]{.underline}. [The United
States needs allies that have interoperable forces that can both fight
effectively alongside the United States and ease the U.S. burden by
defending themselves]{.underline}. Iran already poses a massive
asymmetric naval-air-assault force threat to the Gulf states. [The U.S.
invasion of Iraq has left Iraqi forces a decade away from being a
counterbalance to Iran;]{.underline} [Saudi Arabia is the only
meaningful regional power to work with. Additionally, al-Qaeda in the
peninsula is based in Yemen, and the threat of terrorism and outside
infiltration means highly mobile Saudi forces are critical to the
security of Saudi energy and civil facilities]{.underline}. Helping
Saudi Arabia create a combination of effective air and naval power also
helps ensure the security of tanker and other shipping in the Gulf of
Oman and a steadily more unstable Red Sea. \"The United States needs
allies that have interoperable forces that can both fight effectively

threat and may pose a nuclear one within the next three to five
years]{.underline}. [Upgrades of the Saudi Patriots create a base for an
integrated approach to air and missile defense.]{.underline} They lay
the groundwork for follow-on sales of advanced missile defense systems
like THAAD, and an emphasis on defense (not Saudi purchases of missiles
or nuclear systems). Coupled [with recent U.S. offers of \"extended
regional deterrence\" and the creation of a Saudi Air Force that is more
of a threat to Iran than Iran's conventional missiles are to Saudi
Arabia, they offer the best hope of both giving Saudi Arabia and other
Gulf states security and **stopping a nuclear arms race in the
region**.]{.underline}

[There is, however, at least one state that could receive significant
outside support: Saudi Arabia. And if it did, proliferation could
accelerate throughout the]{.underline} [region.]{.underline} Iran and
Saudi Arabia have long been geopolitical and ideological rivals. Riyadh
would face tremendous pressure to respond in some form to a
nuclear-armed Iran, not only to deter Iranian coercion and subversion
but also to preserve its sense that Saudi Arabia is the leading nation
in the Muslim world. [The Saudi government is already pursuing a nuclear
power capability, which could be the first step along a slow road to
nuclear weapons development. And concerns persist that it might be able
to accelerate its progress by exploiting its close ties to
Pakistan.]{.underline} During the 1980s, in response to the use of
missiles during the Iran-Iraq War and their growing proliferation
throughout the region, Saudi Arabia acquired several dozen css-2
intermediate-range ballistic missiles from China. The Pakistani
government reportedly brokered the deal, and it may have also oªered to
sell Saudi Arabia nuclear warheads for the css-2s, which are not
accurate enough to deliver conventional warheads eªectively. There are
still rumors that Riyadh and Islamabad have had discussions involving
nuclear weapons, nuclear technology, or security guarantees. [This
"Islamabad option" could develop in one of several different ways.
Pakistan could sell operational nuclear weapons and delivery systems to
Saudi Arabia, or it could provide the Saudis with the infrastructure,
material, and technical support they need to produce nuclear weapons
themselves]{.underline} within a matter of years, as opposed to a decade
or longer. Not only has Pakistan provided such support in the past, but
it is currently building two more heavy-water reactors for plutonium
production and a second chemical reprocessing facility to extract
plutonium from spent nuclear fuel. In other words, it might accumulate
more fissile material than it needs to maintain even a substantially
expanded arsenal of its own. Alternatively, Pakistan might oªer an
extended deterrent guarantee to Saudi Arabia and deploy nuclear weapons,
delivery systems, and troops on Saudi territory, a practice that the
United States has employed for decades with its allies. This arrangement
could be particularly appealing to both Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. It
would allow the Saudis to argue that they are not violating the npt
since they would not be acquiring their own nuclear weapons. And an
extended deterrent from Pakistan might be preferable to one from the
United States because stationing foreign Muslim forces on Saudi
territory would not trigger the kind of popular opposition that would
accompany the deployment of U.S. troops. [Pakistan]{.underline}, for its
part, [would gain]{.underline} financial benefits and international
clout by deploying nuclear weapons in Saudi Arabia, as well as
[strategic depth against its chief rival, India. The Islamabad option
raises a host of difficult issues, perhaps the most worrisome being
**how India would respond**]{.underline}. [Would it **target
Pakistan**]{.underline}'s weapons in Saudi Arabia with its own
conventional or nuclear weapons? [How would this expanded nuclear
competition influence **stability** during a crisis in either the Middle
East or South Asia?]{.underline} Regardless of India's reaction, [any
decision by the Saudi government to seek out nuclear weapons, by
whatever means, would be **highly destabilizing**. It would increase the
incentives of other nations in the Middle East to pursue nuclear weapons
of their own. And it could increase their ability to do so by eroding
the remaining barriers to nuclear proliferation]{.underline}: [each
additional state that acquires nuclear weapons **weakens the
nonprolif**]{.underline}eration **[regime]{.underline}**, even if its
particular method of acquisition only circumvents, rather than violates,
the npt. [Were Saudi Arabia to acquire nuclear weapons, the Middle East
would count three nuclear-armed states, and perhaps more before
long.]{.underline} It is unclear how such an n-player competition would
unfold because most analyses of nuclear deterrence are based on the
U.S.- Soviet rivalry during the Cold War[. It seems likely, however,
that the interaction among three or more nuclear-armed powers would be
more prone to **miscalc**]{.underline}ulation [and **escalation** than a
bipolar competitio]{.underline}n. During the Cold War, the United States
and the Soviet Union only needed to concern themselves with an attack
from the other.Multipolar systems are generally considered to be less
stable than bipolar systems because coalitions can shift quickly,
upsetting the balance of power and creating incentives for an attack.
[More important, emerging nuclear powers in the Middle East might not
take the costly steps necessary to preserve regional stability and avoid
a nuclear exchange.]{.underline} [For nuclear]{.underline}-armed
[states]{.underline}, **[the bedrock of deterrence]{.underline}**
[is]{.underline} the knowledge that each side has a [secure
second-strike]{.underline} capability, so that no state can launch an
attack with the expectation that it can wipe out its opponents' forces
and avoid a devastating retaliation. However, [**emerging nuclear powers
might not invest in**]{.underline} expensive but **[survivable
capabilities]{.underline}** such as hardened missile silos or
submarinebased nuclear forces. [Given this likely vulnerability, the
close proximity of states in the Middle East, and the very short flight
times of ballistic missiles in the region, any new nuclear powers might
be compelled to "launch on warning" of an attack or even, during a
crisis, to use their nuclear forces preemptively. Their governments
might also delegate launch authority to lower-level commanders,
heightening the possibility of miscalculation and
escalation.]{.underline} Moreover, if early warning systems were not
integrated into robust command-and-control systems, the risk of an
unauthorized or accidental launch would increase further still. And
without sophisticated early warning systems, a nuclear attack might be
unattributable or attributed incorrectly. [That is, assuming that the
leadership of a targeted state survived a first strike, it might not be
able to accurately determine which nation was responsible. And this
uncertainty, when combined with the pressure to respond quickly, would
create a significant risk that it would retaliate against the wrong
party, potentially trigger]{.underline}ing **[a regional nuclear
war]{.underline}.** Most existing nuclear powers have taken steps to
protect their nuclear weapons from unauthorized use: from closely
screening key personnel to developing technical safety measures, such as
permissive action links, which require special codes before the weapons
can be armed. Yet there is no guarantee that [emerging nuclear
powers]{.underline} would be willing or able to implement these
measures, [creating a significant risk that their governments might lose
control over the weapons or nuclear material and that nonstate actors
could gain access to these items]{.underline}. Some states might seek to
mitigate threats to their nuclear arsenals; for instance, they might
hide their weapons. In that case, however, a single intelligence
compromise could leave their weapons vulnerable to attack or theft.

One of the most persistent myths about U.S. foreign policy is the idea
that America desires---due to greed, messianic ideological impulses, or
simple imperial presumptions---to dominate the Middle East. In reality,
[American policy has long been torn by two conflicting imperatives: The
need to protect enduring U.S. interests, on the one hand, and the desire
to stay clear of the region's unending headaches, on the
othe]{.underline}r. Paul Wolfowitz
[remarked](https://books.google.com/books?id=wcljXYTZVnUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=rise+of+the+vulcans&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjMsZTm7M3gAhWhc98KHU7-AIAQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=sunlight&f=false)
once that his shift from focusing on the Middle East to working on East
Asia was like "walking out of some oppressive, stuffy room into sunlight
and fresh air." To borrow the metaphor, American officials have long
desired to walk toward the sunlight---while understanding that they
cannot fully escape the darkness. Today, [calls for the United States to
disengage militarily from the Middle East are commonplace]{.underline}.
Those calls reflect deep frustration with the travails of American
interventions over the past two decades, as well as the
belief---entirely correct---that the United States faces greater
challenges elsewhere. [Yet U.S. interests in the region have not
disappeared, and the prospect that Middle Eastern troubles will impact
America if left unattended is as high as ever]{.underline}. **[If the
United States rushes for the exits, it may find that it is pulled back
under worse circumstances, and at higher costs, in the
future]{.underline}**. President Trump is giving voice to a powerful and
understandable urge to cut cleanly and get out of the Middle East. The
best approach, however, may be one that reflects America's longstanding
ambivalence about the region. The [interests that have long kept the
United States involved in the Middle East are fairly clear]{.underline}.
Coming out of World War II, American strategists resolved that [the
United States must prevent any hostile force from dominating a region of
critical geopolitical or geo-economic significance]{.underline}. The
Middle East, with its vast oil reserves, certainly fit that description.
True, America never got a particularly large portion of its oil from
Middle Eastern sources. But its allies did: "The Marshall Plan for
Europe,"
[noted](https://books.google.com/books?id=nGqoAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA267&dq=what+good+is+grand+strategy+middle+east+oil+forrestal&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjM7JyJ7c3gAhWKc98KHXGRAg0Q6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=what%20good%20is%20grand%20strategy%20middle%20east%20oil%20forrestal&f=false)
Truman's first Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal, "could not succeed
without access to the Middle East oil." Moreover, the fact that oil was
traded on a global market meant that a disruption of price or supply in
one region would cause disruption on a far larger scale. At present, the
United States is again becoming a net energy exporter and a swing
producer in the global oil market. Yet [so long as the countries of the
Middle East sit atop huge energy reserves that confer great wealth and
power on whoever controls it, the strategic importance of the Middle
East]{.underline}---[and the imperative of keeping it out of hostile
hands---will remain.]{.underline} Other issues have also kept the United
States engaged. Since the 1970s, America has had a critical interest in
preventing or combating international terrorism, much of which emerges
from the Middle East[. American policymakers have been properly
concerned with confronting aggression against friendly nations and
preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction to rogue states or
non-state actors]{.underline}. [Then there is the American interest in
promoting peace, democracy, and human rights in the Middle East---one
that has never been as important as the other U.S. interests, that has
affected how even the most cynical, "realist" administrations have
approached the region.]{.underline} Over a period of decades, these
issues have exerted a strong gravitational pull on American policy,
making it impossible for U.S. officials to ignore the region. And yet
American policymakers have often been equally aware of the problems that
U.S. engagement presents. The situation in the Middle East, Dean Acheson
once
[commented](https://books.google.com/books?id=nGqoAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA55&dq=what+good+is+grand+strategy+karl+marx&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiUjKb77M3gAhWNmeAKHQXeDNMQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&q=what%20good%20is%20grand%20strategy%20karl%20marx&f=false),
"might have been devised by Karl Marx himself." A combination of stunted
development, stifling socio-political conditions, and resentment of
foreign influence made the region ripe for radicalism and inherently
difficult for outside powers to manage. Getting deeply involved in the
Middle East ran the risk of making America the target of that radicalism
and anger; it also ran the risk of distracting the United States from
other areas where the prospects for constructive change seemed more
promising. The Middle East, Wolfowitz
[lamented](https://books.google.com/books?id=wcljXYTZVnUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=rise+of+the+vulcans&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjMsZTm7M3gAhWhc98KHU7-AIAQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=sunlight&f=false),
was an area "where people only know how to create problems." The result
has been a perpetual tension: The Middle East might require American
attention and management, but it was also a source of dangers and
distractions that most U.S. officials would have been just as happy to
avoid. This tension has been omnipresent as the U.S. role in the Middle
East has expanded since the 1970s, following the British withdrawal from
the region. During the late 1970s and 1980s, the United States [built
up](https://books.google.com/books?id=bKA9DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=making+the+unipolar+moment&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjsutKm7c3gAhXiYd8KHSzBAsgQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=making%20the%20unipolar%20moment&f=false)
the military capabilities necessary to prevent the Soviet Union (or
perhaps a hostile Iran) from dominating the region. During the Iran-Iraq
War, the Reagan administration supported Saddam Hussein as a bulwark
against Tehran's influence. But at the same time, the United States
refrained from a significant "onshore" military presence in the Persian
Gulf out of fear of inciting terrorist attacks, offending local
sensitivities, or discrediting friendly regimes. Once the Iran-Iraq War
ended, American military capabilities started flowing out of the region,
to be refocused on other priorities. That trend was reversed after
Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait prompted a massive, U.S.-led
intervention to restore the regional balance of power, as well as a
persistent post-conflict military presence to keep an eye on Saddam's
wounded but still dangerous regime. As early as 1990-91, however, U.S.
officials had been deeply
[ambivalent](https://books.google.com/books?id=bKA9DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=making+the+unipolar+moment&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjsutKm7c3gAhXiYd8KHSzBAsgQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=making%20the%20unipolar%20moment&f=false)
about the idea of permanently stationing American forces in Saudi Arabia
or other Gulf countries. They worried that such a presence might make
American forces the target of terrorist groups that opposed
authoritarian governments in the Persian Gulf---warnings that seemed
vindicated when al-Qaeda began taking aim at U.S. targets in the region
and far beyond. The 9/11 attacks offered evidence that the Middle East's
problems could reach out and touch the United States in disastrous ways.
The George W. Bush administration responded with the massive projection
of American power into the region, focused on defeating al-Qaeda,
toppling hostile governments in Afghanistan and Iraq, birthing stable
democracies, and thereby transforming the region for the better. When
that project proved vastly more costly and difficult than expected, the
Obama administration sought to limit U.S. engagement in the region as a
way of husbanding resources, avoiding blowback, and "pivoting" to more
promising areas. Yet even Obama, so skeptical of American intervention
in the region, was unable to get out entirely: The persistent threat of
terrorism compelled continuing engagement in Afghanistan; humanitarian
concerns triggered military action in Libya; the U.S. withdrawal from
Iraq and inaction in Syria contributed to a regional meltdown that
ultimately compelled re-intervention to deal with a new and terrifying
threat from ISIS. The story of American policy in the Middle East has
been one of engagement---sometimes remarkably intensive and violent
engagement---but also one of recurring ambivalence about that
engagement. Today, the [Trump]{.underline} administration [is
manifesting]{.underline} the same [ambivalence]{.underline}. The
president reportedly referred to Syria as a country offering only "sand
and death," and he announced plans for a complete withdrawal of U.S.
troops. [Trump appears to be eyeing the exits in
Afghanistan]{.underline} as well. But at the same time, a familiar set
of factors is making other U.S. officials reluctant to countenance a
broad withdrawal. The U.S. intelligence community has warned that a
complete pullout from Afghanistan could lead to a major terrorist attack
on the American homeland within two years. [There are also concerns that
American retrenchment would open the door for hostile
actors]{.underline}---Iran and Russia---[to exert dominant influence in
a region that still matters]{.underline}. Trump is a most unorthodox
president, but he faces the same dilemma that has long afflicted U.S.
policy in the Middle East. Indeed, that dilemma may explain why the
president---after insisting for months that the United States would
withdraw entirely from Syria, just recently indicated that a token
American force might remain. [So what can this history tell us about how
to proceed today?]{.underline} Three key points are in order. First,
there is a critical need to meter U.S. involvement in the Middle East.
This is not simply because large-scale interventions have proven so
unrewarding over the past two decades. It is also because the need to
confront other, more important issues---namely the threats posed by
China and Russia---is undeniable. There is a finite amount of resources,
time, and political will the United States can devote to foreign policy
issues. And when Washington overcommits to a region as frustrating as
the Middle East, it risks undermining public support for U.S. foreign
policy not just in that region but around the world. If the United
States goes big in the Middle East, it will sooner or later face strong
pressures to go home. Second, however[, it is a fantasy to think that
the United States can disengage from the Middle East without
consequence]{.underline}. This is because [America still has pressing
interests in that region]{.underline}---and because those interests are
as unlikely to protect themselves today as they ever have been in the
past. **[Growing Russian influence, Iran's hegemonic ambitions, the
potential resurgence of key terrorist organizations, and the massive
political instability and violence that plagues large swaths of the
region are real problems that demand competent
management]{.underline}**. [America's partners in the region can do more
to manage those problems than they have done to date, but they remain
manifestly incapable of doing so without significant U.S.
support.]{.underline} Third, hasty withdrawals are likely to be followed
by hasty re-engagements. After the United States left Iraq in 2011, the
state nearly collapsed, ISIS surged to prominence, and an emergency
military intervention---which has now lasted nearly five years---was
needed to repair the damage. If the United States disengages from Syria
and Afghanistan today and the result is a significant terrorist attack,
the pressure to get back into the region and take decisive military
action will be strong indeed---even if that means shortchanging other
geopolitical priorities. If America goes home from the Middle East, it
will sooner or later face pressures to go big. Whatever policies the
Trump administration pursues in the Middle East, then, [the United
States will continue to face the same conflicting imperatives that have
long shaped its approach to that region. America will be drawn toward
the Middle East by enduring interests and pressing threats]{.underline}.
[But it will be tempted to depart the region because of the dangers and
costs U.S. engagement causes.]{.underline} In these circumstances, [a
responsible strategy would focus on minimizing the dangers and costs of
engagement by suppressing the most serious threats at the lowest
expenditure of resources. This]{.underline} [might entail using a select
subset of capabilities]{.underline}---**[special operations forces,
tactical airpower, support for local forces]{.underline}**---[to keep
the pressure]{.underline} [on the most dangerous terrorist groups and
prevent them from mounting major external attacks]{.underline}. (This
was, in essence, the strategy the United States was following prior to
Trump's Syria withdrawal announcement.) Likewise, [it might focus on
empowering---with]{.underline} intelligence, diplomatic, and [military
support---anti-Iran actors in the region and thereby maintaining a
tolerable balance of power]{.underline}. In Afghanistan, this might mean
continuing to push for a negotiated peace deal, but only with adequate
assurances that an American withdrawal would not turn that country into
a terrorist playground---and without telegraphing a near-term retreat
that will only make such assurances harder to obtain. [The worst
strategies,]{.underline} by contrast, [would be those that skew toward
the extremes of deeper engagement or precipitate
withdrawal]{.underline}, [inviting some adverse development that would
cause an overcorrection in the future]{.underline}. "Muddle through" is
rarely the sort of advice that wins a lot of applause. But it may be the
best approach to managing America's continuing strategic ambivalence
about the Middle East.

including intelligence activities, conventional arms sales, and
especially security agreements and alliances, **[that have been arguably
the most important and consequential of the strategies of
inhibition]{.underline}**.78 Two features of U.S. grand strategy in the
postwar period stand out. First is **[the United States' deep set of
sprawling military alliances and security guarantees]{.underline}**.
Second is **[the extraordinarily forward-leaning and, at times,
preemptive nature of its military strategy]{.underline}**. Neither
policy has antecedents in U.S. pre-nuclear history. Before 1950 the
United States had always gone to great lengths to avoid entangling
alliances, deploying forces abroad, or maintaining large military forces
during peacetime.79 Nor can the containment mission, which has often
been defensive, fully explain these policies.80 Both, however, have been
key elements of the strategies of inhibition. As the Cold War
confrontation with the Soviet Union emerged, **[the United States
entered into a series of alliances and provided explicit and implicit
security guarantees to a range of countries]{.underline}**. **[The most
famous was the North Atlantic Treaty, signed in 1949, which later
developed into a full-scale, integrated military
alliance]{.underline}**.81 **[There were also regional treaties, such as
the 1951 ANZUS agreements with Australia and New Zealand; bilateral
treaties with Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan; and implicit, secret
arrangements with Sweden]{.underline}**. As time went on, **[a key
element of these arrangements was to connect the military capabilities
of the United States, particularly its nuclear forces, to the defense of
these countries]{.underline}**. **[This "nuclear umbrella" was designed
to help deter and defend against the Soviet Union, and was a key element
of the containment strategy]{.underline}**. **[These security
arrangements also served another purpose: to inhibit the protected state
from seeking its own nuclear weapons]{.underline}**. As Bruno Tetrais
demonstrates, **[security guarantees "have proven to be a very effective
instrument in preventing States from going nuclear."]{.underline}**82 Or
as Jeffrey Knopf has argued, **["\[S\]ecurity assurances are an integral
part of the nuclear nonproliferation regime."]{.underline}**83
**[Countries that had the capabilities and occasionally the interest in
acquiring independent nuclear forces---including Australia, Sweden,
Japan, and West Germany---might feel reassured by the U.S. nuclear
umbrella and eschew their own weapons (and they might be reminded from
time to time how reassured they should feel)]{.underline}**.84 **[These
security arrangements]{.underline}** have continued and even expanded
since the end of the Cold War.85 And although they are no longer needed
to contain an adversary such as the Soviet Union, **[they still serve to
inhibit nuclear proliferation]{.underline}**. Writ large, **[these
security arrangements in the nuclear age are unlike traditional,
pre-nuclear age alliances, which tended to be threat specific, additive,
and temporary]{.underline}**. **[With some exceptions, they have been
suppressive and vague, and have lasted for decades, even after the
original threat that spawned the alliance had
disappeared]{.underline}**. In some cases, where the inhibition aspect
looms larger, **[it might be better to think of the United States and
its clients as "frenemies" rather than as traditional
allies]{.underline}**.86 How does the United States' nuclear strategy
play into its inhibition mission? The efforts of the United States to
achieve and maintain nuclear primacy during the early Cold War are well
known.87 Many nuclear strategists claimed that when the United States
and the Soviet Union approached numerical parity in the middle of the
1960s, it would have been unwise for the United States to spend
extraordinary sums on counterforce nuclear capabilities that made sense
only as part of a so-called damage limitation strategy. Robert Jervis
asserted that the United States' damage limitation nuclear strategies
"did not come to grips with fundamental characteristics of nuclear
politics," were "incoherent," and "conjured up unrealistic dangers"
while "ignoring real problems."88 Once mutual nuclear vulnerability
between adversaries was achieved, Jervis, Waltz, and others have argued,
fighting and winning a nuclear war would be illogical: therefore,
efforts to achieve "nuclear superiority" would be pointless. Despite the
claims of advocates of the nuclear revolution, the United States spent
tremendous sums on missile accuracy and speed, tracking Soviet nuclear
submarines while improving the acoustic quieting capabilities of U.S.
submarines, hardening American nuclear targets, and increasing U.S.
intelligence and defensive capabilities against nuclear weapons. Keir
Lieber and Daryl Press have described how **[the United States
vigorously pursued a "counterforce revolution" that produced far more
accurate missiles and the potential for a first-strike
capability]{.underline}**.89 Austin Long and Brendan Green have
demonstrated that the United States strove to meet the two greatest
challenges to threatening the survivability of Soviet strategic nuclear
forces---being able to locate and track both Soviet mobile missiles and
Soviet nuclear submarines. The United States never accepted the notion
of mutual vulnerability with the Soviets and worked hard to overcome
it.90 There were times in the late 1970s and 1980s that the Soviets
appeared to fear that the United States was interested in and could
someday reach meaningful nuclear superiority.91 Some analysts believe it
has achieved nuclear primacy vis-à-vis China and Russia today.92 The
U.S. drive for nuclear primacy likely had many causes, the most
important of which was a desire to achieve coercive leverage vis-à-vis
the Soviets in the past and perhaps over Russia and China today.
**[Pursuing nuclear primacy]{.underline}**, however, **[has two
important consequences for the inhibition mission]{.underline}**. First,
**[accurate counterforce combined with better intelligence and defense
could nullify the effect of small, less sophisticated nuclear
forces]{.underline}**. **[By making the bar for building a meaningful
nuclear force so high, the United States might also be able to dissuade
potential proliferants from building forces it could easily make
obsolete]{.underline}**. **[If states did build these forces, their
vulnerability to a U.S. first strike removed at least some of their
deterrent power vis-à-vis the United States and its allies under the
U.S. nuclear umbrella]{.underline}**. Second, by not embracing mutual
vulnerability, **[by pursuing a counterforce (and even a preemptive)
strategy, the United States has made its commitment to defend its
nonnuclear allies more credible]{.underline}**. **[If the United States
had accepted nuclear parity with the Soviet Union, few patron states
would have believed its promise to defend them while risking their own
nuclear annihilation]{.underline}**. **[In such a case, the pressure on
the nuclear state to acquire an independent deterrent would have been
strong]{.underline}**.

**[If alliances are thus helpful in terms of the conflicts America
wages, they are more helpful still in terms of the conflicts they
prevent and the broader geostrategic influence they
confer]{.underline}**. Indeed, although the ultimate test of America's
alliances lies in their efficacy as warfighting coalitions, **[the most
powerful benefits they provide come in the normal course of peacetime
geostrategic management and competition]{.underline}**. First, **[US
alliances bind many of the richest and most militarily capable countries
in the world to Washington through enduring relationships of deep
cooperation]{.underline}**. Alliances reflect shared interests rather
than creating them, of course, and the United States would presumably
have close ties to countries such as the United Kingdom even without
formal alliances. But alliances nonetheless serve as "hoops of steel."
They help create a sense of permanence and shared purpose in key
relationships; they provide forums for regular interaction and
cooperation; they conduce to deeply institutionalized exchanges (of
intelligence, personnel, and other assets) that insulate and perpetuate
friendly associations even when political leaders clash.38 And
**[insofar as US alliances serve these purposes with respect to
immensely influential countries in Europe and the Asia-Pacific, they
help Washington preserve a significant overbalance of power vis-à-vis
any competitor]{.underline}**. Second, **[alliances have a strong
deterrent effect on would-be aggressors]{.underline}**. **[American
alliances lay down "redlines" regarding areas in which territorial
aggression is impermissible; they complicate the calculus of any
potential aggressor by raising the strong possibility that an attack on
a US ally will mean a fight with the world's most formidable
military]{.underline}**. **[The proposition that "defensive alliances
deter the initiation of disputes" is, in fact, supported by empirical
evidence, and the forward deployment of troops strengthens this
deterrence further still]{.underline}**.39 **[NATO clearly had an
important deterrent effect on Soviet calculations during the Cold
War]{.underline}**, for instance; more recently, **[Russia has behaved
most aggressively toward countries lacking US alliance guarantees
(Georgia and Ukraine), rather than toward those countries possessing
them]{.underline}** (the Baltic states or Poland). In other words,
**[alliances make the geostrategic status quo---which is enormously
favorable to the United States---far "stickier" than it might otherwise
be]{.underline}**. Third, and related to this second benefit,
**[alliances tamp down international instability more
broadly]{.underline}**. **[American security guarantees allow US allies
to underbuild their own militaries; while always annoying and
problematic when taken to extremes, this phenomenon also helps avert the
arms races and febrile security competitions that plagued Europe and
East Asia in earlier eras]{.underline}**. In fact, **[US alliances are
as useful in managing tensions among America's allies as they are in
constraining America's adversaries]{.underline}**. NATO was always
intended to keep the "Americans in" and the "Germans down" as well as
the "Russians out"; US presence, along with the creation of a framework
in which France and Germany were incentivized to cooperate rather than
compete with one another, would help stifle any resurgence of tensions
between these historical rivals.40 Similarly, **[US alliance guarantees
in the Asia-Pacific were designed, in part, to create a climate of
security in which Japan could be revived economically without
threatening its neighbors, just as the expansion of NATO after the Cold
War helped prevent incipient rivalries and territorial irredentism among
former members of the Warsaw Pact]{.underline}**.41 **[US alliances keep
things quiet in regions Washington cannot ignore, thereby fostering a
climate of peace in which America and its partners can
flourish]{.underline}**. Fourth, US **[alliances impede dangerous
geostrategic phenomena such as nuclear proliferation]{.underline}**. As
scholars such as Francis Gavin have emphasized, **[US security
guarantees and forward deployments have played a critical role in
convincing historically insecure, technologically advanced
countries---Germany, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, among others---to
forego possession of the world's absolute weapon]{.underline}**. In
several of these cases, moreover, **[the United States has used the
security leverage provided by alliance guarantees to dissuade allies
from pursuing the bomb after they had given indications of their intent
to start down that path]{.underline}**.42 If, as seems likely, a world
with more nuclear powers is likely to be a more dangerous world in which
crises more frequently take on a nuclear dimension and the risk of
nuclear conflict is higher, then the value of American alliances looms
large indeed. In sum, as the framers of the post-World War II order
understood, **[phenomena such as massive instability, arms racing, and
violence in key regions would eventually imperil the United States
itself]{.underline}**.43 **[Whatever modest reduction in short-term
costs might come from pursuing a "free hand" or isolationist strategy
was thus more than lost by the expense of fighting and winning a major
war to restore order]{.underline}**. Accordingly, **[America's peacetime
alliance system represents a cheaper, more prudent alternative for
maximizing US influence while also preventing raging instability by
deterring aggression and managing rivalries among
friends]{.underline}**. The fact that so many observers seem to have
forgotten why, precisely, America has alliances in the first place is an
ironic testament to just how well the system has succeeded.

Sometimes It's Not Dollars, But Sense As [others have pointed
out](https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/31148092/CaverleyHegemony.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&Expires=1553650705&Signature=GcE9Nx9bdQ6zJK7l9yJLS3WKbUg%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DUnited_States_Hegemony_and_the_New_Econo.pdf),
the United States can afford to "make economic \[...\] sacrifices" in
order to privilege politico-security benefits in arms export decisions.
As one [author recently explained in War on the
Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2018/04/americas-arms-sales-policy-security-abroad-not-jobs-at-home/):
[The United States is so economically advantaged in making and selling
weapons that it can limit conventional-weapons
proliferation]{.underline} \[and\] ... technology diffusion, (and
maintain a robust defense industrial base) [while retaining its
commanding market position. This is undoubtedly true]{.underline}.
However, on rare occasions economics do matter. Specifically,
maintaining strategic flexibility by keeping a production line open
which would otherwise shutter might sometimes need to be prioritized.
Consider the two recent examples of the F-22 and F-15. In December 2011,
the [final F-22 fighter
jet](https://www.ajc.com/business/final-rolls-out-marietta-plant/ayu0mRpAyscAvsjPo6YKwN/)
rolled off the assembly line, 554 short of the original program
requirement. At the same time, close [U.S. allies such as
Japan](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/RS22684.pdf) and [Australia made
inquiries](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-arms-usa-congress/senate-panel-seeks-end-to-f-22-export-ban-idUSTRE5896JU20090910)
about purchasing further increments of the fifth-generation fighter,
which would have kept production going for at least several more years.
The United States rejected the inquiries, shuttering the production line
instead. [A 2011 RAND Corporation
study](https://www.rand.org/pubs/technical_reports/TR831.html) estimates
the cost of restarting production and fabricating 75 additional F-22s to
be \$17 billion --- nearly \$227 million per jet. Despite this cost and
because of an evolving international security environment, the [US
Congress inserted language into the 2017 defense
budget](http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AS/AS25/20160420/104831/BILLS-114HR4909ih.pdf)
directing the U.S. Air Force to conduct a "production restart
assessment," though the likelihood of a [production restart remains
infinitesimally
small](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2017/06/21/the-f22-fighter-jet-restart-dead-study.html).
Fortunately, the outcome is different for the F-15. In 2013, [Qatar made
a request for the purchase of 70
F-15QAs](https://www.stripes.com/news/middle-east/us-fighter-jet-sales-to-gulf-allies-stalled-for-up-to-3-years-1.416467),
worth \$4 billion. At the time, without another export order the 40-year
old F-15 production line was [slated to close by
2019](https://www.defensenews.com/breaking-news/2016/09/28/white-house-approves-jet-sales-to-qatar-bahrain-and-kuwait-corker/),
eliminating any future purchases. After delaying approval for nearly
three years, the U.S. administration finally [approved the deal in late
2016](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-approves-sale-boeing-fighter-jets-qatar-kuwait-193835787--sector.html),
guaranteeing F-15 production into the mid-2020s. Unlike the F-22, the
United States maintains strategic flexibility in F-15 (and F-18 and
F-16) production, largely because of exports. This appears to be an
especially prescient decision, as the [FY2020 U.S. Air Force budget
proposal](https://www.saffm.hq.af.mil/Portals/84/documents/FY20/PROCUREMENT/FY20_PB_3010_Aircraft_Vol-1.pdf?ver=2019-03-18-152821-713)
requests money to purchase at least eight (and up to 100) F-15EX air
superiority platforms; a platform [one industry reporter
highlighted](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/26305/f-15x-will-come-in-two-variants-and-no-it-wont-cost-100m-per-copy)
"is only possible because other countries have spent roughly \$5B over
the last couple of decades to continuously evolve the F-15 into what it
is today \[...\] basically, the \[Air Force\] is getting \[these
upgrades\] for free." [What About Saudi Arabia? In sum,]{.underline}
[more restrictive arms sales, delivery suspensions, or outright embargos
are unlikely to succeed in policy coercion]{.underline}. While **[arms
transfers provide an avenue of influence, embargos often lead to
diversification]{.underline}**, not desired policy changes.
Additionally, [fears of technology transfer and direct offsets creating
a competitor out of every client are generally unfounded in the high-end
market in which the United States generally deals.]{.underline} Finally,
while the large domestic market provides the United States the luxury of
sacrificing financial gains for political influence, sometimes economics
do matter, particularly when it comes to saving a production line for
future flexibility. [These conclusions should therefore inform U.S.
policy on Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. The intent here is not to argue the
moral or ethical responsibility of U.S. leaders in responding to Saudi
Arabia's execution of journalists or tactics in the war in Yemen. It is
natural to see the horror wrought in Yemen and want to take any actions
necessary to stop it. However, [I ultimately argue against a Saudi
embargo.]{.underline} This is not because, as the [president has
argued](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/20/donald-trump-saudi-arabia-arms-sales-jamal-khashoggi)[,
it might cost a few billion dollars and some hundreds of defense
industry jobs.]{.underline} As others have pointed out, the [economic
impact of Saudi arms
purchases](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/12/opinion/saudi-arabia-arms-sales.html)
on the U.S. defense industry is relatively small. Rather, [**embargoing
Saudi Arabia is unlikely to fundamentally alter Saudi policies**, but
likely to further damage U.S. ties with Riyadh.]{.underline} In the
near-term, [Saudi Arabia can substitute other weapons]{.underline}, such
as [the Eurofighter and
Tornado](https://www.flightglobal.com/asset/26019/waf/), and "dumb
bombs" [instead of U.S.-built "smart weapons.]{.underline}" The Saudis
can also rely more heavily on their Emirati and Egyptian partners using
non-U.S. produced arms. In the medium to long term, such an embargo is
likely to push the Kingdom to greater arms diversification. If history
is any guide, [the United States will eventually lift any potential arms
embargo with little change in Saudi behavior, but only after having
provided an opportunity for adversary states such as Russia and China to
gain a strategic foothold in Riyadh. [Some might
counter](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/12/opinion/saudi-arabia-arms-sales.html)
that it would be extremely difficult and costly, in both time and money,
for the Saudis to significantly diversify their arms acquisitions away
from the United States]{.underline}. This is absolutely the case.
However, costly does not mean impossible. Less wealthy states have
already done it. Egypt is one example above; but others [such as
Venezuela](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/28/world/americas/28Venezuela.html?mtrref=www.google.com&gwh=BF08049671740FF1B83419CD83BABC0E&gwt=pay)
and even tiny Kuwait --- [frustrated at years of U.S. approval
delays](https://www.defensenews.com/home/2016/04/05/kuwait-signs-eurofighter-jet-deal/)
--- have significantly diversified their arms acquisitions. In other
words, [with the money and options available to Saudi Arabia, and [few
other
producers](https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/22/middleeast/arms-exports-saudi-arabia-intl/index.html)
showing a stomach for a full embargo, it is not unreasonable to believe
that the Saudis might significantly diversify their arms acquisitions
over time in response to a U.S. embargo]{.underline}. Thus, [while a
U.S. embargo might be morally compelling and emotionally satisfying, it
is unlikely to create meaningful change for those most at risk or be
strategically beneficial to the United States.]{.underline} In the
absence of a compelling, evidence-based case that an arms embargo on
Saudi Arabia might produce desired changes in behavior, policymakers
should look elsewhere for solutions to their Saudi problems.

### AT Esc Inev

#### US military alliances key to slow Saudi nuclear acquisition- if nukes are inev, it's just a question of from who and when

for National Security Studies (INSS) and head of its Arms Control and
Regional Security Program, 12-4-2018, \"Can the United States Prevent
Saudi Arabia from Getting Nuclear Weapons?,\" National Interest,
<https://nationalinterest.org/feature/can-united-states-prevent-saudi-arabia-getting-nuclear-weapons-37812>)
RK

[After having sought negotiations with previous U.S. administrations on
civilian nuclear cooperation, Saudi Arabia has recently renewed these
efforts with the Trump administration]{.underline}, for the development
of nuclear energy, power plants and desalination reactors. Negotiations
on a possible deal are ongoing, although according to a recent New York
Times article, [the administration refuses to say where things currently
stand. Saudi Arabia claims that it is seeking purely civilian
capabilities]{.underline}, but it has also insisted on retaining its
"right" to work on the fuel cycle and enrich uranium, [which can lay the
ground for a military nuclear capability in the years
ahead]{.underline}. However, it is also clear that the [Saudis' nuclear
plans are intimately tied to Iran's]{.underline}, and since 2010 Saudi
leaders have become more and more open about the fact that if Iran
attains nuclear weapons, they will quickly follow suit. The latest
statement was by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) in March 2018,
in the context of an interview to 60 Minutes. He noted that [while Saudi
Arabia does not want to acquire nuclear weapons, if Iran develops
nuclear weapons, so would Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. Generally speaking,
the [Iranian program has been a trigger for additional Gulf states to
establish or revitalize civilian nuclear programs. The United States has
always been very concerned about the proliferation risks involved in
nuclear cooperation]{.underline}, and in 2008 it was able to achieve a
memorandum of understanding with Saudi Arabia on nuclear energy
cooperation whereby the latter pledged to acquire nuclear fuel from
international markets, rather than producing it indigenously. But [ten
years later, it seems that Saudi Arabia no longer views itself as bound
by that understanding.]{.underline} The current challenge for the United
States is how to insist on what is known as a 123 agreement with Saudi
Arabia, meaning that the agreement explicitly denies Saudi Arabia the
right to work on sensitive nuclear technologies (enrichment capabilities
and plutonium reprocessing), without driving it into the hands of other
nuclear suppliers, such as Russia, China and South Korea, that may be
less worried about ensuring these restrictions. [There are concerns that
the Trump administration might be willing to concede to Saudi Arabia
sensitive capabilities]{.underline}, and the fact that it is not willing
to divulge information regarding the status of the negotiations does not
bode well in this regard. [The administration is keenly aware of the
link to Iran's nuclear posture, and that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of
Action (JCPOA) set a very negative precedent for nuclear cooperation
with other states when it legitimized Iran's enrichment
capabilities]{.underline}. While Iran must cap its stockpile of enriched
uranium for the duration of the deal, it is allowed---under the explicit
terms of the deal---to work on R&D into an entire range of advanced
centrifuges. Iran has plans to install and operate these centrifuges
eleven years into the deal. There is a real question of how these
capabilities can be denied to states like Saudi Arabia who are in good
standing with the NPT, whereas Iran---who blatantly violated the
nonproliferation treaty---was granted the right to continue with these
dangerous enrichment-related activities. [The dilemmas of nuclear
cooperation between the United States and Saudi Arabia have recently
come into sharper relief against the backdrop of the Jamal
Khashoggi]{.underline} murder at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last
month. This brutal murder, and the ensuing Saudi evasion has sparked a
major debate in the United States and around the world about the
reliability of MBS as a strategic partner. There are many calls in the
United States---from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress---for
the administration to not only punish Saudi Arabia for this gross
transgression, but to rethink its relations with the kingdom, and
certainly not to reward it with cooperation in the nuclear realm. [But
Saudi Arabia is not dependent solely on the United States for
cooperation in the nuclear realm. Will other potential suppliers be
willing to agree not to cooperate with Saudi Arabia unless it forsakes
sensitive nuclear technologies?]{.underline} Will they agree to set up a
supplier mechanism and insist that Saudi Arabia, and other states
seeking nuclear cooperation, can only buy fuel from this source? [With
lucrative deals on the table, it might prove difficult to garner this
kind of commitment. Moreover, there have long been suspicions that,
after Saudi Arabia financed Pakistan's nuclear program,]{.underline} [a
deal might have been struck whereby Pakistan will return the favor by
providing some kind of nuclear cover---whether by transferring
technologies directly to the kingdom or providing a nuclear umbrella
from Pakistan]{.underline}---[in Saudi Arabia's hour of
need]{.underline}. As such, the nonproliferation challenge remains,
whether or not the United States concludes a deal on civilian nuclear
cooperation. And if it is the United States that makes the deal, it can
insist that Saudi Arabia ratify the Additional Protocol (which would
grant the International Atomic Energy Administration additional
inspections rights), return spent fuel and generally supervise the
project. [Beyond attempts to deny Saudi Arabia technologies and
capabilities, it is important also to address Saudi motivation for going
nuclear.]{.underline} There is no doubt that Saudi Arabian concerns
focus on the Iranian nuclear threat; the kingdom's concern with Iran's
capabilities---as a motivation to go nuclear itself---is reflected in
the few explicit Saudi statements on the topic. [As long as the
motivation to go nuclear remains strong, states are likely to find a way
to develop capabilities, even if they have to pay a price for doing
so]{.underline}. In Iran's case, the major motivation for going nuclear
is to enhance its hegemonic power in the Middle East---a difficult
motivation to address. [But in the case of Saudi Arabia, if strong
international powers]{.underline}---the P5+1 and perhaps others---[were
to take a harsher stance on Iran's regional aggressions and missile
developments, and were to cooperate in order to improve the provisions
of the JCPOA, this would most likely have a direct and favorable impact
on Saudi Arabia's calculation of whether or not to develop nuclear
capabilities.]{.underline} Additionally, without minimizing the impact
of the crisis atmosphere surrounding the Khashoggi affair, it is
nevertheless important to consider whether significantly downgrading
ties with Saudi Arabia is the right way to go, from a proliferation
point of view. While this might not be the most opportune time to reward
the Saudi's desired nuclear cooperation, U.S. security guarantees to the
Saudis could be another route to lowering their motivation to achieve a
nuclear deterrent vis-à-vis Iran. [A decision by the U.S.
administration]{.underline} (or for that matter any other supplier) [to
allow Saudi Arabia to have enrichment capabilities will confront Israel
with a dilemma]{.underline}. [On the one hand it has been Israeli policy
to do its utmost to deny any neighboring country with whom it does not
have a peace treaty the means to acquire and develop a nuclear
program]{.underline}. [If Israel remains loyal to this approach, it
should seek to deny Saudi Arabia enrichment capabilities.]{.underline}
In practical terms this would imply making its opposition known in
Washington. On the other hand, [given the "tactical alliance" with Saudi
Arabia which has been triggered primarily by the common Iranian threat,
Israel could consider sacrificing its long term interest in denying
nuclear capabilities for the sake of its current interest in cultivating
relations with the Saudis]{.underline}. Israel should support the
traditional U.S. nonproliferation policies which allow states to have
access to nuclear fuel for civilian purposes, while denying them the
option of self production.

Then again, [if Iran acquitted nuclear weapons it might]{.underline},

"mutually assured destruction" might keep at least prevent a full-scale
military/naval confrontation with the US. America probably only has a
matter of months left before Iran becomes a fully-fledged, albeit minor,
nuclear power, securing its status as a regional superpower and
player]{.underline}. No amount of oil sanctions or drones or aircraft
carriers around the Strait of Hormuz will then alter that transcendent
fact, with US military strikes provoking unthinkable retaliation. [Iran

the two sides' differences]{.underline}. Watch more Trump's 'evidence'
of Iran's role in the Gulf attacks is dodgy Of course, [it will still be
appalling for the poor civilians in Yemen, Syria and elsewhere that have
been the victims of the proxy wars between Iran and its
allies]{.underline} (usually Russia and Turkey) [and
America's]{.underline} (the [Saudis]{.underline}, UAE, Israel and the
rest of the West). During the frostiest years of the Cold War between
the Soviet Union and the United States, their conflicts too were
pitilessly played out with other people\'s lives, from Angola to
Vietnam. [Proxy wars were fought, spy planes and civilian airliners were
periodically shot down by panicky air forces, spies arrested and
exchanged, and the ultimatums and tensions sometimes escalated to
terrifying heights]{.underline} (Cuba in 1962, Afghanistan in 1980).
Still, seeing as we are all still here, we never did perish in that
global thermonuclear conflict that we all once feared Kennedy and
Khrushchev, Reagan and Brezhnev would inflict on us. So [if nuclear
deterrence is good enough for the Russians and Americans, why not the
Iranians or the Saudis,]{.underline} and, for that matter, other
undeclared nuclear states such as Israel, India, Pakistan and, of
course, North Korea. [The irony is that an inter-state Middle East war
is less likely once everyone realises that Iran, and Israel and possibly
Saudi Arabia too have nuclear weapons and would, in certain
circumstances, use them]{.underline}. Much the same goes for why India
and Pakistan never quite go to war, despite all the crises, and shot
down planes and festering grievances. The back-channels open up, tempers
calm, and they always end up drawing back from the brink. Nuclear
weapons are an obscenity, but they have their uses.

rate of enrichment and even increased it more recently, so that in 10
days it will bypass the 300 kilogram limit," Iran's Atomic Energy
Organization spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi said on state TV, as quoted by
Reuters. "There is still time \... if European countries act." [Iran
would be exceeding its internationally-agreed enrichment cap of
3.67%,]{.underline} which is the amount allowed for civilian nuclear
power development. [Weapons-grade enrichment is 90%, but according to
nuclear experts, reaching 3 to 4% enrichment equates to roughly
two-thirds of the work done toward that 90% figure]{.underline}, [as any
increases beyond that seemingly small amount disproportionately speeds
up breakout time]{.underline}. [Tehran is threatening to roll back its
obligations under the nuclear deal a year after the Trump administration
withdrew from it and reimposed punishing sanctions on the Iranian
economy]{.underline}, most significantly its oil sector, the country's
largest source of revenue. The nuclear agreement, officially known as
the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action ([JCPOA), was meant to offer Iran
financial relief from sanctions in exchange for curbs to its nuclear
program]{.underline} and was signed under the Obama administration along
with the U.S., France, Germany, the U.K., Russia and China. [The deal's
non-U.S. signatories opposed the Trump administration's withdrawal and

[The damage to Saudi Arabia's security and regional standing will expand
further if Iran retaliates against Trump's withdrawal from the JCPOA by
reviving its uranium enrichment program]{.underline}. Although Iran has
vowed to uphold its JCPOA commitments and all other signatories continue
to participate in the agreement, Iranian president Hassan Rouhani also
refused to rule out the revival of Iran's uranium enrichment efforts.
[As Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman recently stated that
his country would procure a nuclear weapon if Iran restarted its nuclear
program.]{.underline} Thus, the collapse of the JCPOA has led to a
revival of speculation about Saudi Arabia's nuclear ambitions. This
scrutiny comes at an inopportune time for Saudi Arabia, [as Riyadh is
currently holding negotiations with the United States to gain
Washington's assistance in developing a civilian nuclear energy
program.]{.underline} As [Saudi Arabia has successfully assuaged the
concerns of U.S. policymakers regarding Riyadh's nuclear weapons
aspirations by stating that its nuclear energy program is only for
peaceful purposes]{.underline}, these negotiations have progressed
considerably**[. A restart of Iran's uranium enrichment program would
raise alarm bells in the United States about a potential arms race in
the Middle East, and could make Washington more reluctant to supply
Saudi Arabia with nuclear technology.]{.underline}** While Saudi Arabia
could still procure support for its civilian nuclear energy program from
Russia and China, [**a withdrawal of U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's
nuclear energy ambitions would be interpreted by other countries in the
Middle East as proof that Riyadh is seeking a nuclear deterrent to
counter the Iranian nuclear threat.** This perception would almost
certainly cause Iran to revive its nuclear program, and could inspire a
massive arms buildup across the Middle East. The UAE is also likely to
join a Saudi Arabia-Iran nuclear arms race,]{.underline} as it has
established the Arab world's first nuclear energy program. Abu Dhabi's
potential procurement of nuclear weapons is a grave concern for Saudi
Arabia, [as a nuclear-armed UAE would no longer be dependent on Saudi
Arabia for security and could promote its pro-secular foreign-policy
vision in ways that undercut Saudi interests.]{.underline} Although
Saudi officials have publicly hailed Trump's decision to withdraw from
the JCPOA, the long-term implications of the U.S. abandonment of the
JCPOA are bleak for Saudi Arabia. [Trump's withdrawal from the Iran
nuclear deal could]{.underline} trigger the emergence of new fault lines
within the GCC, complicate Saudi Arabia's already narrowing path to
victory in Yemen, and [provoke a nuclear arms race in the Middle
East]{.underline}. [The very real prospect of some or all of these
outcomes coming to fruition could cause Saudi Arabia to regret its
triumphalist reaction to Trump's JCPOA withdrawal decision in the years
to come.]{.underline}

### Yes Saudi bomb

#### Saudi can get materials in as little as 5 yrs or just get a bomb for China or Pakistan

[Riyadh could call on China, which sold the Saudis nuclear-capable
missiles, or Pakistan]{.underline}, whose bomb program the Saudis
funded, to base their nuclear weapons on Saudi soil. [China and Pakistan
could do this legally under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty so long
as the nuclear weapons remained under Chinese or Pakistani
control.]{.underline} [The Saudis,]{.underline} however, [would surely
prefer to maintain control themselves, which gives rise to the
possibility of China or Pakistan helping Riyadh acquire the means to
enrich its own uranium]{.underline}. This could be done [by sharing
information]{.underline} that would allow the Saudis to get the parts
and plans needed to complete a plant of their own. Based on an analysis
of past centrifuge enrichment programs, [the Saudis might perfect a
plant in one to three years and produce their first bomb's worth of
uranium a year or so later at a cost of only tens of millions of
dollars]{.underline}. [As for perfecting a nuclear weapons design, this
would likely be accomplished in parallel as has been done in nearly
every other bomb program.]{.underline} Alternatively, [Riyadh might buy
a 1,000-megawatt reactor from one of the major nuclear
suppliers]{.underline} --- the Korea Electric Power Corporation,
Westinghouse, EDF, Rosatom, or China --- bring it online; build a crude,
small reprocessing plant; and separate plutonium from the reactor's
spent fuel. Judging from the recent nuclear experience of the United
Arab Emirates, completing a large power reactor might take roughly a
[decade. If the Saudis made good on their promise to build a smaller
South Korean-designed 100-megawatt electrical power reactor and decided
to construct a small reprocessing plant, Riyadh could conceivably have
its first batch of plutonium for use in weapons in as little as five
years.]{.underline}
